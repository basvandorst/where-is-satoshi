But if the protocol requires the sync flags miners pretty much have to mine them, no? Otherwise the chain would stop growing.

What mechanism does the NG proposal use to share fees? Does each block contain CSV-like gift-to-future-miners outputs?
Also, note that if a user uses out-of-band fees to a specific miner, he has to accept a longer average delay before it is included in a block by that miner. I suppose he could send conflicting versions of the same tx with a different fee recipient to each of the miners directly, bypassing the P2P network.

That average includes very large sendmany / coinjoin txs which are bundles of a large number of original txs. The typical fee for first block confirmation (!) is less than $0.10.
@_date: 2016-08-18 01:22:49
The required fee is based on the size of the tx in bytes, not in BTC. Have you received a large number of txs of less than 1 BTC? If so, that might explain it.

@_date: 2016-04-09 10:36:11
Heh, I thought you were talking about r/btc.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:57:04


A channel doesn't really have an address, it is tied to a specific unspent tx output, which is why you need a txid + output index to identify it. Once you spend to an address, an amount of bitcoin ends up in an unspent output, but different spends to the same address will end up in different outputs, while the channel itself is tied to one specific output. So an address doesn't give you enough information to identify a channel.


By neighbour of a node I mean another node it has an open channel with, not just a node it can reach over the internet. Internet connectivity is a given, and reaching someone through an IP address or Tor hidden service identifier is straightforward.


The point of LN is to have nodes that are connected through payment channels. Once one of these nodes is elected as one of the beacons, it will typically already have some channels open with various other nodes and in addition further nodes may try to establish channels once they learn of the new beacon's identity.


I'm only talking about routes of payment channels, assuming Internet connectivity as a given.


Once you broadcast the information that allows people to know that two channels connect to the same node, you've given away information, though not necessarily information that can be linked to a real world identity. LN uses source routing, which means that the sender does need some sort of (possibly partial) map of the channels in the network.

Cheaper is not the same as fewer hops. And it is not self-evident there is a net centralising incentive as the need to lock in capital acts as a disincentive to run large nodes.

You really should stop shitposting. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:49:22


Yes, as more people try to transact, they start getting in each other's way. As a result, tx fees will rise and txs will end up being sorted by priority and some low priority txs will move elsewhere, most likely LN which offers a superior experience.
In other words the problem will solve itself, and talk of an imminent collapse is indeed alarmist nonsense.
@_date: 2016-04-27 10:35:01
That's a great link to point people to. Really puts the alarmist nonsense into perspective.
@_date: 2016-04-03 21:03:15
I think there are two interesting tx fees: next block and 24 hours. For most txs, the latter matters, which is $0.001 to $0.01.
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:22:34
This is precisely why it is so important that a majority of the hashing power runs from people's homes, behind Tor. That way very few people own more than 1% of the total hashing power and the majority is anonymous and therefore hard to coerce and also in a difficult position to collude.
@_date: 2016-04-11 16:59:08
I believe the suggestion is to use proximity of a node ID to a block hash using some suitable distance function, but I haven't seen any details.
@_date: 2016-04-14 17:00:26
The counterparty could only delay txs. That would be annoying but nothing more than that. To guard against this it would be good to open multiple channels.

@_date: 2016-04-03 17:42:31
But very many txs pay less than $0.01 and still get confirmed within hours, often less than an hour. So $0.08 by no means represents a typical fee.

You cannot have a balance that's higher than the total amount of Bitcoin locked in a channel, but for most people that shouldn't be a problem. My private checking account rarely exceeds 3000 euros, so if I had a set of LN channels with a total worth of 3000 euros in BTC, I'd be fine.

Thread title:


@_date: 2016-04-14 16:59:31
Suppose Amy wants to send 0.3BTC to Bob. Amy knows a route of payment channels to a beacon node B: Amy -&gt; N1 -&gt; N2 -&gt; B. Bob also knows a route to B: Bob -&gt; N3 -&gt; B. Amy can now concatenate her own route to B with the reverse of Bob's route: Amy -&gt; N1 -&gt; N2 -&gt; B -&gt; N3 -&gt; Bob.
Both Bob and Amy can efficiently obtain routes to B because newly elected beacons announce their presence to their neighbours (or these neighbours detect them themselves), who then announce their shortest route to the beacon to their neighbours, who prepend the channel over which they received the announcement, and announce the resulting route to their neighbours if it's better than the previous route if any.

For making on-chain payments from LN you might not even need someone else to close a channel, someone might be willing to make blockchain payments in exchange for LN payments and vice versa.
@_date: 2016-04-08 19:17:42


An oft-made and oft-corrected mistake. Addresses that start with 3 are P2SH, not necessarily multisig. Multisig doesn't even have to be P2SH, you can have 'bare' multisig, but I believe such txs aren't relayed by default and are rare.
@_date: 2016-04-18 21:54:29
Maybe you are concerned about finding the precise UTXO given only node IDs?
There could be multiple channels between any two given nodes, but in the example Amy -&gt; N1 -&gt; N2 -&gt; B I assumed for simplicity that there would only be one channel between each pair of nodes. It doesn't really matter much for the example.
The real identity of a channel would be the txid + output index specifying the UTXO holding the money. This identity cannot be computed by a simple formula from the node IDs (here represented by the strings 'Amy', 'N1', 'N2', 'N3', 'B', 'Bob') as both sides would choose brand new keys to control it. But both sides of a channel would of course know the node ID of the counterparty on the other side of the channel. So leaving them out of the notation is good enough for our purposes here.
Beacons announce the fact that they are beacons to the nodes they currently have channels open with.
B: Hey N2, I'm now a beacon!
N2: (tells its own neighbours about its route to B)
N2: Hey N1, I've now got a route to a beacon, namely N2 -&gt; B.
N1: (tells its own neighbours about its route to B)
N1: Hey Amy, I've now got a route to a beacon, namely N1 -&gt; N2 -&gt; B.
--&gt; Amy now knows of a route Amy -&gt; N1 -&gt; N2 -&gt; B.
A similar story holds for Bob.
Does this help?

Two interesting points:

Amy and Bob can negotiate the route amongst themselves. Each gives the other the set of routes from themselves to a few beacons. As long as they have at least one beacon in common they have all the information they need to patch together a route.
@_date: 2016-04-19 18:04:10
I don't think so, though the miners certainly do have influence, and everyone wants them on their side.
@_date: 2016-04-16 09:52:55
From the linked post:


(emphasis added)
Wrong, this is not the only way. One very important other way is to facilitate payments in the other direction made by third parties. If Bob's channel is full, he is in an excellent position to do that. He can even earn some fees that way. It might not be much, but it would offset his own LN tx fees.
The post misleadingly talks about hubs, but hub-and-spokes is not the intended topology and the problems identified in the post are really problems with using LN in hub-and-spokes mode, not with LN itself. These problems  actually provide an incentive to use LN with its intended topology, which is a mesh network.
@_date: 2016-04-19 20:07:36


It does no such thing.
@_date: 2016-04-10 14:17:24
Earlier today the fee recommended by 21 was $0.01 for confirmation in 1 to 2 blocks. Your estimates still look alarmist to me.
@_date: 2016-04-12 06:38:21
It's similar, but there are significant differences too. With LN there is no counterparty risk, the actual txs aren't stored in a global ledger (only the opening and closing tx for channels are), txs are denominated in Bitcoin, you need to lock in money to be able to receive money and the whole system uses a different consensus algorithm.

What are you talking about? LN will do routing with beacon nodes that are periodically elected by a pseudo-random process.
@_date: 2016-04-08 13:59:39
Note that it's not just miners who refuse to build on invalid blocks, all full nodes will refuse to recognise them as valid. Even SPV wallets do some validation, so even if everyone used SPV wallets our confused friend would still not be correct for all changes.
It is true however that hashing power decides soft forks, in other words miners can unilaterally enforce stricter rules.

If that party is well-connected you can use the channel to pay anyone.
@_date: 2016-04-11 16:33:26
The suggestion so far was to use beacon nodes that are periodically selected by a pseudo-random process. Neighbour nodes of the beacon nodes would broadcast their shortest route to their neighbours who would broadcast to their neighbours etc. Every time a node learns a better path to a beacon node, it would broadcast that too. Very soon every node that was reachable from a beacon node would learn the shortest paths to its reachable nodes. Two nodes that share a reachable node could then construct a path. Routing would not be limited to these paths running through beacons and you could continue to use old beacons. The beacon system is just an efficient algorithm to find paths between arbitrary nodes. Rusty has recently referred to the beacons as landmarks, which may be a better name.
@_date: 2016-04-08 15:00:14
Yeah I know, and I agree, I was just pointing out it is true for soft forks.

Inadvertently forking people off the chain isn't any fun.
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:52:19
To have a dense mesh most nodes should indeed have multiple channels, but you don't have to open and close them all the time. It is still true that you cannot receive more than the total value locked into all your channels combined. But it's not a problem if an individual channel is full, because channels will fluctuate as they facilitate third party payments.
@_date: 2016-04-20 07:09:58
LN does have a central ledger, the Bitcoin blockchain. It only uses it for settlement though, which makes it scale much better. Note that Ripple records each tx in a central ledger, which means it doesn't scale well. But for now the main reason for its relative centralisation is that its consensus algorithm cannot be relied upon to reach a consensus if there isn't a densely connected core of validating nodes.
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:12:41
I explained one such mechanism using beacons in this very conversation. Nodes do not broadcast who their neighbours are, they broadcast complete routes to beacons and concatenate these when routing to a specific destination.
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:09:50
Well, noob to the debate then.
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:38:26


It is safe to assume that people who lock money for the benefit of others will want some reward for this, in other words charge interest. But to open a channel it isn't required that both sides lock some money. If only one side does it that means they won't be able to receive payments until they have spent some money. In ordinary life it isn't unusual for people to receive their salary mostly when their current account is close to being empty.


The number of hops isn't the only consideration, the qualities of the individual nodes (reputation for timeliness, trustworthiness, anonymity etc) also matter. Someone wanting to make illicit payments might not want to route them through Coinbase for instance.


Lots of people already have Bitcoin, locking them into LN could eventually be very similar to "locking" cash into a bank account, in other words not a problem at all, maybe even more convenient than conventional ways of holding Bitcoin in a spending wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:28:52
It's not too difficult to open a channel that isn't full. For 1 BTC plus a fee, an exchange might be willing to create a 2 BTC channel of which 1 BTC is owned by Bob. Or Bob could spend some money from his existing channel and end up with a channel that's no longer full. Or he could open a channel with a friend, with both of them putting up some BTC. Or next time he wants to make a payment to a merchant who supports LN, he might create a channel to that merchant and allocate all funds to the merchant.

Oh I think an important part of it is signalling. 'Interesting proposal you have there, but it would be a shame if a significant fraction of miners ran full RBF, as that could turn your company into a big smoking crater.'
But there is room for compromise. The Blockchain Alliance might prefer BIP 101 and greatly desire control over the protocol, but what they really need urgently is breathing space. The pro-decentralisation camp on the other hand might prefer the status quo, but have already accepted 2-4-8 and could accept +4MB every other year up to 32MB, and maybe beyond.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:54:55
It's an unacceptable solution. There is no consensus for it and a supermajority of miners is against it.

Hence the hard fork block size increase afterwards. There is no pressing reason the hard fork needs to go first for that, and a soft fork can be done sooner.


There can always be another uncontentious hard fork later if that's what we want. The reason to do it as a soft fork first is that it provides immediate relief and is probably the fastest meaningful scaling step we can deploy.


I don't think it is, but I proposed merging and deploying the (as yet inactive) hard fork first, before deploying SW as a soft fork, in order to allay such fears.


That's not realistic, LN will eventually need either bigger blocks, or something more advanced like braided blockchains or proofchains. And a straightforward block size increase will likely be needed before such advanced solutions are ready.

It's not that simple, because if fees were zero people would simply use Bitcoin as a free distributed datastore. At low enough cost, blocks will always fill up.

Their definition of failure might differ from yours or mine.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:12:24
SW isn't intended as a long term scaling solution, it's useful in and of itself (it solves the malleability problem) and it is an important step towards LN, which is a true scaling solution. As a bonus it also serves as a small block size increase and does so as a soft fork!
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:25:20
Also strongly depends on what miners do. If a significant percentage run full RBF, then all bets are off. If all of them run opt-in RBF then even if only 1% of users/wallets do not set the flag, that decision will still be respected. That's a big difference between the two.
Note that I find the premise improbable: market forces will likely push wallets that don't play nice with zero-conf in the short term into a niche outside retail and web stores. Core might get away with it since it is probably not widely used for those purposes, but other wallets likely wouldn't.
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:49:50

@_date: 2015-12-27 19:04:05
It doesn't things worse in that it doesn't make harmful uses of RBF any easier. All RBF txs generated by Core will come with a big fat warning flag. Unfortunately it also doesn't make it any better, but there's nothing you can do against that, precisely because a prohibition on RBF cannot be enforced.

If we are going to do a hard fork at short notice (and I oppose that), then at least do it properly and combine the bump to 2MB with linear growth to 8MB over a number of years.
@_date: 2015-12-24 10:11:25


No, I prefer to see it deployed as a soft fork because that's less risky (and faster). Generally speaking I would prefer a soft fork whenever possible. Whether your security is downgraded a bit depends on whether you upgrade yourself, so if you don't, then it's your own fault.


Not a very useful distinction. When I make a payment through my bank, my bank's systems interface with TARGET2, the Eurozone settlement system. I don't have to know anything about the internals, and I don't really care, except out of professional interest as a programmer and as a Bitcoin enthusiast. Note that Bitcoin as it is can handle a tx volume similar to that of TARGET2.


Security isn't lowered and privacy is even improved. And throughput is improved *massively*.

China doesn't have bad internet, it has a Great Firewall of China that restricts traffic both ways. From the point of view of the majority of hashing power it's the rest of the miners that are on the wrong side of the firewall. That means that it's non-Chinese miners who will see their blocks orphaned.
So it's not the fate of Chinese miners that's at stake, but that of everybody else.

I don't think there's any difference between what you're calling thin blocks and the Relay Network. This optimisation has been applied already and we can expect no more improvements from it.

He is making some good points, but there's a lot of Orwellian sophistry claiming that increasing the block size is more conservative than changing it. Also the narrow business interests of BitPay do not trump the interests of the rest of the ecosystem or the whole point of having a decentralised currency.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:49:09
This looks cleaner than extension blocks, but the main advantage I see is that it allows us to increase the block size faster, yet in a responsible way. As you know I don't think we need an immediate increase, but many people do. The fact that they don't want this solution suggests they have ulterior motives however.
@_date: 2015-12-24 15:15:43


Yes, and that can still happen and likely will still happen. It just won't happen before May, which is too soon, or before things like IBLT and weak blocks have been tested.

I read it and I don't think it's a very good article. I agree SW is good on its own, and also that it is more elegant to do it as a hard fork. However, in general I believe we should avoid hard forks as much as possible quite independently of the scaling issue. Luke's soft fork trick is a great find that can be used for lots of other soft fork upgrades.

@_date: 2015-12-13 16:09:47
That's true, but I'm not sure what your point is. The major miners are all connected to the Relay Network already and something like this could be integrated into the main Bitcoin network too. The same goes for IBLT, which takes this even further. And is working on that I believe.
IIRC the Relay Network sends just 2 bytes (!) for each tx in a block to its peers if it knows the peer already has it.

Also bear in mind that people using SW-enabled wallets use less space in the old section of the block, thus also making room for unupgraded wallets. They'll likely have a fee advantage, thus creating an incentive for people to switch to SW-enabled wallets and an incentive for wallet developers to include SW support.

It's similar to the rippling mechanism in Ripple (in both its old and new form, there's no real difference as it's not the rippling mechanism itself that changed), but with important differences. If you use LN you would *not* have counterparty risk, though you would have exchange rate risk. You could also use a variant of LN for coloured coins, and then you would have IOUs and counterparty risk, just as with Ripple.

It's hard to read to what degree companies like Coinbase and BitPay really fear a "fee event" soon after the upcoming halving because it could also be a scare tactic to bounce people into a rushed decision. My guess is that they're not really worried about making the deadline and would be happy with an increase early in 2017, although they might not admit it.
Or at least, they would be happy as far as fees are concerned. Wanting control over the protocol and disassociating Bitcoin from its cypherpunk roots would remain long-term strategic goals for them.
In the short term they would most likely be principally interested in keeping low tx fees for txs facilitated by themselves. That is something they could do quite easily on top of SW, regardless of what wallets do, even without something like 2-4-8 or BIP-"202".

I think you're missing the fact that change addresses, efficiency and privacy considerations complicate the situation. There is a "safe" variant of RBF, first-seen-safe RBF or FSS RBF, which would prohibit the sort of replacement you're talking about. It checks that all outputs still get paid the same amount or more in a replacement transaction, so no one gets cheated.
This sounds very nice until you realise that there's also a change address which you likely want to *decrease*. You could make an exception for one change address, which would be allowed to decrease, but that involves a privacy loss because you're now revealing which of the outputs is your change address.
You could also keep the rule that all outputs have to increase or stay the same, but then you need to add an additional input. That too involves some privacy loss, and it also requires more bytes.

The Ripple IOU model (which hasn't changed between the old and new Ripple) actually does require trust, so any similarity to Ripple does not argue in favour of your conclusion.

And the only reason they think that there is a crisis is the irresponsible fear-mongering and rabble-rousing by Gavin and Mike. Through a combination of block size increases that keep pace with progress in networking technology and layered systems we can keep the base ledger censorship-resistant while allowing massive numbers of transactions.

I'm not sure we can safely avoid some very high technical limit to stop malicious giant blocks from knocking out nodes that don't have the memory/processing capacity to deal with it without breaking the consensus process. For instance, a Raspberry Pi will likely choke on 1GB blocks. What is and isn't a *valid* block should not depend on how much someone is willing to pay for it. Deciding whether to relay it or not is another matter.
If that limit is high enough, it will only stop malicious blocks without impeding any transactions that aren't designed to break the system.
Someone said the other day the limit used to be 32MB before the 1MB limit was imposed, because that was the maximum size of a Bitcoin protocol message. When I looked at the Bitcoin wiki the other day I got the impression that the size of the message payload is defined in a 32-bit unsigned int, which suggests a limit of 4GB for the block size.
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:30:18


Agreed, such a user would be better off with extension blocks. But from a purity perspective it might be better to keep the base chain entirely self-contained. We can deal with temporary controlled growth to 32MB, because Nielsen's law will allow us to catch up with that sooner or later. It's open-ended growth that I'm worried about.
@_date: 2015-12-01 08:05:17
Correct, if the opt-in flag is not set all you know is that the tx won't be replaced by an opt-in compliant miner. It offers no additional protection against miners following a different policy, but it introduces no new risks while still allowing tx replacement.

It may sound surprising, but Adam's proposed change would actually be a soft work. And unlike hard forks, soft forks are decided by hashing power alone.
In addition, both sides could get what they wanted. 20MB proponents could get their bigger blocks, while opponents could keep their layer-0 base ledger uncompromised. Furthermore, both sides would avoid a damaging breakup.
You'd have two connected chains, where coins can freely move back and forth and where there is still a consensus on the state of the ledger.

Trying to stick to a predetermined 20 year schedule as the 'compromise' proposal here tries to do will go down like a lead balloon. It's DOA.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:52:14
There is already a consensus for SW in Q1 or Q2. It's going to happen whatever people here think. Not that it's contentious, but that's a good point to keep in mind.
That leaves open the question of whether we should also plan a hard fork. My opinion is, yes, as a compromise, and accompanied by strict safeguards. This hard fork should be activated at the earliest responsible moment, which is probably no earlier than early 2017.
@_date: 2015-12-16 08:13:32
The whole point is not to write them to the blockchain all the time. That's what makes it lightning fast and what greatly relieves pressure on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:59:25
I know this is the proposal to set the flag in Core, in fact I stated it myself four posts up.
What this PR does is to let the Core wallet automatically opt in to opt-in RBF, its mining part still will not allow replacement of transactions that do not have the flag set.
As I said above, opt-in means that the miner checks the flag, it has nothing to do with whether a wallet sets it. If it helps, you can imagine the transaction itself making the decision, thereby opting in to the possibility of being replaced by a newer transaction. A transaction that doesn't make that decision can never be replaced. At least not by an opt-in RBF compliant miner.
You have to look at it from the point of view of the miner or the recipient, not the sender. From the recipient's point of view it means that a transaction will only be replaced if it carries a big fat warning, unless it's mined by a non-compliant miner of course.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:58:16
It's not a bad proposal, provided it includes a hard cap, something Garzik has indicated he'd be willing to accept. But it involves a hard fork at very short notice, which should only be used in an emergency. Let's do SW first and do the hard fork early next year. To allay people's fears that this is a stalling tactic let's release a version with a hardcoded vote scheduled for December next year, and do so long before SW is deployed.
@_date: 2015-12-13 14:50:46
~~Don't forget that you also have to transmit the transactions themselves to a couple of peers, not just the blocks.~~
EDIT: you didn't do that.
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:27:05
While I agree with this approach on a technical level, I'm getting more and more worried the miners aren't on board with it. For instance, seems skeptical and, worryingly, reluctant to post here. There is room for compromise, so why not do it?
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:08:22
I don't doubt this is true, they probably did say this, but I have good reason to believe the Core team are talking to BTCC in general and Samson Mow in particular.
@_date: 2015-12-23 13:30:33
OK, no problem in that case then.
@_date: 2015-12-30 11:30:28


Only if absolutely no one uses it. If some people do and you don't, blocks will still effectively be larger.

More importantly, with LN these cups of coffee can still be paid for in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-20 11:32:07
I need to read up a bit more on how this is supposed to work, but it sounds as if you're right. Maybe there are additional reasons you might want very long scripts (sidechains, fraud proofs). Hard to judge how long that might take.
@_date: 2015-12-07 17:45:41
It's a way to effectively raise the limit to 4MB *as a soft fork* as well as fixing malleability, which is important for LN and other advanced smart contract / multisig applications.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:31:38
The chained transactions are all-or-nothing, and a party to a channel can't just revert a transaction. A party might refuse to facilitate the transaction, but they can't revert anything.
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:35:47
Offchain is not the same as centralised or trusted. The Lightning Network would be trustless because all LN txs are Bitcoin txs that can be broadcast to the blockchain at any time.
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:17:53
In other words, you can't come up with an actual citation, just as I thought. The debate isn't helped if people misrepresent the other side's positions.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:43:59


The miner doesn't have to know. If an attacker routes different versions of a transaction to different miners (with different policies) then miners can very easily facilitate double spending attempts in total innocence. This sort of thing has happened before. IIRC someone used this trick to defraud gambling sites.
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:06:02
The problem is that people can lose money during the fork, have Bitcoin they bought in one place not be accepted in another etc. Another possibility is that two variants will coexist serving different niches and that the combined market cap will be less than the market cap before the split.

You mean the implicit 32MB limit imposed by the maximum message size?
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:57:28
I did no such thing. You claimed it would be bad for your privacy if a hub could see all your txs. I tried to point out that if that's true, then putting it in the blockchain would be much worse.
In actuality the hub would know very little about you, and privacy could easily be much better than on-chain, which isn't too bad to begin with as the MtGox fiasco illustrates.
@_date: 2015-12-30 12:01:47


I haven't looked at the code yet. But the proposal is to create new blocks with a single coinbase that includes a Merkle root for all actual txs in that block. I imagine the new chain wouldn't accept old blocks with non-coinbase txs after the switchover date.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:59:06
No it can't. And it still makes the difference between making things worse or not.
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:08:43
Good, now we're getting somewhere. We also agree that this is not enough to run a global payments network and that there needs to be some other reason if people are to run such a network. We further agree that we do still need a global payments network.
Correct so far?
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:01:06
Yeah, but it wasn't a real problem, at least not for desktop machines. Storage capacity is still growing fast and is expected to continue to do so for a long time. And storage requirements only scale linearly.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:41:47
No, the security assumption is not subjective. The assumption is that blocks are of a size that allows a flooding based consensus network to operate. We know this works for 1MB, and we also know that the safe limits will continue to grow for a while based on Nielsen's law.
@_date: 2015-12-24 13:06:30


Only the recipient because they can use P2SH which everybody supports.


Perhaps, but then BitPay and Coinbase have an edge and can push out everybody else until they do in fact generate close to 100% of all tx volume.


OK, but why all the controversy over tx fees then? Just scaremongering?

Blockchains wil remain as revolutionary an idea after such a crash as before it. The Core development team will still remain the most qualified development team in this area. If blockchains are as revolutionary as we think they are, then they are unstoppable in the long term.
@_date: 2015-12-24 11:39:02


I used to think large blockers were the majority, but I'm no longer so sure when I look at the numbers of online users here and on r/btc.


A hard fork isn't safe, and rushing it and trying to do it without a very strong consensus makes it even less safe.


Not without first eliminating the risk of rogue transactions with validation times that scale quadratically with tx size. And even with that in place miners are concerned about anything larger than 2MB for now. ~~also found a limit of between 2MB and 4MB.~~


@_date: 2015-06-07 11:03:00
Yes you do, because if you don't validate the blocks these transactions are in, you are trusting the miners to do the verification for you. Local validation is part of the mechanism to keep miners honest.
@_date: 2015-12-28 13:17:01


Is that estimation based on a study of the actual code?
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:50:02
Agreed, I see this as a very dangerous path.
@_date: 2015-12-24 01:42:26


Temporarily reduce it for people until they upgrade or permanently degrade it with XT. I think the reason is clear.


For roughly double the capacity in the short term (which we don't even need), and a massive increase in capacity through LN in the longer term. Again, the reason is clear.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:33:28
Yes, this is the road towards yearly hard forks and then hardcoded indefinite growth.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:43:45
Sure. And it's equally possible that proofchains, braided blockchains or some other clever data structure will make our current notion of a block size limit irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:41:00
No, let's schedule a hard fork a year in advance. Meanwhile SW will be deployed in Q1 or Q2.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:45:50
Bitcoin won't die. BitPay and Coinbase might. And some tech douchebros might lose their VC-funded jobs. A few rock star developers and talking heads might have to go back to being mere IT grunts. Bitcoin itself will be fine.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:27:25
I'd like to add a mechanism that constrains the vote of the miners to a predefined range that varies with time according to a set schedule. It would have a lower limit that forces a safe increase every year, based on a conservative estimate of the growth of network bandwidth, say 25% per year. It would also have an upper limit that limits the miners' vote to an optimistic estimate, like 75%.
L(n) = 1.25^n
U(n) = 1.75^n
For those who feel we need to accommodate the possibility of a surge in adoption, we could immediately raise the upper limit to 8MB.
L(n) = 1.25^n
U(n) = min( 8, 1.75^n )
Since we can't extrapolate too far into the future, I'd still like to add a fixed hard limit of 20MB or 32MB. We shouldn't try to decide the issue for all time in one go.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:13:46


I'm not making that argument. LN as currently planned would also need bigger blocks to cope with 7B users. I'm pointing out that a) LN + 1MB blocks will scale well enough not to have to worry about the block size for a long time and b) that without taking most transactions off-chain we cannot serve 7B without such large blocks that Bitcoin cannot remain decentralised.
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:29:22
With LN + full node many more people could run a full node because the bandwidth requirements would be much lower than with all txs on-chain.
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:57:49
I think the people who are cautioning against uncontrolled increases may have to do the work and get these systems operational in order to gain a consensus for such a compromise. For many on the increase-now side a quick increase now is much more attractive than the promise of unproven software at some unspecified time in the future.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:27:02


My understanding is that you can in fact get at the 9 BTC and that the timeout is fairly short.


That could only happen if the payment services provider gave away its own money.

That's the big mistake people are making, off-chain does not imply hosted wallet. Hosted wallets are just the simplest form of off-chain solutions. There exist trustless alternatives too, which is what we should be looking at.
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:38:11
Well, that's why I would want a synthesis of all three ideas.
Allow an immediate increase of the block size as Gavin is proposing, but with additional checks and balances. Such checks and balances could include guaranteed minimum growth according to a conservative estimate of Nielsen's law, maximum growth according to an optimistic estimate, a hard cap as in Gavin's proposal, though perhaps higher, votes by both miners and users as proposed by Jeff and Peter, and perhaps limits determined by robust metrics of actual tx volume. This will immediately buy us time to deal with the possibility of a rapid growth in adoption, without the disadvantages of Gavin's proposal.
At the same time we introduce 32MB extension blocks governed by a similar growth mechanism, but without the fixed hard cap. This will allow indefinite noncontentious growth, so hopefully we'll never have to go through something like the current discussion ever again.
Without further work on wallet GUIs most users will not be immediately able to use the extension blocks, but they don't have to because the main chain blocks can still grow to say 32 MB in a controlled way.
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:22:02

I'm not sure he proposed "202" on the list, I can't seem to find it, but there's a whole thread discussing similar topics. I'm trying to make a good-faith contribution and I'm disappointed a double standard appears to be being applied. But fine, so be it.
I was hoping this would lead to a BIP, and the [Wiki page]( says the first step is to submit a proposal to the mailing list. If unsollicited BIPs are no longer welcome on the list, what do I do now, apply directly to Gregory Maxwell for a BIP number?

I think the 32MB message limit1)  is deliberate. It's less practical to have messages of unlimited size, because then you don't know how much memory a device (say a Bitnodes Hardware) needs in order to be compatible with the protocol. That's not to say the limit couldn't or shouldn't be raised eventually.
1) if that's what it is, the size is specified in a 32 bit unsigned int
@_date: 2015-06-14 07:57:18

By contentious I mean there is still significant opposition to it, which makes the transition potentially very painful. People might buy coins from an exchange only to find they can't spend them at another.
Compare this to something like OP_HODL, which had no significant opposition. I know that's a soft fork, but if it had been done as a hard fork with two years lead time, it would not have led to problems.
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:01:04
Citation needed. There's a big difference between accepting fees will have to rise and wanting them to rise.
@_date: 2015-12-06 15:19:36
Exactly. Governments that don't realise this already will find out soon enough that shutting down large mining farms is counterproductive while co-opting farms can give them control.
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:27:02
And it's very important for LN, which will allow massive scaling. We'll still want to increase block sizes eventually, but this is a huge step.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:26:28
First one hard fork, which sets a precedent, then one next year, then the year afterwards, then people say "gee, let's not do this every year, let's hardcode it".

Is the trick to reinterpret transactions that follow a certain pattern in a different way? If so, isn't that exactly the sort of thing was against in the case of P2SH? That would be ironic.
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:51:16
The more people use Bitcoin, the higher the required hash rate to protect it. And the more people use Bitcoin, the higher the price, so the actual hash rate will go up. The system is self-regulating.
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:33:12


Perhaps, but I don't like giving emergency powers to the miners without more checks and balances, a hard cap of at most 32MB and a sunset clause. I don't want to be railroaded into open-ended blockchain growth without another hard fork.

An old Raspberry Pi may be pushing it, but I don't think a new one is unreasonable. The nice thing about a RP is that it can be running in the background even when your desktop computer is off. I wouldn't want to come home at 18:00 and have to wait more than an hour for my full node to catch up. Right now Qt takes minutes to synchronise on my PC, which I already find annoying. Since the RP would be always on, it would require less bandwidth to achieve that goal than a desktop computer which would have to download a day's worth of data in an hour.
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:41:05

@_date: 2015-06-20 15:32:02
A doubling every two years for the next six years doesn't sound too risky. Not necessary either, but also not risky.
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:34:17
They want a censorship-resistant financial system because they believe that will greatly help the cause of liberty, sound money and limited government. You may not share their goals, and may not believe those goals are actually served by Bitcoin, but that's what they believe.
@_date: 2015-06-06 20:42:54
But they have a stake in it too, and actual evidence will be helpful to anyone who is actually trying to have a constructive discussion instead of trying to pull a fast one. I can't check the latest numbers from blockchain.info because it's still down, but the total tx fee per block should be on the order of tens of dollars per block, which is tiny compared to the block reward.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:09:09
I'm talking about safe from the point of view of decentralisation in a flooding based consensus network. Clearly safety in the sense of being able to accommodate massive adoption has additional requirements.
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:07:08


Very interesting indeed, but it looks as if it might radically change the security assumptions underlying Bitcoin. Would it lead to a hierarchical structure or to a geodesic one?
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:04:22
I don't understand what you are saying. There are people who passionately want 20MB blocks and there are people who fear this will lead to more centralisation. Adam's proposal gives both parties what they want. How is that not a good thing?
@_date: 2015-12-19 11:32:02
A more reasonable argument might be that Bitcoin wouldn't cease to exist, but that its price might be needlessly limited.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:02:01
Of course it is. The VC home run model is not the only model for Bitcoin, which can also grow organically with much less risk.
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:49:14

We now also have a new option, doing BIP 102 with the recently disclosed "firm fork" or "forced soft fork" technique, which could be implemented even sooner than SegWit.
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:09:34
For me one of the attractions of Bitcoin is that all users can fully validate their own transactions. Without that you cannot validate there has been no inflation, outright theft, destruction of coins etc.
Other people's mileage may vary, but changing this means a fundamental change in the nature of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:00:34
An automatic increase is dangerous, we don't know how bandwidth will continue to grow. +20% for the next 5 years, maybe 10 sounds reasonable, but beyond that it becomes risky.
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:24:48


As long as the block size doesn't grow so fast that ordinary users can't afford to run a fully validating node over Tor, then that's fine with me. I see no urgency for an increase yet, and haven't been reassured that the proposed increase is small enough. In the long run I'd like to see the hard limit set to a safe, high level with soft limits set by market forces.
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:43:21
Then you should apply that same logic to 20MB blocks. I'm pretty sure LN will give us a factor 20 of scaling.
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:04:57
Sure, but that means they can't do local validation. That removes one of the mechanisms that keeps miners honest.
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:47:08
Why are you only looking at blocks that were found roughly 10 minutes after the last one? Wouldn't it make more sense to look at something like hourly / daily / weekly average # txs per block? After all, that corresponds more closely to the actual bandwidth consumption.
@_date: 2015-06-27 10:20:39
The first two points might happen, but they're not in it primarily for the money. I don't see how the third point could happen if Bitcoin doesn't remain decentralised.
@_date: 2015-06-07 11:53:01
No, you can. Pruning is useful if you want to limit your storage needs, and you don't have to give up security for it. You won't be able to serve people full blocks anymore, but that's fine, not every user and not every device has to do that. It just doesn't help you with reducing your download requirements, unless you are willing to sacrifice some security. And for some users and some devices that too may well be the right choice.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:25:33

@_date: 2015-06-03 19:44:13
The argument is to wait until the evidence is in, not to rush into something irreversible. Fees would rise gradually, so we'd have some time even if they did rise significantly.
@_date: 2015-06-20 07:23:06
I doubt miner revenue will stay at the levels of today after the halving. I'm expecting the total hash rate to drop significantly around that time. A rising Bitcoin exchange rate and technological improvements could make it rise again.
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:25:16


True, but every transaction actually is a balance-setting transaction, so it is useful if the remaining balance is larger than the fee.
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:50:41
I expect it to work soon. Open-Transactions is scheduled to be released in Q3. Hosted wallets are available today.

@_date: 2015-06-15 18:25:34

Isn't there a command-line option for setting the soft limit?
@_date: 2015-06-27 10:51:39
You won't get a consensus without a hard cap. That doesn't mean it can't be increased or even removed later through another hard fork, just that it can't be changed without one. If you want to try to ram through your own preferred policy, by all means leave out the hard cap. But if you want a consensus you're going to need it.
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:23:57

Tor is not decentralised, but distributed.
@_date: 2015-06-07 07:28:30
I'm not sure whether it would end up centralised, I need to give this more thought.
One possibility is using person-to-person payment chains (the way it worked in Ripple Classic), which could still link to a payment provider the merchant supports. Setting up the routing could be done by the sender's wallet. It would take active censorship on the part of the payment providers to stop this.
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:02:45
So? The risk here is not that they destroy Bitcoin, but that they push through further cap increases.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:07:29
Or over Bitmessage, or carrier pigeons.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:23:41
OK, but that was the sort of thing I was complaining about in my text post. I absolutely welcome constructive discussion with 20MB proponents.
@_date: 2015-06-12 20:57:41
I'm not sure what you mean. You could have separate settlement and transaction layers with the same block size, but what would be the advantage of that?

Those two things aren't mutually exclusive.

No it isn't a silly game of semantics, it allows more transactions per block without a hard fork.

I'd love to see that quote.
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:58:10
Malicious miners can fill up blocks with dummy transactions to push out competitors with less bandwidth.
I think we'll have plenty of advance notice for big increases in adoption and an increase in the block size limit can be deployed quickly in such circumstances.

I believe this and the SW soft fork are important parts of what's needed for a truce of a couple of years that nearly everyone can get behind, even if it is only grudgingly.
A hard fork in May sounds unnecessarily risky though, I'd like to have a vote at the end of next year and to depend on SW to give us the initial bump to 2M.

It's intended only to serve *mining nodes*, which is where the delay matters. For non-mining full nodes there is no problem.

I don't think middle nodes need to know either sender or recipient, much as with Tor. And because the transactions don't have to hit the blockchain, this should be more private than on-chain transactions, not less.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:01:48
I think we need to let go of the idea that everybody verifies all transactions without giving up on the idea that everybody verifies (or at least can choose to verify) *their own* transactions. In Bitcoin today you can't do the latter without the former, but if we had separate layers for settlement and transactions we could.
@_date: 2015-12-10 08:28:14
I think a combination of 2-4-8 and SW is an excellent near-term can-down-the-road compromise that a very large supermajority could get behind.
To get early feedback on any effects it might have on block propagation delay and full node count I'd light to see gradual increases without large step functions. To keep it simple I'd like something like +32kb every difficulty adjustment.
This would give everyone breathing space and could keep desperate rogue players from risking a potentially disastrous contentious hard fork.
Ideally I'd like to see a hard fork increasing the block size go first. While it could gather the necessary supermajority for that, it still lacks the pressing urgency that could allow us to do that within weeks or months. Therefore a soft-fork version of SW might have to go first.
Either way I would like all major players to commit to deploying both in the next year as an interim measure.
The hard fork should be triggered by a 95% majority, and expire if the limit isn't reached by the end of next year. If the other side isn't willing to play ball then we don't need the additional uncertainty hanging over us like a sword of Damocles.

Very interesting, if there's going to be a voting mechanism, then I'd want one that gives end users a voice. But doesn't the current proposal take away the option for a miner to speak his own mind, uninfluenced by fees?
Maybe we should have a miners' vote and a users' vote, just as many countries have bicameral legislatures. Maybe miners could vote by producing additional proof of work as someone has suggested?
And just as we don't let legislatures decide everything by simple majority vote, but constrain them by constitutions that can only be amended by a supermajority and ratification by citizens or states, we should have protocol rules that put limits on the outcome of the votes. Those limits could only be changed with a noncontentious hard fork, which is as it should be.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:47:05

No, that is not the argument. The cap should be set to the highest *safe* value and below that cap market forces can set the block size. As time goes by the safe limit will increase due to technological advances. There is no need to restrict transactions artificially.
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:46:10


That's not true, things just go faster if that's the case. You could also use e-mail or bitmessage or even snail mail as a transport layer.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:20:09
No, it's not being melodramatic, this is open-ended growth, unless the 32MB cap on protocol messages is intended to stay, as may be saying elsewhere.
As for influencing the size down, I'd be perfectly happy with checks and balances that could counter that, and have made a specific proposal.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:48:18
Would you be opposed to combining this with Adam's proposal of extension blocks and Gavin's hard limit?
The deal could be that we empowered miners to increase the size of layer-0 blocks up to 20 MB, or perhaps the original limit of 32 MB, through a controlled process, without the risk of a damaging hard fork, provided we also added the extension block mechanism. Layer-1 extension blocks could have their own hard cap set exclusively by miner's votes, much as you are proposing here.
Those who want larger blocks would get the ability to deal with a surge in adoption quickly, while those who are concerned for decentralisation get a guarantee that the layer-0 block size will not grow beyond 32MB without a further protocol upgrade. Those who are concerned about the complexity of wallet upgrades to take advantage of layer-1 blocks can rest assured that the option to increase the layer-0 blocks to 32 MB buys them time.

Thin blocks between peers using the normal network protocol, i.e. not the Relay Network currently used by miners, are a useful improvement, and is already working on IBLT inside the network protocol, which is a much more advanced form of it.

But that law itself is censorship.
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:22:55
Because we'll be in a much better position to solve the scaling problem then without compromising decentralisation and without so much controversy. All sorts of systems we're speculating about now would be operating then, so be could actually measure their effectiveness.
All we need to do now is to avoid a damaging controversial hard fork and  ourselves enough time to come to a considered decision that takes everybody's goals and concerns. An immediate increase to 8MB would be more than enough.

Blocks are currently 40% full, half of which consists of sub $1 txs. You say blocks will fill up in two years, Rusty Russell is expecting two to three years. Even so, we can live with the sub $1 segment being pushed out temporarily. Where's the urgency?
The patch is ready, and can be deployed quickly should the need arise. There's a real probability that either Open Transactions or LN arrives in time to prevent the need for an increase for a long time to come. There's no pressing need to decide anything now, especially since there is a controversy about this.
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:24:19
I have never been heavily involved in Ripple. But it's interesting to see that you seem to view Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme that is threatened by rival systems, rather than someone who wants to see the idea of cryptocurrencies succeed. It totally fits with the unflattering revelations by about your paid shilling.
@_date: 2015-06-02 18:40:16


I agree, but I wonder what is a safe limit. After all, we don't want to create artificial scarcity either. I get the impression that 20MB is still small enough to run full nodes behind Tor. I'm not sure what the impact of the block propagation delay is, which is presumably worse behind Tor anyway.
Not that I think 20MB is in any way urgent: I get the feeling that a lot of unsophisticated Bitcoin advocates are being taken for a ride by people who have some sort of near-term business interest in increasing the block size limit.
@_date: 2015-12-01 19:52:28
Responded too :-)
I stand corrected, I missed the bit at the end. This caveat invalidates much of the criticism in the main section though. Wallets that do not offer the ability to make zero-conf payments with the flag disabled will either disappear quickly, or merchants who accept zero-conf will. I think the former is much more likely in the short term.
The article does make an excellent argument against deploying *full* RBF right now though, assuming open warfare doesn't break out in the ecosystem.

We should not be taking Chinese miners into consideration because we want to mollycoddle them, but because they have more than half the hash rate. If we don't take the limitations imposed by the Great Firewall of China seriously, it's all miners *outside* China that will see their blocks orphaned.

I think that's a very real possibility. The best remedy I can think of is to have lots of above board hubs to provide "substantial noninfringing use" and a dense network of hubs run from people's homes over Tor / I2P that is very resilient to government repression.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:43:53
Certainly, but then it wouldn't be trustless and censorship-resistant.

No, it doesn't. Storage does scale linearly, but bandwidth doesn't, unless you decentralise and / or move most transactions off-chain.
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:50:45
Not sure what he meant. I agree servers don't solve the problem, but maybe he meant the technology already exists and can be expected to be rolled out to consumers over time.
The capacity of fiber is so high that the cabling itself won't be a limiting factor anytime soon. And even if the last couple of hundred meters are over copper, replacing the rest with glass fiber can lead to great increases in bandwidth.
What we don't know is how long it will take. We also only need to kick the can down the road. A couple of years from now we'll be in a much better position to make decisions and to get a consensus for it.
I think doubling the block size every two years for the next ten years would be fine. If necessary, we could allow an immediate bump to 4-8 MB until the doubling catches up. The 32 MB message size limit provides a natural hard cap.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:22:15
I'm only talking about safety of the security assumptions underlying the flooding based consensus network. We know that such a network can handle 1MB now. That's enough to make Bitcoin a digital gold. It's not enough to make it a world currency.
@_date: 2015-12-01 15:49:46
RBF is not something that creates fee pressure, it's growing adoption in combination with a block size limit that do that. RBF actually reduces fee pressure because it allows companies that send lots of txs to do so in fewer bytes. It also makes it easier not to overpay when a fee market does develop.

The relevant comparison is not full nodes today vs full nodes at some time in the past, but full nodes today vs what is required to keep (or make) the system strongly censorship-resistant. And the needed amount of decentralisation is both difficult to determine and changes with technological progress.
One criterion I like is what percentage of the population can conveniently validate their own transactions fully. Note that I'm not saying a large number of people need to actually do that, just that it they could easily and cheaply do it if they wished to do so.
With the current design of Bitcoin validating your own transactions requires validating everybody else's transactions too, but if we split Bitcoin into a validation layer and one or more transaction layers that could change. Everybody could then afford to validate the base layer, without being forced to validate transactions they don't care about.
@_date: 2015-12-28 15:00:36
Don't be a dick.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:24:52
It becomes more and more difficult / expensive to run a fully validating node as the block size grows. It also becomes more and more difficult to do it behind Tor.
Counterbalancing that is progress in networking technology. Bandwidth has followed Nielsen's law (+50% per year), but like Moore's law that can't continue indefinitely. We don't know what the end state will be, and there can be periods of great unsafety before then.
@_date: 2015-12-28 00:46:53
In what way is he 
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:40:37
Sure, I would like and expect SW to be activated around the halving, though not necessarily before it. I sent a detailed and motivated proposal for a temporary truce based on something very similar to BIP202 + SW to the bitcoin-dev mailing list on Wednesday, but to my great annoyance it was rejected by the moderators and now is in limbo pending an appeal from which Jeff has recused himself.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:23:58


And it is equally ridiculous to suggest it be determined by a vote among miners. Safety aside, the block size should be set by individual miners.
@_date: 2015-06-27 12:21:19
That's a different question. Do you deny that a Bitcoin that didn't rely on well-hidden nodes running in people's homes would be no more able to resist government than Napster?

Heheh. They really do need to fix that. I hope they go back to work on Streamium after the Decentraland intermezzo.
@_date: 2015-12-26 20:26:59


Let's check if we're starting from the same assumptions.
LN requires users to run LN nodes, which need not be but probably are full Bitcoin nodes as well. Each LN node establishes a payment channel with a small number of other randomly selected LN nodes, much like a Bitcoin node today connects to a randomly chosen set of peers.
LN nodes know each other by some pseudonymous cryptographic ID. There is no need for them to know each other's real identity or IP address, and it's better for privacy if they don't. Note that randomly selecting peers only works because LN is trustless. This wouldn't work for Ripple for example, despite some similarities between the two systems. The connected nodes form a densely connected mesh that has no relationship to real-world social graphs.
When you make a payment, your own node needs to find a path through the mesh, probably by consulting some global database. This is similar to what Ripple does today, but with fewer privacy concerns because the identities of the nodes are basically unknowable and nodes can change their IDs periodically. More advanced variants might try to use some sort of ant routing to avoid needing a globally visible graph of payment channels, but I'm not sure that can scale.
When your node has established a path, it uses onion routing to send the payment to its destination, so no hop along the way knows both the sender and recipient's cryptonym. The first hop knows the sender's cryptonym, but not his real-world identity, the last hop knows the recipient's cryptonym, but again not his real-world identity. The nodes in the middle only know the cryptonym of the previous hop and the next hop.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:05:18
That why I'm proposing is controlled growth from 2MB to 8MB starting in 2017.
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:08:26
My own two cents: I believe it would be best to keep the 1MB limit intact, and to depend on LN, Open Transactions and sidechains for scaling. We can always roll out an increase to say 8MB if it becomes urgent and do so quickly. In the longer term I expect us to be able to raise the limit considerably without risk, though with treechains it's not even certain that would be needed.
However, given the great controversy I'd be willing to compromise to avoid a potentially very dangerous controversial hard fork. An immediate increase to 8MB with controlled growth over a number of years to the original limit of 32MB would buy us enough time to see if proposed alternatives will work.
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:38:43
If it's combined with a hard super cap of 20 MB it's still superior to Gavin's proposal isn't it?
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:30:25
The newly disclosed "firm fork" technique could play a role in this.
Core have said they want to wait to see how well weak blocks and IBLT perform before committing to anything more than 2MB, and at least one major miner also considers this extremely important. They expect the information to be in by the end of the year.
A firm fork could be rolled out very soon after the information is in, and would not need a lead time of a year (from the point of view of the smaller blocks camp), unlike a hard fork. This way we don't lose another year, from the point of view of the bigger blocks camp.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:03:35
I'm not necessarily saying there won't be a problem for some reasonable use cases next year, I'm only saying you need to look at fees, not blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:38:58
None of this is irreversible. They could finish this experiment in two weeks time, and then bitcoin.org could relist them.
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:44:10
Storage isn't the problem, bandwidth is, though not for 20MB blocks. Also, the block propagation delay, which leads to centralisation because it favours larger pools over smaller ones.
But scaling the block size alone will not nearly be enough to scale to 7B users. If becomes very expensive to run a full node if all transactions have to occur on-chain.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:55:34
Could you add a graph of nodes running as Tor hidden services?

@_date: 2015-06-26 21:54:53


I don't think we can know this with certainty.
I do think we can't have niche stability without mass adoption if governments don't actively suppress Bitcoin. If Bitcoin does achieve stability and people are free to start using it, then it will immediately become much more useful to people, which should lead to huge demand and consequently instability, which is a contradiction.
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:49:40
I suppose it also creates the risk that coins that have been tainted by an excursion to 20MB land can never be fully verified by a main-chain-only full node.
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:20:29
My own answer:
It's crucial that Bitcoin becomes the preferred currency of the black market. I don't think we can keep Bitcoin resistant to censorship if we don't succeed in making it safe for the black market.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:44:59
No, the fact that blocks are full is not an indication that the situation is urgent. You have to look at tx fees to be able to tell if the situation is urgent. And even if it is urgent, that doesn't make it any less dangerous, which is the argument that was being made.

@_date: 2015-12-19 14:15:17
Yeah, the concern is outgrowing the 2MB the miners think is safe too soon. SW in May 2016 would add 1MB almost immediately since it should require little work for BitPay and Coinbase to adapt. That means that we'd be at the edge of what's believed to be safe already. Gradual growth of 20kb/adjustment on top of that and doubled by a similar growth of the witness section would mean +1MB/year, which may be too fast for the first few years. It seems fine afterwards, as long as its capped by something reasonable, like 8M or 32M in ten years time.
@_date: 2015-12-31 11:49:52
LN channels are far more powerful than the payment channels currently used by Streamium. They are bidirectional and use multi-hop routing. They are much faster than Bitcoin payments and don't require bandwidth per transaction from every full node in the world. You might still want to do high value transactions directly on the Blockchain, but for most payments LN is a superior experience and it scales much better.
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:43:27
@_date: 2015-06-12 07:19:14
This is a very important point, I think you should make a new text post for it so more people will see and discuss it.
A fixed increase for a finite period of time might be acceptable, as we can indeed expect bandwidth to continue to grow for a decade or so, perhaps longer. But I think a layered system of blockchains will work better and then we can eventually upgrade the base layer once we have a better picture of what will happen.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:43:31
I fully understand Bitcoin cannot be fully decentralised, popular and fully on-chain. In fact I've been doing my best to explain that to people. You ask, what good is Bitcoin as a money if it can't serve everyone. I ask, what good is it if it isn't decentralised? After all, we already have many centralised payments systems that are more efficient to boot. Bitcoin's value lies in its decentralised, censorship-resistant nature.
What we need to give up is not decentralisation or popularity, but the fully on-chain character. Fortunately this can be done in a trustless manner, so we can in fact almost have our cake and eat it.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:45:43

That's what I'd expect too, but surely the Chinese mining pools know this too. What do they know that we don't?
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:13:17
It's not true there is no risk, because there is the risk of manipulation through spam transactions. I agree there is some value in having the flexibility to respond quickly, but I believe we can respond quickly anyway and would like to preserve the flexibility of using another solution than increasing the block size.
I think we need more data to reach a consensus. We need more analysis and experiments to figure out what the real probabilities and consequences are.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:35:24
But then we have to schedule it just about now. A hard fork should have a lead time of a year or more unless we are in a dire emergency, which we're not. The core developers want to wait until after the results of IBLT and weak blocks are in.

When payment channels are used to pay for illegal downloads? When people crowd-source leaks of secret government documents? When the ability of central banks to conduct monetary policy is threatened, when the tax man has difficulty collecting taxes? When prediction markets take off?
Remember what happened to Napster, which was only a threat to the copyright cartel, not to governments themselves.

Not quite for free as bandwidth still costs money. And for now the block propagation delay also makes mining larger blocks less profitable.

It does not address the concerns of those who feel that larger blocks are a threat to decentralisation. Perhaps you don't agree with their concerns, but it does mean that from their perspective it's not a compromise at all.
Adam Back's proposal on the other hand would be a real compromise, although not necessarily one that deals with all concerns of those who want larger blocks soon.
Personally I'd like to see a synthesis of the three proposals.

I'm pretty sure we can find a solution in the next couple of years.

The biggest problem is that Chinese miners own a majority of the hashing power. From the perspective of that majority it's the rest of us that are on the wrong side of the firewall. If blocks become so large that the firewall becomes a problem, then it's miners outside China who will see their blocks orphaned.
That is, assuming BitFury doesn't already have a majority of hashing power in Georgia, on our side of the GFW.

It depends on how quickly the blockchain grows vs how quickly network technologies improve. It's hard to predict. I think I personally could run a full node at home at 20MB per block, especially with a dedicated Raspberry Pi. I'm optimistic I'll be able to deal with 1GB blocks ten years from now. I'm not sure I'll be able to deal with 17GB blocks ten years from now if all 10B people make a tx a day.
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:49:55
True, but that would be dealt with by the ability to increase the layer-0 block size up to 20 MB, or 32 MB, the original limit. That should buy us enough time, especially since it's 20 MB proponents who have been telling us it would be enough.

That's not the question because Bitcoin as is cannot scale to 7B users without taking most txs off-chain. It would be nice if it could, but it can't. Quadratic scaling is a bitch.

Please don't ruin the party for those who are eager to keep Bitcoin decentralised. We can and will scale to thousands of txs per second without giving up decentralisation.
It should remain a long term goal that most users can afford to validate their own transactions completely. It's not necessary for everybody to actually do this, just that a substantial majority of consumers could choose to do this without undue cost and difficulty.
Right now, the only way to do that is to validate everybody's transactions. In the long run and maybe even in the near future that may no longer be possible.
We can however move to a model where anyone who wants to can fully validate a layer-0 base ledger that works much like Bitcoin today, though perhaps with a somewhat higher block size limit. On top of that there would be a secondary layer-1 ledger that most people would only validate partially, for their own transactions.
Adam Back has [proposed]( this, he calls it extension blocks, and he says it could be deployed on the same date that Gavin's proposal could.

Both probably need to be implemented, but raising the block size too far or too fast carries all sorts of risks. I don't think there is a camp that wants no change at all, although I see that accusation a lot. The disagreement is over the timing and size of increases.
It's true that we can't realistically change the subsidy, but my point was that it provides an additional rationale for a limit: to counteract artificially low tx fees.

Not at all, you can use multiple servers and e-mail adresses, you could host one yourself, which needn't be on all the time as intermediate smtp servers will store and forward mail. Bitmessage is like an extreme form of that, it's a broadcast network without a centralised point of failure.

If you want to be able to spend x BTC, you're going to need x BTC, just as with a bank account. I'm not sure you'd call this locking it up. Similarly, if the intermediary wants to be able to pay you y BTC, he has to lock up y BTC.


How could there be double spends? You are repeatedly making new balance agreements. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 07:47:30
It is true your proposal includes some checks and balances, but not enough checks and balances, and above all no hard cap. It is true that this is controlled growth, but it is also open-ended. That gives the miners a great amount of power that cannot be revoked without a hard fork.
It's like taking
*Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.*
and turning it into
*Treason against the United States, shall consist in grave acts against the interests of the United States, as determined by special legislation passed by the House of Representatives with the consent of the President and Vice President.*
I'd like to repeat a point made by that I have been quoting over the past few days:




We need some mechanism to determine what's safe and again has some good suggestions.
Below that safe limit, there is no need to impose centralised rules on the size of blocks, market forces can take care of that. We don't need High Priests dictating that we should have a voting mechanism for determining the most economical block size any more than we need High Priests declaring the limit themselves.
The only reason we might need a vote is that there is a competing, also valid, concern namely the ability to accommodate much larger adoption in the near future. That tension is difficult to resolve through some fixed algorithm. The fact that it needs to be done soon, either because you think it's really necessary or only necessary to avoid a damaging hard fork, makes it even more difficult. From that point of view a vote is reasonable.
But it's only an emergency decision taken under pressure. History teaches us emergency powers should come with clear limits and sunset clauses. And even ordinary legislation isn't simply taken by simple majority vote. It is also constrained by constitutional safeguards that can only be changed by a supermajority, subject to ratification by citizens and/or states.
All we need now is an emergency compromise that gives us time to come up with a better long term solution, in other words, kicking the can down the road as Gavin says. It's neither needed nor desirable to try to come up with a solution that fixes the scaling problem for all times. 
I'm arguing it's not a compromise without a hard cap. A hard cap of 32MB may be too high from a decentralisation point of view today, but it would eventually be overtaken by Nielsen's law, so it's not a disaster. Open-ended growth is a radical decision we don't need to take now. It also goes much further than what Gavin was proposing. It is not a compromise at all, it would mean going substantially beyond the demands of one side of the debate.

I'm not saying we should artificially limit growth for them. But do bear in mind that safe, trustless off-chain tx mechanisms are much more important for scaling Bitcoin than raising the block size limit. Also, don't forget that while the limit is somewhat artificial, so is the block subsidy.
@_date: 2015-06-13 10:02:10

True, but the nice thing is that even if the last couple of hundred meters are still run over copper, you can still get great increases over what we have today by replacing the rest with glass fiber. And that's much cheaper. This is true for both DSL and cable. You could also use high speed wireless for the last couple of hundred meters.

The part where you say 51% of hashing power can


Not whatever content. The txs have to be valid, properly signed etc, and the blocks need to conform to the 1MB blocksize. If not, existing clients will ignore them.
Miners can certainly do a hard fork that maintains continuity with the state of the ledger as it was before the fork, but it would be a new currency, a New Bitcoin. If the hard fork was uncontroversial, people would simply stop using the old Bitcoin and would simply call the New Bitcoin "Bitcoin". In the case of a controversial hard fork there might still be one winner, which would then in all likelihood inherit the name Bitcoin in popular usage. It's also possible that both would continue to exist side by side, or that both would die.
But miners cannot force a fully validating node to accept changes to the rules. Whoever installs a fully validating node gets to choose which branch of the hard fork he wants it to track.
@_date: 2015-06-07 07:22:24
There are both real similarities and important differences.
In Ripple you have IOUs that are being traded over a number of hops in a network, and IOUs themselves involve counterparty risk. Each user sets a credit limit with another user or entity such as a gateway, which determines how much in IOUs for a given counterparty you are willing to hold. In other words, you set an upper limit to the balance of your account at a gateway. This doesn't so much give you any rights, it serves to manage your exposure. You can set the limit as high as you want, though it's important to be careful as all this is debt-based.
With the Lightning Network, a payment provider would need to temporarily block an amount of Bitcoin to enable him to make future payments to you. This would again put an upper limit on your balance, but this time it actually costs the payment provider money (interest), so he'll charge a price for the service. In essence he would be doing something similar to providing *you* credit, though without any risk to the provider.
This is the opposite of what happens with Ripple, because there the limit specifies how much trade credit you extend the gateway, not how much credit it extends to you. In the LN the limit does not exist to limit your exposure as Bitcoin is not an IOU and holding it does not involve counterparty risk. Instead it is a technical limit that is required to allow you to receive payments up to that amount.
If you wanted to, you could probably also implement something like Ripple IOUs in Bitcoin with LN + coloured coins.

It's not an IOU because there is no counterparty risk.

@_date: 2015-06-28 08:53:09
I believe the idea is as follows. Maybe and others can chime in to make corrections.
The network needs to broadcast both transactions and blocks, but the blocks consist mostly of transactions, which results in the transactions being broadcast twice, which is inefficient.
To make this more efficient, you could broadcast a compressed version of the block, with the individual txs of many hundreds of bytes replaced by their 32 byte txid. Any node that receives such a block and already has the transactions can reconstruct the block from that information.
Rusty's method (which have have been introduced by adds some further optimisations, reducing the encoding to just two bytes per tx. This involves calculating additional hashes of the txs, and for that application it's not necessary to use expensive cryptographic hashes. Cheaper hashes like Murmur can be used instead.
@_date: 2015-06-07 07:50:06
The exit nodes don't need to be Bitcoin relay nodes, but if Bitcoin traffic starts overwhelming the Tor network, I imagine exit nodes will start changing their exit policies. A  Bitcoin relay node that was able to defray its costs through micropayment channels could sponsor dedicated exit nodes.
You're right that anonymity may already be in trouble, even over Tor.
@_date: 2015-06-13 06:38:50
I'm worried about too large blocks, but not because I want to create fee pressure or maximise miner's income. I'm not sure miners will vote for small blocks, since they may feel that that severely limits the value of Bitcoin. I can live with an increase, but I'm very unhappy about giving all power to decide to the miners. Indirectly users still have influence of course, since they can abandon Bitcoin, but that's not very helpful if you don't want to do that.
I'm especially unhappy that there's no guarantee most people will continue to be able to run a fully validating node at home.
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:35:25
If there's a split, it's much better if Bitcoin core remains the digital gold layer on top of which an XT layer can operate. 20MB proponents could get what they want without damaging the goals of those who want to stick with 1MB for now.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:54:04
If you wanted that, you could go that low, but there's no need to. 1MB is small enough to allow massively decentralised nodes in people's homes. How useful that is is a different question, but do you disagree 1MB is small enough to allow this to happen?

@_date: 2015-06-13 07:08:25
The concern that blocks will grow too fast is based on a concern for *safety*, specifically a fear that Bitcoin will not remain decentralised if the ordinary user cannot choose to run a fully validating node at home. The maximum limit that is still safe is a function of technology, not of demand. As put it the other day:


Conversely, those who are afraid that a limit that is set too low will hinder the growth of Bitcoin want to to set a safe minimum size. They might be happy with a dynamic schedule influenced by demand.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:05:14
No one is saying 1MB is optimal, just that we know 1MB is safe. It's also safe to assume Nielsen's law will continue to hold for at least a couple of years.

Somewhat cleaner, not much cleaner.


A soft fork can be rolled out more quickly, which is nice for those who fear an increase is urgent. A hard fork for 2-4-8 could technically be rolled out faster too, but getting everyone to upgrade would take a bit longer, unless there is great urgency, and I don't think there is.
Both a variant of 2-4-8 and SW should be deployed next year. The fastest and most flexible way to go about it would be with a hard fork for 2-4-8 and a soft fork for SW, in either order, though the soft fork is more likely to go first.

Why would a miner want to vary size based on anything else than tx fees, provided it stays below the hard limit?
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:33:40
Of course, I meant that the complexity will not be on the consensus code side, so it's not an obstacle to rolling this out quickly. Adam has said his proposal could be rolled out on the same schedule as Gavin's. Without GUI changes people would not be able to take advantage of it immediately, but they wouldn't have to because of the ability to change the layer-0 block size to 32 MB through on-blockchain voting by miners.

Do the math. How much bandwidth do you think is needed for 7B people making even only one tx a day? How much does bandwidth cost today per GB?

Yes, obviously. Higher prices don't cause the block size limit to be raised, they push out lower-value txs.
@_date: 2015-06-07 14:20:31
It doesn't cost a whole lot of money for a sender, since he would not have to pay any tx fees.
It's good that people are working on the block propagation issue. Let's solve that first and let's wait for some evidence that we actually need to make a change soon. Similarly, let's get checklocktimeverify adopted so the LN people can do their thing. Let's make the Core client more robust so it won't thrash / crash as the mempool fills up.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:35:35

It makes very little difference to me if the split is planned in 2016, we'd be locking the decision in now, while I want to keep the decision open because the decision itself involves risks too.

Very well, let me rephrase it then. Bitcoin-style flooding networks can operate in a decentralised fashion with 1MB blocks. Of course there are still concerns about the increasing centralisation of mining, but I'm talking about network capacity here.
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:42:35
Check Adam Back's thread.
My understanding is that with a layer-1 client you can move funds between the two layers, or within either layer. With a layer-0 client you can only transact on layer-0.
Layer-0 would be a super-secure settlement layer. People could choose to do transactions on it, but it would likely cost more. Those who would rather have cheap transactions would tend to use layer-1. Both layers would use the same currency, and funds could be transferred 1:1, tx fees aside.
@_date: 2015-06-07 10:03:21
Nope, bandwidth for an individual user scales linearly, but that means total bandwidth scales quadratically, unless fewer and fewer people run a full node, in other words, more centralisation.
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:30:46
I thought it would be more useful if people could respond to the different points independently. I'll not make many more separate posts, but are you sure this is what you want?

Many? Who are these mysterious 1MB forever proponents? I don't think I have seen any,  let alone many.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:48:46
Not only that, we know that the bandwidth requirements for 1MB blocks are low.
@_date: 2015-06-29 07:09:44
You say you want both decentralisation and low fees. With the current state of the Bitcoin software and the current state of networking technology you can only have both if you serve only a relatively small group of users.
If you want Bitcoin to stay decentralised you'll need some sort of cap. We can debate how high it should be, but there will have to be one. Also note that the size of the cap is determined by technological factors and not by demand.
You could also reduce decentralisation a bit, or even a lot. I think that defeats the whole purpose of Bitcoin, but many here think it's a good idea.
@_date: 2015-06-07 08:20:05
Interesting remarks, but I'm not sure that we absolutely need bigger blocks. With *tree* chains rather than just *side* chains 1MB might be good enough indefinitely, though there might not be pressing reasons to keep it that small.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:21:14
Could you elaborate on that? What evidence suggests 1MB is too much? What will 0.12 do that would help?

@_date: 2015-06-27 10:42:14




No, quite the opposite. I'm saying you can count on them trying to do just that, if they have to. But they may not have to if we abandon the path of decentralisation. In that case they can simply coopt the system through blacklisting if it even survives its inefficiency compared to traditional banking systems.
@_date: 2015-06-09 06:55:39
It's not meant to be superior, it's meant to be an acceptable coping mechanism and will likely be needed eventually anyway. Some people believe there are reasons related to decentralisation that require us to keep blocks small for now. As technology progresses these will become less important. The fees argument is meant to demonstrate we can afford to wait.

Yes, which is why I would want to impose a hard 32 MB super cap on this, and limits on yearly growth.

What makes you say a LN hub would know?
@_date: 2015-12-13 14:10:26
A factor of 0.1 for Thin Blocks is too optimistic. You still need to transfer all individual transactions, you just don't have to transfer them twice, once as a transaction and once as part of a block. That gives a factor of 0.5 at best. If you factor in the need to relay to a couple of peers it gets worse. Also, Matt Corallo's optimised Relay Network for miners does something similar already.
EDIT: you have to look at propagation delay and bandwidth separately. A compression scheme could still give better than 0.5 on delay (which is why IBLT is interesting), but not on bandwidth. But it's going to to require something fancy like IBLT to improve on the Relay Network.
@_date: 2015-12-26 20:42:42


LN is trustless, so this makes no sense.

@_date: 2015-12-19 20:18:38
Thanks, that's interesting information. It looks as if supporting key recovery soon would not hurt us, since having a new payment type available doesn't require people to keep using it forever or exclusively. CPU cost can also always be taken into account in block creation policy and future validation cost metrics.
@_date: 2015-12-22 14:56:48


But that specific point applies more to contentious hard forks, doesn't it?

Which is another way of saying it's a hard cap. And note that I'm not saying the 32MB cap should stay forever, just that it exists. You on the other hand were claiming there was no effective cap.


You can do whatever you want.
@_date: 2015-06-20 08:18:16
Yes, but that would likely lead to a centralised system which still isn't price competitive with existing systems because of the mining costs.

And yet you were predicting the number of nodes would rise.
@_date: 2015-06-09 05:29:50
No, the question is not whether we should increase the block size limit. Nearly everyone agrees we will need to do so eventually. The dispute is over when to do it and by how much and whether to do it without near consensus or not.
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:35:16
I picked Napster as an example precisely because it was centralised and therefore vulnerable.
File sharing isn't a threat to governments, just to campaign contributors, and to a degree governments are willing to repress it even against the will of the people. As a result of even such limited repression there are no companies that can share files openly without getting taken down soon.
Imagine what would happen if Bitcoin became a real threat to governments by seeing widespread adoption. They would first try to coopt it and then try to repress it. Bitcoin can only escape being coopted if it is able to withstand much stronger repression than that which has been used against file sharing services.
@_date: 2015-06-27 10:37:10
Could be, but I don't think that will be enough if Bitcoin gains mass adoption without being coopted by governments through blacklists etc.
Governments don't clamp down on Bitcoin yet because it's too much of a hassle. It's only a nuisance, not a real threat yet and it's difficult to stamp out. In addition they can still try to coopt it.
But they'll come down on it like a ton of bricks if it ever becomes a real threat. The interesting thing is what will happen then. What will happen if Open Bazaar is wildly successful and is used on a large scale for both legal and illegal purposes? When payment channels are used to pay for illegal downloads? When people crowd-source leaks of secret government documents? When the ability of central banks to conduct monetary policy is threatened, when the tax man has difficulty collecting taxes? When prediction markets take off?

I'm not saying this couldn't happen eventually, but it will still be far less than is needed to download all txs in a 7B user economy even if each user makes only one tx a day. Maybe such a model could be workable, but it will involve a lot of off-chain txs.
@_date: 2015-06-09 06:45:40
Lightning isn't an alternative system at all, it is layered on top of Bitcoin itself. All LN txs are actual Bitcoin txs and can be broadcast to the network at any time. In fact that's how it can be trustless and that's why it doesn't have its own currency.
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:42:39
Ah, OK.
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:51:53
I agree that their hashing power is important tactically, in the short term. What I meant is that in the longer term the distribution of the hashing power would respond to changing mining economics such as a shift in the relative importance of power and bandwidth.
@_date: 2015-12-21 11:58:28

@_date: 2015-12-22 11:23:50


They will degrade to SPV-level security until they upgrade, which is not something XT proponents can complain about since they'd reduce most people to SPV status eventually. Furthermore, as long as they don't upgrade they aren't forked off the network as would be the case with a hard fork.

There was a double spend during the LevelDB fork. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:01:27
In my opinion things like LN and sidechains / treechains are the solution. I also believe that we have plenty of time and that there is no need to rush into anything.
However, many voices call for an increase, and as long as there is a safe hard cap (20/32 MB) I can live with it, especially since network technology will continue to improve for the foreseeable future.
Using a voting mechanism gives a more controlled way to change the limit than Gavin's contentious hard fork proposal.
Adding in Adam's extension blocks proposal could help get a bigger consensus and relieve pressure for further layer-0 increases. 20MB proponents already tell us they think it buys us enough time to develop off-chain solutions or other layered systems. It is also a step towards a layered system, and I believe that's what's needed to deal with both sides' concerns.
@_date: 2015-06-14 14:21:31
Yes it is, it is what determines how decentralised the network will be. Maybe you think there will be no grave harm to decentralisation, or maybe you don't care about it very strongly, but to deny it is a huge influence is disingenuous.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:51:23
Miners who observe the layer-1 ledger may still decide whether to block a transaction in layer-0. If they are in a majority then it's still a soft fork.

@_date: 2015-06-16 21:24:44


I don't understand what you're trying to say.
I was trying to say people would only run a 1MB network if they had some reason for it, and that wanting a global payment network couldn't be enough of a reason for it, because it would not in fact be capable of acting as a global payment network. If people misguidedly believed it could and tried to run it that way, they'd eventually discover that that couldn't work.
Agreement so far?


OK, understood.
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:34:48

@_date: 2015-06-07 17:27:37
Going from ~200k blocks to ~400k blocks need not have been the reason, the availability of lightweight wallets is a very plausible culprit. We might still have lost 95% if blocks had stayed at 200k.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:36:01
The cognitive dissonance is yours. You don't understand the argument and think it is wrong because you falsely conflate off-chain with trusted. There exist trustless off-chain alternatives that are still rooted in the blockchain.

This is not a hack at all, this is a first step towards a layered solution, which is a very valuable innovation.
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:59:58
That they felt it necessary to circumvent the normal process and threaten a unilateral hard fork, against a majority of hashing power if necessary, clearly indicates the issue is contentious. The many, many threads full of heated discussion also leave no room for doubt whatsoever.
That doesn't necessarily mean they are on the wrong side of the debate, although I personally think they are, but that this is a highly contentious fork is beyond doubt.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:09:02
I agree that it might eventually. I'm not comfortable with taking that risk, especially since I believe a layered system would be superior.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:49:46
Yeah, and only with a hard cap. The increase-now camp is arguing we cannot afford to wait until the results are in because it will be too late to deploy an emergency solution. Fine, let's agree to a safe growth mechanism that is capped at 32MB. A couple of years from now the data will be in. We should not allow ourselves to be bounced into open-ended increases under the pretext of a precautionary principle.
If they can't agree to a reasonable hard cap, then we'll know they aren't willing to compromise and want to decide the issue once and for all, despite their protestations to the contrary.

Two hard forks in 2016 is far too much to ask for and most of the improvements you listed do not require one. My own preference for a compromise hard fork would be early 2017, but people are telling me that too is too soon and we may need as much as 2 years lead time. And we can only schedule a hard fork if we know there is an overwhelming consensus, so 3 years is more realistic.

As long as people keep misconstruing and misusing that quote I'll keep pointing that out.

Evidence that larger blocks are better for the average person in the short term. I'd believe that if they had difficulty getting real payments onto the blockchain at reasonable prices.
My expectation is that rising fees will be enough in the short term and will accelerate development of the LN. If not, we can always use a block size increase as a fallback. 2MB is probably safe, and even 20MB might be.
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:27:18

@_date: 2015-06-01 21:08:49
Off-chain does not imply hosted wallet. If it did, then you'd have a good point. The Lightning Network is based on actual Bitcoin txs that can be broadcast to the blockchain at any point if the counterparty refuses to cooperate. And because both parties know this, most of the txs can be kept off the blockchain. Not only does this reduce the load on the blockchain it can also help you get more privacy.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:23:21
I didn't say there was a magical constant, or that I know what it is. I'm only saying that 1MB is known to be inside the safe zone from that point of view. We also know it's not enough to make Bitcoin a world currency.

This might be true, but it's not obvious. Is it more useful for the first other miner to receive your block, or for the average miner, or for the last one to receive it? And might it not be more important for every miner to receive it more or less simultaneously?

No, you misunderstand what opt-in means, which may mean the name should have been chosen better. Opt-in in this context means that an opt-in-compliant miner will never replace a transaction that doesn't have the flag set. The transaction's sender needs to opt in to replacement and make it visible in the transaction itself in order to make the transaction eligible for replacement. This is independent of whether the Core wallet sets the flag by default, or even allows you to set it at all.
Opt-in means miners check the flag, not that wallets can't set it automatically.

It's not just the bandwidth, it's the block propagation delay too. According to Peter Todd this skews the incentives towards larger pools. I don't understand the full argument though, since if you don't mine while you are downloading a block, your power consumption is proportionally lower too.

No it wouldn't. Off-chain doesn't mean centralised and censorship-prone. If trusted off-chain txs were the only alternative I'd agree with you, but they aren't. Lightning Network will be trustless, based on actual Bitcoin txs that can be broadcast to the blockchain to enforce execution in case of a dispute.
Increasing the block size is only a temporary solution, we cannot scale the blockchain to the point where it serves 7B people without either losing decentralisation or moving most transactions off-chain. Do the math. How many people do you think would be able to run a full node if 7B people made one tx a day?
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:29:34
The block size limit isn't currently artificially constraining adoption, since it is more than counteracted by the block subsidy, which makes txs unrealistically cheap.
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:56:19
If each of N users makes k transactions each day, then that means k * N transactions. If each of these N users downloads all of these transactions, then that means the required total worldwide bandwidth scales as k * N * N = k * N^2.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:10:24
That's what I thought too, but then someone pointed out that only the node running the pool software needed to have good bandwidth, the hashing farms don't. I'd expect hashing farms to stay in places with cheap electricity while their full nodes move to places with good bandwidth.
Then again, surely the Chinese miners have thought about this too, so maybe I'm missing something.
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:07:29
I think I've seen it before and IIRC he is saying that because we don't know the identity of miners, we can't know how decentralised we are and that is dangerous. I don't see how it relates to 8MB blocks though.
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:05:43


Yeah, I was about to mention that. It does appear to shift the balance of power, because if this checks out it allows arbitrary changes in block size without the full risks associated with a hard fork. Of course, people could soft-fork back to a stricter interpretation. We live in interesting times.

At least people wouldn't lose money, they'd notice that their client is no longer working, complain on some forum and find out they need to upgrade. Not as nasty as a hard fork, but not as nice as an ordinary soft fork either.

You should have code named your stress test "Hammer Down". Because then we'd have an excuse to say "Hammer Down is in effect". And we'd get to deploy green flares on the roof if we were still combat effective. We could live-stream it on Streamium for good measure. Maybe next time?

Without a new fixed hard cap this proposal is even more radical than the 20MB proposal and I wouldn't support it.
I can see the appeal of a mechanism that allows for controlled upgrades, but I don't want to give miners unrestricted freedom to decide a new cap. I'd like to limit the increase factor, the number of upgrades that may be performed under this new authority before it expires, a sunset date and a hard absolute cap of 32 MB, which happens to be the original limit.
@_date: 2015-12-30 11:09:51
That looks very interesting. But is effectively blocking old clients from seeing transactions really safe? After all, such transactions are still confirmed on the new chain. A person might try to send a similar transaction several times, perhaps with increasing fees in an attempt to get it to confirm and end up paying someone several times.
Maybe we could require the tx version number to be increased as well so transactions sent from old clients would never confirm? Perhaps the code already includes this idea, I need to look at it more closely.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:02:07
That's more or less what I'm proposing.
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:45:53

@_date: 2015-06-06 10:55:14
We know that quadratically scaling broadcast-based 1MB-block Bitcoin as it exists today can operate in a decentralised way. That is enough to provide a trustless digital gold, and a base ledger on top of which you can layer additional chains and other services. This is something very valuable, and should not be risked in order to accommodate higher transaction volumes. The proper place for blockchains with larger blocks is on top of the existing 1MB chain. There's no need to sacrifice one use case for another, we can have both, just not both in the base chain.
That's not to say the 1MB cannot rise eventually, as long as it stays at a size that is compatible with decentralised operation.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:37:37
Yeah, much better to put it in a public blockchain that *anyone* can see.
@_date: 2015-06-27 12:02:39
Nobody is crippling Bitcoin, this is how it has worked for years. You can build other, still trustless systems on top of Bitcoin. Don't spoil the party for those who care about the original cypherpunk ideals.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:29:40
It's conceivable that one day everyone will have 1Tb/s connections and Bitcoin will serve 10B users without the need for off-chain txs or systems layered on top of Bitcoin. However, it's by no means certain that this will happen or that it would be the best way to do it even if it is possible.
In addition, it is likely that there will be long periods during which Bitcoin will need a large percentage of off-chain txs, which I hasten to add can still be trustless.
Simply counting on increasing the block size limit is very dangerous even from the point of view of wanting to scale, let alone while wanting to preserve decentralisation in the process.
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:10:04
Depends on your definition of sensible. I think most people would be satisfied with some form of 2-4-8, though not necessarily if it's only activated by February 2017 as I was proposing. I think 2-4-8 by then is unnecessary, but also something we could afford to do anyway. If that was a compromise everyone could get behind, I'd support it too. But unfortunately it looks as if that's still too soon for Core and not soon enough for the other side. And if it's not a compromise, it will not heal the rift and will make things worse, not better.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:37:37
~~What's 2wp?~~ Never mind, you probably mean two way peg. In that case how could there possibly be radically different prices on the main and side chain?
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:59:20
If we're talking about the classical Bitcoin flooding consensus model, then n users means n fully validating nodes. Assuming each user makes roughly k txs a day, the required size of blocks is O(n). And since each node downloads the full blockchain that gives you O(n) * O(n) = O( n^2 ).
This model can't scale indefinitely. Either we lose some degree of decentralisation, or we move most txs off-chain.
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:11:20
Unless something like tree chains works out, I don't think 1MB will be enough forever. I do think we need some sort of fixed cap.
Arguing and planning is what we are doing now, Gavin's proposal goes beyond that.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:03:33
There aren't any trustless off-chain solutions yet, just as we haven't hit the block size barrier yet.
No bad and irreversible things will happen if we hit it before LN arrives, it just means that the more frivolous transactions will be pushed off the blockchain, onto trusted systems that already exist. While that is not ideal, it preserves the decentralised, censorship-resistant nature of the blockchain, which is very valuable. Eventually LN will arrive and then transactions can move to it.
If you don't believe that, then I'd like to hear why not since LN transactions are sets of actual Bitcoin transactions that can be broadcast onto the blockchain if a counterparty does not cooperate. And if something like LN does not work, then the centralised nature of Bitcoinis doomed anyway.
Should bad things happen anyway, then we can always fall back on a block size increase. The BDB fork shows a change can be rolled out quickly in an emergency.
And the optimistic scenario (and still realistic) is that LN arrives before the block size barrier is hit, and then we may not need a block size increase at all.
I'm not against a block size increase eventually, but I want to see the evidence of rising tx fees first before we rush into something irreversible. The bandwidth available to the network will continue to grow, though more slowly than Moore's law, and the block size can grow along with it if necessary. This applies to both Tor and the open internet.
@_date: 2015-06-13 12:08:54
Interesting, but I don't think it takes either bandwidth costs for miners or propagation delay into account.
@_date: 2015-06-07 10:53:11
Governments could force nodes in data centers to comply with blacklisting because they can force data centers to take down nodes that don't, just as we've seen with file sharing sites. Tor might offer a way out, but only if the Tor network can handle the massive volumes required, which looks problematic.

Yeah, all the morons coming out of the woodwork show us why we need a currency governed by mathematics, not by the whims of stupid and greedy people.
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:46:13
Exactly, but 6000 full nodes isn't nearly enough either. If governments truly wanted to crack down on Bitcoin, you'd need millions of full nodes and miners running as Tor hidden services or I2P nodes. After all, the Bitcoin network broadcasts the addresses of full nodes, and those had better not be clearnet addresses or governments could simply round them up.
The ability to withstand such repression is best used as a deterrent: if it were clear to all involved that Bitcoin could survive such an onslaught, then governments would stop trying.
@_date: 2015-06-07 11:08:52
Well, I'd say that if you're not running a full node then you might be a hasher, but not a miner. I'm not sure about the pools argument, because governments could coerce pools into going along with blacklisting. It might be enough to protect you against rogue pools, but not against rogue governments.
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:10:54
Bitcoin cannot remain decentralised with unlimited block sizes, so that argument fails. In addition, IOUs are neither the only nor the best systems to layer on top of a base ledger. LN for instance is trustless. It is precisely concerns about the risk of further recentralisation that drive opposition to an increase in the limit.
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:28:44

It can certainly be merged soon, which is what I'd like to see. But *activating* a hard fork at short notice is dangerous unless there is great urgency, because otherwise it will be hard to get everyone to upgrade in time.
Soft forks on the other can be safely activated at short notice, though depending on their complexity merging may take longer. For instance something like BIP202 could be merged in January and safely activated next December, while SW could only be deployed in Q2 but activated soon afterwards.
@_date: 2015-12-28 13:25:17


It's certainly more complicated, so it would take longer to merge. But since it's a soft fork it can be deployed quicker and more safely. A hard fork could take a year to do safely, maybe more.

Yeah, but this is something that Adam Back's extension blocks could solve. I think we really need to move to some sort of layered system that addresses both parties' concerns. Jeff's proposal as it is doesn't do that, it simply leaves the decision to a majority vote by miners, which may result in a solution nobody likes.
By the way, did you get my DM?
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:26:09

@_date: 2015-06-15 05:35:49
Same applies to miners of course, but I agree. The whole voting business seems fundamentally at odds with the Bitcoin ethos. A vote on the block size may turn out to be the Trojan horse that destroys Bitcoin. Before you know it we'll have votes on all sorts of things, maybe the 21M cap, minimum fees, suspicious transactions, confiscating wealth, taxes etc etc. Bitcoin was intended to be governed by clear and objective mathematical rules, not by mob rule.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:01:31
Yes, if that's what the miners want. Conversely, there is no guarantee that the miners will keep the blocks small enough that most people can choose to run a fully validating node at home. That's giving the miners a lot of power and nobody else in the eco-system would have a direct say. It isn't even really decided by a supermajority of miners, since a simple majority can censor the votes of the minority.
Changing something as essential as the block size without pre-set hard bounds is like a constitutional amendment and should require a supermajority.
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:05:12
Plain and simple, ordinary English usage. Without a hard cap you won't get a compromise that nearly everyone will support. There will be a lot of acrimony in the community, the core devs will not support it.
@_date: 2015-06-07 10:29:22
In fact it's people who blindly call for increasing the block size and call everybody who has reservations stupid or dishonest that are being pig-headed idiots. There are valid concerns on both sides of the debate, and I see thoughtful contributions being made on both sides.
I happen to believe Gavin is wrong on this one, but clearly he isn't stupid or ignorant. I'm having a friendly conversation with Edmund Edgar, who is in favour of an increase right about now, and who I consider intelligent, informed and honest.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:15:17
Not everybody needs to run a full node, but as fewer and fewer do, the network becomes more and more centralised. Quadratic scaling puts enormous pressure on people not to run a full node.

You're still showing the misleading figure for thin blocks. Propagation delay is something that only affects miners, not non-mining full nodes. And miners today are connected by the Relay Network, which uses a more advanced form of thin blocks already. Adding thin blocks to the network protocol will give zero improvement over that. It will still make it cheaper to run a full node, which is good, but that's not the bottleneck right now.

Turns out that's only a temporary solution though, since it's not completely efficient.
From the [BIP]( for Segregated Witness addresses:
*As the P2SH address has been defined in 2012, using witness program in P2SH allows most existing wallets to pay a segwit-compatible wallet without any upgrade. However, this method requires more block space and is less collision-resistance than a native witness program, and is only a short-term solution to make the transition smoother. Eventually, all users are expected to use the more efficient native witness program as the primary payment method.*

Where did you get that number?
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:27:10
I don't like dynamic limits, because as points out (decentralisation) safety has no direct relationship with demand. Within the limits that allow safe operations market forces should determine the size of the blocks.
From things like Nielsen's law we can reasonably extrapolate how the safe limits will grow for the next five to ten years, so the limit can be time-variable, but independent of volume.
The only reason we would allow miners a voice at all is as a compromise with those who are less concerned with decentralisation than with growth. Their concern for growth could be dealt with as evidence for it appeared in actual volumes. Rules based on volume could then provide an additional check / balance, so miners could only raise the limit if blocks started filling up or lower it if they started getting empty.

The 1MB was one guess at that safe limit, made several years ago. Bandwidth has improved since then, so whatever was the real safe limit back then could be increased now.
I don't believe it's correct to say that the reasons for the cap are invalid, just that it may have been too low (or too high) and technology has improved since then.

I wouldn't be surprised if governments all over the world tried to classify both miners and LN node operators as money transmitters. Tracking down LN nodes might be difficult though. Controlling the sale of mining hardware is a different matter.

One potential problem would be that without additional paid-for exit nodes willing to relay to Bitcoin nodes we'd quickly exhaust the capacity of the Tor network.
I'm also worried that as blocks grow it would become more difficult to stay anonymous, even behind Tor.
@_date: 2015-06-20 07:16:40
No one is saying it is enough.
As for math, let's do the math the other way round. 12GB per block for 7B tx/day won't be acceptable any time soon. The block size can grow beyond 1MB, and probably beyond 32MB eventually, but it will be a long time before 12GB blocks are acceptable, if ever.
 What utility Bitcoin has today is because of its decentralisation. There is a wide gap between what a quadratically scaling decentralised flooding network can support and the needs of a global payment mechanism. We need more than just the traditional Bitcoin mechanisms to help bridge that chasm. The solution is not to destroy what we have today by stressing the system beyond its safe limits. The solution is to develop additional systems and technologies.
Progress in networking technology on the one hand and off-chain yet untrusted solutions like LN can help and additional mechanisms may also be needed.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:31:08
Other than giving miners too much power I think introducing voting into Bitcoin is dangerous. If it is what it takes to avert a possibly disastrous hard fork, then it is acceptable as a temporary solution, but I'd like to add further checks and balances.

As points out [here]( the cap should be based on what is *safe*, not on demand. As long as we stay inside the bounds of what's safe, market forces should set the block size limit.
@_date: 2015-12-24 11:20:34
Miners and relay node operators set their fee levels or don't bother to and use the default, which is also a choice. So it is in fact a supply/demand scenario. As fees rise, people will start paying more attention and the market mechanism will become more sophisticated. Right now it isn't because right now it doesn't need to be. Yet another example of market forces in action!

It's not safe to continue that indefinitely as we don't know what will happen to network technology in the long run. We can't just count on bandwidth increasing by 50% every two years indefinitely.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:46:24
The model I'm aiming for is one of deterrence and divide and conquer: have a black market that can withstand coordinated attack and "substantial noninfringing use" to provide both cover and political support.
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:36:37
Well, that's much more than I have available at home. But the bigger problem is that Bitcoin couldn't operate in a very decentralised way anymore, because if each user's bandwidth requirements grow linearly, the total bandwidth requirements grow quadratically. If tx numbers keep rising, then at some point only a tiny fraction of people will be running fully validating nodes.
I fear that that will have disastrous consequences for censorship-resistance. The reason governments haven't really tried to destroy Bitcoin is because they realise it is decentralised. Otherwise it would have sufered the same fat as Napster or E-gold.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:59:26
But that is true even with a bigger block size. We can't keep raising the block size limit indefinitely without losing decentralisation at some point, we need both off-chain txs and fees to relieve the load on the blockchain. Maybe we need other things as well.
@_date: 2015-06-20 08:17:19
Wanting to store all coffee purchases in an immutable ledger forever. We want those transactions to be done in Bitcoin, and we want them to be trustless, but they cannot all be stored in the blockchain, nor should they.
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:28:46
There is no magical maximal block size that is required to stay within the spirit of Bitcoin. But staying within the spirit of Bitcoin does require a dense and distributed broadcast network of validators and at any given moment in time networking technology puts limits on the maximum block size such a network can support. There is no doubt that the block size can be allowed to increase several orders of magnitude over time, it's just the timing and the timing mechanism that is controversial.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:21:00
The percentage of the user base that is able to run a fully validating node behind Tor on their standard internet connection is a metric I consider important. It doesn't mean they all have to actually run such a node, just that they're able to.

I wonder whether Mike and Gavin actually prefer a hard fork in order to make sure the miners don't have a veto.
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:23:17
We can hold that option in reserve until we see actual evidence of a problem, such as tx fees rising for actual payment txs which are only a fraction of the total amount of txs. We still have a lot of spam, frivolous txs and implicitly subsidised altcoins that use Bitcoin as a base ledger.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:23:32
No, I meant blacklisting tainted coins. Governments could easily maintain taint registers in their jurisdictions, that's what I meant by blacklisting. I hear there's a difference between redlisting and blacklisting, but I don't know the details, so perhaps I'm using the wrong term.

An interesting twist on this is that you could route it through a social graph of P2P connections. It would be similar to Ripple / Ripple classic, though with important differences. in particular it would be trustless, involve no counterparty risk and would be more private than Ripple.

Note that I have no problem with having the block size scale with advances in networking technology, or even modest extrapolation from Nielsen's law. That seems highly desirable. I just don't like the idea of abolishing the limit altogether or setting in stone 20 years of doubling the limit every other year. And I especially don't like the idea of being bounced into such a reckless move under the pretext that it's too risky to wait and see what happens.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:52:57
It might, but there's no guarantee it will. What matters to me is whether we can have a healthy network of full nodes run from people's homes. Eventually that could well be the case even with much bigger blocks than today.

Various reasons. First of all, we don't know exactly what the safe limit is. Safety is also not the only consideration, and some care more about growth than about decentralisation.

OK, now I'm curious.
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:08:13


This misses the point. The real concerns are censorship resistance and the ability to personally validate all your transactions. Censorship resistance requires miners (and pools) to be able to evade detection by governments, which is much harder if you run your node in a data center. The ability to check all your transactions yourself also requires you to be able to run a full node at home, where you have full control over it.
@_date: 2015-12-30 12:52:52

SW only allows for very modest growth. Good enough for the near future, but not enough eventually. Extension blocks could allow further growth without needing a hard fork. I'm undecided whether we should try to avoid hard forks for scaling in the long run.
@_date: 2015-06-07 11:32:36
I'm not totally convinced, but that's a good point. It does presuppose widely distributed hashing power, which isn't true today, which is worrisome in itself.
@_date: 2015-06-21 08:49:22
It could also work in a way that's similar to Ripple Classic. LN has the added advantage of requiring much less trust in the counterparties. The worst they can do is to delay the release of funds, they cannot seize / lose them.

@_date: 2015-06-13 07:36:41
I agree completely, but from the perspective of those who worry that the limit will limit the growth of Bitcoin, there does need to be some guaranteed growth within the safe limit.
Gavin's original proposal clearly had that and at least it also had a hard cap. If these were the only two proposals, then I'd go with Gavin's, much as I dislike it.
I'm particularly worried that under Jeff's proposal there is no longer any guarantee that running a fully validating node at home will always be possible for the average consumer. Allowing such a change with a simple majority of miners is like scrapping an article of the constitution and allowing one house of parliament to set the rules in future with a simple majority vote.
Gavin's proposal only buys us time and isn't a complete solution, but buying time may be all we can do. I think we can do much better than Gavin's proposal however, and incorporating elements from Jeff's and Adam's proposals seems the way to go to me.

No, the strength of Bitcoin lies in its decentralisation. This is important for survival as the different fates of Napster (centralised) vs Bittorrent (decentralised) show. It is crucial that Bitcoin should not lose its decentralised nature.

What are you talking about? Fully validating nodes will reject and ignore invalid blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:57:41
In that post you take aim at views I don't subscribe to.
While I believe an immediate increase is both unnecessary and ill-advised, as long as it stays below a reasonable limit (say 32 MB) I can live with it. And since I believe a contentious hard fork is very dangerous, I'd be happy to defend this as a compromise.
I am opposed to indefinite increases or removing the limit altogether before we have much more information on adoption patterns, the effect of fee markets and the success or otherwise of off-chain systems like OT and LN. The next five years should give us enough information to make an informed decision.
I also object to misleading suggestions that there is a 1 MB brigade that obstructs all progress. It is untrue, unhelpful and disrespectful to suggest there is.
@_date: 2015-06-06 21:54:04

That will have to happen eventually anyway, even with 20MB blocks.


The 20MB will not have won, they will have got what they wanted, bigger blocks, without taking away what opponents want, an uncompromised layer-0 ledger.


They most certainly do, because the security of layer-1 depends on that of layer-0.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:14:10


I agree.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:55:32


Not for fully validating nodes, as we discussed yesterday.
Yes, we need to let go of the idea that everybody verifies all transactions, but we don't have to give up on the idea that everybody verifies *their own* transactions. In Bitcoin today you can't do that without verifying all transactions, but with separate settlement and transaction layers you could.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:54:10
I'd like to add some additional checks and balances to make sure miners do not get too much power:
- constrain the block size limit B to lie between a further upper limit U and a lower limit L defined by a band around Nielsen's law, which we assume to be likely to hold until we hit the 32MB hard super cap.
L(n) = 1.25^n U(n) = min( 8, 1.75^n )
The upper limit includes the possibility of an immediate surge to 8MB as a precaution. Obviously the constants and the precise shape of the formula could be tweaked further.
Note that the exponential growth according to a band around Nielsen's law combined with the hard 32MB cap automatically implies a sunset clause that eliminates the voting mechanism from Bitcoin once L (and consequently B) reaches 32MB.
- give users a vote too, through a mechanism similar to that proposed by - let miners increase the block size only if the median size of blocks is above 75% of the current block size limit and lower it only if it is below 25%.

I think the [Bitnodes Hardware]( would choke on such blocks. It is convenient to have some high technical limit that you know won't be exceeded so you can design hardware and software for it.
@_date: 2015-06-13 20:58:21
Hmm, I'm becoming less enthusiastic about the extension block idea as I learn more about it. I think I'd rather have a true side chain, as that avoids compromising the idea of base layer nodes being able to validate all txs in the base layer completely, without having to refer to the secondary layer.
But that may be less attractive to big block proponents as that compromises the safety of the side chain a bit compared to an extension block. Of course their own preferred course of huge blocks in a single layer is much worse, but they're too stupid to see that.
Kicking the can down the road with a controlled growth option with a hard cap of 32MB may be the best we can do now, given the irresponsible behaviour of the big block proponents. That would give us time to develop side chains, which could allow for safe experimentation with better solutions without damage to ordinary users.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:46:23
As long as there is a lower limit of 1MB and an upper limit of 32MB I'm not worried either. Others may want to see a guaranteed growth of the limit, perhaps 40% per year. As long as we stay below 32MB I can live with that too.
What I'm trying to say is that I don't want to be bounced into open-ended block sizes. Once we hit the 32MB we need to have a new debate.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:34:59
Excellent suggestion!
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:43:37
Very well, let me rephrase that: apart from a safety limit there should be no upper limit at all. And the safety limit is determined by technical factors, which change with time. It is not determined by a vote among miners.

People should realise that it is possible to have layered blockchains. Tree chains are one possibility, there may be others too. With a tree chain everybody could reasonably be a full node on each chain on the path from the root chain to the chain that holds their utxos. 1MB blocks could then be sufficient indefinitely, though it might not necessarily be optimal.

It sounds amazing, but it would actually be a soft-fork. Funds that moved from layer-0 to layer-1 would be locked in an anyone-can-spend output, but the majority of miners would ensure it would actually only move if the layer-1 ledger showed a transfer back to layer-0. Supposing that a majority of layer-0 miners decided to enforce the layer-1 rules of course.
@_date: 2015-06-13 10:52:26


I think that it's much worse than Gavin's proposal because it doesn't include a hard cap. It only constrains the rate of growth, not the eventual block size limit itself. This way we lose the guarantee that people will always be able to run a fully validating node at home.

I believe that paper disregards the very real costs of including a transaction in a block. Bandwidth costs money and the block propagation delays affects profitability.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:43:57
I don't think anyone is saying the 1MB limit should be fixed forever. Bandwidth is likely to continue to grow substantially for some time to come. If 1MB blocks are safe today from a decentralisation / censorship-resistance perspective, then 10MB blocks could be five years from now and maybe 1GB blocks ten years from now.

As I said in the comments section:
You're ignoring the huge difference between opt-in RBF, where each transaction that could be replaced by an opt-in RBF-compliant miner comes with a big fat warning flag to that effect. The change that is being merged in is opt-in RBF, not full RBF.
Also note that sequence numbers have existed in the protocol right from the beginning exactly to allow replacement of transactions. The reason it was disabled is that it's a) a DoS vector and b) not incentive-compatible. The By-Fee part of RBF fixes both problems.

I'm not so sure about that, as it's not something that's decided by a majority. Even a miner with a very small part of the hash rate can do what he wants inside his blocks. The risk will of course be smaller the smaller the percentage he controls, but it will be there at any level.

The cognitive dissonance is yours. You don't understand the argument and think it is wrong because you falsely conflate off-chain with trusted. There exist trustless off-chain alternatives that are still rooted in the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:49:35
That's not the question because Bitcoin as is cannot scale to 7B users without taking most txs off-chain. It would be nice if it could, but it can't. Quadratic scaling is a bitch.

The loan would have low *credit* risk. There would indeed be risk related to outages around expiration dates of channels. Loaning money *to* a LN hub for this purpose might indeed be risky.

Yes, (blocks of) *valid* transactions with the largest amount of PoW behind it. The *protocol* determines what is or isn't valid, not the miners.

1MB is not central planning. It would be if the aim were to pick an economically optimal size limit, but it isn't. The goal is to stay within a range that guarantees certain fundamental security assumptions. That range grows as technology progresses, currently according to Nielsen's law.
Now perhaps you disagree these security assumptions are at risk, or perhaps you think they are unnecessary, or maybe you don't share the goal they are meant to safeguard. But that doesn't make it central planning.

The developers are saying Q1 or Q2. A safe hard fork will take longer.
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:06:11
How do you think the block size should be scaled with progress in network technologies? We can be fairly certain we'll get several orders of magnitude of bandwidth increases, but it's hard to predict how long that will take. Is there any way to avoid the need for future hard forks? With automatic increases you run the risk of either going too fast or too slow.
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:52:24
It gets even messier if the majority decides to mount a 51% attack on the rival chain in order to destroy public confidence in it. I believed this has happened to SHA-256 altcoins.

I don't disagree, but modest growth to 8MB is safe, and we'll almost certainly want to do that eventually. So if it helps calm nerves, why not do it now?
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:09:03
Why aren't you willing to wait for actual evidence of these bad things? It won't come all of a sudden, we'll see tx fees rise gradually as real payment txs push out frivolous spam messages and implicitly subsidised altcoin txs.

I agree completely. But do you think 20MB is already going too far, or is that something we could still accept?

Is this a competing proposal to what Blockstream is doing for sidechains? It sounds very similar.
I would much prefer it if it was done through a soft fork. It's not clear whether he is proposing a hard fork because he isn't sure it can be done through a soft fork instead or because he actually prefers a hard fork. I asked on Twitter but didn't get a reply.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:57:10
I know, but I'm afraid if we just ignore the mob we'll end up with a potentially disastrous hard fork.
@_date: 2015-12-28 14:24:14
Well, I'm proposing we try to reach a compromise, which if accepted would by definition not be contentious. I'm much less worried about a hard fork that has broad consensus than a contentious one, although it would still need a substantially longer lead time than a soft fork. Maybe such a compromise is not possible.
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:08:42
The layered system still uses Bitcoin itself, and uses the same currency. The upper layers would allow much higher TPS than the base ledger.
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:01:30
Doesn't matter. All they can do is to create a different currency with different rules. I think you need to read up on how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:41:46
Which is what LN on top of Bitcoin would offer, unlike Bitcoin with gigantic blocks as you are advocating.
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:22:49
Which is as it should be. Bitcoin is governed by dispassionate algorithms, not by mob rule. If you don't like the rules, fork the code and start a new network.

OK. 1% of 7B is 70M or about 4x the population of the Netherlands, where I live...
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:57:06
I'm more concerned about the number of fully validating nodes than the number of relaying nodes. Being able to verify your own txs is an important part of Bitcoin's system of checks and balances. The *ability* to run a fully validating node is more important than the number of nodes that actually do validate. To me that's far more important than the profitability of mining in specific locations.
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:48:01
You don't know that.
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:34:59

Thanks, generous anonymous donor!
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:32:26
So, what's your opinion of this particular proposal? I must say it's starting to look very attractive to me.
@_date: 2015-12-30 12:32:01
What should we call this new type of fork? A firm fork maybe, by analogy with software, firmware, hardware?
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:20:21
"As an experiment", I imagine.
@_date: 2015-12-27 11:44:00
It is, so adding similar capabilities to the network protocol would be good for other reasons, but it would only address something that isn't a bottleneck.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:14:25
Higher fees are not a goal, depending on exactly how much higher they are they can be an acceptable temporary effect. There is no need to restrict the block size beyond what is needed to keep the network decentralised. And as technology improves less restriction will be needed. Ideally the block size would eventually be removed entirely, or set to a very high fixed value that allows designers of nodes to figure out how much storage they need to support, with market-based mechanisms capping real block sizes to something smaller than that.
@_date: 2015-06-06 20:24:47
I think it would go a long way towards solving that. I'm not sure how it could solve the problem of maintaining censorship-resistance as the network grows.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:18:21


That's my point. My worry is that Bitcoin won't be able to resist it any more than banks or file sharing services can.


Not it isn't. Governments have no trouble at all freezing bank accounts despite the massive volumes of transactions.


Noticing isn't a consideration. Everyone is aware of governments' control over the banking system and their power to shut down file sharing services.
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:05:25


I thought onion routing was originally intended default strategy.


Same as on the blockchain, only then *everybody* knows them. Also note that neither an end user nor a payment service needs to know who the other party is.
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:25:36
I think it is important that Bitcoin is able to survive as an underground currency for the black market. That's not because I think that's a likely scenario, but it's important as a signal to would-be regulators.

Gavin does not need to step down from any official position as Bitcoin doesn't have any official positions. He's just some guy on the internet, just like you and me, only with far more *influence* than you or me.
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:28:05
It might work and some people, perhaps many, might even prefer it. But it would be a fundamental departure from Bitcoin as it exists today. Then again, such a departure is inevitable if we want to scale Bitcoin to 7B users eventually. But there's no reason to give up on the ideal of having a strongly censorship-resistant everybody-verifies-everything layer-0 that other systems and other chains or trees use for settlement.

I didn't mean that those factors weren't important, but that we're far away from the danger zone. These factors currently don't give us any reason for an increase soon. The community breaking down on the other hand worries me greatly.

@_date: 2015-06-21 12:34:44
BIP-100 is more radical than that, it also allows miners to *raise* the block size up to 32MB without requiring a hard fork and updates to all clients. I suppose you could say it is effectively a raise to 32MB combined with soft forks that enforce lower limits.
@_date: 2015-06-12 20:29:00
I don't disagree with that, but I'm concerned there is no upper limit. This is still exponential growth. With an additional 32MB hard cap I'd have no problem with such a formula, especially if it also required an on-blockchain vote by miners.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:29:38

Governments won't want to get a piece of the crypto cake if they can control it, which they can if it is centralised. Do you remember what happened to Napster and eDonkey?

Could you link to a discussion of these more serious issues, or give a brief summary?
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:43:31
I fully understand Bitcoin cannot be fully decentralised, popular and fully on-chain. In fact I've been doing my best to explain that to people. You ask, what good is Bitcoin as a money if it can't serve everyone. I ask, what good is it if it isn't decentralised? After all, we already have many centralised payments systems that are more efficient to boot. Bitcoin's value lies in its decentralised, censorship-resistant nature.
What we need to give up is not decentralisation or popularity, but the fully on-chain character. Fortunately this can be done in a trustless manner, so we can in fact almost have our cake and eat it.
@_date: 2015-06-21 07:27:06
I think a dynamic mechanism could make some sense as a check on proposed new voting powers for miners. Something like "only allow raising the limit if the median block occupancy is above 75%". It might only be a weak check though.

He is talking about the total bandwidth requirements for the whole network assuming it follows the classical flooding consensus model. Clearly something has to give eventually. It might be a radically lower fraction of people running fully validating nodes, or it might mean moving most txs off-chain, or some combination.
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:43:28
Because many people will fail to upgrade before that time. It's one of several arguments (funny that) Andresen and Hearn gave for deciding to increase soon with a one year delay (IIRC) so things would be ready before the next big run-up.

Side chains could change this. Moving coins to a side chain would be much less risky because of the 2 way peg. With side chains we could let the market settle this without a lot of drama.

Could you, as a compromise, go along with a voting mechanism a la for the *main* block chain as well, though with additional checks and balances, including a hard cap of 32MB? Provided extension blocks are part of the deal I mean.

@_date: 2015-06-01 20:53:19
That depends on whether LN arrives in time. And even if it doesn't, we'd still keep the Bitcoin blockchain decentralised, as a kind of digital gold. But I'll be much more willing to support an increase once we actually have evidence of rising tx fees for actual payments, rather than spam txs and implicitly subsidised altcoins.

That does not contradict what I said. A Bitcoin that is not radically decentralised cannot accomplish the goals of the anarcho-capitalists and cypherpunks. Don't expect them to support it, because they won't.
However, if you want them to help you find ways to scale Bitcoin without requiring them to give up on censorship-resistance, you'll find full cooperation. In fact, they are the ones leading the charge.

@_date: 2015-06-12 09:55:46
A miner or consortium of miners can create as long a chain as they wish, but it will be ignored by fully validating clients if it violates the rules. If you don't upgrade to XT and there is no consensus on a change to the protocol, then your Qt client will happily ignore the larger blocks. You will effectively have two rival Bitcoin currencies.
You appear to be confusing hard forks with soft forks. In a soft fork only a majority of the miners will decide what happens, and everybody else will automatically follow. The 20MB limit proposal would cause a hard fork.
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:11:03

@_date: 2015-12-25 12:10:57


It provides *some* value since it requires people to spend a little bit on tx fees. As long as people are adding hashes of hashes to anchor a separate chain I have no problem with it.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:48:05

If governments manage to get control over Bitcoin you can bet you will be forced to give it up.

Yes, there will have to be a path of payment channels, and yes that will tie up capital.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:11:11
Something like this:
1) R, S and T would not lock up any money, unless they want to make payments themselves. If they pay their employees and suppliers at the end of each month, they may not need to lock up any money. Coinbase on the other hand would lock up as much each merchant would expect to receive in sales over the lifetime of the channel. This is essentially a zero-risk loan, for which they would charge some low interest rate.
2) Either immediately if Coinbase agrees to such a withdrawal or at the end of the lockup period if they don't.
3) Yes, Coinbase, because otherwise they'd be giving away money.

Ehh, segregated witness has enormous benefits, regardless of whether you do it through a hard fork or a soft fork.
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:49:14
I don't think we should ignore it, but I do think it's important to realise that off-chain solutions will have to make a much bigger impact because increasing the block size alone will not come close to solving the problem.
In addition, there is no urgency for a block size increase, while keeping the block size as it is for a while reduces centralisation risks related to the block propagation delay. It also incentivises development of trustless off-chain systems that are still safely rooted in the blockchain, such as the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:57:54
I liked it initially, but it still compromises the security of base ledger coins that have moved through an extension block and back for nodes who do full validation of the base ledger only.
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:20:21
It referred to the alleged need for always-on tx signing nodes. There's no need for the tx signing nodes to be always on if you use asynchronous messaging channels like the ones I mentioned.

Because I'm worried about the size of the layer-0 chain and I don't want that to be entirely under the control of a simple majority of miners.


No, it doesn't limit the hard fork contention at all. It adds the ability to increase the hard cap without a protocol upgrade. I understand that's great for people who want such an increase, but that's precisely why it's awful for the other side.

@_date: 2015-06-07 11:01:37
Pruning only helps with storage, which isn't a real problem anyway. If you want to validate transactions you need to at least download a full copy of the blockchain, even if you don't store all of it. And you can't just verify your own transactions, you have to validate all transactions in order to verify the blocks your transactions are in are valid. Tree chains and side chains could alleviate that, but without them a node that wants to make sure its own transactions are valid has to download the entire blockchain.

Good question, and that's where the complicated dance comes in. I can't explain it here in its full glory, you'll have to consult the whitepaper and/or Rusty's blog posts on it, but it goes something like this.
Every time you make a payment through a channel, you update the balance transaction for that channel, but that isn't actually a single transaction, it's a bunch of related transactions.
Each side gets a signed transaction that once posted give the other side its money immediately while putting their own money into a temporary holding address. That holding address can be unlocked either with a separate key or by waiting a predetermined amount of time and using your own key. You invalidate an old transaction by giving the other side that unlocking key.
So if you post an older version of the balance (one in which you presumably had more money than you do now), then the other side gets his money back (under the old balance) and also gets the opportunity to take all your money.
This does mean that you have to monitor the blockchain periodically to make sure your counterparty isn't running off with the money. LN wallets will of course automate all this.

Exactly. One thing has changed though: the mining arms race has led us to a situation where ~3600 new coins are sold off each day, which puts a great deal of downward pressure on the price. I don't think it will push prices down all the way to zero, I think existing Bitcoin owners have enough faith in its future that the price will stabilise above $100. And in early 2017, when the block reward is halved things will get easier. So, no meltdown, but it will likely make a rapid new bubble much harder, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

Alice and Tom would use single-use addresses for Bob, magically derived from Bob's public master key and random numbers (nonces) generated by themselves. Every payment would use another nonce. They could even split up a payment into multiple payments, each with a separate nonce, to avoid linking different outputs in their wallet.
So Alice and Tom don't need to get their single-use addresses from Bob directly, they create them themselves and include enough information in the payment itself for Bob (but no one else) to recreate the corresponding private key. Bob has to scan the blockchain to see if he can generate the single-use private key that will unlock the output. If he can, then the payment was meant for him. If not, then it was meant for someone else, but Bob can't tell who. It could also be a non-stealth payment that happened to include a remittance advice message.
It's just the system that Satoshi recommended: use a new address for every payment you receive and make only a single payment with it. If you spend only part of it, send the change to a *new* single-use change address, not back to the sending address.
The change that stealth addresses make is that you don't have to communicate the single-use addresses out of band, it's all encoded in the blockchain in a way that cannot de deciphered by third parties as long as the relevant private keys / nonces are kept secret.

Legally, a bank is an institution that is licensed to provide credit and to use fractional reserves, and whose deposits are covered by some mandatory deposit insurance scheme. Circle and Coinbase are more similar to payment processors / money transmitters, which are typically licensed differently. They are not allowed to provide credit, their deposits aren't covered by national deposit insurance schemes and they are required to keep full reserves.
The article is right to emphasise the difference between a real wallet (where you have full control) and a managed "wallet", where someone else has control, but it's also important to know the difference between banks and payment processors.

OK, I'll pay closer attention to that then. If that's indeed what they're saying, then I disagree. We have no business artificially restricting transactions. The only reason I support a limit (for now) is because I believe it's necessary to keep the system decentralised. Extension blocks could allow both sides to have what they want, by not forcing them to have their txs cohabit in a single layer.

Yes, IOUs are debt, whether they are explicitly named as such as in Ripple, or implicitly as in a bank account or an account at a bitcoin exchange. I didn't say IOUs weren't debt, I said debt isn't the fundamental premise of Ripple. The Ripple protocol is more elaborate than the Bitcoin protocol in that it includes IOU handling inside the protocol, among other things, whereas Bitcoin (currently) does that off-blockchain.
Let's compare the whole Ripple and Bitcoin ecosystems (which are intertwined of course through Bitstamp, Kraken etc):

@_date: 2015-12-30 00:11:12
Yes, opening a channel means putting funds into a 2-of-2 multisig address. It is risky to consider the channel as active until after at least a few confirmations. But after that it's just a matter of signing new transactions that redistribute the bitcoins in that address.
Those transactions normally aren't posted to the blockchain so there's a complicated dance with revealing private keys to make sure one of the parties doesn't use an older version under which they owned more of the shared pot of gold.
Let's say you and I open a channel. We construct a transaction Ta which spends 1 bitcoin of your money and 1 of mine, we both sign it and send it to the blockchain. We also have a signed transaction T1 that refunds both of us our money, but we don't post that yet. After a few confirmations we now have a working channel. T1 essentially represents the opening balance of the channel: we both have 1 BTC.
If I now want to pay you 0.1 BTC, we both sign a new transaction T2 that spends the output of Ta into 1.1 owned by you and 0.9 owned by me. T1 has now essentially been invalidated and T2 now represents the new balance of the channel. It hasn't been posted to the blockchain and normally won't be, but it could be posted at any time as it's a perfectly legal Bitcoin transaction.
Every time we do a transaction over the channel, we both have to sign the new "balance".

Yeah, lots of Bitcoiners would like to see this happen precisely because it would be good for Bitcoin. Wikipedia is so well-known that if it were to accept Bitcoin, that by itself would be seen as a major step towards mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin.
I for one would be very eager to donate to Wikipedia if it did accept Bitcoin and I think it could bring in a lot of donations by other enthusiasts too.
And simply adding a BTC address or donation button to an existing Wikipedia page would take very little work. I think companies like Coinbase and BitPay offer (nearly?) free automatic conversion to USD for non-profit organisations.
Anyway, I don't know if it would be worth it for Wikipedia, but it can't hurt to try. On the other hand, I don't know if this is compatible with Wikimedia's stance on advertising. In Bitcoin's defence, you could say that it is a non-profit open-source movement driven by a desire for economic liberty, though the companies involved in it and many enthusiasts also hope to make a bit of money out of it.

If *all* wallets opted in by default without giving users an easy way to opt out, then that would kill zero-conf even if all miners followed opt-in RBF, FSS-RBF or simply the first-seen-rule. I find that a highly implausible scenario for reasons I described above.
A more likely scenario in my opinion is that a significant fraction of all miners adopt full RBF, which would also destroy zero-conf, regardless of what wallets do. I also don't find that scenario very plausible, unless open warfare breaks out in the ecosystem first, something I hope we can still avoid.
And should full RBF happen without open warfare breaking out first, then open warfare would certainly break out afterwards as this would likely be deadly to Coinbase and BitPay if it weren't stopped.

Yes, but you can also build in a timeout so you get your coins back if the site goes down. For that you need a presigned refund transaction from the 2-of-2 transaction that holds your funds with a time lock sufficiently far in the future. If you make a SR payment before the timeout expires, it invalidates the refund transaction, but if the timeout expires before a transaction has taken place, you can broadcast the refund transaction and it will be accepted.

From an earlier Twitter conversation I got the impression the problem is that the lawyer cannot verify the money didn't come from a drugs deal or anything. If it is paid from a bank account, then at least the authorities would have some sort of paper trail.
It would be interesting if the previous owner signed a message stating he was person so and so and made payment with hash xyz to the current owner. To prove he made the payment he could use the same public key used to make the payment. To prove he really was the person he claimed to be he could sign it with another digital signature that is generally recognised, perhaps based on a government-provided system.
You probably also want to use a timestamping service like proofofexistence.com to prove your key has not been registered as missing, but I'd have to think some more about the details.

That's a good point. You might argue that if the cosigning service is compromised, you're no worse off than with holding your own keys, but on the other hand it might lull you into a false sense of security, which is arguably worse.

1) Malleability can be accidental. The MtGox code wasn't up to date in all respects, which meant they sometimes generated nonstandard signatures, which would be normalised by the relaying nodes, thus changing the hash while keeping the signature valid and the transaction otherwise unchanged. This is what had been happening for a long time, and what had been causing Gox to lose money. At least, that's my understanding.
After the problems at MtGox were publicised there was a sudden wave of apparently deliberate malleability mutations. If this coincided with massive withdrawals, this could have led Gox to lose lots of BTC in a short period of time. Maybe they noticed they were burning through paper wallets faster than seemed possible? Or maybe they suddenly realised their cold storage procedures were affected too?
2) I'm speculating they had a read-only watching wallet with the private keys corresponding to the cold storage addresses. As it saw transactions coming in on the blockchain, it could pick those transaction outputs that corresponded to wallet addresses and store them in the wallet, just like any other wallet. If they never removed cold wallet addresses they had tried to empty from the watching wallet, it would still show those outputs that hadn't been moved.
Again, this is all speculation, but it makes some sense to me.

Yeah, if someone went out and bought some bitcoin in order to donate it to Wikimedia, that would incur fees. This is no different than using any other payment mechanism (especially credit card), and the actual fee would vary from location to location, exchange to exchange etc.
[Bitcoinaverage.com]( is a good way to monitor prices around the world. It calculates averages of a lot of exchanges all around the world and also calculates cross-rates. Right now it shows an average bid of 0.627 and ask of 0.629.
I think the main target segment would be users who are already holding BTC as an investment and are willing to give preference to merchants / charities who accept it. Personally I mostly use BTC as an investment and for donations to organisations that support BTC and liberty in general like EFF, meshnet organisations, Tor, TAILS.

I don't think proof-of-stake works as a mechanism to come to a consensus on a blockchain, but votes embedded in a blockchain secured by some other mechanism, likely proof-of-work, could work.

Yeah, unfortunate comparison, because the interesting difference between Napster and BitTorrent is centralised vs decentralised, especially in a discussion involving Bitcoin. Still, there is a sense in which it might turn out to be true: the earlier implementation may be supplanted by a superior later arrival.

However, given that Bitcoin can evolve, I'm not sure that scenario is all that likely.

It's true that bitcoins are fungible, but they are also traceable. Whenever you spend part of an output, you can trace it back to outputs you bought and figure out what price you paid for them. It's cumbersome to do this by hand, but easy enough to automate. Does this impact the LIFO / FIFO thing? You can easily have the software spit out an XML file containing all the evidence the IRS needs to verify you aren't cheating.

No, no basic misconception, I know production is kept roughly constant between halvings, I was talking about the percentage of newly mined coins that are sold. The arms race has increased costs to such a degree that many miners have to sell a large percentage of their production. In the long run, dilution has a predictable and small effect. In the short run dumping coins on exchanges creates far greater downward pressure.

If you were really ambitious you could perhaps work the MAC validation into the Bitcoin transaction itself. I'm not really sure though, and if it is possible it probably requires keeping a hash preimage secret. It would also mean non-standard scripts, but those aren't impossible to get mined.

Yes, bitcoins aren't really stored as balances in accounts, but as individual transactions that combine one or more outputs of previous transactions into one or more outputs of the new transaction.

In the new Bitcoin Core 0.9 client you can inspect the individual outputs in the wallet using the coin control functionality.

Here's a hypothesis: during transfers from cold storage MtGox swiped only a subset of tx outputs related to a given address (presumably a multisig P2SH one) due to transaction malleability.

I doubt that the percentage of mined coins sold will drop if the difficulty drops. Selling off most mined bitcoins might be here to stay. If so, it would create a permanent downward pressure. The reason I expect some sort of positive lower limit is the confidence of existing Bitcoin enthusiasts, even if the sell-offs continue.
It occurred to me yesterday that once the difficulty reaches a plateau, it will then roughly track the bitcoin price, since miners will then be turned on and off based on price and relatively stable electricity prices. And since the difficulty is only adjusted every 2016 blocks, a large drop would temporarily slow down creation and sell-off of new coins. Conversely, a large rise could temporarily raise production. In that way, maybe there would be a built-in stabilisation mechanism.
The way the various factors interact appears very complicated, and maybe we'll only understand what happened after it's all over, either because Bitcoin failed or because it established itself as a major currency.

It would be nice if we could have some sort of blockchain-based voting mechanism for these things. It wouldn't actually be real voting because it wouldn't be binding, just an opinion poll or consensus forming mechanism.
I know something similar was used for protocol upgrades, with a supermajority of blocks voting for a feature in a 2 week period or something like that. The downside of that is that it only includes the opinion of miners. We could also let every UTXO with an OP_RETURN containing the hash of a proposal count as a vote weighted with the total amount of BTC it represents. Or maybe weighted with BTC days destroyed or whatever it is that proof of stake uses.

During the transfer procedure for each address that's being emptied they need to create and sign transactions for each of the unspent outputs "stored in" that address. They could generate that set of transactions by scanning the blockchain, but that would be slow. So maybe they kept a list of tx-ids when they moved BTC into cold storage. Because of malleability, this list need not be 1-1 with the set of actual tx-ids.
Since wallets keep track of balances, this might not be noticed, since they might have thought there would be no need to reconcile the tx-ids with a table of historical transfers if you already had the outputs in a wallet.
This still needs to explain why one procedure (moving from cold storage) would use historical tx-ids, while the other (checking balances) would use a wallet containing actual and possibly mutated tx-ids. The reason might be that the checking wallet only needs read-only access and therefore only holds public keys and cannot be used for signing. It might have seemed prudent to them not to let the signing hardware touch the blockchain.
I'm not saying the hypothesis has no problems, but it seems more plausible to me than a theft.

It's also good to remember that it doesn't provide forward secrecy. Say you want to donate to Snowden or WikiLeaks, and you even discard your nonce. If the USG ever recovers the private master key from the recipient they can find out which addresses were used to send to them. That doesn't identify the sender, but it does give them a lead they can combine with KYC information gathered at exchanges around the world. And the recipient does have to keep the secret master key around or they'll lose access to new incoming payments.

I did read the article and agree with much of what he said. I think his veiled threat (as I interpret it) or mere warning (if I interpreted it incorrectly) is a good thing. We'll need better governance if Bitcoin is to continue to grow.
EDIT: of course the big question is what better form of governance, and opinions on that will likely vary. Personally I wouldn't like to see anything that gives governments any say, harms fungibility, or prevents better privacy or even total anonymity. I would like to see something that prevents miners or core devs gaining too much of a say over the future of the protocol. The current situation with the bitcoin-qt core devs being the de facto maintainers of the core protocol is something I'd like to see changed.

I 've been testing it a bit, and reported the issues I found here: 
Overall, it looks really nice and promising, but there are still some things I'm worried about. The 2/2 multisig model appears to work best for mobile payments, but in that case your 2FA is probably really only 1FA. I'd only use it for amounts you'd be willing to keep in cash. It still adds safety in the form of rate limiting, but that doesn't make much of a difference for small amounts.
On the desktop I'm worried about malicious JS. You also have to be careful not to use email as a 2FA channel if you have webmail on your PC. I don't know if there's a good way to store the nLockTime transactions safely in case your PC is compromised. And it's a trusted service anyway, as you don't have a guarantee you'll be sent the transaction if you ask for it. I'm not yet comfortable using it for the amounts of money you might have in a current or savings account.
I think you do need 2/3 multisig to deal with large amounts safely. However, it takes a lot of care on the part of the user to do that safely. Other sites offer 2/3, but not in a way that's safe for ordinary users.

Why is this being downvoted? We're talking about halving of the block reward, not the price. The reason fluctuations in hash rate play a role is because they influence the timing of the blocks. We know exactly at which block the halving of the reward will happen, but we know only roughly when that will be.
The difficulty adjustment only tries to correct the rate of creation of blocks, it doesn't try to get back on a fixed time schedule. If the hash rate increases greatly, then the next difficulty adjustment will still happen at the same block, but that block will now be created earlier than expected, shifting the whole schedule to the left.
In addition, block creation is a stochastic process, with blocks arriving once every ten minutes only on average. So even if the hash rate were absolutely constant, you could still only make stochastic predictions about when a specific block will arrive.

A generates a brand new public key K_pub for B based on B's public stealth address S_pub and a nonce N_priv. An encrypted version N_pub of the nonce is stored in the transaction. Armed with his own private stealth key S_priv and the public nonce N_pub B can recover the private key K_priv corresponding to the new address. The magic of Diffie-Hellman makes it possible for A to generate the public key K_pub based on the nonce N_priv and A's public stealth address S_pub and for B to generate the corresponding private key K_priv based on the "encrypted" nonce N_pub and B's own private stealth key S_priv.

 * App asks GreenAddress server for MAC-validated request for smartcard
 * Server does its own validation, sends request to app
 * App forwards request to smartcard and prompts user to hold NFC enabled card close to smartphone for validation on smartcard
 * Smartcard validates request with MAC, displays recipient &amp; amount on built-in display and asks for authorisation using built-in keypad (probably with PIN)
 * If user authorises, card sends authorisation with new MAC to app
 * App verifies MAC and signs Bitcoin multisig tx
 * App forwards partially signed tx + smartcard authorisation to GreenAddress server
 * Server validates authorisation and cosigns tx
 * Server broadcasts fully signed Bitcoin tx

True, but right now most transactions aren't real Bitcoin payments, but spam transactions or transactions in implicitly subsidised altcoins that merely use Bitcoin as an immutable append-only log. I expect those to be pushed out first without increasing fees for ordinary payments.
Only if adoption keeps growing and things like LN don't arrive in time will fees for real payments start to rise. When that happens, everyone will be able to see it and we'll likely have a nearly complete consensus for a block size increase.

I think this will be the beginning of some very interesting developments. We could use some sort of blockchain-based consensus measuring voting system. Something like that has been used before for protocol upgrades, with a supermajority causing the reference client to switch to the new protocol. Everybody would be free to fork if they didn't like the result, but it prevents accidents where people want to express their opinion but are still willing to follow a majority that says otherwise.
A new system would likely have to include proof-of-stake in its voting mechanism somehow, because otherwise the miners get to decide the issue unilaterally.

I think part of the reason we haven't seen a new bubble and a new ATH yet, is that something has changed, probably permanently. I think that since the ASIC revolution miners have stopped hoarding their bitcoins. This puts continuous downward pressure on the markets, but I don't think there is any need to worry about it. At some price level, probably above $100, maybe even as high as $200, existing holders of BTC will buy up all of the bitcoins that miners release onto the market. At the next halving, this would immediately create new upward pressure. In addition, it's possible that new fundamental news pushes the price up before it ever reaches its deepest support level.

Ah right, they're worried about people not being able to withdraw to the blockchain in time (before the nLockTime is reached) if a huge service were to refuse to cooperate and blocks are full. That's a valid concern, but with LN + 1MB blocks we could still scale a great deal before we got close to that point. I'm not arguing 1MB should stay forever, just that we don't need it just yet and shouldn't rush into it.
On top of that we shouldn't make controversial forks if we can avoid it, because it can lead to a disastrous schism. More constructive dialogue, less unilateralism.

As I understand it the two are combined, the extra zero BTC OP_RETURN output is enough to recover the one-time-use private key provided you also have the private master key. The one-time-use public key is a 1BitcoinAddress. It's the public master key that's special.

I'm not convinced that's true. After all, our current financial system is ubiquitous and indispensible (for now), but it isn't decentralised or censorship-resistant.


I'm not saying that a hard limit will automatically cause decentralisation, but we cannot have a system that is fully decentralised, keeps all transactions on-chain and serves the entire world economy. In addition, beyond a certain size increasing the limit would hurt censorship-resistance because of the limitations on the Tor network. That can scale eventually but not in the next couple of months to a year.

Nope, it's not an escrow at all, it's based on 2-of-2 multisig. You can always get your coins back, you may just have to wait a bit until an nLockTime is reached.
I studied mathematics &amp; computer science at university, even taught some courses there, I am a professional programmer, I have studied Bitcoin, its algorithms and the bitcoind codebase, and I have studied the Lightning Network whitepaper. I'm confident I understand how it works.
Besides, even if LN doesn't work, that still doesn't mean the alternative does. There's simply no way that a quadratic system like Bitcoin will scale to &gt;7B users without either moving most transactions off-chain or becoming centralised.

Not true, hosted wallets are not the only off-chain transactions, just the simplest ones. Things like the Lightning Network and eventually tree chains represent trustless alternatives. And because of the quadratic scaling of fully on-chain Bitcoin, we cannot have decentralised Bitcoin for &gt;7B users without moving most transactions off-chain.

Not just in high-trust environments I think. As I understand it, all you are trusting the validators you are trying to reach a consensus with for is that they won't collude against you. You are not trusting them not to forge transactions (digital signatures take care of that), not trusting them individually not to withhold transactions, you are only trusting that no 50% +1 of them will *collude* to trick you into believing a double spend. And even if they did, they would be producing cryptographically signed evidence to that effect, evidence you could share with the world. The world could then remove the offenders from their UNLs.
It still takes some trust, and there may be other things wrong with it that I'm not aware of, but that doesn't seem like a *high*-trust requirement at all.
@_date: 2015-05-31 10:00:13


I think we still have time. The BDB fork shows that a simple fix can be rolled out quickly in an emergency, when there is a clear consensus. If confirmation times and tx fees start rising measurably, everyone will see the need for larger blocks. It's possible the Lightning Network and similar systems will arrive before that time, and then it may be a long time before we need any block size increase at all, if ever.
It seems to me that rushing into an emergency solution now, when there is no emergency, is more dangerous than waiting. By all means let's be prepared, but don't do anything irreversible unless and until we have to.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:40:09
Interesting hypothesis, but you could also wonder about something similar for the people behind existing Bitcoin wallets and companies. They are offering consumer solutions centered around on-blockchain transactions that might be disrupted by something like the Lightning Network. It might be in their interest to go for a temporary fix that will allow them to continue with their existing models for a bit longer.
I don't know what the right solution is. It currently seems likely that both Lightning and bigger blocks will be part of it, but it's possible that something like tree chains will remove the need for bigger blocks.

I'm not sure, but I think wallets will generally look at the types (P2SH, SegWit, raw multisig etc) of *outputs*, not *txs*. If that's true, you should be able to see it. But I think the standardness check looks at all inputs and outputs, so you wouldn't even get that far.

We're starting to see a real divergence of interests between large commercial entities like some of the mining companies, bitpay, hosted / multisig wallet providers and more ideologically driven individual users. There isn't a huge chasm yet, and there may never be one, but it's become noticeable. I wouldn't be surprised if it were to tear the Bitcoin Foundation apart.
Figuring out a distributed governance model is going to be one of the most interesting challenges we'll face in the next few years. Ultimately it's going to be market forces that decide this, with all players having some input, but each class of stakeholders having a different form of influence.
A good distributed governance model could make this process less painful. It should provide a forum for discussion, foster consensus, prevent unintentional hard forks, but allow for deliberate secessions.

No. Bitcoin's model isn't democracy and compromise, it's individual sovereignty and code as law. This is a radical departure from traditional models, and not everybody will like it, *but we already have money controlled by democratic processes*. If you like democratic control, use fiat. If you like corporate control, use Ethereum. Both are legitimate choices, as long as they aren't forced on anybody.
Bitcoin simply is what it is, at most it can evolve by soft fork since older nodes will continue to reach consensus with newer ones. A group of people could fork away and it might even turn out that that fork is more successful and will gain a greater market cap. That's possible and that's fine, but it won't be Bitcoin.

But most of these aren't real payments, are they? If, not then price competition could drive out the more frivolous transactions. We'll still need to scale eventually, perhaps even soon, but I'm very skeptical that we're close to the point that rising tx fees would make Bitcoin unattractive as a payment system.
I'm not particularly against 20 MB blocks per se, but I'm suspicious this is being driven by ulterior motives.
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:30:18
That's basically my feeling, though eventually I'd like to move to a model where the costs of relaying txs and blocks are accounted for through micropayment channels.

I've been reading the documentation on the bitgo website, and it does seem secure provided you use 2FA. A keylogger could be used to capture a password you used to login to your bitgo account, but it wouldn't defeat 2FA and without authentication bitgo wouldn't cosign your transaction. Am I missing something?

@_date: 2015-05-24 17:48:20
I think there is a vulnerability there.
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:39:54
Having a fixed block size will eventually put a stop to this, because it will cause tx fees to rise. The question is what happens then? Do we want all payment transactions, including small ones to remain on the block chain? If so, we need to increase the block size. Or do we want most transactions to move off-chain, perhaps in a treechain, perhaps to something like the Lightning Network?
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:41:16
No, 2 dollars is clearly too much. I'm expecting near unanimity on a block size increase long before we get to that point. Rising prices are an objective piece of data that anyone can observe from the blockchain and through the confirmation of their own transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:50:49
Ripple Labs has no control whatsoever of the XRP it has released. It's also currently mainly used for spam control, with the focus being on fiat payments. It's fine if you disagree with Ripple's funding model, or if you want to compete with it, but it doesn't make Ripple centralised.
Protocol upgrades (and things like fees, minimum reserves etc) are decided by community vote, not by Ripple Labs, so you do need a 50% + 1 consensus, just as with Bitcoin.
It's fine not to like Ripple, or to want to compete with it or fork it, but don't spread misinformation about it. It is also fine to see it as a great mechanism for buying and selling bitcoin on a distributed exchange.
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:03:36
Yeah, but is that really the whole explanation? After all, they can easily provide hosted wallets too.
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:51:22
With the Lightning Network, we wouldn't need larger blocks for a long time. And even in the long run, you might still want something like tree chains with LN, and then you could do just fine even with 1MB blocks. That's not to say we shouldn't have bigger blocks ever, just that the future isn't clear and might involve all three, and perhaps new elements no one has yet thought of.
Then again, LN isn't ready yet, while larger blocks could be deployed quickly and buy us some time while LN &amp; other solutions are being developed. On the other hand, increasing the block size involves serious risks, which should make us cautious. There are risks in doing nothing too, but fortunately we have larger blocks ready as an emergency solution. The BDB fork showed us that a simple fix can be deployed quickly and will see a nearly total consensus quickly.
I think what we need is fewer people who mindlessly cheer on Gavin, and shout down dissent. Instead we need more thought and rational discussion. Most of the top experts say there are serious risks with Gavin's proposed change, we still have time to work on alternatives and we can always fall back on his proposal in an emergency.

No, that's *your* definition. That's not Bitcoin as Satoshi invented it. And since he invented it, he got to name it.

It's not just about the block size and its direct effect on decentralisation, it's also about other fundamental properties of Bitcoin: individual sovereignty, binding rules and an objective, dispassionate and impartial ledger. Once you allow emotions like wanting to save face etc play a role, once you introduce negotiations and mediators you throw all that away and Bitcoin becomes just another form of money governed by politics. Fine if people want that, but that isn't Bitcoin. It is also something that can only be done in a contentious way. The Kumbaya alternative you imagine doesn't exist.

Without a majority of miners there will be a split as soon as a miner includes a tx that spends a SegWit output in a way that is invalid to SegWit nodes but valid to unupgraded nodes. It's possible that pressure from the rest of the ecosystem (say a majority of upgraded nodes) would force the miners to go along with it, but at least temporarily there would be a split. 
And note that while a majority of nodes supports SegWit, they will not follow nodes that activate early.
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:24:19
I agree we can have both decentralisation and bigger blocks. But in the short term bigger blocks may hinder decentralisation. In the long term most transactions will have to move off-chain while still being anchored to it, perhaps using LN, perhaps treechains, perhaps both.

Well, that's why they're promoting the gateways. In fact, they're even deemphasising the decentralised part, much to my dislike, as I believe it's crucial. But the underlying core (validators and rippling) is still decentralised, and there is no centralised control over who gets to be a gateway.
It also unfair to criticise the gateway system as not fully decentralised, because in Bitcoin you would be relying on the even more centralised banking system instead. Ripple is much broader in scope. XRP ~= BTC, while gateways ~= banks + Bitcoin exchanges.
And of course, the biggest Bitcoin exchange (Bitstamp) is also a Ripple gateway and at least one other exchange (Kraken) intends to become one, so the systems are intertwined already.
In the short term, Ripple's distributed exchange can help Bitcoin grow. In the longer term each can and in my opinion will absorb features from the other, and we'll all be better off for it.

Payment channels work something like this:
- parties exchange public keys
- viewer locks up a small amount of bitcoin in a 2-of-2 multisig transaction but doesn't broadcast the transaction just yet because then the broadcaster could hold him to ransom
- viewer sends the broadcaster a signed, 24h timelocked refund transaction that refunds all the bitcoin to himself
- broadcaster signs the refund. viewer no longer has to worry about being held to ransom. unless viewer and broadcaster both sign a new agreement, he'll get his money back in a day.
- viewer broadcasts funding transaction and broadcaster optionally waits for confirmation
- broadcaster gives a small slice of video away for free or viewer prepays a small slice of video
- at the end of the slice the broadcaster proposes a new (unlocked and unsigned) refund transaction that pays the broadcaster a tiny bit more and the viewer a bit less
- if the viewer signs and returns the new refund transaction, the broadcaster sends the next slice of video
- at the end of the transmission the broadcaster can countersign and broadcast the last refund transaction
- if the broadcaster doesn't do this, the viewer can countersign and broadcast the original timelocked refund transaction 24h later and get his bitcoin back
So the risk is very small, maybe a minute of free video, depending on how often the refund transaction is updated.

It would need it eventually, if we want to serve &gt;7B people, but it can scale a lot even with 1MB blocks. Once we have LN, we can live with 1MB blocks for a long time. And with LN + tree chains, we might not need bigger blocks ever (though we might want them for other reasons). In fact, with LN for 7B users simply using bigger blocks may be insufficient as a scaling mechanism, you might still need something like tree chains.
I think a block size increase is good to keep around as an emergency solution, once the need for it is clear and the risk of a disastrous schism is avoided.
@_date: 2017-02-11 14:27:53
Huh? If nodes don't validate, then miners can get away with more, not less. And in the case of a soft fork like SegWit node validation makes no difference since the new rules are stricter than the old ones. Old nodes will always accept new blocks. That's what makes it a soft fork.

The concern isn't storage, but bandwidth. This has all sorts of non-obvious implications, such as higher block propagation time and the efficiency advantage of larger pools, which leads to more centralisation.
If a block size increase were a simple change that didn't have any disadvantages, everybody would be in favour of it. Unfortunately the advantages are easy to understand, while the disadvantages are difficult to understand.
As a consequence we have hordes of lemmings blindly following Gavin, thinking larger blocks will make them wealthy and shouting down the pleas for caution from some of the top technical minds in Bitcoin.

Those are two very different things, majority rule vs consensus.
If you think Bitcoin should be governed by majority rule, then you don't understand the first thing about it. If that's what we wanted, then we could just have a Bitcoin Foundation that owned the trademark and decided the rules of Bitcoin.
We wouldn't need proof-of-work, blocks could just be signed by the Bitcoin Foundation. Heck, we might not even need a blockchain and decentralised P2P relay at all, the Bitcoin Foundation would then essentially be a bank.
We've had electronic cash for a long time, what's new is decentralised peer-to-peer cash that's beyond the reach of governments and industry groups. Well, to the degree we have such a thing at all, because Bitcoin has become dangerously recentralised.
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:21:51
Do I need to spell it out? If the old chain survives nobody gets to decide, because then the old chain will continue to be Bitcoin. If it's contentious, then again probably nobody gets to make that call, since the old chain whether it survives or not will still be Bitcoin. Maybe if everybody agrees everybody will get to decide together, but maybe even then calling something else Bitcoin doesn't make it Bitcoin.

That's not true, the Lightning Network and later perhaps tree chains will be trustless off-chain solutions that will allow Bitcoin to scale. In fact, it's the other way round: with the quadratic scaling of fully on-chain Bitcoin we cannot serve &gt;7B users in a decentralised way without moving most transactions off-chain.

What hard fork?


That rule may be simple, but it is pure invention when it comes to choosing between hard forks. Nobody agreed to that when they got into Bitcoin and nobody was promised that. It does work for soft forks, simply as a side-effect of the fact that in a soft fork new blocks are always acceptable to old nodes. That's no longer true with a hard fork.
The rule that Bitcoin is what Satoshi defined to be Bitcoin (or something compatible with it, as in soft forks) is also simple and much more natural. It also has the advantage of not depending on the whim of the majority which goes against the whole design of Bitcoin.
(as an aside: it's not the longest chain, but the one with the most work, otherwise it's trivially broken)

The mutation could have been accidental. The output could still be spent as long as MtGox still had the key. But if they didn't look what outputs were in the wallet when they signed the redeeming transactions, they'd have to rely on the historical tx-ids they stored separately. Anything that wasn't on that list would not be transferred and transactions using tx-ids that had been mutated on their way to the blockchain would be invalid.
If they kept old cold storage keys, this would not be a problem. But if they were only ever kept on paper, they might have reasoned there was no need to keep them.
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:35:29


Transaction fees could take care of this, which is good, but that might make the blockchain useful only for very large transactions, which might be not so good. Then again, something like the Lightning Network could take care of that. Or maybe tree chains.
In the medium term Bitcoin can scale a lot with the current 1MB blocksize + something like Lightning. In the longer term even that will require something more powerful than the current blockchain, such as a blockchain with bigger blocks and / or tree chains.
Of these three mechanisms bigger blocks are more or less technically ready to be deployed, Lightning still needs a lot of work and tree chains need even more work. That makes bigger blocks the obvious candidate for a quick solution should it be needed.
But is it needed now? I see no evidence of that. Once people start complaining about long confirmation times, miners running out of RAM, transaction fees for actual non-frivolous payment transactions rising to levels that make Bitcoin uncompetitive with other payment systems, Streamium streams that won't stream because blocks fill up, THEN we can deploy bigger blocks fairly quickly.
A day may come when we need bigger blocks, when we break all bonds of blocksize bounds, but it is not this day. This day we fight! Oh wait, wrong speech.
Anyway, I don't think we should rush into something irreversible, especially since a hard-fork can lead to people losing money by accident. With the bigger block size change we have a good plan B on standby, which we can put into action once the signs of strain on the network become clear for everyone to see, at which time we'll quickly get the necessary consensus.

I suspect that once blocks fill up, many transactions will move off-chain one way or another, but probably not to an altcoin. They could move to hosted wallet solutions, which exist now, and then to something like the Lightning Network, once it becomes available.

Not yet, but that might happen eventually, especially with larger blocks. But the real problem I'm thinking of now is how to make sure that we have a healthy network of full nodes. Preferably that would include a sizable contingent communicating entirely over Tor, both as hidden services and as ordinary nodes simply communicating through Tor.

No, if one party is being unreasonable, we shouldn't reward them. Core have done their bit. We should activate SegWit first and then after some time we can evaluate it and see where to go next. A while ago people were leaning towards controlled growth to 8MB and extension blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:06:18
I dispute that blocks being full spells disaster. What matters is what happens to fees. If fees grow modestly, then there is no problem. If they grow explosively then it's also not a problem, because apparently Bitcoin is then being spectacularly successful, but it might represent a missed opportunity for even bigger success.

In fact that is the intended Bitcoin end-state: transaction fees that pay for the mining infrastructure, the block subsidy is only temporary. In that end-state mining profits will be only modest, not excessive, because of fierce competition. That means mining costs will be close to energy costs.
It's not inconceivable that a large number of users would be willing to pay a small annual price to help keep the network safe, without caring exactly how much bitcoin they get per kWh, since we're talking about small amounts anyway.
Add in the effects of essentially needing no additional space for hosting a tiny miner inside a device you want anyway and perhaps "free" electricity that's included in a fixed rent, and I think it's possible millions of people, perhaps tens or hundreds of millions, might be willing to own a device that consumes $10 a year in extra electricity costs.
I think the whole thing is far from a sure bet, but it might not be as crazy as it sounds at first.
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:39:27
My concern isn't with home users being unable to run a full node, but with miners being unable to mine in small pools because of the block propagation delay and miners being unable to hide behind Tor. That doesn't mean the block size has to stay at 1MB forever, just that I'm worried about increasing it soon unless it is absolutely necessary to avert an even bigger problem. And I don't believe that's the case.
@_date: 2015-05-31 10:27:38
When the fees become non-trivial, I too would advocate an increase, and I would expect a nearly universal consensus for that to arrive quickly. The BDB fork shows we can quickly roll out a change in those circumstances.
But it's not yet certain that will happen any time soon, as the LN can scale enormously even with 1MB blocks and might arrive in time to avoid the need for an emergency solution. In addition there are both technical risks and the risk of a disastrous schism.
For now I'm urging preparedness, rational discussion and caution, not precipitate action or a crusade against dissent.

Consensus is not the same as a simple majority or even a supermajority, it means near unanimity.
As far as I'm concerned, as long as the current chain survives it will be called Bitcoin. If it dies out through hostile action, it's difficult to say whether any other chain would inherit the name.
Note that it is possible for a new chain to eclipse Bitcoin in a non-hostile way through sidechains and/or proof of burn.
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:00:03
He didn't say the price would double though. The broader point is that the halving doesn't automatically cut the block reward expressed in dollars in half. It is hard to predict precisely what the price will be, but it stands to reason that it will rise as a result of half as many new bitcoins hitting the market each day. Whether it will be enough to compensate for the halving I don't know, but in dollar terms the reward will likely drop by less than 50%.

No, there isn't just one way. Bitcoin was intended to be *peer-to-peer* electronic cash. Peer-to-peer means txs happen between equals, where everybody acts individually. It isn't majority-to-minority or mob-to-the-1%. Everybody opted into the same set of fixed rules. A mob doesn't get to change the rules now. Conceivably the rules could be changed by unanimity, but not by a majority or even a supermajority. You could design a system that way, and maybe it could even work well (although existing fiat currencies suggest the opposite), but it wouldn't be peer-to-peer and it wouldn't be Bitcoin.

I don't know why you are so obsessed with old nodes not relaying SegWit spends. They don't, but it wouldn't matter if they did. No unupgraded wallet will produce a receiving address corresponding to a SegWit redeem script and consequently it will not recognise any SegWit outputs as its own.

Bullshit, you bet that's how it works. Bitcoin was supposed to be immutable, not subject to the whim of majorities. If that's what Satoshi intended, then that's what he would have said. If so, there would have been no need for proof of work and decentralisation.
The idea that Bitcoin is by definition the fork with the greatest market cap or the fork with the most work (even if not valid according to the original rules) is an outright lie that was created by the BU crowd. If that's what Satoshi had intended he would have said so and he would have designed the system very differently.
@_date: 2015-05-31 10:43:50
We can't yet count on tree chains, and even LN is still a while away, so it would be good to keep larger blocks around as an emergency measure. But even with LN + bigger blocks we'll still run into scaling problems eventually, and might still need something like tree chains.
I think it's too early to tell which of these three elements will be required for a Bitcoin that serves the whole world economy, but fortunately we don't have to do that right now. For now we just need to keep our options open.
@_date: 2016-03-25 11:21:10
No, that won't work because the feature will not activate until a supermajority of the hashing power supports it. Such malicious txs will not stay on the longest chain because a supermajority rejects them. Unupgraded nodes may see them as valid, but any unupgraded miners mining them into blocks will be overtaken by the supermajority soon enough.

The essence of Bitcoin is that it is trustless and beyond the reach of governments and other coercive groups. As far as I can tell that requires the concept that code is law. If you go beyond that, Bitcoin is just a very inefficient replicated database. The algorithms are impartial as long as they are fixed, and if you change them according to the wishes of a majority you'll have turned Bitcoin into yet another form of money governed by politics.
I suspect that is what most Core devs think, but it's basically how Satoshi defined Bitcoin. We're free to choose another set of rules and even to choose meta-rules for changing the rules, but that's not the system that Satoshi left us and therefore I'd argue not Bitcoin.

No, it doesn't make sense to hold. Speculating and mining are two independent processes. Mining is a fiat game, if it costs less to produce a bitcoin than you make selling it, then mining makes sense, regardless of what you think the price will do. If it costs more, then mining makes no sense, again regardless of what you think the price will do. If you think bitcoin prices will rise, then buying bitcoin and holding it makes sense, regardless of whether you bought or mined the bitcoin. It's possible to be engaged in both at the same time, but the skills required are different as are the risk profiles.

If the system is fully decentralised, every user will verify everybody else's transactions, which means the bandwidth requirements grow quadratically. Grow to ten times the number of users and you'll need a hundred times the (total) bandwidth.
As I'm typing this, I see that r/bitcoin currently has 166,118 readers. From that number it is safe to say that we have at most 100,000 users making a number of real Bitcoin payments similar to the number generated by an ordinary person in the fiat system, and almost certainly far fewer than that.
From 100,000 to 7B is a factor of 70,000. That means we'll need 70,000 * 70,000 = 4.9B times the bandwidth if we want a fully decentralised system with all transactions on-blockchain. There is no way that's going to be cost-competitive with existing fiat systems. And if the real number of txs is only that of 10,000 people (still generous I think), then the number is a hundred times greater still.

What's the rush? There are probably far more frivolous / non-payment / implicitly subsidised altcoin transactions than actual payment transactions. Once blocks start filling up these frivolous transactions will have to compete for space, which will drive up tx fees and drive out the more frivolous uses in favour of actual payment transactions. As long as actual payment volume is low, this will only crowd out nonfrivolous use, while causing only tiny increases in fees for serious use. Eventually, if actual payment volume takes off, this will cause tx fees for actual payment transactions to rise more than negligibly, up to the point where Bitcoin becomes unattractive compared to other systems. At that point everyone will be able to see it happening, and we'll quickly get an economic majority for a switch.
If anything it's the push for an immediate switch without adequate explanation that makes me hesitant to support it. We have a plan B in place already, no need to deploy it straight away, and no obvious gains either, as far as I can see.

You don't necessarily need to have every node keep a full copy, but it is the easiest way to achieve redundancy without coordination. But you could easily used something called a distributed hash table to divide the data over various nodes redundantly.

After every LN tx the resulting balance can be settled unilaterally and that works by publishing an already signed tx. It's not just a balance that just happens to be denominated in Bitcoin, it's a valid Bitcoin tx that is ready to be broadcast and confirmed at any time.

That's not the real point though, SegWit is safe even in the presence of malicious nodes. If an upgraded wallet generates a SegWit receiving address before the network is enforcing it, then there's a risk that a malicious miner will intercept a spending tx and replace it with one of its own, but doing so would be a bug. No SegWit wallet should generate SegWit receiving addresses or spend from them until after SegWit has activated.

By attacking the existing by censoring all but coinbase transactions. Existing clients will continue to run and will continue to see new blocks, but no new transactions would be confirmed. A new chain would be merge-mined with this totally crippled chain and could follow completely different rules.
This is what some of the gurus call a 'firm' soft fork. You can do this with just a supermajority of miners, but you can't do it in secret, people would notice.

Which is what SegWit does.

I think most of them will continue to work on Core, and more will be drawn to it. Core will remain the basis of "Classic", just as with most other alt-coins, simply because Core is what most of the dev community supports. I think the angry mob will find that they cannot succeed without the support of Core, and that Core will eventually be able to undo the harmful effects of this now nearly inevitable hard fork.

Still pushing for an unneeded hard fork.

By latency I don't just mean what's generally referred to as latency in networking, like pinging google.com and seeing it responds in 19ms.

I think the OP meant influencing the real-world outcome, not the result of the vote. For instance, suppose someone puts up a bounty to assassinate Edward Snowden / Barack Obama / pick your target by locking an amount of BTC into a transaction output that can only be spent by a key that somehow depends on the outcome of a vote on some prediction market. See realitykeys.com for something similar. Assuming the voting system is reliable and cannot be gamed, people would then have a financial incentive to go out and try to assassinate the target.

The most-work rule is only used to choose between valid chains, given a predefined notion of validity, not to define validity itself. For soft forks it would also act as a way to choose between competing forks. This was likely not foreseen by Satoshi, but it is compatible with his design, in fact it follows from it. Using most-work to decide between hard forks on the other hand is something that goes against the whitepaper, which quite clearly defines fixed rules.
Satoshi may not have foreseen the notion of soft forks at all when he wrote the whitepaper, though he quite deliberately introduced it later. He also introduced version numbers for txs and blocks (though not in the whitepaper), which also indicates an intention to allow some sort of flexibility. Also note that he removed OP_VER once he realised it would lead to hard forks.
@_date: 2017-02-11 17:57:19
If the old chain survives, then by definition it continues to be Bitcoin. If it doesn't, it's trickier. It could be argued that Bitcoin will have died, though some will no doubt claim their chain is Bitcoin because they want to inherit the market cap. Maybe it will be Bitcoin, or maybe it won't be even if people insist on calling it that.
It's like the story of Lincoln and the five-legged dog. "If you call a dog’s tail a leg, how many legs does a dog have?" "Five!" "No, the correct answer is four. Calling a tail a leg does not make it a leg."

HA! One bunch of thin blocks fans are telling me it's about bandwidth, the other it's about latency. Maybe for you it's about bandwidth, so let's look at that. It turns out that 88% of traffic comes from tx relaying and only 12% from block relaying. Let's say you cut block relaying to 10% of that 12%, in other words 1.2% of the total. Then you still have 88% + 1.2% = 89.2%, a savings of only 10.8%.
On the other hand, if you use Core 0.12 and blocksonly, then you need 12% just for the block relaying, a savings of 88%.

Here's one example:
Suppose you're on the minority fork and someone taints some coins with coins created in some majority block that's not part of the shared history of the two forks. Then any tx that conflicts with this transaction will be invalid on the majority fork, but valid on the minority fork. If that person that goes back and pays you with some of the inputs of that tainted transactions, it will be accepted on the minority fork. After a while you realise you're on the majority fork and think ok no problem, my coins exist on both forks, I'll just switch to the other fork. You download and install the other version and when you try to access your coins you discover that the majority fork doesn't recognise you as the owner of the coins because your transactions double spends the ealier tainting transaction.

It's not really suicide though. For companies like Coinbase it's their last shot. They don't care if they drag Bitcoin down with them, or *simply use it as a stepping stone* towards a unified worldwide fiat payment system. If everybody used the same fiat payment system, that would make things a lot more efficient. That's not nearly as ambitious a goal as gettings governments out of the money business, but it's something that could still make a business very successful. These people simply have different goals than we do.

It would result in a chain split if SegWit were activated with only a minority of the hash rate supporting it. Whether that split was permanent would depend on whether economic forces would cause the majority hash rate to change their minds. If they did, all unupgraded nodes would automatically switch to the other branch with them. In the long run the result would be the same as a soft fork, i.e. all old and new nodes would reach a consensus again.
In other words, a soft fork launched with minority hash rate support would be similar to a hard fork, though with the difference that the rift could (at least theoretically) be mended without end users having to upgrade.


No it doesn't.

I've already pointed you to AcceptToMemoryPoolWorker in
which does the IsStandard check. It is called by AcceptToMemoryPool, which in turn is called by ProcessMessage, which starts at line 4466 of
Line 4489 in this function is where a received tx is processed, selected by
if (strCommand == NetMsgType::TX)
At line 4926 it checks whether the tx can be accepted into the memory pool, and as we saw before this rejects the tx if it is non-standard:
if (!AlreadyHave(inv) &amp;&amp; AcceptToMemoryPool(mempool, state, tx, true, &amp;fMissingInputs, &amp;txFeeRate)) {
Now we only need to take a look at IsStandard to convince ourselves anyone-can-spend txs aren't considered standard.
We see that IsStandard calls Solver, defined on line 41 of 
Immediately above that the function GetTxnOutputType lists all the types of standard txs: "pubkey", "pubkeyhash", "scripthash", "multisig" and "nulldata".
SegWit outputs are (for now) always embedded inside a P2SH output. Only when you spend it is it revealed that it was a SegWit output. The provided redeem script must then match one of the other standard types than "scripthash". As you can see, anyone-can-spend is not on that list.

There is nothing evil about opt-in RBF, which attaches a big fat warning flag to every tx it might replace. And note that wallets should have been watching this flag already, since tx replacement has been part of Bitcoin since the beginning.

No, unlike soft forks hard forks are not about the longest chain, since the old version will never recognise blocks from the new chain past the first block that exceeds 1MB.

Yes, but we are nowhere near that.


No it doesn't, the improvement is 12% at most until we do something about the inefficiency of tx relaying, or turn it off as with -blocksonly. Still a useful addition, and I'm not arguing against using it, just pointing out it's not a game changer.
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:10:04

Transaction fees won't suddenly jump to $2, there will be a gradual rise at worst. And even that may not happen if LN arrives in time. If not, there will be plenty of time to roll out an increase, as the BDB hard fork showed.

Right now Bitcoin is usable as a payment system, but as the number of users grows, it will transition to being a settlement system. Some first usable version of LN will likely be operational long before Bitcoin becomes uneconomical for retail use.

You didn't correct me. Core has no influence on what people who run something else do. If miners start replacing non-flagged txs, then it's not because of something Core did.

Well, for starters someone has been [spamming]( the entire text of one of Gavin's essays into the block chain. Also, how do you explain a sudden flood of txs that just as suddenly disappears a few days later? And how do you explain long chains of moving the same coins over and over again?

No need to commit to a phase 2 yet, let's do SegWit and 2-4-8 first, as Core is already planning.
@_date: 2016-03-31 23:37:40
Each individual LN tx immediately results in a new balance tx. The LN tx isn't finalised until the balance tx has been updated.


The requirement for having large amount of funds in order to run a centralised hub actually provides a disincentive to run them.


How could a LN node censor txs? The system will route around it if it does and it can only delay the release of funds, not freeze them to begin with. It would also damage its reputation if it did.

@_date: 2016-03-05 10:27:39
SegWit is going through design iterations. All of these iterations are soft forks of the current Bitcoin protocol, but sometimes they are hard forks of each other. As is saying, backwards compatibility between test versions isn't important.

In other words, your claim was false and you're now shifting the goalposts. Yes, if blocks are full, no more txs can be supported, that much is clear. That's also true for "Classic", which is also proposing 2MB blocks, so there's no real difference from that perspective. Real scaling will have to come from a combination of improved internet infrastructure and better algorithms.


It was reliable if you used a modern wallet.

@_date: 2016-03-14 13:23:53
Non-mining nodes don't need to worry about latency, though they might care about bandwidth. In that case, running 0.12 in blocksonly mode will reduce traffic by far more than thin blocks as 80% of the traffic comes from tx relaying, not block relaying.
Miners on the other hand care about latency, and thin blocks are actually inferior to the relay network.
At best this is a small improvement for non-mining nodes. It will certainly not allow scaling, let alone massive scaling.
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:33:57


He linked to it himself: 


HA! You bet I understand the difference. Yes, thin blocks reduce the propagation delay on the P2P network, but miners don't use that, they use the relay network which offers much better latency. Not only does it offer better latency than the current P2P network, it also beats thin blocks as it only uses 2 bytes per tx compared to 32 for thin blocks.

Blocks. The relay network remembers which unconfirmed txs it has
relayed to each node and uses 16 bit indexes to identify them in blocks. Thin blocks on the other hands use txids which are 32 bytes long.


Not really, it will save you about 11% at best, whereas Core 0.12 with blocksonly will save you 88%.


I never said we shouldn't have it, just that people are very much mistaken if they think it is a game changer.


They can and will, I'm just saying it won't help ordinary nodes very much.


Latency doesn't matter for non-mining nodes, so any benefits of thin blocks in that department are of no use to them.

He agrees scaling is problematic and that a lot of txs will have to move off-chain. I don't understand how that is compatible with thinking it's bad to aim for Bitcoin being a settlement system. He is concerned that LN may turn out to be centralised, with negative consequences for privacy and censorship-resistance. He's not predicting it will be, just saying we cannot know in advance just as we couldn't predict mining centralisation in advance.

@_date: 2016-01-15 22:29:26
I agree, but why couldn't Core simultaneously commit to a vote on 2-4-8 at the end of the year? By that time the results of IBLT and weak blocks should be in, and based on those results miners could still call the whole thing off. We could always schedule another vote later. Or preschedule a series of votes next year. I'm not saying this is technically necessary, but I'm arguing it would be acceptable and should allow us to heal this rift.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:55:41
They are indeed not mutually exclusive, but they both effectively move to 2MB, only SegWit does it much more safely.

I don't know what the percentage is and I'm too lazy to find out right now, but you should be able to find that information from a block explorer.


Look at  and you'll see that miners are creating blocks that aren't full all the time even though there are plenty of transactions in TradeBlock's mempool. Somehow miners must not like those txs, because there is plenty of space in their blocks.

Doing it as a hard fork in the coming months is much riskier. Do you think you have a better handle on this than the vast majority of developers?

See [series]( of articles on it.
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:44:49
Certainly. Bear in mind that every user that uses SegWit reduces his own block space usage and therefore frees up space for everyone else too.
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:46:14
It isn't necessary, but a large section of the community has decided they no longer trust the Core developers. They are well within their rights to do this, but I believe it's also spectacularly ill-advised.
 I think they'll find that they've been misled and that they can't run this thing without the Core devs, but time will tell.

A hard fork needs a lead time of a year to be done safely. I'm personally in favour of it, but some work still needs to be done for that. And SegWit will be operational long before then, provided miners support it.

@_date: 2017-02-26 17:52:11
The advantage of soft forks is that people don't have to upgrade at exactly the same time (=exactly the same block height) as long as a majority of the hash rate has upgraded. It is certainly possible to pick a flag date, but if less than a majority of the hash rate has upgraded by that time, the chain will split at least temporarily. That means that some people will lose money.
So if we restrict your question to non-mining nodes, the answer is that it is risky to do it without a majority of the hash power. If you include the miners, the answer probably has to do with ulterior motives.

The relay network uses 2 bytes per tx, thin blocks use 32.


If you're not a miner there's no reason for you to do so.


There's nothing wrong with using thin blocks, it's just that they will do you only very limited good if you are a non-miner, and actually be harmful if you are a miner.


Because the relay network gives you better latency than thin blocks.

The crash isn't due to Core doing nothing because 1) Core isn't doing nothing but has a well thought out and broadly supported roadmap for addressing the scaling challenge and 2) there is no crisis. The crash is due to Hearn, Andresen and their corporate allies driving a wedge between the development community and low info retards like yourself. If you want to stop the crash, learn to shut the fuck up while developers are doing a great job surmounting the scaling challenge.

SegWit already constitutes an increase, and after things like IBLT and weak blocks have been implemented and evaluated (probably around the end of the year) a decision will be made on some sort of moderate, gentle increase. That will probably be a variant of 2-4-8.

LN will certainly be Bitcoin, and its balances aren't just denominated in Bitcoin, they are held in actual on-chain multisig outputs. Adjustments of these balances are also valid Bitcoin txs that can be broadcast to the blockchain at any time. Most of the time they don't need to be broadcast because keeping them as a recourse mechanism is enough and doing the adjustments off-chain is faster, more private and cheaper.

I think the only way this makes things slightly riskier if adopted by miners is that it will allow hand-crafted malicious non-final txs to be mined into blocks more easily. And those can indeed be used to trick merchants who are unwise enough to use a wallet that doesn't check for the flag.

Satoshi wasn't talking about general voting systems, he was talking specifically in the context of establishing a consensus on the contents (not the rules) of the blockchain. It is true that PoW serves to prevent ballot-stuffing (Sybil attacks), but Satoshi didn't propose a voting mechanism *on changing the rules*. The type of voting he was talking about was limited precisely to selecting and ordering txs, as I said above.
A voting mechanism with on-chain votes for changing the rules of Bitcoin itself wasn't introduced until much later, after Satoshi had left. The ISM voting mechanism used for soft forks was introduced by BIP34 and earlier forks were done without even having a vote.

It has nothing to do with mining technology, only with network connections.


50% so I can see your point of view of not hurting the Chinese competitors to oblivion.
It doesn't even require that consideration. If Chinese miners do control &gt;50% of total hashing power and blocks are so large that they can't cross the Great Firewall of China quickly, then it's everybody outside that's on the wrong side of the GFW. They will find that their blocks are orphaned much more. In other words, they'd be shooting themselves in the foot, even if the market didn't worry about 51% attacks.
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:45:03
Be aware though that this is a 'firm' soft fork that 51% attacks the old chain and merge mines a new one along with it. It will cause unupgraded sw to become unusable and force everyone to upgrade. Nearly all experts on both sides of the debate think it's a horrible idea for that reason.

At worst tx fees might go up a bit and some low value payments might get crowded out. If that happens, it indicates Bitcoin is very successful which means the price will have risen quite a bit.

Depends on the wallet. Tx replacement has been part of Bitcoin from the beginning, and wallets should have treated non-final txs as risky already. I've heard Bitcoinj has long done this.

@_date: 2017-03-09 17:23:56
That depends on what you mean by 'work'. If you're willing to accept disruption you can just pick a flag date. On that date all upgraded nodes will start enforcing SegWit and will reach a new consensus with each other. Whether they will reach a consensus with unupgraded nodes (including BIP9 SegWit nodes such as 0.13.1 - 0.14.0) does depend on the hash rate. If the UASF nodes activate with just a minority of the hash rate, then the chain will split at least temporarily.
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:23:43


In fact, if we want to serve &gt;7B people, then most transactions will have to move off-chain, or we'll end up with truly ridiculously large blocks which are totally incompatible with decentralisation.

An uncontentious soft fork that is adopted by a 95% majority of miners seems pretty good to me though. In theory a hard fork could be enforced by 50% + 1, but they couldn't do this without the rest of the world noticing it and potentially switching to a different PoW.
@_date: 2016-01-31 13:00:12
I think the best way to gain consensus is to start with a cabal of VC-funded companies that are about to run out of money unless Bitcoin adoption suddenly goes through the roof. You then hire some well-known people as figureheads for a campaign for bigger blocks.
It's important to line up a bunch of fallacious arguments in favour of radically bigger blocks in advance, perhaps as a series of blog posts.
If one of these figureheads is a well-known arrogant asshole who disagrees with Bitcoin's cypherpunk ethos, then it's important to have another figurehead who can appear as the voice of reason. This other person should appear to engage in honest discussion, like a good cop bad cop routine. But be aware, it's only the appearance of honest discussion that we want, under no circumstances should true honesty be entertained.
In order to pull this off, one needs to appeal to some base instincts in the wider community. The first is greed, which is what drew most people to Bitcoin anyway. Spin a narrative under which people's chances of striking it rich are greatly damaged if the block size limit isn't lifted almost immediately. It helps if this is only hinted at by the figureheads, while more radical anonymous sockpuppets push the full narrative.
This brings in the next appeal to emotion: insinuate that the opposing party is driven by greed itself. The greedy masses will instantly believe this, since greed is their own motivation.
All of this is helped by the fact that the technical and economic issues are far too difficult for the average person to understand. Attracted to big blocks by greed and repelled from the side urging caution by distrust they will choose to believe the narrative they want to be true. In this they will be aided by the Dunning-Kruger effect which will lead people with a very shallow understanding to expend great effort to spread their gospel of big blocks.
While doing this, one should take great care that one's own proposals are not in fact reasonable, for that raises the spectre of compromise and, well, reason. Therefore, one should propose a change that is as radical as possible, but not so radical that the angry masses will see it as excessive. In order to paint the opposing side as obstructionists, it's important to make sure no actual progress is made. This lack of progress can then be used as a pretext to take unilateral action later.
Another important aspect is to maintain a sense of urgency, as that drowns out rational thought. In addition, it's difficult to keep anger levels high for a prolonged period of time. For this reason the initial proposal should already include an utterly unreasonable time frame. Dire predictions should be employed to justify this. If necessary invent pompous-sounding terms like 'Fidelity Effect' or 'Fee Event'.
As the campaign gathers steam, it is important for the cabal behind it to maintain radio silence, for it has to look like a grass-roots campaign. While this will be completely transparent to anyone with half a brain, it won't be obvious to the masses blinded by greed and suspicion or to the mass media who aren't paying attention. It is wise however to have several 'independent' industry voices express support for the radical plan in a personal capacity. 
After a sufficient level of anger has been reached, CEOs of various companies in the cabal can pretend to join a bandwagon, without of course admitting they were the driving force behind it all along. It's best if they coordinate this, but don't do it all at the same time, as then the collusion would be too obvious. Even then, the fiction of acting in a personal capacity should be maintained for as long as possible.
In the final stages various industry groups can issue formal support for an official plan, declaring that "the debate is now over", "the dust has settled" etc.

No it wasn't. The job of the miners is to create a consensus ledger, which means choosing and ordering transactions and nothing more.
@_date: 2016-03-26 21:48:30
A soft fork means that all txs and blocks that are valid under the new rules are also valid under the old rules, which is the case here. This (combined with the fact that a soft fork doesn't activate until it has a supermajority) ensures there won't be a split in the chain and that only miners need to upgrade to ensure success.
@_date: 2016-03-19 10:50:16

@_date: 2016-01-21 19:05:41
One big difference: LN balances are valid Bitcoin txs that you can post to the blockchain at any time.


Not really, that is what would happen with an ordinary payment channel of the kind that Streamium uses. But LN will use multi-hop routing. This means that through your payment channel to Starbucks you can make payments to anyone who can be reached from Starbucks through a number of hops. For instance, another business frequented by a common customer. The balances along the whole path do have to be high enough to allow the payment to go through of course.

That's simply not true. Even though a balance that hasn't been published isn't part of the ledger, it can be published at any time and become part of the ledger. It's totally unlike ChangeTip, which gives you an IOU. Either side can publish a signed tx at any time. There is no way for balances not to be covered by actual bitcoins or for parties to change balances unilaterally.

@_date: 2016-01-17 15:05:56
I can't remember who said it, but the claim was it has long supported it, not that it's going to be added. Tx replacement and sequence numbers have been part of Bitcoin all along.

They proposed 2-4-8 until Luke discovered a way to do SegWit as a soft fork. 2-4-8 is still the next step, then something like flexcap.
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:00:22


Core isn't trying to make people believe hard forks are always dangerous. They are acceptable if they're necessary, uncontroversial and have a long lead time. If we had a consensus today we could do a hard fork that fixes malleability next year, though in that case we'd probably choose to do it with a different hashing flag rather than SegWit. The reason we're going with SegWit now is because it is the quickest safe way to get more breathing room. As far as the Core team is considered there is no rush, after all blocks are only [60%]( full, but the big blocks side is eager for an increase soon.
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:28:46
I'm not sure how centralised they would be, but that's much less crucial if they are untrusted. You could always withdraw your coins to the blockchain.

You're a liar.
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:46:52
LN actually, vanilla payment channels have existed for a while. Also gives us time to work on IBLT, weak blocks, blocktorrent and 2-4-8. And those together will allow tremendous scaling within a year or two.
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:20:22
I think that's the plan Core has too, although they might schedule the hard fork a year later, say early 2018.
@_date: 2016-03-06 15:31:01
No he did not, the mempool is back to 3-5K txs.
@_date: 2016-03-17 00:54:30
The block isn't valid if it only has a valid header, I don't know where you got that idea. Fully validating nodes will reject such blocks. Also, you're not using the right terminology, hard fork is not synonymous with persistent split.
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:40:02
Which is what SegWit is doing.
@_date: 2016-01-06 18:03:40
SegWit will be up and running in Q1 or Q2.
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:53:31
If fees rise, that's a sign Bitcoin is successful, and no cause for worry. It would be nice if we could also capture low value payment transactions, but it's by no means urgent. We'll likely do that soon enough with LN, but even if that weren't the case high fees aren't the disaster people make it out to be.

@_date: 2017-03-04 14:59:14


No my friend, I'm not the one who is misunderstanding things.
I'm not disagreeing with the goals of the UASF, or how it works under the hood, I'm denying it could legitimately claim the name Bitcoin while it had only a minority of the hash rate behind it. It might quickly gain a majority (and even the threat of that might be enough to make the miners fall in line before a split even occurred), but it would only *be* Bitcoin once it reached consensus with unupgraded nodes.
@_date: 2016-03-25 14:19:04
Yeah, that's what I meant. Upgraded wallets should not use SegWit txs until it is being enforced, which will happen once 95% supports it.
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:15:37
You'd have to count the empty blocks, but they must make up substantially less than 10% of all blocks. So let's take 900kb as full.
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:51:37
2MB we could maybe commit to, but then we'd still need some mechanism like the new signature hashing mechanism to deal with rogue transactions and quadratic scaling. But I'd hope the next step after SegWit would be something like 2-4-8, not just a bump to 2MB.
@_date: 2016-03-17 00:43:54
I didn't bash anything, I wondered about a potential abuse scenario and said I'd be interested in an analysis.

If a majority prefers to use BTU they can do so without hijacking the name Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:57:55
I still don't understand why you think the miners are stressed or feel they have been insulted. It's not as if the developers have been intentionally delaying SegWit. Also, I've yet to see a convincing explanation why a hard fork is needed in the first place (as opposed to some other form of scaling), so it seems clear that at the very least these miners weren't honest about their motives, which is not a great way to earn people's trust and respect.
@_date: 2016-01-09 09:33:08


Argument from incredulity. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:18:38
Wallet providers that send RBF transactions will have to take this into account anyway, and those who don't won't be affected. And on the processing side companies like Coinbase and BlockCypher already take opt-in RBF into account. Actually, all wallets should consider non-final txs to be suspicious as tx replacement has always been part of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-06 07:07:10
Yes, you misunderstood. Please stop spreading misinformation. What's being merged is the confusingly named opt-in RBF, which should be renamed RBF with warning. It only replaces transactions that have a big fat warning flag set. All merchants and merchant processors have to do is to watch this flag. No processors have complained about this, though there have been many alarmist posts by FUDsters about it.
@_date: 2016-01-09 09:12:46
We now know that lots of changes that were previously thought to require a hard fork can be done with a soft fork.

I'm sure he doesn't.
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:58:35
No it isn't, don't believe people who claim otherwise. Opt-in RBF facilitates respends to increase fees, and nothing else, provided the recipient watches a flag that has always existed.
Coinbase already does this, so merchants using them are already covered. I'm told Hearn's own Bitcoinj also does. Blockcypher, the zero conf service used by Streamium does as well.
Garzik and Andresen also signed off on this. What you're hearing is more scare-mongering by Hearn. And you are also seeing the effects of the breakdown in trust between Core and a large section of the community. People are seeing conspiracies where none exist.
@_date: 2016-01-24 09:47:28

I think there's quite difference between convincing 5% or 75% to change their mind.
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:24:44
No, the analogy fails. Having full blocks or still having txs in the mempool just after a block is created does not mean there is an outage. This is a totally normal situation.
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:09:18
Core won't add a double spend button. For now they're not even adding a bump fee button.
@_date: 2016-01-16 12:07:02
It's SegWit, not SigWit, but yes SegWit can work on top of 2MB base blocks and vice versa. But SegWit will be ready to be deployed sooner than a hard fork, so it would actually be SegWit that buys us time to do a hard fork, rather than the other way around. And if you do it like that, you might as well go to 2-4-8 in the hard fork, rather than just 2MB.
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:49:12
Then you either wait for confirmation, or replace your transaction with one that doesn't have the flag set.
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:04:46
That's how soft forks are always done.
@_date: 2016-01-07 15:52:20
No it's not. Full blocks does not mean overloaded, let alone massively overloaded. It's working just fine, you just need to add a small fee. If fees were going through the roof, then you might have a point. But even then it still means Bitcoin is very successful, and at worst represents a lost opportunity for even bigger success.
@_date: 2017-02-04 22:56:23

I'm not sure, but it probably involves a rabbi and a priest...
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:50:32
I wonder if taking coin age into account would help. They're getting rid of the old priority mechanism, but maybe something more sophisticated would help. Rising fees will solve the problem of course, but with more effective filtering maybe fees might have to rise less.
@_date: 2016-01-24 11:30:32
Looks as if they are trying to buy time to coordinate a contentious hard fork by blocking a soft fork.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:48:07


It could be combined with a miners' vote and Core could release a version that did that.
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:51:28
A hard fork is easier if it has a long lead time.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:27:58


Yep, just as with nearly every other alt-coin and this will not change, because most of the brain power is behind Core and moon maths brain power is in short supply. They can either follow Core, or be forced to deliver inferior functionality. They cannot out-innovate Core.
Also, VC mercenaries will run out of cash before cypherpunks run out of idealism. They may control the block size for a number of years, but in the end they will fail.
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:15:20
It isn't just the threshold, the lead time is also important. A hard fork to 2MB next year would be fine, if a SegWit soft fork goes first. Doing both as a hard fork next year would also be fine, but stupid since a soft fork is faster and the changes are useful for other things than scaling too. You'd also be delaying LN.
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:58:14
Sure, but that doesn't mean they get to take the name Bitcoin with them.
@_date: 2016-01-30 14:43:47
The metric that interests me the most is USD price per typical transaction.
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:05:49
Because txs are prioritised based on fee rate because block space is limited to 1MB. The segregated witness part of the data doesn't use up any of that space so transactions that use it can use the same fee rate but still end up smaller and cheaper.
@_date: 2017-02-08 21:57:02

I'm saying it wouldn't be *safe* with a lead time of less than a year, not that it would be technically impossible.
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:24:27


With LN users still store their own keys and create their own transactions, but they only need to broadcast them to the blockchain if the (peer-to-peer) intermediate nodes don't cooperate, or to open and close channels.

How about ordinary users?

Merging opt-in RBF vs unrestricted full RBF makes a big difference. Much of the criticism of opt-in RBF actually makes sense if they were merging full RBF. That makes me think many people don't understand the crucial difference.

The SegWit testnet is already up and running and several wallets have already committed to supporting it: breadwallet, BitGo, mSIGNA, GreenAddress, GreenBits, Blocktrail, and NBitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:37:38
No, you are wrong. In the *worst* case the block will be 4MB long, in the typical case it will be close to 2MB. There will be a little bit of inefficiency until we have native SegWit addresses or better compression in the wire protocol, but nothing drastic.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:10:05
SegWit miners will happily build on top of non-SegWit blocks and vice versa.
@_date: 2016-03-14 17:43:59
No, ordinary nodes don't care about block propagation latency, only miners do and they aren't helped by thin blocks, as the relay network offers superior performance.
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:58:55
That is what's happening. And for a non-mining node latency isn't important. The only thing that remains is 12% less bandwidth use at best. Still useful, but not a huge breakthrough.
@_date: 2016-03-14 19:30:17
The relay network is much more efficient than thin blocks, so not only do thin blocks not give a huge improvement, they actually make things worse.
@_date: 2016-01-10 14:45:13
That's exactly what SegWit does, it's not a hypothetical concept. And it can all be done as a soft fork, an unupgraded client couldn't tell the difference. This is the [roadmap]( Core is following. It's already operational on a separate [testnet]( and several wallets have committed to supporting it.
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:25:50
SegWit needs 95% support of miners for activation, there is no flag day.
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:37:01
The point is that that requires information we don't have yet, specifically the effect of IBLT and weak blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:33:14
If it activates with a minority of the hash rate behind it, it's almost a hard fork. The main difference is that the rift is not necessarily permanent and only requires miners to upgrade to heal the rift.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:13:00
Except that many of them probably sincerely believe it. Doesn't make it any less wrong though.
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:48:41
No, it has always been bandwidth, not storage.
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:43:32


That's far too short for a hard fork as everybody would have to upgrade. It requires a year or more lead time. And it's not just me saying that, it's what Andresen and Hearn have been saying too.
@_date: 2016-01-17 12:42:24
Nonsense, the wallet won't allow arbitrary respends, just fee bumps. Maybe not even that in 0.12.
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:30:47
So-called "Classic" would be the alt, they can just continue to work on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-14 16:56:28
Yes, and that's more or less what SegWit is doing too, only with a much safer soft fork.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:36:26


No, that's not true. Whatever reaches a consensus with Bitcoin nodes implementing the rules as Satoshi left them is Bitcoin. A majority soft fork satisfies that criterion, but a minority doesn't. A~~n economic majority~~ majority of nodes forcing its will on the community is still mob rule.
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:48:52
There would be a split if it activated with a minority of the hash rate behind it and if someone deliberately mined a block that would be valid under the old rules, but invalid under SegWit.
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:06:26
It was in the [announcement]( on the bitcoin dev list.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:42:30


Sorry, but it is. You have the right to your own opinion, but you don't have the right to your own facts.
A soft fork will safely upgrade with only supermajority support among miners, and everybody can then upgrade at their own leisure while their software continues to work. A hard fork requires everybody to upgrade at once or risk losing money.
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:48:41
The point of SegWit is to buy time to lay the foundation for 2-4-8 and LN.
@_date: 2016-01-01 17:41:48
Not with a 2MB cap.
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:56:18
Not a Core dev, but the only real problem is with the hard fork, the rest can be worked around. Hard forks are dangerous and should only be done if they are necessary, uncontentious and have a long lead time. For this fork none of these conditions is satisfied.
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:01:37
I suppose that could happen if they continued to mine, but that would be very damaging to Bitcoin and the price of Bitcoin. It would be safer for them to turn off their hashing as most of their costs are for electricity.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:01:48
Of course it will. Something like 2-4-8 will be the next step. Remember, even LN will require larger blocks eventually.
@_date: 2016-01-07 00:38:58
No it doesn't, it also includes any spam that accumulates. The best metrics I can think of are fees vs confirmation time and payment amount.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:22:03


Sure, and that's true for both hard forks and soft forks. But for soft forks, if they have a majority then that majority will *be* Bitcoin, being the most-work valid chain. People on the big blocks side have long been misrepresenting that rule as applying to hard forks too, but it's totally true for soft forks. Conceivably the unfortunate situation of an attack branch having a majority will not last long, but until the other side gains a majority the non-SegWit branch will be Bitcoin and it would be fraudulent to claim otherwise.


Yes, that would be the hope, but unfortunately it's not certain.

It will be propagated among the majority of miners, and accepted by non-SegWit nodes. This means there will be a split at least temporarily, even if economic pressure will cause it to collapse eventually. As long as the attack branch has the majority it will be Bitcoin. It's true that SegWit nodes will ignore it, but that doesn't mean it won't be Bitcoin.

It should because tx replacement has been a part of Bitcoin since the beginning, even though replacement has long been disabled in Core. But if not, yes people will need to upgrade. Or if they use a third-party service like Coinbase or BlockCypher, then they're already covered, because they take the flag into account.

No, people like Wuille, Maxwell, Back.

So? The next step is still a hard fork, after the results of IBLT and weak blocks are in and with a proper lead time.

He also did next to nothing to stop the outrageous character assassination of Blockstream employees. He should have disowned it immediately and forcefully. I remember him standing on a stage two years ago declaring he had no interest in politics. In actual fact he is the one who introduced disastrously divisive politicking to Bitcoin. Passing the torch to Andresen was Satoshi's biggest mistake.

That's the firm soft fork which nobody wants. SegWit is a normal soft fork albeit a complicated one.

That's not Core's fault. Merging opt-in RBF doesn't make this any more likely.

Not because we need to be near the limit constantly, but because hard forks need a lead time of a year or so to be safe.
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:18:25
Thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:26:24
You keep repeating the question. The answer remains the same. SegWit is only the first step, which buys us some time by raising the effective block size through a soft fork. Then 2-4-8, which in case you didn't understand it increases the block size further through a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:29:45
I don't disagree, I've [advocated]( something similar myself.
@_date: 2016-01-10 09:27:47
I'd like to see a panel discussion between Brewster, Rizun and Stolfi.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:14:34
After activation SegWit nodes do not require the witness section to be present, they merely require it to be valid *if* it's present. And unupgraded nodes never see the witness section to begin with, so they aren't bothered by it.
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:55:39
The retards and tech douchebros will run their chain into the ground and run out of VC money soon enough. Nearly all innovation will continue to come from Core and the only real use case so far, darknet markets, will be served better by Core.
There's a small chance of a reconciliation, but we'll likely have to deal with a setback of a number of years. We should not give up control of the Bitcoin brand, let the schismatics build their own brand. Eventually we'll likely not have much of a choice and be forced to kick the schismatics out of this sub. Regrettable, but they brought this upon themselves.
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:42:56
I would like to see a commitment by Core to a vote at the end of the year on activating 2-4-8 (not just 2MB) early next year, which is the plan anyway. If the results of IBLT and weak blocks aren't in by that time, then the miners can still call it off and we can schedule a new vote later. Or we could preschedule a series of votes next year. See 
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:48:38
Yes, Moore's "law" is not what we should be looking at. I'm not sure if there are good laws for predicting bandwidth growth, especially 20 years out. What we do know is that the technology for gigabit internet already exists, and that people in some places already have it at home. It's a matter of time before everybody has it, the question is exactly, or even roughly, how long it will take.
@_date: 2016-01-07 00:39:40

Yes it is, or 2-4MB to be more precise.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:37:56
A hard fork done sooner than that would be inexcusably reckless. And don't forget: blocks are only [60%]( full on average, and half of the txs have a value &lt; $1. We still have some time.
@_date: 2017-03-04 12:38:18
By directly contacting the miners. It may not make much of a difference now that mining has become so centralised, but tx relay is part of the distributed defence mechanism against nation state attack.

That still doesn't give me all the data. We need back-to-back comparisons or else it's meaningless.

Ah, as a precaution, that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:56:00


The Core side wants the Bitcoin blockchain to remain an impartial ledger, one that is not controlled by political processes. As soon as you start negotiating about hard forks, you give up on that. Core could negotiate about all sorts of things, but not about hard forks as that would mean surrendering.
And we don't even need hard forks, we can do off-chain scaling and even on-chain scaling can be done with soft forks and extension blocks.
Asking Core to negotiate a hard fork is tantamount to asking them to surrender. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:45:23
See [series]( of articles on SegWit.
@_date: 2016-03-23 21:39:54
Depends on what HODLers and buyers do. If they don't like the new blocks, nobody will buy the new Bitcoins minted in them and miners will be forced to abandon their fork.
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:52:06


Doesn't matter for a soft fork, which doesn't split the chain and only activates with 95% support.
@_date: 2016-01-11 06:57:25
Six months is too soon. And the code has to be ready to be merged before you can set a date. Fortunately SegWit is a soft fork, so it doesn't need a long lead time. It does still require extensive review.
@_date: 2017-03-04 12:32:14
Nice consensus ledger you have there, it would be a pity if it were to split.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:33:33
Yes, a minority soft fork will lead to a split, which makes it very similar to a hard fork. One big remaining difference is that the split may not be permanent even without upgrading end-user nodes.
@_date: 2016-03-17 00:59:15
Ok, no problem.
@_date: 2016-01-12 22:18:13
It's a supermajority alright, but not a consensus.
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:07:24


Doing SegWit first is even safer. We can do a hard fork next year.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:44:57
@_date: 2016-01-24 12:47:53
They will be affected if there's a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:02:01
They can still validate the block under the old rules. A valid SegWit block will always have a non-witness section that is valid under the old rules. It's merely the case that old nodes cannot fully validate the SegWit txs in the blocks. They do still see the non-witness part of all SegWit txs, and they can verify that the coins involved aren't double-spent or created out of thin air.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:39:53
Yes, *all* defensive options, not just the first one that comes to mind.
@_date: 2016-03-14 16:41:53
My point is not that thin blocks are harmful or useless, it's just that they only have a small effect on your bandwidth requirements.
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:52:31
Because it isn't. And fee estimators will improve as soon as this becomes a real problem.
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:39:40


The wallet will still only allow it if it bumps the fee, not if it is a malicious double spend. If people are sending malicious txs they will not be doing it with unpatched Core.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:30:32
It's not a function of the size of the change, it's because of the nature of hard forks. Any hard fork needs a long lead time if you want to do it safely. Everybody has to upgrade at the same time. That's a lot easier if you hardcode a flag day far in the future, because by the time we reach it most people will have upgraded already, perhaps even several times.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:13:09


Huh? How do they do it now without a hard fork?
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:30:08
It's not about 2MB, though some miners are concerned about anything larger than 2MB until the results of IBLT and weak blocks are in. That should happen around the end of the year.
The main concern is over this being a hard fork. Hard forks are dangerous and therefore only acceptable if they are necessary, uncontentious and have a lead time of a year or more. So-called "Classic" doesn't satisfy any of these criteria.
@_date: 2016-01-24 09:26:57
I agree in general, but Matthew Green is an expert (Zerocash!), a gentleman and someone who wants Bitcoin to succeed. We should take his opinions very seriously.
@_date: 2016-03-13 22:25:09
Yeah, it contains great stuff, but how do you coordinate signatures between inputs?
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:54:50
An upgraded node will itself create valid vN+1 blocks, but won't reject invalid ones, provided they are still valid under the old rules.
After we reach 75% vN+1 blocks, it will start enforcing the rules for vN+1 blocks generated by other nodes.
After we reach 95% it will reject vN blocks and continue to enforce the new rules for all blocks.
Old nodes will consider all of these blocks valid and will simply follow the longest chain, making sure there is no fork in the chain.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:30:33
Why would that matter?
@_date: 2016-01-09 09:49:27
Don't change the subject, that's not what he said.
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:01:33
It's not a no against an increase by hard fork, though it is a vote against doing one this year. My preference would be for everyone to agree that something like 2-4-8 will be the next step and to schedule either a one-off vote at the end of the year or a series of votes next year to activate it. After all, the only doubt seems to revolve around when exactly to activate it. Some Chinese miners for instance are worried about anything larger than 2MB before we've seen the effects of IBLT and weak blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:00:17
Delaying a soft fork because it's allegedly too risky (second-guessing the experts) while doing a hard fork without a lead time of a year is retarded. SegWit still needs to go first and the HF still needs a lead time of a year. There's no reason both couldn't be activated with the same vote however.

I haven't see Garzik complain about it to be honest.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:23:28
So? The Core plan is 2MB soon and safely and 2-4-8 as a hard fork later, either next year or in early 2018. I haven't seen a single convincing argument that we need to risk a hard fork this year. I haven't even seen a convincing explanation of why some people want this, but they clearly do. I'm genuinely curious.
And note I'd personally be fine with 2-4-8 early next year, I'm not against hard forks in general, just against hard forks that are unnecessary, contentious or that don't have an adequate lead time.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:11:08
Sure, and I think all miners should at the very least install a SegWit border node and start signaling readiness for SegWit. But if SegWit activates with only minority support then as soon as someone mines a malicious block a split will occur. And there can be little doubt that a certain someone will buy himself just such a block if there is a UASF.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:48:59
It's not a terrible idea, it pushes up the cost of an attack. And with unbounded mempools nodes would keel over eventually. Mempool expiration removes an attack vector.
@_date: 2016-01-02 19:17:04
For some cases it might be good enough, but I'd recommend they upgrade. I think a mostly SPV future as with XT is retarded.
@_date: 2016-01-11 12:04:15
Don't be ridiculous, this has nothing to do with opt-in RBF.
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:40:10
Sure, and that's what I expect to happen, at least for a while. So-called "Classic" will remain an ever-rebased patch on top of Core, just like most alt-coins.
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:31:55
The problem is that the validation time of individual transactions can (and likely do) grow quadratically in the size of the transaction. In other words a transaction twice the size can take four times as long to validate.
@_date: 2016-01-10 14:05:32
It would be more convincing if he could give an actual reason for doing this as a hard fork rather than a soft fork as with SegWit.
@_date: 2016-01-19 20:27:07
Could you explain what the difference would be?
@_date: 2016-01-16 10:30:32
@_date: 2016-03-14 21:30:09
Yeah, that's really attractive compared to 88% for blocksonly.
@_date: 2016-03-15 09:37:28
I'm talking about block relay, not tx relay which is unaffected by both the relay network and thin blocks. Each tx in the block takes 2 bytes with the relay network, so a block with 4000 txs will be compressed to 8kb compared to 128kb with thin blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:33:19
Sure, but that just means it's a *small* sample, not an unrepresentative one.
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:26:10
It's not entropy, it's content, albeit content that is going over your head. We do need good communicators who can explain the ideas to less technical people. for example.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:53:14
The Chinese miners are all on board with 2MB BTW, so there's no reason to fear they'd veto a soft fork.
@_date: 2016-01-16 12:41:58
Well, I'd point out that fixing malleability in turn greatly helps LN, which is a real scaling solution. The scripting upgrade trick also allows lots of improvements we've been dreaming about to be released much more quickly and safely, including things like fraud proofs.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:48:46


Which might be never.
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:09:24


What do you mean by basically? They do sell hardware, just not to consumers.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:14:16
Could be. Or it could be some service layered on top of Bitcoin that's moving elsewhere, just like Storj intends to. Or maybe it's the effect of BitPay's decision not to subsidise tx costs anymore.
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:55:02
will there even be a bump fee button in 0.12 or does it only affect relay and block building policy?
@_date: 2016-01-01 14:48:11
That could be easily fixed by an additional cap of 2MB.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:38:51
2-4-8 and LN will come next.
@_date: 2016-01-01 21:09:44
If six months in you still don't have a clue why people are worried about changing the limit through a hard fork then it's no use talking to you.

They don't owe you anything.
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:52:47


If you seriously want a compromise, then propose a hard fork with a lead time of a year.
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:04:13
BIP 102 or BIP 101 won't help with that either. If you want to be able to deal with MOON! in 2016, you need orders of magnitude. For that you need algorithmic improvements, not block size increases.
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:05:00
I'm concerned about governments imposing blacklisting, especially on miners.
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:18:33
But of course, only small-block-Bitcoin will be Bitcoin, the other chain will be an altcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:35:44
I'm aware of the details. At 75% the new rules are enforced, but only for new blocks. At 95% old blocks are no longer accepted.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:33:05


In defence of Core's position though, some Chinese miners are really concerned about anything more than 2MB until the results of IBLT and weak blocks are in. Hard to schedule a hard fork until you have that information. You could leave it to a miners vote, or a series of votes, but I'm not sure everybody would like that.
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:07:46
Yes, traffic isn't constant, there are peaks and troughs. That does not mean capacity is insufficient during peaks however, as most txs do not have to be confirmed within one block.
@_date: 2016-01-09 11:31:41
If you rule out the answer in advance, there can be no discussion.
@_date: 2016-01-16 12:32:40


That includes the vast majority of Core developers.
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:45:05
Yeah, that must be why they're down-voting it. The numbers don't lie though.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:19:58
Straw man, no one is claiming hard drive space is the problem.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:40:05


I'm in favour of both (SegWit + 2-4-8 even), but a hard fork needs a lead time of about a year to do safely. And for Core 2-4-8 is also the next step. I wish they would schedule such a fork now, with a one-off vote at the end of the year, or a series of votes next year, and I don't understand why they haven't.


Actually, the people implementing those wallets have said it wouldn't be very difficult.
@_date: 2016-01-10 17:34:03
Yes, or a firm soft fork. I expect the next change will be 2-4-8 as a hard fork in early 2018.
@_date: 2016-01-24 11:01:06
Amazing. And all of it would become worthless should we change the PoW function.
@_date: 2016-01-09 09:24:44
Stop spreading misinformation. It's absolutely false that many of the core devs have said this. In fact I think none of them have.
@_date: 2016-01-09 09:25:38
Actually, that version did have transaction replacement, and it worked even if you did not bump the fee.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:31:08
No, not the miners, buyers of Bitcoin. If people won't buy the coins produced by a miner because they prefer the other fork, then the miner's coins will be worthless and his business will be unprofitable.
@_date: 2016-01-10 10:52:12
There isn't a BIP yet, but something like this will probably proposed next year, after IBLT and weak blocks have been developed and tested.
@_date: 2016-01-10 16:00:37
That's what happens in a 'firm' soft fork, but that's not what SegWit does. SegWit-enabled txs look like anyone-can-spend txs to old clients.
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:06:40
No, the idea is to do SegWit as a soft fork and then 2MB as a hard fork. If you want to do both as a hard fork, then you have to wait for both for at least a year.
And it isn't much cleaner as a soft fork. Let's leave these decisions to the experts, not armchair quarterbacks.
@_date: 2016-01-24 09:17:53
Even in combination with weak blocks?
@_date: 2016-01-01 15:59:55
@_date: 2016-03-14 08:10:06
I'm struggling with the root hash of the tx hash stack. How is this calculated? Is it the root of a Merkle tree, or maybe a hash of the concatenation of the elements? Is it possible to reconstruct the root from separately signed inputs? Your reply suggests it isn't, but then what is the point of supporting the flags? Of course, this is still an awesome technique even without them.
@_date: 2016-03-26 23:17:46
Note that the segwit branch adds two new types to support Segwit:
The new types are called "witness_v0_keyhash" and "witness_v0_scripthash". I believe only the latter will be supported initially, but you'd have to ask the developers to be sure.
@_date: 2016-03-29 16:49:00


At first you said


and after I showed this wasn't true you shifted the goalposts to continued growth:


In other words, you went from a specific event that we know did happen to speculation about an indefinite future.


A fee market will not allow more txs in total, it will prioritise some over others to make sure the most urgent ones go first. There are still peaks and troughs, and most txs aren't time critical.
If tx numbers keep growing then eventually it will stop to be possible to get first block confirmation for low value txs at a competitive price, but we aren't there yet, nor even particularly close to being there yet. Right now it is reliable, with unchanged policy it might not be a few years from now. But as you know there are two main proposals to raise the block size limit to 2MB while we continue to research more advanced solutions.


You were bitching about the Core roadmap.
@_date: 2016-01-10 14:29:41
I believe breadwallet is the  iOS wallet.
@_date: 2016-01-24 11:31:45
True, but it's still decisive: for soft forks only 5% is necessary for a blocking minority and they have far more than that. SegWit isn't going to be activated unless and until they change their mind.
@_date: 2016-01-16 15:56:31
By doing a hard fork to see what happens!
"Does he have 75% support or only 45%?" Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement I kinda lost track myself. But being this is a hard fork, the most dangerous kind of fork in the Bitcoin world and would blow your head clean off, you've gotta ask yourself one question: "Do I feel lucky?" Well, do ya, punk?
@_date: 2016-01-03 18:06:32
But people aren't doing that. The consensus among the miners seemed to be that anything over 2MB is dangerous before we know how effective things like IBLT and weak blocks are going to be. The preferred first step was 2MB, which is essentially what SegWit can give you through a soft fork. So it's not one side saying the block size needs to increase and the other saying it should say the same, but one side proposing doing it with a hard fork and the other with a soft fork.
@_date: 2016-01-19 20:49:17
Ah ok, thanks.

What you can do however is to make more txs fit into that same base block by moving the signatures elsewhere.

Maybe as an emergency temporary measure, but bypassing the normal P2P network increases centralisation still further. We're not at the point where such extreme measures are necessary.

If growth continues at this pace, then we still have several years. In the meantime SegWit will come online in Q1 or Q2 and 2-4-8 likely in 2018. Together with LN this will allow hundreds of millions of users. There is no crisis.

I agree, the question is one of timing. I think an unnecessary hard fork at short notice and over the objections of the vast majority of developers is inexcusably reckless. On the other hand, I'm totally in favour of a 2MB hard fork, or preferably 2-4-8, early next year. I think Core should be able to commit to that. See  Contentious hard forks and hard forks at short notice are dangerous things, let's not use them if we don't have to.

Nobody is opposed to bigger blocks, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The disagreement is over how fast blocks can grow safely and how fast they need to grow to avoid stifling Bitcoin.
The Core development team has agreed on a roadmap that includes a 2-4MB increase as a soft fork and things like IBLT and weak blocks that will make even bigger blocks safe. Some Chinese miners have expressed concern over anything larger than 2MB until the results of those improvements are in, somewhere around the end of the year. At that time a new hard fork can be scheduled, mostly likely a variant of 2-4-8, which will last us a long time.
Personally I believe we could afford to schedule a vote for 2-4-8 at the end of the year, with activation February next year. I think Core should be able to commit to that too. See  for what I'd like everybody to agree to.

Bitcoin without off-chain transactions scales quadratically. If we're optimistic and assume we have 1M Bitcoin users today, then to support 7B people, or 7000 times today, we'll need 7000 * 7000 = 49M times the network resources we need today.

No, that can't be it. First of all it's not about memory, but about bandwidth and latency, and secondly Chinese miners control a majority of the hashing power, so they'd be hurting themselves if they did this to hurt their Chinese competitors.

Where the heck do you get this nonsense? SegWit is up and running on a separate testnet already and might be released in May. No one is advocating that we wait another 2-3 years. And a hard fork would be the next step. It could be scheduled now with an activation a year from now, but it looks as if Core wants to wait a little bit longer and then go to 2-4-8, not just 2MB.
There is no controversy over a quick increase to 2MB, just over the way to do it. I don't understand why anyone would want to second-guess the vast majority of developers. If they disagree, they should explain clearly why they want a very dangerous hard fork at short notice.

No, in that case the average block size would be close to 1MB. It would be slightly less because a small percentage of blocks are empty because they are mined just after another block, before the miner of the new block has had the chance to do full validation.

My guess is that the attack was intended to generate that wave of negative publicity and that a lot of manipulation of the media was going on simultaneously.

If it's just a few redditors, then there's no risk. If the Blockchain Alliance and a few miners support it, it could be different.

Not quite. Any transaction can be replaced with a later version sent by the same sender, either maliciously or just for fee bumping, if the miner cooperates, either wittingly or unwittingly. Whether a tx is marked as replaceable or not doesn't matter, there is no known way to prevent deliberate tx replacement completely. Core's wallet doesn't allow it, but there's no way a miner can reliably detect it if a user is using a customised wallet.
What opt-in RBF does is to give a sender the opportunity to attach a warning flag to a tx signalling that the user reserves the right to replace it later. Only for those txs will the wallet allow the user to send replacement txs. This is safe, precisely because of the flag.
Recipients should check for the flag, and act accordingly. And note that this isn't really a new flag, tx replacement has been part of the protocol from the beginning and wallets should have checked for it anyway, and I believe some have done so for a long time.
Note that an opt-in enabled Core wallet will still not allow users to send txs that conflict with an earlier tx if that earlier tx did not have its opt-in flag set. In other words, opt-in Core makes it no easier to double spend, but does make it easier to bump fees safely.

Hmm, could be, but I don't find the analysis very conclusive. You could also say that channels that are maxed out in one direction allow larger payments in the opposite direction, which could also help with routing.

A telling question that demonstrates the utter ignorance and incompetence of the big blocks camp. Bitcoin's censorship-resistance depends on decentralisation. If the monetary incentives are aligned against decentralisation there is no hope of regaining it. It is not about guaranteeing anyone an income, it is about ensuring mining is so decentralised that there is little risk of collusion.
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:40:01
What matters is whether the threshold is met over a whole retargeting period, not over the past 2016 days. Right now we have 1861 CSV blocks, out of the required 1916, so while we're close, it will take more than just 4 more blocks.

No, it's not a cop-out at all and it will have absolutely no impact on zero conf. Kindly walk me through a scenario that makes it easier for someone to pull off a double spend if you can.
@_date: 2016-01-03 15:41:11
Blocks are about 60% full right now, and grew by 30% last year. Half of these transactions are &lt;$1 IIRC. This suggests we have at least a year, and probably several years before serious transactions start being priced out of the market, *unless Bitcoin goes through the roof*, perhaps around the upcoming halving. But if such an event happens, scaling to 2, 8 or 20 MB doesn't really help very much. What we need then is several orders of magnitude, which is what LN could give us. So if you're worried about MOON! in 2016, you should really be rooting for LN. And if you aren't, there is plenty of time left anyway.

@_date: 2016-06-08 18:52:25
(Skipping some points discussed on Twitter while your post was stuck in the mod queue for two hours...)
It's true that compression helps with both latency and bandwidth, but it's important to note that even though BIP-152 and RN both use some of the same tricks, they are optimised for very different use cases. BIP-152 aims to reduce bandwidth spikes that are inconvenient on some consumer networking hardware, while RN is specifically optimised for latency.
But I think I get your wider point, that whatever the goal, both RN &amp; BIP-152 reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent at the critical moment, during block relay, whereas your solution makes uses of parallelism and local validation.
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:05:23

@_date: 2016-03-15 14:46:41
It seems to me that thin blocks could be a good fallback option for IBLT and weak blocks, for the cases where they fail to compress effectively.
@_date: 2016-06-11 19:07:02
Yeah, but then they have to censor all SegWit txs and forego their fees. That's still only a minor incentive, so maybe they'll do that. In the extreme case they'll end up mining empty blocks.

@_date: 2016-06-10 14:45:52
Only if it is used to reduce bandwidth spikes (the same use case Compact Blocks targets, and solves more efficiently), but then it does not contribute towards raising the maximum safe block size because that's currently limited by the effect on latency.
Or, paraphrasing dts on Slack:
Xthin is robust against the attack because miners will never use it. And because miners will never use it, it won't help with scaling.
And even if bandwidth were the bottleneck (which it isn't, though it remains a constraint of course, just not the most constraining one at the moment), block relay only makes up about 12% of total bandwidth, so at best this could allow 12% larger blocks.

If raising the block size limit is as urgent as Peter and his friends claim, then you bet it will happen faster because people will have a strong financial incentive to use SegWit. And if it isn't as urgent, then it isn't a problem if it takes longer.

Some relevant quotes from the Cornell paper:


Conservative here means a conservative *upper bound*, in other words you certainly won't get anything bigger than this.


In other words, this identifies just one constraint, which may or may not be the currently most restrictive constraint, in other words, which may or may not be the current bottleneck.


The example they give (latency) is exactly what Core is saying is currently the limiting factor.


In other words, they point to the Relay Network and warn against exactly the kind of analysis Rizun has done in his blog post. Since miners do not directly use the P2P network, improvements to it do not immediately allow for larger blocks than we have today.
Given that cost-effective mining is currently not possible on the P2P network (or so I'm told), there is a good argument to be made that 1MB is too much already, because we want a system with a P2P network that directly supports mining. Of course, this does have to be balanced against the concern that a much lower limit would be very economically restrictive. Conceivably XThin does help here, maybe competitive mining over the P2P network would again be possible if we added XThin and restricted the block size to say 0.5MB. If true, that would still potentially be a valuable contribution, except for the fact that CB does the same thing better and without XThin's known vulnerabilities. It still wouldn't allow bigger blocks immediately, but it would mean that we are slightly less disastrously screwed P2P-wise than before, even though it's still bad.

How does being a good guy enter into it? As a channel is used more and more to make or facilitate payments in one direction, it gradually becomes less useful for further payments in the same direction because the maximum amount of those payments will steadily decrease. At the same time, it becomes more and more useful for payments in the opposite direction.

Blocktorrent does I think, but I haven't really looked at it in detail. As long as you validate the PoW of the block header you can probably safely start broadcasting chunks together with a Merkle path that shows they're part of the block corresponding to that header. I'm not sure how much this will help, if at all, but it seems like an interesting approach to investigate.

OK, let's try it another way. We could lower the fee for unbalanced channels and raise them for balanced ones, perhaps using some linear schedule. Is that the kind of thing you're thinking of? And what do we mean by balanced, is it 50% of the money locked in the channel for each party, or does it mean trying to spread your balances equally among all your channels? I'm guessing you mean the former.

It's like synchronising watches, its only purpose is to let miners start enforcing the new rules at exactly the same block height. This minimises losses for miners.

(skipping some points we discussed on Twitter while your message was stuck in the mod queue...)
It's true that making messages shorter helps with reducing latency, but sometimes it's a trade-off. For instance with weak blocks you send extra data periodically in order to minimise the data that needs to be sent when a block is announced.
While BIP-152 and RN share some commonality, they are both specifically tailored to one specific use case, BIP-152 is for minimising bandwidth spikes that are inconvenient on some consumer network hardware, while RN is optimised for latency.
But I think I get your wider point, that whatever the goal, both RN &amp; BIP-152 reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent at the critical moment, during block relay, whereas your solution makes uses of parallelism and local validation.

I'm wondering if it might be a good idea to have an interactive online review session. We could go through the consensus/P2P code, which isn't ridiculously long. People could ask questions, and if nothing else it would help document the whole thing.
I realise something similar was done in Zürich, before an audience of very qualified reviewers, but it's good to have more eyes on it. Even if it ends up being a session that mostly consists of devs explaining things, it might still trigger ideas in their minds and cause them to find previously overlooked imperfections.

Big deal. If fees rise substantially, that in itself is a success that will likely make the price go up (not that that should be the main concern). In time we'll be able to support more txs, so any buyers that were discouraged earlier can just jump on board later.

But there's also no incentive to actively avoid using it in the opposite direction. Sooner or later someone will want to make a payment in the opposite direction. And the more of the money locked in that channel is located on one end, the more txs will be able to squeeze through.
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:49:38
Very interesting, but I'm puzzled that it says the existing RN optimises for bandwidth, not latency. Surely it's the other way around, no? It also seems to miss the point that the existing Relay Network isn't meant for multi-hop scenarios.

Won't the market rebalance all by itself? A channel that's maxed out in one direction is perfect for making/facilitating payments in the other direction. Is the idea to set negative costs to make this go faster?
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:20:45
No, because HODL-ing doesn't take up any block space. What percentage of UTXOs is using SegWit isn't important for scaling, it's about what percentage of txs uses SegWit.
@_date: 2016-06-11 18:53:39
They wouldn't include the required hash in their coinbase, so upgraded nodes would see their blocks as invalid. This means that miners will not build on top of their blocks and since they have far more hashing power, they will outrun the incipient "Classic" chain, and all nodes including "Classic" nodes will follow the SegWit miners.

@_date: 2016-06-01 07:05:57


No, it is not. There is a concern that if the block size is increased too much it will make even fewer people run a full node, which is true. But the even bigger concern is related to block propagation delay. That is currently the limiting factor, the bottleneck, the one you will run into first. Addressing just the total bandwidth use (and even then only very modestly) doesn't improve the current bottleneck and therefore doesn't allow for *any* scaling.


No, the level of retardedness and dishonesty is.


No, they don't. This the reason for CB, check the BIP. When did anyone claim CB was for something else?

No, it's not. Even with 1MB blocks miners using the P2P network currently cannot compete against miners who are using RN, or so I'm told. This is a very bad situation, miners are basically forced to use a centralised network.


Don't patronise me.

They won't be orphaned. I thought you could trick them by sending an invalid CSV spend (say a perfectly good one that's just relayed early), but set me straight.

They will still happily accept them in blocks made by others.

The argument doesn't keep changing. There are various constraints that we need to keep an eye on. At the moment the propagation delay and switching time are the biggest concerns. This has been the case for about a year.
It's not so much Core's argument that keeps changing as r/btc's perception of it. If r/btc is your main information source, then you're exposed to garbled retellings of complicated arguments most technically unsophisticated redditors cannot understand mixed with vicious lies.

Most of the time you only need to embed a hash of something into the blockchain, the actual data can then be stored somewhere else. And often the thing you're taking the hash of is itself only a list of hashes of other data. In this way you can prove that data wasn't tampered with without storing every single bit in the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-01-01 14:54:49
We could even build in a one-off vote in December to allow the limit to increase. That would essentially be a hard fork scheduled a year in advance. Some miners have expressed strong opposition to going beyond 2MB before we know it's safe ("jumping out of a plane without a parachute"), but a single miner with 5% of the hash rate could still veto it in December. We could always schedule another vote later, but in this way we preserve the principle that hard forks need long lead times, while still scheduling a hard fork at the earliest responsible moment.
EDIT: Hmm, on reflection I think this would still be a soft fork.

No it did not, it said that (given current network infrastructure) anything bigger than 4MB would not be viable based only on propagation to nodes. It did not say 4MB would be fine or that propagation to nodes was the bottleneck.
XThin does not allow *any* scaling, as it has inferior latency compared to the fast Relay Network, which miners use today. In their claim that XThin "isn't vulnerable to" Maxwell's short id collision attack they had to argue that miners won't use XThin. Exactly, latency for miners is the bottleneck, not propagation to nodes, and that is why XThin won't help. The same is true for Compact Blocks by the way, which is why Core isn't presenting it as a solution to the latency problem.
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:28:10
The primary reason for SegWit is to fix malleability, which is something that will also enable LN, which is a scaling solution. It also happens to roughly double the number of tx that can be supported, all with a soft fork.
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:00:55
Yeah, I was thinking we'd already lost a day and it might take a bit longer before the 144-block average hits 95%, but we might indeed be making it today and therefore possibly a 95% 2016-block average this period. So four more weeks then. That still doesn't mean that people have to rush to upgrade in fear of being left behind. That's what the grace period is for, no one has to lose even a single block.
Our friend Tom Zander will have to get cracking to merge CSV though, or any miners still running so-called "Classic" will have their blocks orphaned. Last week or so he said there were no important BIP 9 soft forks coming up. We'll see about that!

Yes I have, and these are exactly the costs I'm talking about. If those costs weren't there, there would be no advantage to running a light node.
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:57:26
The risk isn't in the 2MB, and SegWit also does about 2MB. The risk is in doing a hard fork at short notice. As for the complexity: it does much more than increasing the maximum effective block size. It fixes malleability, fixes the quadratic hashing problem and introduces a new mechanism for upgrading the scripting system, all in a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:51:33
SegWit does increase the block size, contrary to what people have told you. There is no need for a hard fork. People who claim otherwise are simply trying to create a precedent so they can have unlimited increases later. It's hard to compromise if the other side insists on total victory.
@_date: 2016-06-14 16:19:36
Maybe they're afraid their blocks will be orphaned if they don't do this... It was already looking as if CSV would lock in even without their support, albeit with a slim margin, but this should clinch it.

No, latency is the biggest issue, and CB doesn't address that, nor is it meant to. Also, CB doesn't meaningfully reduce bandwidth, since tx relay takes about 88% of total bandwith.


Only if 4-8 MB is already pretty possible, which seems very unlikely.
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:45:33


No it doesn't, they have explicitly admitted they are trying to use it as a bargaining chip to force through a hard fork. There's nothing in SegWit that precludes a later hard fork. They just don't like it because it is coming from Core and because it doesn't force a contentious hard fork down people's throats.

Can someone explain why we need negative costs? Why would you want to rebalance your channels? If it is to make a payment to someone across a channel that is maxed out in the wrong direction, why not just find a route that does that?

It improves some aspects of the P2P network, but it doesn't address what's currently the bottleneck, so unfortunately it doesn't allow *any* further scaling.

Note that CB also doesn't allow any immediate scaling, as it too does not address the current bottleneck.

@_date: 2017-01-09 14:13:45


No it doesn't. It makes the meaning of a specific sequence of opcodes more restrictive. The sequence in question is a constant and an OP_TRUE that together have the same effect as a NOP. The result is a generalisation of the OP_NOP redefinition technique. The same generalised soft fork technique (invented by Gavin Andresen!) was used for P2SH.
Since this sequence was nonstandard (so most nodes didn't relay or mine them) and useless (anyone could have taken your money) before, this does not get in the way of any previous use of this sequence and therefore doesn't harm anybody. It merely allows consenting users to use a new type of tx that has suddenly become useful. People who don't want to use or mine such txs are free to ignore them.

In other words you are deliberately saying SegWit isn't a block size increase when you really mean it isn't a hard fork. That's dishonest.
SegWit is a block size increase (and much more). If you want a hard fork, come up with arguments for it, instead of spreading lies about SegWit.

It is already too high to allow profitable mining (!= hashing) on the P2P network. You have to use something like RN to be profitable, or so I'm told. This is not a desirable situation, in fact it means decentralisation is hanging by a very thin thread.
@_date: 2016-01-06 18:36:46


Wrong, I have not assumed it. In fact I have repeatedly stated that if anything it's sudden growth you should be worried about, not steady growth. And sudden growth can only be dealt with by something like LN, so if that's what you're afraid of you need LN, not blocksize scaling.
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:09:31
There are certainly full blocks, but on average blocks are only 60% full. Tradeblock's mempool rarely goes above 15MB, so if you pay a reasonable fee you'll not have to wait longer than three hours on average. For many txs that's more than good enough. The rest can use a higher fee.
@_date: 2016-01-10 17:38:05
What do you mean by a true block size limit? We can increase the number of txs that will fit in a block at the cost of increasing bandwidth.

A distinction without a difference. What matters is that more txs will fit into a block. The base block size is merely the size of the first "half" of the new block format, and that first half is backwards compatible.

The Ripple IOU model is still 100% supported, it's just that the new Ripple also has a new cryptocurrency. Also, the old model relied on centralised servers for book keeping, whereas the new model relies on potentially decentralised validators.

SegWit *is* already a compromise, but I think that if it's really scaling that people want (and not control, which is unacceptable) then we can have controlled on-chain scaling with extension blocks together with off-chain scaling approaches such as LN. But SegWit and LN need to happen first, and can happen very quickly.

@_date: 2017-08-26 16:45:46
If SegWit2x banned the other side, but not vice versa, then the other side would reach consensus with Satoshi's nodes, so I would have to say that the other side was Bitcoin. If the other chain died, then I would consider Bitcoin to have died. The other side might then be able to seize effective control of the brand, but it still wouldn't be legitimate.

Bigger blocks are already part of SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:06:36
It's not really fair to count only the time spent creating this particular block. On the one hand it is true that all the time they spent mining when they didn't find a block was wasted in retrospect, but the point is you cannot know that in advance. You have to take the bad with the good and if the few times that you find a block it is invalid, then you have wasted all your effort. I suppose the most reasonable estimate is the average block cost (total monthly costs including depreciation divided by the number of blocks found per month) times the percentage of blocks affected by this bug.
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:14:10


In the same way as it's done for SegWit, through an OP_RETURN in an output of the coinbase tx.

Because SegWit already gives us 2MB blocks with a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:41:44
It still follows compatible consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:00:53
If it uses compatible consensus rules, then it will synchronise with Satoshi's code (modulo bugs, resource requirements etc). A soft fork with a majority hash rate will synchronise with Satoshi's code, so yes, it will be Bitcoin. A minority soft fork would not, although it could become a majority later, in which case all unupgraded nodes would reorganise and follow it. A hard fork would not be Bitcoin.
Arguably that's not terribly workable for a currency, but Satoshi didn't define any process for changing the rules other than implicitly through soft forks. If we ever reach consensus for a hard fork, I think we should change the name. A prefix or suffix (New Bitcoin, Bitcoin Next etc) could be acceptable.
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:28:01
Mining is very expensive, they lost the electricity used to mine that block.
@_date: 2016-06-07 17:14:25
No, that's not the argument, after all Core is proposing their own 2MB fork. The argument is that soft forks are safer than hard forks, that hard forks at short notice are dangerous and that controversial hard forks are especially dangerous.

There's no harm in having two conflicting txs that both spend to an address you control. Nobody would be defrauded. EDIT: In fact, it doesn't even matter who the recipient is, both txs would be equally valid, spending the exact same amount of Bitcoin to the exact same address, from the exact same input. Sig hashing flags allow carefully controlled, deliberate malleability by design.
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:32:00
I was thinking they would inevitably be including invalid txs, but maybe that's not true. They'd have to filter SegWit txs though, which costs miners running "Classic" tx fees. And if the percentage of SegWit txs grows, they'll effectively be attacking the network.

Technical debt is a very important concept, but SegWit doesn't really add technical debt beyond what's needed for backward compatibility, which is only a handful of lines of code. And arguably, the new format is cleaner than the old, so it also reduces some technical debt. Either way, the net result is negligible.
And you can tell people complaing about the alleged technical either aren't competent or not sincere, since if you are going to complain about technical debt, there is so much more low-hanging fruit that none of the naysayers are complaining about. Core just removed a whole chunk of it and nobody noticed.

Not just a bit lower, it could be anywhere between 1MB and 4MB. That it's an upper bound for the safe size means that the safe size is definitely less than 4MB. We just don't know how much less. If you want something that's definitely safe, then you need a lower bound. 1MB might be such a lower bound. It could even be higher, but we need more investigation to know.
@_date: 2016-11-25 21:10:55
How is that not an answer? SegWit already gives us the benefits of a block increase, without the risks and disruption of a hard fork. Also doing a hard fork only adds disadvantages and no advantages.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:54:14


I don't believe this is what motivates them and I also don't believe it will eat into their fees.
It is true that LN is likely to be more suitable for lots of relatively small retail payments, which will therefore move away from the main chain. This will relieve fee pressure in the short run. That might indeed be unattractive to miners.
On the other hand, miners are in a position to restrict supply, so this is something that can address themselves. Also, as blocks fill up again, people can now afford to spend more on opening and closing channels, since the costs will be amortised over large numbers of LN txs. In the long run fees are likely to be greater than they are now.
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:39:33

@_date: 2016-11-25 23:44:14
One reason could be because even at 1MB the block size is enough to make most people prefer light wallets. But a lot of dramatic performance optimisations have been made over the past year, so a rough doubling of the average block size was considered acceptable. And since people were leaning towards 2-4-8 as a first step, a compromise was possible.

The consensus algorithm doesn't know about hard forks, so the concept of legality makes no sense here.

Sure, which is why I said *if* you base your decision to buy / sell / hold on it.

If you don't run nodes yourself, then you are trusting someone else's node, thus giving that node more influence.

Of course they will be part of the block, SegWit would be absolutely broken if they weren't. The witness part is linked to the non-witness part in the same way as the non-witness part is linked to the block header, through a Merkle root. It just so happens that the non-witness part has the exact same structure as an old-style block with just the information needed to update the UTXO set (what you call the WHAT and WHEN, though that's not an accurate description). This is what makes old nodes do the right thing, even though they don't see the witness part.

Further hard forks that increase the limit or a single hard fork that removes it altogether. Unlimited is an utterly unreasonable proposal. It's a big, fat fuck you to the development community.

The feerate of that tx is 0.00050349 BTC / ~~byte~~Kbyte. According to 21.com's fee estimator you currently need 0.0005 BTC / ~~byte~~Kbyte for immediate confirmation.

Such a tx would be considered valid but non-standard. It would be accepted in a block, but not during tx relay.
Malicious *blocks* are certainly possible, but they would be expensive to create. I'm not sure, but new nodes might ban nodes that relay such blocks. I recall some irc discussion that might be related. Pinging @_date: 2016-11-29 14:52:04

@_date: 2016-11-29 22:18:25
Soft fork means that unupgraded nodes will follow what the majority of hashing power does, in other words they will follow the most work chain.
Full nodes always follow the most work *valid* chain, a soft fork means that blocks that are considered valid by upgraded nodes are also considered valid by unupgraded nodes. This is the case when the new set of rules is stricter, such as when adding a new rule that didn't previously exist.

Why doesn't the hash rate simply grow to the point where it becomes marginally profitable?

Yes it does, it would be horribly broken if it didn't. It just doesn't store it in the part of the block that old nodes get to see, the part that is cleverly backwards compatible. But the two parts are cryptographically linked in the same way that an old-style block (=new style non-witness part) is linked to its header, through a Merkle root.

They wouldn't have to switch to trust the old miners, they'd have to switch to trust the new ones. And there is a highly motivated group of users who would never switch, and that group includes &gt;95% of all active developers. Depending on how quickly people started selling their bitcoins or altcoins either chain could either die quickly or readjust in time. If the old chain survives and has the support of the developers, then the new chain doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of usurping the name Bitcoin in the public's mind.

They could be done through extension blocks as a soft fork or as hard forks.
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:27:40
Exactly, and that is as it should be. People shouldn't be able to ram through a hard fork increase under false pretenses, especially if it opens the floodgates to other hard forks.
This is exactly why the big blocks camp is being so unreasonable, they are showing *zero* regard for the concerns of the development community. They want to ram through unlimited block sizes based on insufficient evidence and against substantial counter-evidence.
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:45:14
They can't validate just their own txs. It would be very nice if they could. LN will work under this model. Extension blocks or sidechains can work with this model.
Have a look at Bitcoin 9000, it outlines a way in which we can both have what we want: the ability to conduct on-chain txs without the need to validate everything if you're OK with reduced security or if you only use the main chain.
If you don't want reduced security, that's fine you can just restrict yourself to the main chain, and you'll have to pay higher fees for it. Since you apparently care about being able to validate it, you may be willing to pay those higher fees, especially since you can use LN for most txs.

No, there was a study by Cornell that said that 4MB was definitely unsafe and explicitly warned:
*Note that as we consider only a subset of possible metrics (due to diﬃculty inaccurately measuring others), our results on reparametrization may be viewed as upper bounds: additional metrics could reveal even stricter limits*


As does SegWit.


Nothing in SegWit precludes further scaling, on-chain or off-chain, through hard forks or soft forks.

@_date: 2016-11-26 11:03:52


Why would they care if it was done automatically and they didn't notice it? Having more security is better than having less.
But currently, I do notice. I have a monthly data cap of 6GB on my mobile phone, so I certainly won't run a full node on it. Also, the initial block download (and validation) takes a long time.
Now, I don't think it's important that people should be able to run full nodes on their mobile phones, but I'm just illustrating how the block size can have a serious impact on how many people run a full node.
As for desktop machines, now that we have pruning it's probably mostly the initial block download and usability that explain why relatively few people run a full node. IBD will be dealt with with Jonas Schnelli's patch to run Core in 'SPV' mode during the IBD, so there is hope. But if the block size becomes a lot larger, even that may not be a solution.


It would have been preferable to reduce the disadvantages of bigger blocks (such as the insidious effect on propagation delay) rather than not making it much worse as Bitcoin has recentralised a lot recently.


For next year I would expect some changes that will make txs smaller rather than blocks larger, but also discussion about further on-chain scaling and preparations for it such as weak blocks and other forms of mempool synchronisation. More importantly I expect to see LN, which will greatly reduce the load on the blockchain and also give safe instant confirmations.
But why do people even care about on-chain scaling rather than scaling in general, as long as it is trustless?
@_date: 2016-11-28 11:31:45


Yes, it is. Even at 1MB you can already have txs that take a long time to validate and quadratic growth is, well, fast.


Another free tip: you are way out of your depth here.
@_date: 2016-11-28 19:53:02
They are not saying up to 4MB is safe.

Fees are slightly higher than normal. If you are annoyed by the fees, consider whether your tx really needs to be confirmed in the next block. If your wallet doesn't make it easy to choose a better fee, switch to a better wallet.

My initial reply was to this claim:


I dispute that. The number of full nodes is directly related to the economic cost of running one, precisely contrary to KuDeTa's assertion. You are making my case for me by insisting those costs are real. Yes they are, and that's exactly why increasing them further will further discourage people from running full nodes, which means everybody will have access to fewer full nodes on the P2P network.
@_date: 2016-12-19 18:18:04


It did, but Ethereum's value system and that of its developers is different. And even then the old chain managed to survive, aided by their difficulty readjustment algorithm of course.


Perhaps, but then people still shouldn't go around saying that this is what Nakamoto consensus means. And it also doesn't mean we shouldn't fight it. And even if everybody in the world agreed William Shakespeare was really named Julius Caesar and vice versa, it still wouldn't be true...
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:49:42


Not so. A soft fork is one where unupgraded nodes will automatically follow a majority of upgraded miners, which is the case if blocks under the new rules are always also valid under the old rules, that is if the new rules are stricter. One bit of remaining ambiguity is whether having a majority of hashing power before activation is part of the definition or not. If it isn't then there can be such a thing as a minority soft fork. In either case such a minority fork would lead to a permanent fork in the ledger, with unupgraded nodes not following the minority.
I'll get back to your other points later.
@_date: 2016-12-01 14:20:51
What advantage would this give us over soft-fork SegWit?
@_date: 2016-11-03 13:41:05
The reason it was disabled was because it could easily lead to exponentially growing strings, imagine a whole bunch of OP_DUP OP_CAT instructions in a row. Elements restricts the result of a concatenation operation to 520 bytes.
@_date: 2016-12-19 14:34:57
The hash rate follows what people want, not the other way round. If people stop buying / hodling or start selling then mining on the new side of the fork can quickly become very expensive. Depending on the distribution of support and on how quickly the difficulty is adjusted this could lead to either one chain surviving or both.
@_date: 2016-11-02 02:22:03
The concept of the longest valid chain presupposes a notion of validity. Two miners with different sets of rules will build on different chains. Nodes will follow the miners that share the same set of rules. They will not say, hey that other chain has more hashing power, I'll change my definition of a valid tx.
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:13:48
This is similar to what BitFury has, no?
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:18:25


Yes, but that by itself is not good enough a reason for a hard fork. Also, if you still want to support old blocks and old txs, you still have to have some code for backwards compatibility, so it's not even clear it would mean a net reduction in technical debt.

In the same way that fraud violates it, by misleading people about the true facts.
@_date: 2016-12-19 14:27:17
Yes, that's exactly what it is. Given fixed rules, vote on the inclusion and ordering of txs. Nothing more, nothing less, and certainly not voting on hard forks.
Whether regular people still mine has no bearing on it, whether they even run full nodes has no bearing on it. Miners will not build on top of blocks they consider invalid, even if a majority considers them valid. Miners do not consult what other miners think is valid, they apply their own rules. The resulting consensus between miners and nodes that apply the same rules (or compatible rules in the case of soft forks) is what is called Nakamoto consensus.
There is nothing in Nakamoto consensus that is designed to coordinate hard forks. The only protocol-level support for evolution is version numbers and OP_NOPs for soft forking. I'd have to check whether the OP_NOPs were there from the beginning, but I believe they were.


And that's exactly what makes it fraudulent. Satoshi didn't propose any hard fork coordination mechanism through CPU voting in the whitepaper. I don't think he ever did.

Adding to what said:


It was also written for an entirely different purpose, namely to fix malleability, which BIP 109 doesn't. Increasing the effective block size is only a side effect. In addition to that it also fixes quadratic hashing and a seriously dysfunctional incentive structure that makes it more expensive to merge UTXOs than to split them. Even more, it implements signature-covers-value, which is of great advantage to hw wallets. It even adds a script versioning mechanism which will facilitate all kinds of new scripting features.
And it does all this as a soft fork!
In other words, it does much more than BIP109 and does it better in only twice the number of lines.
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:04:10


No, it absolutely isn't and the whitepaper makes it crystal clear. The rules are given, miners only vote on the inclusion and chronological ordering of txs. Read the damn whitepaper.
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:33:13


Because it would split the chain. Hard forks split the chain, meaning some nodes will follow the old chain and others the new chain. A soft fork (a tightening of the rules with 51% support) wouldn't split the chain, all nodes would still reach a consensus. A tightening of the rules without a majority (a minority soft fork if you will) would split the chain and would essentially be a hard fork. The most important difference with a straight up hard fork would be that with a minority soft fork the split will be healed if and when the tightening of the rules reaches majority support later.

You can't compete with VISA using big blocks. What we need is more intelligent algorithms and extra layers, not brute force and huge blocks.

They're roughly equal, so little that it hardly matters. In addition to being irrelevant, it's dwarfed by the advantage of being a soft fork.
If we could have done SegWit right from the beginning, whispering into Satoshi's ear, then we could have done it marginally more cleanly than today. This is true with either a hard fork or a soft fork, since we have to deal with old blocks in either case.

There's no such thing as a hash signature. You're imagining that the term 'longest valid chain' has meaning without a prior agreement on all the details of what fields a tx has, what signature hashing system is used, what kind of elliptic curve is used, what the block reward schedule is, what the maximum block size is etc etc. That's simply not the case. Without any rules to interpret it a block is just a bunch of bytes.
Bitcoin nodes have all these rules hard-coded into them, and have had them since the beginning. Now, you can certainly exempt the block size limit and maybe some other parameters from this, but what you are doing then is no longer Nakamoto consensus. It is also no longer guaranteed to reach a consensus with older nodes.
@_date: 2016-12-15 13:32:31

I think a proposal that only does a HF to 2MB is unacceptable. That offers nothing over SegWit, which does the same thing with a soft fork. Doing that would mean a total capitulation to bad guys playing politics.
If there is to be a non-emergency HF, it should satisfy at least the following conditions:
 * it cannot reasonably be done as a soft fork
 * it includes as much cleanup as possible (Merkle tree construction, extranonce, difficulty adjustment bug, perhaps there's more), provided that actually provides a net benefit, given you still need to support old blocks
 * it includes HF warning mechanisms
 * it makes the difficulty adjustment more rapid to make future contentious hard forks more difficult
Forks to increase the block size should
 * be based on SF SegWit, and be activated only after SegWit
 * meaningfully go beyond 2MB
 * but only at a safe rate
 * after things that make larger blocks safer have been implemented (more efficient tx relay, mempool synchronisation, perhaps UTXO commitments) 
 * after further changes that allow you to make txs shorter such as Schnorr and sig aggregation have been implemented
 * with a long lead time
 * with overwhelming consensus
A hard fork to ~8MB through linear growth over a number of years seems possible.
But even that is probably better done through extension blocks.
I think the big block people need to take a step back and ponder what it is that they want. I think they want greater tx capacity and have simply been misled into believing that 1) on-chain is the only way to do it and 2) on-chain can only be done through hard forks. Neither of these is true.
If they really want on-chain growth, they should focus on extension blocks, not hard forks.

Au contraire, Nakamoto consensus is enforced by all nodes. The 'valid' in 'longest valid chain' means valid according to the detailed rules of Bitcoin, including the block size limit.
Bitcoin isn't like the US legal system, where you have a set of laws and a constitution that specifies how those laws (and even the constitution itself) may be modified. Instead you have one more or less fixed body of laws without a built-in mechanism for modifying itself.
Within that system you can reach a consensus on the selection and ordering of txs. The systems of laws itself must be predetermined through some other mechanism however.

@_date: 2016-12-18 18:26:00
The current consensus algorithm is not the longest chain, but the longest *valid* chain, according to a given definition of validity. A hard fork means changing that definition. There is nothing in the protocol to coordinate changes in the definition of validity. Majority voting doesn't enter into it. A hard fork can be activated with a majority vote, but it will have no effect on unupgraded nodes. They will happily continue to enforce the old rules and reach a consensus with other nodes that do.
We agree that a lasting fork is (probably) not something that's wanted. Or at least, lasting disagreement over which branch is the real Bitcoin. With a hard fork that's easy to say, the original unupgraded branch is the real one.

There are (at least) two types of consensus: consensus on the chronological order of txs and consensus on the rules for validity. The former is established through technical means in Nakamoto consensus. The latter is a purely social construct that need not even reach full consensus, as several competing systems can and do exist.
@_date: 2016-12-08 12:48:55




No they are not, they are technical terms with fairly precise meanings.


There's very little risk involved with SegWit. It introduces a new tx type which you can ignore if you don't like it.


I only mentioned that because you claimed it was implemented and fully tested.


No, you still have to support the old format, at least for older blocks.


It doesn't fully remove malleability, but what I meant was that it removes sequence numbers for no good reason.

Compromising and agreeing on an unnecessary hard fork for political reasons is not only silly, it actually would mean total surrender for the side that wants to keep Bitcoin free from strongarm tactics. It could by definition not be a compromise.
I think it is time to get rid of the focus on hard forks. What the angry big block people want is more on-chain tx capacity, not necessarily a hard fork. We could agree to a compromise that leads to the equivalent of 8MB old-style blocks without needing a hard fork.
I don't think that would be terribly controversial as people were leaning in that direction already with 2-4-8.

Like so many people you misunderstand or misrepresent Nakamoto consensus. It doesn't define validity, it merely reaches consensus on the selection and ordering of txs, given a fixed definition of validity. Nakamoto consensus never was about choosing a set of rules, the rules were laid down in advance by Satoshi.
*"We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent."*
@_date: 2016-12-19 14:32:45


No, they can confiscate other people's altcoins, not their Bitcoins. There is nothing magical about 51% hash rate support that will suddenly make the altcoin into Bitcoin. All nodes not following the proposed new rules, including any nodes running Satoshi's code, will happily continue to follow the old rules.
@_date: 2016-11-19 02:39:37
No, they are still in the chain. SegWit introduces a new block format that consists of two parts, a witness part that old nodes do not get to see and a non-witness part that they do see. Not only is it cleaner to make this separation, it is cleverly designed in such a way that old nodes will do the right thing if they interpret the non-witness part as an old-style block full of valid but sometimes non-standard txs. This is what makes this a soft fork.
But make no mistake, to new nodes the two parts of the new-style blocks are as securely linked to each other as a block header is to its set of txs. SegWit even uses the same mechanism for this, a Merkle root. Without this secure link SegWit would be horribly broken.

When you hard fork you have two different lands with two different laws of the land. Having a majority is meaningless. You said a 51% was 'legal'. That has no real meaning, as all forks regardless of the level of support are legal.


AFAIK the only hard fork there has been was unintentional and quickly undone. The other forks we have had (P2SH, CLTV, CSV etc) were soft forks.

@_date: 2016-11-25 17:07:44


BS. Just because the witness section isn't visible to old clients doesn't mean it's not there. It holds data and takes up bandwidth and storage, and needs to be validated. Subtleties in the serialisation do not translate to 'not real'.


We'll see.

@_date: 2016-11-01 11:04:09


No there wasn't. From the paper itself:
*Note that as we consider only a subset of possible metrics (due to difficulty in
accurately measuring others), our results on reparametrization may be viewed
as upper bounds: additional metrics could reveal even stricter limits.*
In other words, they didn't say that 4MB was safe, they said anything larger than 4MB should (currently) be regarded as unsafe.
@_date: 2016-11-16 19:34:21
Which is only recently. P2SH predated ASICs IIRC.
@_date: 2016-11-26 12:07:53


Weak blocks are a way to make normal ("strong") blocks propagate more quickly after they've been found. Miners broadcast blocks that meet a lower PoW threshold, so they may might arrive every minute instead of every ten minutes. Others can then already pre-validate them and when the real block comes along they only need to send the nonce and a reference to the weak block they are basing the new block on. This information will propagate far faster than a full block and can also be validated much more quickly as most of the work has already been done.
This does mean more CPU and bandwidth use in total, but lower propagation delays even with large blocks. And propagation delays are one of the limiting factors on block size.
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:42:50


Concern trolling by someone who is unqualified to make that judgement. FYI this is exactly how P2SH and the other soft forks were done. And not that it should matter, but soft forks were introduced into Bitcoin by Satoshi himself.
@_date: 2016-11-07 11:36:36
Exactly, but there's even more to it than that. There are actually good conceptual reasons for separating the witness and non-witness parts of a tx. Malleability is a good one, and the signature hashing needs to blank out signature scripts too. The new way is actually cleaner than the old.

*The original vision to control changes to Bitcoin’s software was through the power of decentralized decision-making. Specifically, end users were supposed to decide which version of the software they would run, and in doing so, the majority would determine which features and functionality would be incorporated into the network. This worked quite well for the first several years of Bitcoin’s existence.*
This was never the vision, it's the same twisting of Satoshi's words in the whitepaper that the BU people are mendaciously pushing.
@_date: 2016-11-01 23:22:40
It was introduced through a soft fork, which was acceptable to a majority of the hash rate. Such a soft fork must be coordinated through some other mechanism, not through the Nakamoto consensus mechanism itself. In the case of the block size limit Satoshi's decision was enough to get enough people to upgrade.
Soft forks only work when making the rules stricter, not when making them looser. The same mechanism cannot be used to raise the block size limit. It would permanently fork the chain, although it is conceivable one fork might eventually die. In fact, fear of the new fork dying (or the old one not dying) is probably what has so far kept people from going through with their planned hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:43:49

A soft fork tightens the rules, which falls under "inclusion and chronological ordering of txs". If a group of users disagrees with the majority of the hashing power, then they can start a rival soft fork (==rival tightening of the rules), but that would effectively be a hard fork unless and until they eventually regained majority support.
I'm not saying that all soft forks are good (some are outright 'evil'), but if they get majority support then they *are* Bitcoin, simply by virtue of Nakamoto consensus, which selects the most-work *valid* chain. A 51% hard fork is simply an altcoin.

No, it would be totally incompatible, unlike xthin which is both inferior and vulnerable to attack, but which can be run alongside CB.
If we ever use soft fork extension blocks for scaling, it might be worth it to redesign the tx format while we're at it. Either by allowing only new txs into the extension block, or by allowing both formats. The latter would be less disruptive of course.

Huh? Old nodes validate only the OP_TRUE, which will succeed even if the witness is invalid.

There is no concept of the longest valid chain without prior agreement on what constitutes validity. Nodes with different rules will not reach consensus. Forks with different rules can coexist indefinitely. Nakamoto consensus is a mechanism for reaching a consensus on the selection and ordering of txs given prior agreement on the rules for validity. It is not a mechanism for choosing what the rules are. Every node owner gets to choose what software he installs, regardless of what miners are doing.

No, most proof of work *valid* chain. The paper explicitly says nodes will not follow or build on invalid blocks, no matter how much proof of work is spent on them.
Think about it, how could they even adjust to new rules (at least those that cannot be enforced by stricter inclusion) that they don't even know about?
The whitepaper isn't talking about distinguishing the real Bitcoin from wannabe competitors, as that at best happens in people's minds. How could he even be doing that, long before people had dreamed up competing altcoins or the notion of a contentious hard fork.
No, he is talking about the actual algorithm that the system he invented, Bitcoin, uses. And that system, now known as Nakamoto consensus, works by applying a fixed and preset set of rules for validity and choosing the most-work chain that obeys it.

No, not up to 4MB blocks, they are saying 4MB is definitely too much. Can't you read? They said:

The initial block download is a bigger problem than storage space though, since with pruning enabled you don't need a lot of disk space. Fortunately work is being done on a patch that would allow a Core node to run with simplified verification during IBD.
@_date: 2016-12-15 11:52:16


Satoshi's words do not relate to choosing consensus rules, they relate to "using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions". The "voting" relates to a chronological order of the transactions, not to the rules that govern their validity. Those rules are fixed, and not open to voting.
Anyone is free to come up with a competing system with different rules, and even flexible rules determined by voting. Such a system may even gain significant market share, possibly even more than Bitcoin. But it would never *be* Bitcoin.

Ah yes, but not as a soft fork. And since SegWit already addresses the things FT ostensibly seeks to address, only better and without breaking things, this would be as useless as replacing SegWit with a 2MB hard fork.

Do you think there is anything questionable about filtering out txs that are *known* to be intended to clog up the system? To me that's like saying there's nothing wrong with theft.

@_date: 2016-12-20 13:09:38
That's not really true, no one is really forced to use SegWit. If you don't want to send SegWit txs, don't. If you don't want to receive SegWit outputs, don't create SegWit addresses. If you don't want to mine SegWit blocks, mine old blocks. It is true that there will be a financial incentive to use SegWit.

True, but there's not much of a reason not to scale the block size limit as bandwidth improves on the basis of realised or slightly extrapolated gains. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 10:51:15
I suspect that +4MB/yr would be safe for a very long time to come, as multi-GB blocks will likely become safe and that would take hundreds of years at that rate. It seems more likely to me that either something like treechains will make a limit less important or we'll decide to increase the limit faster than 4MB/yr eventually.
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:41:57
The risk is limited to the sidechain. At worst, you lose your locked-up coins.
@_date: 2015-08-13 08:38:20
I agree that it is somewhat risky because it's a large jump, although I don't expect major problems. But because the negative consequences could be very large even if the probability is low, it is wise to be cautious.
It is true that BIP102 only kicks the can down the road, but I think that is a good thing, for a number of reasons.
First of all, the atmosphere is getting very toxic, and the lemmings are well on their way towards pushing us into a possibly disastrous hard fork. We need more time to get reliable information out to the community to counter the irresponsible rabble-rousing by Gavin and Mike. We also need time to deploy and demonstrate LN. Seeing the impact of the reward halving on the hash rate and tx fees will also help.
In addition, a small fork soon would give us safe practice with something we need to get good at, namely repeated hard forks to increase the limit as network technology improves. These improvements are hard to predict, as is the growth of tx volume, so I don't think it's possible to grow the block size safely with a fixed algorithm.
Finally, a small increase soon would help alleviate the perception of obstructionism on the part of the core developers. I personally think it's outrageous and dishonest propaganda, but the perception is out there and it's harmful.

Code. When you move coins to a sidechain, you lock them up on the main chain and present SPV proof of that to the sidechain, which then accepts them 1:1. The same happens when you move them back. NPV proof of locking coins on the sidechain is accepted as sufficient authorisation to withdraw the same number of bitcoins on the main chain.
@_date: 2015-08-17 23:03:25
Sure, there is no way around that. Of course, legitimate transactions are still remembered by the node that sent them, which can rebroadcast them, perhaps with a higher fee.

@_date: 2015-08-02 15:06:44


Yeah, that's the whole point. It keeps the blockchain small, anyone can run a full node and verify everything on that small blockchain. The bulk of txs would take place off-chain, with only sender, recipient and any intermediate nodes verifying the txs. You'd no longer have to verify and transmit everyone else's coffee purchases in order to validate your own txs.

While that may be part of the reason, it seems more probable to me that this is driven by VC-backed ventures who need large and rapid growth soon to succeed. VCs don't care about decentralisation, they're just in it to make money. This would also explain the unseemly haste to raise the limit.
The drive for larger blocks soon could also include those who feed off the whole VC circus, such as speakers, consultants, vendors of systems like KYC solutions, multisig solutions etc. They might not even need large and rapid growth, just the appearance of being able to handle it.

Repeated hard forks would be my preferred option, but that's apparently not what they're talking about. This is hardcoded growth to 8MB in four years, only they are proposing to do it smoothly, not with a step function. Well, blocks are discrete, but it would be a long series of tiny increases rather than three doublings.
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:41:25

The median might be a better choice if we're trying to increase decentralisation.
@_date: 2015-08-02 09:54:34
I agree, though I would want to see a much smaller increase first, as with BIP 102. Agreeing to a simple increase in the block size now does not mean you'll object to further increases later. Disagreeing with automatic increases does not mean disagreeing with further "one-off" increases. Heck, even disagreeing with automatic increases now doesn't mean disagreeing with automatic increases for all eternity.
I take insisting on automatic increases rather than being willing to compromise, and being willing to accept that if the block size is to rise several orders of magnitude it's going to take multiple hard forks, as evidence of bad faith.
@_date: 2015-08-02 19:51:23
I'm not the one quoting anything as scripture...
My stance is that there is no urgent need to increase the block size as it will be several years before fee pressure will become problematic. If that's not the case, I believe we can quickly achieve a consensus on an increase a la BIP 102.
There is a very real risk of increasing the limit too fast, which is why I want to be cautious. That said, I think we could survive an increase to 8MB, maybe more, 32MB being a natural cutoff point as that was the original limit.
In the longer term, I think the limit can be raised substantially, by several orders of magnitude, as networking technology progresses. I think most people in the world will one day have access to Gb networks and possibly something very much faster than that, I just don't know how long it will take.
However, we don't know by how much things like LN and OT, and further-off things like tree chains, can reduce the need for bigger blocks at the same transaction volume. We also don't know how fast Bitcoin usage will grow.
Given these concerns and uncertainties I think it is impossible to devise a simple algorithmic schedule for the block size limit that grows fast enough to be economically safe and slowly enough to remain decentralised. In fact we can't even be sure it is possible to do both at the same time. And if a simple algorithmic schedule is impossible, we're going to have to do it through repeated hard forks. Given the danger of hard forks, we had better get good at them. In particular, we had better get good at avoiding contentious hard forks (the most dangerous kind) by getting good at building consensus. And what better way of getting good at these things than through practice, by going through several small increases and other forks in the next couple of years.
Given all these things and given the level of concern in the community and the dangers of a contentious hard fork I think it would be wise to reach agreement on a quick but small increase this year, in other words something like BIP 102, but including a vote by miners. It will be small enough to avoid a real threat to decentralisation and will at the very least buy us some time while we work on algorithmic solutions to scaling Bitcoin.
In addition I would like to see all the major players commit to a regular (yearly?) review of the situation. As far as I'm concerned anything up to 32MB is acceptable in the next six years as long as it's done gradually and uncontentiously through repeated hard forks.
@_date: 2015-08-04 15:45:40
I don't think you'll find a lot of opposition to one order of magnitude, rather than four as Gavin is proposing. And even that might get support if it was done stepwise, on the basis of actual rather than projected increases in residential bandwidth.
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:39:33
That's certainly true, but my concern was that that the behaviour of miners could be enough to make people jump ship. I'm also concerned that the larger branch of the fork will 51% attack the smaller branch as has happened with some altcoins.
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:07:09
Ok, I was thinking of software wallets.
@_date: 2015-08-27 13:07:08
I don't think an adaptive algorithm can ensure either that ordinary users will be able to run a full node or ordinary consumers can afford to do most of their payments in Bitcoin because it wouldn't have access to the required information. I think it suffers from the same problem as trying to create a coloured coin that is algorithmically pegged to the USD.

Yes, of course I'm familiar with pruning, and yes, my concern is more with bandwidth than storage. But if you do all txs on-chain, then you have to broadcast them first.

Yeah, but you could say the OP is right if you take transactions to mean real world transactions ("cups of coffee") rather than on-chain Bitcoin transactions. And LN will help bring in large numbers of real world transactions, so it will actually help secure the network.

It does not provide protection in a straightforward way. Initially  greater adoption will not meaningfully increase political clout, while it will meaningfully increase the threat Bitcoin poses to the powers that be. That is more likely to increase the threat of a government crackdown / attempts to subvert Bitcoin without making Bitcoin more able to resist it. As a consequence, it will intially make things much worse before making it better.
Right now we have 171,529 subscribers, maybe we have something like 250,000 people worldwide who care strongly about Bitcoin and would let it influence their vote. Even 100 times as many users worldwide would still mean a tiny, politically uninfluential group of voters.
The reason governments have not shut down Bitcoin yet like they did with Liberty Reserve is that 1) it's not a threat yet and 2) it's too difficult to shut down easily. Something like Liberty Reserve could be taken down by mere bureaucrats following existing laws, while shutting down Bitcoin would require highly intrusive new measures that are incommensurate with the actual threat Bitcoin currently poses, and would likely not be accepted by the population in liberal democracies.
Also don't forget that as more and more people adopt Bitcoin, they will care less about it than the early adopters, in large part because they have a lower financial, so even if we had a thousands times as many users, only a small fraction of them would care as strongly about it as people here on do.
And make no mistake, if Bitcoin is successful, it will draw the attention of governments who will feel threatened by it. If successful, Bitcoin represents the greatest transfer of wealth and power in history. There is no way that the powers that be will simply accept this without trying to stop or co-opt it.
While Bitcoin will certainly enable a lot of wealth creation, it will not by itself make everyone on this subreddit wealthy through wealth creation, such effects can only be achieved through wealth transfer, which is not going to be popular with large and powerful sections of the population.
If we are to withstand the onslaught, we need to be prepared to withstand it before we grow too much, not afterwards.

Moore's law does not apply to bandwidth and may not hold for another 20 years even for computing power.


Not sure what you're saying here, unless you meant "you can**'t** say". I'm not claiming BIP101 won't work with 8GB 20 years from now (it very well might), I'm simply disputing *your* claim it has been rigorously tested. There have merely been limited tests.

It's a safe series of increases. People are optimistic that 8MB will be fine, but they want to do it in steps just to be sure. Nobody is worried that 2MB will break stuff, but if it shows signs of straining the system, then that's a useful early warning. Personally I think we can do a doubling every year, not every two years.
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:40:10
It was added specifically in order to gain consensus. We can't and don't need to predict the future beyond five or ten years. The 32MB limit is an excellent interim measure. Remember, you can't get a consensus if you won't agree to anything that doesn't grant you victory.

Tor is slow because it has to forward traffic over many hops and because there is a small number of exit nodes. P2P Bitcoin traffic doesn't require a large number of exit nodes. If the bandwidth of the individual links scales, so will Tor.

They should leave it and set up a rival project and not sabotage the older project.

We're not sacrificing anything by holding off on your reckless maximalist position by doing nothing, or as a compromise doing BIP 102. If there were enormous urgency, or if we had only one chance, then that might be very risky, but then again the same would be true of the alternatives. But fortunately there is no such urgency and we'll have plenty of chances to get it right.

I agree mining is a much bigger vulnerability right now, but that doesn't mean we don't need to worry about nodes running in people's homes too. I hope mining can be redecentralised, perhaps through things like 21 Inc style microminers. If not, we're in big trouble. Maybe we are.
@_date: 2015-08-28 12:26:51


I'd prefer that too. I'd like it even better if it started with faster, yearly doublings up to 8MB, then two years until 16MB and another four years until we hit 32MB. This could be combined with the BIP 103 idea of having continuous gradual growth rather than a step function.

Tor is not the big problem people think it is.
While it's absolutely necessary to be able to run a full node 1) at home and 2) behind Tor (or I2P or something similar), 2) is not spectacularly more restrictive than 1). If the block size stays within what can be reasonably used on a PC with median bandwidth without Tor, then we'll be fine. Reasonable use already includes not maxing out your connection or significantly impairing the user experience of the connection for other purposes.

In other words, they disagree about the how and when, they do not disagree about the desirability of supporting much higher tx volumes. Their preferred solution is to let things scale as much as possible with LN and only increase the block size as networking technology improves.

@_date: 2015-08-02 12:05:48
Two points:
- The capacity of the Tor overlay network will scale with that of the underlying internet.
- Not everybody needs to run through Tor, just a sufficiently large group so governments won't bother.
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:47:42
We'll see if we can indeed deploy a hard fork quickly if there is a consensus for it, which affects the argument made by Gavin and Mike that there is no time to lose.
We'll see if block sizes will immediately rise to fill the 2MB as some fear, or whether relaying nodes and miners will filter out spam transactions.
If nothing else it will buy us some time before the dramatic events proponents of a higher block size limit prophesy come to pass. That time will allow us to judge how much of an effect things like LN and OT will have as well as what happens to tx fees as blocks grow and the block reward is halved.
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:28:21
If they want to follow Mike and Gavin into the Dunning Krugerrand then they are free to do so.


Compromise is a two-way street. Giving in to your maximalist position is not a compromise. BIP 102 is. When we have more evidence after that, further compromises are possible.
Right now the Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement (look it up) for the small blocks side is no increases without a hard fork. There's no way you're getting a consensus on reckless changes. If you want consensus, you're going to have to compromise and try to achieve your goals gradually. If not, then a hard fork is *your* BATNA.
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:57:15
Why aren't they working to arrive at a compromise? I wonder if it is because they are behind the push for bigger blocks, with Hearn and Andresen acting as spokesmen.
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:35:10
Helpful blog post.
A couple of points I'd like to add:
- The median may be a better yardstick than the average.
- We cannot extrapolate too far, five years is reasonable, ten is iffy, more than that is unreasonable.
- Studying existing technologies shows that there can be tremendous advances.
- In particular [Optical fiber]( allows such enormous bandwidth that other parts of the system will be the bottleneck.
- Depending on local circumstances (population density, soil type, newly built vs existing housing) the cost of upgrading to fiber can vary greatly.
- While upgrading can be expensive, even partially upgrading to fiber allows you to increase the bandwidth over existing legacy copper telephone / cable TV cabling in areas that have them.
 * [Hybrid fibre-coaxial]( allows Gb networking over cable TV networks.
 * [Fiber to the x]( is a similar approach using telephone cabling.
- The closer the fiber network is to your home, the faster the connection. This is traditionally called the "last mile", but there can be real differences in both cost and performance depending on whether it's the last couple of miles, the last mile or the last couple of hundred yards.
 * [WiMAX]( supports Gb short-range wireless networks.
 * [G.fast]( allows Gb networking over telephone cabling up to 500m.
 * The [DOCSIS]( standard allows Gb networking over cable TV cabling.
- SpaceX recently received a $1B investment by Google to develop a low earth orbit constellation of satellites that could bring Gb networking to basically anyone with a satellite dish, including in rural areas, albeit from a centralised provider.
**Bottom line: there can be little doubt Gb networking will eventually be available to almost everybody on the planet, and within ten to twenty years in the developed world.**

No it isn't, the intent is for there to be millions of LN nodes. It's more like a P2P mesh than a hub-and-spoke model. A LN node should be as easy to run as an ordinary full node. It makes no more sense to call a LN node running in a person's home a third party than an ordinary Bitcoin node.
And if large hubs do appear, why should the be more objectionable than large Bitcoin mining farm that can only run in a datacenter?
@_date: 2015-08-03 05:53:40
There are other centralisation concerns with that proposal. But I think 8MB would not be disastrous even without it. Much more than is necessary, but not disastrous.
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:47:49


No, they do not. Increasing the block size limit is not the only way to enable much higher tx volume.

@_date: 2015-08-18 20:27:01


That would be good, but BIP 102 (a quick one-off doubling to 2MB to buy us some time) is even more interesting precisely because it does relate to the block size limit. I know of no reasonable grounds for people on either side to object to this as a first step.
Whatever else we decide to do eventually, let's start by doing BIP 102.
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:01:53

(Gubatron and I earlier had a discussion about this on Twitter in which I pointed out that an adaptive mechanism would be no less controversial than Gavin's proposals because waiting time says nothing about the maximum block size the network can support without becoming centralised. It does certainly address the concerns of those who are concerned about the block size limiting tx rates, but that is easier to address by simply removing the cap altogether. The 'concession' of limiting it to a median isn't in fact a concession, just a complication.)
There's no such thing as a global mempool, so this is not an objective rule and each node will have ~~their~~ its own value of the median. Such a rule can therefore not be used in the consensus code.

@_date: 2015-08-02 10:01:58


No, that's precisely what they're trying to avoid. The goal is to have millions of ordinary people running nodes (full Bitcoin nodes + LN nodes) from their homes.
If anything it's the big blocks side that is turning Bitcoin into something more palatable to large investors who don't want to have to worry about governments stepping in and damaging their investment. They'll be happy to compromise core properties of Bitcoin, like decentralisation, censorship-resistance and trustlessness, in order to make money.
Gavin doesn't even deny that you won't be able to run a full node behind Tor from your home if you live in a country where a government decides to crack down on Bitcoin. He disingenuously suggests the solution is to run your node in a datacenter in a country with a more friendly attitude (assuming there are any) for only $10/month. As if the dollar cost was the main obstacle to doing this, when very clearly the whole point of running a full node is having full control over it, something that's completely nullified by running it in a datacenter.
It's this blatant disingenuity that really bothers me.

The point is more that sufficiently large blocks and full nodes running from people's homes are incompatible, quite independently of whether you use Tor.

Guy doesn't know what he's talking about, ignore him.


It does no such thing and I dispute that we know that frequent increases will be necessary. It is too soon to bake in 20 years of scheduled increases when there is so much uncertainty about how much block space is actually needed to serve X billion people, how quickly Bitcoin will grow, how much bandwidth is acceptable from a decentralisation perspective and how quickly that number will grow through technological progress.
Also, if you think there are too few developers, get off your backside and start helping out or stop yelling from the sidelines telling people who are doing all the hard work what to do.


There is very little evidence that the low information morons who make up most of the community are capable of doing this without ruining the core properties of Bitcoin any more than democracies have been able to institute sound money and limited government.


I've seen zero willingness to compromise from Gavin. The 20MB and 8MB proposals are out the window, and now he's proposing automatic increases to 8GB.

Don't forget taxes and other redistribution schemes. "Ah, but the economic majority will never go for such changes". That's what the early cypherpunk idealists thought about censorship-resistance, until they were swamped by the much larger numbers who came later, attracted by the promise of riches.
To the people who want to ram through a contentious fork: don't forget that you are only a very tiny part of the world's population. If Bitcoin grows as fast as you hope, and if a simple majority (or even a 75% supermajority) can change the rules, then you can forget about the 21M limit. You will represent a much smaller fraction of the Bitcoin-owning population when that happens than cypherpunk idealists do today. Your early, "unfair" gains, as the supermajority will call them, will be taxed, redistributed among miners or demurred away.
If this isn't stopped, it will merely show that Bitcoin has failed. It will call into question whether it is possible to construct an impartial global ledger governed by mathematics alone, not the whims of men. If no one else does it, then at least the academic CS community will have the integrity to point this out as well as the credibility to find a ready audience in the media. What will that do to the Bitcoin price? I think people need to ask themselves whether their plans for Bitcoin can survive a drop to $1. If you're sympathetic to the cypherpunk ideal, the answer is yes.

I don't foresee big problems with 8MB blocks either, but I'd like to do it in three doublings.

Why two nodes? And why fairly large blockchains? The whole point of LN is that you need a much smaller blockchain to support the same number of transactions.

It should be edited, it is out of date. The new model includes voting pools.


This makes no sense to me. If there are many competing / collaborating nodes, how is that centralised?


But LN doesn't have central servers.


It's still unknown exactly how they found his server, but it is clear that DPR inadvertently left trails all over the place. There's no evidence Tor has been compromised, though it's clear running a darknet market on a hidden server is a bad idea.

LN is a way to scale Bitcoin. It's also not a completely separate thing, since all LN funds are locked in multisig outputs on the blockchain and all balances are represented by transactions that can be posted to the blockchain at any time. LN is a P2P protocol layered on top of Bitcoin itself.

The hope and expectation is that won't happen. The goal for LN is millions of people running full Bitcoin nodes and LN nodes from their homes. If that doesn't work, we'll know soon enough and act accordingly.
Also, networking technology will continue to improve, I'm expecting several orders of magnitude of improvement over what we have today. The technology already exists, we just don't know how long it will take for it to be actually deployed as that requires large investments in glass fiber networks. So we'll certainly have the ability to increase the limit if we have to.
@_date: 2015-08-15 17:47:24
~~Bandwidth caps~~ Data limits are also an important concern. But since we're talking about distributing a very large number of copies of the exact same data, the bulk of the traffic can be local. This is safe as long as you can get block hashes and transaction hashes from anywhere, and then load most of the actual data from a "nearby" node which uses the same ISP.

One scenario I'm worried about is governments insisting full nodes / miners cannot be run without a license and without complying with government blacklists. If we restrict Bitcoin to what can run over Tor (which is a limit that will scale with general bandwidth improvements that you are already assuming) we can stop such attacks, and convince governments they can't win so they'll give up.
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:12:36
One big difference between Ripple IOUs and LN channels is that LN channels do not involve counterpart risk. Another big difference is that LN only uses the ledger as a conflict resolution system so that most txs can be taken off-chain, while Ripple suffers from the same scaling problems as vanilla Bitcoin. Yet another is that LN hubs need not know who they connect to.

The distribution system selling these microminers might indeed turn out to be a weak point. I worry about the centralising effect of ASICs. Maybe there is some new algorithm we can invent that doesn't give ASICs so much of an advantage that microminers (possibly including new Intel processors with built-in SHA-256 support) won't have a sufficiently large share of the total hashing power, but I haven't seen it yet. If it ran on FPGAs or GPUs that would be good enough, it doesn't have to be all-CPU.
As for PoS, the consensus among the experts seems to be that it cannot work. If it can, it would definitely be preferable to expending a lot of power.
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:11:33
If it isn't easy to run a full node at home then ordinary users can no longer be fully validating users, which is quite a severe limitation. But more importantly, I want home users to be able to run a full node, because it improves the ability of Bitcoin to resist government repression. If that sounds unnecessary, consider that Bitcoin only survived this long because it was decentralised. Otherwise it would have suffered the fate of Napster, Liberty Reserve or other centralised services long ago.

Wouldn't quick propagation of block headers be enough?
@_date: 2015-07-04 06:14:34
Heheh, you may have jinxed it!
Would it help if miners had the option of signing blocks? That way you could use the normal procedure for unknown and actively distrusted miners, while switching off hashing / generating an empty block until the new block has been fully validated if the block header is signed by a trusted miner. Obviously if a block signed by a trusted miner turned out to be invalid, you'd move that miner to the actively distrusted column.
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:47:38
I think the point is that there are two conflicting requirements here. With the present state of networking technology, you can't have a full node that both supports meaningful tx numbers and runs on an ordinary smartphone. It's different for a desktop PC, where you can do both at present. Twenty years ago with 56k6 modems you couldn't have done even that. Ten years in the future you could have 1Gb connectivity on your smartphone so running a full node with 1 GB blocks could be fine.
It's simply not true that the block size is not the cause of the low number of full nodes. What is true however is that that cannot easily be solved by reducing the block size since there is another important requirement.
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:56:29
No, that's not the only solution I've advocated. The other part is by no longer requiring every tx to be broadcast and stored.
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:29:19
The scenario I'm hoping for is that governments will discover they can't outlaw or control Bitcoin because it runs over Tor. They will then give up and/or limit themselves to snooping and lots of people will run Bitcoin nodes openly. Smart people will use Tor, others will use the open internet and will thus be more vulnerable to government snooping.
The scenario I fear is that blocks will become so large that it will no longer be possible to run a full node from your home, let alone over Tor, so that governments can threaten Bitcoin companies with outlawing and destroying Bitcoin so they will go along with censorship and monitoring. That would either turn Bitcoin into a new banking system (similar to what Ripple Labs is currently aiming at) or more likely will result in it not being cost-competitive with centralised systems and dying.

Not really, being able to run behind Tor is a precondition, but not a very restrictive one, at least not in the long run. I think it's important people can run nodes in their homes, even in the face of government repression. In that case, something like Tor will be necessary, but it will (probably) not reduce the maximum allowable bandwidth by orders of magnitude.


Not reasonable ones, top of the line ones, with 20 years of speculative extrapolation. I do expect massive increases in bandwidth available in people's homes, I just don't know how long it will take and I don't want to count our chickens before they hatch.

Citation needed.


Bitcoin nodes don't need a hub computer to find each other, except perhaps the first time you join the network. But even in that case you could have got the IP address of a single node from a friend to bootstrap with.


You're being very naive. If it becomes centralised it has no purpose and we'd better go do something else. And simply increasing the block size won't allow us to scale in a meaningful way within a reasonable time frame. Simplistic non-solutions don't get us anywhere.
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:23:59


I care about both. You'll be able to do $1 transactions just fine using LN or OT. And note that large blocks preclude people in Africa from running full nodes...


Bitcoin wasn't invented for cheap payments for cups of coffee, although that is something it will continue to support.


OT should come out in Q3. LN will take a year or so.


It's not centralised at all, and yes it is complementary to Bitcoin, it is one of the things that will help it scale (and increase privacy too).


If you think that then you are deeply misinformed. LN will definitely not have a central server.


Use of Tor will in no way be an obstacle to using LN. In fact, it may turn out to be the preferred way to connect to LN.

emphasis added.
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:00:03
Yes, and in case you missed it requiring trust would be a bad idea.
A block size limit doesn't make txs artificially expensive, it's lack of a limit that makes them artificially cheap. Every tx causes costs across the broadcast network for which the sender and recipient do not pay. This free riding would either centralise or destroy Bitcoin without some limit.
Now, as networking technology continues to improve we can raise this limit, but there will always have to be some limit.
If someone invented a trustless consensus mechanism that doesn't require a broadcast network then that could change, but so far that hasn't happened.

It's not artificial if there needs to be a limit. Arbitrary, yes, uncertain, yes, but not artificial.
And I agree 1MB is far too low for the long or even medium term without some technical breakthrough. At the same time I fear something substantially bigger is too high from the point of view of avoiding centralisation. There may not be any safe space between the two curves without a technical breakthrough.
It may turn out that vanilla Bitcoin without additional technical breakthroughs can't serve the world economy without blocks larger than 100MB and cannot be decentralised with blocks larger than 32MB. If so, we're screwed without technical breakthroughs.

True, but there seemed to be some move towards consensus in the past few weeks. This is true both for the core developers and the population.


I don't think the following would be controversial provided the core developers reached an agreement on it:
Buy time using BIP 102 combined with a commitment to two yearly reviews that can double the limit again if necessary unless there is clear evidence things are getting worse. No commitment asked on the part of the larger blocks side to give up on further increases or on the cautious side to agree to further increases after that.

I think that the real requirement is that the total download and total upload capacities should not be 100% of the maximal total daily blockchain increase, but should also include messaging overhead and a safety factor. I don't see a reason for asymmetrical requirements, although it is a fact that most domestic internet connections are asymmetrical.

It could plausibly be funded by relatively low volumes of high-value settlement transactions. The resulting system could be a decentralised variant of TARGET2.

If you add it up across the whole network, shouldn't the numbers be the same? When one person is uploading, another is downloading. I can imagine block headers, block hashes and txids being sent multiple times per node, but not whole txs and blocks.
EDIT: even then, you're not uploading into a void, so the numbers should still add up to the same value across the whole network, shouldn't they?
@_date: 2015-07-26 21:40:18
The paper says they implemented a working prototype.

Not seeing much enthusiasm either, but I think doing a quick doubling this year is a very good idea. Together with the upcoming block reward halving and the stress testing we've been seeing this will give us some useful and much needed data in the next 12 months.
A quick doubling does not preclude more radical changes later, maybe even soon, while it does give us better information to base future decisions on.

I don't really doubt most people will have access to Gbit networks eventually, although I don't know how long it will take.

But mostly I'm concerned about growing too fast, not about the eventual limit.
@_date: 2015-07-04 17:06:37
Instead of mining in the blind, couldn't you just stop hashing while you wait for the verification to complete? Most of your costs would be electricity, which suggests turning off hashing for a little while could turn losing a few % of your turnover with constant costs into merely losing a few % of your profits.

The original 20MB plan was presented as an urgent one-off measure to buy us time, 'kicking the can down the road'. The 20MB has been reduced to 8MB, but now there are automatic increases all the way to 8GB. This isn't kicking the can down the road anymore, this is trying to force the issue in one go.

I don't think people are assuming it would lead to that, they are merely worried it might. This is one of the reasons I think BIP 102 (with some added changes like a vote) would be a good idea. It could shed some light on this.
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:07:20


I don't think the test showed that at all. Fees were not driven up to unacceptable levels.


The effect would not be that the system ground to a halt, but that fees would increase. First that would drive out frivolous transactions, then cups of coffee and eventually only high-value transactions could go through. You may think that's undesirable, but it's not the same as the system grinding to a halt.


Sure, but the stress test did not show that was going to happen any time soon.
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:45:58
The intended meaning would be clear from context, but would a native speaker notice it as odd, perhaps even funny?
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:06:43
If it were as simple as that, then nearly everybody would be in favour of it.
But Bitcoin is a decentralised broadcast network and there is no known way in which it could scale indefinitely while remaining both decentralised and a broadcast network. Maybe someone will come up with a consensus algorithm that doesn't require a broadcast network, but until that happens it will be dangerous to increase the limit too much.
Arguably it is also economically dangerous to keep it too low, which means we have to avoid both Scylla and Charybdis.
This also shows why we can't decide anything now that avoids having to repeat this discussion later. We could avoid one risk indefinitely, but only at the cost of being fully exposed to the other. We could abolish the limit altogether, and risk full centralisation and the demise of Bitcoin. Or we could decide to keep the limit at 1MB forever and risk Bitcoin simply fading away if LN and OT don't work out. I don't think either of these is smart.


I would recommend BIP 102, which buys us some extra time, and provides us with meaningful and objective information for the future.
@_date: 2015-07-30 06:55:11

And not only that, it does so without putting strain on the blockchain. You could buy all the cups of coffee you wanted, without forcing all full nodes to validate your transactions.
It also gives you better privacy, although it does introduce some new privacy issues.

Because we're not psychic and don't know enough about the effects to be sure it's safe. As you said 32MB + LN would be enough for most people's moon. Once we get there, let's have another look.

That's an ad hominem right there...
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:39:11


This is not true. What is being argued is that there is no urgency to increase the block size and that we shouldn't do large increases or twenty years of doubling before we know what the effect of LN would be. Furthermore, many of the people who are opposed to big blocks would be willing to start a modest program of growth to buy us some time.
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:10:35


Ah OK, you mean that if governments go after large hashing farms they'll end up decentralising Bitcoin? That's an interesting observation, but it will only work if blocks are small enough to run a full node without needing a data center.

OK, that much is true, but mempools can grow a lot before nodes start falling over (so again we don't need to fear trouble any time soon) and people are already working on mempool expiration. It's also trivial to restart a node every couple of days.

Yes, you would have multiple hard forks. I think you'll find it much easier to get a consensus that way. The reason people are resisting a change in one big bang is because  you're trying to push it down their throats. So if you're only supporting doing it in one go to avoid contention, then it is counterproductive.
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:27:30


Fine, but earlier you were claiming the test showed there was a real problem. Do you now agree the test showed no such thing, and are merely saying it leaves open the possibility there might be unspecified additional problems?

Would be nice to see this outfitted with a mining chip a la 21inc, with no more than 5W worth of mining power. With power usage that low people might not mind if it ran at a slight loss, which would be good for decentralisation. And if you don't care about decentralisation, why would you want to run a Bitnodes node at all?
@_date: 2015-07-19 09:49:04
Does that completely solve the problem?
I think B still doesn't know the contents of Anchor A when it signs Escape A. It just ~~knows the txid of Anchor A~~ (edit: actually not even that, just a hash of the raw, unsigned Escape A), but not its script hash let alone its actual redeem script. If B uses a newly generated throw-away key he can still safely sign Escape A. But in order to know that A is compelled to release the secret, it looks as if B needs to know the full contents of both Anchor A and its redeem script. But if B knows that, he knows the secret, which is unacceptable to A. I think Anchor A needs to specify a specified hash in its redeem script, so that A is forced to reveal a preimage.
This stuff is tricky, so I'm not sure if I'm making sense here...
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:06:57


How exactly is that a problem? Those who paid (still tiny) fees were fine. UI changes have made this more convenient than before the stress test.


Yes, at some point something will have to change, no one is disputing that. Similarly, at some point block size limit increases will lead to centralisation. I'm only disputing that the stress test showed that time is running out. BTW, I'm in favour of a quick doubling to 2MB this year as proposed by in BIP 102, which should buy us some more time just in case.
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:11:51
The limit isn't artificial at all, though there is certainly some arbitrariness about it, as well as uncertainty as to what are safe upper and lower bounds.
Every transaction needs to be broadcast across the network, incurring costs for all full nodes and relays, costs that are not paid for by either the sender of the recipient. It's this free riding that necessitates some sort of limit.
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:13:56
What would you recommended as a minimum spec?
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:37:15
More low-hanging fruit: before automatically rebroadcasting an unconfirmed tx after 24 hours as the sender, first ask the user whether he wants to increase the fee. Similarly, before rebroadcasting it as the recipient, first ask the user to add an additional tx with a higher fee to allow CPFP to work its magic.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:42:46


Not necessarily, the tx is used to set a balance, and reflects the sum total of all preceding txs. The amount that matters is the balance, not the amount of the latest tx.

SegWit is not a proposed fix for mining centralisation, it is mainly a fix for malleability and a partial fix for the skewed incentives that encourage UTXO set bloat. It also increases the block size and tries hard to do it in a way that doesn't make the mining centralisation problem worse.

I'm not being naive. So far the generally accepted definition of Bitcoin hasn't changed beyond what is compatible with what Satoshi defined very precisely, in code.
It's quite possible that one day Bitcoin will be supplanted by something that has a different set of rules, even if its initial distribution is somehow derived from Bitcoin's UTXO set, thus preserving some form of continuity. It's possible people would end up calling it Bitcoin. Nevertheless it would still be both incorrect and morally objectionable.
Also, far from making Bitcoin worthless, its immutability and impartiality is about the only thing that gives it any value at all. Nearly everything else can be done better by centralised systems.
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:26:47
It's not complete nonsense as long as the block reward exists. Much higher volume would translate to a much higher price, which would lead to much higher mining costs as investing in additional mining equipment is profitable until electricity costs approach the block subsidy in dollars.

I don't like the idea of a very long grace period. The reason Core isn't advocating say 2-4-8 now is because it is too soon to tell whether it would be safe. If the vote is held soon, then it will be decided on the basis of insufficient information.
I'd rather have an early release of a hard fork with a conditional activation at least a year in the future, subject to a one-off 95% vote one month before. This would reassure people there was going to be a vote, without doing it based on insufficient information. Or you could have an initial vote fairly soon and an additional  ratification vote a month before activation.

SegWit looks like a true compromise if you take its opponents' stated goals at face value. But they appear to be dishonest about their goals, the real goal being to neuter Bitcoin by adding a governance layer and massive on-chain scaling. The insistence on a hard fork is intended to set a precedent for subsequent hard forks. All this will come to naught if SegWit activates, so in reality SegWit is a surrender for its opponents, not a compromise.
Similarly, a hard fork is a surrender for those who want Bitcoin to remain an impartial and immutable ledger that is beyond the control of political processes.
The big difference of course is that the pro-SegWit side has honourable goals and is completely open about them, while the anti-SegWit side lies about its dishonourable motives.
@_date: 2017-04-17 11:26:38
That's probably part of it. Note that average tx fee rate might not be a good metric, as exchanges can use sendmany to batch many txs together and end up with something that takes fewer bytes. Taking a typical tx with 1 or 2 inputs and two outputs might be a better metric.

More uninformed FUD. The "by fee" part of "replace by fee" requires the fee to be bumped. Satoshi's original tx replacement featured suffered from this problem though. In other words, RBF actually solves the problem you said it introduced.

Ah OK, that's true. The potential problem would be to slowly (or quickly) push out the nodes with slower connections or less memory, ending up with a centralised system.

Why do some Chinese miners object to anything larger than 2MB then?
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:33:11
I believe blocks are only 20% full if you only count &gt;$1 transactions. To me that suggests we probably have a couple of years before we run into trouble. And if not, we can probably safely increase it to 4MB, maybe even the original 32MB.
Note that I'm in favour of BIP-102, which would double the limit to 2MB on November 11 this year. In addition to buying us some extra time, it would also show us whether we can do a successful emergency upgrade, which is useful information. It would further show us whether that would lead to a massive drop in the number of full nodes. That seems unlikely to me, but some are afraid of it, and it would be good to have objective evidence out in the open either way.

@_date: 2015-07-30 17:02:42
I think automatic increases are simplistic.
Some people fear that there is some safe curve of block size vs time that the block size limit must stay above and that if it doesn't we run the risk of economic meltdown. Similarly, others fear that there is some safe curve of block size vs time that the limit must stay below or else we run the risk of complete centralisation and the collapse of Bitcoin. It could even be the case that both of these are true.
In any event, we don't really know what these curves look like in detail. The upper bound will likely continue to grow at 15% per year, maybe more, for quite some time, but it's hard to say for how long. The lower bound may look more like an S-curve with sudden enormous growth, but LN and OT might limit the required growth by a large factor too.
So I think we'll need something more sophisticated than a general formula for which we only have to reach a consensus on the precise coefficients.
It would also require both sides to address the concerns of the other side. So far I have seen no attempts to address the concerns of those who fear centralisation. Instead I see people denying their concerns are valid.

@_date: 2016-02-26 22:15:52
No, we cannot because the miners would run into limitations even with Matt's relay network. Improving the P2P network is still nice, but since it isn't the bottleneck right now, improving it will not allow bigger blocks.
@_date: 2016-02-07 14:27:22
The attack people are worried about is using these new nodes to keep dissenting blocks from reaching SPV nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-01 12:25:30
Perhaps not. But if there is a consensus we can always do a hard fork later.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:56:29
Core will only allow tx replacement on txs that are marked with a big fat warning flag saying "WARNING: may be replaced." Blockcypher, the zeroconf service used by Streamium, already takes that into account. Coinbase was also working on integrating it a while ago.
@_date: 2016-02-26 22:29:55
And for miners it doesn't occur over the P2P network, but over Matt's centralised relay network, which is already more efficient than thin blocks. The P2P network currently isn't the bottleneck, so improving it will have no immediate effect, as I stated above.

There is a bottleneck even with the relay network, which is superior to both the current P2P network and an upgraded P2P network which uses thin blocks.

You don't have to subscribe to it, it's how the software works.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:52:04
For starters it avoids the risk of a chain split if everybody doesn't upgrade at the same time. There is also a more fundamental philosophical reason: if people can decide that the name Bitcoin now refers to a different ledger, then the immutability and impartiality of Bitcoin's consensus rules become meaningless. This does not apply to soft forks, as Satoshi's nodes would still reach consensus with the new ledger (modulo bugs and resource requirements).
@_date: 2016-02-20 11:58:10

There would be nothing permanent about it. If LN works brilliantly two years from now, we'll know there's nothing to worry about. If it still doesn't work well four years from now, we'll know it wasn't so simple.

I'm not saying people should run in blocks-only mode, just pointing out that tx relaying is what takes up most of the traffic.


But not as much as by using the relay network which requires only 2 bytes per tx when broadcasting a block.
@_date: 2017-04-14 15:51:42

I think you're right, my bad.
@_date: 2017-04-05 15:37:44
Satoshi's nodes will still reach a consensus with Bitcoin as we have it today, there is no chain split. There is still only one blockchain. If a majority of the hash power stops enforcing the soft forks that were added after Satoshi left, then nodes running Satoshi's code will still reach a consensus with them. From the point of view of upgraded nodes that would be a hard fork, which would lead to a chain split. In such a case the side that synchronises with nodes running Satoshi's code is Bitcoin.

Ethereum is different. The Ethereum Foundation owns the trademark and therefore Ethereum basically is whatever they say it is. In the case of Bitcoin it is what Satoshi defined it to be and Satoshi did so very precisely, in the form of code. Similarly SHA-256 will always be SHA-256.
@_date: 2016-02-20 09:13:21
The relay network isn't uniformly superior, its big drawback is that it is centralised. But it takes only two bytes per tx because it knows what txs each peer has received from it. It also avoids an additional roundtrip. Thin blocks are faster than the standard P2P network, but not fast enough to make miners switch. It's still a useful thing to add, but it won't allow much bigger blocks than we have today because it doesn't address the current bottleneck. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 08:51:20


And a hard fork means surrender. One side wants Bitcoin to remain an impartial, immutable ledger that is beyond the control of political processes. As soon as you hard fork, especially for political reasons, but possibly in all other cases too, you give up on this goal.
We could compromise on other things, but not on this. For example, we could compromise on non-consensus changes such as LN. We could compromise even further on on-chain scaling through extension blocks.
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:06:19
There has been talk about beacon nodes on the mailing list. Periodically the system would "elect" beacon nodes pseudo-randomly. Beacons could announce their presence to nodes they have a payment channel with, which in turn would notify their neighbours etc. Every node that was reachable from the beacons would then have routes to the beacon nodes and two such paths could be combined to create a route from one arbitrary node to another.

@_date: 2016-02-27 10:54:03
My understanding is that the relay network helps but doesn't solve the problem.
@_date: 2015-07-17 07:00:53
Yes, and that may be exactly what we need right now. It's too early to decide on a long-term solution since there are too many unknowns and trade-offs that need to be explored first. A quick doubling could help calm things down and give us more time to come up with a non-contentious long-term solution.

I2P would also be good, and it has some advantages over Tor: no centralised directory servers, automatic scaling for in-network traffic. There are disadvantages too of course, and Bitcoin currently doesn't support 256 bit addresses. I think I2P support would be a very useful feature for Bitcoin Core. I know there is a fork for I2P but it doesn't look as if it's being maintained, and I'd like to see it merged.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:27:36
There can be on-chain scaling without hard forks by using extension blocks.
@_date: 2016-02-27 11:52:53
Miners won't switch back to the P2P network until it offers better performance than the relay network, and thin blocks don't do that.

It's disappointing to see that after so much discussion people can actually believe that this proposal is a compromise and not a call for surrender. In the case of Lerner, who is neither a fool nor misinformed, I can only, reluctantly, conclude it is a proposal made in bad faith.

No. Thin blocks use normal tx relaying and optimised broadcast of blocks by exploiting the redundancy between tx relaying and block relaying. Using thin blocks doesn't reduce tx relaying by one bit, it merely makes block broadcasting cheaper.

SegWit introduces a new style of blocks that are encoded as a combination of a backwards compatible block for the benefit of older clients and additional information (signatures) in a new, second section. The combined size of these sections (in other words the size of the new-style block) can be roughly twice as large as an old-style block and can fit roughly twice the number of txs.
As long as people don't use the new style txs, all the signature data will still reside in the old-style block and there won't be an effective increase. This is a self-regulating mecdanism however: if people find their fee rates excessive, then they can switch/upgrade to a wallet that supports SegWit. If they don't, then increasing the block size apparently isn't that important yet.
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:59:29
You are missing the point: one side wants Bitcoin to remain beyond the control of political processes period, not just beyond the control of unreasonable madmen.
@_date: 2016-09-14 18:04:43
Indirectly, yes, because it is a prerequisite for LN, which enables microtransactions.
@_date: 2016-09-21 22:16:20
You are entitled to your own opinion, but not to your own facts. SegWit comes with a block size increase, just not in the same form some people have been calling for. The net result is that roughly twice as many txs will fit inside a block and that a full block will take roughly twice as many bytes on the wire.
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:54:13
Doesn't make it any less of a bug.
@_date: 2016-09-14 04:38:39

Not every area has poles. Where I live I can choose between VDSL (max 100Mbit/s) or cable internet (max 300 Mbit/s).
@_date: 2016-09-21 09:18:50
I don't think that's what's happening where I live (NL). The old phone network and the old cable tv network compete, and each has multiple providers. I believe my modem already supports bonding, but I have only two lines coming into my house, of which one is active. I expect my real total bandwidth to be less than the theoretical maximum of 100 Mbit/s when they switch on VDSL in a little over a week.

It is self-regulating: if people perceive fee rates as problematic, they will have an incentive to switch/upgrade to a wallet that supports SegWit. Last I heard the major libraries used by wallets are ready for SegWit and it doesn't take much work to integrate it into the GUI. Ping @_date: 2016-09-19 11:17:45

Denying a ~2MB increase is part of SegWit, as you did, is what's dishonest.

No need for scare quotes around the word increase, SegWit comes with a very real increase.

@_date: 2017-10-09 17:20:06
I didn't say he ruled it out completely. He did take care to use soft forks himself and added support for soft forks to the protocol. Unfortunately he did not define a mechanism for deciding on incompatible protocol changes. Arguably true consensus  (i.e. near unanimity) should do the trick, but we're not even close to that with B2X.

It's not about a cult of personality as you so rudely suggest, it's about immutability.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:25:48
Satoshi defined Bitcoin with code, not with the whitepaper. His implementation is the specification, not merely a reference implementation. And today's Bitcoin Core reaches consensus with it. Satoshi invented the thing, he got to pick the name. He didn't give it a governance structure, so his version is it. Anybody can fork the code, but nobody should try to usurp the name.
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:48:26
They can fork all they want. The objection is to trying to pretend their altcoin is Bitcoin.

I meant a network structured as a decentralised mesh of peers, not necessarily a clandestine one that is built from nodes connected by wifi links, although I believe that would be possible too.
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:34:31
Nobody should usurp the title Bitcoin, its value comes from being able to trust that the rules are immutable, subject to soft forks. If a group (whether a majority or not) wants to change the rules, they are welcome to change the rules, but they'll have to get a new name. Proof-of-burn would be a good way to do it: burning coins on the Bitcoin chain would activate them on the new chain. This way the shrinking supply of Bitcoin would remain valuable, so its block chain would continue to be mined, while the new chain would be free to choose its own rules and to compete in the market.
@_date: 2015-09-27 16:47:06
As I understand it it is meant to be attached to your computer unlike the B1, which is attached to your LAN. Maybe I could have worded my criticism better, but it is not being sold as a full node, although the FAQ does indeed mention that it can be used as such. Compare the marketing page for the B1 with the stuff on the 21.co website. One is clearly aimed at people who want to run a full node, while the other's main feature is a command line interface for microtransactions.
If you were to describe the intended function of the 21 device in one sentence, it wouldn't be "a full node with a built-in mining chip that also contributes a small amount of hashing power to the network".
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:52:46


This is not correct. The latest version of Bitcoin Core still reaches consensus with Satoshi's code, B2X would not. That is the objective mechanism that Satoshi defined for determining what the state of the Bitcoin ledger is.
That doesn't mean that the initial rules were perfect, and that we couldn't do better if we started from scratch, but that is what the name Bitcoin means.


Other than Satoshi, who defined it as he did. If you don't like his rules and you cannot find a soft fork that a hash rate majority will enforce, then start your own coin under a new name.
@_date: 2015-09-27 09:16:30


Is that speculation or is there actual evidence of this?
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:13:50


The one that reaches consensus with older nodes. Bitcoin's rules are supposed to be algorithmic and fixed (subject to soft forks), not determined by some form of democracy or shareholder democracy.
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:00:25
The ability to move other people's coins. Seriously, that was possible in the first versions.

Not really, because miners can game both transaction volume and fees.


But it doesn't solve the problem of potentially growing faster than bandwidth growth, which would increase centralisation.
This is no better than not having no limit at all, and more complicated.
@_date: 2015-09-13 20:29:00


But accusing Blockstream employees of having a conflict of interests is totally OK, right?
@_date: 2015-09-20 16:52:39


Full nodes can be tracked if blocks are so large that you need a datacenter to run them, but not with smaller blocks. And LN nodes only need to handle a small fraction of all transactions in the Lightning network.


Not certain that will be the case as long as there is fee pressure.
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:18:39
Not just some developers, most developers, developers representing 90% of all commits in the last year or two.

@_date: 2017-10-09 16:22:12


Even in an ordinary open source project you don't get away with forking *and usurping* the name of the project. If you want to fork and use a different name, that's fine.
But Bitcoin isn't just an ordinary open source project, it's a project for running an impartial and immutable consensus ledger. If a bunch of CEOs can get away with changing the rules and stealing the name, then the whole purpose of the project is undermined.
@_date: 2015-09-20 16:42:42
But not more decentralised than what Blockstream is aiming for with LN nodes. Nodes are what matters, not the number of implementations of LN, though there are currently at least three groups working on an implementation.
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:50:36
We don't really know that. The block reward will halve, which will relieve selling pressure, and thus likely cause an increase in the price. We don't know which effect will be stronger.
Also, the block reward is currently greatly distorting both the global hash rate and transaction fees. There is no clear reason to believe that the current hash rate is somehow the right rate for Bitcoin's current market cap, especially as it is still changing due to technological changes rather than simply following the price. I suspect the hash rate is much higher than is rational.

Not with fee pressure.


There is no need for substantial BTC up front as LN can be run as a six-degrees-of-separation mesh network. And even if a lot of up-front BTC were needed, it doesn't follow Blockstream would be the only party doing it, as they have no privileged position.
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:58:50
By that time we'll have important information we don't have now: how well LN and OT work out, at what rate adoption grows, how the hash rate and tx fees will react to the next halving.
@_date: 2015-09-20 14:00:51
Blockstream wouldn't be making that call, individual nodes would. And they wouldn't even know what your or Snowden's address was.
@_date: 2015-09-09 07:01:55
It's basically the same thing only with a distributed consensus model added, which may or may not be sound. They didn't just buy the name, they adopted and extended the model. And Ryan Fugger still endorses it.
@_date: 2015-09-20 15:18:31
There's no such thing as a Blockstream transaction. LN is not a centralised service.
@_date: 2015-09-18 15:54:07
Would be nice if they also showed the required fee for inclusion in the next block in USD.
@_date: 2015-09-13 13:17:48
Off-line doesn't have much to do with it. In theory it's possible for people to generate the same address as someone else, but it's more than astronomically unlikely. The only somewhat reasonable scenarios under which this could happen that I know of are that 1) there's something wrong with your random number generator or 2) there is some unexpected flaw in the hashing function or elliptic curve cryptography used by Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-09-02 20:39:52
Good. Now let's just get rid of the controversial voting mechanism and increase the limit by 4MB every year until we hit 32MB. Linearly update the limit every time the difficulty is adjusted instead of having simple step functions every year. This is being suggested for BIP 101 and a recent proposal by Adam Back as well. With these mechanisms in place we get safe controlled growth, no sudden jumps, and a sizeable increase in the limit.
That should be enough for the near future. After we hit 32MB we have another look at what needs to happen. I think continuing +4MB/yr for the indefinite future then would be fine, maybe even doubling every four years (rather than two as in BIP 101) for twenty years.
@_date: 2015-09-13 11:27:18
You can already do that. Adding support for ephemeral hidden services would also be good, and some work is being done on that I think.
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:07:15
Maybe, or maybe we'll find out that doing an uncontroversial change is actually very easy. That's what I really like about a simple stop-gap solution like BIP 102. It has the potential of showing we can make small changes quickly if we want to. Unfortunately, right now nobody seems to want to do BIP 102.
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:50:10

But a RPi is a general purpose computer too. It might be somewhat more secure than a PC or laptop because people aren't using it to surf the web and don't install their own stuff on it, but it still has a huge attack surface compared to a hardware wallet.

Not sure about the details, but since all funds are held in a 2-of-2 multisig you could identify it with a P2SH address. That might not be the best way though, as it could encourage people to send funds directly to that address, which wouldn't have the intended effect.

I couldn't find anything in the FAQ about being able to choose your own mining pool.
@_date: 2015-09-27 16:39:25
Of course I did read their FAQ, and of course I knew it was a full node. It's being marketed as some sort of micropayments device however.
@_date: 2015-09-20 16:35:35
The same would be true of miners and thus Bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:55:18
I don't think it makes a difference for the main use case they are talking about (providing a steady stream of small amounts of bitcoin), but it makes a big difference for the main use case I'm interested in, which is running a full node and contributing to mining decentralisation.
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:27:36
Those are the words he himself used.
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:53:54
Yeah. There are two obvious ways to scale: a small number of large full nodes (big blocks) or a large number of small full nodes (small blocks). With big blocks you could use a large number of small SPV nodes for ordinary users, while with small blocks you'd need something like LN to keep the blocks small. Some sort of hybrid will likely be necessary.
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:02:14
Ah, so Lighthouse does not run a full node?
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:35:40
I don't know how long it would take to set up a mesh network. There are very low barriers to entry, and since it's all trustless it should be a lot easier than with Ripple. Maybe it will grow like Bittorrent. Only time will tell.

@_date: 2015-09-20 13:58:27
Hmm, I was wondering how this would prevent sniping, and thought I just didn't get it yet. Would it help if a miner shared part of his block reward with the next miner, not just tx fees?
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:00:58
There's a research paper out there that argues that a fixed block size and a minimum fee are equivalent, one will lead to the other and vice versa.
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:19:07
I meant what mining protocol it uses. Not all protocols allow you to choose your own transactions.
@_date: 2015-09-21 07:00:57

@_date: 2015-09-27 18:14:30
Well, I couldn't find any details about the protocol used by 21's own pool either.
@_date: 2015-09-03 20:41:09
I think this what it was about all along. The fabricated crisis, the new Bitcoin Association and now this. It's about giving the VC-funded part of the ecosystem some measure of control over the protocol and diminishing the influence of cypherpunk idealists.
Note that I'm not against some amount of VC *influence*, which is not the same thing as control.

I'll cogitate on that some more...


My hope was that this would solve the block delay problem, and allow larger blocks for the same level of networking technology, thus reducing the tension between growth and security.
Initial block download time, CPU and bandwidth of nodes running in people's homes would still be important factors that wouldn't be solved by this.

Perhaps, but then that's what he should be saying instead.
@_date: 2015-09-13 08:14:03
Interesting suggestions indeed! Maybe it would be nice to combine this with variable fees. You could specify that you are willing to pay x amount of fees if confirmed before Tx, y if confirmed before Ty etc.
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:32:13
Right now at least three parties are working on an implementation, and I believe they are all open source, with open repositories where you can follow progress.
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:44:04
Wouldn't the consequence of that be that B builds on top of A's key block and adds all txs except free txs that don't pay to him directly to his content block? In that case A still gets the block reward, but misses out on the tx fees. Wouldn't that tempt him to add a payment to B from his block reward to induce him to build on A's content block rather than A's key block?
@_date: 2015-09-26 08:20:34
I wonder what the switching cost for a large company like BitFury would be though. Significant, but not nearly as much as their investment to date.

Can I do that in Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:12:23


Not true. There could certainly be large nodes with a lot of capital, but a six-degrees-of-separation mesh could work as well. And since channels are trustless, it would be much easier to set up a LN mesh than a Ripple mesh.


Not true, because LN still relies on the underlying Bitcoin network and still needs to contribute fees for opening and closing channels as well, both voluntary closures and cases of non-cooperation.
@_date: 2015-09-14 19:26:46

That's true, but they can help defuse a very tense situation that isn't good for the system either.

@_date: 2015-09-27 21:02:05
It's totally OK if the BC is designed/optimised for a different use case, but I just don't see enough added value to justify a $399 price tag vs $132 for the B1. Maybe it is justified, but I'm just not getting it. And I certainly hope that micromining succeeds, as that could greatly help restore decentralisation.
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:08:51
Except that LN provides an incentive to run a node, while there is no such incentive for running a Ripple validator.

@_date: 2015-09-27 10:16:12
This Bitcoin Computer would make more sense if it were like the [Bitnodes Hardware B1]( with a built-in mining chip. It would be a full node that also contributed a small amount of hashing power to the network, probably at a small monetary loss. This would likely be acceptable to enthusiasts because running a full node costs a bit of electricity anyway and some people like the idea of contributing to the network. Not a huge market, but at least it would make sense for that market.
If you add micropayment solutions to that, great, but that doesn't require hardware, just software. Adding Streamium support, adding Tor and I2P proxy functionality and maybe meshnet stuff would make it even better and all that mostly requires software, the meshnet might require a bit more hardware.
Such a device would make sense to me, and I would like to own one, probably even at $399, which is a bit more than the Bitnodes B1 at $132. I'd like it even better if the mining chip worked like a USB Block Eruptor and I could plug it into the B1 or any other piece of hardware I liked.
The current device on the other hand looks utterly retarded to me. Perhaps it's not retarded at all, but very subtle and ahead of its time, but in that case it needs much better marketing because I'm just not getting it.

The block reward greatly distorts the hash rate, it could be much higher today than is rational. It will be interesting to see how the hash rate and tx fees react to the halving next year.

Not all transactions have to be stored on the blockchain if you use off-chain systems on top of Bitcoin. Those systems could be trusted (like hosted wallets), trustless (like LN) or something in between (like OT or a sidechain with a federated peg).

Based on what? Blockstream is aiming for millions of nodes.
@_date: 2015-04-12 11:31:18
Most people who have heard of blockchains at all will likely first have heard about them in the context of Bitcoin. The concept of blockchains long predates Bitcoin however. According to my trusty copy of Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography", it goes back at least as far as Haber and Stornetta's "How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document" in 1991.
However, while Bitcoin did not introduce blockchains, as far as I can tell it did introduce a major improvement on classical tokenless blockchains, namely a distributed consensus mechanism for blockchains.
That consensus mechanism is relatively expensive and slow though, compared to centralised blockchains, and there is a trade-off between speed and cost vs the need for trustlessness. Which way the trade goes depends on the application you want to use it for. That suggests there is still a role for centralised blockchains, and that decentralised ones are not universally better.
It is also possible (and useful) to create hybrids, for example by rooting centralised blockchains in the Bitcoin blockchain, the way virtualnotary.org does. I believe Factom does something similar, though I'm not clear about the details of its own internal currency. I'm not sure there is any reason *not* to root a private blockchain in the global Bitcoin blockchain however. There might be counterexamples, but I can't think of any right now.
So all in all, is there still a role for private, centralised blockchains? In my opinion, the answer is yes, but I'm not so sure about *purely* private blockchains.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:17:37


I disagree. If ownership of the name Bitcoin can be taken by a majority of the market cap, then Bitcoin is completely political and not much better than today's fiat money. If the old chain survives, it will most likely succeed in retaining the name (as it rightfully should anyway). If the old chain dies, then maybe the attackers will get away with it. I hope that doesn't happen. But I certainly will not support a chain based on the fact it has a higher market cap than a rival fork.

@_date: 2015-09-09 15:12:25
I think classic.ripplepay.com acts as a centralised ledger for IOUs issued by arbitrary issuers. And both the classic and current implementation only swap IOUs denominated in the same currency if the owner trusts both. And even then it only does that while respecting the maximum limit specified per trust line.
The new implementation adds additional safeguards in the form of the NoRipple flag. No version of Ripple has ever blindly treated IOUs from different issuers as equivalent.
Discussion of Ripple in Bitcoin circles is about as reliable as discussion of LN in XT circles. Lots of misconceptions about the basic principles.

@_date: 2015-09-20 19:04:45
What is the exact scenario we're worried about?
Suppose you've mined a key block and some content blocks and I'm a rival miner. If I build on your key block, then I can snipe the transactions in your content blocks and pocket the fees, assuming that the next miner doesn't do the same thing to me. Or I could build on one of your content blocks, share in the fee and make sure the next miner can't take them away, unless he orphans the key block, which is a risky thing to try. If you throw in some additional money from the block reward, the choice becomes even easier.
What am I missing?
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:54:55
What are you getting at? In the long run smaller blocks mean fewer txs and larger blocks mean more txs.

@_date: 2016-10-27 16:13:14
I suspect there will be a linear relationship, but more importantly, downloading all txs (even without relaying them) will always be less efficient than downloading just the confirmed ones. In other words less efficient than downloading just the blocks. And that does scale linearly with the block size.
Maybe OP is imagining that CB/XThin will magically keep working if he throttles his tx downloading to whatever his node is capable of handling? CB/XThin will then simply fail to reconstruct more and more blocks and will have to fetch larger batches of additional txs and have to do so more often.

The owner of the coin would likely notice, because he is using a wallet that supports SegWit. From his perspective a bunch of miners just split off in a hard fork. He or she would still own their coin on their own chain, just not on the chain that forked away. How much impact that would have would depend on what the market did.

Outputs of SegWit txs can certainly be sent to old-style addresses, just as people can send anyone-can-spend txs now, though nobody does. Even if you run a full node, there's always a small possibility that a majority will rewrite the block chain, in other words conduct a 51% attack. The introduction of SegWit changes nothing in that respect.
@_date: 2016-10-22 17:31:48
Someone with an unupgraded wallet won't be buying BTC and asking an exchange to send it to a SegWit address, because his or her wallet doesn't know how to generate them or how to deal with them.
If you're worried about coins with SegWit coins among their ancestors, then you're basically worried about a 51% attack, which is a known problem anyway.

Actually, I think you'll find that in Bitcoin we have a little something called "the blockchain" that records transactions. When transactions are buried deeply enough by confirmations, they are considered irreversible for practical purposes. Six confirmations is often recommended as safe, though you may want to wait a bit longer for large amounts of money.
RBF, whether of the opt-in variety or not, does nothing to deviate from that principle.

Stop spreading misinformation. SegWit has no data outside the blockchain, it introduces a new type of block, just like competing proposals. But unlike those proposals it divides it into a non-witness section that can be understood by older clients and a witness section that is only understood by new clients rather than a whole new block that can only be understood by new clients. The two sections are cryptographically tied together in the same way that old blocks are tied to their headers, by using a Merkle root.

And they also grow too fast. They don't grow fast enough to be able to accommodate Visa-level transaction volumes any time soon and they grow so fast we can't be sure you'll still be able to run a full node at home.

Your  contradicts  SegWit relieves congestion (which isn't even a serious problem yet judging by tx fees) by an immediate bump to 2MB.
As for  having a special serialisation format for backwards compatibility is a sound decision. It does *not* add much complexity and greatly facilitates the upgrade process.

It seems like a plausible contender in the longer run, once less radical lower-hanging fruit such as Schnorr, MAST, aggregation and mempool synchronisation &amp; weak blocks have been implemented.
Other long term ideas worthy of attention are braiding and treechains.
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:52:32
The solution that Core is about to launch also increases the block size to about 2MB, but in a backwards compatible way. Off-chain txs with Lightning will use chains of multisig txs that are only published if someone tries to cheat and when opening or closing channels.

You don't have to explain it, I'm not a noob, I know how mining works thank you very much.

Sounds reasonable, or maybe +4MB every year, linearly interpolated every difficulty adjustment. Perhaps add yearly yes/no votes on whether to continue growing linearly that year. These votes could continue indefinitely, or up to what might be needed for a LN serving the whole world economy, say 128MB.
All this would still be an interim measure, more radical measures could be agreed through new hard forks as the situation warranted.

I'm still not fully understanding the problem.
Miner B needs to choose between building on top of A's key block or on top of his content block. In theory he could also try to orphan the key block, but that seems unlikely. Once B has made his choice, he needs to decide which transactions if any to include in his own content block. I don't understand why a sufficient payment from A wouldn't induce him to build on top of A's content block, irrespective of what further txs B would add to his own content block.
I agree expecting altruism is unrealistic, but I don't understand what would tempt B not to build on top of A's content block if A paid enough for it.

Not sure I agree on this making BIP 101 almost feasible. I'm still concerned it will make it hard to run an undetectable full node over Tor or I2P at home.

[Here]( you can query the set of LN nodes based on a number of criteria, including the number of channels. If you select "channels &gt;= 3 and channels &lt;= 7" you'll get a very sparse, almost disconnected graph.
I'm hoping that we'll see robust algorithms that select channels in such a way that the reliance on a handful of highly connected nodes is diminished. I believe lnd has some infrastructure for that already.

The issues are very complex and technical, so it's not surprising many people didn't see them.

Some of them might actually believe that, but it is also nonsense. There is no reason you couldn't do a hard fork later. However (and this may be the real reason), those who want to use the block size controversy as a tool to seize control of Bitcoin probably realise that there is very little prospect of that happening should SegWit activate.

I'd prefer something that grows to 32MB within a reasonable timeframe, but not in sudden jumps. There's a lot of miner support for BIP 100 and I think that's because they like the 32MB, not because of the controversial voting mechanism.

That activation threshold was for a hard fork though. SegWit is a very well-behaved soft fork that doesn't prevent anyone from doing something they want and doesn't force them to do something they don't want. Unless that something they want is to coerce others into doing something they don't want to do.

Maybe, but SegWit is totally harmless to those who don't like it. Don't want to send SegWit txs? Don't send them. Don't want to receive them? Don't create a SegWit address. Full nodes and miners that don't upgrade won't even be forked off.

I'm not eager to see that functionality disappear before LN is operational, and fortunately opt-in RBF does not harm it.

RBF doesn't make it any easier for a miner. It makes it easier for the sender, though only in combination with a warning flag that can be observed by the recipient.
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:37:59


That's not what it means. A miner with the opt-in functionality installed will allow individual transactions that have opted in (by setting nSequence to less than the maximum value on at least one input) to be replaced provided the fee is high enough. Even if everybody opted in on all transactions recipients could still tell they were marked as replaceable for miners implementing opt-in RBF.
Contrast this with full RBF, which will allow all transactions to be replaced, regardless of whether the sender sets a flag. That would be much more dangerous than opt-in RBF for companies like BitPay and Coinbase who want to facilitate zero-conf transactions.

False premises are leading you to false conclusions.


a hard fork is never relatively straightforward. Hard forks are a last resort, not to be used lightly, and especially not contentiously. And certainly not over the objections of the development community.


SegWit is not excessively complicated.


It is widely accepted that SegWit fixes a very important problem, namely malleability and that by itself justifies it. As a bonus it gives us a bump to 2MB.


No, not needed now, judging by both tx fees and block size. Also, with SegWit you'd be getting ~2MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:42:10

Acting accordingly means waiting for enough confirmations depending on the amount involved. If that means long waiting times for payments through BitPay with opt-in enabled, then people will quickly learn not to use opt-in for such payments.

Unupgraded nodes will follow the longest chain they think is valid, which means they'll disregard the SegWit rules. So if 95% of miners activate SegWit and then 51% decide to revert to the old rules, then the old nodes will follow them back to the old rules. The same is true for P2SH today.

There's nothing about soft forks that requires a 95% threshold. IIRC P2SH was activated with about 60%.
This is in no way a justification for a hard fork.
@_date: 2015-11-08 10:22:49
How about +4MB each year after we reach 8MB, subject to yearly yes/no votes? Long term linear growth is much less scary than long term exponential growth. Don't use big jumps, linearly interpolate each difficulty adjustment so we get early feedback. A yes vote means next year will add another 4MB, no means it won't but doesn't stop the yearly votes, so proponents of a further increase can try again next time. Hard cap of say 128MB.
This would still be an interim solution, but one that could be more appealing to big block proponents than 2-4-8.
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:51:31
I haven't followed Ethereum closely, so I'm not sure. If the originally stated intent was code-as-law, then the one following the original rules is the real Ethereum. AFAIK that chain is dead, because even ETC has hard-forked since, and there may have been hard forks before that too. If the originally stated intent was whatever the economic majority says or whatever the EF (which owns the trademark) says, then it's the one with the original developers and the majority of the community.
There's nothing intrinsically wrong with a coin with a governance layer, but it does more or less negate the original benefits of Bitcoin.

That's correct, they aren't anyone-can-spend. They would not be frozen however, as their owners could still spend them, while others would have to guess what the original script corresponding to the hash was, which should be infeasible.
EDIT: ah wait, no, once the script is revealed, a miner could malleate the tx and steal the money.
@_date: 2016-10-16 16:05:05
I didn't say it was a scaling solution, though it is a prerequisite for something that might very well be, namely LN. And contrary to your assertion it does give roughly 2MB. Depending on the mix of multisig txs it could go as high as 4MB, though that is unlikely.

The concern with 8MB has to do with block propagation I think. And note that I'm in favour of rapid but controlled growth to 32MB.

@_date: 2016-10-13 18:25:10
Miners can select and prioritise txs however they see fit, but they'll be bound by the non-witness size + 0.25 * witness size &lt; 1 MB rule if SegWit activates. If they want to maximise fee income they'll have to take that into account.
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:55:59

I misread the title, this is about Bitstamp, not BitPay. BitPay had already announced their intention to switch to BIP 101 unless the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin conference produced a compromise with majority support, and I thought they were now hardening their stance. Unless BitPay joins in there is no reason to deploy RBF against them.
It's very disappointing to see Bitstamp also acting unilaterally before the conference has even started. Very uncollegial of them. I'm afraid we're entering a new phase of open warfare with crass commercial interests fighting against those who still believe in Bitcoin's cypherpunk ideals.

The terminology may be a bit confusing, but the opt-in in opt-in RBF only refers to miners insisting that only transactions that have explicitly been marked as candidates for replacement by the sender may be replaced. Compliant miners will not replace a transaction that has not explicitly opted-in.
Whether a wallet sets that opt-in flag by default or not is a separate question. Maybe we should distinguish between miner opt-in and wallet opt-in. Or maybe someone will come up with better terminology.

@_date: 2016-05-21 08:36:23
I don't think I'm confused, but people use the term inconsistently. The opt-in doesn't refer to whether senders can set a warning flag, it means that conforming *miners* will not replace a tx if it doesn't have the flag set. That's what's been implemented in Core.

RBF isn't really something that's activated, other than on a per-miner basis by installing a new version. And even once it's been installed by a miner, it will only have an effect on transactions that opt in, something no wallet currently does as far as I'm aware.


Yes, mining centralisation is a big problem, and one of the top concerns of people who fear a rushed increase in the block size limit.
@_date: 2015-11-29 10:32:46


You're forgetting that they can only do that if they put a big warning flag on their transaction.


You're mistaken, it's totally harmless.
@_date: 2016-05-31 02:44:21
Who cares about mining??? The centralising pressure that comes from high block propagation delays is currently the constraining factor!
As for bandwidth, the reductions are only minor. It helps a little bit, but no more than that.

The anger is not about the misleading signaling, though that could have caused some anger in 'Classic' circles. It is about recklessly (or maybe deliberately) doing something that's a great risk to decentralisation, fungibility and censorship-resistance, as well as the ability to run your own full node. It's also about people trying to change the rules and nature of Bitcoin through mob rule.

They do. Andresen and Hearn have said they are fine with full nodes being restricted to data centers.

Very interesting, but I don't think using the blockchain as a  communication medium is a good idea. An Open Bazaar-like protocol over Tor/I2P/Bitmessage looks like a better idea. Bitcoin is still the obvious choice for the actual payments of course.

If you are unwise enough to accept zero-conf transactions, you had better check if those transactions are marked as replaceable. But even if they're not it's still very unsafe.
People who do not accept zero-conf transactions aren't affected.


Because that's probably part of the reason for it. :-) More precisely I suspect it's partly intended as a deterrent to companies like Coinbase and BitPay.

If you weren't talking about opt-in then you should have said so clearly.
I agree the idea is to remove the opt-in eventually, and that's something I agree with. But to do so safely without unnecessarily hurting companies like BitPay and Coinbase takes time, probably a couple of years.

From the point of view of the decentralisation camp there's also the risk that the 20 year schedule will prove impossible to overturn. The BIP 101 camp has nothing to lose from this, as the current consensus protocol is against them. Should they fail to impose their 20 year schedule, they are no worse off than they are today. Should they succeed, then they're suddenly in a very strong position. I can understand why this is appealing to the BIP 101 side, and I'm sure you understand why it's very unappealing to their opponents.

Andresen's speech at Bitcoin Amsterdam, the announcement that the Bitcoin Foundation would be focusing more on the wishes of paying sponsors, Allaire's 'prediction' there would be a fork if the devs didn't submit to a 'more inclusive' governance structure, Hearn's affiliation with Circle being mentioned in the same press release. Andreessen stating that he knows no one important who cares about the libertarian idealism surrounding Bitcoin. Hearn's long history of proposing decentralising features in Bitcoin and explicitly advocating collective deanonymisation. A sudden flurry of blog posts by Andresen, the unilateral introduction of XT, complete with a logo, Coinbase and BitPay pretending they are joining a growing movement in favour of XT, calling BIP 101 the leading proposal (at ~0% of miner votes, with BIP 100 hovering slightly below a 2/3 supermajority). The launch of the Blockchain Alliance and now Coinbase openly calling for a switch to BIP 101 and XT, with Hearn, Andresen and Garzik in charge.

He is partially right, no government will support or willingly allow this to happen. But the point he is missing is that it can in fact happen, though only if it's forced upon them. And for that we need very strong censorship-resistance.

Because they want to seize control of Bitcoin. They wrongly imagine Core (which really means &gt;95% of developers) has control over Bitcoin and want to fire them. They have been manufacturing a perception of crisis and know that cannot last. If the prophesied meltdown keeps not happening, the hard fork at all cost crowd will lose support. SegWit directly avoids a hard fork by addressing their pretext for doing a hard fork, namely the perceived need for an immediate bump to 2MB. If SegWit activates, their whole campaign will collapse. It has nothing to do with weaknesses in SegWit and has everything to do with its strengths. They hate SegWit because they fear it.

Pretending this is Hearn, Andresen and a group of enthusiasts who have been joined by some of the largest Bitcoin companies. On my hypothesis it's the other way round, the large companies driving the initiative, H&amp;A acting on their instructions and being paid for it while pretending to be acting independently.
If true, this movement is being driven by crass commercial interests (survival of a few overly bold VC-funded startups with an unsustainable business model) rather than a better vision of Bitcoin, let alone the original vision as some claim.

It's not really great at that either since it only addresses the ~12% spent on block relaying and not the 88% spent on tx relaying. The same is true for Compact Blocks of course.

Yes, but only because they want it to set a precedent that hard forks are fine, which they are not. They are a last resort, not to be used lightly, and certainly not contentiously.
Well, there's probably another reason, SF SegWit would remove any chance the rival proposals still have, which they don't want because they want to 'fire' Core, in other words fire 95% of all developers.

It would, but not in a way that makes it viable for mining again. The same is true for Compact Blocks, which though better than XThin still doesn't make the P2P network viable for mining again and also only gives modest improvements for non-mining nodes.
@_date: 2016-05-31 22:32:54


That's currently not the limiting factor, and even if it were, a 12% improvement while welcome would not mean much.


The goal of CB is to minimise the impact of bandwidth spikes which can have a negative effect on other applications using the same internet connection even now, with 1MB blocks. Its goal is not to allow scaling, and I explicitly stated CB too only leads to modest improvements in bandwidth usage so I don't understand why you are complaining.

@_date: 2017-05-05 20:50:21
That is true, but so far we've only had soft forks, which do not violate the principle of code as law. That doesn't mean it's perfect, but it does mean it stays within the original definition.
And don't get me wrong, I don't think code as law is the be-all and end-all of electronic money systems. There probably really is a demand from some sort of identity-based component in money systems, although it shouldn't be mandatory or the only possibility. I do think code as law is about the only new thing that makes Bitcoin interesting, and once you start messing with that you undermine the whole thing.

Before SegWit activates such inputs are really anyone-can-spend, so yes, miners can steal them. This has always been the case, so nobody uses them (though I'm sure there are old test txs that do this or something similar).
After SegWit has activated, miners and nodes will enforce the new rules, so SegWit outputs cannot be stolen. If miners were to stop enforcing the rules, that would be a hard fork. The same is true for other rules like the block size limit or the block reward or the P2SH rules.
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:29:43


No, it's not, no matter how many non-technical low-information redditors claim otherwise. Backwards compatibility is a very desirable property in systems in general, but especially in a bleeping consensus system. Some extra complexity in a serialisation format is a very sound technical decision.


A very good thing, because otherwise everybody would have to upgrade at the same time or risk accidents with their money


there's nothing to disagree with. If you don't want to send SegWit txs, then don't. If you don't want to receive them, don't create a SegWit address. If you don't want to mine them, don't, you won't even be forked off the consensus, so knock yourself out.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:12:56
Why can't we have a new deployment scheme with a new set of P2P messages that are functionally almost identical to the BIP 141 messages, but with different identifiers so they aren't recognised by BIP 141 nodes?
Such a scheme could only activate after BIP 141 had expired unsuccessfully, but maybe we could start deploying (as in installing but not activating) it much sooner. If BIP 141 did activate, the new scheme would not follow and its nodes would continue to act as pre-SegWit nodes, but at least they would remain in consensus.
I'm told this wouldn't work, but I'd like to understand why not. Doesn't supporting only one set of messages and having a flag date instead of signaling help?

People are not agreeing to it. I think it's debatable whether a hard fork has the right to use the name Bitcoin. Certainly not with a simple majority or a normal supermajority, though perhaps it would be justifiable if there was unanimous agreement. But it doesn't matter, it is a highly contentious issue, there is no way you'll ever get unanimity for this, precisely because it isn't a compromise but a surrender.

It does, but it also uses more block space.
@_date: 2016-05-24 16:18:05

The hard fork proposal will not lead to 3.4MB of traffic per block. The agreement was to limit it to 2 MB because some miners were very concerned about anything larger than that.
As for Core "coming to their senses": a hard fork that simply does 2MB after you already have a soft fork that does essentially that (and more, with Schnorr + signature aggregation) isn't properly described as coming to your senses, but as being absolutely retarded.

This is a rehash of something Core tried two years ago and found disappointing. It's a dead end. Compact blocks is a superior version, although it still isn't a big deal. The big deal will hopefully be when they start using UDP and error correcting codes, which is a follow-on to compact blocks.

Erm no. Core had implemented something very similar to this two years ago and found the results disappointing. They've also long had a concept based on error correcting codes that could really make an impact. XThin is just a useless distraction.
@_date: 2016-05-31 23:15:34
It's not just (or maybe even mainly) rebroadcasts, it's redundant inv's sent to/from different peers. If you're connected to 8 peers, then you can expect to exchange 8 inv's for each tx. Since each inv contains a 32 ~~bit~~byte hash that adds up to 256 bytes, which is about the same size as the median tx and half the size of the average tx. To ask for the tx you need to send another hash, and then you get the entire tx again. Tx relaying is surprisingly expensive even without rebroadcasts.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:19:19
I didn't say it was.
Bitcoin's revolutionary idea of code as law is that code can be more reliable than governments and politicians have been historically. If the rules are enforced by algorithms, then you know that monetary policy is fixed and can be relied upon to remain fixed, that funds cannot be confiscated by govts (without access to the private keys) etc etc.
Since Bitcoin is voluntary, everyone would be free to ignore it, or to switch to another system if they liked its rules better, and that would be fine. Let various systems compete and let the market decide what is optimal. It might even turn out that various systems could coexist indefinitely.
So while people could leave Bitcoin, as long as Bitcoin exists its rules would be fixed and dependable, independent of the whims of men. The rules would be fixed *within Bitcoin itself*.
Of course, that doesn't work if people can get away with hijacking the name Bitcoin and applying it to a new and incompatible system. The nodes running Bitcoin would be unaffected, but some people, perhaps many people, would be misled and tricked into running something that wasn't Bitcoin while thinking it was.

I think the most likely explanation is that Wright is a good con artist, who knows exactly which psychological buttons to push. Andresen probably went to the meeting already convinced that Wright really was his old mentor, and he looked forward to meeting master Yoda in person.
Andresen must be in a very difficult position, he is clearly losing his battle to gain control over Bitcoin, and he is a pariah among his former colleagues. But if Satoshi returned and re-endorsed him as his Padawan, then maybe he could snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
Wright probably hacked the "new" laptop, either before the meeting, or during the meeting, as a USB stick went from Wright's laptop to the "new" laptop and back twice. But most importantly, he had probably already hacked Andresen's mind.
@_date: 2016-05-24 11:12:36


But why does he even *want* the hard fork? His stated reason makes no sense. He is threatening not to run SegWit before he has seen the hard fork proposals even if it's ready because it might not be ready. That makes no sense. Once it's there, he should run it regardless of whether there is a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-05-23 16:50:39
CSV and SegWit are two different things. CSV is not controversial. And FYI, SegWit gives roughly the same increase in tx throughput with the same bandwidth requirements.

The median is much more interesting, as there are very large txs which are just combinations of individual underlying txs. This happens with coinjoins and with txs sent by exchanges using sendmany.
Even the median is only an approximation, it probably makes the most sense to look at txs with one or two inputs and two outputs. You can see the effect of that [here](

Unwilling to compromise?

Your gripe is with the block size limit, not opt-in RBF. As long as blocks are large enough to handle BitPay's transaction volume, they'll be fine, with or without opt-in RBF. And if blocks are full, they are in trouble regardless of opt-in RBF.

What the correct fee is depends on the urgency and the value of the txs among other things. It certainly isn't always the going rate for 1-block confirmation.
When people set the correct rate, it will just crowd out / delay non-urgent and low-value txs.
@_date: 2015-11-29 13:06:02


And there's a big fat flag on that transaction to warn you of this. The solution is simply not to accept transactions with the flag set without confirmation. You're then back to whatever level of safety you had before opt-in RBF.

Core is about to add Compact Blocks, which offers greater though still modest improvements.
@_date: 2016-05-31 21:56:07
It doesn't cut the required bandwidth by up to 50%. Block relaying takes up only ~12% of all bandwidth, while 88% is taken up by tx relaying. We need to address tx relaying before we can make significant progress towards massive or even moderate on-chain scaling.
And even if we did achieve 50%, that would only be moderate scaling.
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:23:48
Or LN. There is broad agreement that not everybody needs access to everybody else's transactions, the disagreements are over how to go about it. You could have a much smaller number of full nodes exchanging all txs, or a large number of full nodes exchanging a small subset of all transactions.
In both cases the challenge is to keep the resulting system trustless. In the big blocks case I'm not aware of any feasible solution that does that. In the smaller blocks case LN would work.
@_date: 2015-11-28 14:16:55


You have it precisely backwards. If blocks become so large that full nodes can only be run in data centers *then* you recreate banking cartels. With LN on the other hand everybody can be a full node and a LN node, and this problem is avoided.

Convince me that this is true and you'll have gone most of the way towards convincing me BIP 148 is the right course of action.
I know that for technical reasons that I do not fully understand a BIP 8 style deployment of BIP 141 is difficult until after BIP 141 has expired. On the other hand and are suggesting BIP 149 could be accelerated. I also wonder why we couldn't do a simplified redeploy on a fixed date after BIP 141 expiration conditional on the non-activation of BIP 141.
In addition there are the segsignal method and preferential extension that miners could use. Of course we should continue applying pressure, but it looks as if we could get a much larger and determined group of people behind a variant of BIP 149 that activates in January next year.
@_date: 2015-11-29 11:39:19


Not in a meaningful way. If services like BlockCypher give low scores to txs with the flag set - as seems likely - , then people will quickly learn not to opt in for zero-conf payments.


It requires a trivial change by a handful of implementations.

You wouldn't normally establish a payment channel directly with a company like Newegg, you and Newegg would be part of a mesh of nodes and you would reach them indirectly.

Yes it does, and I said so above. It's only minor though, so it isn't a huge step towards massive on-chain scaling. That's not a reason against using it, just a reason not to overhype it as is being done.
There are other good reasons not to use it though, the DoS vulnerability mentioned earlier and the fact that Compact Blocks offers greater (though still modest) improvements.

The agreement is between those who were present in Hong Kong. The Core devs who attended were not speaking for Core as a whole.

No, this particular soft fork doesn't force anything on anyone. If you don't want to send SegWit txs, don't. If you don't want to receive them, don't create a SegWit address. If you're a miner and if you don't want to mine SegWit txs, feel free not to, you won't even be forked off the consensus. If you really wanted to you could even refuse to build on blocks containing SegWit transactions, though if you are in a minority such a counter soft fork would effectively be a hard fork since it would cause you to fork away from the consensus.

Last night btc.com's [mempool]( contained about 12 MB worth of txs with a fee of less than 10 satoshi/byte, which is the default minimum relay fee. Clearly some nodes are using an even lower value (or an older version of Core that doesn't have the minimum relay fee) or these txs wouldn't be propagating at all, but BTCC for instance will not mine them.
And it wasn't just btc.com, tradeblock.com's mempool had a similar size, but it doesn't show how fees are distributed.
It looks as if someone is spamming the network with these txs in order to mislead people into believing there's a problem.

Ian Grigg's statements are the only reason I still have a bit of doubt. I agree with Aaron vW that Wright is either an impostor pretending to be Satoshi or Satoshi pretending to be an impostor. The former is a lot more likely of course. But for Grigg's statements I'd dismiss Wright as an obvious fraud, as had been my belief before.

Another twist in the tale is that Grigg himself is a plausible suspect for being Satoshi.

Satoshi defined Bitcoin very precisely with code. To suggest it is open to interpretation is disingenuous. It's quite possible people will get away with redefining it, just as some people get away with theft and worse. The only reason people want to change the definition is because Bitcoin has become a valuable brand, and they want to trick people into believing it's the same thing that Satoshi defined. That's why people counterfeit trademarked goods, to make a profit off some else's work.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:55:38
I submit that this is a strange way to look at an *algorithm*. Would you do the same thing for heapsort or Gaussian elimination?
By contrast, it certainly makes sense to say that a *system* can evolve and that a system can be given a name. Most software today is defined that way. Microsoft Word is the totality of all versions ever released. In fact, Satoshi could have defined Bitcoin this way, but didn't. It's certainly possible to define a named system with some sort of mechanism for changing the rules and even the name (think of systems of government around the world, companies etc). It might even be interesting. But Bitcoin wasn't defined that way.
Some people may feel the system would have been *more interesting* if it had been defined with a system of governance, but that's a different question. Those people are welcome to start their own altcoin.

In fact you have to have intermediaries, otherwise the whole system doesn't make much sense.

It's the indirect transactions that should help balance things out and reduce the load on the blockchain.

O( n^2 ) is what's necessary for a full broadcast network, and the best (and still sketchy)  security "proofs" we have rely on the assumption of full broadcast. The concern is not that Bitcoin bandwidth usage will prevent it from growing to accommodate all txs in the world, as that can be trivially solved by enough centralisation. The concern is that centralisation will lead to a loss of censorship resistance.
It's possible that further analysis will reveal that full broadcast or something close to it is not necessary for security (though I doubt it), or that alternative mechanisms can be found that don't require it (but again I doubt that), but it's not safe to assume it will.

Bitcoin is an algorithm for reaching a consensus on the state of a ledger. That definition hasn't changed. The state of the Bitcoin ledger is whatever the code as Satoshi left it reaches a consensus on. Note that in the case of soft forks this is strongly influenced by what code miners run, which in turn both influences and is influenced by what the wider economy is willing to accept.

A hard fork (especially a contentious hard fork) is a direct violation of code as law. It replaces code as law with mob rule, or not even that, it replaces it with rule by well-funded special interests and astroturf campaigns.

True, but Core 12.1 with BIP 9 has been out for a month and the longer term graph shows BIP 9 signaling with no bits set since around the 13th of April. Signaling for BIP 68/112/113 started automatically, at the beginning of the first retargeting period after the 1st of May.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:14:59
You don't have to do that with soft forks, as they will still reach a consensus with unupgraded nodes. That is the amount of flexibility inherent in Satoshi's definition of Bitcoin. He almost certainly did not realise this at first, but it is clear he became aware of it later and built in additional support for it (OP_NOPs for example).
This is a double-edged sword, because since Satoshi left it has been discovered that you can make quite radical changes using soft forks. It's quite possible that Bitcoin will fail if we don't change the rules, but it's almost certain that it will if we do.
Do note that most soft forks have been totally uncontroversial and have added optional new features. This may sound strange, since tightening the rules sounds like removing things, not adding them. But since OP_NOP roughly means 'anything goes' a tightening of the rules can turn it into basically anything you like. It's not quite that simple, but it's close.

I doubt the US govt would have any problems buying large numbers of ASICs from any of the semiconductor giants worldwide. And Intel has a large and as yet unused 14nm facility in Arizona.

Lots of people would complain if governments interfered with the sale of graphics cards, while very few would even notice if they limited private possession of mining ASICs.

I would say that if a hard fork kills the old chain it will have killed Bitcoin. Something new would emerge in its place. Maybe it would even be a spiritual successor to it, or perhaps there will be multiple wildly different systems all tracing their roots back to Bitcoin. Conceivably they could be called Bitcoin X for some values of X, but they would not be Bitcoin proper.
Perhaps it will turn out to be impossible to define a successful currency with completely fixed rules, or perhaps it will prove possible, just not with Bitcoin. In that case Bitcoin will have proved itself a failure, and whatever replaces it should get a new name.

Is there an underlying pain point that isn't addressed by Core that makes the miners want to run custom software or is it just the one-off cost of switching that is holding them back?
@_date: 2016-07-03 07:06:05
IIRC says that Core keeps signaling until actual activation, which suggests many miners aren't running the latest version of Core. It also suggests (inconclusively) those miners will not be enforcing the new rules, which is worrying.
If you're right that we need to worry about those who are still signaling, then we have an even bigger problem since then a majority will not be enforcing the rules.
For this particular soft fork nothing dramatic should happen however, since CSV txs were non-standard, so at worst some miners will not be including CSV txs, but no one will be forked off.

The locking isn't done per transaction, but depends on the maximum balance you want to be able to have. It's a bit like a checking account in reverse. On a normal checking account you don't have a maximum balance, at least not one that I've ever bumped into, but there is a maximum overdraft limit. Similarly, with LN you have a maximum balance.
With LN, if you establish a payment channel with someone, it's a bit like opening a bank account, except it isn't clear who is the bank and who is the customer since it's symmetrical. Both sides can lock up some money and the total amount that's locked up is redivided between the two parties as payments are made.
This automatically means that neither party can have a higher balance than the total amount locked up in the channel. That means that you can have the unusual situation that a payment fails not because the sender doesn't have enough money, but because the recipient has too much.
If you have 5BTC and want to be able to receive another 5BTC through a certain counterparty then you'll need to ask your counterparty to lock up another 5BTC for you. The counterparty would likely ask a fee for that, which would be similar to interest, only for money that you wish to be able to receive, rather than money you've borrowed.
As long as you stay within the limits (no overdraft and no higher balance than the preset locked-in maximum) you can make as many transactions as you like, you don't have to lock up money per transaction.

I didn't say project management was irrelevant to projects. The thing is, Bitcoin isn't a project that strives to create a product to make money. It is a political project that seeks to achieve political goals using experimental technology. It doesn't need market research, focus groups etc at this stage. And it sure as hell doesn't need project managers, self-important ones or otherwise.
At this stage Bitcoin doesn't need companies with profitable products, nor should the needs of companies who seek to develop them figure very high on the priority list. Bitcoin cannot and should not be run like a commercial enterprise.


Hasty generalisation.


HAHAHAHA, you really don't have a clue, do you? You sound like a typical PM. In &gt;20 years in software development I don't think I have even once worked for a PM who really knew how to plan a SW project, or really understood it when told. And two or three of them even were good managers. Even those who want to apply Continuous Delivery generally don't really understand what that means.


I think I know (and more importantly: understand) more about planning SW projects than you ever will. The average coder doesn't know how to plan SW projects either. Effective SW planning is very different from traditional planning methods. It involves continuous *interactions* between programmers and business people, not one side telling the other what to do. You have no idea what you're talking about.

It's inferior to the Relay Network on latency, so it won't be enough to make miners switch. That's a pity, since the Relay Network is centralised, and we want a decentralised solution. XThin is decentralised, but not good enough. Nice try, but no cigar just yet.
As for bandwidth, it makes significant reductions in the size of transmitted blocks. Unfortunately relaying txs takes up about 88% of the traffic of a real node and relaying blocks only about 12%, so until tx relaying too is optimised this will make only a marginal difference. It is not going to enable large numbers of people to run a full node or the existing set of full nodes to support much larger blocks.
XThin also introduces a vulnerability where a malicious party can create blocks that will cause enormous CPU load on the receiving end.
In addition something much like this was tried years ago and found to give disappointing results. Instead of working with the rest of the development community these guys have gone off and implemented something of inferior quality, and are now chest-thumping about their supposed "improvement".
Meanwhile Core has been working on a solution that has better latency and bandwidth usage than XThin, though still not enough to displace the Relay Network. However, it is a step towards a more advanced version using error correcting codes, which could lead to radical improvements in tx relaying. If that works out, we might be able to accept larger blocks sooner, so keep your fingers crossed.

Is this really true for light wallets? IIRC the last time there was a real push for a hard fork by businesses they refused to add replay protection, probably because they wanted to remain compatible with light wallets. If that's the case this time round too, then light wallets will need to add protective measures to ensure their users do not follow the hard fork against their will.

If you're more worried about the XRP exchange rate than about the BTC exchange rate, then you could choose to hold BTC and only use Ripple as a far superior alternative to Mt Gox. Or better yet: to make transparent conversions to any currency and pay for everything in BTC, as long as the merchant has a Ripple account, even if he only accepts fiat IOUs, perhaps even in some obscure local currency.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:26:05
4-8 MB is too much too soon. The Cornell study found an upper bound of 4MB for the maximum safe blocksize.
Note that this is not the maximum safe size itself, just an upper bound for it. In other words, the maximum safe size is known to be no greater than 4MB, but it could be less. The reason that it is only an upper bound is because they only looked at one constraint, since several others they identified were too difficult to measure. They put in explicit warnings to that effect.
The one constraint that they did measure has since loosened, through upgrades in the Bitcoin network and the underlying physical networks, but not by a factor of 2 and it remains only one of the constraints, so 4-8MB is reckless.
But more importantly, Bitcoin gets its value (both monetary and in a wider sense) because of the fact, to the degree it is a fact, that people can count on its rules being fixed and objective. Everything else can be done more efficiently and effectively with traditional ledgers. That doesn't mean that Satoshi managed to identify an ideal set of rules (he clearly didn't), but it does mean you undermine the whole value proposition once you start tinkering with the rules and let backroom deals by business consortia running astroturfing campaigns adjust the rules.
This is not ideal, but it's just the way it is. There will likely be some sort of hard fork in a couple of years, but we should make sure it will be utterly uncontroversial and at the same time make maximum use of the opportunity to include all sorts of good changes that aren't possible with a soft fork. That includes changes that make future contentious hard forks even more difficult to pull off. In the meantime there are fortunately plenty of things we can do with soft forks alone.
In short: there is no urgent need to do a hard fork now, and it is enormously important for Bitcoin's rules to be hard to change and for contentious hard forks to be extremely difficult. People should embrace the SegWit compromise and oppose any hard forks for the time being.

SegWit itself is a compromise. An unnecessary hard fork would be tantamount to surrender, because the only thing Bitcoin has that traditional currencies don't is the concept of code as law. As soon as you introduce politics into the protocol, you are destroying its value.

Hear hear. Not only is it a distributed exchange, it can also be used for fiat payments (technically fiat IOU swaps).

No, I think the hate is from the small fraction of the population who have a lot of BTC, perhaps because they mined it when it was cheap to do or because they bought it when it was still cheap. Or from people who have invested a lot in either BTC or mining rigs. They are afraid XRP will outcompete BTC.

That's a lie. There was no consensus for a hard fork. Maybe there wasn't a consensus for SegWit either. But in any event there was no consensus for the HK agreement.
Also, note that SegWit2x means a further doubling of the block size, so 4-8 MB, not 2-4MB as in the HK agreement.

I'm not convinced by the botnet trader theory, because the botnet would have to have access to the Mt Gox api, which would reveal the identity of the person behind it. Unless they used a hacked account, which is possible, but then why haven't we heard about it?
I find it more believable that someone would time their own transactions to coincide with a DDoS that doesn't do trades, but even then the trader leaves his identity. It may not be enough to prove he did it, but it would certainly be unwanted attention. In addition, we're seeing lots of small transactions that could have easily swamped the Mt Gox engine.
I think the simpler explanation is that Mt Gox needs to get its act together and ban small trades until their engine can handle it. And they may want to have a chat with the person or persons who flooded their system with small trades.

They would have to be able to tie your real world identity to the Bitcoin address you used, but since they've been snooping on internet traffic for a long time and have access to financial records of banks, that may not be much of an obstacle for them. The USG cannot block Bitcoin payments, but it can try to retaliate, and given the importance they attach to this case, anyone, US citizen or not,  should count with the possibility of reprisals.

Ripple is both a great ally and a great threat to Bitcoin. It is an ally, because it addresses the biggest problem Bitcoin faces right now, which is the centralised nature of its exchanges. At the same time it is a threat, because it has its own built-in currency which is probably technically superior to Bitcoin, though not necessarily in ways that will matter once it is combined with OT and (ironically) Ripple.
For the vast majority of people who are interested in Bitcoin, Ripple is great, and XRP is great too. The Ripple trading system will give you the ability to trade between any pair of currencies, crypto or fiat. It will also allow automatic conversions between the two, greatly facilitating the adoption of any new cryptocurrency. Since XRP is the built-in currency, it will have the best interface with the Ripple system and will therefore be the most easily traded currency. If you're only just getting into Bitcoin, both BTC and XRP are great. I'd be very careful with investing in either, but especially with XRP.
If you already have large amounts of BTC, then the above advantages still apply, but they are now combined with a huge risk, namely that XRP will displace BTC, soaring in value and making BTC worthless. As long as you hedge your bets, you have nothing to fear, and it's far from certain that both currencies couldn't live side by side, especially if OT takes off.
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:09:17
Then don't hold large amounts of XRP, and simply use it to pay for transactions and to provide the deposits needed to enter entries into the global ledger. It will be a great mechanism to exchange between BTC and fiat currencies. Use of XRP as a currency is totally voluntary if you want to use Ripple.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:05:34
It is certainly more resistant to being DDoSed or being taken down by governments. And I don't understand why you think you'd be transacting globally rather than locally on an exchange like Mt Gox or even at several exchanges simultaneously. I would expect Ripple to become the largest pool of liquidity.

I only learned about Open Transactions the other day and I think it's great, but I don't think it's fair to say OT and Ripple are apples and oranges. That's true of Ryan Fugger's Ripple, but not of today's Ripple.com. It allows advanced contracts (just like Bitcoin and especially Ripple do) and it allows parties to issue IOUs in existing or self-issued currencies just like OT. Compared to OT it adds rippling capability (automatically and behind the scenes). Conversely, OT adds much better anonymity. I think all three are complementary and could eventually be integrated, just as they can be integrated with anonymous networks like Tor and I2P and with things like Bitmessage and hashcash.
@_date: 2016-07-25 23:01:57
You were misinformed, LN doesn't use IOUs, it uses multisig in such a way that you retain control over your funds. You need to monitor the blockchain periodically to make sure your counterparty doesn't misbehave in certain scenarios, but if you do you retain full control.

The amounts needed to use Ripple functionality are really small (something like 50 XRP to open a trust line, put in an order etc), and they are only deposits which you get back once the entry is removed. The equivalent of a couple of bucks in real money is all you need.
If you are worried about using XRP as a currency, that is to pay others for their goods and services in it and to accept payment in them for your own goods and services, then don't. You can still use Ripple to buy and sell BTC and you'll need only small amounts of XRP, which you could buy with BTC.

It is going to be a bit late to start adding impossible to suppress functionality once it becomes necessary. I think Hawala and Ripple may well merge, to the benefit of both. There is an existing centuries old network that could make use of automated P2P bookkeeping, modern communications technology and military grade crypto.
The hawaladar would probably not give you IOUs unless you explicitly wanted them, but could make use of them in his own dealings. Because that's what hawaladars do already.
But aside from being difficult to suppress, as a distributed exchange Ripple is very important right now. The centralised nature of its exchanges is Bitcoin's greatest weakness, and Ripple will solve that problem, both for Bitcoin and for XRP. OT will do the same to a lesser extent, but adds great new functionality to both Ripple and Bitcoin, namely untraceability. Zerocoin would do that too (and again, competition is good), but OT is closer to being deployable in that role for Bitcoin.

It would be enough to convince the operators of the largest pools. Would be a great story if it happened, but then what? If you simply invalidate the transaction, they'll just make another one. If you block all transactions from that address, the money will still effectively be seized with no possibility of ever returning it.
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:45:32
It's not universally accepted, you have to accept it yourself, or you can choose not to. Ripple allows two kinds of payments: in XRP and in IOUs. The IOUs can be denominated in any currency, both fiat and virtual, except in XRP. There are no XRP IOUs, because they would serve no purpose. You could even create your own currency and issue IOUs for it. Whether anyone else would consider them valuable would be another matter.
The Ripple system keeps perfect track of IOUs in any currency, but depends on users to handle settlement. Gateways play an important role in this, at least for as long as people receive their wages in fiat currency.
If you want, you can directly trade BTC IOUs for USD IOUs without going through XRP or using it for anything else than small deposits and transaction fees. If you want, you can then subsequently use the gateway that issued the IOU to redeem it for real USD, or you could pay someone who accepts USD IOUs on the Ripple system and never redeem them. The latter wouldn't be so different from an ordinary electronic wire transfer.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:27:20
This isn't accurate is it? The bad news is not that payment providers can't use bitcoin, but that they can't do business with the exchanges that are still allowed to do that. And the fear is that banks cannot do that either, either as of now, or in the near future. There is some glimmer of hope that maybe it only applies to anonymous transactions, but I've seen no real indication of that.

*The biggest concern I have with your statement is the "if" they make it completely open source until then I will personally stay away and not trust them.*
Absolutely. That doesn't mean you need to assume they are evil. I'm optimistic they will release the code eventually, and that it will be a very useful complementary tool to Bitcoin. We'll see. I won't be risking a lot of money with either them or their partner gateways. My experience with Bitstamp has been disappointing.

If you look at transaction as cheques, then public key cryptography merely ensures the transactions are valid, that is, signed by the real owner. The block chain determines which cheques will clear and which will bounce and makes the record hard to tamper with.
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:34:18
If you use one of the payment solutions that generate a BTC price based on a fiat price and immediately convert the received BTC back to fiat, then even just a couple of hours of stability would be enough. We don't need a whole lot of stability to get started, and fortunately right now we have plenty.
@_date: 2013-06-11 05:34:29
No, I don't *trust* them. I advise - and have advised - people not to use Ripple to hold or transfer large amounts of money and not to use it to store money for a long time until well after the source has been released. Similarly, I advise people against putting much trust in individual gateways. At best, these have the same reliability as banks. Depending on the jurisdiction, say Slovenia in the case of Bitstamp, this may already be very unreliable. And at worst it is a lot less than that of banks.

There is no need for the total amount of Bitcoin in circulation to be equal to the total world output during the time it takes the Earth to orbit the sun any more than it is necessary for it to equal output in the time it takes Mars to orbit the sun, or any other arbitrary period of time.

Here's one answer to that: BTC has intrinsic value because the blockchain can be used as an impartial and reliable trusted timestamping service and BTC is the currency accepted for this service by the mining network. This is hardcoded into the protocol and cannot be refused without shutting down Bitcoin itself. This distributed log of immutable timestamped entries is Bitcoin's great innovation. Using that innovation to maintain a global ledger of ownership of bitcoins is just its first application. Gold can be used to make pretty things, bitcoin can be used to provably record timestamped arbitrary facts.

It's used for Bitcoin transactions obviously. It can be used to record fiat transactions too, a potentially huge market. Trusted timestamping is a commercially viable service already, there are several companies who specialise in it. But yes, only time will tell.

Another interesting measure is differential hash / watt, in other words how much more energy does it cost to run a miner in the background when you were running the computer anyway. I'm guessing it's a tiny bit more power. Why not do some mining while you're at work, just surfing or playing games?

Power isn't the limiting factor, block size is, and that is an artificial hard-coded limit right now. It wouldn't take a whole lot more power to handle more transactions, as most of the power is spent on trying to generate partial hash collisions rather than on validating the transactions.

Trust me, I know what I am talking about. This would be about trying to destroy btc, not to monopolise it. If successful btc could be an enormous threat to government power.

Since my original post I've learned that similar worries were behind ppcoin and some of the other cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:53:52
As long as changes are gradual, payment systems can accommodate them. If the exchange rate fluctuates wildly even over the course of one to two hours, then BTC is useless. That's about the time it takes to accept and immediately convert a payment in BTC. With Ripple, half an hour might be good enough.

It would be good if ASICs found their way into the hands of many people. But that still doesn't protect you against large state actors. I wish CPU mining was still effective, and adding additional hashing algorithms like scrypt could help with that. The point wouldn't be to allow CPU miners to make money, but to make sure that ordinary people held a sizeable share of the hashing power.
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:00:46
No, and it is outrageous to suggest Ripple is anything like that. It is a worthy competitor to Bitcoin.

I'd be happy to contribute to that goal.

That's not a scam though, since everyone knows it. Selling off the currency is perfectly legitimate. Whether it is in the interest of the general population to buy it is another matter.

I agree that it is unlikely to be part of a coordinated attack against Bitcoin. It's just part of the existing government activity against money laundering. This was always going to happen, you wouldn't expect the government to exempt Bitcoin from scrutiny and to turn a blind eye to money laundering as long as it was done with BTC.
It doesn't mean the government is against Bitcoin itself - yet. It is barely aware of the threat that it poses, and doesn't perceive how big of a threat it actually is - yet.
They may initially try to control the entrances to Bitcoin, by forcing exchanges to disclose account numbers. This, together with all sorts of algorithms to analyse social networks, may allow them to discover the real identities of the persons behind many, perhaps most, account numbers. This would entail the potential for far greater surveillance of the financial dealings of Bitcoin users than with the traditional banking system.
It's going to be a long, hard struggle to maintain our liberties. Society doesn't yet realise that it will have to choose between radical dictatorship or radical freedom. The power of cryptography does not allow for a compromise position. See 
Politicians and society at large will instinctively seek a compromise position, and it will take time for them to realise that there isn't one. Unfortunately, that means that they will initially be unwittingly supporting the move towards tyranny, until they finally realise what's going on.

Bitcoin can evolve too. If a competitor with better ideas emerges, Bitcoin will be forced to adapt, possibly forking in the process. Project Invictus is one example of such adaptation. I think the Bitcoin community realises Ripple brings great benefits to Bitcoin, but it also understands the threat it poses. It would be great if a BTC-centric competitor to Ripple were to emerge.

Why would we want to prevent Ripple from getting popular? As a distributed and almost impossible to suppress alternative to Mt Gox, it's great and as a competitor to BTC it's great too, because we need competition. OT is slightly less powerful than Ripple as a bridge to fiat, but still very powerful and much, much superior to Mt Gox. It also adds very interesting capabilities such as untraceability. Zerocoin would add this too, but it is further away from being deployable. We live in interesting times, and lots of partially synergetic and partially competitive systems are emerging. We need synergy, we need competition and we need redundancy.

Over half of all bitcoins have already been mined. It's more about who if anybody gets to control what transactions make it into the block chain. Governments could want to impose a rule that only transactions from addresses with known owners are accepted, or transactions that are a few hops away from such an address, or a few hops away from a government approved list of addresses, or if the transactions aren't tainted etc etc.
@_date: 2013-05-18 08:56:33

*It gets filled fine and someone transfers you their XRP for your Bitstamp IOU.*
You would get USD IOUs unless you specifically asked for XRPs. If you distrust XRPs, then you shouldn't accept them. You can never be forced to accept XRPs in payment against your will. You can be forced to make tiny payments in XRP as transaction costs and to put up small deposits to unlock certain functionality, but that's all.
If you could ever be forced to accept XRP against your will, then I would agree with your objection, but that's not the case.

What do you mean, not too late to get involved? The point is to create a currency and a payment system that is independent of banks and governments and cannot be controlled by them. If it succeeds, it will never be too late to get involved. If large numbers of people don't get involved, Bitcoin will have failed.
Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme. If you're looking for a quick buck, you're in the wrong place.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:23:08
Sounds like a conspiracy theory. I think the more probable explanation is the obvious one: the bubble popped. Prices weren't being driven by the volume of real world transactions, but by speculation.
This doesn't mean BTC won't succeed, since as a payment system it works just as well at $100/BTC as at $200/BTC. What we need now is more stability, not a higher exchange rate.

Agreed, and I think blockchain.info's send shared functionality is very useful. But it must either be a target for USG surveillance already or become one soon.

Especially during a DDoS attack. So while it's probably good enough to get you privacy against private individuals or corporations, I doubt it's good enough to send money to Snowden or Assange without risking the wrath of the USG.

I read some speculation on Twitter that this does not apply to banks, just to payment processors.

*Main problem with accepting BTC as a method of payment is its volatility, until that is a bit more stable, we can not expect Steam to accept BTC*

It is an exchange, but a distributed one, which should mean it is invulnerable to the DDoS / overload Mt Gox suffered from.

The code looks like the work of a self-taught non-professional programmer, or perhaps an academic. But the whole range of different ideas behind the system (crypto, PoW, P2P, economics, political philosophy) is what makes it brilliant. The structure of the code itself is far from brilliant. Also consider the use of VC6, which was already ancient when I last used it in 2005.
@_date: 2013-05-04 12:28:39
If that is the case, the same is true for Bitcoin and then you should welcome Ripple and Ripple gateways, because they would allow you to transact with people who do not accept either BTC or XRP. Or USD for that matter.
I think XRP will be key to getting more people to accept crypto currencies in general. Then, you will no longer be just an island, and Ripple or future competitors will make them impossible to suppress. Success or failure would be determined by market forces. If everyone end up accepting BTC, you might not need Ripple anymore.
@_date: 2013-05-05 10:48:15
How is the fairness of distribution of XRP fundamentally different than that of BTC? Right now, people are mostly holding coins, not using them for transactions. Over half of all BTC that will ever exist is held by a relatively small number of people. What will induce new entrants to buy BTC with fiat money or to sell their goods and services in BTC if current holders keep hoarding their coins?
What I think will happen if BTC is successful, is that more people will join, the BTC exchange rate will slowly rise and people will slowly start spending their coins instead of hoarding them. If they only slowly move from hoarding to spending, then adoption will also increase only slowly. I think this incentive will encourage people to cash out sooner rather than later.

True, but there is only a limited number of production facilities and all governments might have an incentive to control production. Governments could easily print billions of dollars to buy hashing power.
FPGAs would be much more difficult to regulate, but FPGAs cannot withstand an onslaught of ASIC systems bought with fiat money. If Bitcoin is to withstand such an onslaught, it will have to be through cleverness, not brute force.

*What if I don't have an existing social network?*
Then it won't work. You need to know people with Ripple accounts, and you need to be able to trust them for some small amount of money.
*What if the amount is greater than my network can provide?*
Then you have to trade repeatedly. That would annoying but doable for buying or selling BTC.
*What incentive do people have to loan me money?*
Reciprocal access to the other party's network to facilitate underground payments.
*Right now it's useless*
It's not useless for buying BTC, though you have to be able to trust your gateway, and I'm having some problems with Bitstamp right now, as are others. Or you need an informal network of trusted associates.

*Ripple would've been interesting before Bitcoin arrived.*
Ripple predates Bitcoin.
*Point 1 is perpetual, and will be the ultimate reason Ripple likely falls short.*
You keep saying that, but it isn't true. The IOU system greatly eases the transition from fiat to crypto, essentially exchanging counterparty risk and exchange rate risk. That is its function. The point is not to use the IOU system as an alternative to Bitcoin, but as part of a distributed exchange mechanism between fiat and crypto.
The IOU system also greatly facilitates competition between cryptocurrencies. From a Bitcoin perspective, the IOU system is a strength, not a weakness. The real drawback is that Ripple has its own currency, XRP, which is a rival to Bitcoin. It is too soon to tell if Ripple will on balance be good or bad for Bitcoin.

You don't have to trust them if you don't want to. I for one am not going to have large amounts of XRP or IOUs in my account until after the code has been open-sourced. I'm confident they will release the code soon, as it seems to be in their interest to do so, but we'll see.
In the meantime, I'll be very happy to use Ripple as a superior alternative to Mt Gox.

If they release the source they won't have control anymore. What's wrong with them making some money? Besides, as with BTC they will have to share that wealth with others, or their currency will not gain acceptance and will not appreciate. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 12:24:06
There will be competition, so they won't be able to get more real wealth out of it than they deserve. If they hoard everything, it won't be used for commercial transactions and their ripples will be worthless. If they give everything away, it may or may not become valuable, but the won't be holding any ripples. Somewhere in between is the optimum value and no one really knows what it is.
I think they are right, they created all the Ripples that exist, they should be free to sell it for whatever price they want, without any considerations of fairness, just like with any physical widget anyone sells.

This will give both the implementers and users a good reason to make sure it works. If the new implementation ends up creating a fork, then that will not be good for adoption of that implementation.
And in general, having more than implementation is good, it will help spread power and influence to a larger group of people, as befits a distributed currency.

Perhaps the word you are looking for is misinformation, FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, which is a subset of misinformation. In fact, exactly the sort of misinformation you are spreading about Ripple. Since I'm enthusiastic about Ripple, I can't very well be spreading FUD about it, so you're wrong there. And I'm not spreading other misinformation about Ripple either, I'm just stating the facts. Ripple has evolved over time, it still involves a P2P trust graph, but now it adds a distributed exchange functionality and its own currency, with the enthusiastic endorsement of Ryan Fugger.
If you don't like XRP, don't buy it. If you don't like IOUs, you can choose not to use them or only to use them very briefly to access the distributed exchange functionality, just as you might do with Mt Gox. Or if you do like XRP, you can use IOUs to buy or sell XRP and suffer none of the disadvantages of the debt-based nature of IOUs.
If you do like the distributed exchange and appreciate the fact that IOUs help the transition from crypto, but are worried the net effect on BTC, or on the Bitcoin mining community, will be negative, why don't you get involved with one of the alternatives? Open Transactions is one such initiative and Charles Hoskinson has just announced Project Invictus, which aims to focus the efforts by the Bitcoin community to achieve their own distributed exchange functionality.

I bought some Bitcoin using Ripple, and got a good price. But the withdrawal process from Bitstamp was very slow. Apparently, most of the time it works like a charm, but in my case it didn't and it and several others had the same problem. Support is almost non-existent, and that is exactly the sort of thing that makes me nervous in such circumstances. It took a couple of days for this to be resolved. I'm thinking of buying some Bitcoin again now that the price has crashed, but I'm really hesitant to use Bitstamp again.

Maybe we should write them e-mails telling them we'd like to donate if they accept Bitcoin. Same for the Cato Institute. Accepting Bitcoin donations shouldn't be too much of a problem, especially if we show them how to make a donate button on blockchain.info. If they see lots of payments coming in, that might incentivise them to allow BTC for payments for their swag too. Maybe we could crowdsource a war chest for this?
@_date: 2013-05-23 04:04:58
Ripple isn't bad for newbies, it's great for newbies. The only people who have something to fear are miners and people who have a lot of BTC and even for them it's a double edged sword that may help more than hurt. And to the degree Ripple is trying to supplant Bitcoin,  that is perfectly legitimate.  Competition is good.

*Let's say I have $100 cash that I want to get into some kind of crypto currency. Government shut down all the exchanges. What do I do?*
Use Ripple to trade through your social network, let Ripple net all transactions and periodically settle with your trusted associates in cash.
*As far as I can tell, Bitcoin already offers all the functionality and the military grade crypto that Hawala system needs to function online...*
Sure, for BTC payments. Ripple adds faster confirmation, as does OT, but Ripple is more P2P. The exchange functionality is where Ripple shines, and where it is hugely synergetic with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:14:11
The killer use cases are impossible to suppress distributed exchange between fiat and crypto and digital military-strength crypto based Hawala for fiat. OT does the same thing to a lesser degree, but adds complete untraceability. We may need all of these systems to withstand a coming onslaught from statist forces once they realise what's coming their way. Right now we have the initiative, and we have to make the most of it.

You don't strictly need exchanges, you can use any existing payment mechanism for settlement, including cash. This works because Ripple nets transactions that flow through your network of trusted associates. While there are Ripple gateways, informal networks of individuals can avoid the need for gateways.

I think I did mention those differences. I appreciate that you wish them well and see them as complementary, as do I. But smart contracts, currency-agnosticism, newly issued currencies as well as separating issuer from transaction agent are common to both.

Imagine what would happen if the USG paid Intel to use their spanking new and as yet unused Fab 42 to mass produce mining ASICs. That is what makes me wonder if we need to use additional hashing functions, PoW mechanisms and maybe something like proof-of-stake and proof-of-burn.

Sure, you have to choose between counterparty risk if you trade in IOUs or devaluation risk if you use XRP as an intermediary. But there isn't much of an alternative if you want to trade BTC for fiat money. If you use Mt Gox, then you are also trading between BTC IOUs and USD IOUs. Heck, even if you are making an online payment in USD, you are using USD IOUs. Outside BTC, XRP and other crypto currencies, there is always counterparty risk. You could use cash, but that leads to high transaction costs. And of course, you are then still at devaluation risk because of the fiat currency.

The code will be open-sourced, they have already announced that and nobody will trust them if they don't. Pre-mining is a silly word, since there is no mining in the Ripple system. It is no more and no less ethical to reward miners with bitcoins than to reward the founders and investors in Ripple with XRP. Both have to work for it, and the Ripple founders have to work a lot harder than early BTC miners. Still, both are perfectly ethical and not at all a scam, and only time will tell which of the two will be more successful. They could easily both succeed, and I would welcome that because competition is a good thing.
@_date: 2013-05-23 04:00:15
That's why I said *protocol*, not network. They just have to add more nodes, the code is ready for it. In fact, it is already running on multiple validators, not all owned by OpenCoin.
And I didn't say they were screwed *now*, they are screwed if they don't release it soonish. People won't trust them until they do, and if they are seized by the government they need the network to run outside of their control or their large stash of XRP will become worthless.

It doesn't look like code written by a good professional C++ programmer, but like code written by a gifted individual from an adjacent discipline. It also contains an odd mix of boost and C-style macro hackery. The use of a Forth-like scripting language is also intriguing and it may be the work of a different programmer than that of the rest. I'd guess that a simpler system with payments to addresses rather than scripts came before the first publicly known version.
