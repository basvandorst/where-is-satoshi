Damn good post, dude. Damn good !

Alt coins will be dead once sidechains are functional. Their only remaining functionality will be pump &amp; dump. Nothing more, nothing less.
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:45:49
I had the same problem. A lot of people, in fact.
We call it the white screen of death. I opened an issue on github about it and problem was not fixed once and for all. Therefore, I switched to Mycellium.
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:14:29
Be prepared for the next Gox scandal. I can already see it all over the mass media...
"Bitcoin in bankruptcy for the second time. Several millions lost due to an elaborated ponzi scheme called Criptsy. Apparently, all virtual money are impacted. Is this the end of this crypto currencies scam running since 2009 by a mysterious japanese hacker called Satoshi Nakamoto ? As the CEO Big Vern is being arrested right now, it looks like it's over for these virtual money backed by nothing (any computer can create them out of thin air) and their values are currently dropping to their original value: zero. Professor Bitcorn with us will tell a bit more about it..."
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:14:08
You look like a hardcore troll. Going so personal ...
I don't even want to read your work.

I'll install it asap. Thanks !

The fee is 1%. It doesn't change anything if you buy at once or a little bit every day...
@_date: 2015-06-21 17:37:06
I totally agree. I would like to see a debate among all core devs about BIP100.
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:07:59
Care to develop your point ?
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:21:37

Impressive. That guy has his "tilt" moment. Good !
People start to understand how it works.
Very good ;-)

@_date: 2015-06-28 17:09:04
Yes, you need to be 18 OR you need a permit from the Bitcoin Foundation and this permit has to be signed by the CEO of Bitcoin himself (yep, he's not dead !).
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:53:57
There isn't so many solution.

Also I have to keep very calm whenever someone of the jury will troll me on Bitcoin and I'm sure I'll have a "question" regarding it.
- But whyyyyy Biiitcooooone ?
- Your socket is great idea but ... could we do it without this "Bitcooone" thing ?
- I've heard about this blockchain thing and it seems to be great but Bitcoin tssss, it'll never work !
- But ... who uses Bitcoin ? Nobody except drug addicts !

@_date: 2015-06-27 23:44:51
You're not alone, relax. You're right.
But just take a look at the big picture. Why do you think a small country with 300 billion euro debt is making first page news, right now ? They are so small. Why the crisis is so long to be processed while they could default on their shitty debt and basta ?
Because the euro is going to be fucked up good. There will be a domino effect and it's gonna be bad for the euro zone.
It's not Greek buying bitcoins. It's the others.
Gold normally surge in these kind of days. And Bitcoin is a new Gold Standard.
@_date: 2015-06-19 13:05:20
Yes, with BtcJam, you are the bank. And as such, you are exposed to the risk of the loan.

You could use Coinbase and set up an automatic buy of 1$ / day. You don't even think about it anymore and you keep stacking while averaging your price. Very powerful...

Very good BIP. Thanks, Kristov !
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:20:22
Indeed, good point. We did it and it gets better but still, sometimes a little glitch happens... I just hope it won't be the case during THE demo :)

Two news for you that you need to integrate:
1) they will default on their debt = they say fuck off and renegociate everything.
2) after renegociation, their debt will be labelled in new monkey drachma money.
Classic scenario. That's what is called monkey money.

But with such system and Bitcoin, how do you get rid of a double spending attack ?
So, the attacker:
- send the transaction via Bluetooth to the dispenser 
- and at the same time, he send another transaction on the bitcoin network (he's connected to a lot of nodes via Internet).
How would the dispenser detect that there is a tentative of a double spend ?

Hi guys,
I'm Damien from Ipsodis.com, a bitcoin friendly company specialized in Italian products.
We organise a food event in Belgium the 29th November. It'll be a great occasion to meet between bitcoin enthusiasts while tasting the finest Spanish, Greek and Italian products.
I hope to convert more merchants exposing there to bitcoin. For the moment, only us (ipsodis.com) and Fissi (fissi.be) are accepting them.
Hope to see you there,
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:32:29
We don't have such facilities for the moment. Merchants accepting bitcoin are doing it via BitPay.
Why do you ask ? You want to come ? Or maybe you propose solution to ease the purchase of bitcoins on such events ?

- network over wifi (Arduino wifi shield). But it could be via PLC or Ethernet. Arduino have such modules available. But if I had to produce an industrial version of this, I would not do it with an Arduino of course.
- Firmware opensource ? I've got no problem with that. I just have to wait the end of this competition and check with my mates.
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:21:53
I still don't understand why we are not pushing the limit already.
I've only heard pussies arguments from the 1Mb-for-ever-God-Satoshi-limit camp.
"Noooo, noooo, don't dooo that. You don't know how the system will behave, it'll be the Armageddon of Bitcoooin".
Well, guess what ? Reaching the 1Mo limit will be the Armageddon of Bitcoin. As soon as shit will hit the fan, i'll push my bitcoins to an exchange for dirty fiat...
Prepare for the next price crash, bitches !
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:07:24
Well, it's autonomous. The socket just has to be connected on the internet and "voilà". As soon as you pay on the address, the electrical socket delivers power.
Have you already seen a autonomous prepaid electrical socket on the market ?
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:31:49
Excellent idea ! 777 bits Everytime I'll find a post answering my questions, I'll tip it.
Huuum... I think I will go bitrupt quickly :D
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:35:39
I totally agree. Scalability is THE major problem of Bitcoin right now and in the near future. If nothing is done this could lead to a major Bitcoin crisis (price).
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:16:31
Also, it's not a socket to be sold "as-is", it is more of a proof of concept.
Give it a try, it's fun. Send 1mBTC (or even lower) to 1G8qeBadXsm6fNVQ1gGycLxhMGsWhpQCVY and watch it move ! ;-)
It's LIVE
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:25:54

Does someone know what I can do to allow this video to be seen everywhere without restrictions ?
On your side, you can always try TOR and you'll finally go through a TOR exit node on a location where the live streaming is allowed.
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:34:03
Thank you ! We had to do it quick in the last weeks during our free time (we had no budget to do it except for the given Arduino).
We have also done a little video of 5 min' explaining the whole stuff for the jury but I don't know yet if we can make it public or not.

Or.. the cost of the back-end infrastructure for supporting it was a hell of a cost.
With this -&gt; no back-end (the bitcoin network is the back-end).
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:25:40
Indeed... :D
As non-English natives (french here), this detail didn't pop up to us immediately :)
At the beginning, we wanted to call it "Sock Bit" (which sound quite dirty in french) but one of us refused it because of that, and proposed ... BitPlug :D
Fair enough ;-)
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:59:06
Yes, indeed. That was our original idea and it's still on our plan. But given the budget (0) and the time we had (private time), it was not possible for us to go so far. I wish I could show you the video where we explain the next steps. But in a nutshell:
- micropayment channels
- machine 2 machine payment over electrical wire
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:30:11
Thanks !
At least until end of next week (~Sunday 7th June).
It's the only prototype we have. If we win the first phase, we would have to take it for presenting it in the final (second phase).
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:02:05
Well, it could go a little bit further:
- Electrical vehicles
- Electrical producer (your neighbor's PV panels) being paid by other consumers.
- etc...
@_date: 2015-05-28 09:48:06
You should suggest this idea to the agar.io devs
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:14:18

@_date: 2015-05-30 21:00:33
Thank you !
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:30:50
Not a bad idea. I should fight nowaday about the 20 Mb size increase and already sell my coins. When shit hits the fan, I hope I'll have twice much more coins as now and ch-ching !
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:59:18
Yes, I understand Bitcoin and what's going on. Don't be worry for me, I'll be fine :)
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:27:47
I think the same.
And you know what ? This hard fork should be done and let Tiny Bitcoin and Bitcoin co-exist. Darwinism will take care of the rest.
And I bet Tiny Bitcoin will not last long ;-)
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:34:39
If XT could not survive to this, then it has to die.
Pure Darwinism.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:52:50
The fact is that a bitcoin electrical socket could be sold on a large scale without the need for the producer to deploy a back-end for them in order to check the payment.
Here the Bitcoin network is the back-end. And so, a device using the Bitcoin network profits of all the advantage of it (international, worldwide availability, up 24/24, etc...)
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:21:14
There is no hijack, man.
He tried his implementation (XT) and he failed. That's all.
And even worst, he's joining a bank initiative after all these years working on Bitcoin. Pretty weird and sad.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:18:11
No, but for the sake of the demo, I had to put it there.
Otherwise, the progress bar is not going fast enough.
You want me to unplugged it ?
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:49:41


are you alright, man ?
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:04:23
That's a business case.
Direct remittance, the guy working on another continent lights up his parent's house.

Not lizard, trolls. I can see one right now ;-)
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:33:57
Here there is no choice, we have to go for 0 conf transaction.
Tiny amount, little stake at risk in case of a double spent.
Anyway, it's just a POC ;-)
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:28:06
Perfect, go on ! ;-)
I've got all my time. I buy on a regular basis. I'm just averaging down my price.
We've got at least 2 good news today:
- Mike Hearn is out 
- XT initiative is dead
- The end of cryptsy (Bitcoin eco system is cleaning itself)
- Cheap coins everywhere
on the long term view:
- Core devs roadmap (segwit, ...)
- Halving in 2016
- Gavin's scalability initiatives
what else ?
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:00:50
Je suis Bitcoin Classic.
And Core also, after the 2MB change.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:20:16
The fundamentals have not changed.
Don't panic about scalability, man. Just document yourself a bit and read the projects being developed right now:
- Core devs roadmap
- Gavin initiatives
Mike H. try this XT shit (his version contains a lot of problematic changes) and he failed.
Next !
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:40:09
Of course, Hearn is pessimistic. I've just read his blog post. This is FUD in its purest form ever.
The part I like the most:
*The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term*, **the long term trend should probably be downwards**. *I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.*
Mike Hearn, the weak hands shaker ;-)
Shake it, baby ! Shake it !
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:04:48
Indeed. But I really hope that you will not quit Bitcoin if the fork proposed by BC is adopted.
The facts proves that you are the most contributors to the project and that you bring the most innovations.
I'm sure there is a common ground where everybody will find his place and help Bitcoin growing.
Losing Core devs in the process will hurt Bitcoin really hard. It's part of my worst case scenario.
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:33:38




Sorry but I have exactly the same impression. He didn't grab the fundamental concept.
But who cares, he's gone now.
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:53:29
Eat them all !
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:21:01
I've just tried to install it (I've currently version 11.2) but it crashed.
But anyway, as soon as Bitcoin Classic does have a build, I will switch to it until the fork to 2MB is done. Then, I'll switch back to Core (after they merge the 2MB change).
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:27:02
Sure. Panic sell, bro ;-)
@_date: 2015-05-31 10:02:20
Oviously, a business case won't be to use it in your home.
It's a pay-per-use electrical socket. It's for using anywhere else but not inside your home.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:55:45
I know Mike H. story, thanks.
He left the project at the beginning, remember ?
And now, he quits again in order to work for ... banks. What a nice guy !
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:26:51
I love these kind of analogies. This one is very good.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:14:58
Indeed, these are my predictions / guess. It's written black on white.
Is it forbidden to make predictions on reddit, now ?
If you like Mike H. and know him personnaly, you should take care of him and prevent him to make silly decisions.
Selling 200 coins right now for joining a banks initiative. Guess what will happen in 2 years ?
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:18:17
It's already the case (for the media):
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:36:19
Even with a blockchain of 2Tb, I would not care at all.
And I'm talking about my home pc, here...
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:58:48
I totally agree with you. 7 tps is the shame of bitcoin. It makes it look like an amateur payment network. 
Scalability, bitches ! You know what that means ? It's time to wake up.
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:50:05
Because the main chain will adopt this 2MB change and it will be de facto part of the consensus part of Bitcoin.
If the main chain adopt the 2MB change, all implementations have to follow or be left behind on a chain nobody will use (and value will be equal to 0 on it).
The main chain drives Bitcoin. This is proof-of-work 101.
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:28:01
I think they are still excellent.
Nothing has changed so far. Hearn is just a nano episode in the Bitcoin story.
Next !
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:27:42
Well. I've just done some more tests.
I disabled my anti-virus (Avast on Windows 7) and it works now perfectly.
It seems Avast anti-virus has a problem with version 0.12.0rc1. It was ok with 0.11.2.

Unfortunately for him, things will go worst for him. My prediction / guess:
- he's highly depressed right now (too much negativity on his post)
- R3Coin initiative will be a failure
- Bitcoin will survive (in fact, Bitcoin doesn't care at all)
- Price of Bitcoin will rise in the long term
- Hearn will realise he had a good stash of coins before today and that he could still have them if ...
It's the second time he gave up on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:12:07
Every node should have a dedicated btc address where there is at least a specific amount of btc.
Each node should have a unique address and prove ownership by signing challenge (with the private key of the address) on request.
As the number of coins is finite and each node needs a unique address with a minimum amount, you prevent the spoofing of nodes.
Also, the coins on the address should be there for a minimum of time (1 day ?).
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:39:57
heu... nothing is wrong, man. Just sell your coin and everything will be fine, you'll see.

@_date: 2016-01-15 17:02:00
As the number of nodes running Core is well superior to the number of XT nodes, it'll be at least harder to ddos it.
Adoption of XT was very weak. So it was easy to get rid of it. Hearn failed with his XT initiative. Deal with it.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:37:49
I just suppose that developpers like G. Maxwell, Adam Back, Pieter Wuille and the others will not rage quit "à la Mike Hearn" a project such as Bitcon because the block size has been increased to 2MB while they were advicing different solutions.
This is how the development process will be decentralized in the coming future. You should start to be used to it.
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:34:33
Exactly ! And Bitcoin, as a superorganism, doesn't give a shit at all.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:33:27
I dismiss Hearn since his XT initiative.
He's now working for banks. This guy didn't understand Bitcoin properly.
He's out and it's a damn good news !
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:39:57
And believed in the project so much that he left after 1 year...
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:38:13
Yes, it's a possibility, indeed.
Core is an implementation and I doubt it will keep the monopoly forever.
I'm pretty sure Bitcoin Classic will be adopted and will be able to push a change towards a 2MB block size very soon.
Problem with XT was that it contained other stuffs than only the change for the block size.
I've got the impression that Gavin is approaching the good way to decentralize more the development side. And this is good.

I offered bitcoin to a friend 2 years ago and now, every time I see him, he told me about this gift and thank me so much about it.
Also, now, he's deep into Bitcoin.
BTC is THE ultimate gift.
EDIT: In fact, I did it for another friend as well. He told me: "I'm lucky to have a friend so clever like you. I don't know how I could give you such a nice gift back."
Indeed, after I gave him bitcoins, he invested himself into it and he's now very happy.
But thank you anyway for your advice, I'll stick to my way of gifting people I love.

First rule of Bitcoin is:
"Do not use Blockchain.info"
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:32:10
I've got the default value (125). And in fact, I can simply use this parameter to limit / control the bandwith consumption of my node.
So, let's say that if the blocks get bigger and bigger, I'll just have to reduce the maxconnections parameter of my node and so my node will less serve the others but I don't think it'll be problematic.
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:12:41
Why not, indeed.
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:28:10
:) indeed. Sorry, my keyboard corrector sometimes prefers the french version of words.
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:37:54
I don't know exactly but I can tell you for sure that the max connection setting is 125 (default value) and when I look the value from time to time, it's around ~50 inbound connections usually.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:02:23
Yeah, indeed. I would like to know too how we can support this BIP.
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:44:37
Andreas is a rock star. Really. I'm very impressed by this guy.
@_date: 2015-08-22 21:28:14
Wow, relax man. I'm talking here about the bandwith consumption of a node.
I simply base myself on the actual consumption of my node: 150 Gb / month (download + upload). So if the size of the block is multiplied by 8, you'll get at least the actual consumption X 8 = 1.2 Tb.
I'm not talking about storage. Storage is not the problem. Bandwith is.

For a week only? This problem is there for a long long time. Sometimes, it works but most of the time, blockchain via Tor is totally unusable. Since the problem is there for several months now, take your own conclusion. Blockchain should stop pretending they are offering this service.
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:44:06
Thanks, Gavin. I think it'll do the trick and I'm suprised I didn't think about it sooner.
It may be good to make people more aware of this setting and the possible impact on the data consumption of their node.
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:29:21
Well.... Gavin should check the bandwith consumption of a node with 1MB block. My node consumes 150GB / month with the actual block size. With 8MB block, I'm out (of running a node) as I've got a quota of 500GB / month (the so-called "unlimited" in Belgium).
So yeah, 2 MB sounds right for me right now.
Edit: MB instead of Mb.
@_date: 2015-08-23 12:22:00
I know. This scenario is totally feasible if the dollar continues dropping towards zero. And I'm sure this will happen someday and if Bitcoin is still there at that time, we've got it (+inf, bitches !)
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:05:15

@_date: 2015-08-04 17:59:13
Ignore them completely.
If Bitcoin is still there in the coming years and if it's successful (things we are convinced of, of course). They'll come.
No need to call them. But, yeah, why not give it a try from time to time just to take temperature...

Let's say that this time, there is more blood on the streets than ever before :)
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:06:23
All devs want to leave the 1Mb limit. The problem is that there is no consensus on how we leave it.
BIP101 has been proposed by Gavin, but there are others BIP and more coming in the near future.
What I can say about BIP101, and why I'm against is that doubling every 2 year is too much. It's ok for CPU and storage but for the bandwith, no way.
I'll give you a small example: my node consumes 100Gb / month (download + upload). So, by simply going to 8Mb blocks, it'll consume at least 800Gb / month. As I've got a quota of 500Gb / month (they call that "unlimited" in Belgium). I'll have to shutdown my node (or tweak it so that it'll only leech, great !).
That's why I like SIPA ( A growth of 17.7% instead of 40% (BIP101) is much more sustainable.
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:19:03
This is the end, man. Bitcoin is going full throttle to the ground. A lot of weak hands selling due to uncertainty regarding its future and potential.
We could even hit 100$ in the near future if nothing else is proposed instead of BIP101.
If BIP101 is adopted, that's the open door to potential centralization and so mining regulation. Also, running a node will consume 1Tb per month (with 8Mb block) so, a lot of people won't be able to run their node.
Now, tell me, how in such circumstances the price could go up ?
Edit: typo
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:04:16
You should read the dev mailing list and check what's going on this side. This block size problem is tricky and that's why it takes time to solve it properly. I don't buy anymore the arguments saying that some devs just want to block the situation. All of them wants the best for Bitcoin.
On the other side, i'm more worried about this 75% threshold.
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:42:55
I just talk about Bitcoin when I have an opportunity (people opened to listen, .. ). So far, so good:
-Dad and Bro bought some. Whenever I owe money to my Dad, I give it back in BTC (like 'lawnmower').
-Best friend bought some (and understand the basics).
-All my team at work (energy company) is now Bitcoin friendly and understand the basics. Some have bought non-negligible amount. We do innovation projects involving Bitcoin. There is still some work to do with Top Management, but it's coming.
I still have difficulties convincing local merchants to accept it. Otherwise, I can see Bitcoin is growing around me.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:13:03
I agree with Mike Hearn on that. It's not the miners responsibility to vote for the block size.
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:37:19
I would prefer 3.913 Mb in January 2016.
What do you think ?
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:12:06
Even if they are not sold immediately, it means the miner has bought them at a price reflected by the operational cost of the mine (hardware, energy, workers, ...).
So, money / energy keeps flowing into the Bitcoin economy and keeping the price stable hence the inflation of 10%.
It's one of the most bullish sign of Bitcoin. But apparently, not a lot of people understand it.
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:46:39
I love your comment. That's the way we should say it.
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:31:11
Do you realize that people can already do that with third party programs that can throttle bandwith (upload / download) per process ?
Bitcoin is designed to even work on top of a shitty network. Your network could be composed of pigeons and it will still work. Badly, but it'll work.

I agree. Last lines I drew all converge towards a target price of 10k with a bubble explosion leading the price around 2k. This is expected around end 2015 / beginning of 2016.
So, one advice: you should get accustomed of writing Bitcoin price with a "k".

Yes, calling him a Prophet (wow, an uppercase P) was done on purpose in order to say loudly: "This guy rocks !".
Giving a prediction or guessing is nearly the same and I don't think it makes any difference here (or at least not for me). And you should note also that the tone Andreas use (very confident) implies more a prediction than a guess. Guess or prediciton, that's very subjective.
Anyway, you seems to overreact to my statement, no ? Is that so important to you ?

hehe, unfortunately, they clearly state that they consider the time of sending:
Bittrex's cross chain recovery policy is that we will only attempt to recover deposits that exceed $5000 at the time of deposit, **within 7 days of the deposit** and will charge a 0.1 BTC for this recovery
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:21:11
I'm glad for you that you recover your fund.
In this case, Bittrex owns the private key of the address where my BTC has been sent but they don't want to move. I even proposed them to keep 0.2 BTC out of it but "the policy is the policy".
I was expecting a little bit more cooperation from their side instead of just "keeping my BTC for them" because they are protected by their policy.
Anyway, I've learn my lesson as well but I don't think I'll be the last one to fall into that trap.
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:39:06
I didn't lost less than 5k. **I lost nearly one full BTC**. This is not the same. We both know 1BTC will be worth million $ in the near future.

Indeed I do both. I want to warn people about their policy and I blame them about the policy as well.
I can hardly justify their policy, **can you** ? 
I can't justify a 5k threshold for representing the amount of work and risk involved by the fact to give back my money ?
In the end, do you want me to feel cool because I lost 1 BTC  in this story ? 
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:55:27
As stated in my post:
I just wanted to share it with people so that they don't do the same mistake. I did pay attention, as I thought I was sending BCC to that address but Bitcoin ABC sent my BTC instead (because the node was not fully synchronized).
As you said, everyone knows to never send to the wrong address. I was more suprized by Bittrex policy about coins recovery and especially because they have the private key of that address. They could send me back this BTC but they do nothing below 5k. My case is settled, I know it now.
But better telling others about such crapy policies in order to avoid such "bad suprises". No ?

You're just a redditor for 2 months, but still I reply to you. So, be grateful.
I was aware it was a BCC address and I wanted to send BCC there as well. However, I did a mistake with Bitcoin ABC that sent my real BTC to this address. No problem, there, except with Bitcoin ABC, it's my mistake.
However, one can hardly justify the Bittrex policy to keep the coins in that case. How the 5k threshold is representing the amount of work and risk involved by the fact to give back my money ??
I lost 50% of my BTC stash, what do you expect ? You want me to be cool about that ? I prefer warning people one more time than just relying on Bittrex notifying you that they will keep your money for nearly unjustified reasons.

Dunn: Hey, Dinesh. Dinesh. I'm on the phone with the bank and they say they need an extra form for your payroll, because of your visa?
Dinesh: Visa? What visa? I'm a fucking US citizen.
Dunn: [on phone] I have Dinesh Chugtai here, and he's pretty irate because... Oh, I see. Bertram Gilfoyle is the foreign national. Citizen of Canada. Okay, thank you.
Dinesh: You're Canadian?
Gilfoyle: Your "borders" are merely a construct. I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world.
Dunn: Do you mind just sending them the form so they know you're here legally?
Gilfoyle: Yes, I mind. And also I may not be. To wit, maybe you could make out my checks to cash? **Or bitcoin**.
Dinesh: I didn't know I was working with an illegal.

It's good to have this document.
Next time someone pretends it's not true, I'll redirect him to this study.
It's crazy that we need to have a scientific study in order to understand how our current system currently works.
It only shows one thing purely and clearly: the financial system is not transparent at all.
Everybody should learn this "shit" at school. Oooh wait, if that was the case, this system wouldn't exist because every body would see the failure and the unfairness in it.
Anyway, thanks for the link.

Dear redditor for 2 months,
I think it's good to notify people about these policies.
I was not aware of it before it did happen to me. Better telling people and making them aware of it so that they won't do the same mistake.

They will fallback to gold, then.
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:55:33
You're right.
The killing application for Bitcoin is that it will be the reserve currency.
But this cannot happen quickly. Current fiat have to die first. And they will ... while Bitcoin will survive.
The more Bitcoin survive the more chance it will be adopted as a reserve currency.
@_date: 2015-04-09 11:37:44
A, B and C are right (with your experience).
But if you ask someone from Argentina or Cyrpus to evaluate these points, he will have a very different point of view.
All financial indicators are in the red right now (USA and / or EU). This means a financial meltdown is likely to come in the near future. When ? 1 year ? 10 years ? Nobody knows. But when it'll come to you, you'll start having problem with your beloved fiat money.
A solution for people in order to protect against that is to buy Gold, Silver and Bitcoin. Of course, there are other solutions to protect your wealth.
Anyway, if Bitcoin is not useful for you, most people don't care. Don't buy it, don't try to understand it or spend 3 hours writing your post in this sub. Go outside and do something else.
You could travel the world a bit and see that there are hundred of different money in the world. You'll experience changing fiat money to another. Losing money because of the exchange rates, ...all that stuff. Bitcoin is one of them. But its particularity is that it's accepted more and more in a majority of countries. Travelling is one of the killing application of Bitcoin.
Don't try to see what you cannot see.
Enjoy life first and then, maybe, you'll see something ;-)
And if you still don't see anything, just wait a few years and maybe, Bitcoin will have an application for which it'll make your life easier.
Who knows ? :)
Also, don't forget that there are people out there that are still not using Internet or a mobile phone. These wonderful applications don't affect their lives. Well, there is a bunch of people that are not using Bitcoin now and that probably won't in the future.
Who cares ?

You could circumvent a lot of your problem by buying on a regular basis and fill your bitcoin (mobile) wallet so that you'll always have some bitcoin with you.
If you want to convert fiat immediately to bitcoin for buying, you can use the hedged accounts of CoinJar or Coinapult (I suppose it's the same as BitReserve).

This news is a hell of a good news for Bitcoin. The FED is shooting itself in the foot. 
- With an observable ledger like Bitcoin, you can know at any time how many coins are in circulation. If the FED starts printing money like crazy, people will be aware of it: "Wow, there are now 2 trillion BitDollar in circulation while there was only 1 trillion one month ago. Where does this money come from and where is it going ? Shit, I understand now why the price are rising (inflation awareness)".
- If people get accustomed with new digital money, they'll be more confident of using Bitcoin. "Ooh, it's not that complicated after all. It's even more convenient than other payment system. Blockchain (even if BitDollar will be implemented with a SQL database) is da shit !"
- People will quickly understand the crucial difference between the BitDollar and Bitcoin: the fixed supply. Bitcoin is the reserve currency just like gold.
So, go on ! Let's create the BitDollar. I'm all in.... Bitcoin ! ;-)

Prepare for "above Joe" to start throwing money on the Bitcoin mix.
And look at the title: "What'd you miss ?" is another traduction of "Buy now or cry later". That's the only message of the video.

@_date: 2015-11-04 15:17:42
That's exactly what I do. It will make you a strong hand:
- you won't cry if the price decrease and you'll be happy as you can buy more with your monthly 100$
- you will be happy if the price increase (because there are nice animated gifs on this sub during these times)
In conclusion, you'll always be happy and will never sell low.
Bitcoin is the first digital worldwide reserve currency. Think about this twice before selling anything.

Perfect, thanks !
Does anyone know a similar app on iOS ?
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:30:30
US is not the world. 
Bitcoin can be banned in US, that's a risk but there is little chance Bitcoin will be banned simultaneously in all countries.
On the other hand, it's sure that a ban in US will result in a significant price decrease. Just like everytime it is banned in China.
But will Bitcoin survive ? Yes. There will be blood, but it will survive.
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:11:21
And the Blockchain hype, too ;-)
More seriously, do we have any proof of the number of coins stored there ? 
And I don't think a Blockchain.info disaster would kill Bitcoin. The protocol would still be there and a lot of people would be delighted to grab some cheap coins on the exchanges in case of a price drop.
The bad actors (Mt Gox, Blockchain.info, ...) of the Bitcoin economy will always be wiped out one way or another. The sooner, the better.
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:12:44

I'll advice the following way in order to understand why Bitcoin has value:
1. Understand why gold has value and what could be the motivation to invest in it (Austrian economics, reserve currency, limited supply, etc...). If you don't get that, stop here, you won't get Bitcoin.
2. As you get 1, you need to understand that Bitcoin is digital Gold. 
Downside of 2 is that Bitcoin is not physical gold. But on the other side, it gives it so many advantages like divisibility and transportability against physical gold.
3. Then, if you get 2, compare market cap of Gold (7000 billions) against market cap of Bitcoin (29 billions).
If you get 1, 2 and 3 your next move should be to buy at least 1 BTC (or a piece of it). Welcome aboard !
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:16:17
Not officially. If you own a business, you can't already accept milk as a currency.
On a person 2 person level, I think nearly nothing is enforceable.
But it can go further than that. Remember when gold was forbidden in the US ? Only the act of possessing gold was illegal.
Why couldn't they do the same with cryptocurrencies ? I know it sounds crazy (i'm just playing devil's advocate, here) but ... aren't people making laws a bit crazy too ?
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:06:20

I also agree with your response.
All these things CAN happen and are already happening in several countries: China (from time to time), Russia (jail time if you touch cryptocurrencies), ...
That's one of the major risk. But on the other hand, I doubt that Bitcoin will replace a state currency in the coming years. I see more a peaceful co-existence. That's why I think bankers and the States should not be worried at all.
I see more Bitcoin as an international parallel currency.

Hodl and buidl are the success keys for Bitcoin.
Be a strong hand and only invest what you can on a monthly basis. Then cold store them and forget them for 20 years or more (this is "cryonics" storage).
If you want to surf the waves, ok. But don't cry if you're buying high and selling low.
If you can build something for Bitcoin to succeed, just try ! And if it fails, try again !
Teach a bit Bitcoin around you but don't preach too much. to people who don't want to listen or dismiss it. Don't lose your time with them. Teach only Bitcoin to yourself and to people who want to learn about it.

Yeaaah, I know that. People at work already laughed at me about bitcoin. But now, you are being laughed at if you don't know what it is and how it works.
People of my department knows about bitcoin, some have read the paper, some are stacking bitcoin and some try to find new applications of bitcoin within our business (energy) every day.
But in other departments, a lot of people doesn't still get it. But I don't care, I'm sure it will change with time.
Another example:
- a colleague of mine was very aggressive about bitcoin (ponzy, drug dealer, mafia, etc..). But once I explained him how it works and what it is exactly. His mind did a 180° turn. He's now a bitcoin advocate.
- The same happened with my father ...
Why was their mind totally opposed to the bitcoin idea ? Probably because of f***ing mass media brain washing.

A lot of people here (me included), are hard believers and will advice you to hold them (see the post with the 12 words wallet on how to store them properly). You don't have bills and have plenty time in front of you, take some pop-corn and watch.

I post this after reading one of your posts.
Also, I'm ready to donate and I think it will help having more nodes online.
And the physical decentralization of the nodes will be much better than now because the Synology NAS are usually located at home. 
Compare this with 100 VPS running in the same datacenter :)

But it has nothing to do with Bitcoin. They just accept Bitcoin as a payment method among many others. I don't want Bitcoin being linked with this shit.

"That would look something like this"... huuum, very precise. You are just taking numbers out of your head and making a silly guess. Could you justify a bit the numbers you've chosen ?
Also, there is 1% missing. Are you a fan of conspiracy theories ? :)
@_date: 2015-11-07 20:21:03
Yep. Already installed and tried.
Very good app, good job.
A suggestion for future improvement:
- be able to make group / folder of addresses in order to see separate total. For example, a user has different cold storage for different purposes: personal, business, child A, child B, ...
Also, how does the app query the bitcoin network for getting transactions of the addresses ? Is it via SPV to random nodes ?

Mining bitcoin or buying bitcoin is the same thing from an investment point of view. Only the price of bitcoin may be different for each option.
Take the option where it's cheapest for you.
Except if you have nearly free energy, simply buying would be the best choice (and there is less work to do than mining).
Now, in order to know if it's the right time to buy bitcoin... you're on you own, there ;-)

That's the core service Bitcoin provides.

Copy/pasta as requested:
But here's why institutional investors are likely to prefer the Gemini Bitcoin exchange…
What Sets the Gemini Bitcoin Exchange Apart
Part of the appeal of the Gemini Bitcoin exchange is the painstaking effort the Winklevoss twins have made to ensure it's fully compliant with all regulations. That goes a long way to building confidence in an institution – particularly a new one based on a digital currency that itself is only six years old.
But the Winklevoss twins also believe Gemini has features that will make it more appealing to institutional traders.
"We describe Gemini as an E-Trade, because we'll have a web interface, like Nasdaq, because we have a matching engine order book, and like DTC [Depository Trust Company] because we are also a clearing and settlement house. We are basically all three functions collapsed into one," Tyler Winklevoss told Modern Trader. "When we discuss what we're doing with the institutional crowd, they get really excited about the clearing and settlement aspects of what we're doing, and the reduction in costs. Bringing that friction down is a massive opportunity."
The Gemini Bitcoin exchange also fits into a larger trend of rapidly increasing Wall Street interest in the digital currency. Last month, for instance, nine major world banks announced they had formed a partnership to study ways to incorporate Bitcoin into the global financial markets, an alliance that since has grown to 22.
The Gemini exchange is just one Bitcoin investing initiative the Winklevoss twins have undertaken.
They also are awaiting U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will trade under the ticker Nasdaq: COIN. Approval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF is expected before the end of the year.
The Winklevoss twins also created their own Bitcoin price index, the Winkdex, which uses a weighted formula based on trading at the top three Bitcoin exchanges.
But for now, they're very much focused on launching the Gemini Bitcoin exchange.
"Our days are focused on building what we consider a pure-play Bitcoin exchange," Tyler Winklevoss told Modern Trader. "We need to make sure it's an active, healthy market with the right participants, so that when people show up, there's liquidity, a full order book and everything works as expected and advertised. We're trying to do this one thing really right, in a way that the community hasn't seen yet."

Anyway, one constraint we've got in the competition is that we must use (somehow) an Arduino.

Yes mining will still be required.
Miners have the new created bitcoins reward + the transaction fees.
If there is no new bitcoins created, then they will only have the remaining transaction fees. These fees could represent a very decent amount by then.

Coming months ? No clue ...
If you invest in Bitcoin, you should always have the following in mind:
- it's risky and experimental
- only invest money you can afford to lose
- have a long term horizon(= don't expect too much in the coming months / years).

The bitcoin wifi hotspot earns bitcoin via offering internet connection to end users and it pays the electricity in bitcoin to the plug.
I like the idea of chaining the devices.

The audience for these kind of trackers are "classic" investors.
Some people don't want or even can't deal with the complexity of setting up a wallet and securing it.
But still, if they find Bitcoin as an interesting investment, they can still join the bandwagon through these trackers.
