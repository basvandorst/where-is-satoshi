Long green sticks with no red in between? Looks like a pnd.  But this is Bitcoin so the rules don't always apply.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:34:47
Could it be our lord and savior Satoshi nakamoto came back to save us?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:17:21
Any exchange charts will do.  It's not a pnd like I thought it was.. it is a legit bull run.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:03:14
Not sure if this has anything to do with Bitcoin.  You should post that in askreddit instead of here.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:32:16
Black wednesday? Every coin for sale!
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:48:51
It is dangerously closing up to 17k again (Coinbase) while LTC / other Altcoins have been stagnant this whole weekend.
Simply put, Altcoin HODLER's need more time to really go up but now that BTC is back up again, everybody will sell their Alts back into BTC Ergo... Altcoins go back down again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:37
Better cash out now while you can.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:37:49
Only advice you need is buy it and HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:39:10
Old news bruh.  Read the date.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:27:06
You do know that the Bitcoin unconfirmed transactions are in the thousands right? It ain't Coinbase fault.  Blame the network.
This is why I convert it to ETH or LTC into Coinbase instead of using BTC, ETH took me 15 minutes max.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:34:55
We're back in business boys.  Next stop: 11.7k &gt; 12.5k.  Just HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:07:40
It's gone, sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:03:23
Never underestimate the power of Whales.  Today almost hit 20k from 12k yesterday.... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:56
This is a unnatural growth man, It can't go up forever... or can it?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:37:57
According to Bitcoin status here, "Degraded Performance"
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:27:57
It's just consolidating right now.  Better jump in before the big push up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:04:05
Oh, I dunno about Canada.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:03:46
Just eat the fees man, screw it. $10 - $20 is a small price to pay when your about to earn hundreds.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:51
Coinbase currently has Bitcoin under "Degraded performance" aka Transactions are slow, backlog, deposit / withdrawal delays, etc
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:03:36
It's the predecessor to the Komodo coin.  The team discontinued the coin for a year now and I believe after this month it's gone.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:19:11
Damn, that sucks.  Hope it comes soon PRONTO as I can smell another bull run either today or tomorrow.  Definitely this week at the very least.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:29:07
Yeah.  The pattern is always Moon &gt; Dip &gt; Raise a little &gt; Consolidation until X days &gt; Moon again, repeat.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:18:34
And well... yeah, it crashed! And a correction. Both happened and like i said, the market did correct itself, every coin dropped. 
But what I didn't see is the recovery is so much faster than the past 2 crashes.  Took months, this time only 24 - 48 hours. It's crazy how different the environment was compare to now. CME futures approval really did help.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:59:13
I still get messages from people saying they are waiting for it to correct back to 5k lol sad
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:53:24
The pattern is BTC rises &gt; Everyone sells Alts back to BTC &gt; Alts all drop &gt; BTC reaches a ATH, everyone goes back to Alts &gt; BTC Corrects X days &gt; Altscoin go up, then sell back to BTC when things look good.
BUT the problem is this whole weekend is nothing but corrections and dips, therefore Altcoins simply need more time to go up.  This vicious cycle is about to repeat this week is what I'm saying.  We Alt coin hodler's are in a losing battle
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:42
Coinbase just crashed lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:21
Even I have to admit something is going on behind the scenes.  Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase caught me and probably most investors off-guard, causing BTC to tank and Cash to skyrocket.  If I didn't check Blockfolio at the right moment, I would've been blindsided
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:28:25
Just when we all thought the recovery last night FINALLY will happen... then this shit happened.  Fucking whale sellers ruining things for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:24:50
The "8k" drop you mentioned already happened during the crash.  You literally only have 2 seconds to lock it in before it went straight up above 9k, 
With CME futures, this type of flash crash will be less likely.  Unless another crash will be happen, anything under 9k probably won't happen again after dec 18th.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:24:59
TLDR: Legitimizing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:46
Told all ya'll to cash out now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:36:19
it's funny when it happens to others.  But when it happens to yourself, suddenly its not funny.
The human emotion 101.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:15:31
Correction coming sooner or later, Your telling the man to buy at the ATH? lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:38:09
A very expensive lesson. If i were him, I would take my losses and leave the crypto space for a period of time.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:59:53
Now he is laughing his way to the bank!
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:34:03
Suddenly, all my investment mistakes seem minor compare to this dude.  A moment of silence for him.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:40:10
For sure, 7k is within reach and dare I say.. 7.5k by tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:28:50
$85,000 bruh, not $85.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:27:52
I want to see the look of horror when B2X went from 1.3k to $300 in 1 second.
Not to be morbid but do you think he's drinking himself to death now? LOOL
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:37:59
Sold out @ 10,400.  now it's 11,500.  This is NOT healthy, a reckoning is coming.  It can't go up forever.   2 Things are gonna happen.
1.  BTC Crash.  If this continues, the market will massively correct itself and everything falls.  We've seen it before.
2.  It needs to correct NOW. What's next 12k? 13k? When will it end before everything avalanches.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:13:59
Only thing I'm afraid of is a mass sell off once it hits 10k and the price tanks like hell.  I know HODL but its not like I can wake up at 4 am suddenly and check Blockfolio lol
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:29:21
Agreed.  $25k is too much for a newcomer, you should settle down with triple digits first to test things out.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:42:19
Yeah, tether.  But the fact it got hacked and btc suddenly drops $500 tells me the market overreacted and didn't get their facts straight.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:17:11
Dude I just asked the same question here lol:
But if your asking for a stop loss, 9500 is a good number.  Expect the unexpected right?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:31:26
The sell-off was almost instant.  NO warning signs either, as soon as the news 2X was suspended it was already too late.
Poor dude.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:05:12
I agree, 10k is within striking distance.... man... this is insane
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:30:08
Suddenly, me buying ETH @ 400 at the peak and hodling doesn't seem so bad.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:44:47
Goddamnit, I live in NYC, I wanted to do this secretly not telling my friends and family... now everyone knows... ahh well.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:29:18
Bitcoin has gone through 7 years of bullshit, fake news-ing, Doom and gloom, death predictions, just to get where it is now,  and your telling me a little hack would suddenly destroy it? C'mon people lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:12:26
Yeah i know lol.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:43:54
This is not good.. it's a bad bounce and if it continues, we will see people give up on btc (for now) and go back to Alts.  NEO being @ 34 tells me they are putting money into other coins.
The next 10 hours are crucial.  It is currently in a bear zone now.  
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:38:43
How many times did we use the Vegeta 9000 meme? Felt like we used it 5x already this year
