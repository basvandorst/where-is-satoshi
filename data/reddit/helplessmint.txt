@_date: 2017-12-06 16:54:12
Great website, highly recommend 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:13:40
This is the best technical analysis I've seen in a long time 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:53:16
I think this explains the dip. European sell orders at 10k :) 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:07:19
I think so, it adds up!

So the millions of Google searches on how to buy bitcoin and new coinbase users are all institutions!? We must be doomed! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:39:00
Hopefully he uses this money to help promote bitcoin the right way even more! Bigger conferences, talks, promotions etc 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:34:13
Just look at Google trends, wallet creations, bitcoin transactions and coinbase new users. The people are buying bitcoin. Hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:22
YouTube search his channel and watch some videos. You'll come back so much more educated on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:36:25
Fuck. Sounds like you need a dip to cure your extreme hodling symptoms 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:18:12
Hit 10,000 euros 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:35:25
At least you won't be that someone saying imagine I got in at $10,000 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:48:45
I don't think it's CME directly, just alot of weak hands. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:24:53
Goodmans? 
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:22:10
Who knows!? $1m the top? I remember the same panic and feeling this time last year when price dipped before the segwit fork. Few weeks after we all wished we had "bought" more! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:46:28
Spot on lad 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:10:07
I fucking love reddit 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:33:03
Don't worry I just brought some BCH. It'll plummet now. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:22:52
If you look at the charts. There has never been a bad time to buy bitcoin. Apart from a few hours ago..........
In all honesty. 75% BTC, do your research on some popular alt coins and spread a few for long term holds.
Don't day trade, you'll never win. Seriously. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:24:44
Spot on. Probably made profit from alt pump to buy the dip they created too. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:12:50
Watch this;
The video shows an ethereum example but you can spend different currencies using the card/app this project sets to achieve. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:03:50
I don't care about price, as long as BTC memes are better than BCH memes I'm happy. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:51:56
We're officially at war hahaha 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:19:02
Love this! Congratulations 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:18:11
Just like gold... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:20:01
Coinbase is trending on the app store today. I'm going for Early Adoption but only at the beginning of that segment. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:47:55
I think this time the real concern is people are worried they're holding the wrong coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:08:23
He's already one of us. Welcome 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:39:41
I think it's too big a leap for them right now. We know how people love to troll the market with news. However, they might start accepting bitcoin for gift cards and/or prime subscriptions to trial it out. That would be very cool. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:56:42
I've seen loads of new user activity due to the ATH news this past week. If most these users which I suspect are using Coinbase and other popular exchanges, they'll be waiting for purchase limits to increase. I expect another big rally when the mass of new users are able to purchase bitcoin more easily! 
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:10:20
What a waste of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:12:24
I used to check Facebook all the time, now I just constantly check coin market cap. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:39:04
Old news now
