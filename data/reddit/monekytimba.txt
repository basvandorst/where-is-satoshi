You should have used -&gt; T-R-E-Z-O-R

What fork? Its just another altcoin...
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:02:09
The decentralization is  obviously not for you.

He will pay for the party with our money from MtGox
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:30:51
Should have used Trezor to avoid issues

Whats the point of anonymous bitcoin? Cant cash out large sums without KYC. Lets start KYC and prepare for take off...or not.

Sir, your buttplug is ready.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:57:52
No, because according to investigation, there were ZERO funds on MtGox bank accounts.

I just tried it, works just fine. Although, the gesture based interface confuses me a little. The fee is like 4%, correct me if I am wrong. Anyway, good job. This app seems to be the FASTEST way to buy bitcoins up to $100.

My questions are:
1. Why was Roger Ver lying about mtgox being solvent?
2. What is the relationship between Roger Ver and Karpeles? Are they family related?
Thank you

Question for you: Will Paypal keep my paypal account untouched? I know bitcoins are forbiden on ebay and I think paypal does not like it either.
Thank you
@_date: 2015-08-29 23:21:00
He just does not recognize the value of money. You know, Karpeles must have been very generous if Ver throws away 100k for shitty product. Back then he was crying for $50...today 100k means nothing
@_date: 2015-08-28 10:56:48
Roger Ver also said: MTGOX IS FINE, so I am sure this time he is not lying. LOL
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:35:22
LOL +1

All I can say is FUCK THIS FUCKING SHIT! I chose to be paid in BTC when filling the claim. Not in some fucking YEN! FUCK!

Dont behave like he hurt your feelings. Its just a business, a business does not have emotions. Dimon played you well.

@_date: 2017-07-15 16:30:50
I am proud I have not commited suicide yet....
@_date: 2015-11-30 21:02:00
Your way of securing bitcoins is just so outdated... You were given the most elegant solution ever = buy TREZOR!
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:34:49
People, PLEASE! 
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:02:38
We were ass-goxed :,-(

@_date: 2017-06-28 09:08:10
