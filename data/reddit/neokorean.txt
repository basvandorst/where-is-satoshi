I would only use it to place an order using a credit card. It's instant, but it allows you to catch a dip fairly quick if it ever happens.

Source?

I've been taking a look at IOTA, but that's another one that is pretty popular right now.

No, this is what day traders do as their full time job.

This growth is insane and scary to look at. Something is going to happen soon....

So when does GDAX open trading on Bitcoin Cash? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:07:44
Is it free to transfer your bitcoin to the Ledger from GDAX and vice versa? How long does that transfer typically take? Also, does this mean that if you want to sell the bitcoin you have to transfer it back from the Ledger to the exchange and will that take a few days because that would suck cause what if it is 17k today, but 10k the next, then your sol unless I'm missing something here. And what about other currencies like IOTA? From what I've gathered it doesn't look like that can be stored on the Ledger.

Putting money in Bitcoin is literally putting your money into something of pure speculation. So it's gambling at that point. However, since you're 17 years old I won't say that you shouldn't put it in there because you're young. Young people can afford to lose money, your dad can't. Your dad is correct in saying that he knows a lot more than you because he does indeed have more experience. However, no one can tell you whether or not this is something that will stand the test of time because again it's pure speculation.

The spread on GDAX is absurdly high wtf.

I'm trying to figure out GDAX a little bit. It definitely feels a lot like a normal stock trading platform, but BTC is strange in a sense that it can be bought in fractions. It seems the way you want to go to avoid the taker fee is always use limit orders, but I'm still trying to figure that shit out.

I remember people talking about bitcoin years ago back when it was around $300-$400. I didn't think much of it since it was a bit beyond me and I was too young anyway for it to matter, so I'm giving it a 2nd look. These gains seems completely surreal and insane. So I'm considering dropping $2000 into this since its money that I'm willing to lose that won't affect me at all. The volatility of this currency is something I've never experience firsthand before (I just witnessed BTC going from $10k down to $8k within like 20 minutes and it crawled back up to 9.8k in like the next 5 minutes), but I'm all about high risk and reward. I've been brushing up a bit on BTC, ETH, and LTC. I'm setting up Coinbase and GDAX atm and doing further research.
Is there anything I should know before making a trade on this and do a lot of you do this just to make some quick cash? Because I'm looking at this and it seems a lot of people go that route. I'm personally looking to put some of this in LTC and BTC and diversify and hold for like a month and see where it goes.

General consensus is no, not anymore.
