I'd hope so, this is the 4th day, and reading the experiences of a lot of other people doesn't make me any more positive. People talking about waiting for 30 days without any response. That is very scary indeed.

I have tried to download the authenticator on a new device, but it's not there, so i'm still not able to log in to my original account.
It was not necessary to open a new account, but the option was there, and it was a way for me to buy currency. But what is very alarming that that I still look the same on my picture, and there shouldn't be any issue recognizing me, considering I have pictures on both accounts. So it would take no more than 5 minutes to put them next to each other and see that i'm the same person.
Then they can just disable my original account or something.
If I think about this a little wider, I fucked up yeah, but why even have a support if they won't actually provide support? Isn't that a bit weird?

I have the same issue, mine is also disabled, I sent them all the information they asked me to send, and I've not heard anything since then.
It's very scary to see how an exchange like this behaves. Where they can basically do anything with your account, and then you have no way of contacting them except creating a ticket, and you have to wait for them to respond. They can just ignore, and that's it, goodbye money, forever...
