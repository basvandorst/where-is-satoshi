@_date: 2014-02-26 14:29:03

@_date: 2014-09-11 00:11:46
some guy predicts the future. 
cool. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:15:44
i keep reading this prediction- that one BTC will hit 100K. what's the reasoning behind this?
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:38:34
cool, thanks. i've been mining doge for a bit, but i've been thinking about mining prime or namecoin soon. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:54:29
well, shit. i don't have any BTC mining hardware. oh well!

wait.  is this guy retarded?  seriously.
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:52:15
oh, of course. i've seen no fact-based numbers yet. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 03:01:12
this is exactly what i've been dying to see.
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:01:05
evidence for the holder buy out?
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:38:19
wow, i never thought about that. 
i've been wondering about the 51% attack for a while now, thinking that computing power is proportional to money, and money clumps together, and therefore so does computing power. if a powerful entity decides to "take control" of the BTC network, there will be millions, if not billions, of nodes in the network prepared to continue with a non-manipulated block chain.  this is the kind of stuff wars are fought over. 
really interesting. thanks for that thought. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:26:52
thanks for your response. 
if you had to speculate wildly, what do you think the "stable" value of one BTC will be, and in what year?
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:11:38
how come?
@_date: 2015-07-19 18:32:36
@_date: 2015-07-02 02:15:25
