Well that was my question, but I don't see IOTA as a form of general currency - just like I don't see ethereum as general currency. Bitcoin at least is strictly for P2P transactions - albeit with problems.
Maybe I'm just too restrictive with my expectations for software use cases.
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:28:48
It is.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:59:26
So what do people use to transact instead?
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:24:18
I'm suspicious of this behaviour. Any hacker who intends to cover their tracks would use an anonymous coin. This whole "bitcoin is for hackers" smells like bullshit PR stunts the more I think about it.

Tell them it's magic internet money that grows on digital trees.
Honestly, don't hodl people's hands.

The number of characters that you left exposed has 4.7e42 combinations. Considering the number of total transactions throughout the history of bitcoin probably doesn't number more than a trillion (1e12). Subtract the two and you will get close to the odds of a near collision. I.e. some form of plausible deniability.
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:01:15
Yeah, but with bitcoin - there is no spoon.
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:49:13
Yeah but you can make payments with crypto - I've done it myself. Some places accept them. I thought that was what you were meaning, that people were using some other coin - like Litecoin.

What type of numbers are the product of the key derivation function in asynchronous cryptography (D-H)?

I'm glad I wasn't the only one who thought that. At least he's come to his senses.

As hominem. Attack the character of the person, and  not the argument, or at least not the conceptual meaning behind a poorly articulated argument - because you simply didn't know the answer. The answer was a semi-prime.


Autocorrect, and stupidity. It happens from time to time.


Which relies upon mathematical functions. Semantic argument - because you didn't know the actual answer.


Semi-prime. Strawman.. instead of answering the question, because you didn't know the answer.


I never claimed to be anything, certainly not an expert. But the answer was a semi-prime.


Write it down, take a picture, I don't give a fuck.

I don't understand where there isn't a light version for blocks - where a hash of the Merkel root is all that's needed for light nodes, and full blocks can be downloaded at will. Maybe every 1000 blocks are replaced with a hash - leaving only the last 100 blocks intact. Again, full blocks are available at will.
Perhaps there should be some limitations to light nodes to encourage full nodes.

He's right. It is FUD, and China may will be selling off. They are not mutually exclusive.

Not for long. Just saying.

I'm pretty sure that, literally, an average guy called Joe uses email somewhere.   Plus, VPNs are quite common now. No crypto is mainstream yet, it's still early. So obviously adoption is low. Your grandma didn't use the internet in the 80's.

FPGAs allow you to make architectural changes in software. That's not the argument I'm making for ASICs.

God dammit Op. You get me every time. I was like "omg omg someone is selling", and it turned out to be a joke. I like jokes. Thanks OP.

Not everyone is "panic" selling. A lot knew in advance that this would happen, just like they know in advance that it will climb back up.

Yes but which is in firmware, and which is part of the structural architecture of the chip? Obviously bus widths, instruction set, and register sizes would be optimised for the chosen hashing algorithm, but the logic to determine the much of the function of the chips would be in microcode. Meaning it may be possible to reprogram them and still make use of SHA-n optimised chips.  
In my amateur opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:31:07
Yeah, but come on.  Chopping kids up to sell as dog meat isn't a libertarian value, nor freedom. There are still laws in free market capitalism.

And then back to 4k. Weeeeeeeeee

Yes but it's literally: fear, uncertainty, doubt. People may use it in a context that implies misinformation, but that's not its definition.

You're more experienced than a lot of people here. Blockchain tech isn't that complex (well, except ETH like contracts), and if you have a rudimentary understanding in cryptography, and some software dev experience, then you will take to it like a duck to water.

You should have published a paper and cited your sources instead.

They already do in places. In some states you cannot collect rain water, building regulations are also strict. Your freedom to live outside of their narrow definition of life is severely restricted. Something MUST change. They're starting to censor the internet, and don't forget that Uncle Sam is listening. The UK is exactly the same.

Bitcoin is being destroyed from within. If you can't attack the crypto, then attack the people.

Bitcoin will probably go down in price a bit for the next week or so, do not panic. It will come back up.
Bitcoin is good for a store of value, and my own projection is that it will double a few times over the next 4 years. So, not mad returns on $200 but  that's an acceptable amount to risk. What I'm leading to is that you may also want to look at some altcoins to invest a small amount in, for considerably larger returns, but a considerably larger risk. Neo is one of my choices, and recommend by a few. There are hundreds, lots are not good, but some are gems.
