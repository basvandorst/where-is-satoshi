*But Google is so hard to use*

Now hear me out on this, what if we had an organization that could advocate for those rights in helping to have them officially recognized? And maybe that organization can have a handy website that can inform the public so it becomes clear.

It would help even more if people took 5 seconds to research something instead of just assuming. And again it's just a mission statement. It's not supposed to outline their specific operating procedures or pick a word out of the dictionary that best defines them.

What's confusing about protecting the rights of software users?

It's a mission statement not a spoon-fed information breakdown for people with pre-conceived notions.

Is there anything confusing about that?

Backed by what?

A handful of companies exploded but being able to pick an Internet startup is harder and much more expensive than a needle in a haystack.

Or do we have a warlord based system like Somalia?

Should we sweep the money he took from the Koch Brothers under the rug as well?

So that's a yes to Blackwater running a military?

It's not an extreme when it's a possibility. Hypothetical success is the same as the hypothetical shortfalls. How about national defense? Private contractors? Blackwater is sure known for accountability and their professionalism along with transparency.

So if I miss a payment to the fire department my house can burn down?

Imagine the US with no highways. Private funding didn't cover that.
@_date: 2014-08-09 05:16:46
It's not above and beyond, it's a basic amenity. What about fire departments? 
@_date: 2014-08-09 02:31:37
As much as taxes suck, I like my roads and my PBS and my fire departments.

With their billions of dollars? Yes I'd expect so

[Reading ]( is hard, isn't it? Learn for yourself.

But cryptocurrencies already have that.

The least you can do is be informed about how Bitcoin works before spouting off nonsense like that.

Let's face it, they shot themselves in the foot that time by using Bank of America in the first place.
