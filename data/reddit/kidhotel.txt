Not if they have $100m in bitcoin but $1b in futures

Personally I believe that a lot of large firms have been gathering bitcoins for a while now and all at once are going to short btc and sell off all of their supply, crashing the price but making them a fuck ton of money

Not yet. Looks a lot less likely now but then again pump and dumps are illegal so they wouldn't just offload all at once.

Same. Not a shot that I'm about to gamble on the 50/50 shot of large firms either crashing the price for profit or hodling.

I'm in highschool and I've had tons of people ask me about how to do it in the last few days

Personally, and obviously this is speculative, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it dip below 5k before it comes back up.

Obviously but he also wouldn't invest in it if he didn't truly believe it right? Like he wasn't given a bunch of investments and then told "justify this."

Stop is to stop you from losing too much (sell if it drops a lot or buy if it shoots up) and limit keeps you from losing profit (sell when it hits a certain price above where it is now or buy if it drops dramatically)

It is a factually true statement that the deflation of bitcoin relies solely on memes.

Sell and buy in 10 mins when its 7k

A few sells snowball and then they hit a limit wall and bounce back and then those limits sell and it goes back down and it bounces around there for a while

Are we back boiz
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:55:55
I'd like to know more about this too.

Multiply it by 5? Tf

You can buy or as much as you want. From .00000001 of a coin to 100,000 coins. Each one is around $10,000 right now.
