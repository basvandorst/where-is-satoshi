Generally good - although this comment is off-base,


There's unlikely to be any price stability. It's a good thing that price stability is not that important if you want to use BTC to trade rather than as a store of value or a unit of account.

Krugman asks "What's new about Bitcoin?" and then proceeds to answer his own question stating that what makes Bitcoin different is that it has a fixed supply. This is true but the revolutionary breakthrough is that transactions don't require a third-party.
This shows that Krugman, like many Bitcoin detractors, does not fully understand Bitcoin. 
He also frames Bitcoin as a competing monetary system rather than as a complementary one. He's correct that the US Government should not adopt Bitcoin (he really wants to say Gold) as its official monetary system because of the huge fluctuation in value of the fledgling currency. He sure knocks that straw-man down easily!
I hope he revisits Bitcoin after he does his homework properly. He does understand that the purpose of a monetary system is 'to facilitate transactions' and this is where Bitcoin excels.

That's if you're prepared to fully investigate and understand the argument. If you don't have the time for that, you'll often accept the view of an recognized expert or a majority of experts. 
I'm just pointing out that those guys are not recognized experts - one might have taken than meaning.

This is the nature of speculation. Speculators help a currency or commodity by giving it liquidity and helping it to find its market value. Speculation and hoarding are nothing to worry about.

My perspective is that there is no pump-and-dump involved, and so understood your pejorative comments to be aimed at legitimate speculators.
In order to substantiate a claim of 'pump-and-dump' you'd need to show 'false and misleading positive statements' and people making speculative investments based on them, and others selling based on a knowledge of this.
The volatility earlier this year could be fairly described as a speculative bubble, or a speculative mania. Sure it was driven by greed, but it was not driven by deception.

My parents used to tell me that house prices would only ever go up and I should 'buy now before it is too late!' Were they trying to pump-and-dump me? No, these are just statements typical of a mania.
A pump-and-dump would be if someone told you that they had inside info that the US Gov was soon to be adopting BTC as the monetary standard. 
Nobody was claiming to have inside information, nobody was claiming to be unbiased. Those are the hallmarks of PaD.

They aren't recognized economists. They're members of Quora.
