A bounty for what? Returning the coins or providing a name for the hacker?
If the latter, why would anyone bother paying when they still need proof the hacker (a) exists (b) is solely in possession of the coins (c) carried out the attack by themselves?
You'll need to provide a lot more details... right now, you've got nothing.

it's ironic that this very community was ridiculing Ethereum DAO investers for investing in something they didn't do due diligence on and then claiming it was wrong of them to be 'bailed out' by a hard fork... the general view was they should accept the losses and learn from it..
couldn't the same logic be applied here? i.e. Bitfinex was hacked therefore it must not have been secure and therefore users just made a bad investment decision to keep BTC with Bitfinex (given that they didn't check the small print where it says Bitfinex accept no liability for customer losses)?

The Greek government are effectively playing chicken with Europe and are literally prepared to kill their own economy.... or at least that's what they want the EU to believe...
In reality, once people see the value of their savings drop, don't get paid from their employer and see civil unrest on the streets, they'll want to put back in to power a government that simply brings stability - they won't care if that means incomprehensible debt, so long as they've bread on the table, a roof over their heads and peace on the streets.
What Europe is demanding is reasonable... simplification of the Greek tax system and bringing their spending and social welfare system in line with the rest of Europe. 
If they were to show themselves to be agreeable, grateful, trustworthy partners in Europe, they might stand a better chance of renegotiating debt upon hitting certain targets.
Anyway, all of this nonsense just highlights the value of Bitcoin. It's a ridiculous situation to be in where the Greek people can't access their own cash because their government decides to ration it overnight without warning.

but do you not think that most people prefer convenience over anonymity? imo, the cryptocurrency that will succeed is the one that generates mass adoption... 
paypal for example isn't a particularly wonderful online payment service, but because of the sheer volume of people using it, it becomes the go-to online payment service for fiat currency... helped by ebay of course... but don't forget Stripe are funding Stellar so Stellar immediately has a route to market quickly (not now, but in the future)..
it could be argued that stellar is like a 'fee free' paypal but also happens to have it's own currency... you're right in that the stellar currency by itself isn't particularly different than any other, but you can't ignore the kind of astronomical growth that's around it... 0 to 250k users (and that's just Facebook authentications) in a week...
the problem of course is that you can't really use these stellars anywhere but given the fact it's a week old, i'm sure there'll be a lot of innovation around it very quickly... because right now there are 250k people holding currency with nothing to spend it on... so the first few useful services / games  / tools are going to be milking it...

but more importantly, faith in bitcoin destroyed... if the world's largest exchange has been corrupt and / or existed for so long with an undetected security issue allowing someone to access coins for so long, i don't believe it will be the last such event...
also, if 700k coins have been stolen, that means we're all effectively propping up criminals and criminal activity (and not just as a small percentage of the market).
finally, this proves there's a need to regulate and a need for insurance... bitcoin will not bounce back from this otherwise imo.

Tomorrow, you may change your mind when Apple announce proper mobile commerce...
NFC and the idea of paying for things with a phone is not new... the Japanese have been doing it for years, but when this shit gets announced tomorrow, Apple will get full credit for introducing 'groundbreaking' or 'revolutionary' technology...
And when the world starts using their phones as a wallet, soon, Bitcoin as a financial platform won't seem so scary or alien.
Most people don't know how computers work or how phones work... or cars... cars are a great example... people don't give a shit about engines and cylinders and coils - they want something that looks good and is comfortable to sit in / drive.  If it stops working, they don't simply sell their car and go back to walking or taking the bus... because the convenience factor is too valuable...
right now with Bitcoin, we're in Henry Ford times where we've got no reverse gear, few roads and no safety whatsoever... i'm sure that people called cars stupid or impractical or too complex for the modern day man etc... 
as the man himself said "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said ‘faster horses.’"..
it's the same with transactions / banking today... ask people what they want and they'd tell you 'no transactions / fees on our existing currency or transfers between currencies'...
@_date: 2014-08-08 09:26:57
but that's like saying a retailer makes no sense because customers can just buy directly from a manufacturer...
whilst all of us believe in cryptocurrencies, most of us would agree we still think in fiat and use fiat on a daily basis... the value of Bitcoin is measured ultimately in how many dollars it's worth on any given day.
to me, Bitcoin hasn't gone mainstream yet... it hasn't gone viral like farmville or a 'Charlie bit my finger' youtube video... Stellar is doing that at the minute... over 300k+ signups now and the fact people can get coins just for signing up and using coins, incentivizes them to make transactions and invite friends... we're gonna very quickly arrive at a situation where Stellar is the largest cryptocurrency by owner numbers and that will make it the biggest threat to Bitcoin so far imo...
long term, it would be easy for Stripe to integrate Stellar in to it's payment network and with Stripes' existing relationships with credit card companies and banks, that gives it a huge advantage over Bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:04:44
precisely... and where is that beautiful, friction-free technology on top of Bitcoin? nowhere... it doesn't exist yet...
and i'd argue it will never exist so long as your 'id' is a bunch of jibberish you can't remember and can't secure easily in a digital format...
Bitcoin will remain the thing which all other virtual currencies derive their value from, but i've convinced myself that Bitcoin itself will not go mainstream... 
and that's ok, it doesn't have to in order to increase in value, but we just have to put our 'mainstream adoption' eggs in another basket imo... 
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:41:53
imo, Gox's collapse means Bitcoin as a currency is no longer viable... it's too big not to have an impact on confidence. So other exchange owners and high net worth individuals who believe in Bitcoin will know that at this stage it's still all about confidence and getting new people to buy in and start trading / using it... 
no new people are going to buy in with news like this... if the other hand, super man comes in and saves the day and the price rebounds to $1k+, then suddenly it doesn't look so sketchy or risky..
@_date: 2014-08-18 17:08:24
for me, it's the threat of something like Stellar... which can get half a million people on board within a couple of weeks..
*if* stellar had a marketplace and more groundwork done prior to going public (something for people to actually trade their coins for), it would have been very dangerous for Bitcoin...
Bitcoin is only valuable because people value it, but if rapid mass adoption can happen with another coin, that's a potential killer blow..

But Apple have Apply Pay which will make it ridiculously easy to transfer fiat currency from customer to retailer or (eventually) person to person... 
The only benefit Bitcoin has is its speed of transfer / low friction... if banks improve transfer speeds for fiat currency and introduce no transfer fees using certain technology, then the benefits of Bitcoin for an average Joe are not worth it.
Average Joe does not understand private keys and doesn't know how to safely store and transfer Bitcoin - this is the route of the problem.. Bitcoin is NOT user friendly... it's the equivalent of command line interface...
For this reason, i believe other crypto currencies like stellar.org will prosper... because the ecosystem is more user friendly.. you have a username and password, you transfer funds to a username... you receive funds to a username... it's not as anonymous but people don't want anonymity is it means hassle. Right now, Bitcoin is hassle.
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:11:34
well, let me put it to you another way... a few dollars on transfers or a small % here and there might not mean a whole lot to you, but it's the poorest in society that are hit the hardest by banks...
in my country, you get fee-free banking in several banks if you have over €2,500 sitting in your account permanently... or in some cases if €3,000 passes through your current account in a month... if you're not that well off, you end up with fees of about €12/quarter...
so for example if you put €100 in a bank account today and do nothing else, you'll end up owing the bank money in just over 2 years... or if you're working here and can save €100/month and want to send it back home to Vietnam or somewhere remote / outside the EU, that €100 will end up being the equivalent of about €70 by the time the banks take their cut for sending it and then converting it...
is that fair? hell no... and pretending this isn't a problem or doesn't need to be addressed is only highlighting how out of touch some people may be with how the world trades and how difficult / expensive it can be to trade for huge numbers of people... not just in 'third world' countries...
to accept credit card payments anywhere you generally need a merchant bank account, a business bank account and a terminal... all of which cost monthly fees.. which can cripple a small business as they all add up... the point is if everyone used Bitcoin, those fees would be completely unnecessary. It won't happen overnight and Bitcoin may not even be the solution, but the protocol / technology / concept will play a role in shaping that future where banks get less of a cut / no cut at all from the consumer to consumer transaction... which let's face it, is the way it should be...

the world's largest exchange of a booming new currency going bankrupt makes no sense whatsoever unless of course there was/is corruption at the top...
also, Gox has over 1m customers on its books so simply wishing they'll disappear and everyone will stop talking about them is poor form from redditors here not giving a toss about the little guys who may still have coins / cash tied up in Gox.

you've been brainwashed by the propaganda on here... this time 12 months ago people were saying the same thing when the price of a bitcoin was 3.5 times greater than it is today... 
do yourself a favour and look back at the old comments from a year ago when the price was $1000+ 
the reality is this place is full of spindoctors and people with a vested interest in hyping the shit out of bitcoin for personal financial gain... most of them don't give a shit about the technology, they only care about increasing personal wealth... so let's get that straight....
here's a comment on a thread when Bitcoin hit $1000 for the first time:
"A year ago I bought some bitcoins for $10 after spending two weeks reading about this incredible new currency and transaction technology... today one bitcoin is worth $1000 - But it is still extremely early days and 99% of society still doesn't understand how revolutionary this technology is, the world is still filled with mistrust, and not a single government has figured out exactly what to do with/about it. Sentiment is slowly changing to that of support as key people in positions of power take the first baby steps towards understanding the technology, and realise how overwhelmingly positive it will be for what we now know as "money". There is still a lot of resistance too, but universally only from people who haven't taken the time to actually understand what they're talking about. The technology is so staggeringly transformative that money can literally never be the same again, just like the postal system gave way to email. So if that's where we are now, where will we be when 10% of people understand bitcoin? One day I hope we find out, but for now I'm pretty chuffed ..."
this guy was in effect saying "i think you should buy all you can now because it's gonna be worth a lot in years to come..." well, one year on and it's worth ~65% less of what it was... there are a lot of people who lost money and still lose money on bitcoin.... it may be worth $0 in 20 years time... it may be worth $10... or it may be worth $10,000.
However, Bitcoin will not make you rich any time soon, if ever.

Bitcoin is just like Oil, Gold, Houses... etc.. in the sense that it's traded on the free market... the big problem with it (for many) is that it's not regulated nor insured so if an exchange gets hacks and losses everything, it's tough shit and the hackers get away the heist...

But it could be argued that Satoshi is the Bitcoin God and everyone still obeys his original rules / vision / plan... that's partially why there's so much opposition to a hard fork /soft fork / any change at all.
Satoshi's original paper and forum comments are mulled over and interpreted to depth - almost like religious folk interpret the bible in different ways to make it fit with their points of view.
I agree splitting a coin frequently is extremely risky and damages confidence to some extent in the coin. But something has to give if Bitcoin is to retain (or regain) it's dominance... it's pretty clear that both the community and the markets are not content with the current state of Bitcoin.
In my opinion, Bitcoin needs to position itself as *the* store of value and end discussion on hard forks. That would effectively pave the way for other cryptos to battle it out for the role of day to day currency and cement Bitcoin's status as *the* store of value and safe haven in the crypto world both for fiat &amp; when fleeing from other cryptos. 
It wouldn't keep everyone happy, but at least it would have a clear identity and the problems it faces today (e.g. transaction times, high fees) would just be accepted as the premium you pay for the stability / status of using Bitcoin.

It's not silly if it's invested in things which bring you peace of mind or long term security. For example cashing out having made a healthy profit to put a down payment on a house would be a smart move and one you couldn't really regret (given that you'll always need a roof over your head).
Moving in to gold &amp; silver wouldn't be for me but again I don't think I'd regret cashing out at an ATH to diversify in to both - it's not exactly a wreckless move, it's probably the most sensible financial move to make.
Cashing out in to fiat would be my biggest regret if I didn't need the fiat urgently. For example cashing out to buy a nicer car or go on a long vacation is what I'd consider wasteful.

Reminding you 7 days later... we were at ~$965 when I posted, we went up to $1140 and now we're back below $900... ($880 at time of posting this) 
It's impossible to call the precise top and bottom in a dollar value but yet again trusting StochRSI pays off i.e. when it 'red lines', price will drop and when it's on the floor, price will rise.
The problem is making a judgement call as to whether current conditions are 'unprecedented' (i.e. will rewrite history and patterns in the future) or whether current conditions will simply mirror past events.
Because the fundamentals of Bitcoin haven't changed all that much recently (bar perhaps halving), I didn't anticipate an unprecedented rise (not enough real world economic turmoil yet either) so was confident it would play out as per historical patterns. 
What matters most now is being patient and waiting for us to hit the floor on StochRSI before buying more. If history is anything to go by, it could take 2-3 months.

No, you weren't going to buy at 400. You thought to yourself "I won't buy now because what happens if the price goes down?". You thought the same thing at 600 and you think the same thing now.
As some smart dude once said, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take".
But if it makes you feel any better, had you take a shot on every single cryptocurrency at the same time, you'd more than likely be down money overall...

@_date: 2016-12-30 15:45:15
Well it matters if you're trying to pick a good time to buy in... i.e. if you were investing $50k and want to know a good time to invest, now wouldn't be a smart time in my opinion...
The same way if someone invested $50k towards the end of 2013, they'd have less than $50k worth of Bitcoin today...
Nobody likes losing money, even if it is paper losses over a short time period. All i'm saying is that patience and perspective is needed to pick a good time to enter and exit. Entering due to FOMO and when we're at extremely overbought levels is only going to result in pain. And someone who invests emotionally and buys in at a high is equally as likely to make rash decisions when things go south.

Annnd this is why now is a great time to sell... people getting carried away and losing the run of themselves... predicting a 450% price increase within 5 months.

it means they're just starting to get greedy...
@_date: 2016-12-30 11:25:56
It's not a great time to buy if you've done tonnes of research on it... all the technical indicators suggest we're overbought and in for a pullback. Just look at one week charts here: 
You see the StochRSI wave at the bottom? When that maxes out in the red zone, that's a signal the price will drop significantly (if it's been maxed out for a significant period of time). 
This is unpopular but look at the chart and history for yourself... we never spend more than about 3-4 months in a red zone and we're at the end of that period now...
It doesn't mean the price will be cut in half overnight but it means you should prepare yourself for short term losses or if you intend buying more, it's probably worth waiting it out until we go back to blue..
That's of course based on the assumption you place any value in historical patterns which you may not, but I find they're generally a pretty good guide as to what way sentiment is. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 15:56:23
i'd argue you'd need much less than that... there's already shitloads of lost coins and over time that number will increase due to death / carelessness / dementia etc...
it's not unreasonable to think that 10% of all coins mined to date have been lost... especially in those early days when 100 BTC was worth virtually nothing...
just look at how many people forget passwords or misplace their passport / birth cert / any other valuable piece of data...

Yeah this isn't going to happen... people will say they'll do it but the reality is moving coins is a huge pain in the ass for most people and an unnecessary job if you intend moving coins back again anyway... 
I admire the push to make it a thing and bring awareness about how exchanges likely work / how corrupt they can be but most people need a greater incentive to move coins.

There's a spelling mistake in point no.3, sentence number 4 as highlighted below:


According to [Urban Dictionary]( 'belieb' is: 
A verb. The act of believing in Justin Bieber. To belieb is to support and love Justin Bieber for everything he has to stand for. When you belieb you become more than a just a fan, it puts you at a whole new level: a belieber.

It depends how sophisticated the attack is and how trustworthy the hacker is i.e. they might just show the same address to everyone, hope some suckers pay up and then just destroy the data anyway regardless of whether or not they receive funds... which would be pretty shitty compared to the hacker who keeps his word and decrypts the data once payment is received.

what we're seeing at the minute is a Bitcoin rise led by China, because of Chinese capital controls... it's a good indication of what could happen if and when the US market collapses again...
withdrawing money in to banks is no longer a safe bet because interest rates are at zero but more importantly the banks themselves aren't trustworthy... look at what happened in Greece recently (credit controls, restricting people to a maximum withdrawal €60/day)... 
to a much lesser extent, this is what is happening in China... government are basically restricting people from using their own funds however they wish.
if you're in a country that has a situation like this brewing, Bitcoin is the perfect solution in that you have access to all of your funds on demand and don't have your savings held hostage by banks or a government...

that's because the Greeks couldn't access their cash to do anything with it...

I think people would enjoy a double or nothing type of lotto better...
Everyone puts in 0.1 BTC, 49% of them get 0.2BTC back. 
The remaining 1% of funds is stored up for an end of year traditional lottery where 1 person (random address who's entered throughout the year) wins all the 1%'s left over from during the year.
This way, you've almost got a 1 in 2 chance of winning each week... and if you don't win, you've still got a shot at winning the end of year jackpot... 
That system would encourage me to enter cuz i'd be thinking even if i lose this week, i'll win next week or the week after etc...

Because if you threw $50 at every cryptocurrency today, you'd be broke... 
The Ethereum community has already shown they're a community rather than a cold, emotionless algorithm so it's pretty unlikely ETHC will be supported by developers or miners to the extent needed... 
To me it looks like anyone supporting ETHC have a vested interest in doing so and that interest isn't driven by philosophical views or to help the community - it's simply greed or publicity. 
I don't think the hard fork was made for reasons of greed. I think it was made in an attempt to stop greed from winning / destroying the ecosystem... it may be naeive, only time will tell, but I still think the right decision was made and ETH will win out in the end. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 08:31:25
Eh they effectively reversed what was an obvious robbery that impacted a large portion of the community... it would have been similar to the Bitcoin community getting back the lost/stolen MtGox coins..
I'm not sure why you think it's a negative thing... it was done democratically. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 09:48:19
No blockchain is immutable. It's still possible that at some stage Bitcoin could see a 51% attack to change the rules. For reasons of good (i.e. some vulnerability is discovered in existing code) or for reasons of bad (i.e. to create a vulnerability)... 
The key to making any blockchain useful is consensus. It's not a violation of principle to hard fork if the consensus is to hard fork. 
You could argue that both investors, miners and hackers should have done their due diligence and realised this before getting involved - if they think that a hard fork is somehow illegal. The hard fork possibility is effectively small print nobody has read or thought could be possible to execute... 
@_date: 2016-07-22 12:42:50
A social, democratic approach to building a financial system means that because people are involved, they can be influenced by propaganda or bribed in to voting certain ways. That's a given.
But the alternative approach - i.e. a financial system driven by a single algorithm that can't be modified in any way means that when humans fuck up (which they inevitably will do) - whether it be through negligence or incompetence, then they'll have no comeback whatsoever. And if one of these humans makes an honest mistake which impacts of hundreds or thousands or millions of others (i.e. a line of code that enables a hacker to exploit a system), it just doesn't seem fair that everyone gets punished for it whilst the hacker gets rewarded and gets away.
I don't think Ethereum is superior to Bitcoin, I think the two can co-exist but I think Bitcoin *needs* another cryptocurrency to bring cryptocurrency to the masses... and I'm convinced one thing that prevents people from getting in to Bitcoin is this lack of comeback when coins get stolen or an exchange gets hacked or goes rogue (like MtGox). 
It's just bad publicity for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency when something like that happens, the hackers get away with millions, the holders / investors (people giving the system value in the first place) are left empty handed and the devs just shrug their shoulders and say there's nothing that can be done.
@_date: 2016-07-22 11:14:28
There were two solutions: 
1. Do nothing 
2. Hard fork
Ethereum and it's founders didn't take the decision to hard fork and implement it themselves - all they could do was propose it seek approval and adoption by miners. And it wasn't exactly a close run thing either: 
@_date: 2016-07-24 13:05:21
Because your investment could be seen as immoral, opportunistic, enables a hacker to withdraw funds that aren't his etc... plus we just don't know what, if any, incentive Poloniex have to trade ETHC... 
They themselves have been hacked in the past and it was their customers that took the hit... so you'd think they'd be trying to prevent and deter hackers from taking what isn't theirs. But by supporting ETHC they're doing the opposite... 
It could simply be a PR stunt (meant to be innocent or harmless) but in my mind it's just irresponsible...
@_date: 2016-07-22 10:46:15
But it wouldn't be my decision to make, it'd be a consensus decision...
Sure, if i lost coins I'd be pissed and I'd want action - but it would be up to me to influence the community to get them to hard fork.. which is of course easier said than done and will only become more difficult as it grows (just look at the block size debate on Bitcoin).
In Ethereum's case, the hacker was actually trying to pay people not to hard fork - so it's a battle of wills and a battle of good / evil / trust / greed. You have to trust the community to do the right thing and in this case I believe hard forking was the right thing.
I accept it sets precedent, but that's not necessarily a bad thing or a good thing. The ability to adapt and change direction in response to unforeseen events / hacks that threaten the project's survival is not a weakness, it's a strength... it's necessary for the project to survive imo. Hypothetically, had a hard fork *not* taken place and we had another similar event in the near future it would almost certainly kill the whole Ethereum project... at least now there's a chance to regroup, rebuild and try to ensure this never happens again. 
It's all a massive embarrassment of course but ultimately justice has been done and a hacker has not gotten away with a significant % of value and millions of $. It will come at a great expense (i.e. these type of 'it can't be trusted, it's acting a central bank' jibes) but I think we need to concede that in order for cryptocurrency to go mainstream, there needs to be some sort of sensible policing around these heists and personally I'm happy to see this happen (and for the record I held / hold no Ether, only Bitcoin but I'm very interested to see how Ethereum develops from here).
@_date: 2016-07-24 11:46:01
This was a case of one hacker -v- hundreds / thousands of investors. It's not a case of the rich getting richer or a group of elites profiting off the back of the poorest in the community... it's a simple case of a large % of assets being robbed from a large % of the community and something being done about it / action being taken... 
With fiat, the hard fork would involve printing more money (i.e. increasing the number of available coins) and giving the new coins to the victims of theft, whilst simultaneously accommodating / encouraging / legitimizing the hacker's coins.
@_date: 2016-07-22 08:59:57
Why? it's akin to having a finite supply of gold... a significant amount of the gold gets robbed and your view is "shit happens, tough luck"...
If there is a method of stopping the thief from cashing in on the gold he stole and / or returning it to its original owner, isn't that the right thing to do, provided all the gold owners approve it in a democratic vote?
Any reasonable person would come to that conclusion... or looking at it another way, if you saw someone get robbed on the street and the robber was running towards you, would you just let him run past and say "not my problem, these things happen" to the victim? 
I like the fact that ethereum has righted a wrong. It gives me confidence that in the future, should a similar situation occur (i.e. massive theft that threatens the entire system), the hacker won't get away with it as easily as happens with Bitcoin - where if you're unlucky enough to have coins in a hacked or corrupt exchange, you're fucked. Why would you allow / favour innocent people (users and fans of the system) to get screwed over in these situations?
@_date: 2016-07-24 12:45:17


You may not care about what happens to Ethereum or cryptocurrency in general, but a lot of people do. What happens with Ethereum and how this plays out will shape the future of cryptocurrency... it will have a direct impact on Bitcoin (and could prove that Bitcoin acts as a safe haven cryptocurrency in times of uncertainty with alt coins).
But more importantly, we'll learn valuable lessons about hard forks, the aftermath and the impact on supply / demand on the alt coin/s and whether it impacts on Bitcoin too.
Bitcoin price has slid $10-$15 since coinbase added Ethereum... I don't think that's a coincidence (especially since coinbase was leading the way in terms of Ethereum price over the past few days). 
Right now, even on this very subreddit, all eyes are on Ethereum and what happens with it...
@_date: 2016-07-24 22:38:29
With the 'centralised guardians' being a potentially infinite number of decentralised miners... all of whom will be watching and learning from the current shit show and almost inevitably rejecting any future hard fork proposals...
This fork was designed to reverse a large heist... the narrative people are trying to create is that it was a bailout for investors and the Ethereum founder himself... who had a mere 0.3% of all of his holdings in it - which granted, is more than zero, but it'd be moronic to bail yourself and that 0.3% out of a 'bad investment' temporarily whilst almost certainly lowering your net value by many multiples of that immediately after - which is what he would have known / anticipated would happen... (personally I'd have thought hard fork would negatively impact on price to a much greater extent than it has done already..)
Everyone seems to be completely ignoring the fact that the alternative (i.e. not hard forking) would have put 12% of the market in to the hands of an individual who has proven himself to be a rogue actor. That's the one and only reason for the hard fork. And it's completely understandable and admirable in my opinion that it was supported &amp; approved by the community. The only person that got screwed over was the hacker but for some unknown reason the hacker is now being supported &amp; given an exit strategy, possibly by people equally if not more greedy, but lacking the hacker's skillset..
@_date: 2016-07-22 14:29:30
You know this is actually genuinely a great way of explaining Bitcoin -v- Ethereum...
Joking aside, Bitcoin can basically store stuff in history at a given point in time as undeniable proof something happened (i.e. a marriage)... 
But with Ethereum you can store the same thing but make it 'smart' using variables - so the marriage record will always exist but the variables can change i.e. the married 'status' could change from 'married' to 'divorced' if both parties approve it.
@_date: 2016-07-22 09:36:18
If support was 'limited' as you say, the hard fork simply wouldn't have been approved... 
Ethereum's USP is largely smart contracts and the DAO is the biggest example of that (holding a huge % of all ethers too). I've no doubt there are lots of vested interests from ethereum in the DAO but this dilemma would have been akin to the first Bitcoin exchange getting hacked and a huge % of all coins being hacked / stolen / put at risk right from the off...
As an outsider looking in, you don't want to see that... it doesn't inspire confidence and it sends out the wrong message to would-be investors (i.e. if you invest and your coins get stolen, tough). Also as an early adopter / investor / user of the technology, what sort of message does that give you? What happened to rewarding early adopters and looking after users / building a community and all of that jazz? Granted, money is money and holds no emotion but both Bitcoin / Ethereum / all cryptocurrencies *need* supporters and users to grow and become mainstream and if you fuck those guys over constantly (by not doing anything to help them or not listening to them) then eventually the whole project / system will just collapse...
I feel this was a case of dammed if you do, dammed if you don't - they were gonna take flack either way, but this was the right decision to make because it brings justice.
@_date: 2016-07-24 13:37:09
The only individual the hard fork has hurt has been the hacker who stood to gain ~12% of the market...
If that's a hard fork seen as a failure, then so be it - because it protects the integrity of the ecosystem at no cost to any honest actors other than the cost of embarrassment which will hopefully turn to respect and understanding in time... 
@_date: 2016-07-22 23:48:51
so you'd be happy to stand by and watch someone steal $100m without any repercussions whatsoever, knowing that you could, if you wanted to, do something about it...
and yet here you are talking about the 'sociopaths' running / influencing banks and government...
non-developers often talk about how they feel the ability to code is like some sort of superpower - the ability to bring to life an idea and have it impact millions of people almost instantly... cryptocurrency is a bit like that - very few people understand it and use it but us early adopters know its potential and know it is a revolution in the making.
i feel we have a responsibility to use this technology for good - not just because its the right thing to do, but because it will encourage the world to use, adopt and trust it... and lets be clear - we need that happen in order for Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency to grow - that's what this is all about - trying to build a better future for everyone and personally i'd prefer if it was a future that didn't involve (or tolerate) large scale corruption and theft.
@_date: 2016-07-25 10:50:02
judging by the hostility I've seen here, it wouldn't surprise me at all if there was an effort by certain Bitcoin holders to push ETHC in a bid to kill / destabilize Ethereum or else try to make a quick buck by buying in to ETHC and attempting to overthrow the hard fork...
all these posts / upvotes / hostility towards Ethereum on is just helping Ethereum to go through fail &amp; growth cycles quicker than it would otherwise do...

i'd like to share your optimism, but I've been following bitcoin media coverage closely over the past month or so and these are some headlines that have struck a cord with me:
* This company made $3M in 4 days as part of the Bitcoin gold rush
* Is Bitcoin the Next Napster?
* Bitcoin Couple Travels the World Using Virtual Cash
* How to buy bitcoins
* Bitcoin 2.0 is better than gold: the Winklevosses weigh in
* Winklevoss Twins: Bitcoin Worth at Least 100 Times its Current Price
* Bit by bit, Bitcoin emerging as currency of the future
* How the Bitcoin revolution could gain currency
* Bitcoin Could Go To $1 Million
recently in the mainstream media, there's been a lot of 'happy' stories around bitcoin and a lot of comparisons with gold and how it's the 'next big thing'... this is all quite new - bitcoin was always talked up and but not in ways normal people could relate to... the difference now is that imo mainstream media are selling bitcoin as something anyone can get in to and become rich overnight from... 
that is quite true - it *is* a quicker way of making money than traditional stocks at this point in time, but it's quite simply not sustainable and it's my thinking that we're nearing a huge collapse.. all it takes is a minor blip at this stage for lots of recent, uninformed *investors* (because that's what a lot of people are) to think "shit, i'm gambling on something i know nothing about, better play it safe and trade off in case i get completely burned". 
for the past 6 months or so everything has either been pretty stable or incredibly good for bitcoin owners but when you look around and see all the headlines from the past few weeks, it's pretty obvious that the headlines have influenced 'new' investors to come on board which is a good thing, just not at the rate they're currently coming on board at...

I agree it's a pointless move even though I'm pretty sure it's well intentioned. You have to remember that the reason for the hard fork was simply to reverse a 12% theft of the market... so an attack on the ETHC is effectively an attack on the hacker and anyone who supports him... 
In cases like these, a 51% attack or even the threat of one is a good thing as it shows miners aren't simply prepared to mine whatever is most profitable and ignore all other factors... 
@_date: 2016-07-22 14:10:25
He exploited what was an obvious bug for financial gain and then attempted to bribe people to support him and prevent a hard fork. This is not the sort of person you want to protect, defend or support in any cryptocurrency... 
If you see a guy drop $50 on the street by accident and he walks on, do you take the $50 and spend it yourself? You've done nothing wrong after all... yet any decent person would feel a huge sense of guilt and do the right thing by handing it back - governed by their conscience. 
Similarly, if a shop undercharges you by a significant amount, do you say nothing or do you point out their mistake? If everyone went through life exploiting loopholes at other people's expense, we probably wouldn't have cryptocurrency in the first place..

he would take on a sort of heroic / god like status and we could all look up to him... 
if we see all the coins cashed out some day then we'll know he's just like the rest of us...
what would be really cool is that if the original coins were moved, they'd be allocated to random active accounts - so some dude working 20 hours a day in Mali to provide for his family suddenly sees 1 bitcoin in his account which is worth a million dollars.
it would cause absolute havoc and outrage internally across all governments that they can't control it and that a bunch of normal people suddenly become wealthier than them for no particular reason.

having looked and thought about that on a human level, i thought to myself bitcoin actually does make sense... it's not just a pyramid scheme or fake monopoly money - there's a *genuine* need for it and benefits to using it... up until that point, i seen the whole bitcoin movement as a scam and a bubble and whatever else you want to call it... it's easier to do that than to actually learn about it and wrap your head around it's potential...
i do believe there's a lot of new speculators now on board but i also believe there's a lot of tech people who's eyes have been opened - and they won't sell for a quick buck, they're in for the long haul... they may even relish a crash so they can invest further...
if you look at previous crashes and study the articles and general sentiment *before* previous crashes, it's the same sort of doomsday stuff - people giving out about hockey stick growth and how it's too volatile and can't possibly last... they've been proven wrong now about half a dozen times... so if the past is the best indicator of future, then what we're seeing now is at worst two steps forward which will lead to one step back...

oh boy, whilst things are going well now and $340 seems like a bargain, we haven't really seen a large bust since April...
November alone has seen an insane rise... like, off the charts rise... as with anything, it could go on and grow 100 fold over the next month, but we only have to look at the past decade to see the indications of busts...
if lots of people are being advised and encouraged to buy shit they don't need or understand, that means there's a bust ahead in the not too distant future...
i believe in bitcoin, but i also believe we're gonna see several large and painful busts ahead and i'm counting the days until the next one - because the media coverage and the price is off the charts these days and i think a lot of people are just buying to invest based on hype and the recent stories of bitcoin millionaires.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:12:16
don't worry, i know people with IT degrees that can't wrap their head around how Bitcoin works...
when you understand something that you know is really useful / important and going to have a big future, it's massively frustrating when people don't take the time to learn about it and ask questions and just dismiss it as too complicated / technical..
as any great teacher would say, there's no such thing as a silly questions - keep asking and sooner or later you'll become smarter than most people...

what you're effectively saying, although you may not realise it, is that 1 BTC is affordable for a lot of people now and if they buy now there's a chance they'll become millionaires in the future... there's a small chance that may happen but it's not what should be attracting people in to bitcoin... the technology &amp; concept should be...

As an Irish man, can confirm we're home to one of the worst banking experiences in the world. 
Over the last few years, my bank has:
(a) stopped accepting cash &amp; cheques in the bank itself (they did a deal with the post office - so if you wanted to lodge cash in to your bank account, the only way to do so was to go to the post office)
(b) closed down hundreds of local branches and created a handful of 'banking centers'
(c) shut up shop completely last month and are pulling out of the market
A few banks have done similar things, which leaves us Irish peasants with about 4 banking options, all of which are now price fixing. 
In Ireland you get charged per month or per quarter simply to keep your account open. If you have more than 'x' in your account or have 'x' coming in to your account, then you don't pay the fees... Typically it's a balance of above €2000 or else if you have more than about €2000 coming in each month...
So in a nutshell, the unemployed and people on minimum wage pay fees... those who can afford to leave thousands of €€€ in their account don't pay fees.
Irish banks in a nutshell, folks.

but you could say the same about gold or the dollar or stocks in Apple.. if you invest in *anything* what you're effectively saying to yourself is "i think i'll make money here"... why? because you think many more people will pay a higher price than you're paying today...
that's not a ponzi or pyramid scheme, that's just investing in general... the difference with bitcoin is that it trades 24/7 and its one day graphs look like one year graphs in any normal stock / currency / commodity... is that a problem? only if you need stability to make you sleep at night... 
another general rule of investing is that those who take the highest risk get the most reward... so although bitcoin is volatile, it's volatile because lots of people with deep pockets still feel it's a risk worth taking because the technology is in its infancy...
are they right? maybe. maybe not.

**benefits of bitcoin to consumer**
Very low / no fees for transferring currency from one country to another (this is currently very expensive)... just yesterday it cost me €10 + a % fee for the pleasure of sending a sum of money from one country to another. €10 is like 5% of a weekly wage in some EU countries - why would you want to pay that to a bank when you could have it for yourself?
No banking fees - i'm currently charged €20 per year just keep a bank account open. I'm charged €30 / year by a government to hold a credit card and €5 for a debit card... i'm charged every time money goes in to and out of my account... so in short i'm paying banks and governments to store &amp; give me access to my own money. I have no choice but to pay those fees (it's virtually impossible to live in a world now just using cash).
Lower cost of goods and services as it's cheaper for business to accept bitcoin than credit cards... put another way, if everyone used bitcoin, most products and services *could* be ~3% cheaper than they currently are if the merchant passed savings on to the consumer.
**Merchant Adoption**
Don't know if this will happen quickly enough to justify rising price. Nobody knows. But you can see for yourself some savvy business owners are cashing in on the publicity... being the 'first' to accept Bitcoin in a town or city guarantees headlines. 
**Threat of competitor**
Very real possibility and one I've thought a great deal about.. for example what if Apple rolled out an iCoin - surely that would have instant merchant adoption and instant use by a large number of consumers... but the problem with that is it would ultimately be controlled by a corporation and with all the NSA stuff of late, people would be much more skeptical of it. If Visa or Paypal created a cryptocurrency and open sourced it, it would be a big threat but again you have to ask why would they if bitcoin already exists.. it would surely be created in an attempt to have greater control over the economy.
**Real Value**
Throughout history there have been examples of how seemingly value-less stuff has become currency. I'm not going to talk about that stuff but i'll give you examples of currency used when i was a child. Football sticker collections. Every day on the playground, we'd trade stickers to stick in an album. Some stickers were common, others were extremely rare. The rare stickers usually had a shiney / hologram image on them. As you'd show people your available swaps, their eyes would light up when they'd see a 'shiney'... because they were rare. You could exchange multiple stickers or in some cases someone's entire collection for one of these shineys. Try telling kids those things are valueless and mean nothing... 
Because we can't see bitcoin, doesn't mean it's valueless. It's valuable to people right now because they feel there's a need for it.
Extending your logic a bit, the internet itself has no 'real' value. Facebook has no 'real' value. You could argue the dollar has no 'real' value... if you think about it, something is only valuable if people want it... if people don't want it, it's value will decrease, eventually to nothing...

no - i think despite what some people are suggesting, the type of people who own bitcoins right now are not speculators, they're either people working in technology, friends of people working in technology or else shark investors who want to have a piece in everything..
i don't believe the man on the street understands bitcoin or would go to the trouble of buying in - he's probably very skeptical himself because he knows he's out of his depth and it all seems to good to be true.
so i feel the man on the street is still calling bluff... he thinks it'll all cave in but personally i think it can't cave in because the technology is genuinely revolutionary... so barring interference from law makers or hackers compromising a large exchange, i still think the general trend will be upwards. Indefinitely. 
it sounds nuts but we're building momentum on the ground... public awareness is slowly increasing, more merchants are adopting it... there'll come a big tipping point where a lot of wealthy people realise it's not a pyramid scheme once they take the time to learn about it (which i feel most naysayers haven't done yet).
bitcoin will never be immune from day traders trying to play games and out-smart each other so you're always going to have ups and downs, even if the trend is that of linear growth...
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:43:55
bitcoin is not gold... it's a currency... so if you apply that logic to any currency, you'll get the same result...
if you own all the dollars on the planet, a dollar will become worthless as people will find another way to trade because dollars are impossible to get and eventually become valueless... why would they want dollars if only you have control over them?
people need to eat and sleep so if you strip them of a currency they'll find another currency to get by... sex, drugs, professional services etc...

nobody invests in anything to lose money or not make any profit... i think the typical bitcoin investor is in it for the long haul... people will sell to clear debt and rightly so but the heavyweight high net worth investors wont be content cashing out when the technology &amp;amp;amp; adoption is still in its infancy...

i also said "Answer 'no' to either or both (questions) and you're not ready to invest in Bitcoin"...
they are two separate questions and each can have a yes or no answer... if you answer 'no' to any then my mathematically sound formula advises you not to invest due to classing you as a flight risk.  
but seriously, don't invest because you've regretted not investing in the past - that will only end in disaster... you need to believe you're investing in something that's worthwhile investing in and the only way to know if it's worthwhile is to study the bejaysus out of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:39:54

it's quite clear we need to actually see merchant adoption rate catch up though if these kind of rises are to be sustained...

That's a problem for the US government and not one i'd like to be tasked with solving...
The only possible foilproof way of destroying bitcoin's credibility is to buy it in bulk and then dump it... a suicidal strategy because it would cost billions, but it would be worth it to a government if they felt it would save the dollar. It wouldn't be guaranteed to kill bitcoin, but it would burn a lot of people and damage public confidence in it...
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:02:28
Can only speak from my own experience with it but I've had no problems... (only ever traded with people that have 100% feedback)... because of the volatile prices, i'd argue the system actually favours the buyer... 
For example once you agree to buy, you've got about 90 minutes before you have to confirm payment... 90 minutes is a long time in the bitcoin world and the price can go up or down by quite a bit in that time... if it goes up, obviously you gain and will go through with the buy (at a lower price than what it's currently trading at)... if bitcoin goes down, then you could easily cancel the transaction and come back at a later time / date...

not where i'd intended to go with this, but yeah, fuck it... i'll back this analorgy...
it's not necessarily needed by humanity to function, yet most of us couldn't live in a world without it... it's a currency that has stood the test of time because it's something that humanity has and will always want.
the internet is still very young, but there's an obvious need and demand for a global, decentralised, digital currency and i don't think that will go away any time soon... 
ask yourself this - how did people discover sex? now ask yourself why did they repeat it time and time again? enjoyment? to socialise? to improve quality of life? love?
probably a combination of lots of those things and bitcoin has been discovered and adopted by lots of people for many of those same reasons... people believe it makes life better...
To paraphrase Henry Ford / Steve Jobs - people don't know they want certain things until you give it to them. People don't know they want bitcoin until they learn about it and experiment with it and see for themselves the benefits...
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:22:43
But the problem with a government backed currency is that it's ultimately controlled by the government and select banks... who people don't trust...
People would be highly skeptical of a new currency being introduced by any government, not least in the US where they create more debt to get out of existing debt and you've got the whole NSA thing going on too. 
Bitcoin's biggest strength is that it's limited and decentralised. Going in to hyper-paranoid-tinfoil-hat-mode, if a government were to assassinate one or many individuals with control over the Bitcoin project, it wouldn't matter as you need collective buy in from lots of people in order to change the rules. So the only way you can get control is by buying the limited supply of currency... buying enough of it to destroy it (by dumping it having bought most of it). At which point Bitcoin's price would also be sky high...

What i don't like about the article is this line:
"It is important to buy in as soon as possible"
That right there is such a cliché thing to say in any boom cycle that gets people's backs up immediately... it reminds them of the housing boom when people were saying "buy now before it's too late and you're priced out the market"... 
They start asking themselves why is this stranger ordering me to buy something? shouldn't he be *suggesting* it and / or offering neutral advice? i.e. explaining the pitfalls too... What's his agenda? 
I wouldn't recommend anyone buy in to bitcoin unless they actually take the time to learn about it, figure out how it works and dream of potential uses cases... if people buy in just because somebody tells them to, then they're *much* more likely to panic sell when things start to get twitchy...

Easy - it would enable Apple to set up their own exchange and merchants would trust Apple infastructure  / iOS to handle security side of things, so would be more likely to accept coin with an Apple stamp of approval on it.

Clearly, you're not someone from an IT background or with an understanding of programming / development. You talk like this is something that could easily be done by one of those IT hacker people...
The potential problems you highlight are potential problems for *any* currency or bank. What if someone hacked in to a large bank and transferred small amounts of $$$ from millions of accounts? What if someone hacked a large stock trader and bought a whole bunch of penny stocks? 
No technology (past, present or future) is immune from hacking. We've already seen lots of problems with Bitcoins being stolen and seemingly 'vanishing' but in all cases, some simple proactive security measures on the owner's wallet could have prevented the breach of security. 
If you buy bitcoins and store them in a wallet, you could have 10 factor verification on that wallet if you want - it's still not immune from hacking. It's just highly unlikely it will be hacked. 
Hackers will always go for low hanging fruit first and if you've got an account somewhere with bitcoins in it and your only form of protection is a username and password, well then if i'm a big bad hacker, i'm going to go after that account first - because it's a *lot* easier to crack that than it is an account with multi-factor authentication or accounts that are offline...

it's held at $800 for 3 days now, in fact it's looking like a small increase today again...
i'm not sure how we get down to $300 from here... a crash of over 60% would require some massive selling at the minute and i don't think the type of big guns that are in now are the type of people who'll be happy with an ~8x increase on investment (they would have gotten in at between $100 and the current price)...
if you ask yourself who is buying bitcoins at $800, i wouldn't imagine it's clueless people who don't understand what bitcoins are... so for that reason, i can't see why they'd withdraw when virtually every Bitcoin enthusiast believes we're still just in the stone age with regards to what Bitcoin can achieve...

is it not a little too early to be thinking like a millionaire though if you don't actually have that cash sitting in a vault somewhere with insurance and what not?
i mean, bitcoin can half in value overnight so it's possible for a lot of your value to get wiped out so long as you haven't diversified...
if it were me sitting on a fortune, i'd take out enough to live comfortably and reward myself for my investment / luck / patience and at that stage i could live day to day without thinking "shit, it's dropped 10% today, what if it keeps dropping and i lose everything?"...

most people i know have never heard about Bitcoin. Most reports i see from people suggests they don't know much about it. But the more it's banded about the more people will research and when they research they'll understand why it's big (and not just a pyramid scheme waiting to suck them in)...

If i'm stuck on a desert island with 100 people and i control a limitless supply of drinking water, i'm the shit. I can get you to do whatever i want. You must bring me 2 sea shells to gain 1 minute of access to my well.
Within that type of micro economy (which are created all the time for various reasons), anything can become currency and last for as long as the micro economy lives. If you kill me, then obviously the currency (sea shells) lose value and become worthless.
Sex for example is and has been a currency for thousands of years. Families to this day trade girls / women in exchange for status or financial security or in some cases for iPads and other crazy shit.
Bitcoin is not a micro economy... there is no evil leader, there is no detachment from wider society... if anything, 'local' currencies like the dollar and the euro are the bad guys... they're the currencies that shouldn't last... not the things you should be holding up as examples of how to do currencies properly.

don't get me wrong, i could live a wonderful life with $1m in cash but when you're dealing with lots of people for work related stuff you kinda *need* a bank account - businesses generally don't pay people they work with in cash because it's too hard to document and trace back for accountants... 
if you're just a handy man or doing odd jobs for cash, then it's different because nobody will ever look for a receipt from you or ask you for your bank account details so they can put you on a payroll etc... 
if you're in full time employment or have your own business and aren't involved in illegal activity, then it's pretty difficult to live a cash-only life...

Because it's valuable. i.e. we've grown up thinking it's precious and it's something everyone wants. It's used in every day expressions to reinforce this mental relationship... "that place is a goldmine"... it's used in all good hollywood bank robbery movies as the thing every wants and the stuff the bad guys get excited about.... Oil is the same... only it's a more modern form of value. 
We can make anything valuable but it has to be scarce and we have to be able to understand it.
People understand gold. It's simple... it's a colour, it's essentially a special rare type of rock dug up out of the ground. Same with oil. It's black liquid stuff that makes our cars move and heats our homes.
People don't understand Bitcoin, yet... it's a steep learning curve for a lot of people so it will take time.

People are lazy but if they think it's possible for someone to steal their coins online, even with two factor authentication, then they'll consider alternative storage.. only if educated on the risks and shown examples of how and why things go wrong.

I have to admit I've been really tempted to get in to Litecoin seeing the rise soar... but then when you ask why the price is soaring it's pretty obvious that it's just piggybacking on Bitcoin...
I mean it's not like tonnes of new merchants are accepting Litecoin and Richard Branson is bigging it up on the news etc... it's purely people hoping that the price of litecoin will rise so they can dump and make the profit they 'lost out on' with bitcoin...
I believe litecoin will go higher but i refuse to let myself get drawn in to it as i'd be in it for all the wrong reasons... i.e. just in the hope of getting a 100x return on my investment. The difference with Bitcoin is that i actually believe in it and believe it's revolutionary... it's not piggybacking off anything...

but have done a 180 and what changed was the situation in Cyprus earlier this year when banks froze cash and limited access to money... people were effectively rationed their own money by the bank &amp; government... many invested in bitcoin and then i thought "holy shit, maybe there is actually a need for it, maybe it's not just a novelty game..."
i've watched bitcoin with fascination over the past month and can't help but get more and more involved in discussion and debate around it... the more i think about and try to come up with potential reasons why it won't work, the more i realise it's a bloody marvelous invention that *could* actually change the world for the better... we just need more people using it and more businesses accepting it...

Bitcoin trades 24/7... it's effectively a technology which by it's very nature is going to go through 'viral' phases...
All of that means that predicting its price is like throwing a dart blindfolded. Focusing on movements by the hour or by the day is pointless unless you're actually trying to make money by day trading...
I'm guessing most people who have bought in to bitcoin over the past few weeks are not investors... they're tech people who understand the potential of the technology and have just suddenly realised how it could transform the world. 
That realisation hit me back in March - up until that point i'd never taken bitcoin seriously... when i took the time to research it and listen to talks on it, it was a lightbulb moment. It's my feeling that other people are having that lightbulb moment now too because of all the attention bitcoin has been getting in the media.
I also believe the average person doesn't actually know how to buy or sell bitcoin... the process is too confusing, so that's why i feel it's still only tech people investing... and they're in for the long haul because they believe in the technology...

thought this "Regulation and Deregulation of the Internet" paper was a really interesting read from 1997... 
it concludes: "Communications define communities, and communities define politics.  Thus, the breakdown of the coherent national communications system reflects and accelerates a fundamental centrifugalism that will reshape, in time, countries and societies.  We are barely at the beginning of this evolution, and the forces of resistance are only beginning to fathom the impacts."

only to be expected... i think the important thing we can take from today is that we haven't seen a crash...
$800 appears to be the new benchmark as this will be the third consecutive day it's hovered around that mark...

i think November seen a big shift though in how people view bitcoin... there's a lot more belief and debate about it now at all levels, so barring any major fuck ups with some of the large exchanges (i.e. security breaches) i can't see why the price would drop... 
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:37:22
Wrong. Bitcoin's perceived value is based on the fact there are only ever going to be 21m coins in circulation. If there is say 30% fewer than that, then that means the value of the coins in use goes up. So if you own a coin, you're happier. 
Divisibility just allows you to break off smaller crumbs of your coin than you can currently do. But if 12m people own 1 BTC and hold, divisibility is redundant.

I don't know who Peter Schiff is, i just seen his gold card video earlier... but i'll chime in with my thoughts...
I think that what he's saying is dismissive in tone but there's truth to it... bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme but some people might get in to it for ponzi scheme reasons...


If i buy in at $800 now because I've seen the price movement this month and hope to sell at $8000 this time next month, then yes... that's sort of ponzi scheme territory.
However, the creator of this 'scheme' who's sitting on about a billion dollars right now, hasn't cashed out a single satoshi... we've seen on this subreddit over the past few weeks people who are now millionaires who have no intention of cashing out... these people are not cashing out because they believe bitcoin has real value and hasn't reached anywhere near it's potential...
Let's not pretend nobody dreams about making millions... people don't invest $800 in something so they can take out $800 in 5 years time... they invest to make money. However i really don't think the Bitcoin investors today are investing to try and make a quick buck. The sharp rises will have tempted them in, but people aren't stupid - they're not going to throw money in to something that doesn't have any real world value or potential.
Bitcoin has a lot of potential and that's why people are investing... it's getting people excited and offering a glimpse in to the future and it's not too often people on the street have the opportunity to invest in new technology like this.

The masses will see value in something if it saves them money or time or makes their life more pleasurable in any way.
Cars = faster than horses
Planes = faster than cars
Email = faster and cheaper than post
Online Banking = faster than driving in to a bank and standing in a queue
People are lazy. They don't want to learn about cryptography and public / private keys and blockchains and all that jazz. They just want to get money from a to b for the lowest cost as quickly as possible. That's the goal. So do businesses. 
Right now, getting money from a to b in bitcoin isn't easy for average joe. In fact i'd go so far as to say it's beyond him and actually dangerous for him to try and mess around transferring $1000 to someone. There are lots of potential problems:
1. Average joe has barely wrapped his head around two factor authentication... storing bitcoins offline in a paper wallet isn't an option. That's complex. He doesn't know how to do encryption and cold storage and copying to a USB is hassle.
2. Average joe can easily forget his password or wallet after his wife throws it out on that piece of paper he scribbled it on. He's fucked in that case because it's not like you can ring up bitcoin tech support and get your account details back. 
3. Average joe accidentally copies the wrong send address as he tries to send $500 to his son as a birthday present. He presses send, verifies it and his son questions why he dad never gave him anything for his birthday. Joe feels all smug and hip by using bitcoin and feels like shit when he realises not only did it not come through, but he can't get it back and it went to some stranger instead... Joe goes and commits suicide because he feels worthless and betrayed by technology... 
That's what happens today if average Joe tries to use bitcoin... fast forward 2 or 3 years and i'm pretty sure we'll have a smoother process in place. Look around at all the new exchanges / bitcoin related sites and services popping up... 
In the same way people didn't all run out and sign up for online banking when it became available to them, they won't all be scrambling to use bitcoin.. far from it... it will take years for the technology &amp; services around it to mature in to something that is easy to use and understand... 
The first car was not designed to travel across the country... the first airplane was not designed to take 300 people from london to new york in a few hours... the internet was not designed for people to stalk each other and watch videos of cats... so what happens years from now is anyone's guess... when you're looking at bitcoin, what you have to ask yourself is whether it has the potential to change the world for the better. If so, then it's worth backing because we all know new technology can grow and morph in to something beyond anyone's wildest expectations. 
Personally, i wouldn't have said Snapchat or Instagram would change the world for the better or that Farmville would bring enjoyment to millions of people... so i get it wrong... we all get it wrong. There's something about bitcoin though that has a lot of developers and tech people very excited and that's rather unusual imo. It might be because they've all got a stake in bitcoin and just want to get rich, but i don't know many developers that want to just invest in something and live off it... they want to play with it and test it and pull it apart and challenge it and create cool stuff with it...

you're not the first and you won't be the last... as others have said something like an 8 character password is a lot easier to crack in comparison to a 256 bit private key which would take billions of years to crack.

if you can narrow it down by figuring out what settings KeePass uses or if you can remember clearly any digit or character in the password, then that will save some time...

You're talking like this is fact, let's not do that... we're in a "who knows" phase. The price will rise or fall depending on publicity. If more merchants accept bitcoin, more people will know about it. More people will therefore buy it and use it.
If lots of early investors don't spent bitcoin, then the 8 decimal places will start to become important and 1 bitcoin may well equal thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.

You're correct, but you're not judging bitcoin fairly...
If you're talking about intrinsic value, NO digital service or protocol has intrinsic value. Facebook, Google, HTML, Email... it's all just a bunch of 1s and 0s at the end of the day. 
Bitcoin is not gold or 'gold 2.0'... people use that analogy because of the fact that it's mined and limited in supply. That type of talk is a load of bollox and most people know it. Bitcoin is more like a protocol or platform or breakthrough technology upon which lots of useful things can be built. 
It's true to say that it's all 1s and 0s but there are several billion dollar companies that are made up of 1s and 0s these days... these companies are built on top of protocols which are also just 1s and 0s...

i feel it's almost inevitable bitcoin will hit $1k at this stage... it's just physchology... if and when it hits $1k, i think we'll see a lot of people sell and what happens after that is anyone's guess... 
after reaching 4 figures, the next major milestone is 5 figures and so on... so anything could happen once it touches $1k... it could tank back to $500 and flatline for 6 months until the technology is actually used more... you'll have been around long enough to know that anyway...
if were you, i'd sell half / keep half... that way, you'll pay off a large chunk of your debt and it'll feel good, but you'll also still have a bit of excitement in watching bitcoin... if it all ends in tears, well at least it'll still have made a big difference in your life...
i think it's important not to be greedy and not to view your bitcoin as $x until you actually have $x sitting in a bank account...
you're going to be torturing yourself no matter what happens, so my advice is to focus on the present and be a *bit* sensible... if you've got debt and have a huge appreciating but unpredictable asset, then it's tempting to let it ride but there's *always* a chance you'll end up with nothing...
"damn, i was sitting on $100k in December 2013 and let it all go to shit, now it's worth $1k"...

Schiff still thinks it's basically a pyramid scheme... but if that's the case, isn't every market a pyramid scheme? I mean if you're day trading in currencies you buy because you think you can sell at a higher price and vice versa...
it's the exact same with gold... Schiff is basically saying to buy gold now because it's price will go up and you can 'get out' making a profit...
the only difference between Bitcoin and Gold is the volatility and that's not because Bitcoin is a scam or a ponzi scheme, it's because it's NEW TECHNOLOGY with a limited amount of ownership available... it's 4 years old... it's value is potentially mind blowing if it succeeds like other disruptive technologies in different areas have...

you could find these sort of patterns on an hourly basis and you'd be none the wiser...
it's worth keeping in mind that it's a weekend so no bank transfers will be processed until tomorrow... that means no new buyers can enter the system... the rises and falls are from money in the system already changing hands...
last week saw bitcoin get *a lot* of media coverage so there'll be a lot of new money coming in this week... what happens tomorrow will paint a better picture than what's happening today imo... also, i may be wrong on this, but i'd imagine most of the people who have bought recently are in for the long haul so it's unlikely we'll see them sell to make a few quid in the short term...
i'd expect the price to either level off at $700-900 or just keep going... but i do think if and when it hits $1k it's going to a bit of a crazy day because that's when a whole bunch of psychology kicks in... 4 figures -v- 3 figures... nearing the price of gold etc... that's when the market effectively has a big decision to make...

that's actually pretty cool in fairness...
but i like how he gets excited and starts thinking of possible uses like using them in supermarkets or buying gas... imagine if he was a developer that had just discovered bitcoin...
whilst it's cool, it's obviously not practical - if a tank of gas comes to $67.53, what do you do? give him 2 blocks and do yourself out of over $30? you also need to physically hand it over to someone...
with bitcoin, you could drive up to a gas station in a car, have the pump display a QR code of the price and pay the exact amount from your phone... 
or... OR.... you car could have it's own wallet inbuilt... you pump it full of gas and it automatically deducts the price for you... you just tap on a screen to confirm or something...

if you're an investor, buy bitcoin now, then piss off for a few years and come back to see what you have.
if you're someone who wants to use bitcoin to actually trade and buy stuff, then accept it on your website or ask website owners to start accepting it... proceed to spend it and explain it to people and ideally develop your own service / brokerage / app or something that adds value to the bitcoin movement... you'll be rewarded if you do (because what's out there is shite at the minute - be it exchanges, apps, bitcoin news sites etc..).
most reasonable people would never have expected bitcoin to come this far... the fact some real, proper businesses are accepting it and it's being talked at senate level shows that it's on the radar and it's a now a legitimate potential game changer. it's not simply being laughed at or dismissed by everyone... most people see the value in it, once they actually know how it operates (which is still much too complex for the man on the street).
it's not guaranteed to take over the world, but there's a small chance it could go mainstream and become the most used currency online. if that happens, it will be a kind of industrial revolution never seen before and people are beginning to get excited about that, even though the chances of it happening are still extremely slim.

Yep, i've been waiting for this to happen... Vegas is a tourist magnet so you can guarantee whatever casino is first to accept BTC will get a lot of marketing out of it...

Agree entirely, not only is a crash highly likely but it's badly needed to teach people to be cautious... it's amazing how deluded some people are when they think the value of something will keep rising indefinitely just because since they've owned it, its value hasn't fallen.
I'd hazard a guess there a quite a few bitcoin investors who don't regularly invest or are detached from normal global markets and watching prices of oil, gold etc rise and fall over years... (even if a general trend is upward you never get consistent hockey stick growth in anything)...
i don't have much bitcoin, but i do intend buying when confidence starts to get low and investors trade off 'just in case' in the middle of a crash.

just buy bitcoin for whatever $500 currently gets you and then forget about it for a few years...
if you look at the price daily you'll probably panic and cashout if it drops 50% in a day after some negative headlines...
it's volatile at the minute but with all of these good news headlines / exposure i fear it'll become even more volatile as the market trades on every Richard Branson or US senator comment etc...
just my opinion but i also don't think it's gonna go below $500 again... not unless we have a massively damaging regulation related new story.

"Lunlun Zou Guzheng Studio is the first business in Hong Kong to accept Bitcoin and hopefully will serve as a catalyst for many surrounding businesses to begin accepting Bitcoin. Guzheng is a 2,000 year old musical instrument from China with 21 strings and serves as the predecessor to the Japanese koto, Korean kayagum and Vietnamese dan tranh. Lead teacher, Lulun Zou, has performed around the world and through her new decision to accept Bitcoin will certainly have a positive impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

I get that, but think about Joe Soap on the street who reads that article and then reads your comment...
The message is "Buy now before it's too late"... Bitcoin enthusiasts / owners shouldn't be saying that...
They should be educating people on Bitcoin and then letting people make up their own minds up... most reasonable people will come to that same conclusion but the big difference is they'll actually understand and believe in what they're investing in - they won't sell when they see the price is down 5% two days in a row and read a Warren Buffet article calling Bitcoin fools gold...
Discussion around Bitcoin should be centered on the power of the technology and potential use cases, not about how to double or triple or get a 100x return on your money. Sure, people have done that but if we keep prefixing Bitcoin articles with those type of examples then it's giving the wrong impression and attracting the wrong crowd...

nail on the head... people are talking as if it's value is going to be linear... 
you can't simply stockpile a currency and watch its value rise indefinitely... it defeats the entire purpose of bitcoin (or any currency) if people don't use it to buy and sell stuff...
bitcoin can only work long term as a currency, but it's in danger of becoming an investment vehicle... we need more busts to knock that mentality out of greedy hoarders.

i think he's wrong to just assume most bitcoin transactions are for drugs, prostitution, weapons etc... first of all, it's a wild speculative guess unless he has facts to back it up, but more importantly it's sending out the wrong message...
if you're talking about the dollar, you don't talk about bank robberies and extortion, tiger kidnappings, how people are using it to buy drugs on sidestreets and gamble on illegal dog fights etc... 
you talk about the economy and price of gold and chinese demand etc... there's far too much attention and time given over to bitcoin's shady side, which nobody seems to be able to produce facts or evidence on... 
if someone can prove a significant % of the things people buy with bitcoin are drugs or weapons or something that's illegal to buy with a dollar - then show us FFS and stop talking as if you know something other people don't...
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:56:24
let's not get carried away here.. it was merely talked about for a half an hour by a bunch of powerless middle management guys and the conclusion was basically "eh yeah, that looks interesting, let's see how it pans out"...
look at bitcoin as a social network... is it *the* ultimate social network? we don't know yet because not everyone has been exposed to it... we think people will like it but i also think lots of people won't like it or won't even spend time thinking about it in it's current state - because it's still rather geeky with poor infrastructure and unreliable services around it.

if somebody wants to start using bitcoin now, they're banking on it's value increasing indefinitely, otherwise it's not worth buying, unless you spend it immediately (which you can't do because virtually nowhere accepts it).

i'd imagine a couple of million have been lost up until the start of this year when people kinda couldn't afford to lose bitcoins because they started to become so valuable...
it's kind of sad / fascinating / scary that there are basically hundreds of millions of $$$ worth of bitcoin lost in cyberspace that anyone could claim if they had a few random digits and characters... 
if bitcoins ever reach 6 or 7 $ figures there's going to be *a lot* of people who'll look back and probably never get over the fact they could have been set for life... i know if it were me, i'd find it really difficult not to think about it every single day...

but the thing is in 4 years time you could be thanking yourself for investing in Bitcoin when you did, before it was too late...
we don't know how it will play out and i'll put it this way - it's nice to be worrying about how little profit you're making from an investment... i mean presumably you've got a between 5-10x return on your investment...
just think about the guys that banked on Apple stocks reaching $1000 and thought it was an easy and safe ride getting in at $700+... 
they've lost paper on paper and would chop both of their arms off for the kind of return you've got...
bottom line: if you're not losing money on investments, you're in a better situation than most... 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:25:42
i'm saying that if you *do* want to cashout within the next 12 months, it's probably not worth investing as personally i don't see Bitcoin reaching anywhere near it's potential in 12 months... there's also a risk it could go backwards before it goes upwards... this current boom only started about 2 months ago so we've no real idea of how it'll pan out, but so far so good...
if you have to ask why should you invest in bitcoin, then imo you don't know enough about it... for me, investing was a very clear decision... i had a lightbulb moment and said to myself "fucking hell, this thing can take over the world for xyz reasons"... 
if you're not of that mindset, then you're likely to stress out over the ups and downs and do something crazy i.e. get out for a loss when the price drops after an exchange goes down or gets hacked etc...

I think unlike bitcoin, litecoin is genuine speculation...
New people in to the market have a hard time wrapping their heads around bitcoin and naturally just assume bitcoin is going to have competition... litecoin is the next best thing at the minute so they buy some at low prices and hope it too reaches $800 some day...
although it's tempting, i'm staying out of litecoin because i'd only be in it for the wrong reasons i.e. to make a quick buck...

@_date: 2013-11-27 18:58:18
i think what Bitcoin needs is some stability.. i.e. 2 months of zero growth (in price)..
it's as if we've swam 50m flat out without taking a breath and people just expect we can do it every week / month...
if the focus is on price rather than use cases, the general public will begin to associate bitcoin with profit and that's a bad thing. 
sure, it may be profitable for anyone that invests but that's not why they should be investing... if people don't understand the technology and can't explain it to someone else, they shouldn't be investing at this stage in the game imo... unless they're stupidly rich... 
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:12:40
Rule no.1 in investing - only invest what you can afford to lose. Be prepared to lose everything. 
If you can afford to put your paycheck in to bitcoin and eat, sleep, pay off debt or whatever, then by all means do that. But don't be silly - all investment is risk and by definition that means there are no guarantees.
Bitcoin could stay at $800 for 12 months... it could drop to $500 and stay there for 12 months.. i'm not going to give examples of where it could rise to because i think we all know them :)
But *do not* invest unless you're going to stick around for the long haul... the market is volatile and if you want to cash out 3 months down the line expecting a 10% profit or something you could end up cashing out with a 30% loss...

@_date: 2013-11-29 13:57:04
The most important questions you need to ask are:
* do you want to cash out within the next 12 months?
* do you understand how bitcoin works?
Answer no to either or both and you're not ready to invest in Bitcoin. Personally, i understand the technology (i'm a developer) but I've also done a lot of research on Bitcoin and even set up [BTCvideos.com]( to archive all the videos I've watched (many of which changed my views on Bitcoin and got me interested).
I see Bitcoin as technology first and foremost and therefore i understand that it will die or succeed - there will be no middle ground. At worst, i think it will pave the way for a new type of currency that's regulated by someone like the IMF or some other 'neutral on paper' global political body. Because we know things move slowly in politics and banking, that won't happen for a long time, so i think Bitcoin will continue to rise in value because the technology behind it is revolutionary and highly disruptive in an industry which has seen virtually no change for the better in 10-15+ years... (since the introduction of eBanking which is nothing in comparison to Bitcoin).
So the appetite for change is there, i think most average people will understand the benefits, the technology just needs to mature and become idiot proof, which it will if there's an ever growing market cap and public interest.
But DO NOT take my word for it. Don't take anyone's word for it. Watch videos... read Satoshi's original paper, see what founders of big companies are saying about it and listen to the guys on wall street etc... then draw your own conclusions - you'll feel much more positive and in control at the end of it all... now, you still seem a little hesitant, which is perfectly fine and you're 100% right not to pump money in if there's any doubt in your mind at all Bitcoin is just a house of cards waiting to collapse. 
If that's your view you may absolutely be correct, you just gotta do your own research and convince yourself "yes, this is absolutely going to change the world" or "i'm still unsure, we might be in a bubble, i'll continue to wait and see how the next few months play out". Either decision is perfectly acceptable so long as it's based on your own knowledge.
