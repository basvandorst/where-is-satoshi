DEFINITION of 'SegWit (Segregated Witness)'
SegWit is the process by which the block size limit on a blockchain is increased by removing signature data from Bitcoin transactions. When certain parts of a transaction are removed, this frees up space or capacity to add more transactions to the chain.

Rather than layer “3” if you think about the upper layers that are on top of LN etc is where you move from the concept of individual transactions and move to streaming money.
There’s a great podcast between Andreas and Kevin rose where he talks about this concept.
An example being - imagine getting into a rental car and driving, you automatically pay a streaming amount to an insurance company literally by the second - and stop when you stop the car.
Or imagine a competitor to Apple Music / Netflix where you only pay as you actually stream - not some set monthly rate regardless of usage
These are the sort of things that can’t exist yet but can exist once the technology improves and further features are added to the network

I have BTC from back before the BCash fork. How do I safely ‘claim’ it? Is there a point to claiming it if I didn’t want to sell it? Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:11:14
Let say you are moving $100,000 - you just do a $100 transaction first with the same transaction details so they confirm everything transferred safely before you potentially fuck up and send the $100k to the wrong address or something

So thats what Im asking, how did you actually claim it using the trezor?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:43:47
This is why as crazy as all this is im not that worried. The barrier for entry is still gigantic for people if only from the mental standpoint of jumping in.
People like to think BTC is already mainstream but go talk to some normal people and they are terrified of it. The only people i have ever found are tech nerds and even most of those are being way more cautious around it than normal.
There is a lot of space here, but id still recommend selling enough to cover initial purchases for anyone that got in early

Right so after transferring to the Trezor it’s irrelevant, since it’s the original wallet where they need to be claimed.
But, they can still be claimed manually from that wallet and sent to the trezor afterwards

Do you realise how dumb it sounds to complain about it someone using “their code” when it’s open source? That’s the entire point
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:26:55
There’s a few ways to get rid of the fees:
1) Increase the block size so that more transactions can fit. 
In bitcoin the fee has no relevance or relation to the size of the transaction amount, only the amount of bytes the transaction takes. This can lead to some ridiculous fees if for some reason the transaction is large.
This is essentially the approach that bitcoin cash has taken with their hard fork. The issue here is that essentially
Bitcoin cash is just enabling cheap transactions until their pool of transactions also becomes to large - BUT - it’s good enough for now, which is a powerful thing in technology and often lets people select their preference so timing is important.
2) reduce the size of the transactions - essentially this is what you are doing when you have a Segwit address (starts with a 3 instead of a 1) 
The main pain with this is getting people to update their addresses when most users don’t understand them at all. 
Also getting the bitcoin INTO a segwit address still comes with the current high fees, which doesn’t help people with smaller holdings
3) build second layer solutions - like lightning network.
The idea here is that you think of the current bitcoin block chain as the ‘batch processing’ of the current banking world where only the huge collated transactions take place, all the minor (ie person to person) transactions sit on top of this like how http sits on top of tcp/ip.
For a scalable solution  makes the most sense BUT I  will take time to build, test etc. as obviously people will be wary of the new tech when their money is involved.
Who will “win” is anyone’s guess - personally I think lightning network is the best way to progress here. 
Coins like bitcoin cash have the advantage of if the bitcoin core gets lightning network working then they can also use that code. 
On the surface they seems to drastically downplay the effect of just increasing the block size but on the other hand when millions now have their bitcoin in wallets that have a smaller balance than the fee to transmit - which is really more useful?

Really the only difference is the security. The bitcoins aren’t stored in a device they are just not able to be transferred without the proper combination of keys.
Offline wallets store these keys offline so you can’t have them hacked somehow like you can online

There is major difference when you can buy such a late volume at a set price, generally if someone wanted to buy that many coins they would have to deal with the price inflating as they buy more.
This is a rare opportunity for someone to gather a huge volume for one price so they would presumably take into account a rise in price for this bid.
Alternatively whoever buys is going to be shelling out lots of cash which reduces the pool of possible buyers significantly

So as I am using the Bitcoin Core Wallet I should do the following:
1) waiting until after the fork
2) tranfer to a new bitcoin core wallet - this new wallet becomes my 'spv wallet'
3) transfer from this wallet to a bcc wallet if i want to also have money in bcc?
The bit that confuses is me is how to get the bcc into a usable state while not removing this from the original wallet? Do I open the wallet from point 2 in a BCC client and thats it?

Yeah that's always an option but in my opinion BTC is going up or down, CC interest is always going to be there, and often as high as 30% depending on the card. Something that's turning 5000% or more makes this a harder decision :)

Hi, this is a random place as ever for a far-future product suggestion but here goes.
What I'd like to do, is essentially:
1) See image of &lt;product&gt; on the web
2) Right-click image, select 'purchase &lt;product&gt;' (using bitcoin or other)
Thinking of a process such as this:
1) Find image, right click. The website shouldn't matter. 
2) Do some sort of google image search for the product
3) Use the results to find a possible description
4) Turns that into an amazon search
5) Finds the highest rated matching result
6) Shows a quick context window (ie, provided by a browser extension) to confirm the product looks correct and a price
7) Click purchase
8) Product Delivered as per my delivery preferences.
It seems like the perfect way to use a digital currency to make buying things online a whole world easier, and it seems like the type of idea where all the 'tools' are there, but not a seamless integration.

I would have to prioritize it on the following:
1) pay any high interest debt such as credit cards ( this is guaranteed interest on money you WILL lose )
2) ensure I have buffer cash for a few months expenses.
3) dump the rest into BTC.
This isn't really an option for me as I don't have a large dump of "fun money" to work with. BUT I'm happy putting monthly amounts of my spending fund into BTC as it's the money id otherwise spend on stuff like booze anyhow.
Everyone has different needs and never take investment advice from strangers on the net.

To add to this, a lot of the big crash around the $900 can be attributed to a guy that essentially had 1000 cows, and lets say a month ago made a decision that as soon as the price is $900 for a cow, I want to sell 25% of my cows for any price possible.
This could mean the people with smaller amounts of money are able to quickly grab a cow, and the price will tend to stabilise back where it was previously.

from the sidebar:
Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

They will NEVER approach the situation with "if we are the first to support this, we will have 100% market share".

Are bitcoins still able to be traded as a commodity but not currency?
What does "The public is free to participate in Internet transactions provided they take on the risk themselves, it said" even mean?
Are they saying people deciding to exchange goods and services for bitcoin is ok, but not exchanging it directly into currency?

Depending on your capabilities a good idea is to set a specific aside each month (eg $500) and consistently buy more BTC. If the price is down that month you get more for your money, if it's up then you're getting more value.
If you believe that the value of BTC will increase over time this is a winning bet.

In terms of deposits they have been quite good. I've made 2 separate cash deposits at an NAB branch, have had the payment verified within 15 mins, and then have had my Buy Orders for BTC processed immediately.
From clicking 'deposit' on their website to having my BTC in my secure wallets has taken less than 1 hour in both instances.

@_date: 2013-11-28 03:37:29
No idea, sorry. Also keep in mind that generally investment LOSSES are tax deductible, and that both of these apply when you actually receive the money from it.
Eg if you invest $100 and end the year on $110, you would be taxed only on the $10, and only if you actually retrieved your $110.
This is definitely not tax advice, I'm just assuming things here, realistically if you've made significant gains/losses talk to an accountant.
Handling currency investment could be extremely different to what I've done previously.
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:53:38
People can easily buy fractions of a coin so that the value increases and supply is reduced. No one would have to actually buy one bitcoin for $100k for the price of 1BTC to be that high.

Is there any capability within the bit coin protocol to flag addresses as "bad" and then have this fact propagate through the system?
It could allow transfers to be considered invalid if they originate from the address and so not be trusted by the network.
This may be impossible but I'm interested in this type of process and how it could impact bitcoin as a whole

You don't need to buy whole shares either btw. You can tell your agent that you want $500 of 'stock X' and you may end up with '43.23 shares'
