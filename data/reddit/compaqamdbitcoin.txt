It's not really so much of a _problem_ as it is a planned and proper use of intelligent economic planning by technical experts to incentivise adoption of LN and other second layer products and solutions _before_ making on-chain Bitcoin usage affordable  and competitive again. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:56:52


If they weren't happy with them they wouldn't pay them, or they would get their discount, (less than $7) with segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:52:16
This is gentlemen. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:15:53


It already has been [partially adopted](
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:10:35
Correct. It is already live on main net with torguard. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:03:40
We should wait until it segwit is available for use via the Core GUI. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:31:46
More clever to just HODL. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:59:43
They are controlling a latent portion of our hashrate at the moment, efforts towards lowering it could be seen as relevant.

I think the whining is more effective, honestly. Unfortunately it has to be, as there are tens of millions of users and a few thousand of us on a good day. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:32:49
We don't wish, the community made a _choice_. Anything else would be a hard fork, something the community will not tolerate as it would break immutability. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:37:47
There is a thing called whining on social media, we both know which is more effective.

New Paradigm. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:25:34


That remains to be seen. The base block may indeed remain in some form, with extension blocks soft forked on top of it, like segwit elegantly does.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:32:22
I prefer: The Bitcoin Project.

Whoops, there's your hard fork.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:42:03
You should adapt that understanding to the realization that it won't happen overnight, but with enough abstraction, the Core layer will be used very little indeed. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:13:10
correct, unless it is to fire the miners.

Doesn't surprise me that they censor "controversial" points of view, either. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:43:48
Partially doesn't == 8%, or 25%, it could be either, or in between. This is the benefit of using an opt-in soft fork, some may desire smaller blocks than you do, and that's OK.
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:46:54
Thanks for the moon report, seems legit. The typical 80% retracement seems highly implausible for round 4 as long as the tether train keeps a chuggin'.

Or the debug window, generate some segwit addys, send to them, off she goes.

The water is nice and warm, by no accident. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:12:08
Having to beg Coinbase and bc.i to implement segwit doesn't really bode well for our decentralised narrative, we should be a bit more quiet/focused regarding this issue. Perhaps long strings of replies on twitter would be more effective. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:03:56
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:37:18
Wrong. Those are a centralised scam coin, and a copy-paste scheme the founder used as a cum rag, respectively. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:26:46


False, they hate us 'cause they ain't us. People pay $10 for a BTC transaction because of the unmatched decentralised mining network. No shitcoin has that over pure BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:25:13
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:46:33
This is technically false. It could be any P2SH addy, not necessarily segwit compliant. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:53:41
It's like wearing a pin on your lapel. Positive messaging. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:37:23
Cute. Enjoy ur btrash gains. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:53:54


This is offensive. We are politely asking them to do what we want them to do, use segwit, and batch. They have become a portion of our decentralisation, and they should act accordingly, or not, and face a chorus of discontent on social media. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:50:01
Any moment now.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:10:24
You're better off just HODLing, then putting it into a lightening channel if you want to spend it.

@_date: 2018-01-13 06:45:15
Seeing as they have 8 figures of customers, each vote above 8000 counts, retweet on whaleclub, etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:30:12
BitGo and their consolidation transactions should be applauded for furthering Bitcoin's decentralised architecture.

Just buy. GDAX doesn't charge tx fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:34:33
To maintain Bitcoin's immutability? Yes.
Besides, the hashrate grows fast enough that a few dollars will move your BTC today. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:07:30
It might be a little awkward with a soft forking, but it's never as unnerving as the alternative, given an objective lack of broad consensus. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:05:24
Is there a configurable option to run current Core with all the improvements and bug fixes, without segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:33:51
The community has deemed them incompetent, watch as the community replaces them. Counter the proletariat at your own peril.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:04:47
Enemies of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:15:13
A hard fork means making a new coin and having everyone accept it, much cleaner to just roll it out as an optional feature that quietly and softly becomes standard. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:09:43
Why someone would shovel money to Jihan instead of using the Dragonmint miner is beyond comprehension.

@_date: 2018-01-04 03:06:29


Segwit is opt-in. That's one of its benefits. Besides, it allows for larger blocks which are known to cause centralisation in the fully-validating node network of peers. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:18:40
Jeez, no need to be mean. I saw them in an Adam Back tweet so I thought they might be real.
Jihan will be able to mine more thanks to you subsidizing his operation. I would rather just buy more coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:45:08
Ad hom all you want, friend. His entire operation depends on extracting value from you, and people like you. You forked it over directly, willingly, and were so giddy doing it that you felt the urge to get social acknowledgement of your massive mining op on reddit, enjoy.
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:27:23
It might be a little early to be so vocal about the downsides, but it's a decent article otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:01:26
Your use of 


is not helpful.
These are *Bitcoin* as long as your node is periodically monitoring the channel and broadcasts its refund tx to the main chain in case of automated fraud attempt.

Not before lightening strikes, which is this year.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:59:49
ETH? Basically less than zero, but at least it's not btrash. Monero has hard forked more times than most can name, but that pony guy is legit, can't argue with results. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:23:23
Everybody is watching the wrong chart. We need to concentrate our enthusiasm on [this]( one. 
It's opt in, so if people aren't using segwit, it's because they are voting with their money for smaller blocks. They are paying a premium to make the daemon more accessible to more people with lesser computers and connections, win-win. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:51:50
A hard fork breaks immutability in a way a soft fork never can, and as the base Bitcoin protocol was basically [set in stone]( from the outset, gentle/quiet soft forks are all we have in the toolbox. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:45:19
Interesting plan, but a series C? that might be pushing it. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:12:56
if they desire bigger blocks and lower fees they will use the CLI, it's not that difficult. Or they can wait a few weeks. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:34:05
Please. It broke Jihan's boostin', or at least made it acceptable, but visible and non-optimal. 
Veterans of the Fork Wars remember how he was lured into activating his demise and then humbled when we rejected the base block increase. This was the community's proudest moment, defeating the chinese mining cartel, for good.

Going to be posted daily until Lightening channels are in wide usage? OP's taken up a new hobby, perhaps he can whip up a bot to do the daily posting. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:08:03
I didn't say that I was offended. Just that the scenario you describe is offensive. Not using segwit is a choice, a choice to favor decentralisation by keeping validation requirements lower than they might have been. If there is an inefficiency, the market will solve it. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:42:38
Resolved!!! I have made myself heared.

AlexB, Blockstream [Futurist]( had it on his twitter for a very long time. Credit where credit's due. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:55:37


He does, the base block, non witness, remains 1MB indefinitely, immutable.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:57:02
So you're just taunting him? In reality, lightening will soon decrease on-chain demand to the point which his savings can be moved without giving it all to the miners. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:47:14

For Jihan? Hell yeah, it's okay. I bet he can't believe the rate at which his "competitors" throw money at him.

Correct. Billo.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:41:48
No. LN is the transactional layer. BTC is the "reserve" layer. Mining becomes decentralised 'cause math and lack of their price fixing latitude in the relatively near future.

It's not a problem of consensus. If users want to save on fees they can use segwit. More importantly, segwit enables the lightening network, which basically removes the need for this additional centralising capacity you seem to be asking for. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:34:16

Well there's your problem, bc.i is part of the malicious group that have not implemented segregated witness.
The fees right now encourage proper economic behaviour, as BTC is now mainly a store of value, censorship resistant wealth storage. Wait for LN if you want to make small payments like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:09:00
This is false. The real Bitcoin, ticker BTC, has never hard forked, this is its greatest strength, and triumph. Assuaging cheap numpties is not part of the rocketship to the moon plan.

@_date: 2017-12-22 04:38:28
Exactly, I'm breaking out the champaign. Watching the free market "encourage" users to move to segwit is truly a thing of beauty. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:36:06
Did I say BiCH? No, you did, shill.
LN is basically bitcoin transactions, with greater utility and privacy. Bitcoin simply doesn't scale, meaningfully, unless we deploy these systems first.

The economic majority supports segwit, we will use it as soon as bc.i and coinbase implement it.

What do you think they're doing?
For clarity… 500,000 transactions per day is a reasonable/conservative expectation of Bitcoin’s capacity including the new witness space. That could go higher with the implementation of Schnorr, MAST, and merge mined extension blocks. 
The main chain may very well end up dominated by car-sized and higher transactions that are perfectly willing to pay $10’s of dollars in fees. This is possible because LN is being engineered to scale dramatically and efficiently, without _global_ node resource costs. It will be able to handle all of the lesser day-to-day transactions, and they will be paying _dramatically_ lower fees than native Bitcoin tx, all without increasing the node cost burden for the operators of full economic nodes. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 01:27:25

@_date: 2016-11-27 20:22:34


Sorry to break it to you... but Bitcoin will not be having a hard fork.
Many of us deem a hard fork to break the sacred immutability of Bitcoin, and understand that once it was released, the design is basically set in stone, forever. A competing implementation would be a menace and expose users to loss of funds.
You see, the very idea of a hard fork is controversial, and we also know that:
"Controversial hard-forks [CANNOT]( happen."
So, they won't.
Thankfully, soft forks don't need full consensus to activate, just 95% of mined blocks. Segwit, Schnorr sigs, and MAST will all be soft forks. This allows the bulk of transactions to use the Lightening Network. There will be plenty of space for high value settlements to take place on-chain, while the full blockchain remains small and manageable for the network of fully validating peers that protect decentralization and censorship-resistance.
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:39:02

My question pertains not to diaphanous hypotheticals, but to practical reality. Is there a flag a pro-segwit miner may use to affect such an outcome? Or would this need to be coded up by an interested party? If the latter, circumstances dictate it should happen sooner than later.

The block size could be lowered to 0.75 MB without the contention of a chain-splitting HF, as a soft fork, just like the original imposition of the 1 MB limit. Old nodes would accept these blocks because they are below their own 1MB limit and the upgrade would be backwards compatible. 
This would increase decentralization and censorship resistance by lowering the burden we place on all fully validating peers on the network. This would have the side effect of lowering damaging utxo growth as well.
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:14:43


This is technically incorrect. The clams distribution was 4.6 per existing _address_ above a certain lower end value including ltc and doge addresses. 100 addresses with 1 BTC inherited 460 clams, vs one 100 BTC addy getting only 4.6.

@_date: 2016-11-27 03:01:01
So if I understand correctly: The miners agreed to Segwit (without a block size increase) and then a HF block increase 3 months later in a meeting with some Core developers? (Hong Kong Consensus)
Then, Core developers discovered a way to increase the block size with Segwit only (new compromise to 2.1MB), still as a SF, which makes the HF moot, but some miners are now angling to gain control of Bitcoin by demanding both? 
@_date: 2016-11-25 21:54:26


Many of us early adopters are firmly against _ever_ breaking the protocol with a hard fork. It would expose un-upgraded nodes to loss of funds. Therefore, and for many other reasons, they will _always_ be controversial. 
As we know:
Controversial hard-forks [CANNOT]( happen. 
So, they won’t. Soft forks do not require consensus as they do not break the old nodes of peers. Resultantly, they are the only option realistically available to us. If miners refuse the soft block size increase they have been offered in Segwit, we will simply work on things like fungibility. We are OK (many are quite pleased) with the status quo. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 23:51:36
Most miners are conspicuously _not_ voting for segwit so I thought I'd ask!
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:55:55
This was all already largely covered today in another post: 
And another thread:
tl;dr: Bitcoin will scale just fine given 1MB blocks. It will scale fine even without segwit. Any thought of a hard fork is too controversial to achieve consensus any time soon, maybe a year or three after people stop trying to force it politically. By then, it may not even be needed.

There are no 3rd parties in the Lightening Network, only peers, exchanging valid Bitcoin transactions. 
To take this to its logical conclusion: The LN **is Bitcoin**.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:01:05
When the only transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are opening and closing LN channels that perform thousands of tx per second… actual fees for a native Bitcoin transaction should rise to $10 to $20 each. It’s a very small price to pay to keep the blockchain manageable for all peers (full validating nodes) on the network, and thus, maintains our decentralization and censorship resistance.

The benefit of a soft-fork is that we can quietly bring them along with us, whether they consent to the changes, or not. They will be economically incentivized to move to segwit clients because segwit transactions will be significantly cheaper per byte.

Seems logical, miners ultimately make the call on which software to run and which blocks to build upon. The market rewards or punishes their decisions accordingly. This is a check on their power and a strong incentive to make decisions which maximize the value of the Bitcoin network and its token (their income).

Did the miners not _know_ this was coming tho? It seems that if you wanted the fork to be successful, you would come out strongly and quickly in favor of it, like BTCC did. 
6 months? The CSV soft fork took about a month and a half from 0 to activation if I’m reading the graph correctly. 
Isn’t avoiding the impression of 51% attack with the possibility of a resultant two chains one of/the main selling points for this type of fork? What am I missing here?

@_date: 2016-12-06 05:54:54
For an algorithm, guessing a correct fee without overpaying, is an impossible task. They only have knowledge of what has happened before their guess, and things can change _after_ they've made their guess, and before the next block is solved. 
If transactions are piling up, they tend to just continue to outbid each other. This leaves your tx in the unfortunate situation of being in queue, while everyone else jumps the queue to get ahead of you.

Sorry to break it to the renowned dice spammer turned altcoin peddler... but Bitcoin will not be having a hard fork, period. 
Many of us deem a hard fork to break the sacred immutability of Bitcoin, and understand that once it was released, the design is basically set in stone, forever. A competing implementation would be a **menace** and expose users to loss of funds.
You see, the very _idea_ of a hard fork is controversial, and we also know that:
"Controversial hard-forks [CANNOT]( happen."
So, they won't.
Thankfully, soft forks don't need full consensus to activate, just 95% of mined blocks. Segwit, Schnorr sigs, and MAST will all be soft forks. This allows the bulk of transactions to use the Lightening Network. There will be plenty of space for high value settlements to take place on-chain, while the full blockchain remains small and manageable for the network of fully validating peers that protect decentralization and censorship-resistance.

Better off buying GPUs. The time for firing the corrupt chinese miners is drawing nigh, don't give them any more money/coin.

Seems reasonable. 
Yet I doubt the clock will tick far as 2020 before the numpties get tired of blocking and stalling progress. Even if it did, it won't matter, as the lightening network will be live and handling the transaction demands just fine.

So hateful. That cesspool is disgusting.

Segwit signalling doesn't actually start until:
After 32 Blocks, About 4.8 hours
Slush jumped the gun a bit with custom software, thus the 1.4%.

Exactly. They want a blocksize increase? Activate segwit.
When they don't, the only explanation left is that they are attempting to stage a coup and secure control of Bitcoin. It's so obvious that the decentralized network of peers [doesn't]( want their bloat coin vision, but they keep trying and trying.

Say there are 1 million Bitcoin users. Your hard fork would be an attempt to _force_ 10,000 to 50,000 people to use an altcoin against their wishes. Bitcoin’s immutability is intended to protect minorities, at all cost, from the will of a majority.

“Near future?” ——&gt; No
There may be talk of something unspecific in the very far future, but that’s mainly to calm the wailing numpties. Everyone actually doing science knows better.

As long as it's a soft fork, no matter how dramatic, it's all good/  HF == scary/bad.

That hole in the wall sure was busy in December. Wasn't sure there was anyone left behind it, encouraging to know you're still at it.

Exactly right, BitFury is the miner of the people, they sell their machines to the public to help decentralize against the Bitmain monopoly. I'll take one _good_ mining company over a dozen bad ones. USAF or numpty!
