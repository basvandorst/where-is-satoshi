heh, it's funny actually, it seems that people are more worried about how I might be 'worried about downvotes' rather than the fact that I just wanted a fucking answer :)
You're cool though... I also like pie too so if I could upvote you twice, I would.

Yeah, as someone who doesn't use Twitter, I hate it when people refer to  tweets. If the company was professional, they'd put the announcement on their fucking website

Everyone was sure that the next Android OS version would be called Key Lime Pie and used that name a lot when reporting on what new features would be in the new version but then Google called it Kit Kat instead.
To me it's a chicken and egg scenario though. They very well could have planned on calling it Key Lime Pie but they either decided to fuck with everyone and change the name or they just saw a great marketing opportunity and ran with it.

How about you fuckers answer a simple question instead downvoting? I'm not that into the Bitcoin world as some of you so an explanation would nice.

You better brush up on those rules yourself 'cos 1|3 isn't the standard vote fuzzing, fella

I wasn't really hassling you, I was hassling the people you're talking about

If we're talking about Dwight then I'd agree. If we're talking about Jim though, that's a different story.

Thankyou for clearing that up. It's all an interesting topic
@_date: 2014-01-26 05:46:36
Yeah, good luck with that

Yeah, I was there a few years ago and was surprised at the amount of Asian chicks in Hong Kong. It was an eye opener.

Entire subreddit?? Obviously I was referring to the 3 people that downvoted me without answering the question.
Is generalising a thing you always do or did you just save it up for this occasion?

old coins? Could this have anything to do with the Government moving Silk Road's money from Ross Ulbricht's accounts?

Bro, do you even trailer park?

What I'm trying to explain to you is that you don't get fuzzed votes that quickly with such a small amount of votes either way. I don't care how you interpret the rediquette, I'm speaking from what I've seen over the years.
Your quote is semi-irrelevant because I was asking for an answer about the question I asked as opposed to simply complaining about downvotes. People should voice their opinions instead of simply downvoting without an explanation when a question is asked.
You can continue this crap if you've got the spare time but I've got better things to do.

What you're not understanding is that the question I asked can only answered by Ross.
Your interpretion of his defence, letter to the Judge and recent public statements only served to try to gain him a lesser sentence. What he really thinks (or thought) are a different story.

I don't use the drug markets or drugs at all but if I was getting an intoxicating substance from anyone I hadn't gotten it from before I'd test a small amount out first for purity before I did my usual dose. Not only because of the risk of OD but also because if the current stuff was way more effective then I'd know that I can use more hits per bag therefore decreasing the amount of money needed to get to my usual high.

There's an old saying "are you sorry because of what you did or are you sorry because you got caught?"

Which, is a bit ironic seeing as Craig Wright is as repulsive as a big sweaty vagina.
