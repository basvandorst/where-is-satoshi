Bitcoin takes the bitcoin from bitcoin, and shoots on bitcoin, near miss but hits the bitcoin, bitcoins recovers the bitcoin and passes it to bitcoin, gets checked by bitcoin oh and a fight has broken out between bitcoin and bitcoin. Bitcoin takes a hook from bitcoin, a jab, but bitcoin recovers and delivers hooks back to bitcoin, knocking bitcoin out, both bitcoins get sent to the bitcoin box for a bitcoin. We'll be right back, more to come after this short bitcoin.

No premed student knows anything about bitcoin let alone mining bitcoin. All they know is biology. They're don't know shit about computers either. Most can't even remove a virus. Most use Norton antivirus!!!

Lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:58
"Thanks for doing the bitcoin community solid"???
Not even proper English. You don't have to try and act cool. Just be humble. Just be yourself. Don't be a fuck boy. 
Nobody likes fuck boys.

Yes it's fucking horrible. The only anti virus you need is Malwarebytes premium. $25 per year. And it stops everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:04:04
It's a bad antivirus. It doesn't catch many things. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:00:01
Lmao.

So we're playing someone else's game
We are the pons and they control everything 
And they can tell the future 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:16:22
Lol why do you care. People made money and now want to secure profits while it's somewhat stable. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:24:12
They could easily go on the internet and read about btc but they chose to hire hookers, touch children and play blackjack instead 
They're stupid
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:51:55
