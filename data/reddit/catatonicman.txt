That's a valid argument for SegWit, since it's relatively recent (though one could also argue that SegWit has been operational on the testnet for a long time, and that Coinbase should have prepared it ahead of time).
Transaction batching, though, is something that they *always* could have done. Further, it's something they *should* have started working on way back when blocks started being consistently full. Every unbatched transaction they've done since then has been money down the drain.

@_date: 2016-04-22 16:27:21
Eh, kinda. Realistically, the most you'd see is a delay in centralization.
Decentralized GPU mining works because everyone already owns a GPU; the capital costs are zero for the casual miner. As long as mining revenue is above electricity/cooling costs, mining would be fairly spread out (assuming the mining pools don't get too fat).
Over time, though, mining would centralize in places where electricity and/or cooling is free/cheap, which would price out most people who don't have that luxury.
Further, even if the mining algorithm made ASICs impossible/impractical to create, high-efficiency mining-specific GPUs would be possible.

A LN channel is only open after the opening transaction is included in a block. Further security can be obtained by not using the channel until the opening transaction is a few blocks deep.
While the channel is open, the participants shuffle coins back and forth along the channel by signing and exchanging valid Bitcoin transactions that are not broadcast to the network. At any time, either participant can close the channel by broadcasting the most recent transaction to the network.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:35:26


Think of it in ideological terms rather than technical ones. BCH forked off in part because the users didn't want SegWit, so in that sense the upcoming activation of SegWit prompted a preemptive fork.

Different LN clients will probably handle an offline recipient differently. 
I'd expect the standard would be to notify the user that the target is offline, and let the user decide if they want to keep trying to send the transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:17:06


Well, they can *try* to do those things. It's unlikely anyone would use their new coin, though, so they'd probably not succeed.

Nothing happens, i.e., the transaction doesn't go through.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:24:47
Here's the answer as I understand it:


Yes, because LN transactions are 2-of-2 multisig. Both sender and receiver have to sign the transaction before it is valid.


Nothing in particular. The transaction won't do much until the recipient comes online, at which point the transaction can be received and properly signed.

Then host it yourself.


No idea what you're talking about here. The anti-theft watcher nodes are part of LN, and not a separate layer.


Payments are atomic, so there shouldn't be any consequences if a payment fails. In that case, the user can try again until the payment succeeds. 
Alternatively, they can establish a new LN channel directly with the target so they don't have to worry about routing issues. Or they can just send Bitcoin.
Of course, that's assuming that the simulation is accurate and that routing performance never improves. Not exactly something I'd want to bet on.


Not even close to true. I'm sure exchanges can benefit from sharing LN channels, but that's hardly the only use for them.

Not really, no. Remember that Bitcoin is, at the core, just a collectively-enforced set of rules. Any of those rules can be changed in a hard fork, including central tenets like the 21 million coin cap or the requirement that a private key is necessary to move coins.
Say we wanted to create a cryptocurrency that automatically recovered inactive or lost coins and returned them to circulation as part of the block reward. We could do the following:
1. Define an inactive address to be one that has no spends in, say, a year's worth of blocks.
2. Create a rule that allows miners to collect coins in inactive addresses as miner fees without needing to sign for them.
These rules would allow the miners to recycle old coins, but wouldn't allow them to just steal coins arbitrarily. Of course, users would need to refresh their coin timers occasionally to prevent them from going inactive and getting swept up by the miners.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:31:33
And people not using SegWit aren't paying more fees than they need to?
Also miners might end up making more in fees by constraining the supply. It would require that they all collude to make it happen, of course.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:35:39


You have that backwards.
BCH forked off before SegWit2x even had a chance of success or failure. Arguably the creation of BCH was one of the reasons why SegWit2x ended up dying, since the primary purpose of SegWit2x was a compromise to *avoid* having two different coins.


SegWit did increase functionality. In any case, just because something is quick and easy doesn't mean it's the best choice.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:52:45
I'm pretty sure a LN channel isn't open until the opening transaction has been mined in a block. I'd also assume there's some sort of "minimum security" provision that requires a certain number of confirmations before the channel can transact (and if not, there probably should be).
But let's say that the above isn't true. The critical thing you're forgetting is that CPFP exists. The closing transaction will act as a CPFP transaction to bump your malicious zero-fee opening transaction. 
But let's say that your closing transaction is *also* permanently zero because you're double malicious. In that case, the counterparty can issue a third CPFP transaction with a triple+ fee that will *guarantee* that all three transactions will get into the next block. Thus, your evil plans are naught but dust and ashes.
TL;DR: Your evil plans are bad and you should feel bad.

That's generally what's happening, yes. Could also be the miners mining their own transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:11:37
Look at it this way:
What if BCH came out with juicy 8 MB blocks, but the miners decided that mining anything more than 1 MB was a waste. Would you jump all over the devs and complain that they need to fix the block size issue? I'd hope not, because it's not the devs that are bottlenecking things.
The same applies to SegWit. The capacity is there, but people aren't using it. I have no idea why not; maybe they just like to complain.

The reason to keep the block size cap small is to keep node operation within the means of the average person so that the network won't become centralized. If the means increase, there's no reason not to increase the cap as well.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:26:13


First, LN nodes *require* Bitcoin nodes to check for fraud. They have to constantly monitor the mempool to ensure that the counterparty isn't trying to defraud the channel, and have to be ready to issue the counter-fraud transaction if that ever happens. Just because they're not constantly writing to the ledger doesn't mean they're independent of it.
Second, your argument would also apply to *any off-chain transfer of Bitcoin ownership.* Paper wallets as gifts? Not allowed. OpenDyme Bitcoin transfers? Absolutely haram. Off-chain exchanges? Verboten.
Third, as before, LN *requires* Bitcoin to work. It won't kill mining, nodes, or network validation. What it does is improve confidentiality, congestion, and fees by combining a bunch of transactions into a single ledger update.




LN doesn't replace Bitcoin, it sits on top of it. As always, users are still free to use Bitcoin directly without needing to deal with LN.

An argument can be made that it's impossible to have a hard fork and still remain the original coin. This is probably the "purest" view to take.
On the other hand, it's also arguable that if a hard fork resulted in the functional death of either resulting chains, then the remaining one would automatically get the original name. This case seems to be the only unambiguous outcome (as in, there's no other chain remaining to make a counter claim).
Another method would be via popularity, price, and/or difficulty. In the event of a hard fork, the chain with the most support (however that is measured) would keep the original name. That's how the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic and the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash/Bitcoin Gold forks worked. This is, I expect, how most forks will end up resolving.

Different security, not zero security. LN is just as secure as the underlying Bitcoin transaction with respect to third-party interference.
For channel participants, LN uses game theory rather than hashes to prevent theft. It's always possible for the counterparty to try to steal your coins (emphasis on the *try*), but they have to risk all of their own coins to make the attempt. 
Overall, LN security is higher than a plain old zero-conf transaction, but less than a fully confirmed transaction on the blockchain. That's a perfectly acceptable trade off for smaller transactions, and the channel can always be closed if additional security is needed.

As long as you verify that the address on the Trezor matches the original source address that you're trying to send to, you should be fine.

So you can take a phrase like, "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." and it would become:
Private Key: 5J72wgRQ7NE9TvDT7q4XbVM5vKvKQYjVJuaK472XNUgNww54uT6
Address: 1KJSEHVJmRNNgCATvBR3cNaJHosGYSGPwF
(Nobody should use this address, obviously.)
So as long as you remember the phrase you used, you can always recover any Bitcoins stored in that address. The downside? So can anyone else.
An enterprising person could find a list of common phrases like the one used here, precompute keys for different variations of all of them, and watch for any deposits. The moment anyone puts money into them, they can sweep the funds out. That's basically what happened to the OP.
A better example? Use the phrase "a" for a brainwallet. Just "a", lowercase, no frills. You'll get:
Private Key: 5KMWWy2d3Mjc8LojNoj8Lcz9B1aWu8bRofUgGwQk959Dw5h2iyw
Address: 1HUBHMij46Hae75JPdWjeZ5Q7KaL7EFRSD
If you look that up in a block explorer, you'll see that it has transactions. I've just "discovered" someone's brainwallet, and could steal their funds (if there were any funds there to steal).

Keeping multiple wallets secure is only slightly more effort than keeping one wallet secure. It's honestly a non-issue. Keep your eggs in more than one basket, and all that.
I will grant, however, that the current effort required to securely hold Bitcoin is probably above the abilities of a technological neophyte. It *is* something that needs to be worked on.

With shares, each person owns a *part* of the company. With Bitcoin, each person who has a copy of the private key effectively owns *the entire sum of bitcoins* at the associated address.
Any one of them could at any time take full control of all the coins by simply moving them to a wallet that only they have the key to. If they're careful, it wouldn't even be possible to know who actually took the coins; any of the people with access could have done it.

You don't need 95% miner support, technically. That's there to make extra sure that a malicious block won't cause a hard fork (and probably to act as a buffer in the event that some miners are false-flagging).
Theoretically, as long as the majority of miners are SegWit-aware, blocks with bad SegWit transactions will be rejected and any resulting forks will be invalidated by the longer SegWit chain.
The big problem occurs if SegWit only has a minority of the hash power, which could result in a hard fork of SegWit/non-SegWit chains, and the potential loss of all SegWit coins on the old chain.

It's actually not difficult to say why gold has value (historically speaking):
* It's fairly rare, but not too rare that it can't be used for commerce.
* It's difficult/expensive to get.
* It's difficult to effectively counterfeit (though not impossible). 
* It's generally non-reactive, so it doesn't corrode.
* It's easy to work with (low melting point, very malleable).
* It's dense ("feels expensive") and pretty.
Gold is one of the few materials that qualifies for all of these, which made it an ideal choice for a commercial standard. 
Of course, Bitcoin qualifies for most of these as well (and more).

Blocks are capped at 1 MB currently, so the blockchain can only grow so fast (1 MB per 10 minutes, roughly).
Plus, each transaction requires a transaction fee. Repeatedly sending spam transactions to yourself (or to another person) isn't free.
Currently, it would take around 1 BTC if you wanted to completely spam up a block. Over time, that's roughly $1k every ten minutes, or $144k for a day - and that's assuming that people don't just increase their fees, which many will.
Size-wise, it currently costs around $1M to add 1 GB of data to the blockchain.

People don't need a technical argument to reject something. A lot of folks hate SegWit because reasons (valid or not), and as long as they hold more than 5% of the hashpower, they can veto SegWit forever.

It happens - they're called orphan blocks. The one that is mined first generally wins out.
If two valid blocks are mined at the same time, they're effectively competing for inclusion into the block chain. 
Miners can choose which block they want to work from. The longest valid chain wins, so whoever manages to find the next block first will ultimately determine which of the two becomes part of the blockchain.
This is why it's recommended to wait for a few confirmations before assuming that a transaction is permanent.

If all the facts and reason are on one side of the debate, then there should be zero problem allowing the other side to flail itself into irrelevance. Banning things from discussion, however, gives the opposite impression.
Besides which, it was the implementation of said rules that created in the first place. IIRC they weren't breaking any rules until the mods decided to go full authoritarian.


It sounds nice and simple when you couch it in terms of penis pills in a Bitcoin subreddit - which is, presumably, why you decided to go that direction. Things wouldn't be nearly so clear if it were contentious penis pills in a penis pill subreddit.

The literal description of the rules has very little to do with how they're interpreted and implemented, and that's assuming the mods aren't doing anything on the sly.
Quite frankly, the mods have done very little to earn back the trust they lost when they decided that censorship was the best choice.
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:14:29
It's safe-ish and hardfork-resistant provided:
1. There are enough SegWit-aware nodes to propagate SegWit transactions.
2. SegWit-validating miners have more than 50% total hash rate.
If both are true, blocks with invalid SegWit transactions will (eventually) be orphaned by the longer SegWit chain.
If SegWit support is less than (or drops below) 50%, however, an invalid SegWit transaction would likely result in a hard fork that wouldn't reconcile automatically.
It's important to note that, in the event of such a fork, all SegWit coins on the non-SegWit chain would be up for grabs.

It could be. Depends on how practical and cheap the attacks are.
Changing algorithms is a solution of sorts, but it won't protect old addresses. Satoshi's coins, in particular, would be a juicy target.
This means we'll either have an influx of lost, old, and forgotten coins as the addresses are cracked, or we'll have to block spending (effectively destroying the coins) from insecure addresses. 
We could also kill old addresses only when they become valuable enough to try cracking.

@_date: 2017-02-27 16:55:10
If you had enough hash power you were willing to dedicate to the task, you could run a 51%+ attack on the chain. You couldn't really *destroy* it, but you could render it practically unusable.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:30:08
No, it's true regardless. It doesn't matter how many pro-SegWit nodes you have.
If you send a SegWit transaction now, it'll go through fine and someone will steal it.
If you try to enforce SegWit on that transaction, you'll create a hard fork wherein all SegWit-enforcing nodes are now on their own, incompatible chain that also happens to have zero hash power (or whatever hash power you can convince to mine on said chain).
That chain will (probably) wither and die before the difficulty can drop, poisoning the well for possible future deployments.
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:23:46


Correct, which is the source of the problem.


Except they can. What old nodes can't do is check if a SegWit transaction is valid (or, more accurately, they just assume that all SegWit transactions are valid).
If an old node mines a block with an invalid SegWit transaction, bad things happen. Other old nodes won't care, but SegWit nodes will reject the block as invalid and refuse to build off it. Thus, a hard fork.
At this point, the bad block isn't really a problem - it's basically an orphaned block. As long as the SegWit fork has more hash power, it will grow faster than the non-SegWit fork, and the old nodes will switch back to it once it has accumulated more work.
If the SegWit fork doesn't have more hash power, the gap between the two forks will grow over time and make reconciliation both more difficult and more costly.

Not really. Transactions are not archived in any way, they're just kept in the Bitcoin client memory until they time out or are included in a block. If they time out, the coins are not sent and the transaction fails.
Transactions are only permanent if they're confirmed in a block that isn't orphaned or invalidated.
When an amount of bitcoin is sent, it is (generally) split up into three parts:
* Coins sent to the target address (the amount you're sending).
* Coins sent to the change address (the change you get back, usually to a new address).
* Coins sent to the block reward address (the difference between the other two).
They are all part of the transaction, and all happen immediately when the transaction confirms.
With Child Pays for Parent, the parent is an unconfirmed transaction that you want to confirm. It's not in a block yet.
The child is a new transaction with a (relatively) high fee that is likely to be put into a block. IIRC it is constructed using the change from the parent such that the parent must be included with the child to make the child valid.
Miners who want the high fee of the child must also include the parent in the same block, which compensates for the low fee in the parent.

You seem to forget that miners also run nodes, and that each node can decide independently what blocks it considers valid. A block rejected by 99% of the network can still be accepted by the remaining 1% ( which causes a fork, of course).
If the miners decided to go one way and the non-miners decided to go another, the miners would win because they have the hash power. Unless you have a way to prevent miners from talking with each other - and running a bunch of nodes doesn't do that - you won't be able to force the miners to do anything.
SegWit at the very least *requires* a majority of miners.

It is possible for older nodes to legitimately validate transactions and blocks that are invalid on newer nodes. Is this not considered to be a break in the ability to transact?
@_date: 2017-02-02 13:50:21
Transactions that don't get confirmed in the current block are kept in the mempool until they make it into a future block or until three days pass. 
A forgotten transaction can be resent without issue. There are also techniques to fix stuck transactions - Child Pays for Parent, for example, where you create a new transaction with a higher fee that depends on a stuck transaction. Miners have to include both if they want to mine the child.

Yes and no.
An old node won't normally include SegWit transactions in a block because they're non-standard, but nothing is stopping someone from manually including one.


SegWit nodes are the only ones that can tell if a SegWit transaction is valid. Old nodes see all SegWit transactions as valid by default.
As such, an invalid SegWit transaction included in a block would be valid to all old nodes, but invalid to all SegWit nodes, resulting in a hard fork.


No. Just....no. The only way to be sure a block is valid is to verify it yourself. Assuming other miners will hand you valid blocks is a terrible idea.


Miners care a hell of a lot about the previous block, because the previous block lets them know what transactions have been removed from the mempool.

If enough miners got together on it (and had enough programming acumen to make a client with the changes), they they could indeed alter the supply. Nobody would be forced to use their branch, of course, but it might be too difficult to mine on the original.
No *single* miner can do much of anything, because no single miner has enough hashpower to dictate policy. Enough miners together, however, can do just about anything they want.
There are disincentives to being malicious, of course, so it's unlikely that the miners would intentionally do anything to hurt the price.

Why, exactly, do you think that keeping channels open indefinitely is a problem?
@_date: 2016-03-04 14:30:58
That's simply not true.
If the network can handle 3 TX/s, say, and it is given 3.1 TX/s, *someone* is going to be kicked out. It doesn't matter if the fee is $0.10 or $1.00 or even $100, because there are simply more transactions available than the network can handle.
"Luckily" higher fees reduce the number of transactions that are economically viable, so it will eventually level out - but only after it prices out transactions below some value.

SegWit is an "upgrade if you feel like it" scenario. A hard fork, on the other hand, is an "upgrade if you want to keep making money" scenario. 
Of the two, I expect a hard-fork switch would be much faster. Because, you know, money.

It *is* a given, unless you want to risk a hard fork. Worse, in such a scenario, SegWit will have the minority of the hash power. Sounds like a good way to ensure that SegWit fails in the worst way possible.


No, because miners can entirely ignore UASF and suffer no real penalty. They can do that because it's both opt-in and a soft fork.
If you can get enough fees locked behind the SegWit wall, you might be able to get the recalcitrant miners to start caring.


Nothing is exactly what they could do. How valuable will SegWit transactions be if nobody bothers to mine them? At the moment, the block reward is still king; miners could weather a significant drop in the fee reward and still be laughing. 
Regardless, the issue isn't about economics. It's not about SegWit. It's not about evil miners, or user control, or the price of tea in China. 
No, the issue is that **UASF has a gaping security flaw** that's only mitigated **by having the majority of the hash rate.**
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:34:36
That seems a rather contrived situation. Realistically, how would BU get 100 blocks higher than Core if core has 1.5 times the hash rate?
In any case, it doesn't really matter. Once they fork, they're functionally separate coins. Coinbase could simply support both.

Technically that remains to be seen.
There are two big factors to consider: the fee per transaction, and the number of transactions. The balance between the two will determine if miners gain or lose (or stay neutral) from a fee market.

Miners decide what software they run, which controls the rules that define what makes blocks and transactions valid. The miners also choose what transactions, if any, get the privilege of going into a block.


Nobody holds "ultimate power"; everyone is interdependent.

If less than 50% of the total hash rate is SegWit-aware, a single block could create a lasting hard-fork (assuming manual intervention isn't taken).
How much hash power is required really depends on how quickly the attacker wants the fork to happen. Given around 144 blocks/day:
* A day? Around 0.7% of the total hash power.
* A week? Around 0.1% of the total hash power.
* A month? Around 0.023% of the total hash power.
* A year? Around 0.0019% of the total hash power.
Add to that whatever hash rate is necessary to drop the SegWit total below 50%, and you'll get a decent estimate.

They're backwards compatible except when they aren't, and they most definitely produce two protocols. 
Due to the nature of soft forks - a tightening of the rules - there's always something that's valid to old nodes but invalid to new ones, and that something can cause a hard fork. 
They don't produce two chains only because new nodes strangle out the older rules. The old rules still exist, though, and are still valid for the old nodes.
Also, they *could* produce two names; it's only by convention that they don't.

What caused the flip? Did a big new miner appear on the scene? Did an old miner suddenly switch sides? Did someone find a huge flaw in BU? Did Core implement a new wonder upgrade that BU can't handle? Is it some sort of contrived pump-and-dump scheme?
Details are relevant.

A Sybil attack. If an attacker has control of (or is able to get information from) enough nodes on a route, they can potentially reconstruct the payment start and end points.

The blocks aren't invalid for non-UASF nodes, which is why it would cause a fork. Being opt-in doesn't really help, since the transaction that breaks UASF would be, by definition, not a SegWit transaction.


A reasonable stance, assuming someone wasn't, say, an attacker who couldn't care less about the will of the community.

LN and sidechains are certainly different, but those differences are mostly irrelevant to Bitcoin proper.
Sidechains can function similarly to LN - one transaction to move coin to the sidechain, and one transaction to move coin back. They don't necessarily need to have arbitrary coin-swapping, though that can be a useful feature.
And, while they do keep transaction history, they don't need to guarantee the same level of permanency as the main blockchain. A sidechain can be safely deleted once its coin is moved back to the main blockchain.
From what I understand, LN is a point-to-point system - each channel can only connect two endpoints. This means that each pair of entities who wish to transact must have an independant LN channel, or they must go through a third party (or parties) who can middleman the transaction.
Sidechains, while being more costly in terms of security and storage, allow for the same transaction framework as Bitcoin itself, and don't require a trustworthy middleman.
If Bitcoin survives long enough, I suspect we'll see both systems being used.

Worst case, a hard-forked version would be identical to the soft-forked version. Core could do substantially better than the worst case, though, if they went with a hard fork.

Remember that since there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin, and since each coin is only divisible to 8 decimal places, there can only be at most 2.1e15 or ~2^51 addresses in use at any given time.
Considering that there are 2^160 addresses available, each bit of dust has around 2^109 addresses to hide in.

You've already paid, technically, but you can always choose to pay more; 
the government will be perfectly happy to accept more money from you if you want to give it.
What you can't choose to do is *not* to pay for services that you *don't* use.


Being able to choose who gets the privilege of robbing you isn't exactly much consolation. Plus, it's not like relocating is free; being allowed to relocate doesn't mean you have the capability.
Plus, you can't legally leave the country or move into another country without permission, so....

Actually, the supply does shrink (albeit slowly). Coins stuck in addresses with lost private keys are essentially inaccessible. Further, dust transactions may never be economically viable to spend. These coins aren't lost, but they might as well be.

@_date: 2017-08-10 22:27:17
Nice copypasta. You're still wrong, though.
The amount of Bitcoin in a channel is fixed. You can move it back and forth as much as you want if the channel is bidirectional (the aforementioned rebalancing), but you can't add or remove Bitcoin from the channel while it's open.
The concrete example is thus: A LN channel with 1 Bitcoin can never send or receive more than 1 Bitcoin. Rebalancing could allow that 1 Bitcoin to go back and forth, but the channel would never be able to pay for something that costs 1.1 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:08:24
That's nice.
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:27:45
Both you and the counterparty would lose 0.5 satoshi (due to the rounding), which would combine to form 1 satoshi that would be given to the miner as a mining reward. No Bitcoin would be lost.

That's rather the point of a second layer solution, yes? You *should* be using it more than the base layer. 
The capital isn't really tied up, either, considering that you can spend it at will. It's also only a single transaction away from unlocking if you absolutely needed it on-chain.
Whether or not LN will actually scale well is a different matter. Nobody will know that until it's tried in the wild. It will almost certainly require bigger blocks eventually, though.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:43:02
Holding onto mined blocks is risky; there's a chance someone will release a different block first, orphaning the held one.

@_date: 2017-08-19 14:28:37
It's perfectly fine math. Deal with it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:18:06
It works like this: 
* A SegWit block can be, at most, 4 million weight units. 
* Each byte of witness data counts as 1 weight unit.
* Each byte of non-witness data counts as 4 weight units.
* Fees are now paid per weight unit rather than per byte.
Thus, you get an effective fee discount of 75% on witness data. Witness data makes up around half of a normal transaction, so you should expect to see around a 40% fee reduction with SegWit vs. a normal transaction.
There's also likely to be a general reduction in fees due to a higher throughput, but that's hard to predict with any certainty.
Edit: Corrected some math.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:44:00


The problem with arguments like these is that they're transient. BCC may be more profitable....until the difficulty adjusts, reversing the equation. 
There's also fees to consider. Unless BCH has full blocks to drive up fees (or very generous users), it will never generate as much fee revenue as BTC - and yes, that's even taking a 4x to 8x transaction volume into account. 
Low fees are supposed to be a feature of BCH anyway, so I doubt it'll ever be fee competitive.


It certainly will, but he jury is still out on what that truth will ultimately be.

They're under a single master seed, which isn't an address. Passphrase-protected wallets have additional security on top of that.


Impossible? Probably not. Then again, neither is someone generating the exact same master seed or private key. "Impossible" is an impossible standard.


Thus the use of the passphrase-protected wallets. Each passphrase generates an entirely different wallet, and the passphrases are not stored on the device.
Comparatively, the only "open" wallet is the default one that has no passphrase. If someone could somehow figure out a way to bypass all the security features, the only wallet they're guaranteed to have access to is the default one.

Sounds like semantics. Fees in the second layer can be considered to have moved off-chain on the assumption that they would have occurred on-chain had there been room.
That's a bit simplistic, of course - it ignores average fee increases due to fee pressure, and use cases that are specific to the second layer.

Yes he is. The sun and the earth both orbit the barycenter of the solar system.
But that's irrelevant, since the geocentric theory is a hell of a lot more involved than just the sun and the earth and their relative motion.


Not in the slightest. There are pros and cons to both large and small block sizes. The argument has always been about the balance point between the different variables.
In any case, I could certainly buy that he was being facetious, but I'm not seeing any hidden messages or insight. If he was trying to make some sort of analogy between the block size and the solar system....well, he failed. Badly.
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:40:40
Alrighty then. From the beginning:
Bitcoin is, fundamentally, a long chain of blocks cryptographically strung together. The genesis block was the first, and the most recent block mined is the last.
In order to prove that the chain is valid, Bitcoin nodes must walk the entire chain from the genesis block forwards and verify the cryptographic proof of every transaction and every block.
Once a client has verified a given block, it no longer needs the block data to operate. It can choose to keep the data (archival nodes), or it can discard it (pruning nodes).
Archival nodes contain the full blockchain - from the genesis block all the way to the top. They're responsible for providing the complete block history to other nodes that are still verifying the blockchain. *If there were no archival nodes, new nodes wouldn't be able to get the full blockchain. They would never validate, and would be non-functional.*
Pruning nodes function the same as archival nodes, but they don't contain the full blockchain. They're a convenience feature that allows users to run nodes without needing 100+GB of storage for all the blockchain data. Critically, *they cannot seed new nodes with old blocks.*
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:20:52

@_date: 2017-08-19 05:57:12
The main problem is that, without congestion/fee pressure, there's no reason for users to pay any more than the bare minimum. 
BTC has that fee pressure, but BCH does not. BCH is arguably worse off in this sense, because low fees is one of its main selling points.
So let's look at the [median fees as they stand now.]( The BTC fees jump around, but let's take the lowest recent value - $0.7 per transaction. The BCH fees hold pretty steady at around $0.07 per transaction, a 10x difference.
Given that difference, BCH would need 10x as many transactions to net the same fees as BTC - which it can't, since its block size is only 8x as large.
Now consider that the current median BTC fee is much higher than $0.7, and you'll see why I doubt that BCH will be able to compete on fees.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:18:36
If it's an attack, it's a social one - of the "look how clogged the mempool is guys; clearly we need bigger blocks to handle it" type.
It's also possible its people trying to consolidate coins on the cheap, reducing UTXO bloat so that future transactions will have lower fees.
If SegWit was active, I wouldn't be surprised to see a bunch of low-fee transactions as people start preemptively moving coins to SegWit addresses.

Since miners are currently mining BCH at a very fast rate, the block reward won't last. As the block reward goes away, the incentive to mine BCH also goes away as it has virtually no fees to support it.

Except, due to the limits on transaction throughput, switching addresses is going to be very slow and/or very expensive. This is doubly true if users want to preserve their anonymity rather than just dumping all their coins into a single address.
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:44:46
No, every *address* has that many keys.
Each public key maps to one private key, and *vice versa*. Each public key also hashes to a single address, but the address space is smaller than the key space (160-bit vs. 256-bit), so keys have to share addresses.
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:18:39

You really don't need to worry about a keylogger, since the Trezor hides seed word order on restore.

"Can I top off LN channels?" -&gt; Yes, but there's no difference between topping them off and making a new channel.
"Can I add Bitcoin to a LN channel without making another Bitcoin transaction?" -&gt; No, because that would be completely insecure and rife with fraud.

With that much hashpower, it would be more profitable to just mine Bitcoin directly than to waste time trying to crack a Trezor.

Your conclusion does not follow from your evidence. All the SegWit percentage indicates is that the potential fee savings aren't sufficient motivation to expend the effort to move coins to SegWit addresses.
If, hypothetically speaking, there was a hard fork looming in the future that would *destroy* all non\-SegWit coins, you can be damn sure that everyone would be using SegWit as soon as they could get their transaction through.

Except that rock bottom fees are a great time to move coins over to SegWit addresses in order to achieve future savings. It comes down to the same thing: the current and future savings provided by SegWit aren't seen as enough to bother switching over.

Part of the contract of Bitcoin is the immutable history. This enables people to store data on the blockchain in a permanent and censorship-resistant form. There are lots of uses for this capability, but they all rely on the fact that Bitcoin won't arbitrarily forget pieces of that history.
We *can* discard old blocks, but we'd be breaking that contract if we do. It's not something to resort to unless it's an *absolute* necessity.
In my view, it's in the same category as a PoW change or address/coin invalidation.

A 12 word seed has around 479001600 permutations (10^8.7).
A 24 word seed has around 620448401733239439360000 permutations (10^23.8).

With cash, your money is spatially locked. You can't spend cash long distances without going there in person or trusting another person to take it there for you.
Miners can also refuse to include transactions. They generally don't because it's profitable to include them. Even if they did, another miner could pick up the spare. Why would you assume LN is any different?

There are a few options that will work.
1. Buy specialty Bitcoin mining hardware (as others have mentioned).

That's the thing, though: the BCH argument isn't wrong. High fees and low throughput is a problem that needs to be solved.

Well, either that or a bunch of people have transactions that they don't particularly care about.

Hard drive size is probably the least important issue.
Bandwidth is the big one. Anyone with a bandwidth cap will likely lose the ability to run a node, which hurts the network.
Small miners are disadvantaged by larger blocks, which would cause more mining centralization.
Convincing enough people to make a 64MB fork sustainable is probably impossible at the moment.
Blocks that aren't full have essentially zero fees, which is only sustainable as long as the block reward holds out. It's not a long-term solution.

Technically true, but you're missing the fact that those transactions can be reversed for at least a month or three. You can't guarantee that the money won't be removed from your account until that window has passed.
With Bitcoin, the situation is similar: you can't guarantee a TX won't be dropped/double spent until it has been mined in a block, and you can't guarantee that the block won't be orphaned until it's a few blocks down. 
Given that, a TX that takes a day to solidly confirm is still months better than legacy payment processors.

Depends on what outcome you believe to be the most likely. It might be profitable to keep both up to effectively double your coins.
It's possible that raising the value of one chain could lower the value of the other, making the net gain zero.

We can get rid of coins easily - just send them to a burn address.
As to the number of coins, it really doesn't matter since the coins are readily divisible. There are also ways to increase divisibility - directly or indirectly - if it ever becomes necessary.
As to growth, the sentiment is, generally, that deflationary currencies will stagnate because nobody will invest them. The solution would be to set higher interest rates to take into account the natural interest built into the currency.

They really don't, no. 
The only way to increase fees is to spam transactions just below the fee level they want to force. This cost increases as the fee pump increases, and that doesn't include the 50%+ losses to other miners.

Cash is fungible - in fact, it's one of the primary examples of fungibility. Yet, it would be possible to create rules that segregate cash based on its attributes - serial number, markings, age, newness, etc.
It's possible, therefore, to turn cash from fungible to non-fungible. Critically, since people don't care about any of those attributes, they don't impact the fungibility.

Nobody invested in Bitcoin would use such a chain, since their holdings would be devalued. 
Miners have some incentive to increase the supply since they'll be the ones to reap the immediate reward. Doing so, however, will cause a rapid market crash, and, over time, will further devalue their Bitcoin holdings. It's not a practical thing to do unless the miners have no Bitcoin holdings, and can immediately dump the coin for a less-inflationary currency/commodity.
In other words, the only people who would want to increase the supply are those who have no stake in Bitcoin. It would be a 51%+ attack, basically.

Fungibility does not require non-traceability. Traceability can *affect* fungibility, but doesn't necessarily do so.

There's no concrete answer, because SegWit transactions don't really have a maximum size other than the 4 MB block weight limit. As such, the block size will vary depending on the nature of the transactions it holds.
A basic SegWit transaction (1 input / 1 output) has a transaction size of around 218 bytes, corresponding to a transaction weight of 542 weight units.
Using only this kind of transaction, we could make a block with ~7380 transactions, which would have a block size of ~1.6 MB. Consider that a rough lower bound for an all-SegWit block.
As the transactions get more complicated (more inputs/outputs and scripts), the proportion that is witness data will go up and the block size will increase.
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:47:51
It does answer the question you asked, though maybe not the question you intended to ask.
The size parameter (Witness Size + Non-Witness Size) is the one actually placed on the disk. So, for example, a full block with zero witness data would have a block weight of 4 MB but a block size (what's actually written to the disk disk) of 1 MB.

That's one of the two I mentioned, and the one that didn't result in a fork.
The other was a chain split in 2013 due to an incorrect database configuration, which did result in a split and required a reorg to reject the large block that was causing the problem.

The math here is only approximate. SegWit transactions should actually be slightly larger (less efficient) than non-SegWit ones.


Two main reasons:
1. SegWit provided a malleability fix, which is something a basic block size increase wouldn't.
2. SegWit didn't need a hard fork, which is something a basic block size increase would require.

A full block of *only* witness data can't happen, but if we pretend that it could we'd end up with a block size of 4 MB.

For LN, the number of transactions is irrelevant (LN doesn't store channel history). An LN closing transaction should end up smaller than a standard legacy transaction. A rough comparison:

As such, if you can afford to send two SegWit transactions, you can afford to close a LN channel.

Models are fine, but they're only as valid as their ability to predict outcomes. The existence of mathematical formulas that produce objective metrics doesn't mean that those metrics map to reality in any meaningful way. 
Further compounding this problem is that the people creating and using those metrics are themselves part of the system that they're trying to predict. This can cause self-fulfilling prophecies where, even if otherwise meaningless, the very belief in a particular metric or indicator can cause that prediction to come true (e.g., a strong sell indicator causes traders to sell on the assumption that the price will drop).

Not quite. Transactions using older coins will be broadcast on both chains, so you have to be careful not to accidentally spend coins on the other chain. There are ways of splitting the coins, though, so its a fixable problem.

You should take your own advice. Claiming to be an expert isn't compelling evidence of anything. Telling people to "read the source" would be useful if you actually linked to the pertinent parts that support your argument.


Centralized hubs will almost always be more efficient than numerous smaller hubs - this is the economy of scale. LN, like Bitcoin itself, is affected by it. 
Unless you have a solution that isn't affected by economies of scale, your argument is useless.


This does not follow; the two issues are orthogonal.

There's actually a few ways where it could come into play.
One case where it may matter is when initializing hardware wallets using a computer to input the keywords. A keylogger on the host system would collect all the words, but in a random order. To be fair, though, it's less relevant now with direct entry into the hardware wallet and/or dummy words to pad out a 12 word phrase.
Another case would be storing the seed words in a different order (best as a valid order for plausible deniability and/or a wallet canary), and then storing the actual order in a separate location. An attacker would need both the order and the words to get to the hidden wallet, while the obvious wallet would only serve to alert the user that they were compromised.
Another case would be splitting the 24 word seed into two valid 12 word seeds. Similar concept to the above, but with an added layer or two of obfuscation.

Correct. An old node would consider any transaction from a SegWit address as valid, even if the rest of the network disagreed.

It's not really an attack, per se. 
Any time the blocks are full, it's possible for someone to spam the mempool with low-fee junk transactions that will never confirm. It doesn't do anything other than make the network appear more congested than it is (and force out transactions that are even less likely to confirm, I guess).
I can't confirm that this is happening, of course. It's possible that this is all legit.
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:12:29
The point is that a spammer isn't going to put a fee in that they expect to confirm - like 400 sat/byte.
Right now, fees less than 150 sat/byte aren't guaranteed to confirm. A spammer could throw in as many transactions as they please with, say, 90 sat/byte fees and be reasonably confident that very few, if any, of them will manage to get into a block.
For those transactions, the fee might as well be zero for all it matters.

Anyone can create a hard fork at any time. Now there's an extra incentive to do so.
The problem is that there's only incentive there for one miner. If miner X gets the reward, miner Y won't have any reason to continue mining on that fork.
Miner X would need to create a similar reward for miner Y to keep them on the chain. They'll have to repeat this until they can entice a majority of the hash rate away from the old chain, all while avoiding reorgs and rejection from old nodes.
Even then, there would still be two chains.

@_date: 2017-05-23 16:05:15
It can (nearly) double capacity *eventually*, but it's not immediate in the way a direct block size increase would be. Funds need to be spent to SegWit addresses before any efficiency gains could be achieved.
There's also the lock-in time, which would delay things a couple weeks even if all the nodes immediately jumped to SegWit.

[Investopedia]( has a list of common traits that Ponzi schemes tend to have:
1. A guaranteed promise of high returns with little risk
2. Consistent flow of returns regardless of market conditions
3. Investments that have not been registered with the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](
4. Investment strategies that are secret or described as too complex to explain
5. Clients not allowed to view official paperwork for their investment
6. Clients facing difficulties removing their money
Looking at Bitcoin we can go down the list:
1. False. Bitcoin makes no guarantees of returns, or even long term stability.
2. False. Bitcoin gains/losses are directly tied to the market price. Buy low sell high is the only way to profit here.
3. True. Bitcoin isn't registered with the SEC. Or anybody. That's rather the point, really.
4. False. Nothing secret or special here: sell at the right time and you win; don't sell at the right time and you lose.
5. False (as long as your holdings are on-chain, at least). Bitcoin is incredibly transparent; the "official paperwork" is available (encouraged, really) for everyone to view and audit.
6. Mostly false. TXs can be slow to confirm when the network is congested, but other than that they're really easy to trade away for goods and services. The biggest hurdles to selling them are the other people you're trying to sell them to, not the ability to transfer them.

Depends on how you look at it. 
SegWit changes nothing on the block level (to maintain backwards compatibility). Everything important is in the transactions and the associated witness block.
That said, SegWit blocks can't fully validate without the witnesses, so they're functionally a part of the block even though there's some conceptual separation between the two.
Given that, I'd argue that any block that requires segregated witness data to fully validate is a SegWit block.

SegWit *is* the new software.
SegWit has a vulnerability under which a miner can mine an invalid SegWit transaction which will be rejected by SegWit clients but not by non-SegWit clients, resulting in a hard fork. When SegWit miners are in the majority, it's not a problem; the invalid block will eventually get tossed by a chain re-org. If SegWit hashpower ever becomes the minority, however, the chain split will persist.
UASF is fine as long as it maintains over half the hash power; it's dangerous to use with anything less.

I think a bigger cap would be better, but I don't think it will directly translate into market cap.
A cap will push the fees up, which will price out the lower-value transactions. As long as the fees don't get *too* high, the extra value lost at the lower end is negligible.
Cheap transactions will either stop, or, more likely, will move off-chain to places like Coinbase (or LN whenever that starts to exist).

Say I had a pie, and I wanted to share it with some friends. To do that, I decide to divide the pie up so everyone can get some. So with 10 people, each person gets a tenth of the pie; with 100 people a hundredth, etc.
    1 pie / 10 people = 0.1 pies/person
    1 pie / 100 people = 0.01 pies/person
    1 pie / 1000 people = 0.001 pies/person
Let's say I'm so popular that I have an infinite number of friends, so I have to slice the pie up into an infinite number of slices. Each slice ends up being infinitely small, so we'll call them zero.
    1 pie / inf people = 0 pies/person
Now that's not much pie per person, but adding more pies doesn't really help us because any finite number of pies will be obliterated by my infinite friends.
    10 pies / inf people = 0 pies/person
    100 pies / inf people = 0 pies/person
    1000 pies / inf people = 0 pies/person
Now here's a question: if every person in our infinitely large group gets zero parts of pie, how many pies did we start with?
    inf people * 0 pies/person = ? pies
Is it 1? 10? 100? 1000? Is it zero? Turns out it could be any of them; they all satisfy the equation. That's why (0 \* inf) is considered indeterminate; there's an infinite number of answers that satisfy it.

This is the kind of statement that's technically correct but practically useless.
It's true that there's always a fee that will get a TX included in the next block, but that fee could potentially be more than the TX itself. As such, there's a functional cap on fees before TXs get priced out.
It's also true that Bitcoin has a cap on the maximum throughput, and that no amount of fees will get more TXs confirmed than that limit allows. If more TXs are sent than the network can handle, there *will* be TXs that have to wait for confirmation (congestion).
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:53:49
It won't help immediately, no. As people start using SegWit-style transactions, though, it will reduce the backlog.

Not really, no. Even if people are very conservative with their LN channels and open/close them sparingly, there's simply not enough throughput to handle the projected load required for widespread adoption.
SegWit and LN, assuming it's adopted relatively quickly, would solve capacity issues short term, but at the end of the day there's only so much that can be done with, say, 10 transactions/second. For example:
10 TX/s * 31,622,400 s/year = 316,224,000 TX/year
Assuming a person is allowed a single LN channel opening/closing per year, Bitcoin + SegWit could support around 158 million LN channels. That's half the population of the US. You can pare down that number with further assumptions, of course, but the problem should be obvious.
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:17:51
Not exactly. LN can work with any sufficiently connected graph. The resulting topology depends entirely on how people use it.

That's closer to Schnorr signature aggregation, not SegWit, though I think the latter is required for the former.

It's similar to the hot wallet vs. cold wallet argument - how much are you willing to risk?

Considering that a large number of early bitcoins are probably lost to the void, and more will be lost over time to accident and misfortune, who really cares about this?

Divisibility would be added in *response* to a price increase; it wouldn't *cause* one. To wit:
* Adding a tenth-penny denomination ($0.001) won't make USD worth more. 
* Selling 1/1000 Oz. of gold flakes won't make 1 Oz. of gold any pricier.
* Tacking on an additional decimal won't make Bitcoin more expensive.

Seems to be more akin to a mass panic rather than a true bubble - though maybe a mass panic qualifies as a bubble?
People expecting a tulip-grade financial nuke will likely be disappointed.
