Hey. Thought I'd be funny to come back and say I did indeed hold at 9k. Comfortably even. I'm getting better haha.

Typically from experience 8-10 days pretty consistently.

Good god it's like your talking right to my soul. I need to be better.  Haha.. ha.

I feel like news 101 fits the bill a lot.

You speak very true, nerve short-circuiting words to me.

It looks like a ton of coins are pretty down right now. Not just BTC. Makes me think its not really that much of an issue with BTC specifically.

Persei 8?

Just from memory but, go into settings and then security on desktop version. It should all be right there.

Thought to myself "What if i just buy a full coin?" around 11k. Would not have been a bad idea. Definitely not, didn't do it. Probably should have.

Just broke it. To the moon it goes.

Jesus that is amazing. I wish i had the forthought when i was in highschool 09-11, or pretty much earlier then this fall, to look into bitcoin seriously, i remember hearing about it. Now im probably going to be forever chasing the 1 BTC milestone. Also, YES, film it!

Coinbase locks your price in at the time of purchase if im not mistaken? Even if the bank transfer tanks a bit to complete.

The heart palpitations are real. Bought just a little bit like 60 seconds before this correction we got goin' on here. Not even a drop in the ocean but still so surreal to watch GDAX live. Only 1 thing to do though I suppose. Pipe dreams of a full coin one day may yet still flutter on the horizon.

That would be really cool to see unfold, probably not participate due to increased holiday work hours but maybe potentially get involved in. Hoping for some action over in southern ID.

Only one way to find out. Lets just see where this roller coaster takes us shall we?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:06:07
Wasn't sure i would call it trying to really time anything, just freaked out for a moment. From what i can tell a huge amount of the crypto market is just super down right now, BTC definitely isn't the oddball out. I think right now i just might be a bit too gung ho on loss minimalizing in the short run. I just need to relax bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:16:05
Also, since i did that whole sell/buy thing just now. I now have nearly all of my BTC floating in pending land so there actually no way off this ride for me for a moment at least. Ha.

Happened to me when I tried to enter by for the first time. Bank declined transaction, went in and had it cleared. Coinbase removed the card and gave me the same.error message. Sent a support ticket 2 weeks ago to see if i can get the card added again still haven't heard a thing.
