Ok just a quick update.
I have been very fortunate to have joined the GAW  affiliate program just before the official launch of the Hashlet. In one week I manged to make $431.00 in affiliate commissions an managed to redeem the whole amount for a gift voucher. 
I am happy to announce that I have 22MH happily mining away earning roughly around 0.01350761 per day. 
As of yesterday GAW announced that all Hashlets will out of stock until further notice. Apparently there will be some changes and new features added to the worx. 
Personally I am very happy with GAW ans feel that they have reached every promise they have made with confidence and the Kick Ass attitude that gives them the dege.

Check out the next HASHLET by GAW Miners and drop me your opinion!  I must be honest I am very happy with this product. Previously I have been a member of CEX and only lost money in the long run.
The HASHLET is a bit pricey but worth it! Let's give it a bash and I will keep everyone updated :-)

On Black Friday, GAW will change the industry forever. Introducing The HashStaker.
I am proud to tell you that, one week from today, we will release a completely new kind of cloud miner!
First, we gave you the most advanced cloud miner ever built. Next, we will bring you something that will advance mining into a completely new era! We’ve built something that’s based on technology no one else has. It has never been done before, and it’s unique to GAW.
It’s going to change how mining is done, forever! You’ve never seen anything like it. Of course, Hashlet Primes will have front row seats.
The best coin in the world is going to have the best miner the world has ever seen (and the most profitable).
On Black Friday, GAW will change the industry forever. Stay tuned to see what we have in store for you.
Be ready &amp; Hash on!
P.S. We have not forgotten about all of your other Hashlets. An optional upgrade path is in the works. Naturally, ZenHashlets will have preference over other Hashlets, but we will make sure that all of you can participate.

GAW as a Primary Market Maker
This is where we come in. GAW will be one of many Market Makers (Prime Controller owners) who will make Paycoin successful. We thought long and hard about how we could not only create a market for Paycoin (Paybase), but share that success with the people who made this company what it is today! HashStaker is our way of bringing this all together.
GAW Miners will invest tens of millions of dollars to earn as many Prime Controllers as we can, to obtain as much of the total stake rate for Paycoin as possible. We’ll then distribute that stake rate to you in the form of a special Prime Controller-connected wallet that we will host for you within Zencloud.
The Solution is Here
Today, we take an enormous step forward in mining, bigger than this company and its customers have ever made before. From this point forward, you can say goodbye to the days of slaving away to keep up with the “difficulty curve”, dealing with declining payouts, and paying for electric costs and maintenance fees that eat into your payouts.
Today, we introduce an entirely new class of currency generating device.
We Call it the HashStaker – The World’s First Cloud Staking Wallet.
HashStaker is not a Hashlet. It’s an entirely new generation of currency generating devices; one that works with Prime Controllers and Proof of Stake. We’ve taken everything you love about mining, and created a product where you can more reliably judge its profitability over time.
Of course, this means exactly what you would expect: You will be able to generate next-generation PoS cryptocurrencies, like Paycoins, more reliably and profitably than ever before. However, here is the thing, HashStaker works on a completely new generation of currency technology, that no one else has, like PoS utilizing Prime Controllers.
HashStaker wallets payout new currency and use next-generation technology that makes them capable of things you could only dream of with a traditional mining rig. Features like:
No-drops in payouts for their entire lifespan.
Complete immunity to difficulty increases.
Zero maintenance fees. Forever!
The highest payouts of any miner, period.
Customizable – only buy what you need.
Guaranteed 99.99% uptime.
And, the most exciting thing about HashStakers is their profitability!
At our planned investment amount, your HashStakers will consistently reach ROI in 2.5-4.5 months! What miner can do that? :grinning[:)]:
And, we’ve only scratched the surface. You will soon be able to trade them, sell them, and amp them when Hashbase is released.
How do HashStakers Work
A HashStaker is a cloud based “Super Wallet” that we host for you in your ZenCloud account,, and leave open so it can stake. Since they are installed on our servers, they will stake at a rate equal to all the Prime Controllers GAW is managing.
Here is the breakdown:
Since HashStakers are cloud based wallets, they require coins to start staking. The first HashStaker we built is for Paycoin, and we will add more in the future.
Paycoin HashStaker wallets require a Paycoin to be in the HashStaker wallet for it to stake, of course. Once you transfer your Paycoin to it, your HashStaker will start to stake, and be paid out each day with the normal daily payout times.
HashStaker’s wallets are customizable. You can choose the size (how many Paycoins they can hold), and the duration of time you want them for, which means you only need to pay for the time you want. We are starting with three and six month time frames, adding more intervals in the future.
Once you select the HashStaker you want, it will appear in ZenCloud just like Hashlets do.
When the Prime Round starts (explained below), the final stake rate will be established. As an added measurement of comfort, you will have 24 hours to return the HashStaker for a full refund if you are not happy with the rate.
Once the Prime Round starts, your HashStaker stake rate and wallet address will display on your HashStaker. You then have the ability to transfer your Paycoin to the HashStaker wallet.
Transferring coins to your HashStaker activates it, starts staking your coins with GAW’s Prime Controllers, and locks in your payout at that round’s rate for your entire HashStaker duration (three or six months).
It will payout to your ZenCloud wallet each day like your normal Hashlet payouts. Transferring your Paycoin to your HashStaker wallet will also start the timer.
Once the HashStaker expires, it will transfer the original Paycoin back into your ZenCloud account and be done staking.
The First Prime Round
When Paycoin officially debuts, mid-December, GAW will bid on Prime Controllers to compete for one of the highest staking potentials on the Paycoin network.
This total stake rate will then be controlled and owned by HashStaker owners.
Let me make this absolutely crystal clear. GAW’s entire Paycoin Prime Controller stake rate will be owned by, and distributed to HashStaker owners. And, since Prime Controllers go back into bidding every six months, HashStakers will work on a 6-month round system, which lock-in their rates for that entire period.
This means your profitability is guaranteed for the entire duration that your HashStaker is active. Not everyone can own a HashStaker, but everyone who owns one will be profitable.
Round One Start Date: Mid-December
Round One estimated payout: Between .0075 and .01 Paycoins per day
These numbers are based on our mining and investments made thus far in the ICO. We will declare the final number once the round begins.
Today, HashStaker Wallet Reservations Start
One of the many things that make HashStakers different from traditional miners is scarcity.
There is no restriction on how much traditional mining hardware can be created – that should be clear to everyone by now, looking at global hash rates. Theoretically, everyone on the planet could own a miner.
Not so with HashStakers. There is a hard limit on the amount of HashStaker Wallets that can exist.
When all HashStaker wallets are sold from GAW’s Prime Controller inventory for each Prime Round (which lasts six months), no more HashStakers can exist for that round. At that point, the only way to obtain one is in in the Hashbase Market, shortly after Hashbase launches.
Today, we are selling the first HashStaker wallet reservations for the first Prime Round, starting in mid-December. Once you have reserved your HashStaker wallet, that address will belong uniquely to you.
You can return your HashStaker for a full refund up until 24 hours after the Prime Round starts, for any reason. If you request a return, your HashStaker wallet address will be released back to the pool of wallet addresses to be purchased.
How Does Ordering Work?
I know this is exciting and sounds all very new. But, don’t worry. Setting up a HashStaker is easy:
Head to ZenCloud or GAW Miners to purchase your HashStaker Wallet.
Decide the size of the HashStaker (amount of coins it can hold), and if you want it for a full or half Prime Round duration (three or six months). HashStakers cannot be merged or split, but you can buy them in any configuration and have as many as you want until they are sold out.
Obtain Paycoin – Either through the second ICO round, or buying coins from Paybase (a single one or multiple, depending on your HashStaker size).
Once Round One Stake rate is declared, staking period can start.
Transfer Paycoins from your Paycoin Wallet to your HashStaker.
Enjoy getting daily payouts that never decrease.
It’s that simple. Since each HashStaker is its own wallet, each HashStaker has its own wallet address. Once the first Prime Round starts, you will receive a HashStaker wallet address for your reserved HashStaker.
Transferring coins to your HashStaker activates it to start staking your coins with GAW’s Prime Controllers, and locks in your payout at that round’s rate for your entire HashStaker duration (three or six months). And, when it expires, the coins inside automatically transfer back to your ZenCloud account.
Remember, you can return your HashStaker for a full refund for up to 24 hours after round one stake rate is declared.
Disclaimer: The HashStaker Wallet price is relative to the stake rate. The higher the stake rate, the more valuable a HashStaker Wallet is. We have provided a range on what the Round One stake rate will be (in first Prime Round section).
To provide the best value to our customers, we started at a lower price ($9.95). Depending on demand, we reserve the right to increase new HashStaker purchases.
Once the Round Once Stake rate is declared, we will increase the HashStaker Wallet prices for new purchases to match the locked in Stake Rate.
Current Hashlet Owners
We haven’t forgotten about you. You will soon have the choice to upgrade to HashStakers. Next week, we announce the upgrade path for Primes, Zens, and other Hashlets.
We have to limit the time, obviously, because the number of HashStakers available is limited, which means we have to carefully control our HashStaker inventory.
But, all Hashlet Primes already have a HashStaker Wallet reserved. Why? Because you’re Prime :grinning[:)]:.
Taking the Next Step Forward
From this day onward, cryptocurrency will never be the same.
HashStaker changes everything about mining. With features like being refundable, zero maintenance fees, locked in payouts, scarcity, no difficulty increases, guaranteed up-time with complete insurance coverage, and ROIs like never before. HashStakers are, without a doubt, the biggest leap forward in mining we’ve ever offered. Period.
In the future, people will look back at the history of mining and wonder why it wasn’t this way all along.

GAWMiners’ Hashlet Sells More in Bitcoin Sales Per Day than Overstock
Just over a week ago the, “Hashlet frenzy” occurred at the launch of GAWMiner’s Hashlet. 
A portion of the Shopify network went down from the massive surge in sales. GAWMiner now sells more in Bitcoin sales per day than Overstock does, much thanks to the Hashlet. 
A couple days ago GAW sold out of the Hashlet and are currently claiming to relaunch 08/29/14. 
As of yet everyone is on the edge of there seats eagerly awaiting the new launch of the infamous Zencloud Hashlet. At this very moment if you visit the official GAW website you will land on a new page boasting what appears to be a whole new range of Hashlet in different colors. 
There is no doubt that once GAW opens it'd doors again there will be another frenzy and buzz around again. 
Stay posted and hopefully in a couple hours you can be one of the first to discover or purchase what the new Hashlet has to offer
