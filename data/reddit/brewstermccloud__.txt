Couldnt BTC become rekt if someone started linking to CP on the blockchain?

Hodlmoon.com I believe? They also have ETH sweaters

So did Satoshi.

There are no keys. Everything is on paper, and I would imagine that withdrawal will be more complicated than Binance.

When can I get on Prism?
It's literally my most hyped thing in crypto right now. I think it's a fantastic idea.

No, he's pretty much spent all of his BTC on real stuff. 
What's funny is, if you read through Bitcointalk, you can find threads where people gave him full BTCs in 2016 for being such a legend and a man of action. Of course, he spent those as well

Prism is a portfolio market. You can essentially make gains by having a good portfolio, as well as the ability to hold crypto assets without actually dealing with the coins (you can always cash out the actual coins whenever). Everything would be done through Shapeshift. It's a game changer.

We are both operating on assumptions. My assertion is that Szabo = Satoshi is an overly simple conclusion that doesn't take into consideration the MANY bitcoin precursors and equally brilliant cryptographers that aren't memed to death by bitcoin detectives. 
Personally, I think Szabo would have disappeared at some point if it was him. Stylometrics are only getting better.

Satoshi would be revolted

Anyone who thinks it was Szabo hasnt actually read any cypherpunk stuff

What a god. I've always love how zen and pragmatic this guy is.
What's funny too is, many have assumed that, as an early adopter, he would be rich from BTC. But he's always used it as actual currency, and IIRC owns way less than 1 BTC at this point.
