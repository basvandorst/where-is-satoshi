As I see it Bitcoins will be going nowhere fast and will only continue to be accepted in more places over time. Its kinda funny over a year ago I thought it was just a passing fad, but how wrong I was.  The amount of online sites and offline shops who are starting to use bitcoin is pretty amazing now,  and I think over more time Bitcoin will become even more popular with sites like Wikipedia. We allready have some big well known sites using bitcoin like namecheap for one so its only a matter of time

I am self employed and allready pay way to much taxes :( and all our governments do is waste it anyway, why should we give them more to waste lol, but on a more serious side,  I think that if Bitcoin does not become somehow accountable by the Gov they will kill it off one way or the other and the people not paying taxes on it will get caught in the end. Being self employed you know not to mess about with trying to avoid not paying your taxes.

The website owners have the choice,  they can either re-list the site after the 100 days for FREE again or if they want a featured listing for a longer period then they can pay for it. Its thier choice. Damm I am offering a directory for websites who accept bitcoins or other cryptocoins which has both free and paid options for the site owners and you guys think its spam ? If they send me an email after the 100 day listing has run out I will just relist it for them again for Free so they dont even have to go through the submitting process again.

Are you stupid ? When the listing runs out they can just re -submit the site for another 100 days if they want to.  Dear oh dear some people shouldent been on the internet lol allways so negative

Maybe it was wrong of me to say that.  I make a site for bitcoin users to submit sites to,  and it gets called spam ? That pissed me off because it is not spam or anything like spam at all. The guy most prob clicked on the site took a look at the plans and thought "yep this is spam " and im gonna go post it on reddit saying it is spam.  He could have at least asked or even sent me an email before writting crap like that, so yes im sorry im kinda pissed at it. And wtf has my grammer or spelling got to do with the site anyway. I dont give two shits about my typos or grammer errors tbh so I dont know why it bothers you so much. Jeese some people.
