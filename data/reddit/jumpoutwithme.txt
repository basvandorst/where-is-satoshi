Past performance is not indicative of future results. A tale as old as time.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:02:45
Yeah but then you end up giving them some lame printed out piece of paper. I wanted something higher quality. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:11
But why are you on this holy mission? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:04:38
Why are all of your comments just negative remarks about Bitcoin? Why are you even wasting your time if you don't care about it? Wouldn't you rather be spending your time browsing things you actually like?

If it's 100% the fees why is Bitcoin Cash, ETH, and LTC also going down?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:46
You'll be gloating about that in a month
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:21:27
So maybe you BCH guys should think about that before bashing BTC nonstop
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:17
They make a hell of a lot of money on fees. I doubt there is a conspiracy to prevent selling.

Overstock keeps half of all BTC payments as BTC and is a big part of why their stock has done well recently.

Still an unusually high amount. I've been watching the order book on GDAX for a while and haven't seen a buy or sell order that high.

I would say first check for any unauthorized transactions, then move all you funds to a private wallet. Also you should have 2 factor authentication enabled everywhere you can.

Yes great to see the market is very liquid and can handle large volumes without breaking a sweat.
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:31:06
no, that's not next, but thanks for playing.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:41:32
lonely much?
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:07:29
yeah it's the total asks at that price. it got filled down to 500 then qty went back up to 800 and now it's down to 476.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:18:43


which one?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:56:32
Yup, just read the comments on their net neutrality post. The guy who posted it is getting skewered for being for net neutrality. ��

I tried them out a couple of months ago but the site was so buggy I just left. With all that money they raised you'd think the site would be top notch.

Since there's no way to buy it instantly (you would need to either ACH or direct deposit from your bank, which takes days) you might be better off paying the coinbase fees rather than waiting and having the price of BTC go even higher. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:07:53


What is this about?
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:08:08
Why do we need yet another ICO to do this? You can make a fairly easy system that works just like Acorns or the hundreds of other companies that do this. You don't need funding, you don't need an ICO and you sure as hell don't need yet another coin. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:42:21
Nor should you. Your assumption that the return on BTC will always be more than the interest is just that - an assumption. When North Korea is hurling nukes around the globe, your assumptions might change.
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:08:13
You should be smacked in the face for this scam!
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:04:56
Let's start another one where anyone who wants to participate puts in 0.004 BTC along with their guess (no ranges) and the winner gets the pot. Or we can be generous and the winner gets 80% and 2nd place gets 20%. Any way to do this with a smart contract but with BTC funds?
