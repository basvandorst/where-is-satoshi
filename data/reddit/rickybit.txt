Believe me, there will always be corrections. This won't end well, so I'm out now.

True, I will hold until I'm a millionaire. Remind me in 1 year.

They will start collecting tax for trading Bitcoin in Vietnam? Is this good news?
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:43:03
I guess most people here own 1BTC
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:16:23
Of course, the price will crash, but it will recover in a few months.

It is based in Halong, Vietnam

Have you tried this? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:02:02
This won't end well. :(
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:26:37
$1k is ridiculous. I think the lowest it could drop is $2k.

It's true, man. I am from China and I've just watched the news. You should see English news in a few hours.

My prediction is $1500
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:54:30
I sold 200 bitcoins yesterday and waiting the price to hit $1500.
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:10:41
There are a lot of software and hardware wallets out there. I keep all in my Trezor.

This won't end well. :(

The price can't go up forever, people should stop being delusional and think they can be rich in a few months.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:46:05
I sold 80% of my Bitcoin to protect benefit. So disappointed with the vulnerable market. :(
@_date: 2017-09-04 07:02:17
Be careful! You should check Coinmama reviews online first.

I recommend you to buy before the fork as you will have a stake in both chains. Buying after the fork is too risky, you don't know which chain will dominate.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:32:17
So it's official. What a terrible week for Bitcoin :(
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:08:59
Wohoo I knew it. Just bought in 10 btc.

I just wish I have more money to buy Bitcoin now. :(
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:44:14
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:41:39
Can someone explain? All of the pools have to signal for Segwit to activate it?
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:06:46
No phone wallet is safe. I'd recommend buying a Trezor
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:27:43
Not a good idea to hodl now as the price will keep falling. I'd recommend you to sell now and buy back in mid August. You will own more Bitcoin than you do now.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:47:11
I just sold all of my BTC after watching the video, probably will buy it back by tomorrow morning.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:16:21
This is crazy. The Bitcoin price will plummet if it's true.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:26:41
Awesome. I know this would happen.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:55:12
Yes I have 0 BTC now.
