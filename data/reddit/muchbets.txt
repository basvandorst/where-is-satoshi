Why do you seriously think Dorian is most likely Satoshi? This is 100% false ( Please explain why you think this is a truth? Leah Goodman is a sham and only made that report for page views and her 15 minutes of fame. To think that a nobody reporter can track down the creator of Bitcoin and not entire world governments//NSA//DoJ//IRS//FBI, etc. is laughable.

He was not qualified to be CEO of the largest BTC exchange in the world. He refused to step down and let others that were far more capable as a CEO to run it. He is 100% the reason MtGox failed.

[Dorian is NOT Satoshi.] ( // [TechCrunch]( The CEO of a BTC exchange should KNOW this and not believe a report a nobody reporter published for page views and fame.

If it was a company about pencils, I wouldn't care in the least bit. Your company is about BITCOIN and the CEO thinks the creator of BTC is who the media is telling him it is, that is highly disturbing. 99% of the Bitcoin community knows Dorian is not the creator behind Bitcoin but your CEO still does... ?

This makes me sad to read. This is social engineering 101 tactics. I cant believe the hosting company would be so stupid. I would definitely sue them.

You should throw up a simple 'Coming Soon' type landing page on your site. Looks pretty no0by to have the default GoDaddy lander FYI :)

Better to be safe than sorry. Good looking out for these exchanges and companies to take preemptive security measures to protect its customers.
