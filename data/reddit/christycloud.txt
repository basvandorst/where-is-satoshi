The problem has existed for a while, and is present in other blockchain based technology. Notably Ethereum where someone did a paper outlining the process of uploading a series of breasts into the chain via the same method.
The difference is that with a story like this it's significantly more likely that media outlets will pick up on the story, and blow it out of proportion, at that point it becomes FUD.
And calling any fork `simple` is straight up laughable, a hard fork even more so. Like I said, BTC tends to move at a snail pace, and if the media does blow this up, which is yet to be seen, it could quite easily end up in a race of the media trying to demonize BTC and crypto as a whole, vs chain based solutions trying to rectify the problem.

I think that your immediate go-to was to call the other poster a retard probably says more about you then we really need to know.
And yes, whilst it would be possible for bitcoin to adopt a system which discards the additional transaction information it doesn't change the fact that it currently doesn't, and this feature can be abused.
And lets be honest, Bitcoin isn't exactly known for being the most agile entity in the world. If you start a vote now, we may see some progress come 2020.

ITT People mindlessly defend bitcoin claiming FUD despite the fact you can literally see it happening.

I'm lost, is this a typo on the idea of referring to water as h2o/Dihydrogen Monoxide or am I genuinely missing something here
