The business changes over time. They used to use a full phone number for texting; now they have a shortcode. Likewise, they probably found Bitcoin either had no demand or required extra work.

Find out the stats on the miner you might buy, and plug in the numbers. (Spoiler: it won't be profitable) For instance, the fastest you can get, the AntMiner s9, costs about $2000 and will earn you about $850 or so before it costs more to operate than it returns.
This only changes if you think Bitcoin will go up in price, but in every situation where Bitcoin rises in price, you earn more by buying Bitcoin directly.

This has been discussed many many times before: there was no reduced supply, only a reduced rate of the increase of supply. As not all mined coins are for sale, the effect on market supply is limited to the difference between was previously for sale and what is now produced. If the previous amount was less than 50% of what was mined, 0 effect.

Typically a site will be using a processor like Bitpay, Coinbase, or Stripe. Those providers will lock the price at the moment you order, for enough time for you to send the coin. (In the case of Coinbase, it can come from your wallet; others you send to a Bitcoin address). The price is denominated in Bitcoin at that point, so even if the exchange rate moves, your price in Bitcoin is good as long as you send in that time window. If not, you have to try again at the new rate (varies by cart). Keep in mind that for your transaction to process reasonably, you'll need to attach a fee per your wallet (typically $0.08 - see

Except for the fact that the price has risen year-over-year every year but one, and more than once, over 10x in a year. I think 7x from here at some point in the future isn't unreasonable given that. It may be irrational exuberance, but there's observable patterns in that irrationality.

It's not different than if you bought stocks or fiat currency or gold bars with the money. If you try to hide assets from the bankruptcy court, you're in trouble.

(keep in mind we're talking "Declare yourself broke" not simply defaulting on the loan without declaring bankruptcy)

Then no company can ever have a "new low", since every company is worth $0 at some point. 
Typically "new low" in stocks refers to the price history since IPO. With Bitcoin, this is a bit nebulous, since there's not a central exchange. Using Mt. Gox as the first really viable exchange however, Bitcoin initially sold for around $0.01. 
Of course maybe this is all irrelevant since price history as we know it is based on USD. Maybe in the world depicted here the prevailing exchange rate is BTC/Libra. :-)

It's not simple correlation. Buying surged because anyone who held at the fork got free money. Though it's up in the air whether the momentum that continued was related to that fork, but the BTG fork had a similar, but smaller, effect. I think there was some buying that resulted due to FOMO over potential additional forking.

If it never goes any higher, Bitcoin is a phenomenal success. However, when people reassure each other "will moon", they are talking about another epic bull run with 10x-20x gains. We may have to wait another couple of years before we see that again, IF it occurs.

The usual contrived example.
Cannabis by itself has intrinsic value (you can get high off of it, for example)
Currency has derived value.
Another failure in your analogy: I never said Bitcoin would be illegal; the strategy is to attack the thing that makes it valuable, which is the ability to exchange it (quickly and electronically) for fiat.
But yes, prior to exchanges, you could do very manual bartering. We would at least still have a market cap of 3,600 pizzas.

No, it's a sign that mining can ROI. Mining revenue is still mostly block rewards, not fees.

2. How have you only made 9% in Bitcoin, a market up 1300% on the year? That's like what any random jerk-off could have made throwing money in for the first time 4-5 days ago. Hell, owning Bitcoin pre-BCH fork would get you 9% just from the fork.

Bitcoin is 9 years old, and has been traded for 8. So look at each one of those companies 8 years post-IPO, and they weren't doing nearly as well as BTC's price. In other words, based on your comparison, if BTC stays flat or goes down, it will still have exceeded the success of those companies.

Remember that for a while, you could get Bitcoin out, but not fiat. So as a result, coins were trading at a premium to other exchanges. That meant you could get out clean, but if you stuck around and somehow Gox turned the corner and restored withdrawals, in theory you'd win big. 
So it's not simple victim-blaming, but a perception that greed kept the victims that using the clearly marked exit and playing ball somewhere else.

Here's the kicker: transactions on exchanges *are* adoption. The mere presence of speculation means there will be some transactions even if people stop selling socks for BTC.
Price also falls (and rises) for reasons that have nothing to do with adoption. Exchanges are filled with "investors" who really don't care about adoption but are rather reacting to others. 


I agree. I only submit that their definition of profit is different than a trader. Equipment is a sunk cost, unless they're on a lease. Therefore they only need to cover electricity cost to be profitable. The chart can be covered in red candles and they're still making money.

I don't understand that. The price has been declining or stagnant with no sign or reversal for nearly a year and a half. If anything, it's the bulls who are desperate, since the price has barely moved 10 or 15 points and they think it's a sign that it's October 2013.

Not sure how you could monetize it. Aside from activity like article about Dorian or what's going on with Craig, Satoshi is a non-story since (s)he is in pretty much dormant. (so the content + advertising strategy may not work)
You could do something like a What Would Satoshi Do? Report on current Bitcoin events (block size debate, startups, etc) with a twist: try to honestly identify what Satoshi's opinion would be using evidence from the white paper, forum posts, etc.

Did you see the found block on the blockchain? Or did you just have 25 coins show up in your account? I wonder if cloud mining companies, which are usually fake (they put money in your account slowly to keep up the ruse) would pick "winners" so there's "proof" for testimonials and to get folks like yourself hooked. (Just like the late night TV preachers who have stories of those who magically got $5000 or $10000 "from God" - giving away $10,000 to get $100,000 in donations to keep the story of miracles alive is just a cost of doing business)
So I think it's deeper than letting Bitcoin ruin your life, it's letting the equivalent of a carnival huckster take your money, or giving in to a local crack dealer in the hopes of regaining that first high.

Sure thing - I'm just pointing out that your definition is pretty narrow. If I owned $1M in real estate, or $1M in Apple stock, I'd be rich. If you have a lot of money in BTC, you wouldn't have cashed it all out by now, as you'd pay taxes when you converted from crypto to fiat. You'd cash out over time, so I think your definition as being rich only based on cashed out amount is narrow.

The American Civil War was caused by a serious threat to the business model of a major economic output, resulting in a large part of the nation declaring independence.

Not really. First, you'll have to buy Bitcoin without your partner knowing, unless they don't care what you do with the Bitcoin you buy. In that situation, it's just as simple to get a second credit card and pay the bill with a money order, or get a pre-paid card. Or use cash.

Buffet says he doesn't invest in anything he doesn't understand.

Is there a concrete way to put a value on Bitcoin? Talking about the tech isn't. (cryptography works the same at $2 as $2000) Talking about libertarian ideals isn't. How do you price the thing in a way that isn't based on fuzzy hopes in the distance?

Invest equal amounts in something else (say a mutual fund) and in Bitcoin. Show them the results each month. Demonstrate some transactions to them. Turn it from a "me vs. them" moment to an opportunity to educate them and show them that you're an adult, worthy of trust. 
As for doing it without their permission, that's between you and them. I get the whole, "you're an adult, you can make your own decisions". However, many think that your parents should let you live there rent free etc just for being born. Part of being an adult is being responsible for yourself. Decide if you want to be 100% an adult, or if you want to hold on to a few of those privileges of childhood. Once you've made that decision, figure out what that means for your parents' expectations.

I think there's a very high number who are in Bitcoin due to the promise of profit, and who would happily fill their bank accounts with exchanged fiat when the price is right. There's no royal "we" - there's your use case (which is very legit) and the use case of speculators (which is also very legit). The latter is driven by profit, and could care less about disruption.

Let me guess, it'll be $2300. Or $23,000. 
I hope you're right, but the price has been under $400 for about 9 months, and $300 for about 6. The trendline is down for over a year.
There will hopefully be some events to take things in a positive direction, but I don't think it'll jump that much. The most optimistic I see is $500-600 in two years.

Bitcoin is 9 years old. 
Microsoft didn't have an initial Internet strategy, but by 1995, released Internet explorer (only 3-4 years after the web came into existence). By the 9 year mark, IE was incredibly dominant. (so much so that in 2000 they were found guilty of having so much of a focus on the Internet and abusing their competition, they were found guilty of anti-trust violations, though it was later overturned)

I thought you meant Google Auth wasn't around; perhaps you mean it wasn't an option for this use case? If an exchange in January 2018 was still using SMS and not offering Google Auth, then that's a sign of a shitty exchange. 
As for Authy, I've never been able to install it on a new device (even on the same phone number - I switch phones about once a year) and access my saved tokens without entering a password. Perhaps that's just my settings and not the default however. I do know that Coinbase deprecated their Authy support, moving to TOTP, so I'm sure that had something to do with it.


Just the idea that SMS auth was the only option. There are many many exchanges, and if in January 2018 a text message is all that protected $24M, you're an idiot who chose your online wallet poorly.

Many more "normies" were holding coins they themselves mined. There wasn't as many options for moving your funds around. The fight was with regulatory agencies, not a fork and from inside.

I don't know their initial investment, though I do know they took money in December. (CA$115M - hardly a small business)
It's apparent you just want to believe that Genesis is the magical goose that lays golden eggs. What's your ROI so far? Most estimates seem stuck on a linear payout without taking into consideration difficulty adjustments. 
Just punch in the numbers into any calculator that doesn't ignore difficulty adjustments. For example, on the $179 contract, you make less than $3 before you start to lose money. (day 41) Per Genesis, they'll only run the miner for 60 days after that. They keep the first $0.28 you make every day, so even if you think you'll accumulate Bitcoin at a loss, it's not for long. 
For fun I pretended Bitcoin goes up to $100,000. Guess what? You end up making a profit of $133.

When Mt. Gox opened (July 2010) price was about $0.07 per Bitcoin. 
This means only about 300 people could have bought up all the Bitcoin available in 2010 before there was none left. (obviously market increases price as supply dwindles, but you get the point)

You can buy BTC and then transfer it to a wallet you control. 
If you want to mine because it tickles your nerd bone or you want to help secure the network, that's the only reason.

Those metrics would still be true if Bitcoin dropped to $100, and it seems as though real Bitcoin adoption has little to no effect on the price (unless Bitcoin would have free-falled otherwise). To many involved in Bitcoin for profit, VC and startups don't matter if they've lost money.

You don't understand what I'm saying.
It's fresh in the minds of the community that Electrum.com was distributing a scam wallet. No one in their right mind would launch on a site on a supposedly similar domain, or at least, they're not going to risk $8400 on a domain. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:06:31
Domain names are infinite. (number of words X multiplicative effect x languages) Even if you exhaust one namespace, just add another TLD. Moreover, domains don't really sell for that much. Yeah, you can find examples, but aside from short one word domains in English, they're a minimal investment. I buy short (less than 8 character) or combination of 2 very common words domains all the time - $1500 is the most I've ever paid, and that was for a domain that mapped to a business that had been around for 5 years; by itself it would have been worth less than $100. I could spend $X on domains or a food truck, and the food truck will probably be the better investment.

Yes, except they already have purchased the machine when they take lease fees; that's a sunk cost. If I buy mining capacity, I don't wait for them to purchase and install the equipment. Those fees could pay for future equipment, but in both cases, there's more money for future capital expenditures in the situation where they keep 100% of the profit. 
That's like capital expenditures financing 101.

He's a rich white guy who made his money in software: no different than Andreesen (a16z, invested in Coinbase) and Allaire (Circle).

Censorship sucks. The problem of course is who defines what that censorship is. If someone dropped a quarter of a mil, I'm guessing they would think they do at that point. Every community defines its own standards on Reddit; would "stopping censorship" mean stopping deleting of messages that DON'T violate those standards, or would it mean giving you the right to say those standards shouldn't apply? I'm for open mod logs, but that really doesn't stop anything, it just makes it transparent. It doesn't change what mods can and can't do.

Some merchants are very pro Bitcoin. The Dells and Microsofts of the world, however, want a competitive advantage, not to change the world. The only reason they'd hold Bitcoin is if a risk analysis suggested a strong likelihood of value increase.

My opinion is that the more Bitcoin becomes a cash equivalent, the less relevant the price becomes. (Buy with Circle in seconds &gt; buy something in BTC &gt; merchant immediately cashes out) The price a month ago doesn't matter; the price a month from now doesn't matter. Only for those holding does it matter, but the world in general doesn't care. Well, they might care in those precious few moments while Bitcoin is flying around between conversions, but that interval is getting smaller all the time. 
The second part of my idea is when no one cares about value, it'll trend downward. (still working that out in my head, probably more gut than anything else at this point)
So more promotions, partnershps? Awesome! That helps Bitcoin adoption, not necessarily the price.

If your PayPal balance starts to include BTC, it'll probably be segregated, the way they currently handle multiple currencies. (at least according to my experience: I was paid in AUD and had 2 balances, in AUD and USD. I was able to convert - it was quick, but clear that they had to capture information rather than convert in real time)

The Internet wasn't really commercially viable until the Web came along. The Web had a very short period of dormancy. Within 4-5 years you had massive adoption (ISPs, jobs in web development, most companies had a web presence, etc)

You can't ignore the effect of false volume. The largest exchange (at the time) getting caught running a transaction bot? You can't dismiss that. Massive run up in price due to China getting in the game big time, only to later find that some of those exchanges weren't reporting accurate volume? You can't ignore that. I really don't think price corrected. The typical response is to look at today's volume, and say that it's huge without being propped up. Yes, and I think the price is accurate. The market is more mature, and more and more buyers get their bits from tighter run ships like Coinbase and Circle. When the price was $800, $900, $1100, and even on it's way down, that was due to artificial forces. I see the price as a natural progression from the $100 it was at in fall 2013. The problem is that $1000 is not the norm, never was, and probably never will be.

Your post implies that "experiment" success means the moon. The "experiment" might be that Bitcoin can completely change the way money is moved around the globe.

Once it levels out, then I think you'll really see adoption take off, as it becomes less of a gamble.

Simplified explanation: You run a miner to generate Bitcoins, but it gets tougher over time, using more and more electricity to generate Bitcoin. Eventually it will cost you more in electricity than you can generate. At that point, the miner is costing you money to run, so you turn it off. 
There's a lot of good calculators that can help you figure this out, such as  Based on the specs of the Antminer, anything over $125 each would never make back the purchase price. 
(This assumes the Bitcoin price doesn't change, since no one really knows what will happen)
(In case you're curious, if you were able to run them yourself, since your purchase price is $0, you'd make about 0.28 Bitcoins for each miner before it became unprofitable, around Christmas, again assuming the price doesn't change)

Of course not - in the same way that at this time last year, it hadn't lost almost 2/3 of its value in 4 short months. ($266 -&gt; $100) 
Let's ask someone who had money in Mt. Gox a year ago (and kept it there, the same way I kept my money in the same bank for several years) how much their holdings are worth today. 
When I put my money in the bank, I expect it to be there  in 3 months, or 6 months, or 12, with little change. (excluding some silly fees of course) I don't have to watch it like a hen watches her eggs. 
Bitcoin is a fun ride, but if I left $1000 in it, in 6 months it might be worth $500 or $10,000. 
The point is that bank account to Bitcoin comparisons are a bit ridiculous, because they're so radically different. One day hopefully that won't be the case. Honestly, I think the relative stability in price over the past few months (last week or so notwithstanding) is pretty awesome for Bitcoin's long term promise.

It has the potential to exacerbate it. 
Taxation is still up in the air. Cash transactions happen all the time that aren't taxed, but by law should be. Electronic transactions are hard to hide, and usually end up getting taxed. I think the game changes with Bitcoin. Thus, you'll see money leaking out of the government coffers, making less available for social programs.
Mining: to have any hope of profitable Bitcoin mining requires several thousands of dollars to get started.
Acquiring Bitcoins: Exchanges have substantial requirements: identity verification (note tremendous backlash when ID requirements placed on voting) and a bank to do ACH transactions. To purchase without delay, you need a credit card (on Coinbase at least). There's LocalBitcoins, but always at a higher price - so paying with cash becomes a poor tax.
Knowledge: A social equality concern is that of education. (Speaking to general trend, not the outliers) Allegedly smart people get their Bitcoins stolen regularly; what happens to those with a 3rd grade reading level? There's a lot of opportunity for victimization of the poor here.

I've had a Bitcoin position since June 2011. I had a position when it was $2. I understand the fundamentals of what makes Bitcoin revolutionary, and I understand that its price is partially a product of market psychology.

Hell, a Bitcoin today has far more utility than it had when it was $1100 (think Dell and Newegg and Overstock), but the price is what the price is.

No doubt: in 20 or 40 years, I'm sure Bitcoin be rocking too. 
Remember that the Internet wasn't invented in 1992; it was invented in the late sixties, or if you want to be more realistic, the main protocol (TCP/IP) was invented in 1982. I'm pretty sure that very few small time investors from 1982 are rich today because of their investment. 
Even if I assume you meant the Web, how many investors from the early 90's stuck with the infrastructure providers and didn't get distracted by all the Pets.com type startups? Even if you got lucky and were in something like the Netscape or Yahoo IPO, if you didn't have enough sense to shift your investment, your returns over time were mediocre.

You'd need to mine for 2 months, and then power off (or sell) your miners. Difficulty will mean you'll be spending money on electricity, every month. As difficulty goes up, the higher your electricity cost goes up, while the amount of BTC produced goes down. 
If you start tomorrow, with most equipment, you'll have spent more on electricity and other costs than you earned in Bitcoin by January. And it only gets worse from there. Your only hope is if the price of Bitcoin goes up. But if Bitcoin went to $2000, you'd only postpone losing money until May; if it went to $5000, you'd be in the black until July. 
For Bitcoin to be remotely worth it, either the difficulty drops way down (everyone stops mining) or the technology significantly increases (meaning the value of BTC would probably go down as it'd be easier to mine, so it's unlikely there will be a net gain)
Maybe you'll stumble across a time machine. If so, drop off in late 2009, and get rich. That's pretty much your only hope. 
You may not trust others with your $$, but it sounds like you don't trust math either. If you really want to lose money by mining for 2 years, you should instead donate the thousands of dollars you're planning on burning to the charity of your choice.

Banks becoming obsolete may refer to PayPal rising up. I've done a ton of work where I was paid via PayPal, and spent the money via my PayPal debit card. Then there's the argument about whether the credit card network is part of the banking system, but aside from that, it's entirely possible to be a full participant in the modern economy and never have a bank account (though there's the chicken/egg issue, if your PayPal account required a bank connection ... perhaps in the future you can "back" your PayPal account with a BTC address)

I appreciate your taking into account the cash-out fee, in which case, you're right, WU is more expensive. You have to agree that the argument that Bitcoin only costs the transaction fee is completely wrong unless the recipient cashes out immediately, which seems to what everyone else is regurgitating. Sometimes, if a few hours or days pass (you have a lot of flexibility as to when you can cash out WU), the Bitcoin transaction will cost more than the WU transaction, and sometimes, they'll actually profit if Bitcoin goes up. The bottom line is that WU is pretty much a known quantity, no matter when you get the $. Bitcoin is anything but, and there are many who need their $ transfers to be guaranteed regardless of when the recipient cashes out. (I'm sure this is a great problem for a startup to solve: BitPay like cash-out for individuals)

What's a reasonable time period to review? When someone says it's down over 7 days, or 30 days, or whatever, the past 18 months are brought up. However, as more time goes by, the more deeply the downtrend is embedded. It's only a couple of months before we're a year since the ATH. Where will it be? Even 50% of the ATH? What about 6 months after that? Will it be reasonable to say, "forget the last 18 months, remember 2013!"

No. There may be a short jump here and there, but for several months the price always retreats afterwards. Over the long run, I think you'll see a gain, so treat it that way. (I setup a buy on Coinbase every 2 weeks for a fairly small amount, and have accumulated over time)

I don't think 5 year returns on a 5 year investment mean anything about the future. You couldn't even trade until summer 2010, and the market was filled with uncertain, borderline scammy companies. I think we have to look at the availability of a mainstream market, which I think is much younger, about a year and a half old.

At this point, 80% of your wealth isn't in Bitcoin. If you bought at $1200 x 200 = $240,000; 80% means your other 20% is $60K. So 200 coins X $300 = $60,000, therefore Bitcoin represents 50% of your net worth. If you hadn't sold, it'd be 40% ($40,000 of total $100,000). Its contribution to your net worth is its value, not cost basis.

Yeah, I'm sure it'll get back to $460, but honestly I don't know that it'd double in a reasonable period to pay back a loan. To make regular payments, you'd need to profit and sell off BTC at a rate of 100%/loan periods. (so 12 months, 8% a month). Then you'd only break even.
And I'm not entirely sure the break-even point is below $230. I believe for many it's much higher, but they're operating at a loss, hanging on to the hope that they'll see $800 or $1000 or higher before they have to turn them off for good.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:41:24
All of the advantages you mentioned require the network to operate. While there are some benevolent miners, most are driven by profit. Mining has a very real expense (electricity/equipment/labor/etc). There's a price, probably well above $1, where it becomes irrational to mine. If mining stops, the transactions stop, and all the advantages go away. The counterargument is that this will cause difficulty to go down and increase rationality of mining - this is true, but it doesn't happen in real time. I think if Bitcoin gets into that kind of yo-yo cycle it'll totally undermine the dependability of the currency. It'll be an interesting way to move funds around, but it'll lose its revolutionary aspects (which to believe this sub, is the destruction of Western Union, credit cards, and the US government)

Doesn't it seem though that control of Bitcoin is moving increasingly into the hands of institutional and corporate hands, that the "Bitcoiners" are becoming increasingly less influential? 2014 without a doubt was the best year with regard to adoption and mainstream access, yet the price. 
Beyond the "big interests", there's a lot of individuals in Bitcoin that wouldn't identify themselves as a "Bitcoiner"; to them it's just an asset class.

If I were super rich in an asset that leaves virtually no recourse once it's stolen, I probably wouldn't advertise the fact. 
The truly rich aren't going to be those holding bits, it'll be those building services like Coinbase. Everyone loves to compare Bitcoin to the Internet. (the WWW actually, even though they say Internet) The early web was mostly run by the nerds, but as it became mainstream, became controlled more and more by big money interests. 
At the end of the day, if Bitcoin succeeds, it'll do what every successful innovation does: make rich white guys richer.

I agree Bitcoin adoption will continue to get bigger. I don't understand why this means improved price, however. No one needs to hold Bitcoin: you want to act on it, there's many options for instant buys.

However, the many BTC scams that keep popping up leverage the unique properties of the currency. These scams simply couldn't be accomplished using the existing fiat infrastructure.

Even when I slipped up on payments they let me just jump back on the payment plan. Oh yeah, I was supposed to not continue to add to my tax balance (keep taxes paid). But I did, and guess what?

ROI is profit/cost, not gross/cost. So if I buy something for $100 and make back my original $100, my ROI is 0%, not 100%. 
So assuming no difficulty increase, assume your hashing has a steady rate of return. If you break even at 318 days, that means 47 days of profit. Actually, my original math was incorrect; the ROI is more like 15%: (365-318) / 318.

Though you could point out aspects of Bitcoin that are failing. So how about this: HTTP=ability to rapidly send value that can be quickly converted back to fiat. gopher=ability to be one's own bank (both advantages of gopher and "own bank" are true, but we see the reality has played out differently, as http took hold, as did centralized wallets)

In my opinion, yes. I think a single address that anyone can look up can carry risk of deanonymizing your or your donors. However, the funds in any address should be fairly secure. Depending on your goals, using a service that converts your donations into fiat right away may be a better option for you.

Halving happened on November 28, 2012. For a couple of months, the price nudged up 10-20% - decent, but we see gains like that commonly, hardly an epic bull run. About mid-January it finally started to take off, until we hit the first massive peak in April. (following by late 2013 insanity and the eventual 60-70% drop to today)
So was that bull run caused by halving, or other factors? (Gox shenanigans?)

One day returns are always irrelevant. 
The point isn't that Bitcoin will do well, but that it will outperform mining for Bitcoin. Unless Bitcoin goes on a major bull run (at least doubling) you'll mining will go negative before you hit ROI (within 60-120 days at today's prices); you'd get back only 25% of your investment by that point. So you're at -75%. If you're lucky, you'll resell your equipment at that point for 50% of original price. In that time span, what are odds Bitcoin would be down 25%? Not over one day, but in the 120 days when mining needs to stop. That's how you determine mining vs. buying.

For several months, Gox allowed no fiat out (and then at the very end didn't even allow Bitcoin to be withdrawn). The entire time they were taking deposits though. Of course, while fiat couldn't be withdrawn (but Bitcoin could) Gox traded at a serious premium. Many kept their coins there (even though they could easily transfer out) with the hope of cashing out eventually at the Gox price when fiat opened back up. That day never happened of course, and many lost their Bitcoins as a result once those withdrawals were shut off as well. (Reason why those whose coins got trapped deserve nothing but a big fat  - they had months to get their coins out but greed did them in)

If Bitcoin dies, so does your investment, of course. 
I don't think Bitcoin will die; I think a resolution will eventually occur. If holders lose 25%, 50%, or more, during that time, it won't be the first time the price has crashed. And wouldn't be the worst. 
Solutions should be long term; the short term effect is irrelevant. If you can't stomach seeing the value go down, like I said, you really, really shouldn't be holding Bitcoin. Over time you'll see many events occur that will kill your value over the short term.
tl;dr Long-term issues at stake; your short term investment value doesn't matter

No, you only hit the reset button. They'll buy the same equipment at scale they bought years ago, have several hundreds or thousands of times the hashrate, etc of "ordinary folks". The difficulty will increase, ASICs will get built for the new algorithm, etc. So it's not game over; the best case is they end up losing their current equipment investment.

No. When it's legit, it's far less profitable than just buying and holding.
Think about it: if they have capacity that essentially mints money, and can sell you instant capacity (meaning it's ready to go, as opposed to a capital investment), there's no logic for them to sell you that capacity. 
Best case scenario: cloud mining is legit, and the owners know future difficulty increases will render their equipment unprofitable, so they cash out and pass the loss on to customers in the form of GHs sunk cost.

Of course it's speculation. Every post about price, etc is speculation and in most cases contributes nothing. Nothing wrong with calling it a duck if it quacks. In this case, it quacks loudly: they were hacked, and they closed. I've been in Bitcoin since 2011, and I can't think of a single situation (and there have been many) where a company shut down with someone else's Bitcoins in deposit and those depositors were made whole. Call it speculation. Call me amateur. That doesn't change how this will turn out. Quack. Quack.

Companies like Coinbase are choosing the regulated route, for various business reasons. However, the nature of Bitcoin allows plenty of unregulators players as well, and these unregulated players pose too much risk (in the SEC's mind) to Bitcoin as a whole.
Gemini was an attempt to connect a heavily regulated exchange to the ETF; the SEC said that wasn't enough. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:43:59
As if the ETF is the only variable that could cause a big drop. If the 30 coins represents a large amount of your wealth, I'd reduce your holding to an amount you could stomach a 15-20% drop, which has occurred several times, over a short time span, in Bitcoin's life.

It's only "collapsing" if you see it as permanent growth for alts. Many are moving assets from Bitcoin into alts as alts are performing strongly while Bitcoin slumps.

Difficulty has continued to rise, even as the price of Bitcoin plummeted by 70%+. The difficulty increases by 5-15% each time, a few times a month; the price rarely keeps pace, even when it is increasing. These aren't opinions, but quantifiable. 
A disclaimer is a start, but you still have statements like this:
"That means you will get back the amount you spent on this machine in only 318 days, an ROI of more than 100% a year! You can hardly find any other investment vehicle more profitable than that."
In that 318 days, the same miner's ability to produce hashes will decrease to 50% or more. Not only does this affect that 318 day claim, but future ROI will always be going down. (ignoring the fact that even without difficulty increases, year one ROI for payback in 318 days would be 29%, not 100%.)

Maybe if you consider the Internet was over 20 years old before the web was born. 
Of course if you're talking about the web, it was born in 1989. By the time it was 10 years old, several billionaires had been created, alot of advertising featured web addresses, older companies like Microsoft were putting their energies behind their web strategy, and new companies that are now in the Fortune 500 were created. 
Bitcoin is also ten years old. We're just holding on to hope that we can one day go 12 months without a $100M exit scam.

No. Price moves independent of user base expansion. As it becomes more mainstream, money comes in purely as a speculative play. That momentum is what drives price, and it's just a number on a screen, and the trader doesn't care about block size, online communities, or startups.

I did mine back then. Watched price drop to $2 from $32; I think I had 17 coins. Turned miners off as it wasn't profitable. When the price went back up to $7 or something like that, I sold them all, and liquidated the equipment. I definitely didn't have foresight, but I don't think I'd even call it that.

No. (every four years, when the rate of supply drops in half, this has a slight effect, but never as much as people expect)
Most price fluctuation comes from events outside of Bitcoin (government decisions for example) or from events in the attached ecosystem (a Bitcoin exchange getting hacked). Over time the price has grown more resilient to these influences however.

I've never seen a successful software project run off of donations. Sponsorship from a large corporate benefactor where they pay a full salary, yes. Donations, no.

Except Bitcoin is a protocol and specific implementation, and "the Internet" is a broad term. I'll assume when someone says "the Internet" they're naively meaning "the Web". However, many things on the Web that were once huge have passed (think Real audio, Flash animations, Java applets, standalone instant messengers etc). Netscape was once a hot Internet property.
It's also worth noting that the Web came into being in 1989. By 1999 we were well on our way to mass adoption and IPOs were regularly making millionaires and even billionaires. Keep in mind Bitcoin is over 10 years old now.
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:19:45
Well, that million BTC likely includes coins that turn over several times during a day, so supply is much less than 1M. Point remains, however, that most coins traded aren't freshly minted, which is what halving affects.

I think we all know that. What's relevant today is diminishing supply. Currently Bitcoin trades about 1M coins a day, and 3600 is mined. In a few weeks, daily 1800 is mined. So daily supply will go down by about 0.18%. (and that's assuming miners sell 100%, which they don't)

3 months before the 2012 Bitcoin halving, the price crashed by 50% over a couple of days. Not a "pullback" that took weeks, but literally in a couple of days. 
The price three months after the 2016 halving was actually lower. 
It's tempting to identify the halvings as the sole cause of the 2013 and 2017 ATHs, but to do so is ignorant of other events that affected price (2013: US Senate hearings that went favorably, Willybot; 2017: hype around ETFs and forks)

No, I get that coins are turned over several times. Maybe even freshly minted coins. But let's say each coin, on average, is turned over 20x a day. (probably a high number) That means 50,000 coins changing hands. (of which 3600 are "miner coins")
Looking at it a different way, 3600 coins in exchange volume is 72,000. So that's 7.2%. 
All this assumes a very high average turn-over, and that miners sell 100% of their coins every day.

GBTC only came on the scene after years of unregulated trading. I chose $12 because Bitcoin would have never gained any momentum in the world you describe. As a matter of fact, Bitcoin's best run, in late 2013, was fueled by Chinese investment (good luck regulating that) and the US Senate saying they weren't going to regulate.

That's an awesome power rate. I punched the number in, and saw the same 3 month ROI, but that's only if you assume the block reward doesn't change. At a 12.5BTC reward, the ROI is pushed out from 3 to 12/15 months. (obviously varies by price of Bitcoin) I'm assuming many of the s9's will go online after the halving.
@_date: 2016-06-24 07:33:10
That's the beauty of the market. You'll hear people brag about all the coins they bought at $10 or whatever, but there's little to no friction to taking profit and repurchasing along the way.

I'm well aware of Willy. However, Google the US Senate hearings at the time; the price responded very nicely. Look up the volume changes of the Chinese exchanges in 2013; those volume changes also correspond with price movements. While you're at it, look at the effect that the shuttering of Silk Road had on price; will you suggest that was Mt. Gox as well? All of the above had an affect on price, and to suggest Gox's bot alone triggered the bull run suggests a very poor understanding of history and of markets.

In the past 2-3 years, Bitcoin has moved positively based on various news:
* Coinbase exchange launch
* PayPal rumors (ended up being a loose announcement with BitPay)
* Greece capital controls
* Brexit
* etc
Each time the rally was short-lived, and priced retreated. I suspect we'll see more in the coming months (halving, result of US election, etc) but that we'll see the same pattern, and that overall the price movement will be related to longer term issues, not knee jerks.

Once you get the coins, if your state supports GDAX, and they allow you to setup an account (not sure what the requirements are above a regular Coinbase account) you can set a limit or a stop sell, so that once it hits a certain threshhold it will cash out automatically to get around the monitoring issue.

Of course it doesn't. However, anything that involves a banking system (ie, exchanges that let you transfer in and out fiat) do, and governments can definitely influence exchange rate. Live by the Chinese rally, die by the Chinese rally. Bitcoin still has the same utility at $800 as at $8.

"Ending Bitcoin" has a couple of meanings. The protocol can never be ended. That's what everyone parrots in these conversations. Hell, Paycoin still exists too by that criteria.
However, the market rate for Bitcoin is where the value is for most. There's a number of actions that could seriously impact it. I know it's all memetastic to go on about honeybadgers and whatnot, but we've seen how fickle the price can be (Craig Wright, Silk Road, Coinbase exchange announcement, etc)

Yes, but that's usually during a time when there isn't a halving.
If you were to bring one online after the halving, even with great electricity price OP was quoting, you won't break even unless price goes way up or average difficulty increase goes way down (which may happen given the number of miners who may go offline after the halving)
If you go online now with an s9, you'll come out ahead $500 when it's all said and done. (18 months or so)

One point for clarification: you'll hear everyone parrot about difficulty changes. However, **difficulty does not change in real time.** It changes every 2016 blocks. So if mining dropped substantially between difficulty changes, for a period of time, the last difficulty change would presumably be high enough for the miners left that block generation would take much longer than previously.

So out of all coins with said value (of course many are out of play, like Satoshi's), each day N are added. My position is that N is already a pretty small %, and that N/2 will have a minimal delta of %. That is true whether actively traded, or held and valued.

It's only happened once: 
The price modestly gained for a few weeks leading up to it and afterward (11/1/12: $10.57, 11/28/12 (halving): $12.34, 1/1/13: $13.30). Price took off in March/April, lost about 1/2 - 2/3, and finally shot to moon in November/December. 
Bitcoin has only halved once, and that was almost 4 years after creation, when there were fewer exchanges and less visibility. China was taking off in late 2013, and Gox's Willy bot was doing its thing. 
tl;dr Bitcoin halved once, it took several months for any significant gains, and ecosystem around price totally different, so no way to discern a pattern.

Only true if you invested in January 2011. After February 1, price over the level for millionaire status. If you invested $1000 at high point in 2011, you'd have about $22,000 (not a bad investment over five years, but hardly headline grabbing). That's assuming you held. If you bought at high point, and still held at end of year, you would have weathered a loss of 84%. 
That just underscores the stupidity of this article: it is narrowly defining points of reference as likely year start/end. That's convenient for comparison, as other assets do this as well, but Bitcoin is a different creature, being traded 24/7 with no holidays.

Used them for a little while (I usually use Gemini). Note that there can be a delay in a deposit showing up (my deposit had 2 confirmations before it even showed the deposit and 1st confirmation there). Not a big deal, but can be a bit disconcerting for the 20-30 minutes of delay it might take (and if you're trying to move on an alt, may result in a different price point than you were expecting)

There will always be late adopters. Same cycle, over and over.

New classes of crimes become more common since if someone steals your Bitcoin there’s zero recourse. 
Many businesses will start pushing Bitcoin payments to put an end to chargebacks as a form of recourse. 
Governments will throw considerable effort at blockchain analysis in prosecuting crimes. No longer is physical evidence needed once you have an immutable cryptographically secure record. (Only challenge is address linking)

You do realize it was over 1150 earlier this month?
Bitcoin has crashed before, it might crash again. Every single time, before it did, people were saying, "but this time it's different..." People so bad want to speak it into existence, but that's not how the real world works. When we hit 1000.01, within an hour, idiots were saying we had seen the end of triple-digit prices. 
More often than not, big price swings are the result of things we have no control over, and often are unpredicted. Governments taking action, exchanges getting hacked, that sort of thing. 
Just a few scenarios:
* If President Trump learns Bitcoin is a way to get around the remittance controls he wants, and he signs an executive order banning it, price would be $100 tomorrow. 
* Coinbase gets hacked
* Coinbase closes because they won't give the IRS what they want
* Satoshi gets sick of what Bitcoin has become, and decides to kill his creation by moving and dumping all his coins
* Amazon announces it will accept Ethereum, but not Bitcoin, as payment
None of these will likely happen, but I think you get the idea. Markets are cold, heartless, and unpredictable.

Bottom line: every time (been in Bitcoin since 2011) I've seen someone here say we were at the lowest we'd ever be, they were wrong.

Only if miners are currently selling more than 50% of what they produce (which may be true). The supply coming from miners will only be reduced the excess of what they currently sell over 50%. 
If Bitcoin has a daily volume of 1M ( and we assume miners sell 100% of what they mine (they aren't), we'll see daily supply shrink by 1800, or 0.18%.

If you bought via ACH, there's a several day delay before your purchase will be part of your balance. (3-5 business days.. so unless you purchased prior to July 17 it's still in that window)
In my experience it's just as you described: it'll show your purchase, but that won't be credited on your total balance until the payment fully clears.

Buffet's advice has nothing to do with scope. Why would you put money into something with no way to make decision about whether it's going to make money? If you're just hoping or because the loudest voices on Reddit said so, you're not investing, you're speculating. 
I don't think you need a deep understanding of Bitcoin at a technical level; knowing how it moves around and what a private key is would be a good starting point however. (SOOOO many questions on Reddit about these topics)

Answer is always yes. When a drop occurs, you're assuming the funds will be available, but even then, you'll second guess yourself about whether it'll drop more.
At the end of the day, if Bitcoin is a good investment, the exact price you paid won't make much of a difference. If it will to you, another investment might be better.

Depending on where you (and the exchange or vendor) are located, a business selling you Bitcoin is subject to KYC/AML (know your customer/anti-money laundering) laws. Basically those are laws forced by the government to prevent easy transfer of assets in a way that can't be tracked. Obviously everyone has different opinions about these laws, but for now, that's the environment you're working in. I'd say they're likely safe, but obviously there's risk involved. 
If you want to avoid dealing with KYC/AML look into decentralized exchanges, mining your own Bitcoin, or using something like Localbitcoins to buy p2p. Each of course has its disadvantages over exchanges that make the process simple like Coinbase.

Yes, but keep in mind Gemini works a little different from Coinbase in how it displays purchases when you transfer ACH funds. It'll show the balance right away, and you can buy BTC, but you'll have a hold on transferring to your personal wallet until those funds "clear". (about 5 days I believe)

Well, unless you never plan on working, you'll have money in the future you don't have today :-)
For me it's more of a psychological thing: I believe in Bitcoin over the long run, and feel confident that it will rise. I think the regular buys keep you more disciplined. Some of my coins I bought at $1800 (imagine if I had instead gone all in at $3000). But recently I bought at $4400 because it was time to buy :-) Long-term accumulation helps me stay chill I guess :-)

If you calculate the cost of solar (anywhere from around $1500-4000; I estimated $3000) you'll never make your original investment back (with difficulty adjustments, even with free electricity, there comes a time when that miner isn't making any money)
Of course, you would presumably buy new mining equipment and reuse the solar setup in the future. If you ignore the cost of the solar setup then, you make about an 80% ROI before your return zeros out. Going that route (assuming similar mining costs and similar efficiency vs. difficulty), you'd ROI in about 2 1/2 years.

Articles just points out that most volume is wash trading by the exchange. In other words, inorganic trades, so when the market is moving one direction or another, probably more fake volume than actual market sentiment. It has nothing to do with exchanges trying to trick you into selling (since that makes no sense, since there's a buyer on the end of every single transaction; exchanges profit off of fees, and churn is better for them than any given price).

He also paid for a Bitcoin mining setup back in 2011 - I built the rigs and monitored them, he paid for it and we'd split. BTC was about $32 when we started, and dropped to $2. I think around the time it jumped back up to $7, he wanted out.

Most miners will hit an end of useful life between 12-24 months (meaning difficulty means you're making no money each day, even with free electricity, unless you jump to a compatible altcoin), and quite possibly before you ROI on the infrastructure; it'd be a long game of reinvesting in new miners.

Actually, yes. When economists talk about the "strength of the dollar" that's exactly what they're talking about. 
Literally on the front page of Bloomberg right now: [


Miners pay their electric bill in Dollars. (or Euros, or Yuan, etc) Bitcoin doesn't just appear out of thin air. It may feel that way when you buy it on an exchange, but someone, somewhere, spent a currency other than Bitcoin to mine it. 


Pretty sure this is an indication that you don't have any.

You bought a lifetime contract for a given amount of hashpower. Difficulty adjustments are a thing; barring hash rate changing dramatically in the network, any given hash rate will eventually result in negative ROI. Plugging those numbers into the many mining calculators out there would tell you if the amount you would pay for the contract would be less than or greater than your return.
Looking at the difficulty rate and adjustments, some best case scenarios would only generated $2000-3000 in income, which would have been the maximum price you would have paid. Only if the BTC price had averaged around $30k the entire time would your investment had broken even.

When all else fails, move the goalposts.

Sure you can pick a single stock that hasn't done well, but most have beaten your 20%. The Dow is up well over 200% during that time.  Individual stocks like Apple or Google have done even better.

Of course. But just by buying on an exchange, even if you transfer back to your own wallet, you’ve given in a little bit to the government and that exchange will store your PII for as long as regulations require.

When you have coins in an exchange, they are 2 places. They're on the blockchain, but the exchange owns those. They are also stored in the exchange's ledger, and that represents your ownership. So there's a lot of coins out there where the real owner (the customer of the exchange) isn't represented on the blockchain. Until you have the private key, your ownership depends on trust in the exchange. (kinda sounds like fiat, doesn't it?)

Like another article posted here, it is actually doesn't speak in such certainty. The commissioner is saying he is optimistic that someone will be willing to structure the ETF and compromise in order to accomplish the SEC's goal: protecting investors and removing the risk. The means that company will likely have to assume risk, and whether this hurts BTC as a whole, the SEC couldn't care less. The investors in an ETF are all that matters to them. It won't just match the BTC price; lambo boys expecting a lift-off may be very disappointed.

Something monumental will have to happen to get beyond the $300s. The Greek crisis was possibly the best opportunity to highlight the risk of banks and government control, and it didn't take long for the short lived gains to come back down. 
As confirmed by the recent Gox employee AMA, much of 2013's exuberance was the result of manipulation. Right now we're at about the point we were at in spring of 2013. We've been pretty flat since late 2014. 
I'd say 400 around the time of the halving is a good target. Use today's price as your benchmark, not the $1100+ in late 2013.

The title of the article is drawing a different conclusion than what he actually said:
"I think someone will satisfy the standards that we’ve laid out there? I hope so, yes, and I think so."
"Whether or not we’re going to find one that really protects investors I don’t know"
Reading between the lines, he is saying that anything that merely tracks BTC price will be denied. Protecting investors is the key: from the SEC's perspective the success of the issuer and the growth of Bitcoin itself is secondary. This probably requires an ETF to be structured so that risk is passed from the investor to the ETF manager.

If a $20 infrastructure cost is a material concern, you really shouldn't be taking Bitcoin payments. We're not yet at a point where it's a net positive for those who accept it. You'll get plenty of encouragement to accept it, because that grows the ecosystem and enriches holders. However, as a business principal, if you're looking at Bitcoin as a competitive or a profit advantage, we're not there yet. (I'm a developer for a b2b company; we were one of Stripe's first BTC integration users, and in the years that option existed, we never took a single payment in BTC. It was an easy integration, but with no payments, we never ROI'ed)

After a long drop, it's more or less hung out in the mid-200s. Seems to me that the exuberance of 2013, when Gox was pushing volume, and Chinese exchanges were outright lying about volume, has been priced out, and the price in April 2013 got up to 266 (a good reference point since that was before things blew up in China, though Gox's voodoo may have been involved at that point). Despite some movement based on tangential events (like Greek crisis, launch of Coinbase exchange, or short-term Dow losses) it's pretty stable at this point, so I think it's based on reality now.

Only keep coins on an exchange you need to immediately trade. (edit: added immediate trade part .. was typing too fast earlier!) If you don't know how to manage your own wallet, learn. Preferably you should buy a hardware wallet, like a Trezor or Ledger. (if the ship date is several weeks away, Trezor will let you jump to the front for $15 - I've ordered two and received both in days, from Europe to US)
If things get more suspicious, and Bitfinex makes it hard to move funds in/out, you may see prices skyrocket there. Ignore the urge to try to profit off of that. Mt. Gox, until near the end, was trading at a serious premium (about $100, which was a significant difference then). You couldn't withdraw fiat, but you could transfer BTC out. It was obvious what was going on, but so many kept their coins there thinking they'd enable withdrawals and make that profit. That's why today I have little sympathy for those who were Goxed: the emergency exit was in front of them, but they stayed out of greed.

You can be your own bank; you have the ability to store any amount of money in an address, and move those coins in and out without ever involving a third party. Of course, in reality, many use exchanges as a bank ....
It's worth noting that the initial Bitcoin block contained this message: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks." One could say that it's in Bitcoin's DNA to be the anti-bank.

Oh noes! How will the market cope with having only 99.625% of the previous supply!

Why can't Bitcoin? Amazon and eBay transactions settle over the course of a business day.

I may have unclear, but I did point that out. ("Article says those who spend with Bitcoin spend more...") I meant, as a percentage of sales, how does their Bitcoin volume rank? To say that 46% of all Bitcoin orders are new customers sounds good, but is pretty meaningless without comparison to the same statistic for traditional sales.

The problem you'll run into is the user agreement dictates liability for chargebacks or breaching the user agreement. 


In addition to whether it's treated as a chargeback, selling currency is against their rules or at the very least requires pre-approval. I don't think having the sales receipt would protect you in that instance.
However, perhaps being in another country MAY give you some protection from seizure. If the amount is material to you, I'd consult a local legal expert though.

Likewise, I've been in Bitcoin since 2011. Something everyone seems to gloss over - every new high has been followed by a 70% or higher drop.

Then a new cycle will begin anew to provide us with the next set of victims, as the last set now proclaim themselves oracles.

No, I don't think you understand forks. A fork is a copy, not cutting the original in 2. It's typically not worth $2, but it's generally worth more than $1. In the Bitcoin Cash fork, Bitcoin actually shot up, and Bitcoin cash was worth between around 0.05 and 0.20 Bitcoins each at varying times.

I wasn't sure whether to read this is Donald Trump's voice or Craig Wright's. 
As for the rest of your emotional rant, you just seem to be doubling down on your incorrect statements and upset that people won't accept what you say as true. (Are you sure you're not Donald Trump or Craig Wright?) Guess what? This is Bitcoin. A trustless protocol. The proof is in the work. If you utter statements that are incorrect, you can't scream "But I'm a programmer guys! I have the smarts!" and be accepted more. You stated several untruths about the protocol, and now you're trying to weasel out and say you were really trying to say something else. Let's stick with one statement:


Absolutely wrong. Anyone who has been in cryptocurrency, let alone someone who's been to multiple to cryptocurrency schools (lol) knows that price and hashrate aren't connected; just take 5 seconds and look at hashrate vs. price and you'll see the disconnect.

I'd say buy as much as you could stomach losing 20% of your value for 90-180 days. The price trends upward over time, but is often depressed over the short term. 
For most people, buying in over time makes the most sense for their cash flow and sanity. 
I'd base your decisions on a long-term view, not idea that Bitcoin will increase to $2000 this year.

Keep in mind that it's possible to mine at a loss: it's a way of converting funds (in the form of equipment and expenses) into another (cryptocurrency) that can be easily transferred.

Has occurred before, when price was much much lower and it had no effect. 


Good to see a big company finally accept Bitcoin, unless those tiny ones like Microsoft and Dell. 


See some of my other comments in other threads - those are the investment dollars we don't want, because those dollars will bail fast when price goes wrong direction. 


These are the reasons Bitcoin will rise. Nothing Bitcoin, or companies in the ecosystem can do, will ever have a fraction of the impact as the externalities. That of course means that when the situation changes, so does the effect it has on Bitcoin.

Spoiler: you'll start to lose money in 5 months given normal electricity costs, after making back less than 1/3 of your investment. As for using solar panels, I presume that panels that deliver enough voltage would be several hundreds of dollars. Even if the electricity is free, your return would be pretty slim, starting at less than $100 a month per miner and then dropping to less than $10 a month after about 18 months. Remember that due to difficulty increases, your equipment will always have a decreasing return, until the point it's all but useless.

Yes, but it was a quote from the developer on a podcast. I think going in assuming that what you're doing is out in the open is the best approach for them. Develop OpenBazaar with assumption that 1) the lettered-organizations know what you're doing and 2) some dumb fuckers will use it to procure crack via Fedex. With those assumptions in place, you build in the safe-guards to ensure that as a developer (since they're not running the marketplace), you aren't exposed to liability.

In the US many criminals do carry guns, and they don't respect your life. 
I don't think it's a matter of political will, but of military might. To disarm impoverished criminal communities would make Ferguson look like a children's cartoon. (most gun deaths aren't committed by the Rambo character you've envisioned)
Most Americans don't have the Rambo fantasy. They're terrified of the possibility of what can happen to them or their family, and owning a legal gun makes them sleep a little better. 


about 60% of firearm deaths are suicides; about 34% are homicides. About 1/2 of all homicides in the US are committed by minorities; most of those are committed by other minorities. (about 75% of gun deaths among white are suicides, compared to about 15% among non-whites)

Ignore the price at Bitfinex. Yes, that means you'll lose some value when you move to another exchange.
Do not ignore history. A few months before Mt. Gox went belly-up, they had the same situation: you couldn't withdraw fiat, you could move Bitcoin, and the price was at a significant premium to other exchanges as a result. I'm not saying Bitfinex will have the same result, but many kept their money in Gox when they could have easily moved their coins. Why? Greed, because they wanted to believe they'd realize that premium price. To this day I have very little sympathy for those who were Goxxed as a result.

Programming against Bitcoin itself is far more complex than just pulling data from an exchange's API.
Most APIs are REST JSON. To this end, there's nothing specific about Bitcoin exchanges. It depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Are you building a website? As for tutorials, look up "(php/ruby/whatever language you're using) display REST API data" or something like that.

I agree with you about crazy loud minds. I think Kim gets a lot more credit than he's due however. Looking at his history, he's quite the fraudster. 
His claim to fame is creating a sharing site, that paid his sharers via ad shares and encouraged "popular" uploads. He was taken down by the US (I'll agree illegally). Somehow that turned him from a fraud into some major patriot for Internet freedom. He let you download free Marvel movies, and now he's our hero that runs on pure genius and innovation. (not even getting into his actual criminal convictions on separate occasions, which is well documented) 
Perhaps this is true, and he'll make the protocol more useful. There's also a lot hopium smoking in the Bitcoin space that has enabled the Josh Garzas and the Butterfly Labs. Aside from just blind faith, he's done little to convince me.

I'd look at it a different way: too many Bitcoin holders don't worry about security until it's too late, and there's too much on the line. Ideally one day you'll be doing better than today, so why not take the  time now to learn how to secure when the stakes are low?

Personally I think the rise in early 2017 and subsequent fall (based on ETF anticipation) and later spike based on event that wasn't catastrophic (BCH fork; in 2013 it was US Senate action) means 2017 was 2013. Obviously 2014 had Gox failure, but Tether/Bitfinex situation is looking kinda sketchy...

Others have pointed out Tether, but keep in mind that the SEC is going to start going in raw on all these ICOs. Many ICOs were indirectly funded with BTC (BTC -&gt; ETH -&gt; ERC20 tokens), and in general, the public at large won't draw a distinction between BTC and the "cryptocurrency being prosecuted by the SEC" (I promise news anchors will dumb it down as much as possible) So no more 2017-level growth for a while, and public confidence will be shot to hell.

Of course transaction count isn't the same as engagement.

If you never transact outside of Coinbase, it's not really cryptocurrency. None of the features that make it cryptocurrency are present. You never own any cryptocurrency; you can't find your transaction on a blockchain. You have done nothing but use fiat to buy an entry on Coinbase's database.

Yet we celebrate the idiot who took out a second mortgage to go all in on BTC. Whether or not you "win" isn't what determines whether something is "foolish" or not. If you're a pro, taking an $85k calculated risk isn't foolish, because you likely take many risks in your career, and your overall success is what matters. If this was a one time moonshot, then it of course was foolish.

I don't disagree that Kraken is pulling some sketchy shit. I just presume the damages in a suit would be limited to the material loss caused by what they are suggesting. (Price reduction due to fees and the market while the coins are in transit, for example)

As total mining increases/decreases, the algorithm adjusts to try to keep block generation at 10 minutes. As price dropped, many miners went dark (or switched to other coins), causing the difficulty to adjust down. If difficulty goes up, that means mining is increasing.

It's probably not boring to those who lost money there. Bank robberies are insured, Mt. Gox was not, so it's more than a stain. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:53:19
Not sure about that exact amount, but in 2011, it lost 90+%. So a comparable loss could take us down to around $500. 
What could cause it?
* increased regulation, particularly in US or Europe. Imagine if ACH transactions from Bitcoin exchanges were declared illegal. 
* another major hack (say, Coinbase)
* a major bug in the protocol discovered
* massive dumping (say Satoshi says "fuck it, I've had it with my creation", announces his sale and starts doing it)
* some new crypto becomes massively profitable to mine
Obviously we could come up with a bullet list that is just as unlikely but on the flip-size, resulting in massive gains. We could also come up with similar lists for stocks or fiat. The point is no matter how many honeybadger memes you see, Bitcoin the exchanged currency could lose massive value given the right set of circumstances.
(usual retort is to talk about the technology behind Bitcoin being unstoppable, but there's a big difference between the technology that is Bitcoin, and the intersection of fiat and BTC in the exchanges that allows it to have a value)

There is no "community". Bitcoin is too big for that. After all, there's no "Visa community", "PayPal community", "US Dollar community" etc. With any heterogenous group, there will be different desires, some of which conflict. (ie, profit, freedom, anonymity, etc)

Biggest difference is that in the midst of a bear market, the largest Bitcoin exchange (Mt. Gox) declared bankruptcy, taking a lot of Bitcoin with it. There's a lot more diversity in the market now, though I think if Coinbase had a catastrophic event (unlikely, despite what we may think about their support) it could happen again.


In 2014 it got close to $300; it went below $200 in 2015.

The article is desperate to compare Bitcoin to Facebook, except that Facebook's stock "crashed" over the past couple of days due to the Cambridge Analytics scandal (not even mentioned in this article). And no, Bitcoin hasn't outperformed Facebook over the past 3 months. (Facebook is down around 8% during that time period; Bitcoin, over 50%) Why isn't the article comparing Bitcoin to other tech stocks? Or did the so-called journalist pick the worst possible tech company to compare it to? The article says "all the other stocks" but only compares it to Facebook. 
I mean, I want to see Bitcoin succeed, and am excited by the price over the past couple of days, but worthless strawman writing like this does no one any favor. Look for better articles op - not cheap Wordpress sites with cheap themes ( with domains bought last Friday (seriously - just checkout the WHOIS)

If it's in response to news, it's usually a dip. Correction is usually built-up pressure (responding vs reacting, if you will)

The shipping carriers won't do that. You could use already existing tracking to verify delivery however.

Most third-party libraries for payments set price at a point in time, and consumer has a short period of time (like 5 minutes) to send. Similarly, systems like Stripe that process Bitcoin payments only process refunds etc in fiat, to prevent flood of refund requests when BTC price goes up.

Best way to do it. Make sure you commit to it, otherwise when it's time to buy, you'll doubt yourself and wait, thinking you'll get a better deal tomorrow.

Not sure what you're trying to say here. Both BTC and BCH are open source projects, with a set of developers who have a commit bit and make decisions on what pull requests are and aren't included.

Looking at the screenshot, it says "Administrator disabled 2FA" from an IP address I assume is Bitstamp. (though perhaps you're correct and that's just a manual step Bitstamp performs)
Regardless, you are correct that SMS 2FA is bad, and a TOTP solution like Authy or Google Authenticator is the way to go. Even better would be u2f, but I believe only Bitfinex supports that (not that Bitfinex should be considered the standard-bearer of security)

To be clear, I don't think there's a ton of FUD, as much as I'm communicating to those who do. What others call FUD, I call potentially inaccurate news (for instance, "$COUNTRY banning Bitcoin exchanges"). Price goes down, people cry, "FUD!!! Not fair!". And that's my point: if the price can be played so easily, it's not mature. 
To directly answer your question, no, I'd qualify FUD as less than credible news, not legit criticism.

Pretty obvious they haven't stolen anything. 
Coinbase hasn't released BCH either. Moreover, when Coinbase released ETC from ETH, they did so several months after it was released (well after the initial pump and drop), only support withdrawals, not trading, and closed withdrawals after several weeks. 
You knew to withdraw prior to August 1 if you wanted to claim your BCH.

2 months ago the price was already over $4000. $5000 meant a 25% rise over 4 months for a coin that had risen 400% over 8. 
What has shot the price up this year? A number of events: 
* anticipated ETF 
* Bitcoin Cash fork
* Bitcoin Gold and s2x forks
* BTC bought to buy ETH for ICOs
For the price to rise another 3.5x from here by the end of next year, what events are on the horizon?

It was hard to buy Bitcoin in 2009, since there weren't any exchanges at the time :-) That said, a $500 video card in 2009 would probably have the same effect if you mined however
But assume you bought some Bitcoin at $0.10 or whatever .. how many would have sold at $1100 in 2013? Or freaked out and sold at $700 in 2014? Or even gotten past the 90%+ drop in 2011/2012?

Bitcoin is still fairly young. Imagine the web in 2000. (8 years after its birth, same place as Bitcoin today) While most people could connect reasonably inexpensively, wifi wasn't common, mobile Internet really didn't exist, and popup malware was rampant. 
If you don't have some degree of a clue, you'll be another person crying about how they got hacked/scammed. In a few years it'll be better.

After previous ATH, you heard alot of the same thing: "I know it's down but up year over year!!".

If you have a crystal ball, then always go for the guaranteed best outcome. However, if you look at what's gotten us to where we're at in 2017, you can't assume those events will happen in the future.

It may, that's not the point. Bitcoin needs infrastructure to operate the network, and a failed USD will take a ton of infrastructure down with it.

Different motivation. Whales were trying to drive price down to buy on the cheap; banks, if the fantasies about Bitcoin are true, are willing to lose money because supposedly they'll avoid the devastating effects in the future.
There are surely actors who could destroy many Bitcoin investors at will, if only they chose to. Let's take a Buffet, who acquires coins over time, putting a few hundred million into it. Then one day, they put them all on the market for $10 each. Likely wouldn't happen, but a Buffet could do it and it really wouldn't hurt them much, while there's a number of companies and investors who would get their anuses completely ripped open before the market right-sided. $5B is really nothing, and imagine if a state actor did something similar. The US spends over $555B a year on the military - what could a skunkworks project do to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:18:54
You don't know they haven't, other than trusting them. By leaving your coins on the exchange instead of in your wallet, you are implicitly trusting them, since you are refusing to take possession of your property.

"The US can't sanction you"
Unfortunately, BTC is still just a proxy for fiat. The US (and China, and others) can issue policies that wouldn't sanction your BTC, but reduce the value (image if the US declared ACH transfers to/from crypto currencies illegal, for example). Even if you are "your own bank", even if you have no holdings in an exchange, even if they reverse the decision eventually: the market will respond, your BTC will lose value, and you'll have no recourse other than hoping the market recovers.
@_date: 2015-04-26 16:47:39

My point is that just as criminals operate outside of the paper trail now, they'll operate outside of a perfectly transparent blockchain. 
If I have a balance 100X times the typical citizen, and everyone knows, that makes me a target for a ton of crime that would never show up on the blockchain. Presumably I have a lot of stuff if I have a lot of coin, stuff that can be taken and entered into the inevitable barter economy. 
Let's get away from crime even. A privacy-minded group could create a single account with a one-time pooling of coins. They then start up a private blockchain denominated at the level of their coop. 
I can't see how you'd enforce the transparent blockchain, preventing off-chain transactions, without a very heavy hand.


Maybe of the government. Maybe of big business. Not of themselves. This would include the amount of money you spend on alcohol, your porn purchases, your visit to the ob/gyn, your visit to the HIV specialist.

(prepare your downvotes)
There were plenty of cars in 1948. Hell, the price was down from 1948 until about 1972, as the supply of cars kept going up. Only in 1972, when there was a pricing crisis, and afterwards, the heavy hand of OPEC forced prices up.

* Bitcoin will be low for a while
* "Adoption = price gain" is bullshit
* the only way it can go up is if some centralized force controls it, at opposed to the market pricing it purely on merit

What's your cash flow model like? Keep in mind that Bitcoin can often swing 5%-10% over a day or 2. (sometimes in your advantage, sometimes you lose value) If you're using a merchant that immediately cashes you out, that wouldn't be an issue, but if you plan on holding for any period of time, that might be important.
Additionally, who's your target market? Do you feel like your product is an impulse buy? If it is, I don't know if Bitcoin is a good fit. 
Personally, I'd do both; merchant providers like Stripe and Braintree allow this, and also easily facilitate paying your talent.

No - I'm not trying to win a silly argument via definitions, I'm still talking about industry inception to mass adoption, which was the original discussion. Inception was the "personal computer", and mass adoption was software that anyone could use (arguably the Macintosh, but for whatever reason, didn't really take off until Windows 3)
If Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is to succeed as everyone argues, it's as significant as the personal computer, and that industry makes for a good example. Like that industry, or even the oft-cited example of the Internet, the first implementation may not be the winning implementation - only through iteration does true mass adoption occur.

Glancing at the whitepaper, it seems to gloss over the technical details: 


technology with double-encrypted tamper-proof file integrating natively a process

- "double-encrypted": what algorithms?
- "tamper-proof": again, what algorithm? (other than the "just trust me I'm a patriot because the US unfairly raided my piracy operation" algorithm)
The paper does specify the two layers are client and server-side, with a unique key per file, but doesn't really get into key storage, etc.


its transactions and its internal functionalities. Although the Blockchain will be private, K.im
Payment will take advantage of Blockchain’s distributed nature and use multiple private nodes

You'll be paying a fair amount in electricity each month - miners require a lot of power.
Mining by design gets less efficient over time. Bitcoin's difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks ( and almost always goes up. So at first you're making a reasonable amount (about $40 a week), but that amount goes down. Eventually the value is smaller than what you're paying in electricity, at which point, your miners are worthless and should be turned off. (and sold to a sucker lol)
Obviously this is variable based on difficulty adjustments, your electricity cost, and how much Bitcoin is selling for. You can plug the numbers in yourself here: 
(for reference, the s9 currently being sold is 11.5TH/s, and about 1250W)

The world's wealth is several multiples of gold. Everything is highly leveraged, and debt can be reissued several times over when it doesn't default (and often even that doesn't matter).

Put a different way, mid-February 2013 the price of Bitcoin was about $26, about 1/13 of the current price. So you wouldn't say the price was tiny then?

No. You should buy Bitcoin with that money. To mine successfully, you have to do it at industrial scale. The best miner you can buy will break even in about 15-18 months, and shortly thereafter, you'll start to lose money. Bitcoin tends to rise over time (about 6x in that same 18 month time period where you'd barely break even), so it's always more profitable to just buy the currency directly instead of spending money to mine it. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:34:33
You spent a lot of time explaining away a potential hack, and I personally think on the list of potential disasters that could cause Bitcoin to lose its value, there are many more likely scenarios than a hack.

I didn't say that. I'm just pointing out that you're wrong that this rise is only a week long.
However, I don't think time and cap matters. I've been around since $32 deflated to $2, and the bubbles/corrections in-between. Bubbles are fueled by hype and FOMO; whether that applies here remains to be seen.

Not really possible. The exchange doesn't cash you out, but you sell your asset to another user, and you then have a fiat balance that you can transfer out. (Obviously this assumes a solvent exchange, whose assets on the books match the assets in the bank)

* pool of empty gift cards
* pool of purchased gift cards with values
* they receive $20 in Bitcoin
* sweep $25 to one of those empty gift cards
* present user with card number/barcode
So you're not actually paying with Bitcoin, but with a legit gift card. However, I think it's a matter of policy, not the legitimacy of it that is the question.

The desktop is losing relevance every year, and Linux is the undeniable winner in mobile. (though iOS wins by profit margins)
Let's think about it though - Linux was the anti-Windows. Linux's real victory came by way of corporate sponsorship (through the years via IBM et al, and broad acceptance via Google). Its application looks nothing like it did in 1996, and if you had told the die-hard Linux geeks then that most people wouldn't be updating config files, tweaking drivers, or have the ability to swap out windowing environments, they'd probably puke on you. But that's what we have with Android, embedded devices, and Chromebooks.
Bitcoin is the anti-bank. Its real adoption comes not from someone taking it for artisanal Bohemian sandwiches, but from the VCs with big money. In 20 years, will our little libertarian wet dreams be looked upon quaintly, with adoption that looks nothing like what we think it will today?

I think you're confusing hacks with performance. When volume is high, due to its popularity, Coinbase tends to be a bit slow (or even occasional moments of downtime). 
This is different than their security. I've heard nothing regarding Coinbase's security vulnerability as you've described. Given their experience and resources I'd estimate they have as good or better security than most every other exchange.

There is a group here that seem to be driven by blind faith, with logic that is nothing short of religion. The flip side is that the hate is its own religion. I'm a bit of a contrarian, but mostly support Bitcoin. However, I've  had discussions on here where the other party was so drunk with wanting to call me a "butter" and spew obscenities that they were pretty much incapable of even countering my points with anything resembling logic.
It's like someone with a hard-on for being against Christianity that all they can do is repeat the same talking points over and over, or likewise for Liberals vs. Republicans.

Yes, I think a tablet per PoS would work. However, for most retailers, I'm unsure that zero-confirmation would be acceptable, and obviously quick confirmation is an issue that may make retail use a poor use case for a while.
WalMart already has their own proprietary settlement layer - I suspect they would allow you to load Bitcoin into it, as opposed to on-the-fly payments using the Bitcoin protocol.

That's decent ROI, but even to have a comfortable retirement, you need at least $2-3M in the bank. I think the idea is that Bitcoin won't replace fiat-based investments anytime soon, if ever.

It's direct currency conversion into something less traceable. Coinbase knows AML laws are a very real concern, so they're paranoid. They're essentially saying don't do that shit in front of us. Besides, Bitcoin by design makes it too easy to transfer out your coins and do it any N steps removed from Coinbase, so why would you do it from an account that you just had to bend over backwards for verification? Should be obvious it's big brother. (like most exchanges)

I don't believe the FUD about Coinbase, but your logic here isn't sound. Many startups are near bankruptcy when they take additional rounds. VC is an endorsement of promise, and VCs know they need to be in the game to hit a home run, and factor in a certain % of failures.

Cloud mining is always a scam. There's no reason for someone to charge you less to print money than the money is worth.
Even if it's legit, you never break even - the numbers they give you are based on *today*, and once you factor in difficulty increases, you lose money over the long run. Compare that with buying Bitcoin, which has an immediate break-even. 
The hope is always that you'll make more over the long run. However, plug the numbers into any Bitcoin mining calculator. At a conservative average difficulty increase (10%), after 18 months, you still haven't broken even. If you're generous (5%) then you've made back a whopping 15% of profit. (and the daily profit will be getting smaller with each difficulty increase)  This assumes the mining company will be around in 18 months.

A bubble can be a 33% jump over a short period of time. If that's the case, that means we're in one now. I doubt we'll ever see a 10x rise like we did in a few weeks like in 2013. 
Bubbles tend to result from news and hype, not anticipation.
The reason I think people wouldn't consider this time period a bubble is that I feel that a higher % are holding at a loss than in the past "bubbles". When the price rises a good %, it really doesn't matter that you bought at $700 or $600 or $900. You can only judge it based on when it started rising.

Yes, but not the epic income you might think. Each $1200 s9 miner will start off at about $250/mo, breaking even in about 5, and declining to about $10/mo in 3 years. Overall, you'd get about $2000 in profit for each $1200 miner. (assuming 4% difficulty adjustment and same bitcoin price) So your $50k could turn into about $80k, but that's not a straight investment, but an investment of your time and effort. (Running 40+ miners probably also requires an investment of space and cooling, even if the electricity is still free)

Adding additional hardware just increases things linearly (revenue and costs), it doesn't really change your ROI. It does add additional complexity (can your current breaker handle the load? will you need to purchase additional cooling for your home? etc)

It sounds like you want to build a settlement layer atop of the Bitcoin network. As I understand you want to create an easier on-ramp to Bitcoin, via cards that people already understand? I think it'd be better to teach your customers to use Bitcoin, not your bitcards. While I get that you're intention is to increase usage, I think you'd (unintentionally) end up making a walled garden, which is worse than the current banking system.

How are the 2 related? It's not just a matter of transferring funds; it's a mater of doing it in a manner that launders funds. The Silk Road sales were very documented. 
Additionally, LR was all about transferring real dollars. Satoshi created a cryptocurrency, and only later was it traded on an open market for real dollars, which isn't something that Satoshi created. 
So the US wouldn't prosecute for creating Bitcoin, but the fact that they sold seized SR coins has nothing to do with it.

Yes, there will always be those holding. My supposition is that if Bitcoin attains true utility, the % of coins being held will become smaller over time (after all, every day there's more coins than the day before, and it's unlikely that behavior remains static)

For quite a while, virtually nothing had held the price up. A few events here and there: PayPal "announcement", Coinbase launching exchange, Greek crisis, etc, have bumped price, only to quickly lose gains. Halvening? Bitcoin's prior halvening didn't move much quickly; later bull runs far enough away that unlikely that contributed. So no, I'm not sure what could cause the price to rise 62% over the next year.

Possibly. This is an important issue: how Bitcoin supports more transactions. These are issues we've been debating for years. Truth is, while Bitcoin is seen by many as a great way to get rich, there's a lot of technical flux and innovation occurring. Some things may happen along the way to cause people to "lose" money (fiat), but Bitcoin is arguably far more important than investors/speculators. Bitcoin represents way more than its price.

I think the time will come (or it has and we just don't know it) when these relatively small ASIC companies would get obliterated by a serious player (an Intel, or an AMD) and their scale of operations changes the economics. (though I can also see a big player signing an exclusivity agreement, or those companies operating their own mining operations)
I mean seriously, when in the history of humanity have we ever legally had the ability to create pure money-making machines. Other than the time value of money, are ASIC producers (or at least those who can produce at scale) truly incentivized to give up the goods. 
Could a Bill Gates, or a US Government, or a Chinese billionaire, bring online 5000TH? How inexpensively? (considering no sales channel needed: they're keeping the money for themselves) They'd dramatically out-profit small players, and I doubt anyone could stop them, and it'd be business as usual: rich getting richer, using the unfair advantage of resources. 
tl;dr If it becomes too profitable to ignore, Bitcoin mining will become a business of those with resources to scale quickly

I won't address the legality or ethics of it, there's been tons written about that.

I assume you're here because of the price rise, and are interested? 
For most in that situation, the easiest way is Coinbase. You'll have to verify alot of personal information due to regulations, and it'll take a few days for you to purchase, and a few more days to have the Bitcoins available. 
You'll probably hear alot of discussion about better purchasing options (they exist), that you should hold the Bitcoins yourself instead of keeping them in Coinbase (true), that you should get a dedicated hardware wallet for storing your Bitcoins (also true), etc. 
Personally, for the newb, unless you're willing to take time to research these things before making your first purchase, Coinbase is a safe bet. Buy your Bitcoin, hopefully it'll rise, and while it does, you can learn more. Education is critical in Bitcoin, because if you mess up (lose your private key, transfer coins to the wrong address, etc) there's no safety net to protect you. Once you lose a Bitcoin, it's gone.

Plug the numbers into any Bitcoin calculator. Ignoring the halving, at the average difficulty increase over the past 12 months (5.2%), you'll break even in 6 months, and get to about 75% ROI in a year and half, and at that point it'll essentially be zero increases in ROI.
But the halving is a thing. Plugging those same numbers in: you never break even. 
But what if Bitcoin's price increases? Well, then in every situation, you'll always come out ahead by buying the Bitcoin yourself.
And this all assumes that you believe cloud mining is real. Why would someone sell/lease you a cash machine? In every situation they make more money by not selling to you. 
Just because you're seeing payouts doesn't mean anything. You're looking a screen on a website, not the actual mining. I could build a Rails app in a few hours that did the same thing, and simulating the numbers that mining supposedly produces would be simple.

If you wish to have access to the BCC, yes. If Blockchain.info hasn't explicitly said they will allow you to withdraw your BCC separately, that wouldn't be a good solution. 
Best solution: hardware wallet. Of course, too late for that. Failing that, you should get a wallet on your computer/phone. 
If you don't care about BCC, then just leave it on Coinbase. Keep in mind that after August 1, this isn't a reversible decision.

I'm very familiar with Bitcoin's price history. I've been there through the highs since $32, watched the circle jerk each time, the silly little suicide hotline posts, the memes each time. Watched folks pump out there chest and proclaim the impenetrable floor because of circular logic ("it'll stay high because it's high!") and be proven wrong over and over over. The claims of "but this time it's different!"
This year alone we've broken the ATH, then dropped below $1000 before coming back. I'm pretty sure we'll stay above $1600 for a while, but there is nothing preventing a drop below whatever imaginary numbers we come up with, no matter how big a hit of hopium we have. In the bear markets (and usually in the bulls) it becomes more obvious how fickle the market is and how easily it is controlled by external factors we have no control over, and no ability to predict.

You have to manually wire money around using the banking system. Perhaps we could use Western Union, but generally speaking, your point of failure (and detection) is when you necessarily need to inject fiat into the system. Trust me, those transactions are very far from anonymous, and the banking system is very cooperative with the powers that be.

There has been pressure on them to get a proper audit for a while now. What is pushing them to do it now, instead of last year in the wake of their hack? I suspect the fiat withdrawal issue may take many more weeks and possibly months to resolve. It's entirely possible that they agreed to an audit now, instead of last year, because now they need to buy a little time to keep their business from totally imploding as everyone moves their Bitcoin elsewhere. Hopefully this will buy them some credibility, at least until June 30.

(and yes, before someone flaunts that they actually took notes in their high school business class, I do know it's called "dollar cost averaging") It's great that it's on auto-pilot, but I'll admit that I get lazy about transferring out of Coinbase's control, which anyone should definitely do.

It's happened like this before, so in Bitcoin it's not abnormal. We've had bubbles, we've had pops. Over time the price has trended upward. If this is a bubble, and it pops, I think we'll see the same, over some amount of time. 
However, I think there's a lot of value in what you say, as in the past, there are plenty who are convinced the new world order is here to stay, that they can mortgage their house and future and put it all in Bitcoin, etc. The next major drop we see will result in a lot of people getting burned, who didn't/refused to learn from the past.

For several months while fiat withdrawals were blocked you could have transferred your hard-earned coins to your own wallet (or another exchange). However, Gox was trading at a premium to other exchanges, and many holders there probably thought they could realize the premium (which they'd lose by transferring out). I'm no defender of MK or Mt. Gox, but there's zero sympathy when the exchange was a shit show for fiat withdrawals, and all anyone had to do was turn the knob on the exit door. 
(everyone tends to point out that Bitcoin withdrawals was blocked too, but that was only at the very end when it was too late)
Let's hope for a different outcome with Bitfinex. I'll have the same level of sympathy for those holders if it goes badly however.

Due to volatility, Bitcoin really isn't where you want to be if you don't have a long term view. 
That said, I'm not a member of the Cult of HODL. The cult says someone's held coins are more valuable than fresh coins. I've been able to jump in and out of Ethereum and fiat at times and increase the number of Bitcoins I own without spending an extra penny.

I agree, though there was a legitimate thought about money moving rapidly from your everyday person, given the precedence of capital controls that just happened. The reason it didn't happen was either most people don't have Bitcoin on their radar, or fear capital controls less than they fear Bitcoin's volatility.
Which begs the question, how will Wall Street respond? Personally I think that while it appears insane to the lay person, there are some very rational decisions being made when real money is at stake. I don't think "pure speculation" would be qualified as rational.

API key is like a password to use the backend of some software. (API=Application Programming Interface)
Private key is a secret used to "encrypt" (and in some cases, decrypt) some information (for instance, transactions on a blockchain).

Remember that you can "spend" Bitcoin on fiat. Like anything with a purpose, there may be value in waiting to use it for that purpose (for instance, wine)
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:28:11
Risk minimization. 
Generally speaking, you can get coins back into an exchange in about 20 minutes. Keep a second exchange on the ready (meaning you've verified etc). The next time a BTC-e shutdown/Bitfinex hack/Coinbase load issue occurs, you're not trapped and you control your funds; that's the point of Bitcoin. 
As for fiat, to be ready to make purchases when there's a dip, that's another story altogether, since it takes days to get funds in place. Fortunately, Gemini (and perhaps others) will let you initiate and execute a purchase, and simply hold the Bitcoin until your ACH clears.
It's easy to dismiss the risk until something bad happens. This isn't fear mongering, it's experience - we've seen this happen several times over the years. And every time, there's posts on here crying about not having access to their money. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:11:28
There may be a large amount of folks that instead of transferring out will cash out, worried that BCH/BCC could take value out of BTC. (or they missed windows to transfer Bitcoin, due to delays like you see on Coinbase, so they'd prefer to sit out the drama in fiat) This may cause a spike in selling activity, depressing price for a bit.

The problem is that most conversations about Bitcoin leave the realm of technology pretty fast, and turns into a talk about politics and economics at best, though it's usually more of a circle-jerk with the tone of 14 year olds.

You have to embrace the idea that Bitcoin isn't mature, it's still early. Ransomware, exchange hacks, exchanges that you can't get your money out of without using a second exchange... and it always feels like there's another news story about to pop up. Give it time. We're not mainstream yet.

Funny enough, this is an accurate description of 2017. From the low to the high, price almost 100x'ed in 2013; from the beginning to the end of the year, it's a more "modest" 54x. By today (July 22) it was up 8x. So 2017's less than 3x gain definitely pales in comparison.

Previous halvening was on 11/28/12. Price on 11/1: 10.70. Price on 11/27: 12.00. Price on 11/29: 12.15. Price on 12/31: 13.28. 
Price began steady rise at beginning of beginning of 2013, but probably not because of halvening, and if it was, it took several months to feel the effect. So no, you're not getting rich in 41 weeks. If history's an indicator, maybe in about 91.

Yet somehow people try to draw out analogies from gold (or other much larger markets) and apply them to Bitcoin. Sometimes size matters, sometimes in a smaller market there are important lessons. 
I think we see time and time again that when something HUGE happens in the Bitcoin world, it's supposed to shoot the price up, but the reality is that by the time the event has rolled around, the market expectations have already been priced in. The recent LTC halvening represents the closest example we have.

That said, you're dependent on that exchange rate. No one sells anything purely for Bitcoin, but rather, they convert the price. Any action from banks, good or bad, that affects the exchange rate will affect you.

I'm sure you have best of intentions, but worth saying to OP: you should never sell to someone who pays with Paypal. It's possible for them to file a claim and get their money back (and it then comes out of seller's account), even though there's no way to get the Bitcoin back.

Most Bitcoin is traded on exchanges that rely on the banking system. Bitsquare relies on moving money using the banking system. Many trades on Localbitcoin rely on bank deposits/Paypal/etc. The bulk of Bitcoin's trades comes from that system. It's not just a meter, it's how the price is set, for everyone. Take away those options, and the few ways you can trade Bitcoin will result in a coin worth $0.21.

It was, but it wasn't really a singular event. They had blocked fiat withdrawals for several months at that point, but you could get your Bitcoin out until the very end. What made it significant were greedy dumbasses: due to fiat issues, it was trading at about $100 premium. So everyone in Gox, even though the fucking exit door was right there (just withdraw your Bitcoin), stayed in because they fantasized that the premium rate could magically be realized. In other words, nothing about Gox's bankruptcy should have been a surprise, but due to all the money that stayed in, it had a serious effect.

That's part of the point however. We can talk about what should be, or we can talk about what is.

Maybe one day that'll go away, but we're years away from a time when that happens. Meanwhile, BTC-e has for years flaunting ignoring that reality as a feature. 
In other words: The government is wrong for thieving, but BTC-e was voted "most likely to be thieved by the government"

When there's no block awards, miners will only be incentivized to process transactions that have a large enough fee attached. The other side of that coin will see their transactions slowing down as miners are disincentivized, and will start adding fees accordingly out of rational self-interest. In theory the fee marketplace would be self-organizing.
(Fee marketplace will likely emerge well before then, as rewards get smaller or block sizes make transaction processing scarce)

Can you verify it via transaction ID on the blockchain? Otherwise it's just an entry in a database, an IOU. That's an easy Ruby or PHP app: take in lease money, return back amount to reflect what that hashrate would typically return, and keep it up as long as you have new money flowing in, and keep it until ~~it's time to exit~~ you get "hacked". No mining rigs necessary.
If you found a legit operation, that's great, but I really don't think they exist. After all, if it's legit, they've already made the capital investment, and it's impossible to make more profit leasing than keeping what's mined.

Mining IS Bitcoin. Simply put, when you conduct a transaction, you're putting an encrypted message out for those on the Bitcoin network to verify. This requires powerful computers to do the work. In exchange, the miners get a fee, and every 10 minutes or so, someone gets a block of Bitcoin. (currently 12.5 Bitcoins, to reduce by 1/2 every 4 years or so)
It's too late to mine (realistically - you can buy miners, but it's hard to make your money back if you're not a larger operation), but you can purchase Bitcoin if you feel it's valuable as a speculative investment or you want to spend it to add inherent value to the currency. You can also run a node, which isn't a miner, but just serves to relay transactions to miners. (That won't make you any money, but everyone has a different definition of "getting into the bitcoin world")

You'd have to buy in the neighborhood of 400,000 S9s to get to 51%. 
If the powers that be want to "kill" Bitcoin it would be through other means. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin really just has first-mover advantage. Eliminate/damage ability to convert it to fiat and it's just another crypto. For instance, what if it was suddenly illegal for a US bank to process ACH transactions for Bitcoin? It'd "survive" of course, but that's not really the point.

Any exchange. 
A Bitcoin transaction really only occurs on the blockchain. When you put Bitcoin into an exchange, or pull it out, that's a verifiable, blockchain transaction. (Similarly when you send fiat, that's a real movement of funds from one account to another)
When you trade, you are credited/debited but the money never really moves around on the blockchain. It's just inside of their internal system. 
It's similar to a bank. If you move money from your checking to your savings, it's not like someone goes into a box, pull outs real currency, and moves that currency to another box. It's all just numbers on a computer, until you move real money in or out of that system.

You'd see a problem present on Newegg, but at a much larger scale: like on Newegg, third-party sales/FBA would likely not be in Bitcoin. 
Also, imagine the headache if they process refunds in fiat when people try to return products because the price of Bitcoin went up quickly. I suspect they'd be converting everything to fiat immediately, and I wonder if that'd put pressure on the price?

Virtually every scam (or blatantly imminent failure) I've seen come through here has its apologists and defenders screaming "stop the FUD!" when there's mature criticism.

It's not a matter of being progressive. You still have to pay your expenses and turn a profit. More so if you're publicly traded. (May want to take a peek at how well $OSTK is doing)
Yes, you've pointed out why BTC debit cards have failed miserably: they charge a fee to the buyer, even though most bank debit cards do not. 
No one is going to use a stable coin to fund this. They're going to be using crypto, and that's where a company can play games with exchange rate. 
The only way this is a win for anyone is if SPEDN can beat the rate merchants are currently paying for debit cards.

Of course, but you're missing the point of what I'm saying. 
When people say Bitcoin is deflationary, they're talking about the production of blocks. The price that people are willing to pay on the exchanges isn't directly related to this. The mechanics of how Bitcoin works do not change, but the price goes up, and goes down. Psychology of the market, the state of alternate investments like the stock market, etc, all play a role. 
In other words, you're confusing correlation with causation.
