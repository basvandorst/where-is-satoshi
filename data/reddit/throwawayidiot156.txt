Will have to
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:33:00
It wasn't even a reply, it was posted from their twitter handle, blue tick and all!  
\(I only saw it because someone I follow on twitter with a huge user base RT it!\) 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:34:26
Yeah they have done.  Especially as someone with a huge userbase on twitter RT it originally \(thats how i saw it\)
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:23:56
yeah I can with some hard work! \- I do feel sorry for those who have ended up losing more. Lesson learnt!
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:00:10
Sweet dreams?
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:33:23
Yeah, probably all I can do!
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:30:22
Man up? \- did you just assume my gender?! :P
Mcafee \- yuck!
Autofellatio \- do u think i'd be so down if I could do that?
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:27:13
I did a who\-is search on the domain which just links to other domains / fake addresses, unfortunately!
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:15:07
send me $200 and ill send you $400
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:21:29
I wouldn't if i was asked to wire it \- the fact it came from a compromised legit twitter handle is where i put my \(mis\)trust in.
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:34:03
Yeah probably all i can do. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:36:34
I wont admit how experienced I am \- i can usually spot a scam a mile off, this got me, however...
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:34:03
I really wasnt thinking straight.. I have no idea why I thought it would be a good idea. Nevermind. I will make the money back! Somehow.
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:34:50
not heard of elastos, sounds like something off Futurama!
@_date: 2018-05-31 16:30:16
Funny thing is I've made money in the past using BTC! 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:37:17
Yes please, you're wearing deodorant? 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:34:57
Yeah i will get the money somehow!...
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:23:16
thanks, lesson learnt!
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:26:26
Thats terrible. We all need to be more vigilant. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:31:14
I hesitated much. I have learnt alot of lessons in the past, this will add to the long list..
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:13:42
Unfortunately, being human, I am in no way perfect. Am sure you, like everyone else, has made some stupid decisions in their lifetime. Especially when under the influence of emotion/alcohol/drugs etc. The fact that it came from an official twitter account, unfortunately legitimised it.
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:22:28
funnily enough its now been deleted!
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:42:07
Yeah you're definitely right there.
Had it not had been tweeted by an official account with millions of followers and RT by someone I follow with thousands, I probably wouldn't have gone near it!
I supposed if its too good to be true, it probably is!
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:19:10
You do have a point.
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:03:31
I havent got $800, you joker, you.
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:55:19
Are you friends with George from my bank?
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:53:52
Really wasn't a good idea I know.. I also know now to not make decisions when I'm tired and emotionally compromised. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:47:37
unfortunately I wasn't a member of this sub until after.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:07:16
Scam. ;) Now who's the idiot ?
Jokes aside, I was not "with it" mentally, albeit a rubbish excuse, it's the truth. I am wondering how many fall for things like this as mine was just a moment of vulnerability, whereas there are some who are like it all the time.
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:54:59
Who am I to disagree\(?\) \[cant remember the words and am not googling it!\)
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:47:50
Yes hope so!
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:00:47
Tweet has now been removed. :/
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:01:24
Slightly sexist and assumptive.
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:52:55
Yeah, 'cause I'd waste my time making up something like that, believe what you may. Don't waste our time quibbling over the legitimacy of a story. I have nothing to gain from making this up, at the very least its highlighted one of the scams to whoever may read this post.
