I HOPE it's as simple as seed words in picture, otherwise I won't waste my time ever again on these since creators tend to make it super hard and only for those who have specific knowledge in cryptography and coding.

What pattern
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:24:47
How are they paired?

I hope this can be solved just using your eyes and connecting dots, creating a picture or an object that's visible once dots are connected and gives you a clear answer. No coding, programming, crypto knowledge and similiar stuff because most of us don't know shit about that.
I'm sure we'll all be like "how tf I didn't see that, it was there the whole time!" :)

Props to him

If this requires some crazy math crypto knowledge that 95% of this subreddit doesn't have, I'll be so disappointed.
OP, I should be studying for my finals.. why are you doing this to me!

Over 2 million btc received over time lol
Current holdings around 3.5k BTC I believe
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:11:31
I find it impossible for the price to drop below $5k but we'll see.

Read my question boi. What other currencies? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:54:05
Dash holders seem to be pretty cocky with their coin
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:52:53
I don't really see it being used all too much in the future with its current technology, unless something changes of course.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:37:06
Dash, LTC, VTC? Something like that?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:36:12
How is LN planning to solve these things? What will paying for coffee with Bitcoin look like?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:11:11
Can you mention some of those and provide source as well?
