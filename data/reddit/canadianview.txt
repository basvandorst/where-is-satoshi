Too little, too late.

Maybe we should be thinking of applying the too big to fail idea to Coinbase as well...   ��

Do you take interac email payment?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:16:12
Doesn't engender trust in coinbase. That cements my decision of never using them.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:48:03
Thank you so much! I've been looking for a collection like this to learn from for a while now.

It means Hold On for Dear Life
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:23:11
So what's Coinbase's problem, then?

Faith in bitcoin is life-changing!

He has an active role in said cake's creation and maintenance, though.

How much more secure is Electrum compare to online providers? You have your seed, yes, but does being exposed to online activity compromise it?
Is it best to use an old unplugged desktop and generate private keys, public keys, print and wipe said desktop after?

It only took a serious boycott threat to convince them. Doesn't sound like they listen to the community without a gun to their head.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:00:20
Can we make this a pinned post?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:38:45
This response made me laugh out loud! Well done, sir.
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:00:03
Really haven't heard a lot from him since this interview, have we?
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:00:57
Most excellent, dear sir! Huzzzzah!

Paypal can censor anytime anywhere
Bitcoin is uncensorable
@_date: 2015-08-29 18:37:16
Couldn't agree more. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:58:15
Is Electrum also safe? Trying to decide.

When it comes to MMA and Bitcoin, NY state's politicians have been bought out and given their marching orders. NY will remain a holdout for years to come, even after mass adoption comes, MARK MY WORDS!!

Thank God for miners who love bitcoin!

6 hours for me now.

I use them as well with no problems.  They have no monthly or  ATM fees either.

Do i support this and consequently UASF by downloading and upgrading my full node to this version?
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:58:53
This fits my line of thinking exactly!
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:42:32
On cryptocoinsnews.com , they're running a positive story on it. Maybe they don't know or are complicit???
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:55:28
Is it the same commands from OS X terminal?

I think this is only a good idea if other nations do this as well, like France wants to seem to do, in order to give an opportunity for arbitrage. If only the US had ETFs and the like for Bitcoin, wouldn't they be able to unduly influence it's role and worth as a multinational currency?

I didn't know McAfee wanted bitcoin to fork. He seems to praise bitcoin itself in every interview I've seen.

How can even their own investors trust these guys?

Fees, not fee's. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 09:59:02
Mais ton anglais est très bon maintenant que les insultes commencent.
Peux-tu expliquer pourquoi la France n'a pas peur de Bitcoin et du crypto en général?
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:09:12
Acting like children fucks over all people who support bitcoin. Get your shit together!

Just like a distribution company selling Coca-Cola is not the Coca-Cola CEO.

Can u give some to every person  posting to this thread?
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:30:52
I was wondering this very same thing.
@_date: 2015-10-27 10:35:25
Hmmmm. Injecting your citizenry's pension funds and letting it all ride in the currency war battlefield. Sounds like a great idea!!
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:20:24
You guys need to hug it out!
@_date: 2015-10-28 19:10:27
Yes, but the point is that it is deliberately misleading so as to bring negative press to bitcoin as a whole.
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:20:34
You guys need to hug it out!
@_date: 2015-10-28 20:03:18
The ex-CEO of a defunct bitcoin exchange would be accurate. Bitcoin CEO sounds like the guy had control of the whole bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-10-28 22:49:55
True. I guess it shows how journalistic integrity and accuracy come second to selling sensationalism. It sucks that we have to have some background knowledge of the subject matter in order to truly have an informed opinion and not be slightly misled.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:18:31
I think you are right. Holding out at this point will only hurt Bitmain and the bitcoin economy as a whole. There is too much lose on the whole. Let's pray that Jihan is rational enough to come to this conclusion on his own.

Question here:
If I do a fresh install of linux mint, then install electrum, make a wallet and write down the 12 word seed, send bitcoin to it and then delete the wallet on the computer, am I reasonably safe?
