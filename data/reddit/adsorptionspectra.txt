Here is a short guide that I followed:
BUT 
1. i didnt have to install the “Go” and “lneconnect” as it was already installed on my Raspiblitz
2. Pasting all three lines into the torrc file at the same time made the tor not working for me. After I saved the torrc file and restarted to tor service I checked with “sudo nyx” to see if the tor was running and it wasnt. So I pasted on line at the time. Every time I restarted tor and checked the “sudo nyx” if the tor is running. This way i made the tor service running in my case
3. Once you have the lndconnect string you can use Zap (tor works only for ios) or you can use Zeus (tor works only for android)

Thank you! Kind stranger.

Not in Zap app as far as I know, but Zeus app is supporting Tor for Android.

Be my own bank and give back to the network.

I connected my RaspiBlitz over tor to Zap and now I can manage my node from outside of my local network. Zap dropped the update with support for tor on iOS like a month ago. If you have androind the Zeus has tor support for remote node management. 
If you want to kow how to connect Zap or Zeus over tor with Raspiblitz let me know and I will post a short guide here.

I really want to say thank you to Zap dev team for pushing the user experience for LND Tor nodes further. 
I run my own LND node and I cannot (I also dont want to) to run it as a public node because of my ISP network configuration. So for me, in order to run LND node, Tor is a must. But ever since I started with the node it was painfully hard to use it remotely (but not impossible). I had to use RTL web interface with special settings on Onion browser on my iPhone and it just was terrible user experience. I knew I had remote access to my LND wallet and could do transactions, but I was thinking about it as an emergency access. I really was dreaming about app with nice UI which I would be happy using and which could connect to my node over Tor. Then today, Zap dev team dropped the update for iOS and I cannot be happier!!!! 
The UX/UI is going to drive the adoption for the rest of the people who dont get so excited about the tech behind Bitcoin as we are, mark my words.

Thank you for the info. If we will see T2 chip on iPhones released this September then with the combination of T2 and criptokit sdk on iOS13 hopefully we can see decently secure wallets for people who are willing to trade convenience for anonymity.

What didnt work for you? I am trying to install myNode on RBP 4 and it got stuck at QuickSync 71.32% and it didnt move for 15 hours.
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:40:42
Seem pretty cool, I will give it a shoot once my RBP arrives.
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:47:43
Hi u/WalrusSwarm, did you actually manage to make the DIY version fo Casa Node? I really would like to try their version because of the UI. I have also RPB4. There are no guides on how to do it at all!  
Or did you find any other project with nice UI? I tried myNode but only their paid version is supporting TOR which I need.

Just switched to 2TB HDD. Hopefully it will be fine. Thanks :)

This is awesome! Thanks!
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:42:58
Thank you! My RBP should arrive on Friday or Monday, I will let you know once it’s up.
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:45:03
Thank you! If I will try this I will let you know
@_date: 2019-08-31 19:59:09
Maybe apple will release iPhones with T2 chips in a few weeks.
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:01:28
u/tehelsper I'm installing your myNode software on RBP 4 and everything was going fine but at one point QuickSync got stuck at 71.32% and it didnt move for 15 hours. Should I do something or is this normal?
@_date: 2019-10-22 17:20:41
Thank you! I will try Raspibolt. As it seems they have very detailed guide as well,
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:21:51
It's 500gb, regular HDD. I restarted the process and now the QuickSync (Copying files... This will take several hours.) got stuck at 71.49%
I will also try Telegram. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:47:56
Interesting... but wait, with myNode software you need to pay to for adding TOR functionality?
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:59:05
Thanks, I will go with Raspiblitz then.
@_date: 2019-12-21 23:23:27
Check my comment on how to connect remotely to your node over Tor, altho it is for raspiblitz the principle should be the same:
 
Let me know if you need any help following the guide.

I run raspiblitz on Raspberry pi with LND 0.7.1 - beta. 
How do I update the LND? When I check in the updates  menu there are no new updates.
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:17:41
Seems like Raspiblitz released last update on 5th of September. I expect a new update soon. 
I would gladly switch to casa but I not everybody have 300 $ laying around. ( and their DIY guid and repo is bullshit since they dont provide Docker Composer script)
@_date: 2019-12-13 07:18:08
Wow, did you actually read my comment?  I am literally asking how to update. I know running outdated software is harmful. Your comment is not helpful at all.
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:59:52
Try DropBit
@_date: 2019-09-04 22:25:59
Now it’s clearer to me. Thank you for the explanation.
@_date: 2019-09-05 09:33:13
Can you elaborate on what those two lines mean?
@_date: 2019-09-13 21:24:38
How can it take 10 days?! That’s crazy. When I send it as regular SEPA transfer I have it there the next banking day (altho the bank says it usually takes 1-3 days) but with Revolut fast transfer I have it there even the same banking day as I make the payment.
@_date: 2019-09-05 09:39:54
Isnt the other crossing called a Death Cross? Signalling a downward trend?
@_date: 2019-09-13 17:39:49
 I have Danske Bank too but I live in Denmark. I use revolut to buy crypto. Just top up the revolut account instantly with debit card (no fee), exchange the currency for really cool exchange rate and then SEPA transfer to an exchange. This is the fastest, most reliable and cheapest way for me to buy crypto. 
(The SEPA transfer to coinbase takes one day)

The new changes are pretty cool, is Bluewallet on part with Greenwallet when it comes to security? So far Greenwallet is the only one I trust on mobile devices.
