bitcoin wasn't hacked. exchanges were. that's like not trusting dollars because a bank was robbed.
@_date: 2016-08-26 05:51:26
I'm assuming you're on android? perhaps you installed a rogue coinbase app somehow. Did you jailbreak it? Did you install any other bitcoin related apps? Jailbreaking a phone will open your phone up to security vulnerabilities on some platforms. Allow rogue apps (ie: an innocent looking Bitcoin ticker app) could replace your Coinbase app w/o your knowledge with malware.
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:00:29
its like when i typed my password w/ screensaver on (or so I thought, monitor hadn't turned on yet) and it went in the the public chatroom instead of the password field.
@_date: 2016-08-10 01:13:52
But isn't it damn near impossible that this hash is also used in a bitcoin transaction?
It seems to me he just pasted the wrong thing from his clipboard and deleted it immediately.
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:41:42
What's the site??

oh shit that's right. when you posted this i thought "didn't he do that years ago?" - EVACUATE COINBASE!!!!

Wow, that makes me want to avoid Purse.io

you need the private keys setup in a trust to be passed down.
@_date: 2016-04-20 04:00:14
i don't trust encryption. not that its not secure but that i would get locked out forever. This just happened to a friend of mine today with his windows machine. He's screwed now. Lost his entire database.
@_date: 2016-04-20 04:43:26
seed phrase is the only method I use...I don't do hardware encryption -- had too many hard drives die on me.
@_date: 2016-08-29 06:35:27
a lot of things happened in that short timer period, but I don't see any evidence they are related in any way.
@_date: 2016-04-20 05:05:49
Damn. I better get to work. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 02:27:11
there was something called green address....but I couldn't tell if it was a wallet or not. I didn't quite understand. I ended up using coinkite but then for any payment features you have to pay. Plus the .onion is not in the true spirit of anonymity.
@_date: 2016-04-20 02:07:37
I looked as well.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:57:59
its all good man. my buddy bought 4.
@_date: 2016-04-19 22:03:43
killed it with the `/s`

awesome. sending to my buddies. we all want these. but man $12 for shipping??
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:26:56
Where can I buy these?
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:06:34
on a mac you just do `brew install imagemagick` and then run `identify -verbose photo.png`

thank god i saw this coming and withdrew everything a couple of weeks ago. never leave your shit on an exchange people.
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:03:43
$75T and that was from 3 years ago

@_date: 2016-06-05 19:41:10
What about if all you have is the seed phrase?
@_date: 2016-06-10 22:09:39
what i mean is did all the trades go through in that little flash crash?
@_date: 2016-06-05 21:17:29
Even if the electrum wallet somehow went defunct?  I could still recover the Bitcoin using the seed phrase?
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:41:47
What about if all you have is the seed phrase?
@_date: 2016-06-29 16:29:21
terrible :P besides that obvious bad ux the rest of the site is great, I love the design.

A critical bug. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:52:06
nothing. its just better if you want to preserve anonymity to not-reuse address. If you only use one address and your address is associated with you they can associate your entire transaction history with your identity.
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:07:07
I don't get it. Where is the prediction?

If there are 100,000,000 satoshis in 1 BTC and a satoshi was worth 1 dollar...wouldn't that make 1BTC worth 100M instead of 1M?

i guess it needs to be said again. if you don't control the keys...its not your bitcoin.

yeah. but the fees are like a penny.
@_date: 2016-09-04 07:02:47
I think the name is dumb...and their first press release about how they were going to be the regulation-friendly crypto currency. Just sounded rather pointless if you know why people enjoy using crypto currencies.

10x hopefully.
@_date: 2016-09-02 05:15:07
i might be wrong about that. does circle connect with your bank? if not use coinbase

send from Jaxx to that address. and don't fuck it up :)

They never had credibility to begin with. Honestly did anyone actually think "programmable money" wouldn't have bugs?!
@_date: 2016-05-01 01:19:43
Yes. much better than multibit. The thing I like is I get a seed phrase to use as a recovery incase my HD crashes. Already had to do this twice. The plugins are nice too, like syncing notes/descriptions for transactions, although this may not be very private....but I'm guessing if you want a hosted blockchain wallet then you don't mind.
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:24:05
 asking aaron. maybe there is a way 
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:50:15
no reason for it to go up or stay up. this was a pump and dump based on halvening. Now that's its over the price will drop.
@_date: 2016-07-30 18:47:15
No i didn't.

That may have been it. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 04:11:46
Yeah. I think the people behind BTC-e want to see the corrupt agent that busted DPR go to jail himself.
But also, I doubt they would have revealed the logs if they weren't over tor. But yeah, nothing is 100% safe. All it takes is someone with a gun or a warrant to get you to comply.
@_date: 2016-07-12 03:52:23
It won't go high. it can't handle scaling. transactions will increase to the point where they aren't going through and everyone will lose faith.
