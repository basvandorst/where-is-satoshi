good stuff man, whats your twitter?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:13:17
i would say since it is at a low price now
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:46:10
it has and is what do you have to say now?
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:18:30
a dip is bound to happen after the fork, it just sucks with gains like this everyone has FOMO like me especially lol but everytime I buy because I think it will not come back down it does, so I'm gonna wait it out, it might go up until the fork but it 99.9% will dip after the fork
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:45:55
well it has, any response now?
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:13:14
so your saying it will not dip?
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:38:55
I think I'm going to because these fuckers could make B2X over take bitcoin in value worst case scenario
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:57:50
i don't fuck with that
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:11:33
but when and how much? it just keeping going up
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:32:20
it just broke 6700 i mean I'm starting to think it wont dip
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:06:48
so is it even worth getting in before the fork for the B2X?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:51:40
are you familiar with BTX?
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:06:58
so if there is a dip it has to be before November 16 SegWit2x, but who the fuck knows with this wild west madness, if it doesn't dip by then I'm buying before to get B2X
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:04:13
but it just keeps going up, and when it the time time the price has gone up and down that much
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:54:51
what do you think about B2X, BTG, and BCH all pumping this week?
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:35:51
do you see B2X future value going up at all?
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:16:28
do you think it will dip before the fork
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:30:36
yeah it is complete chaos lol I'm gonna wait and see when to buy back in but there has to be a point its passed 6700 right now, I mean I believe it will be up to 10 grand in a few months so i do not know how big of a dip is coming at this point
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:35:43
how far of a drop are you talking?
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:25:17
I mean I can see a little under 5k but you think it will go that low?
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:52:18
i duno thats a long drop, whens the last time it went up and down 1500$ in one day
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:48:13
do you see a significant dip in bitcoin from this point on?
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:05:04
do you think it will dip before then?
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:29:53
Yeah they have a few around down here in Ft myers
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:56:35
LMAO and I thought I was a newb!
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:23:51
so if your keys were offline during the next bitcoin fork would you still get the new altcoin equal to your bitcoin holdings?
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:22:01
do you know if GDAX is going to support the new bitcoin version and if not would bitfinex a good wallet to use to get the new version of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:50:09
The exchanges hitbtc and YoBit are supporting segwit2x and will give you your share of Bitcoin Gold they said, which one would you prefer?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:53:17
you think it will come back down before the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:13:33
what is your hardware wallet preference?
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:56:27
is that your preference? what are other real wallets that are good to store with?
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:03:30
im going to get one sooner than later but I have to learn more about it. Do you think GDAX will actually honor B2X like they are saying they are?
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:26:41
so if you have tether on there you won't be able to buy tokens in the US with USDT?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:03:25
