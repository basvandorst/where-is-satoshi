Let me ask you something, How do you know they would not steal your coins? What kind of hardware resources are they using because that is a determining factor in these situations

 Just threw him a wallet with 15 BTC to try and recover. They will present a full report and wish him well and will await to see his experience on lost pass phrases.

Fake Name domain registration as well.

I'm definitely going to check this out, thanks for the tips. If I can get some trial time I will report back, I'm still learning.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:43:10
lol, my thought in 2012 when I lost the password is that by now some nice hardware would be out for cracking. Maybe in another 5 years things will be alright and could cut 1.268753695×10³³ in half  :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:49:00
I do not know that's what this guy told me who dumped the wallet into a text file. Then proceed to tell me that the default key is what I needed to crack.  (i'm a nerd but know very little about cracking other then clicking  on scripts)
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:39:36
I talked to Amazon today to see about cracking this SOB and right now I got a program that can utilize @ max 32 gpu and 32 cpu.  p2.16xlarge has 64 cores  but we are looking at $17.344 an hour  YIKES!  So my plan is this, I have a super computer already I may build one  under a business LLC and then write off everything when the Password cracks.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:43:03
I'm no way shape or form confident in him lol I put an ad out for help and he came knocking and since at the time there was very little  action taken on this I went with him but yet nothing came of it. Only when this shit hit 7k was I thinking I'd take a stab at anything new. Was hoping that there was some sorta issues with the old wallets or something that made cracking them easier. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:59:18


maybe something like this i could build 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:22:44
Is this service something other then brute force?
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:24:47
I have a computer capable of 500k passwords a second but anything other then bruteforce would help because knowing myself I'd probably have a 26+char password.  probably take 10 years to crack
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:26:26
Indeed there was. :( Wish this were true on
	
11/21/12   is the last time I had someone look into it, did a dump of the key  and they said it was a SHA-256 Key.
 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:14:41
It's cluster fuck. :) I know my password is tight because when I was researching BTC everything I read said "make sure the pswd is long" and not normally using long passwords I came up with something that was high 20's for characters + the actual wallet ID number. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:33:48
lol just an alert.. That is all

Where did I mention bitfinex in this post?
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:56:17
I like this site because it's low key (Private club) and not a whole bunch of trash talking or bots in the gaming room. I'm serious if anyone wants to split this with me I do web development and wouldn't mind owning a chunk of this awesome pie.    Let ME KNOW!

This is a complete review of the Top 3 Bitcoin Poker websites. It is based off many different factors and allows users to draw their own opinion as to which Bitcoin Poker website is number one. It gives you stats and a few interviews from owners and top poker players in the industry. I find it helpful but I'm biased and prefer  mainly for their every Saturday 10 BTC Freeroll and once monthly 50 BITCOIN freeroll. I suggest reading it as the information is good but the site looks just text based. Happy Bitcoining &amp; Poker Playing  
@_date: 2013-05-23 00:53:20
Lmao they don't even have ads or donations MAJOR SCAM lol (sarcasm) I will be submitting some sites shortly! 
@_date: 2013-05-27 10:25:13
Lmao yeah I forgot how long it took me. But I know it took awhile!
@_date: 2013-05-24 06:53:03
I heard they are working with  . I follow LBP and SWC daily and used to play on both and know that the Maven servers they use was being looked at by LOCK. However they wanted the database without all the follow of complaints. So hopefully they are working with LBP that would be great for the bitcoin community. Besides that LBP uses No automation with transfers so that would be the best way to protect users. Lock becomes a target if they use automation.. :-/

Sorry I thought I had to submit the site then submit a Text article.  I will switch it up from now on.  I don't own the site just helping the community.

Well I will tell you my little way of coming back from losses. I play at  and normally do pretty good. Here is a pretty good strategy for winning Bitcoins after a bad Poker loss. I play during the week only depositing 1 BTC Max. (most days I win but i'm not superman)  SO lets say I gamble for 10 weeks and in those ten weeks I go up and down but at the end of ten weeks Im down 1 BTC.  My little account program accounts for 1 BTC deposit max per a week for ten weeks.  SO now here is the trick to comeback at no cost.  Live bitcoin poker offers 10 BTC freerolls on Saturdays and 50 BTC once a month. SO in that 10 weeks at max I could lose is 10 BTC if every week was bad. BUT If you play 10 Saturdays of 10 btc freerolls and 3x 50 BTC freerolls (it's 3 cuz you start on the 2nd Saturday of the month giving you an edge on the freerolls)  you could have the chance to win 250 BTC  so your odds of getting some if not all back is possible. It is a major % (not sure what it is) but it makes thing profitable?

(Will update in 24 hours)  &lt;------we were waiting on attached report----
bulknetellerbtc claims to sell bitcoins to those with neteller accounts.
I started off in live chat with a guy who told me “they” would sell me a bitcoin for $408, which is below what they are actually worth. This made alarm bells ring however, as he explained “they” had bought lots of bitcoins back when they were $80 each and are still making a good profit on every one sold, which seemed feasible to me so I decided to give it a try.
The main drawing point to this site is that it accepts neteller which is the only method of payment I can currently use. They were suspicious of me to start wanting a screenshot of my account with the correct balance in it and my name at the top. Fair enough I thought until it took them 3 hours to “verify” the screenshot I sent them….. who do they think they are? the FBI?
He then told me they were having problems with neteller lately so after I sent them the money it would be held for 7 hours before they would send the bitcoins. However, by the time 7 hours had passed due to time zone changes they were asleep so that delayed things for a further 6 hours.
After this I was awoke by an email telling me that He said he was “sent a memo from the accounting department” and the price had risen and If I wanted a bitcoin I would have to pay the difference, which is disgusting as I had paid over 12 hours previous to this and I even confirmed the amount AS $408 through an email to them. So they literally mess me about for 12-14 hours then say I’m not getting it unless I pay more!
To top it all I was told that I could no longer use neteller and that the delays were my fault because I refused to use western union (I NEVER use western union for anything, no protection), he proceeded to tell me that customers ordering small amounts always cause trouble and the whole thing was basically my own fault!
You may have noticed throughout this that I have used the word “them” with inverted commas – this is because that although he talks of a director, accounting department, and says he is only a member of support staff, I believe this is simply a one man operation wanting to give the impression as a business.
Afraid of pissing him off and him not sending my refund I buttered him up and pretended I would try again in a few days to buy more one I get my refund. I have since contacted neteller and told them that the whole thing is possibly a scam and they froze my account so I couldn’t get a refund. after an hour on the phone with the security guy (who said every rich westerner acts stupidly with money) My account was unfrozen but neteller have made it very clear I am not protected at all.
3 days later and they are not rsponding to my emails any more. Live chat claims they are online however I am met with the automated response:
“We apologize for keeping you waiting. Our operators are busy at the moment, please leave us a message with your email address and we’ll get back to you shortly.”
UPDATE: 12/24/2013
The seller now says that Neteller is investigating a transaction in their account so he cannot send me a refund for another 2 weeks at least. I offer to take a refund through another method but he says it needs to be through the same way I paid.
UPDATE: 12/24/2013
He is now pressuring me into sending another $130 so I can buy a bitcoin at the new price.
I offer to do so If i get 0.5 bitcoins upfront, after all he does have $400 of my money. he is refusing to do so, probably because they don’t exist!
UPDATE: 12/25/2013
The guy has seen this complaint and says he is “not worried” That customers go to his site without looking it up and he doesn’t care. Still no refund.
@_date: 2013-08-18 08:23:06
I agree, You can do the same things with a Bitcoin that you can do with a dollar or any other currency for that matter and good and bad come with it.
@_date: 2013-05-20 07:31:25
NO WAY! lol sounds like trolling to me! Livebitcoinpoker.com is way better, well actually lets step back for a moment. They need more players but they have a real secure way of doing everything and the security protocol is crazy awesome. I take it you missed the 10 btc freeroll on Saturday. CRAZY game but awesome and Admin kicked 100 multi accouters and set the example for other sites.  Sorry Blarg btc king maybe but what happens to kings??? They fall!
@_date: 2013-08-30 20:22:49
YEah, add them to bitcoinscammers.com  sometimes owners check that site and fix issues just to stay in the good light. 
I love  and am a strong advocate of justice. :)
@_date: 2013-08-22 05:59:21
(before Reading I'm a STRONG advocate of bitcoinscammers.com) 
Yeah, you can post sites for good and bad reasons.  It's more of community place that as stories build up they help me judge sites. Especially if it is active members on other sites who are generally honest (in my opinion)  I also think the site is a good start in awareness and if you do truly get scammed you can post specific details that just back up and verify what happen.  It's good to see someone at least trying to build awareness. So far a few owners are on their responding to people so it's good to see some people who thought they were getting scammed actually receive a solid answer/solution. Bitcoins very essence is anonymity so we will prob never have a solid system in place for scammers.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:41:54
When ever you decide to invest RESEARCH places like here, bitcoin talk and      will help you in the decision processes.

Yeah I donno why ppl keep doing it.
@_date: 2013-05-27 06:29:58
I guess there is a 4 hour wait to get in  and somebody had some free time lol
@_date: 2013-08-17 21:57:46
Hey sorry for your loss. I have had the same thing happen to me. I use  all the time and now pretty much always check it first.  It's a reasonable site  I'd encourage the community to support it's use. The guys who run it do it 100% for free and can be found on bittalk.  Anyways thanks for the information and sorry to hear it. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 01:42:07
My questions are legit I'm not trolling so I will ask you privately. How can you legally expect to stay open working within the laws of the U.S.A.? 
@_date: 2013-05-20 07:42:34
The BTC was actually WON by sofaking VS bitshark so it ended up being awesome! well played live bitcoin poker WELL PLAYED! Best funniest 10 btc freeroll in awhile!  Viva Bitcoin POKER!!
@_date: 2013-08-18 07:48:36
They are pretty honest I will "pimp" them any day.  They take no donations, bribes and never succumb to morons. It's community driven and there are sites on there that are not scams that people submit to praise.  I could only see SCAMMERS not liking a site like that. Until somehting else comes along to keep on the safe side Ill check bittlk and bitcoinscammers.  
THE OWNER DOES NOT PICK THE SITES you submit them then he adds them.  He's on bitcointalk.com all the time.  
@_date: 2013-06-07 23:44:55
Hmm 2 articles on the samething still I have questions.
How does this differ from:
Seals with clubs
Pocket Rockets
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:41:01
Kind of a good idea! Allows users to submit websites and website users who are scammers.

Hell yeah! It's about time because everyone here has one time or another has had 2nd thoughts with BTC.

I added them for you 
Just add your story :) Hope this helps
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:15:41
Well if you know about bitcointalk's crazy requirement of 4 hours of browsing before being a member it can get very tedious. This clearly made a mockery of forced Purgatory and is somewhat funny. He is on some older pages as well depending on the amount of time you want to waste going back, I'd say about 4 hours of it. HA  
@_date: 2013-05-23 05:45:38
I agree that's why I spent the day on both sites and came to the conclusion that the security at  is WAY BETTER but you do sacrifice automation time  SWC has. But in my opinion non hosted wallets and separated servers is far better and more secure then even downloaded clients. SWC put in the hard work but lost me when they got greedy and forgot about the players.  This is a little biased as I no longer care for SWC unless I can't get a game at LBP.
