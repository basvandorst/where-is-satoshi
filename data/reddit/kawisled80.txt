What if a few of them got together and shorted then did any kind of attack, real or just threatened, to tank the price? If you have that kind of power and basically no repercussions why wouldn't you? Great exit strategy.

Why does everyone insist on making an announcement giving notice to expect an announcement when it comes to bitcoin? When you are ready to say something just say it then.

Daily bitcoin trade volume is around 11 million USD per day. Daily forex trade volume is a little over 5 trillion USD per day. I hope that this can help put things in perspective for you as to why retail volume is so low. I think that expecting bitcoin sales volumes to be more than 0.05% of total at any major retailer is crazy. There is nothing wrong with building infrastructure around a currency fueled by speculation. All currencies are fueled by speculation but not all currencies are a few years old.

Go to DC for a weekend and hang out around Georgetown. If you are social you will probably meet a lobbyist. I tried to ask one what they really do for a living, like a normal day in the life, and she couldn't even explain what she does outside of getting paid to use her connections to influence politicians. They are scum. I didn't think much about lobbyists until I met a few.

A $50 change in price is more significant when the price starts at $100 as opposed to $1000. Using a log scale illustrates that in a way that is easier to visualize.

I understand your point but there is a difference between making a payment and exchanging currency. I paid $9.95 to exchange $100 USD to about 60 euros a couple days ago at an airport. Exchange fees are not unique to bitcoin and 5% is actually pretty cheap compared to what I paid.

I don't understand why people do a lot of things with their money but it is their right to do it. Bitcoin lets you do whatever you want with your money and nobody, not a bank government or person on the Internet, can force you otherwise.

I use an app called "coinbits" available off the App Store to scan QR codes with my iPhone and then I can copy the address from that. I use coinbase to store my spending money so I have to login to the site on my phone to complete the transaction. Not exactly the most elegant solution but it works.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:03:42
The difference is that Bitcoin has the potential to make transaction reversal consumer protection obsolete. Credit cards do not have that potential because of the points the comic is making, the system is backwards. Imagine your Bitcoin wallet being so secure that fraudulent transactions are impossible, there is no way for a transaction to occur without your consent. This is certainly not the case right now but I believe that it will be once hardware security technology catches up. My bold prediction for the future: Bitcoins will someday not be stored on computers as we know them today but instead on a new appliance or device dedicated to bitcoin security, storage, and transfer.

There doesn't need to be fractional reserve or a central bank for lending. A few of the big exchanges (OKCoin mentioned in the article being one of them) have p2p lending systems in place to trade on margin, all backed by actual dollars and bitcoins. This guy needs to do a little more research.

I'll share a recent experience I had using purse.io since there seems to be a lot of misconceptions in the comments from people who haven't used the service. 
There is no "discount" in reality. The buyer is paying full price for the item on your amazon wish list and purse.io holds the sellers bitcoin in escrow until the seller receives the item and releases them. Saying that you are buying a gift card at a 30% discount is not true, you are trading bitcoin at a markup to someone that is paying amazon full price for your item with a credit card. In theory this markup makes sense since besides circle, where else can you buy bitcoin with a credit card? Using the amazon wish list is a clever way of doing this. I wish it worked as well as it does in theory. 
I created a couple wish lists, sent some bitcoin to purse.io and set up a 20% discount. One item was about $50 so they would receive $40 worth of bitcoin at whatever the bitstamp price is at the time of purchase. I had two items up and within an hour or so I had a buyer, or so I thought. About ten minutes after I got the email saying a buyer was found the item popped back up in my amazon wish list because amazon canceled it, probably because they detected it as fraud. Purse.io detected this and relisted my sell order automatically. This happened about 3-4 times on each item by people with 0 rating before someone with a higher rating purchased the item and it finally went through. I received the items a couple days later and released the bitcoins from escrow. I gave and received positive feedback on both transactions. 
I think that there are legitimate people paying a premium for bitcoin using credit cards on purse.io but there are also scammers trying to use stolen credit cards, maybe at a 3:1 ratio of scammer to legit. I'm sure amazon deals with stolen credit cards constantly and their system seemed to handle it well as far as I can tell.  
I don't think amazon would ever come back to me if down the road it turned out that the credit card someone used was stolen. The wish lists are anonymous, I have no information on who bought the item and amazon knows it. I'm not sure what information amazon has on the buyer but they accepted the order,not me, and would be responsible for it. The default setting on amazon is to surprise you with the gift. You wouldn't even know someone bought you something until it arrives at your door. How can you be liable for that purchase?
That said I won't be using purse.io anymore. They need to implement some sort of buyer verification across the board where it is known they are not using a fraudulent credit card. Maybe do a couple small deposits like a typical bank account or credit card verification on venmo, dwolla, coinbase, or circle? They do have a guarantee program where if you specify 10% or less you will be matched with only "VIP" buyers (invite only) in 24 hours or purse.io will buy it for you but it isn't enough. It gives you a very weird feeling to know that people are actively trying to defraud amazon. I'm sure amazon deals with it constantly but I don't like being an indirect participant. I have no idea if the people that I completed the trades with are legit or just didn't get caught yet. The multiple fraudulent purchases that were caught is not a good user experience. The $20 or so I saved wasn't really worth it. Overall I like the idea and wish it would work but right now it just isn't for me.

*Human-readable, secure payment destinations-- customers will be asked to authorize payment to "website.com" instead of an inscrutable, 34-character bitcoin address.
*Secure proof of payment, which the customer can use in case of a dispute with the merchant.
*Resistance from man-in-the-middle attacks that replace a merchant's bitcoin address with an attacker's address before a transaction is authorized with a hardware wallet.
*Payment received messages, so the customer knows immediately that the merchant has received, and has processed (or is processing) their payment.
*Refund addresses, automatically given to the merchant by the customer's wallet software, so merchants do not have to contact customers before refunding overpayments or orders that cannot be fulfilled for some reason.

Only about 10% of the population has the capacity to think innovatively. The people that understand bitcoin but do not like it can only see it for what it is now and not for the potential for what it can become. They use arguments such as it's to hard to use, to insecure, offers no benefits over credit cards but can't see that in the future these problems can and will be solved. Problems that are impossible with the current model but trivial for bitcoin because it is a fundamental change. A total change in approach and thinking to the way we do things now. There is no use arguing or trying to convince these people, just like trying to convince someone 500 years ago the world is round when the people that believed it is flat cannot conceive of any other shape.

Can't they just refile the application if it isn't approved by the March deadline? I only have experience with FDA approvals but from what I have read while following this ETF approval they are very similar. The project I worked on for FDA approval kept getting bounced back to us with more questions and action items at every deadline and wasn't approved until the final day. If they didn't approve it that final day we would have had to refile but it wasn't dead unless we decided to kill it.

In your scenario the only people effected by the cash out of stolen coins are the thieves themselves. The red flag is "how did you get that much money?" and not "we traced these coins on the open ledger back to known stolen coins so we think you stole them."
In the currently happening scenario at btc-e involving bitcoins other people with legitimately obtained money are affected. Btc-e's pool of coins was effectively tainted after the stolen coins were deposited so they took it upon themselves to untaint them. This wouldn't be the case with zerocash, zerocoin, or monero. The private ledgers ensure fungibility and all coins in btc-e's pool would be treated the same because it would be impossible to differentiate them. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 13:13:32
Take a look into Monero. After doing my research it is the coin I invested in because I had the same issue you did with the open ledger. In addition to being able to see how much money you have in your account I don't like that people can see my transaction history. 
One nice thing about Monero that it doesnt get enough credit for is you can reuse the same address since everything is private. They implemented something called openalias so instead of having an address that is a long string of random numbers and letters you can have an address that looks more like an email address and is easy to remember.

The $20 bill in my wallet doesn't come with a list of all its previous transactions attached to it. 
Someone could argue that both coins in your example are now tainted and that it would be immoral to accept either as payment. The fact that you could make that argument at all means that the bitcoins are not fungible. It would probably be relatively trivial to blacklist those coins if you wanted too. I have no idea if the $20 in my wallet was ever stolen and have no way of finding out so it is fungible.

The blockchain is keeping the log.  Here is a quote from the wiki article on coinjoin which is how dark wallet operates. It is not 100% anonymous and actually worse than 0% anonymous because people think it works when it actually doesn't. 
"Consultant Kristov Atlas,[9] author of the book «Anonymous Bitcoin»,[10] published a research titled «Weak Privacy Guarantees for SharedCoin Mixing Service».[11] Document states that «SharedCoin service should be used only as a light protective measure for financial privacy». Within the research author developed a tool called 'CoinJoin Sudoku'[12] that can identify transactions as using SharedCoin and detect relationships between specific payments and payees.[13]"

Xmr.to is a third party website you have to trust so it would be best to do your homework before using it and trusting it. I have and do. Having a max transaction size of 1 btc and transactions only taking a couple minutes to complete limits the risk because if the operation went south they wouldn't be able to do much damage before the community realized what was going on. It is probably less risky and provides better anonymity than Bitcoin mixing services in my opinion.

Bitcoin is far from perfect. Mining centralization, the open ledger (people can see your account balances and where you are spending money?), lack of scalability, lack of fungibility, just to name a few things. It's very short sighted to think that Bitcoin will or should be the top cryptocurrency 10 or even 5 years from today. 
I used to be all about Bitcoin and I still buy and spend it a couple times a week but I think the open ledger will keep it from ever going mainstream. Something better will replace it. That's my opinion.

Lack of privacy and as a result fungibility. Rumors of coinbase tracking people's transactions, suggestions to blacklist coins anytime there is a major theft, dumps on the market when there is a jump in Bitcoin days destroyed, the FBI saying how easy it was to track Silk Road coins...
Assume that Bitcoin has no volatility but instead its value grows at a steady 5% per year. How can I convince the CEO of the company I work for that we should do all business in Bitcoin. We are an international company selling products all over the world so it would make sense to have one currency that you can send anywhere instantly but the open ledger means that our competitors could potentially see who we are doing business with and how much money is going in and out. Who we are selling too, who our suppliers are, who we are using for advertising. We make all of our suppliers sign a confidentiality agreement saying they will not reveal that they produce parts for us. Bitcoin would be out of the question for the open ledger alone. 
Google tracks a lot less interesting things about us. Imagine if they put some of their resources towards Bitcoin transactions. 
A quote from Edward Snowdens reddit ama.
"We can devise means, through the application and sophistication of science, to remind governments that if they will not be responsible stewards of our rights, we the people will implement systems that provide for a means of not just enforcing our rights, but removing from governments the ability to interfere with those rights."
Bitcoin takes away the governments ability to take it away from you but not the ability to see what you are doing with it.

Yes, potentially. Is there a computer network with a public database of cash serial numbers and transaction history to check against? Not that I know of but Bitcoin has one. Doesn't that concept sound strange to you even a little bit? Imagine if you had to put your dollars through a scanner so the serial number could be verified against the public database and the cashier could say oops your $20 is coming up as stolen. Great, no more counterfeiting but now you can blacklist. 


I have never seen cocaine on any of my money, let's be realistic here. Attacks on bitcoins fungibility and privacy is not some fringe what if scenario, it is happening right now. I am a big Bitcoin supporter but this isn't a problem that is going to go away on its own. The ability to blacklist coins for any reason needs to be eliminated. I don't know if that is possible with an open ledger. 
The link below is one of many examples.

Yes I do, as well as bitcoins. I am not naive enough to think that either is perfect and couldn't come to zero as fast I can hit the sell button though. I think monero is technologically superior on paper but is way to young to be taken seriously.

Don't get married to any one technology, this landscape changes very quickly.

The dedicated hardware device is most important in my opinion. Bitcoin is extremely user unfriendly at the moment. Trevzor is heading in the right direction but still isn't enough. Bitcoin storage and transfer needs to be completely fool proof before it can be mainstream. The computer needs to be taken out of the equation and it has to be impossible for someone to screw up for bitcoin to succeed.
