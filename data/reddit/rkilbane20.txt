Better update your post soon to 18k
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:29:55
Coinbase and GDAX are the same company. Transfer money into your USD account on coinbase then transfer the cash to GDAX. GDAX gives you better buying flexibility with stop and limit orders and lower fees. Transactions between the two are instant and free.

people sold
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:46:44
I missed it did it take all night?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:34:52
This will get downvoted but Coinbase is 100% backed is case they get hacked. I believe it is US only but not if you get you login stolen, then they wont back it. So put on two step verification.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:28
Coinbase is always more expensive it seems.  The market price is changing so fast too. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:20:08
It went down like 600 bucks shortly after. Back up 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:02:36
So close then someone sold 48 and 24 BTC and it started dropping. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:03:34
Every coin will be the same way if they get as popular.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:39:53
I bought in at 11..and 12... do I buy in at 16.5????
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:07:43
It always seems like you've bought in at the wrong time, only time will tell.  
Edit: I bought BTC and LTC at what seemed like an ATH or bad decision and both have skyrocketed. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:28:37
I thought buying LTC at 135 was high so I didn't...that was a mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:54:14
I was just thinking the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:27:42
Give it a minute
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:09:41
Day trading his hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:08:51
gdax has been flat for the past 30 minutes and barely moved since then.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:49:47
18k looks like the next wall. Not as big as yesterday’s. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:42:42
It is time!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:10
I’m all goooooood
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:31:02
I did yesterday when I bought around this price. Need to transfer more. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:49:01
 Went to bed last night thinking this wasn’t going to be good when I wake up. Now it’s almost at 18k. Guess I was wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:38
That’s a federal law...
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:21:57
Nobody can give you the answer. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:39
PANIC BUY!
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:51:19
Nice to wake up to 18.2k. New ATH soon? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:56
Nobody knows 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:35:16
and you can't sell until like 9 days later when it finally shows up into your account.

@_date: 2017-12-12 14:16:36
WTF LITECOIN
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:27:31
I saw it below 11k
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:48:01
Look at the bottom graph on GDAX. There was 100s Of sell orders at a certain price point with not enough buy orders to match it. Took 6-8 hours overnight for it to be taken down. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:56:11
It locks 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:44:40
It wont stop going up! lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:30:19
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:03:38
Contrary to what Pai said yesterday mining uses literally no internet at all.  You probably use more opening a snapchat.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:53:31
Not exactly. You basically set a buy or sell price on Gdax. Say BTC is valued at 16k but I don’t want to sell until 16.5k. Somebody or multiple people had a ton of BTC set to 16.5k. Like 1000s but nobody was buying at that price. Price won’t go past that until somebody buys all those BTC up. Which can go slowly since since he demand for BTC was way down past that price. That causes the price to drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:26
Been saying this since the big jump from 11k-12k
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:34:23
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:44:23
I'm so ready to panic buy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:36
I bought in at 11,100 and feel the same way. lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:59:15
Really tempted to buy some litecoin with my BTC with this boom right now.  I'm sure it will go back down just like BTC did a day ago but its got me checking their GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:22:43
You would need a seller for every buyer. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:16:53
I know I mined some litecoin back in 2014, probably like 30-40 and I was like “eh this is a waste of time” and know I have no idea where that shit is. At least LTC isn’t with 16k now...
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:57:11
Sometimes it’s better to just buy the market place if you’re holding for the long haul so you can be locked in to the price without waiting weeks for the money. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:18:19
I like the daily discussion and following the current trends. Like right now, its below 11,000.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:01:48
Go on the coinbase app, go to the settings and add a pic of your ID.  Once that is verified you can use GDax
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:31:41
Been waiting for a dip since 16.3 and its not looking good...Do I panic buy?!?!
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:28:55
If only coinbase reflected those prices!
