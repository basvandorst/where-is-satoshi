I'm sure feudal lords made very similar justifications to the Peasants working their fields.
"You own your allegiance to the lord of the manor because without his beneficence you wouldn't have an army to protect you nor crops to sustain you. Now go back to work filthy peasant and be sure to give me my cut. [ITS IN THE SOCIAL CONTRACT!](

Not sure you get to make that representation on behalf of everyone, especially Americans.
But nice try.

I mean, the Chinese dues with computers have invested a lot and are actually doing work to secure the chain.
Why do you think that miners don't want to see Bitcoin succeed?

The application of means to the achievement of ends?
The volition of an agent to achieve things?

Nobody gets to dictate changes. Miners have the choice to mine or not mine a given chain.
Without miners on your chain, your coin doesn't work. You can set up a system that is attractive to miners or not. If you ignore miners, how do you expect to maintain the currency over long periods?

And the only way that reward is worth anything is if bitcoin remains successful.
The whole point of Bitcoin's trustless protocol is that NOBODY is altruistic, but everyone stands to benefit when Bitcoin works.
Its absurd to pretend that miners are somehow less interested in Bitcoin's security and success than everyone else.

I'm saying that 'copying' and 'changing hands' imply two massively different relationships.
 If somebody copies something you own, you still own the copied thing. If the thing you own changes hands, you no longer own the thing.
  That's why ownership pertains to matter, and not information. Information can be non-destructively copied. If you copy something, the original 'owner' has no recourse because they have lost nothing.

Which is meaningless after the fact. If Mark Karpeles could split the head of the person who hacked MtGox after the fact, it still wouldn't bring the coins back. Hell, if they transferred them to a brain wallet it would render the inaccessible.

So what of those who don't agree to that?
If somebody takes control of your bitcoin without your permission, what are you justified to do in response?

Wait, are you implying that if you made an atom-perfect copy of me, that I would own the copy by default?
The reason I own myself is because the atoms that compose me cannot be used for other purposes. They are rivalrous. Information is not.

And where are you deriving the authority to tell the network to do that? Do you have a distinctive *right* to tell the network what to do, such that you can deny this right to others?


Well that's wonderful until a person manages to get a copy, in which case you will have *what* recourse, exactly?

I am fairly sure that the rules of physics prohibit using the same lumps of matter for two different purposes at the same time.
Yes. [I am sure.](
@_date: 2015-04-14 03:53:09


Not sure I follow. If you control a particular lump of matter to the exclusion of all others, that's 'ownership,' especially if you are the first in time to control it.
Matter, by being scarce and rivalrous, necessitates some theory of entitlement. Ownership is just recognition of said entitlement.

One large point of the article is that the private key, like any piece of information, can be infinitely copied and thus cannot be 'owned' in any legitimate sense. If somebody makes a copy of your private key, they are not denying you access to your private key. They are not rivalrous/scarce goods.
Any person who acquires a copy of your private key can access the network and alter the information on the blockchain.
If you cannot 'own' information, then you cannot be truly said to 'own' your private keys.
On what grounds would you claim you had recourse if your bitcoins were moved by somebody who had a copy of your key? What, specifically, have you 'lost?'
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:11:47


Well, yeah. Are YOU admitting that you think there should NEVER be an increase from 1mb ever?


Or blocks that grow proportionally to the growth in users, the growth in storage capacity, and improved technology?
Is that too hard to grasp?

Is interesting how you just turned clear evidence of corruption in a system into evidence that the system is not corrupt...
 Personally, doesn't the presence of this sort of corruption tend to indicate that there is probably *other* corruption in the system that simply hasn't been found out? Especially if you were *previously* working from the prior that "there is very little corruption at work."
  To be more specific:
What would we expect to see from a heavily corrupt system vs. a mostly not corrupt system? And what do we ACTUALLY see?
Or: what set of facts, if shown true, would show that the system was/was not heavily corrupt?

Nice of you to exclude yourself like that.
Larger point is that you're simultaneously saying you're in favor of a decentralized chain AND a centralized dev team for the protocol.
Why? 
@_date: 2013-09-29 05:36:34


Scammers get outed almost immediately through the work of dedicated individuals?
What are you even getting at? This is the OPPOSITE of proving your point...
Also, who was crying?
