Because in Ponzi schemes you don't repay the old investors, you only pay them a (say) 5% return on their money. You wouldn't be able to scam anyone if you simply took a new investors money and gave it all to your old investor, would you?

I assume that is total income received from taxes etc. Yes, there is a deficit, and of course when you are running a deficit you have to reissue debt when old debt matures. None of this makes what the treasury has done a Ponzi scheme.

How exactly are bitcoins going to reduce the number of mortgages needed, or loans needed for businesses. There wouldn't be any reduction as long as financing is required. The only thing it would reduce is if you needed to go into a bank to make a direct transfer to someones account (and when was the last time you did that). The infrastructure will still be required, which is why your comparison in your original post is false.

@_date: 2013-04-13 16:56:51
The comparison is not relevant because the user base for traditional fiat currencies is many orders of magnitude higher than for bitcoins. That, and the greater number of financial activities related to traditional currencies (not just transactions and currency exchanges).
It's very easy to see why you can't make a direct comparison between the two. If, on the other hand, as many people used bitcoins as traditional currencies, then the comparison would be valid.

Thats a bad analogy, I bet Mt Gox makes several thousand times what BTC Guild makes in commission (when you take into account the upkeep cost).
If Mt Gox can't be trusted, people shouldn't use them. Mt Gox aren't going to restrict the hours when their customers can use their exchange, that would be market suicide otherwise. Nor are they going to unilaterally shut themselves down because they are too successful for their own good.

You sound throughly unpleasant in that email exchange, even with the huge amount of redaction on the emails. In fact, the sheer amount of redaction says volumes.
Why the huge amount of angst regarding having an ID check? It sounds from their reply that there was an image quality issue (you say it is a typo in your dwolla account info, but whatever). You willing to send your ID once, but when they asked for a cleaner version for their verification proceses you hit the fan and berated them for asking for any form of ID in the first place. 
If you were really worried about privacy and security, why on earth didn't you just go to the bank and do a wire transfer straight to an exchange. You then eliminate the need for a payment processor, reducing the number of entities you have to deal with.

You made that comparison in your original post. What you failed to mention is the number of users of each currency




Which is why there is such a discrepancy in the power required. It is not just the power used in mining, there is all the infrastructure related to it (which you have included in the requirement for normal currency, but not for bitcoin, so it isn't even a fair comparison in that regard).


People do not have to run anything to have normal currency either. All it takes to 'mine' new fiat currency is the CPU running the printing press.

"You are demanding I turn over enough ID to make it effortless to steal my identity and everything I have in return for the 'privilege' of being able to transfer money"
Sounds like angst to me


That's fair enough. Instead of writing a two paragraph reply (the second obviously too offensive to be shown), why not just say something along the lines of "I no longer wish to use your service, and can you please arrange for my money to be refunded back to my bank account". Short and sweet.


Remember, you probably had to show ID when you opened your bank account originally. Why should it be any different for Dwolla?


Can you imagine being on the receiving end of what you put? I can't imagine how bad that email must have been for them to note how profanity-laced it was! The agent replying to your messages was probably dealing with a large number of clients on a daily basis. I've worked in customer service before, and I know how much difference the tone of an email or a phone call can make to my day. It wasn't his/her fault that you were in this situation, it was down to your mistake when you first signed up, and their policy of requiring identification.

No, only then would the fees be 0.99% (i.e. they wouldn't be "even lower"). If they do convert from BTC &gt; Dollars in order to buy more stock, using another payment processor may be more attractive.

Where is the evidence that "evil bots" are only forcing the price down, while honest trades only want the price to go up?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought it was convention that parliaments do not pass legislation which act to bind their successors, which this would propose to do (a law to prevent anti-bitcoin laws).

1 every 10 mins on average.

Sounds a lot like BTC ;)
