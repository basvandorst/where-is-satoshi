I agree completely with your first paragraph and it's what we saw years ago when mining pools became too few and too large. The communities reactions and economic pressure caused the pools to force themselves to be more distributed to prevent devaluing BTC and so damaging profits. Today we have a very healthy balance of mining pools.
In regards to PoS and DPoS used with Bitcoin. That's an age old argument that most have agreed to and those that don't have made their own Altcoins. My opinion is that PoS is an easy way for an Altcoin to start because it is very difficult to launch a coin using PoW without it being immediately vulnerable to attack. Alternatively one can hitch a ride on another PoW chain like Ethereum. It's also my opinion that PoS is a flawed system compared to PoW, most concerning of which is the speed of a crash on such a blockchain due to huge growth in liquidity as people remove their stake and sell in climates of low confidence.
Currently I believe that LN can apply pressure on miners because the higher the fees the more likely a user will want to keep their transactions on layer 2 for longer and the more people will do this the longer the fees are unreasonable. Another point is that many wallet's don't allow or easily permit (no GUI) RBF or Child Pays For Parent to give users more control over transactions. Many wallets use primitive algorithms to calculate the fee by using the mean of transaction fees rather than the medium (Some don't even let the user choose). I feel this last point is the most important cause for allowing miners to manipulate fees to the degree they have. And I doubt it's something they will get away with for much longer as wallets and users learn and adapt.

I think his looking at a wallet in its pure original form, long before HD wallets and SPVs.
Besides, if you export the keys from one wallet and bring them into another you'll have access to your coins so in then end it works.
Though Keychain I don't like much. I think Keyring would be better to avoid confusion with the chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:57:29
I suppose the lightning network will allow the users to "punish" the miners because the more they charge for fees then the less real fees people will pay by keeping transactions on layer 2 for longer.

Okay cool, so it's just a misunderstanding. Thank you, you had me worried there. Strange the links are not on coinmarketcap ��
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:53:55
Wow! That's a bit of a paradigm shift for me. I've never looked at it that way before. I've always seen the blockchain as the validation and consensus system, while the wallet is the keys to your balance. The development in SPV, pruning and HD wallets does definitely call for a reevaluate of this perspective because of the reasons you stated.
I have a feeling that one's perspective depends on their style of use. I assume from your view, you are partial to using HD and SPV wallets. While Andreas might (and myself along with others) use a full node for the most part.
Thank you for insight/explanation on your viewpoint. Although I agree with everything you've said I've not been convinced by either opinion. It's a lot to digest full of variables such as use case and discription of architecture. Reminds me of this recent debate to change "master" and "slave" to "parent" and "child" (SJW nonsense) in python. At the end of the day there should be more important changes to make than that. Perhaps this subject is the same (although less ridiculous).
Thank you again for you're explanation. I will remember these hidden details to help make sure when teaching others they will understand these nuances.
Edit: Having thought about it a little more I think it's because of wallet.dat that has subconsciously caused me to see it this way. But you're correct that the ramifications to changing the name "wallet" to "Keychain" or "Keyring" would be disingenuous for many uses cases that as you stated don't have the architecture the suggested name implies.
@_date: 2018-09-16 16:25:13
Please elaborate. Although I consider myself an expert I don't compare myself to the likes of you especially with regards to cryptography.
As someone already stated, shouldn't it be possible to retrieve this information from the blockchain? Although yes I definitely see how it could affect unconfirmed transactions it would never be recommended to hop between wallets during unconfirmed/Timelocked transactions would it (Channel closing etc)? For confirmed transactions it shouldn't be an issue other than a little extra computing to recreate all inputs/outputs? 
Perhaps this is a situation related to some of the recent or upcoming BIPs? I'd greatly appreciate learning about this in case I've misunderstood something.
P. S Thank you for all the great work you've been doing for improving Bitcoin. I'm very glad to have talented people such as yourself working to increase Bitcoins viability as a means of monetary sovereignty. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:52:36
This is what I thought, the wallet checks the Merkel root and so all the inputs and outputs are on the blockchain.

One of the most interesting things about Bitcoin is how it shows that governments and companies are not necessary to run things. It's a prime example of the principles of open source working regardless of popular belief. I think its important to teach future generations that ideas develop faster and stronger when not tied up in copyrights. All the best technologies didn't come from greed but a desire to make things better.
It might not be a tech heavy element of Bitcoin but the future generations of programmers need to take heed in the power of open source.

If the recipients wallet can't use Bech32 then they won't generate a public address of that type. I've not heard of a wallet that generates incompatible addresses (because that would make the wallet useless). In that case you may have to send funds from a new bc1 (Bech32) address to a 3 (P2SH) address or if the wallet you are using is very out of date to a 1 (legacy) address.
I hope that clears things up for you.

The best way to look at Altcoins is that they are experimental versions of Bitcoin to see if improvements can be made. They also are used for speculation. It's important to remember that Bitcoin is two things, software and a network. The Bitcoin network is by far the strongest and software can always be modified to adopt new features that are created and prove resilient during testing in an altcoin.

So many people ranted and raved over this problem last year. Proof of work can't simply be fixed by changing algorithm. At least not long term. I believe all proof of work should have to be done through P2P Pool somehow. Decentralised mining is needed to maintain a decentralised bitcoin.
If things are left the way they are governments will begin to regulate btc mining "in the interest of protecting the network" but ofc really it would be in the interest of maintaining power over money supply.
Miners may wish in 5 years they all opted to make P2P Mining mandatory while they have tax men and regulators breathing down their necks.

PSA: Be careful using circle to buy Bitcoin using non US credit or debit cards.
Credit card:
Most banks charge the transaction as Quasi Cash (payment for gambling and/or travellers cheques) and has high interest rates that can even increase for every day left unpaid.
Debit cards:
Most banks have a charge for transactions in non local currencies using a debit card. Often 4% while also giving fairly poor exchange rates as well.

I work for a very large company and have been speaking to the regional managers for almost a year about accepting Bitcoin. The general response is "We are too large to take risks like that.". Now at our next meeting I can say "We may be a large company but certainly not as big as Microsoft who accept Bitcoin.".
So in short this news is actually going to make the argument of accepting Bitcoin as too high risk for large companies completely impossible. This in my mind is a major breakthrough!

Sadly I don't have the technical knowledge of such technology to offer any solutions. Not to mention this is all such a new problem that there has not been much time to find out how to solve the problem.
But I can say with little doubt that as long as mining doesn't become more decentralised (something I worry is somewhat unlikely due to greed) then much of the liberating possibilities of bitcoin will be hampered down by governments and big business.
My only hope for some time now has been a decentralised mining system for bitcoin. In the years of following bitcoin it's the only thing I see as a real weakness.

So much hate for PayPal (and for many just reasons) but I think they will play an important roll in making bitcoin mainstream. 
Imo PayPal will integrate bitcoin by offering an almost identical service as Coinbase and Bitpay. But it's worth noting they have to remain competitive so they will promote Bitcoin saying "accept Bitcoin and make big savings on transactions without the risk!" this will lead to almost every current PayPal customer now actually wanting to use bitcoin. It will be a huge turning point essentially making Bitcoin mainstream.
They will also roll out a wallet system but I believe it will be very simple because PayPal will want to avoid confusion with exchange rates. PayPal is a payment company and they are going to focus on competing with Coinbase and Bitpay most of all. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 10:36:36

That's my point, it's not stable. Bitcoin tapers off gradually. Dogecoin rewards the first year investors far far more than those after. Because Dogecoin will be printed more and more forever its by definition a ponzi scheme. If nobody wanted to buy anymore Dogecoin after the first year it's value would drop more and more until it's worthless because there would always be so many more coins added every year, forever. Without new investors Dogecoin will begin to lose value over time. Making it a terrible store of value, one of the main purposes of Money.

@_date: 2014-02-04 11:19:27
I wouldn't be surprised, if you think about it Dogecoin is really a ponzi scheme. Inflationary currencies need new investors all the time to support those already holding. If nobody else wanted to get Dogecoin then the price would start dropping and dropping as more and more coins are made. Eventually becoming worthless. It's also a ponzi scheme because it rewards people in the first year of investing most and the rest all lose out. Bitcoin at least gave years of slower growth to allow people to get in before the boat had sailed. You also know that even if you are late to the show in bitcoin you still stand a good chance because of deflation. With Dogecoin you can just can't catch up to those who invested in even the first year because it's value keeps dropping and you just can't keep up.

@_date: 2014-02-04 02:56:54
Well Dogecoin is extremely inflationary, one of the main reasons people like Bitcoin is because it is deflationary. This difference is astronomical and overlooking it shows a grave misunderstanding in economics.
The other enormous difference is the size of bitcoins network hashing power. It's that power that gives it security and Dogecoin is a very long way from being as secure.
Finally the amount of support and projects being worked on for bitcoin completely overshadows development in Dogecoin. All you have to do is look at the type of people investing in Dogecoin and those investing in Bitcoin. While Dogecoin is being supported by youngsters and those dabbling in the idea of crypto currencies. Those investing in bitcoin are involved in multi billion dollar companies working with some of the world's finest minds.
What's happening with Dogecoin is fascinating. What we see here is the network effect of a celebrity applied to a network of property ownership. It's something I believe has never happened before but it's fairly easy to predict its future. As it's financial drive is especially inflationary it will fail to reap financial rewards to investors once the novelty of the applied celebrity wears off. This means that it's growth begins to slow and will fall down back in on itself and become almost worthless. This will be emphasised by watching bitcoins value rise faster and faster in comparison.
I know this will seem arrogant and that many may disagree with me but Dogecoin is just an interesting phase in crypto currencies and by no means is it comparable to Bitcoin. By all means disagree with me if you wish but I'm used to people disagreeing with my opinions, like with the PC, the Internet, P2P, MP3 players and media streaming. Oh yes and Bitcoin. I'm used to people saying "you're wrong" or "You're crazy" but I always somehow ended up being correct 5 to 10 years later.
I give Dogecoin a 5% survival chance in 10 years and 0.00000001% of replacing Bitcoin.

No I agree with you. Btc mining will become much more centralised as big companies such as Intel and AMD get involved. But financial institutions will also want to get join in and this wouldn't just be for America. If bitcoin doesn't develop some catastrophic problem (that seems very unlikely considering all the people checking the code and having a financial incentive to keep it secure) then "long term" it won't just be mining companies playing a roll in the mining pie chart but countries themselves.
I foresee that if bitcoin carries on as it has been, then in 10 years countries themselves will be fighting over blocks as it will almost be a visual chart of wealth creation. Governments don't really fight wars with guns anymore but rather with regulations, sanctions and financial manipulation.
My hope is that the mining community is forward thinking and makes itself as decentralised and resistant to government manipulation as possible before it's too late.

When someone commits fraud its not the shop that loses out but the bank. But the bank doesn't want to take a loss so they take measures to mitigate the losses. They do so by passing the loss to the paying consumer because the shop has to take these costs and then pass it onto customers and the consumers suffers directly through costs such as annual service fees etc.
Banks make enormously large amounts of money from commerce (with credit/debit card services) at the expense of the consumer. Most of this is in the name of fraud or improving the service to reduce fraud (a complete lie as they make most if their profit through "fraud prevention measures" so have no financial incentive to stop it). 
Customers gain a lot more than they lose from the death of charge backs. Merchants will have to take far more care to maintain a reputation (so better service for all) and the consumer will be more careful with their money because if they make a mistake its their problem and not just handed over to everyone else to deal with in credit card fees etc.

There is a fairly simple explanation, if you are starting a business that uses Bitcoin chances are that you need a fairly large amount. Your options for obtaining a large quantity of Bitcoins is limited.
I'm sure there are more business ventures in need of Bitcoins than the Bitcoins available at the auction. I would expect some of these entities stopped buying in wait of the auction to try their luck. This could be the reason the price has been softly dropping as the auction grew closer.
But if these entities failed to obtain their Bitcoins from the auction, now they have no choice but to purchase from the few available avenues all of which are strongly connected to the mainstream markets. 
Just because the winners will be announced on the 30th doesn't mean that those with friends in high places don't know what's going on. Insider trading is obviously taking place either due to incompetence (like the leaked auction email addresses) or dishonesty (pick any of the scandals the US government is involved with just the last 6 months).

Think of it this way, the wallet.dat file is your key. And your bitcoins are kept in the block chain like a safe. The safe can be accessed anywhere you have access to the Internet. But to gain access to your coins you need your key = your wallet.dat file.
There is more to it but if you remember this main concept then it will all start to become clearer. I would strongly advise doing more research to make sure you don't make any mistakes though because it could cost you if you don't know what you're doing.

First of all hardly anyone knows about Bitcoin still, just this Friday I had to explain it to a banker who had never heard of it. As little as 15% have heard of Bitcoin and only 1% understand it.
Secondly investing and expecting to make money in a year or even months is a fools game for investments like Bitcoin. If you want to make money in a few months, invest in what everyone else is and as that fresh money comes in it slowly pumps up your prior investment. You'll make meager profits but that's because your just one sheep in a heard.
You see people do this all the time, invest on the rise and give up on the downtrend. People did the same in 2011 when it hit $30 and look where they would stand now if only they thought in years rather than months.
The important thing about investing in Bitcoin is to understand what it is and what it's designed to replace. If you study and research this carefully from both sides of the fence then you should know if it's an investment for you or not and that it's not about making money short term but protecting yourself from possible problems in the future.

It can't reach zero. There will always be someone wanting to pay something. It's the world's first crypto currency. It will be like owning an old Comador 64. It will have historic value to someone. Wouldn't you think it cool if you could tell your friends you owned coins from the first minted currency in the world? Bitcoin is that in digital form.

Yes that's why I recommend this with some hesitation. But I also feel the curse of knowledge may be clouding our judgment on the initial outlook of Bitcoin from someone completely new. What's this QR code? How do send and receive? How many addresses can I have? How can I make a paper wallet and so on.
Maybe just at the very start it could be helpful to play with for an hour or so before moving around real money. 
I also recommend this on the grounds that for some 1 or 2 dollars is actually a lot of money and for others it is hard to aquire Bitcoin. Xbox gamers can often be young and unable to purchase Bitcoin online, while for some 5 dollars is actually a lot to them. For those people this may be useful.

It's funny how today people consider interest a must for a financial system but in the past it was considered evil and outlawed across the world even through religious texts.
It's very important that people learn that interest is a form of slavery and is immoral. Loans should be seen as an investment and the profits should come from the successes of the venture invested in and not condemning the person taking the loan that could grow to a point where his or her life is spent only trying to pay back the debt only several times over.

The monetary system we use today is a ponzi scheme. That's why they can't taper without the whole thing collapsing. I'm saying Dogecoin is the same because it's always going to be printing more and more. This means more users are needed to maintain its value. Something cannot hold its value if more and more of it are being created all the time. Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme because there will eventually be no more being made. It is deflationary as a whole. Thinking short term like you are (4 years for bitcoin or 30 years for Global Fiat currency system) is silly because it's not a long enough a time frame.
Inflationary currencies have never worked as well as deflationary currencies. The main reason deflationary currencies don't last "forever" is because wars cost too much and it's cheaper to just start printing funny money to pay for it. Unfortunately people often being short sighted fail to see the madness of making this transition, mainly because they are being influenced by their government by the threat of some enemy and/or not winning a war.
Shortsighted thinking is the source of almost all of mankind's blunders and sadly it is something we still have happening often today. I honestly cannot look back at history and say that Dogecoin has much chance of surviving long term. You are free to tell me I'm wrong but we shall see in 10 years how things turn out.

Nice work  this is a good move. Starcraft already is showing signs of a growing understanding for bitcoin. A move like this could get the ball rolling fairly fast. It's worth noting that going for SC2 could add to understanding of bitcoin across other blizzard games. World of warcraft, Hearthstone, SC2 and Diablo 3 totals up to an extremely large potential audience. And then with TBs passion for the team he would most likely take greater interest in Bitcoin and that opens up the possibility for a huge amount of coverage.
As for Lol and Dota 2, I think a lot more work would be needed to gain traction there (as SC2 already has a small bitcoin scene) and (I could be wrong) but blizzard tend to mess up their leagues a bit so SC2 depends more on outsider tournaments. Especially in South Korea where the local government is being fairly Bitcoin friendly. Dota and Lol seem to have their official big tournaments organised by their company so it may be harder to make an impact if they dislike bitcoin.
I could be wrong about these last comments as I'm not a very big follower of these eSports but it's the impression I have been given over the last few years. But two thumbs up to this idea.

It won't happen because of bitcoin. It will happen because one of the few major banks requires a bail in costing its citizens huge amounts of money. When it happens to a large enough bank, say RBS then it will cause ripples throughout the world just as it did in 2008.
It's one thing when it happens to little Cyprus and another thing when it's a major player in the world economy. Most people are unaware how the banking system works and will not be running to withdraw from their bank until it's too late.
There will be a lot of unhappy people in the next ten years because there is little chance of avoiding another meltdown for that long. Wealth disparity is growing and most people feel that they just don't really see it. But that's because governments invent fancy things like CPI to replace RPI to hide the real figures. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 11:34:05
History contradicts you I'm afraid. Economic collapse and/or wealth transfers don't happen very slowly normally. I suggest reading something that looks at more than the last 40 years of "history" and go back at least 400 years.
P.S my favorite part about bitcoin is its removal of power governments have over money and it's limited supply. No country in history has been able to sustain wars for any great length of time that was paid for with hard assets because nobody has enough gold/silver etc to pay for wars that last tens on years. That's why governments use Fiat to keep their wars going because they can just keep printing more to keep funding wars.
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:11:25
You're very correct! You are making a very valid point. I think the difference though is that at least people know it will eventually come to an end. We all know that bitcoin is limited in supply. This adds psychological context to its value. This is very important because it makes people want to save. In an inflationary currency people are constantly wanting to spend as the value falls. Something designed to lose value over time is a poor method of storing value. In a consumer world without finite resources it may work in the long run. But this is not the reality of our situation so using an inflationary currency cannot work in the long run. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 10:48:46
That's a fair idea. At least if people see bitcoin funding a tournament they might think "oh maybe the CEO of bitcoin didn't commit suicide?" It's a chance to educate. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:49:39
1. This is somewhat true but as nobody runs Bitcoin it doesn't have a PR team to make this change. Instead it will happen over time and most importantly, when the price increases enough.
2. Trade volume is low because bitcoin is considered by many to be an investment not simply a payment system. Also the price has dropped and so people feel poorer with their bitcoin holdings. As the price goes up spending and volume will increase. The last few months are nothing more than the calm before the next storm.
3. Those that choose to accept BTC at physical locations are doing so because of the potential savings and marketing the change gives them. You cannot simply expect online stores to want to take advantages of the savings made by using BTC. Again there is no company that is trying to control the growing adoption of BTC. It's just going to happen in the organic way it has been.
4. It's a shame I should have to explain this to someone who works at wallstreet. It's basic economics, supply and demand. If BTC was to go mainstream then that means higher demand. Higher demand leads to higher increases in the price of something with limited supply. Look at bitcoin as an early IPO not as a currency like a euro or Yen. The market is deciding the price not self important men in suits. Try to remember that as the price starts to rise speculators such as yourself jump in trying to make money and these weak handed day traders after a fast profit cause the wild price swings. They are also the ones who lose out while those that believe in the idea of BTC have faired well the last 4 years. Finally alt Coins are little more than a speculative game and experiments. Do not forget Bitcoin is software, if something cool comes along in an alt coin then it can be implemented to Bitcoin also. Software can adapt and change to suit its needs. Considering how much money, time and effort invested in BTC it is foolish to think some new coin will come along and steal the massive network effect bitcoin has massed together. Its like Google + trying to replace Facebook. Bitcoin is a software and a network. Software can adapt and change when needed and the network behind Bitcoin is the most powerful network ever conceived by mankind. 
6. Are you unaware as to how much debt these banks are in? How corrupt the economic system is right now? Finally once again supply and demand, if these firms would try to buy all of bitcoin then the price of Bitcoin would shoot up and cause a massive rally.

I thought many of the coins were caught and traced to a large amount. If the funds were being spent over the time of running Mt gox wouldn't we not have seen all those coins start moving as it choked its final breaths? Since Karples already spent most of these coins according to your theory then why would they all start moving at once just before the bust?
Also I'm not sure where the bots fit in to your theory that were mostly responsible for the large price hike. It seems that Mt Gox deliberately pushed the price up to increase its reserves to make the exit more profitable. Plus the more Fiat on the line the less focus on the actual Bitcoins. 
I'm not sure of the details I wasn't one of the people tracking the coins. But if I recall correctly the coins started moving within the last weeks of the exchange implying these coins where stolen together and not because they had been spent over the years of operating the exchange. 
I also think Karples was one of the only people involved in creating the exchanges infrastructure. If this is the case it seems pointless to ask the prime suspect to "investigate" into what happened.
I agree with parts of this theory, it's very likely that some of the Mt gox funds were used this way. But I can't agree that that explains ALL those missing Bitcoins. I think something far more sinister and deliberate happened.

11-10 months before the last two halving was a great time to buy and I believe the same is so this time. The past shows we will see a steady rise in the coming months and about 6-4 months before halving a volatile bubble will appear and settle around 10% below the peak and 4-5 months later the lack of new coins squeeze up the price and then we find ourselves in a FOMO stage.
I believe we will see 20k again in 7-9 months time a correction to around 17k and then a gentle rise up and up till around 30k when FOMO starts and we visit 100k and find ourselves in crash territory to "lows" of 40k. Less something left field comes along, I'm pretty confident it will play out this way.

Have you used Bitcoin and a credit card before? While the credit card required giving all you personal information to access your funds, a bitcoin transaction doesn't give any personal information to access your funds. You send, not grant access to funds.

Although true this is not in the spirit of what Satoshi wanted. Although s/he wanted to increase the block size as needed s/he also addressed that s/he did not want the Blockchain to grow too large for the average user, suggesting a system s/he referred to as "Pruning" the blockchain of unnecessary data.
The community has had more progress in optimising block size and creating parallel technologies than in the original intention of removing unnecessary data from the Blockchain.
Primarily, Satoshi clearly disliked the centralised system Fiat currencies are using today and wanted a decentralised payment system to take the power away from the few and restore it to the many. I'm sure s/he envisioned aiding the world and not just wealthy countries. 
Having a blockchain so large it becomes only something the wealthy can maintain is unequivocally counter to the true purpose of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:18:47
I think the problem is you live in a part of the world with a stable currency and financial freedom. Unfortunately this isn't the case for the majority of the world's population and so you'll struggle to see it's value as a use case. But what you will see is that the system will enable things impossible before such as micro transactions and decentralised businesses. The possibility of paying someone a thousandth of a dollar to draw a pixel on a public board was impossible until this technology was created. You'll also see smart contracts used to represent assets because it's cheaper to manage than a database.
Perhaps you can't see it yet yourself because you trust the system you use today, but there are others around the world who don't, people in Venezuela are surviving thanks to Bitcoin.
Finally do not make the common mistake of associating Bitcoin to currencies, it is not debt based and is consistently Deflationary and thus does not suffer the same course of a currency based on debt that can be inflationary OR Deflationary. Monetary strain comes from uncertainty, while a fiat currency is clandestine as to its supply, Bitcoin is completely transparent so there is no change in direction (inflation or deflation) but simply a change in velocity. This fundamental difference means it is impossible to compare the two like for like.

Never really understood this view. If the vast majority chose to move to chain B while the majority of miners remain with chain A. Then they are simply mining coins that nobody wants. You can mine any coin you like, but the demand for the coin (on the right chain) is what makes it worth mining to begin with.
I don't understand how people don't see this as it's simple supply and demand. Maybe I'm missing something? Even if only 25 percent of miners move with the majority of users there would still be plenty of hashing power even though block times will be slower. And the miners will reap much larger rewards in fees and as those coins become more valuable because they belong on the popular chain.
It's like a centralised version of Bitcoin made by a government or bank. It's all very well to do your own thing but it's pointless if nobody's wants to use it instead of something else. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 08:00:48
The larger the block size the more transactions it can hold. Thus the more spam required to fill a block. Therefore the more expensive it is to clog up the block chain to delay other transactions.
It's very simple and doesn't require a change in fees because the attacker has to just keep throwing more and more money at the attack to sustain it, eventually they'll run out off funds.

It's open source software. It's unlikely for a proprietary rival to work since it requires a huge amount of trust. So almost any rival crypto currency must be open source and thus any innovation in a rival currency can simply be added to the Bitcoin software.

I would argue XRP fails to meet the requirements to be called a cryptocurrency. The name originates from the cryptography required to create blocks using SHA256 not public/private key handshakes that exist in many already existing technologies. XRP is a database and is looking to be an attack on the decentralised nature of what the technology stands for.
Sites rank coins by their market cap. This allows the creators of XRP to artificially inflate their dominance by increasing supply without introducing it to the markets. I recommend avoiding looking at market cap alone, as Volume is an extremely important metric.

Wouldn't it allow everyone to get a more average feel for the price regardless of situation? For eg when all the DDOS attacks happened on Mt Gox months back, people would still be able to see the average trade rate. I suppose it would smooth over the bumps in the market, it could make the price swings softer and be harder to manipulate. At the moment the price feels centralized because it depends on Mt Gox. A distributed consensus may be better?

I fully agree that a system like this is needed. I've been in a lot of talks trying to come up with new potential government structures that would need a system like this. The only problem is that every time the system would need an issuing body to prevent duplicate voting from a group/individual.
You see the problem is that you need a system that ensures a person can never vote more than once. An opensource system like this cannot prevent this by any means we know of today. Currently it would require a central body to issue voter keys and this is not ideal as a small group of people should never be trusted long term.
Making it hard to vote multiple times is one thing but it needs to be mathematically improbable instead. Figure out a way to do that and you'll get a Nobel Prize I'm sure.

The bullion market is where the Gold markets tell a true story and lately its one that implies that something very fishy is going on.
I by no means am implying I know whats going on. My point would be that a lot of people including myself are confused by the facts and figures and starting to wonder just what exactly is happening to the Bullion market.

You understand that controlling too large a portion of the network undermines the security of bitcoin and thus damaging its value. Are you suggesting a company would invest all the time and resources into making a loss? A company engaged in BTC mining would not have customers to upset in the same way as say Walmart or Microsoft. 
You also cannot point a gun at a corporation and expect results. A corporation is not a person regardless of the wording used in law to define a corporation. Governments don't have the money or power to undermine theses big companies. I remind you (since I assume the country in question is the USA) that the government has almost no power only responsibility as congress is the body with the power to pass laws and they are a lobby group funded by corporations.

Argh I keep trying to type a comment but I can't see how to avoid it becoming an essay. This is an extremely complicated subject.
I will instead just say that money is a store of wealth, it's what you can buy with it that makes it valuable. Bitcoin is different to money, it's more similar to gold.
I belive the value of bitcoin will go up and the value of other currencies will go down. Both at high speeds. If the governments wait too late they won't be able to afford the attack if their dollars become almost worthless. If they attack now or soon, then a replacement will appear and the government will be simply trying to push water up hill as more innovations are implemented to crypto currencies.
If a currency experiences inflation at high speeds people lose faith in its value rendering it worthless.

This idea has floated around before. You get one argument in particular, governments like to control their money system. The thing is that not all governments focus on power and some want to do what is best for their countries future, those honest governments may well consider bitcoin as a national currency.
But there is the risk that other countries like the US could play games with bitcoin at the cost of the said country.
I see not one country but several countries banding together in doing this in order to be more resistant to foreign manipulation. Like the euro only without the inherent flaws of Fiat, so maybe it would work.

Thinking deeper I eventually came to a conclusion I have not seen and is a little against the grain to the usual opinions I have seen. It is common to see people say that Bitcoin will not be allowed to become its full potential. This is then backed by the opinion that, "the current system makes the rich stay rich and they wont let that be changed."
Thing is that Banks tend to be owned by people that understand the economy, in order to do so you must see the flaw that it cannot be sustainable forever. The Banks also answer to far more powerful people who behind the lines control their local economies.
I think we may underestimate the overwhelming powers that be, they know that the current economic model is beginning to show its fatal flaw. And I think they consider their fiat currency to be a "long con" to the public and now that it is ending they will amass their wealth to buy investments immune to economic collapse. So what ever happens next, be it Bitcoin or something else, they will still have their assets and thus most of their wealth will go unscathed by the change.
We are talking about people who manipulate countries to war and use media as a means to assert the opinions they wish onto the public. To consider them unable to know when to adapt and adjust when fighting a losing battle seems wrong to me.

The strongest element to this system in my opinion is the ability to remove the black and white and allow a full gradient in political voting. At the moment it often is one extreme or the other. A system like this would allow the removal of parties and instead allow individuals for each role to be elected. None of this "You can be head of Transport because you're my friend" business and instead be given that job because of proof in ability instead. Also those who can be elected for a certain role would have to have considerable experience in that field.
So as an example, lets say a head of medical research is needed. A pool of the greatest minds in this field would be put together. This list could be as long as say 200 people. Then at random a computer would pick five that the public could then decide on who of the five they want for the job.
This would also then require full transparency with government funding that will be open to the public. This will prevent the elected person for a department being held responsible for lack of change due to negligence when it was actually lack of funding.
I personally would think it better to have it so no official apart from the "public face" of a government be voted for by anyone. WARNING this is going to sound outrageous but I am not a conventionally minded person.
There have been tests most recently in Italy I believe where completely random people would be asked to run certain departments of a government for a year in a program. These people would have no personal interest in the job they are assigned to and as such although lacking in comprehensive knowledge they are completely unbiased and as a result they are able to perform the role in a fair manner.
I personally think this could be streamlined to improve productivity while also maintaining the lack of potential corruption. If a pool of people, particularity educators and spokesmen/women with a broad understanding of a particular field, like the environment, medical care, traffic management and so on was developed, these people could be called upon at random for a term almost like jury duty. They would then act as the spokesman for their field during this time explaining the subjects that the public would be voting for. Almost like a two sided TED debate. From there the public will be able to make a choice after showing a "proof of work" (that they listened and understood fully the purpose of the vote) to prevent ignorant votes.
The only person that would be elected by the people directly would be the "face" of their governing body. This would obviously be a popularity contest of sorts among intellectuals while also someone the people of a country feels most represents them. So yes this could well mean that Jonny Depp could be the face of America while the face of the UK could be Stephan Fry or John Cleese. It may sound ridiculous initially but I ask to remind you that the "face" of the governing body is simply the spokesman, they will not control or dictate. They will simply address their respective nation or other nations with the conses opinion of their governing body.
Hope that didn't fry anybodies brain cells with rage or disbelief. I know it sounds outrageous but I have been considering a new way for political structure for some time and trying to maintain a corruption free democracy would require some serious restructuring changes.
It saddens me greatly that after so many centuries of changes humanity has gone through, our use of government has changed so little. The system we use today was made in a time before all the technology we have today. I personally believe that the reason for lack of change is a simple one that stares us in the face especially in recent times. Those in power today are not in power for the good of their country, but rather for the good of themselves.
In my opinion a politician is not someone who should be considered of great stature or someone of power. A politician is a servant to the people elected for their morals and integrity. A politician is supposed to be a servant to the people. This I feel is key to a functioning democracy and yet it is currently not the case in almost all countries.

From what I have heard the amounts these businesses are transferring are not very large. Perhaps the exchange from BTC to Somali fiat could be done through bureau de change services? Alternatively its worth noting that Somalia is right next to Kenya and so a currency without boarders may find its way back and forth via the exchange of goods and services for BTC, Somali Shillings, Kenyan Shilling and M-PESA. 
Edit: Oh wait I am not saying the customers of the service would use BTC, I mean the company that supplies the service could use BTC as a means of moving the GBP value into Somalia etc via BTC and then exchange the BTC for local fiat.

That's okay, people said I was crazy and wrong three years ago when buying bitcoin. You can't get ahead of the herd if you can't think for yourself. My advice is to take your education not too seriously and realise a masters in finance or any subject is little more than a masters in current opinion on a subject matter. Much of what we thought was fact 100 or even 50 years ago is definitely not common opinion today. Mankind has a track record of over estimating its intellect.

It is my opinion that GDP and profit growth cannot continue to grow as it has forever. Eventually the bubbles will burst, shares in the way Apple had with no dividends is a prime example. People put their money in stocks to fight inflation. This means that the markets are over priced. Just a mention of cutting QE shows a picture of what is really going on. Also remember bitcoin or at least something similar could be used as a means of passing ownership in shares and even deeds. The technology has a lot of potential yet to be imagined yet alone exploited.

Looking forward to being able to use this on Andriod, not used iOS for years and unless Apple have a personality transplant I doubt I will ever go back. Beware as Apple have decided to ban Bitcoin Wallet apps so are hardly Bitcoin friendly.
On the Android app, it would be great to have a widget to display the mean price. I was just talking about this in another thread. I would love an easy way to see the average price across all major exchanges at a glance rather than calculate it myself to find the overall health of Bitcoin.

I was thinking this also. In the UK ASDA mature their beef for 15 days before sale. Tesco mature beef for between 18 to 28 days.
Meat is best if its matured because the muscle fibers contract during rigamortis. The storage allows for the proteins to break down allow the muscle to lose and become tender.
I'm surprised they want to sell high quality beef but are not going to allow for the meat to mature. Strange...

My greatest concerns now is how dependant on Mt Gox the Bitcoin Market is. I worry that if something goes badly wrong with Mt Gox the growing userbase of bitcoin will be hit hard. It's funny how people flock to BTC because it is decentralised only to all turn the same exchange, creating although lesser but similar problems once again.
It would be within the interest of Mt Gox and Bitcoin for Mt Gox to close for a short while to upgrade their servers. Allowing people to learn alternative exchanges and then when Mt Gox comes back online its ready to handle the demand that is round the next corner.

It's not really that much tbh. The estimated value of all the gold mined is a little over 8 trillion USD. $500,000 gets you a small slice of the pie. A gold coin is little more than a breadcrumb.

Back up the block chain and this can save you a lot of time. As much as I want to help the network and run as a node I simply can't stand bitcoin qt. Been using bitcoin qt for three years but this summer it broke the last straw. The data was corrupted (again) and the makeshift shortcut to redirect the save location for the block chain somehow broke and once corrected... It crippled my PC to safe mode. It took two hours trying to get it running again and now I'm going to have to spend ages doing a full reinstall now to get things running smoothly.
I recommend making a Coinbase account. It's what I moved to and I'm very happy so far. I'm sure that eventually bitcoin qt or another version of the client will become not only more stable but also feature friendly. But for the time being bitcoin qt requires above average computer wizardry.

Try to bring home the fact that Bitcoin is more similar to Gold than a modern day currency like the Dollar. Like gold it is valuable because it is very limited in supply but unlike gold it can be exchanged with great ease all around the world.
Edit: Plus if they say its a bubble, explain how as the value of an economy grows the stronger it becomes. As more people trust their wealth with Bitcoin, the less likely the it will crash. One of the reasons why the fiat currencies are losing value faster now is exactly because so many people no longer trust Bankers and Governments. People trust Bitcoin because its protocol is open to the world to see and anyone with the programming knowledge can understand it.

And I'm sure SR is able to make more money allowing it to protect itself better. Not to mention it is likely that alt SRs will start to pop up once it becomes clearer how to really make BTC transactions Anonymous.
The most important thing to note is that SR holds a very small share of Bitcoins transactions. You are effectively waiting for an unlikely event that may only bring the price down by $10 when the price could have reached $500+. Don't buy BTC in the hope to gain a few $ unless you want to Day Trade, something I don't think you are in any position to do as you don't seem to know enough about the market.

1) People have been losing their heads about this for some time. I remember the claims that the "current proof of work will not survive the year!". Well how's that turned out? Satoshi said "essentially one cpu 1 vote." that does not mean he thought it would ever actually be 1 CPU 1 vote. Botnets wouldn't allow this. The charts for bitcoins being mined will change significantly over the next few years. Companies like AMD, Intel etc will get in on the action. Eventually I think it likely that we will see international regulations for bitcoin mining to prevent undermining the system. Just remember that the last time it became a problem it was resolved an a few days.
2) I assure you the energy used is much less than the expended energy in running current payment systems. Unlike other systems efficiency is key for profit. Banks don't care about things like how much pollution is made by a persons commute to work and so on. All a Bitcoin miner worries is energy input to coin output. It's easier to keep it green.

I think the change makes sense from what I've understood. I think the main issue was that people felt the change was being pushed in without much talk about why and how the change is to be implemented.
Bitcoin being very community driven means that the community have to feel involved and informed. They flee the central banking system because of its lack of transparency. Bitcoin QT needs to remain as transparent as possible because so many people involved in bitcoin value openness and honesty.
I recommend trying to be as honest and open with your feelings towards bitcoin and the client. Even if people do not agree with your views they will trust you all the more for your lack of compromise to bring as open as possible. They don't call it open source for nothing ;)

a·the·ism  
The theory or belief that God does not exist.
I think the issue is you are taking the use of the word "belief" and using it as an external representation of the world rather than its true meaning.
be·lief  
An acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists.
Something one accepts as true or real; a firmly held opinion or conviction.
Just because an atheist believes there is no god, doesn't mean that there is no god, just as a christian believing in God doesn't mean that god exists.

I think I understand what you are saying now. That the belief in somethings existence is different to disbelieving it from an emotional perspective. I will take a wild guess to assume that you are an Atheist and possibly living in a situation where traditionally religious people are in close proximity to you. It could explain the strong "stance" you hold towards "belief" in particular towards Atheism.
But my use of the word belief is for the very foundations of what a person believes in. Something that a person feels is extremely important to them and helps guide their choices on a daily basis even if subconsciously. Morals, Family Values and Tastes are all very important belief systems and function in many similar ways to religion.
I refer to belief in a macro level, as to explore the complexities of every individuals views is a waste of time. Belief is not only about Gods vs Science. Its about what makes a person who they are.

I think this will be a very strange bubble as the bigger the bubble gets, the stronger it becomes. The more money invested into it, the more people want it to succeed. The increase in its value better the perception of the currency, thus the more businesses willing to accept it. More transactions taking place for goods and services, the more stable a currency can become.

This makes perfect sense but I'm a little confused as to the gap between the Dwalla account issue and the price going up now days later. Seems a little slow to me...
Plus you're right there has been lots of good news for Bitcoin but... Well the really big news recently imo is the WebMoney accepting Bitcoin. That opened up a lot of possibilities and yet the price change didn't happen. And then now about a week later it starts shifting... I can't figure it out. I am also extremely suspicious of the stability about 3 or 4 days ago.
Even with the issue with stocks/shares looking very vulnerable the last couple days, I don't think that many people would move to investing in Bitcoin especially as the majority of price drops were US stock related while the rest of the world only saw a couple percent. And with the main avenue for US citizens to fund money into their Mt Gox account being in a mess right now, I assume the US has a smaller impact on Mt Gox prices than usual...
Argh this is very confusing, this recent price rise suggests something is moving volume and large amounts while remaining hidden and indisposed.

Thank you for the great response. I think I understand... You're saying that Quantum Computers process data via brute force, bombarding a problem with possible answers. ASIC works by trying to methodically find the answer with the least effort and time. It might not be as powerful but it's more effective.
Is that correct?
Although this sounds fairly comforting I must admit that to me it resembles the discovery of say atomic fission. Initially an unwieldy creature, complicated and very difficult to control. But eventually harnessed and its potential exploited with great efficiency to all manner of ends.

This “lets remove proof of work” stuff sounds completely nonsensical. Almost fear mongering, saying something like this as it completely undermines the psychological element of bitcoin. We have seen it before, BTC Guild grows too big and so droves of people leave and new mining pools appear. It makes no sense for someone to invest so much effort in mining that they then gain too much network hashing power. The same would apply to ASIC mining, a company making ASIC miners would never want to control too large a share of hashing power because then the networks security would be compromised devaluing bitcoin.
Argh! Maybe I’m missing something but this certainly is not something I am worried about. And we want and need ASIC mining hardware out to the masses and as soon as possible. Quantum computing appears to be making some extremely large jumps of late and we need a massive powerhouse network to become resistant to this. If D Wave manages to make progress quicker than the ASIC network evolution then that could be a serious problem.

His actually not too far wrong, it's commonly thought that the total wealth in usd is 20T. But I've been thinking about this stuff for a couple years now. This approach is incorrect because it won't take into account the shift in value of global wealth. 
All the changes in stock/share values if btc became global would be incalculable. It is fair to say many things have a value they are not worthy of right now. Best example is Apple, shares pay no dividends and a company is not forever so it is a terrible store of wealth compared to traditional stores of wealth with physical assets. Such dangerous investment is common place when a Fiat currency is in place. It's uncommon if the currency is limited in supply. 
Values are inflated so much so it is impossible to know true global wealth as speculative wealth is now tied to actual wealth because of the Fiat system we use. It's all a speculative bubble, that includes even gold. 
You see if bitcoin becomes a global currency that is designed to replicate golds scarcity, gold will have a major competitor that is far more portable and divisible. Gold will drop in value if bitcoin becomes global. Finally gold can be used in industry instead of dust accumulators in a safe.

Anonymity is not the only benefit of using bitcoin. People are moving to bitcoin because they do not trust Banks and Governments. They don't like banks taking huge cuts in transfers. They hate the idea of governments coming along and taking away their savings. They dislike that QE lowers their spending power more and more. Bitcoin is designed to solve or lessen these problems. If bitcoin goes mainstream people will not be storing their life savings on their personal computers just like people do not store gold bars under their mattress. 
What we see of bitcoin now is hardly what we will see in 5 - 10 years if bitcoin succeeds. The Internet was completely different in its first few years to what it is today. The BTC protocol has third party escrow built into it because bitcoin is not as fast as cash and anonymity comes at the cost of occasional shady activities. The P2P exchange system within BTC is designed to use companies like PayPal to facilitate instant transactions without risk to vendor or customer.

Seems someone made a sell of 5k btc. That flooded the market for a short while causing a fair dip in price. Then day traders panic and sell causing the price to drop even more. Then panic spreads from better traders wanting to profit from those trying to sell at low prices. Exchanges start to lag with all the chaos but after a 4 hours the flood of cheap sell prices are all eaten up and price is restored to something similar to before.
Also people can't move money so easily on the weekend because of the banks. This means that most weekends prices drop often by 5-15%.

0% interest rates, Stocks are a bubble, Shares are a bubble, Housing market is a bubble and Gold and Silver prices are a mess with Paper Gold dumping and its becoming extremely difficult to own physical in the west. Not to mention it's hardly a practical method of storing wealth due to extremely expensive storage fees, almost all sensible Physical Gold investors now store it in private vaults.
So I ask you, what on earth might these magical new safe havens for investments be? Sure the simple minded may have forgotten what the situation is because the "mainstream" media isn't talking about it anymore but I sincerely doubt that someone with the ability to so shake such a financial stick is one of these foolish people.

You're both right, OP is correct in saying we will see an upward hill over the next 3 months. Bitcoin is doing so well after what happened in April that it will add to its credibility a lot.
You're looking at it from a more macro perspective but maybe not taking into account enough the shape of the global economy. Initial burst this year was because of Cyprus, following growth was because of speculation.
The next bubble will most likely be due to similar reasons. As the global economy coughs and groans bitcoin will grow stronger each time. Nobody knows what the cause will be for the next bubble especially as the possible reasons are very numerous.

I have been tip posting on other forums. Not so much for the content but the help people give. Eg two days ago I was getting help for recovering some corrupt data files. I thanked those who helped and asked for their bitcoin address to tip them as thanks. None used it this time but it spreads the word.
Think tipping each other in new social circles is the best way to spread bitcoin. I don't even have a mining rig I just use my current account that I keep topping up for mainly donations and tips. I always wanted to be able to say thanks to people online who help others with a lil tip and Bitcoin is perfect for this right now :)

Haha it's fun to speculate and dream on the wild side :) But I know a lot of people think the adoption will be very slow. I'm one of the crackpots that think it may not be so slow. Because as wealth is taken out of Fiat and added to BTC, the faster the value of BTC will grow compared to the value of Fiat like a snowball. Plus that drop will lower the public confidence in Fiat more making them want to buy BTC more and then in turn lowering Fiat and round and round we go... Gonna be a fun few years ahead!

We can only guess at these things. Nothing is certain but I feel very confident its going to be profitable as an investment.
It's been under the scalpel of all decent programmers to find weaknesses and none have appeared.
I predict another economic crisis to begin at the end of year. Gold prices will add huge strain to the central banks. Greece needs another 15 billion Euros by the end of the year and Italy is ticking bomb. The £ is dropping in value due to policy schemes and a threat on bullion supplying enough physical. Spain is suspiciously quite and Germans are getting pissed at their wasted taxes to bail black holes.
The US is stuck in a loop of printing more dollars and the slightest talk of stopping it and raising interest rates risk complete collapse. It's stuck in a whirlpool of printing and eventually inflation.
This has been unfolding for years and the politicians have only made things worse and are resorting to changing the way GDP and CPI (abandoning RPI altogether) are calculated to hide the terrifying statistics. We cannot hope for politicians to solve this and so the people will solve it instead and everyone will look for an alternative. Hopefully this will happen within the next 2 years so the infrastructures will be in place to support the alternative.
The most likely alternative will be Bitcoin, I very much doubt the general public will be happy to trust those responsible for the last disaster with the power to do it all over again.
This is my opinion of the future for BTC.

Hmmm, this is what I understood in layman’s terms:
“I’m a self-proclaimed master of the financial markets, take my word for it. I know super obvious psychological traits, including that which relate to value and perceived value in accordance to ownership. I know nothing about Bitcoin but will claim it suffers a “technical weakness”. If you ask me about this I will dodge the question and just relate the technical weakness in a network protocol to its current market price on ONE exchange. I ask people if they would support Bitcoin if they didn’t own any when it’s current price is possibly less than when some people believed in the concept and invested into it. In spite of all the above I have the cheek to say I would like to have a constructive discussion.
PS: I will now state that if Mt GOX servers are down that this wouldn’t affect Bitcoin Prices on Mt Gox servers. I will also claim as a financial wizard that a (currently) less than 1.2 Billion dollar market cap currency isn’t vulnerable to manipulation. I will overlook the fact that Bitcoin is a global currency and so not pay attention to prices say in Europe, China, Australia and well… the rest of the world.”

$1 trillion is a big understatement in my opinion. We can't see it yet, just how devalued our currencies are while the money is held in bubbles of speculation. My guess would be at least $100 trillion because the money in speculative assets will move into assets such as gold, silver, land and Bitcoin while the markets become their true value.
Just think GDP vs the banking assets thrown around. We grossly underestimate the how watered down our money will be in 10 years when the billions a month of printing hits the streets. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 17:49:12
Are these registered Bars or Paper Gold. If you can't see it hold it or withdraw it you don't own it. A lot of people who thought they own Gold are finding out they just own a Dollar price of a certain amount of Gold.

BTC is currently capped on its TPS to prevent bloating the blockchain, it is capable of handling 4,000 TPS with ease with the current protocol using basic CPU, the network is not using basic CPU, the hardware now could handle much much more than this. Also the blockchain will start to get smaller once "pruning" is activated, this will keep the blockchain from growing too large. But before this will happen the infrastructure of Bitcoin needs to be more stable.

I cannot for the life of me see why Ripple could be anything but a get rich scheme for Opencoin and investors. Not only has history but also current events show that a debt based currency system is unsustainable. History and current events also prove that trusting a person or group of individuals with a monopoly of power over a currency is always a bad thing. Are we going to fall for the "this time its different" speech again?
We have tried trusting companies (Banks) and even specially elected people (Politicians) to manage money and it always results in these said people twisting the system to their gain.
Bitcoin is popular because it is devoid of puppet masters and instead run by the consensus of people globally. Globally being a key word here, Bitcoin knows no boundaries, this means it is difficult for a country to do something similar to what the USA has been up to all these years. In the eyes of Bitcoin, all are equal.
To jump from a sinking debt currency into another seems like utter folly.

I agree, it is unlikely that the people of Somalia will begin to use Bitcoin directly.

This is true, a company may wish to short Bitcoin in this way but this sort of thing is unlikely to happen in the near future and is always a risk. It is worth noting that regulation is creeping into bitcoin and such acts will most likely become illegal. Bitcoin is destined to replace fiat, it is better than fiat in every way and so, in the future Bitcoin mining may well be regulated by governments to provent the acts you are worrying about.

I understand all that but this is getting into a debate of if Bitcoin has an intrinsic value or not and the personal ideology behind value in something.
But your response does clearly show the differences between the two.
I personally believe that Bitcoin is of value because it facilitates trade between two people regardless of location of an asset that is limited in supply and easy to monitor because it is open source and decentralized. How much that value is to something else depends, you could say that the value of Bitcoin has gone up considerably this year or you could say that the USD has been going down considerably this year. It all boils down to personal perspective vs global perception.
The Value element is all about supply and demand. I personally think we should be past caring about what gives something value as it is clear that humanity can make what ever it wishes to be worth value, giant rocks, metals, paper, software or even bottle caps. 
It's the attributes of the thing we choose to give Value that matter now and moving from a debt system to another is to my mind, failing to learn from mistakes.

Quantum Processors are a considerable way away, so far they can only function for very short periods of time while consuming huge amounts of energy. And to write the functionality for it to Hash correctly is within the time frame of say colonizing Mars. It's there, but only as theory.
And as for legislation, that will depend on each country. Mt Gox has functioned so far from Japan. The countries that fight Bitcoin would lose out while countries that are Bitcoin friendly would gain revenue from all the business. Governments can't even solve the most basic of problem, I very much doubt they can figure a solution to what Bitcoin is going to bring.

Lol I came to a conclusion some time ago to explain the kind of behaviour seen in this forum thread. Over the years religion has been in decline, does this mean that people no longer need religion? Everyone needs a belief system to some degree even if it is atheism. 
The way I see it is now, money is the new religion. It's something that has worked for them for years and they don't want to question it. Bitcoin brings everyone's faith in what makes someone successful into question. An uncomfortable situation many want to avoid. Even at the cost of ignorance :(

There are two camps to this argument.
A: Those that have a fair understanding of programming and able to change this issue with relative ease (I bet you fall into this one)
B: Those who have a basic or average understanding of computer programming who do not know how to solve this problem.
Now I can tell you that camp B is magnitudes bigger than A. If bitcoin is to go mainstream it needs people in Camp B and the people in Camp A, are the ones that can make that happen, by using their skills to solve the problems and helping those who are having trouble (Like Uguuuu above).
You can hardly expect an average person to know that
1. Bitcoin QT is opensource meaning anyone can fix this problem
2. That the person knows how to fix the problem and register the changes to QT
3. Knows where to go to ask for someone to make such a fix 
4. knows how much to pay for someones work in order to make this fix
We are living in a world with a wide spectrum of knowledge in all matters including computer science. I urge you to keep this in mind.

I think it is just the simmering down after the second bubble. It will probably hit around $30-50 as a staying point. But I very much doubt that we will be waiting two years for the next bubble again. The economic climate is far more unstable these days. 
Bond prices are most likely the next step in the slowly collapsing mismanaged fiat system we have now. But how that will affect the global economy is a complete mystery as there is nothing to look to for examples in the past due to the scale of the situation.
The Bitcoin economy is also evolving at an unprecedented rate, the new VC money and innovation is considerably quicker than what we have seen in the past. We have more programmers and innovators than in say, the early internet days. 
It is this that will most likely bring the next Bitcoin bubble. I believe Coinsetter may well play an important part in this. For good and for bad, as some of the changes to the Bitcoin economy allow for some enormous price swings and manipulation in the future.
But if you step back and look at the big picture it's all pretty simple. The world economy is simply not recovering, each new lease of life is little more than pumping volts into dead frog legs. Fractional reserve banking is simply not sustainable, as the global economy runs on this model, it is destined to fail.
We still use the same economic system and so the reasons everyone started taking notice of Bitcoin still exist. The Bitcoin protocol remains strong and has functioned well through all the turmoil and the only points of failure were things such as the Exchanges.
Bitcoin has proven that it functions well as a means of exchange. Just because people are forgetting why we all took notice of Bitcoin doesn't mean its ability to function should be brought into question. The only question is, how many more bubbles will we see and what kind of new world will we live in when we experience the final "Bitcoin Bubble".

Been saying this all along. ASIC won't cause centralisation because it is not within a ASIC manufacturers interest to control too large a portion of the market. It is also far more profitable to sell extra mining hardware than consume a huge share of the network. Furthermore long term, countries will make their own mining operations. You will see slices of pie reading USA gov, China gov, German gov and so on. You will also see Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm mixed with ASICMiner and the current giants. They won't be squashed by the companies because they won't enter the market once the value of a Bitcoin rises to a point high enough to make the early miners very powerful financially. The panic about ASIC was just silly drama not to mention something inevitable. To think that satoshi overlooked the creation of ASIC is ridiculous. People will look back at those crying the end of bitcoin because of ASICs in the same way as those crying the end of the world because of a solar eclipse.
Maybe one day technology will allow for a better system but for the time being, this is our reality.

Bitcoin is like Gold. Gold has had price bubbles before but there is an important fact that I think many people might be missing. Gold has been used as a means of currency long before graphs and charts. This means Gold was able to find its rough value over a long period of time that is not documented. Bitcoin is in the blind here, we cannot speculate what will happen it is pointless. We just need to remember why it is valuable to begin with, because it is so rare, secure and easy to use as a means of exchange. It may change its value radically but the reasons for why it is gaining its value has not changed. And the situation with the governments and banks cannot be fixed, only swept under the carpet once more.

You said it was easy to buy small amounts something I wasn't referring to. I explained who purchases large amounts of Gold and now you are debating the difference between Gold and stocks as investments.
All I will say in closing is that the east is purchasing large amounts of gold and that gold has to come from somewhere and the only logical place is the west.

I completely agree that Quark sounds like a terrible crypto currency but we should let the market decide that.
My main point would be Max knows his banking fraud and trickery. He doesn't know much at all about technology and certainly not the details in how Bitcoin or other crypto currencies work. He is simply applying sound economics to the customer facing end of Bitcoin and notices that it fits the bill for ideal money.
His a reporter for financial news and not computer programming. Most people in the media are struggling to keep up with the quickly evolving crypto currency space so lack of knowledge will occasionally be present.

As I understand it, asking questions about Bitcoin does not break the "community rules" for this reddit. I did search for a solution with no success so I turned to the active and knowledgeable community here. TY for link none the less.

Is it me or are the lyrics "I'll get to be unstoppable", appropriate for bitcoin really :)

Lol :D should have said to him "if you know how to cheat the system, you must be the best hacker in the world" 
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:41:05
How can you tell? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:34:29
He knows how to pack a punch mentioning the treatment of Japanese and African Americans and comparing it to the situation now (to an African American no less). Shame he didn't home in on how we all look at those who allowed these things as bad people, but at the time they thought they were "good people" too. History does love to rhyme... :(
@_date: 2013-05-22 09:51:42
Lol fancy bumping into you here! Congratulations :) 
Do you still have any of those heartstring marionette art books? Maybe I could buy one with bitcoins :D
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:25:26
Yep, I am just trying to make sure nobody misunderstands, and thinks that Bitcoin protocol cannot handle more than 7 or 37 TPS. Bitcoin is completely sound (theoretically) at handling all global TPS once the infrastructure is there.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:45:46
I shouldn't laugh but... Lol! 
@_date: 2013-08-31 15:46:13
I don't understand how people can't see that the current growth in difficulty is just the tip of the iceberg. We all need to remember that once bitcoin grows enough in popularity and value companies such as Intel, AMD and Nvidia will have a financial incentive to develop ASICs. With their production abilities the network hash rate will climb at rates far far higher than we have seen thus far.
It is for this precise reason that crypto currencies with fast block generation cannot succeed. In the case of major adoption there would be so many orphan chains generated every ten seconds that the currency would become inefficient from a confirmation perspective.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:47:43
I may be wrong but I think what we have seen so far is nothing. We will see maybe hundreds of USD fluctuations as the price goes higher. It all works with percentage not USD so the higher the value the bigger the changes. This will continue until people stop comparing the value of btc to YSD and instead compare it to what they can buy with it.
At least that's my opinion for what is coming up ahead in the future. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 12:11:05
Haha! I struggle to buy a coffee with Bitcoin... but babies!!!
Congrats to the family and science!
@_date: 2013-06-06 22:28:35
Why would a company that makes ASIC processors for mining Bitcoin want to devalue Bitcoin? I cannot see how that makes any sense...
@_date: 2013-05-14 12:17:10
I will look more closely into this later this afternoon. I like the idea of other Bitcoin clients to access the network rather than everyone using QT. I agree that it is far better that the team work on improving the network than the client but you need another set of alternatives that are good to begin with :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:11:34
Lol say that without laughing? 
@_date: 2013-10-15 09:24:37
I think it's just a big difference of ideology then. I don't consider things like bitcoin ETF as anything more than background noise. Why own an ETF when you can own the BTC yourself? It isn't as hard to store as gold or silver.
I have been very bullish on bitcoin the last three years and that stance only gets stronger as more real services grow around it. I haven't been wrong so far and with the current stance China is getting into with Gold, bitcoin,etc I think it's fair to assume they are protecting themselves from what's coming ahead.
The problem is people in the west forgot about the 97 Asian Financial Crisis and that it was caused by western banks. China vowed to never allow this to happen again and I think it may be possible that the tables about to turn.
Bottom line is we can only guess, so will have to give it a few years to see. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 06:21:41
But if such a system was possible while also invulnerable to botnets at least one of the Altcoins would implement it by now. We can wish for a better system but we have to use the technology available to us and not just say the grass is greener on the other side. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 09:40:13
Nooooo, cameras and microphones don't float around magically running on pixie dust. There are actual human beings behind operating the cameras, lighting and sound. They do not accept Bitcoin as a method of payment because as the video shows, most shops still don't accept Bitcoin.
Furthermore its worth noting that documentaries such as this cost time and money to make. It's all very well being unaware of the costs of making a documentary, but it takes a certain kind of ignorance to complain with no effort to do research first.
It makes me sad that people in a Bitcoin Reddit can watch what appears to be the first time grocery shopping was paid for using bitcoin and say it's "boring".

Anyone who uses their main PC to access their savings wallet of BTC is asking for trouble. BTC is currently very risky for non tech ppl. I am sure most people realise that using a stand alone rig using Linux and wire only connection to the net is the only reasonably safe way to access ones BTC savings.
My hope is that someone captures this market and builds a secure device for accessing ones Savings BTC Wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:25:50
NerdfighterSean and myself have been asking Hank about this but so far they are not very interested. I don't think they really understand Bitcoin yet and want to play things safe. But the more people that ask for this the better I guess.
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:25:57
If you get a site to do this for people, you could get a few bob from people donating and you would be making the Bitcoin economy just that bit more awesome. Well done! 
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:06:05
Glad you like. Shame nobody seems to be looking at this post. Wondering if I should repost with a new title or something...

@_date: 2013-11-02 14:00:33
Isn't one mBTC 0.0001? 0.001 would be ten mBTC?
As I understand it:
1 = 1 btc
0.01 = 1 bitcent
0.0001 = 1 millibit 
0.000001 = 1 microbit 
0.00000001 = 1 satoshi
@_date: 2013-09-01 16:42:40
Bitbargain might be a little more expensive but you can have your bitcoins within an hour or so. I've even had transactions take less than 10 mins. If speed matters more than value its a good place to buy.
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:54:13
That's true I forgot about that. Still I think he seems better versed in finance than computing and I don't think his done much more than read the white paper for bitcoin. It's far more complicated than the stuff he worked on in my opinion. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:47:03
Again you need to do more research as you don't seem to know important elements to the subject you are talking about. Bitcoin can be used via SMS.
I strongly advise that you spend a lot more time looking into Bitcoin and the features growing around it.

.. hmm very good question.
@_date: 2013-03-24 01:47:30
You have misunderstood me. I am not saying that Bitcoin is causing anything, Bitcoin was made because people felt the system of fiat currency needed replacing. This means the cause of change is Fiat Currency and not Bitcoin. If it wasn't Bitcoin then something else would have come along.
Bitcoin is a way for change, not the reason for change.

Hmm... Buy new parents? 
@_date: 2013-08-31 20:48:40
Maybe right now, but do you really think that will be the case if bitcoin continues to grow as it has in value in the last four years? A Bitcoin is only worth 100-200 dollars right now because most people don't even know bitcoin exists. Once most people not only know about it but also actually use it... It certainly will be profitable for such companies to begin making ASICs.

Common misconception this, officially this may be correct but if you look into specific data you will see its close to 60 cents per dollar goes to war/military funding. It's just covered up in political jargon that takes hours of digging through. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:07:53
Because it fit fully with my understanding of how money should work and how to fix many problems we experience today. My concerns to bitcoin failing to be a success have passed almost entirely.
NB I bought btc under the assumption it would replace not only gold and silvers store of value but also at least 60% of all the value in stocks as well. So although right so far I am a very long way from being where I expect to be but I don't expect to reach that point for at least 2 years.
@_date: 2013-07-06 08:45:25
Lol! I'm sure people are missing the point here, it's a steam reference... Am I right?

Interesting stuff! It's surprising the speed at which btc seems to be taking off over there. Need to start poking my Chinese friends asking what they noticed as a regular person in China.
