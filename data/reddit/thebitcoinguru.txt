Its not a DDOS, its a run on the bank, essentially.

I was right.  The projected trajectory was pretty much spot on.  All you naysayers.... well you probably got what you deserved by not selling when I told you to. If you had you would have sold at ~230.  Now its ~130.

I was underestimating.  Its at 130 now and will drop to 70 before bouncing back to around 100, in my opinion, in around 12 hours time

Its not a DDOS, its a run on the bank.  Theres a big and terrifying difference

its the transaction lag

It will be down through 200 in the next 45 minutes.
I called the bubble bursting as it happened.

Since the OP bitcoin has lost another 9% in value.  This is now the single greatest drop in absolute value in a single 6 hour period in Bitcoins history.
Keep telling yourself its just a blip kids.  We will slide back down through 200 overnight tonight.
