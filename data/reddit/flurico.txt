IMO quoting Putin in a non news way but as an argument to prove a point is laughable.

Dominance based on market capitalization is a flawed metric, for obvious reasons. CMC uses every single coin not listed individually for the "others" tag, every, single, one. Just an example, lets go to CMC,  "Qubitica" Mcap $119M, volume not even $100k daily or Bytecoin with the 50k in volume. Just to name 2 of the most evident examples, this coins are in the top 100. 
Mcap is a faulty metric by itself, but if we consider that since the standardization of tokens like ERC-20 a boom of new (useless) tokens happened, comparing data from 2013 to data from 2017 using mcap sounds disingenuous, not only because of mcap been flawed, but because now more coins count for the "others" tag, decreasing Bitcoin dominance by pure brute force.
[This article]( measures dominance taking into account liquidity. I should point that the author didn't correct the fake volumen, but this gives me a different perspective. According to the author, Bitcoin real dominance taking liquidity into account is over 80% of the market.

Ah, an authoritarian leader. Who's better to be quoted on a Bitcoin related subreddit in a positive way. 
"RUSSIA PLANS TO DITCH US DOLLAR FOR BITCOIN, SAYS UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR"
Quality content.

Wanna simple explanation? Looks ugly and I wouldn't use it. What an asshole that can't take criticism, people like TO are the type that hurt Bitcoin more than a symbol by defending to death, with simplistic arguments, everything Bitcoin related :)

I responded already.


In comparison, $ or € have way better and easier design than this.

IMO it's not good. It's overly complicated, would be hard to write that by hand and looks very asymmetric. It looks wrong to my eyes.

Do we pretend to make Bitcoin standard money or not? At schools and universities all around the globe is normal to write currency symbols by hand while taking notes. Mixing between mathematic language to common language is not easy with a computer, some professors may prefer no computers at all or maybe you don't have access to one, people get education in developing countries too or at least should. When I have to take notes like a monkey on cocaine I don't have the time to write that symbol, the $ or the € are simple, just an S or C with sticks, takes no time. This is a S that develops into an asymmetric circle with 2 semi sticks at the top and bottom of the S, I rather use a minor s, sat or even a minor b than that when I'm in this situation. Or maybe you don't expect Bitcoin to be taught at all, then yeah, it doesn't matter what symbol you use. Product design is important, even when you think it is not.

If you are concerned about anonymity on your Bitcoin transactions, you should learn about UTXOs, Coin Control, address reuse and CoinJoin as a basic, so you don't tie your name to a Bitcoin address.

Can't do it via opt in softfork like segwit, no one expects Satoshi to move his coins to a quantum proof wallet to be honest. The hardfork route would leave Bitcoin split (again) in 2 chains and Satoshi's coins will remain untouched in the "non quantum proof" chain, this can end as a total fiasco. As I said, Satoshi's coins will be hard to secure, this has been stated before the last time Google said something about their quantum computer.

Honestly, I don't get why people thinks that cloud mining is a good idea. Even my dad has a cloud mining service, a few bucks but he still did waste money on that. It's so simple to me that I can't understand why this is a thing yet, why would no one offer you a profitable mining service when they can take full profit out of their rigs/miners? They are essentially losing money on purpose.

Exactly. Some people will tell you that they've seen faster, near instant LN payments (I've seen those), but don't listen to them. 5 full seconds? Get the fuck outta here ma man! That's an eternity! Imagine waiting for 5 full seconds! Imagine paying with a credit card and taking that long to process and print the receipt. Imagine waiting for a cashier to give you the change for more than 5 seconds. Just imagine what could've I done in those 5 full seconds I was waiting there! It's goddamn XXI century, we are always in a hurry! My schedule is planned to the millisecond! Thank god we have Nano that can process the payment in 1 second, just imagine not having Nano. Humanity was saved from a certified apocalypse thanks to those 4 extra seconds.

Few years ago I used to lend Bitcoin through Polo, lasted for a month or so I wasn't comfortable with my Bitcoin being there. But I must said that it paid well, very well indeed, I calculated the equivalent monthly interest rate and it was something around 80%

So sanctions made personally to Maduro and family affected the country itself, correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't that just proves how deeply corrupted is Maduro and his friends and how Maduro's affairs are rooted into Venezuela's (illegitimate) government?
So what I understand is, no matter what you do, he is going to do whatever he wants and it is better to step aside and just don't even try to help the situation. If militar intervention is not recommended (seen how it worked out in the not so past), sanctions neither... What do Venezuelans have left from the international community? Declarations and stern looks? "Ok Maduro, you are a really bad boy please stop".

Giving you a solution, not judging the idea. If you truly want that amount of Bitcoin to not be cashed out in 18 years you can make a paper wallet and remove some characters, of course you have to write those down somewhere safe and when you think the time has come, just handle it to the kid. I don't know, this is the easiest thing I can think of right now.

Dude, this sub is at full paranoia mode now. People saying he was not elected, please STFU, we are not debating if Roger is trying to scam noobs with dot com or shit like that. There is people there dying, criminality over the top, is atm the most dangerous country of the world (statistically speaking, not making this up), Maduro took full control of the country denying the legimite Asamblea Nacional creating the Asamblea Nacional Constituyente. Guaido is the legitimate president since the opposition won the election for the real and constitutional Asamblea Nacional. 
The fact that the USA is siding with him does not make him a new dictator cause he is not. Dude, for real, this sub seems full paranoic, now I get why people think crypto is for weird people and nerds, you can't take gradual changes, trying to make tabula rasa with our past and present... Stand with Guaido, he is the chance of Venezuelans to finally have freedom.
Un saludo a todos los venezolanos que me puedan leer, mucho apoyo y ánimos desde España.

Gen 3+ nuclear plants are already really safe, gen 4 will reduce risks to virtually 0. Nuclear is a more plausible solution to reduce CO2 emissions than any other renewable source of energy. Also, has a lesser impact on environment, hydraulic energy affects rivers and its ecosystem, wind power is devastating for birds and solar is highly toxic in it's production.
Nuclear is the way, ditch Greenpeace anti nuclear discourse already.
