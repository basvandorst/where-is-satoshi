Anyone used the code? Is it simpler or more difficult than ETH?
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:42:07
Yeah, yeah....been hearing this since 2014....FIAT is going to collapse....Stock going to burst....
To may people waiting for traditional crash....watching Big Short movie and thinking they are smarter than the rest....
Maybe there will not be crash like 2008 ever again.... 
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:34:20
Just fucking stop with this kind of posts already.....Half of this reddit is garbage like this.
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:16:24
Been looking like vaporware for a long time now. Premiered while ago, nothing's happening since then
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:01:28
So I have to wait 12 more years to retire? GTFO!
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:48:56
What if 0 confirmations till tomorrow? How long till the transaction goes back if not successful?
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:02:16
Fuck this idiot for promoting ETH
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:46:45
He said 15k so it's not going to happen. Maybe 4k, maybe 14k, maybe 16k, but not 15k.
I always hate when such idiots jinx

Introducing ShitCash trading was apparently more important.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:41:07
Great. And some people have the balls to whisper mass-adoption. What a fuck fest.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:29:50
He didn't, Your shitcoin BCash is not welcome here.
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:00:48
Still, it's better than another fucking crypto price checker ;)
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:44:15
I would rather see list of these forks each with price and exchange that accepts it's deposits
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:30:59
Some promising coins here. And no shitcoins like BCash. Well done.
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:21:31
Yes, more news like this and less like 'reach xxxxx USD by christmas"
@_date: 2018-05-18 10:22:15
There is a big frame drop when You want to see the whole network. Good.
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:08:37
Same will happen with 99% of today's top 50
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:31:48
Prospective thinking over immediate financial gains. Respect.
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:21:18
Also, when I click on the number of my transaction, I can see another transaction, not mine. WTF, are my transaction connected with another one? Is this normal?
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:53:55
We will not see 10k this year, so joke's on You.
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:00:25
He's making a fool of himself. NOTHING amazing bitcoin related was shown during consensus 2018, altcoins didn't impress as well. 
Also, he looks like he didn't sleep a while. That's what happens when You're obsessed over price. I would prefer if he said sth about LN or Rootstock, because without these projects succeding we will not even reach 10k.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:23:16
This was very helpful.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:08:32
I came here for the answer to this question or to ask it  first myself and get a shit load of likes. I received none of that. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:42:05
This is something I'm waiting for, more even than LN.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:37:47
You think it will pass tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:45:17
I meant desert LOL ;)
@_date: 2018-05-12 10:08:13
it gave me 3 confirmations after 8h
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:29:08
8.113 sat/B
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:56:24
I would pay for it 10 000 BTC even at today's rates.
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:18:11
I will not support BCash, if that's what You hope for.
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:19:30
If you have any issues, just send the file to my email, I will have a look.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:24:46
I want to retire next year so this guy is wrong.
