It is hard to reason about fees, I will do my best to reason from first principles:
The market makes sure that the security
    M = Money spend on hashing power per block
    T = number of transactions per block
    f = average transaction fee
    R = reward subsidy
    M = T*f + R
Over time reward subsidy goes to 0, so we can say:
    M = T*f
Currently, T = 2000, without a blocksize increase we might get a little bit higher (segwit) but not a lot higher, lets say 4000.
    M = 4000*f
The question that is left open; how much do we want to pay for security of bitcoin? Last year we paid on average around $10.000 per block. that means $2.5 would have been the transaction fee without subsudy. But it has been $20.000 for some time this year and as bitcoin gets more valuable it would be rational to spend more on security. If bitcoin gets 100x as valuable maybe we want to spend 10x more on security. So I would say between $2.5 and $25 dollars per tx.

It's a hard think to reasons about and this is one of the points I am less certain about. I Hope and think bitcoins security cost are not linear with price, I.e. 100x price increase =&gt; 100x security cost. 
My thinking is like this: the risk we defend ourselfs against is a 51÷ attack, not against someone doing a double spend (it's impossible to make money this way because your assets mining hardware will devalue slot). If bitcoin is 100x more valuable than it will be only more interesting (valuable) for one or more entities (governments, banking organizations, competing currencies, multinationals) to preform such an attack, how much more is hard to say, but the thing is that we don't want to take any risk and nobody knows the optimal security so we probably should overshoot!

Thanks for taking the time to read it. Solo miners could join a solo miners group anyone who believes solo mining is important could join it. If all the miners jump to a certain pool, the extra earnings that this group will get will be defided among more miners, and so it will be lower per miner. And another pool will be more interesting to join. In other words there will be an equilibrium.

I believe bitcoin is a lot of things to a lot of people, and it would be a shame to price many of the usecases out at this point. Think about the smart contracts that will never be decentralised because they where to expensive, the coffees that where never paid with bitcoin because it was too expensive, if we cap the size we cap the amount of people using it. Bitcoin will never be what many investors hoped it would be, price will drop, and bitcoin won't change the world.

I don't get why we would not use FSS-RBF. You can calculate what percentage of the miners uses FSS-RBF by looking at the blockchain, lets say in the future 95% of the miners uses FSS-RBF. The merchant can be sure that in 95% of the cases there is no possibility for a double spent. 
If miners are incentived to use FSS-RBF (bitcoin is a way more valuable protocol, if you can calculate the trust you have in unconfirmed transactions).

If the amount of unspent transactions are to many to store, may it is an interesting idea to 'tax' them. By asking a some extra fee for every unspent month, for example: You pay 100 satoshi fee for every month that your bitcoins aren't used.
- At a certain point transactions that aren't spent for a while will cost more in fees than they are worth, miners could take them. 
- At the same time users are incentivised to store their coins in only a few outputs.
Just an idea (don't think bitcoin will every be able to make a big move like this)

Sigwit is in no way a long term solution for scaling. 
To continue with your internet anology: the internet of the 80s scaled in to ways: in functionality as where you are referring to and throughput the amount of data that you can send from one computer to another.

I agree a 100%, I think NFC is very promising, it is integrated in most modern day phones. In the Netherlands people are already used to pay through NFC (with cards and phones). Is anyone experimenting with it?

A key part of bitcoins value is its network effect, if we allow an other crypto to get bigger, bitcoin will only go down..

Is there really no one who is willing to do some estimations? Of course it is dependant upon the market, but that doesn't help any person or company deciding if they want to use bitcoin. Imagine having to make a choice today, while you have no idea about the costs.

Okay there are 2 options:
* We ask everyone to check for all these things for every transaction.
* We stop depending on bitcoin addresses for security, like I wrote [here](
@_date: 2016-06-03 13:46:32
Mainly against a man in the middle attack, where a hacker tries to make you send bitcoin to his bitcoin address instead of someone else's. For example while online shopping or through a fishing email.

It uses x.509 certificates, don't know nothing about those, Wikipedia says they are safe :P
You can use https with this protocol.
True, a little leg work goes a long way, but we cannot ask everyone to check everything always. The think is, bitcoin transactions are final so let's please make sure people make the right transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-03 11:16:51
We should not go for *too bad*, we should strive for great! QR codes are already a step in the right direction, they hide the address for the user.

The bitcoin payment protocol is totally decentralized, it is a protocol between the sender and receiver no one else. Bitcoin is also about security and I think bitcoin addresses are one of the most unsafe parts of the bitcoin protocol.

I think part of the problem is that people think working in bitcoin is writing C++ for Bitcoin Core, while bitcoin is permissionless and you can play around with bitcoin using just JS and bitcore or Java and BitcoinJ.

Good question.
If I would want to send money to you for example (I don't know you), I think bitcoin addresses are and will be for a long time the most save anonymous way of paying. Currently, the bitcoin payment protocol would only add complexity. But there are already other ways to hide bitcoin addresses, through QR codes or a [bitcoin URI scheme bip21](
But most bitcoin transactions I send, go to services and companies there I would like to see less bitcoin addresses.

This is a great question, and a good list could be valuable for the whole community. I think we should not focus on exchanges, but only places where you can buy instantly. Imagine a persons want to buy a product, he sees that the only way payment method available is bitcoin. He has heard of this bitcoin thing, but does not really understand this internet money. 1. If we also ask him to go to an exchange, 2. send money onto it, 3. put an bid order, 4. wait for the order to be filled and deposit the money.
That should not be how bitcoin works, for first time users.

15 times. Half of the blocksize is already filled with people wanting to send there transactions.

This is pretty big, a bank that is experimenting with a bitcoin wallet.

Amazing that Coinbase is putting effort into the Dutch market. In the Netherlands we have an perfectly fine payment system, way saver than credit cards; iDeal.

People here don't want to know the answer but it's quite simple: Fixed block size! There will always be periods when there is a lot more demand for sending bitcoin, usualy around big volatility. I guess that 2 times as many people want to send transcations as usual, that means that halve of the people have to dicide not to send a transaction or they have to wait, while the other half pays more... why is this so hard to understand. If you accept fixed blocksize you accept transactions and fee spikes and stuck transactions every ones in a while..

They are not running around, there are more people who want to buy or sell. To do so they need to move their coins from their wallet to an exchange or reverse, this are the transactions you see in the backlog.

You printed out some nice diagrams, but they don't have to do much with centralization. This is just the data that is available.
1. Mining pools don't say much about real decentralization. It is more interesting to know how the distribution of ownership of the ASICs is. These pools often don't own these machines.
2. It is great that there are alternative development groups of developers working on there independent client.  Currently I think core is by far the best, but I don't want to be dependant upon them. that would be very centralized

1. You need to get bitcoin, for optimal liquidity you need to find a good bridge to move your local currency into bitcoin. This will be hard, but that's also your advantage over other people. Maybe you know people that export value from your country to the rest of the world, these people will earn dollars or euro, so you could easily buy bitcoin. 
2. Get out of trouble, make sure your business seems as legal as possible or better is legal.
3. You could sell on localbitcoins or paxful or any other decentral exchange as well as a localshop. 
Good luck!

Phishing is really something we should get rid off in bitcoin land, it hurts the trust in using bitcoin. We need better ways to check if we are sending the money to the right company.
It would be great if wallets could verify a transaction came from a certain domain, every time you make a transaction your wallet learns that it can trust the domain. Next time it will show you you made traded earlier though this domain.
This can be done by combining the bitcoin payment protocol &amp; HTTPS. Merchants can start verifying their domain name now.
