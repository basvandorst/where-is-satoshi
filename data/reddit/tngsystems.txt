No. People who enthusiastically babble "HODL" are as autistic as they come.

So **you're** to blame!

OP has come out and said that he hadn't been telling everyone in the office about it. Just conversations he had overheard. Which is entirely rational as a 60+ year old lady in my office has prompted conversations about bitcoin and asking whether she should buy some for her husband's birthday.

My 3rd dip, I'm already past point of caring. Doing this for the long run on the altcoins :)

This is literally reposted yesterday from someone who actually made this comic.

Yep, by going back in time to buy more bitcoin you create a new timeline where the smallest actions (such as buying thousands of a coin worth fractions of a dollar) can have large consequences.  
End message is people should stop wishing on the past and start acting on the present to enrich themselves in the future.

Sounds like someone has a chip on their shoulder... so you use this analogy everywhere? Like choosing between doorknobs at the hardware store. “Honey, these doorknobs are exactly the same as iMessage”.

I hope that wasn't the impression I gave.
I think everyone is using HODL because everyone else is... It's like a "well it's not really that funny but I want to appear "in"... "

My advice is don’t invest anything you aren’t prepared to lose, and if that amount is 0, then just don’t invest.

Investing in anything is for people with disposable income. If you live pay check to pay check then do not buy coins. I myself only put away a small amount in cardano compared to others but in the last 3 days it’s doubled in value. My friend bought a small amount in ripple which tripled in value. It’s not just bitcoin that’s rising!

Also on his Twitter "Friend of the people" says someone willingly conning people for Bitcoin. Go fuckyourself, whoever you are, Bitcoin scrounger.

It’s a bit fucked if you ask me!

It really is a shame that greed persists in so many that people think $3,000, or $700! or £200! You know, easy come easy go, but we all make mistakes and pocketing off someone else's mistake is not what we as a society should be doing. Some people would say "Well people should be more careful with money" but watch the tune change when they lose some.

Even if it was hideable, it's the same thing. One time a lady infront of me withdrew £200 from a cash machine then walked off without taking the cash. I didn't even need to think twice, I took the cash, walked up to the shop I saw her go in, found her and handed it back. IIRC, she didn't offer a reward and I didn't expect one, she had a huge look of relief on her face. We've all been in that position, losing something and feeling dread, even worse is when you don't realise you've lost something until it's way too late. The look of relief on her face was payment enough for a good deed.
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:23:22
I'll have that $200 then.

Can you get a quick job in a bar or something if only to keep you afloat until you get another job?   
Tbh looks like next run is 2021 at least.

It is owned by the Daily Mail which is possibly the most poisonous news source in the world.

I’m so glad the narrative on this fucking sub is changing

What just happened to the price? It dropped like $600 in a matter of moments - who sold so much and how much was sold?
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:40:59
I'm not a buy-high, sell-low, I'm a buy-high, sulk-low - where when the price goes low I sulk about it for ages.
