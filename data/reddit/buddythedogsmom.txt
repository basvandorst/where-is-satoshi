This scumbag stole money he knew was for my dog's life-saving operation. I had an account with Intersango and he locked me out and kept my 52 bitcoins, now worth about $20,000. Like you I got fobbed off. He wanted to see photo ID so I sent it the same day. Now he has my money and enough ID to do anything with it.
His previous customers at Bitcoinica are missing about $50,000,000.
I cannot believe he is still free and not locked up yet. Did you make a police report? This guy needs taking off the streets.

Yes, I sent the location of one of his accomplices to the lawyers. Intersango, the company that stole $20k from me is specifically ruled out of the lawsuit though due to jurisdiction. I'm more inclined the just get him locked up. It is organised crime with the same repeating patterns of behavior so a seizure and redistribution of bitcoins should be possible.
Hey, you know that wallet address you had for Strateman? Do you have any screenshots of him saying it is his address? I mean I know it is as I can follow the transactions on the blockchain, but some proof for a judge, that is easy to understand, would be great.

He stole the money for the smaller dog's heart operation. It says $10k on the video, but bitcoins went up a bit since I made it.
There is a link in there to a fuller explanation.

And yes, I did speak to a nice lady at the police department in Inglewood or wherever. She was like 'Twenty thousand dollars!! Girl you need to get his ass locked up!!"
Then I told her about the other $50 mil.. :
