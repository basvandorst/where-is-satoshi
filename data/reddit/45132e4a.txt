Huge straw man argument.
I didn't say I don't value regulation or want volatility.
I do believe that privacy (not anonymity) is vital for a free society.
it is not flat earth to believe in basic human rights like privacy.  Central banks and oppressive governments have done a great job of brainwashing people that privacy is the reason for terrorism and crime.  That is silly.

What parallel financial world do you live in?
Temporary ban?  It wasn't lifted until 1977!
Gold was ~~bought~~ confiscated from citizens at the super low price of $20 per ounce.
Then, the US.gov changed the dollars to gold peg from $20 per ounce to $35.
So, they paid citizens $20 per ounce when the "market value" was $35 - set by them.  It was theft, pure and simple.

Sorry that your post is so hostile.


No, society wants their privacy.  They are scared into believing that cash is bad by so much propaganda that terrorists use it.  Central banks want to eliminate cash because they can charge to use a payment system and governments want to ban cash so that they can control people.


Money is a product that has value that can be exchanged: cows, salt, gold.
What you're referring to is currency.  Yes, currency must be regulated because it is a receipt for money.
Or it used to be.  Now it is merely a credit or a debit made at the whim of a central banker.
It is sold today that we should want "transparency" and have a cashless system because only the crooks use cash.  Who sells this idea?  Central bankers - the same kinds that created derivatives, racked up trillions in losses, arm twisted a scared congress into bailing them out, and now won't even say where the money is.
Where's the $9 trillion that missing from the Fed?
Think about a world without cash.  You have NO financial privacy whatsoever.  You can't conduct business between two people without a bank.  The bank is the intermediary in all transactions and takes their bite.  The whole point of Bitcoin was to eliminate the bank and return person to person payments and some modicum of privacy.
A government can tax what it needs to pay the bills.  There is no need to know everyone's comings and goings.
You probably think that the government reading our emails and listening to our calls is OK because you have nothing to hide and we might catch some terrorists as a result.
Many of the terms you are using in regards to finance are not correct - they are changes that have been made in order to sell bad ideas.  I recommend this as a good read:

this is the prob with exchanges and pools.  With a bank, if an employee steals your money they can often get it back or its insured.  And it is harder to steal because if cash, they have to carry.  If wire, there is a trail.
With crypto, ANY employee can get the key and raid the account anonymously.  They might raid a cold wallet and no one knows for days (weeks) until they need to get to that wallet.
not saying its an inside job but you have to have cajones or a lot of trust to leave your keys with anyone else

not proven - no evidence whatsoever
What we do know is that the Chinese were closed out and that Bitthumb is one of the few cash exchanges - very likely ALL of the China business was funneled to this exchange.

I dunno, how I see it is that core is cutting off its nose to spite its face: don't want 2mb because Ver wants it and we're going to block just to block those we disagree with - meantime, mem pool clogs, fees go up - I see no reason why a 2mb breathing space increase can't work until LN or some other solution is worked out

Worry not camereye.
I WAS very worried after I saw this post about 3 hours ago.  I put some BTC on Kraken a few days ago in case I wanted to make a trade.  After I saw this I got worried and decided to send it to my wallet.
I experienced the same things that other's posted here: each time I clicked on the withdrawal tab it alternately told me I couldn't do that with only tier 3 verification and other times it told me that withdrawals were disabled.
I kept clicking on the withdraw button every few minutes for about 2 hours then went to dinner.  I just got back and tried it again and I was able to get in.  I initiated the withdrawal and now I see my transaction on the block chain.
Kraken is most likely just swamped - volume is huge and transaction times are slow.  If you're trying to move some $/coin through Kraken, just keep trying until it takes.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:49:46
they certainly have an influence, no?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:28:03
It is this way by design to drive traffic to off chain solutions - as much has been said by blockstream in their website and Back's twitters.
I don't know why one group cries about the fees and then another group derides for the same.  According to most here, the concensus is small blocks for security reasons.  Yet, most people (a concensus) want lower fees.  So, the same people who want lower fees and faster transactions also don't want bigger blocks.
You can't have it both ways, you either have one or the other until some magic is pulled from the hat (LN or similar).

PSA: Don't use the Free Crypto wallet, I used it and it turned out to be a scam.  I just lost 10 BTC!!!  :-(  :-(
I'm posting this so that anyone else who is thinking of using that wallet can learn from my loss.
If you're interested in helping out, my wallet is 292939(0MVQWE......
How many of these do we see each week?
And so, if, you send your Bitcoin to a cold wallet that you create, and then post said on a public forum.
There's your proof that you lost your Bitcoin.
Or, how about you just lost your damned password, happens all the time.
As for NEW Bitcoin - I think it might be a prudent decision to send immediately to Monero after purchase, then to a cold wallet.  Who is to say that you didn't buy $1,000 worth of BTC and then use it to buy goods/services that moment for $1,000?
IRS can discover that you bought 4,000 gold coins when gold was $300 an ounce.  But they can't do shit to you unless you sell them.
You can have $6 Billion in BTC and the IRS can't touch you until they see you selling/converting/transacting with BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:24:27
So, your solution to the problem is to throw in the towel?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:33:07
Interesting theory but I don't buy it.
China just banned exchanges, this is why we saw the Chinese VPN traffic to Korea.
The price in cash started to rise as soon as the Seg2x was called off.  All the segwit folks realized they weren't going to get a shot at BTC so they decided (as they should have done in the first place) to just compete with it head to head.
All this talk of it going away is emotional talk based on chest puffery.
Go over to r/btc and read their posts, they're as convinced they're right as the folks over here.  That coin isn't going anywhere.  It is going to be something like ETH but it isn't going to vanish.
I see the two coins occupying space like Apple and Android.  Pick your flavor and enjoy the ride.

Anonymous money is what the US was founded on.  Privacy, privacy in your affairs, without government interference.
The gov can get their cut just by taxing energy or with a flat tax.
The ONLY reason they don't want anonymous money is for control.
That you believe less shows just how vested you are in the current system.

BCH is not a 51% attack - its a different coin.
When 51% of of mining directed at BTC tries to re-write the BTC chain, then its an attack.
While BCH may have a mining cartel, BTC has a banking cartel - have you looked at who owns blockstream?  its a bunch of banks (big banks)

Don't worry, Bitcoin Cash isn't going anywhere.  Its hodlers are just as fanatical as we are.  It will probably be up come January.

I totally agree
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:52:06
I see.  So, "they" reached into all of our wallets and sold our BTC?
If Jihan and Ver bought up 30 billion in ETH, would that also be an attack?
What happens when Ver sells his BTc?  the price drops $500?  Is that a permanent drop or will others of us buy the dip and stabilize?  Oh wait, that's exactly what happened today.
most of the drop in BTC today wasn't Ver, it was nancys here crying "attack attack" and freaking out the newbs.
If more time was spent talking about positive things and ignoring bcash, it would have less effect on the price of bitcoin.

I've held BTC for a long time.  The tin foil hat shit in this sub is reaching epic proportions.
Ver tried to KILL bitcoin?
OK, I'll bite.  Ver put his billions in.  Jihad put his billions in.  Chinese miners put their billions in.  All these guys go full tilt into bcash.  Lets say the get the price to $7,000 today alone.
What happens to the price of BTC?  Drops, maybe not.
Uh, what, you sell your BTC and go home and cry to mommy?  Hell no.  &gt; 90% of us here will buy the dip and it will stabilize (as it did today).
If Ver can "kill" Bitcoin by buying another coin, then BTC is shit and isn't worth $7k.  
really folks, lets try not to be hysterical girls, its unbecoming
