The level of illegal transactions have not increased exponentially like the price has.  I would say the amount has stayed steady.  Now given that the price has dropped about in half, the percentage of illegal transactions has doubled.
On top of that, given the number of scuzbags who did crappy things through Bitcoin and now are accidentally rich after the rise... There might be less illegal transactions.

The person didn't have to save a dime.  Just what the gov takes out for ssn and the employer contribution.  And yes, a million is enough for someone earning minimum wage to continue thier lifestyle.  It is a heck of a lot better than the ssn check that is worth nothing at death.  If the person earned more, the amount it grows to would be proportionate.
This is a worse case earning scenario.  Oh and the disability would be better too.  Easily replacing the income, much better than ssn disability.

3 makes sense if VAT is applied to the purchase.  If VAT is not paid, it should be taxed as an investment.
Some thought needs to be applied to how you determine a cost basis for BTC as an investment.  One huge issue would be the accumulation of small amounts of BTC (ie a business taking it as payment) that then grows if the price takes off and is sold. You could have a cost basis report that is massive.  Likewise being able to prove losses could be equally problematic.  Keeping track of that will be an accounting nightmare for volume businesses taking bitcoion.
You can say "don't tax it". But if you don't tax it then you should not be able to write off losses and for the past year, that would be significant.  Gains need to be taxed and losses written off.
@_date: 2018-09-19 01:22:38
Sorta.  Cash is expensive to handle and risky.  Checks clear slowly and offer risk.  Credit in the store is even slower and risky.  Getting the funds the next day and offloading collection risk has a value that credit cards offer to the merchant.  3% is probably high for a decent volume merchant but 1% would be a no brainer.
And yes, there will be a cost to sitting at a register waiting for a $3 Bitcoin transaction to confirm.
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:27:47
That's the point. When you are presented with a valid credit card, the bank/card issuer has done the credit checks and has a system to do collections.  You as the merchant don't have do that.  If you offered credit to everyone that walked in the door, you would have a lot more fraud than .5%.  The credit card takes that away from the merchant for a fee and with an instant transaction and next day cash transfer.
The issue is not how cheaply the card company can do it, the issue is what would it cost as a merchant to do all the things a credit card does for you and will you pay for that.  The answer is clearly yes, merchants will pay for all that.  Now there are periodic squabbles about how much to pay, but that has been going on since they were introduced.  But even low margin grocery stores (although they pay much less than 2.5%) find the cards compelling.
If bitcoin can offer an attractive competition to credit cards, all would benefit.

They collected on government guarantees during the crisis.  Then they got paid by the government to clean it up after. And nobody went to jail and damn few were fired.

It may not be better than Bitcoin, that is why one scenario has the .gov eliminating Bitcoin.  Yes it is decentralized, but it is a public network.  It will be very possible for computers doing transactions to be identified, and blocked or physically confiscated.  
Your Bittorrent is an excellent example.  While the government has not devoted itself to destroying it, the entertainment industry has.  If you put up a newish movie, you can expect a letter through your ISP telling you to take it down.  Do it enough and you will face a civil lawsuit.  The entertainment industry has tried over and over to criminalize the activity.  You can guarantee that if the government decides to fight Bitcoin, there will be legal consequences to supporting the network.
Again, not a guarantee to happen, but to claim it won't be a threat is naive.

They bought them because they had private mortgage insurance so those loans could compete with federal guarantees.

Some of the lower tranches were burned, some contracts that could not successfully tie to a real loan were abandoned, but most of it was made good.  ESP those made to national and pension funds.

Yes, the chain will survive.  But processing can be severely reduced.  Eliminated, no.  But if people running the processing get arrested and equipment confiscated, it'll end fast.  If processing becomes spotty and unreliable, the system will have huge problems.
I don't think this is likely.  But it is a risk if governments decide to take it down.  Perhaps the biggest risk is if the governments decide to adopt blockchain currency and want to eliminate the competition.

I can go to a crappy bank, open an account and between the laws and insurance, any money I have will be there tomorrow.  Knowledge level zero.  I can check my account 10 different ways and know what I have there.  I can write checks and know it will go through for the amount I wrote.  I can get cash, I can deposit more.  Bitcoin is not that easy and does not appear to be getting easier.  It won't have widespread adoption without that.  And without widespread adoption, it might not "make it".

They would rather buy Gold, but you can't by physical gold in large quantities quickly and hide it.  You can do that with Bitcoin.  But these people are not HODL.

Personally, I would not do pay pal, bitcoin or some app.  In every state a check written in fraud is a prosecutable offense.  I would do the transaction at a bank (and only accept a bank check or a transfer to the bank if I am selling) during business hours and get the signed/notarized registration at the end of the process.  A decent branch will have someone who will walk through a transfer.
Then you have layers of legal protection and the ability to roll back either the check or the registration in a case of fraud.

It could have become criminal, but the in place administration was not going to do a thing for obvious reasons.  Again, not a tax court issue.  Tax court rules are different from the rest of the justice system.  In some ways it's better (ie you can ask for a ruling before you take an action and get it cleared), but in many ways it is a violation of normal US criminal concerns.

It's not seizure.  First off, I don't agree with these rules.  But to make a legal argument, you need to have a well though out argument.  A law was passed that requires a financial entity to identify it's customer.  You have to prove that violated the Constitution to win the day.

*In present day times, debasing the currency is accomplished in more  subtle means. Since currencies these days are made of only paper,  involving no metal, debasing the currency simply involves printing  additional paper dollars. With the advent of electronic banking, even  this printing press operation is no longer required. The government  simply creates money on a computer screen, literally conjuring it out of  thin air.*
*They are able to accomplish this in one of two ways. One way that they do this is via the* [*Federal Reserve*]( which buys treasury* [*securities*]( *by simply crediting the receivers’ bank accounts with electronically created money. The Federal Reserve then has tangible* [*assets*]( *in* [*Treasury bills*]( *that is it able to trade or sell when it wishes.*
*Another way that this creation of money that debases the currency is  able to be performed is through the Fractional Reserve Banking System.  Since the Federal Reserve only requires banks to keep a ten percent  reserve ratio of deposits on hand, these banks when they are credited  funds from the Federal Reserve are able to loan this new money out in  multiples that are equivalent to the* [*leverage*](  *created by this ten percent only reserve ratio. In both of these ways,  the Federal Reserve is able to create more money quietly and at will.  This is how modern day debasing of the currency is effectively  accomplished.*
Debasing is a valid term as I used it.

You get out, make another mistake and you are back in for even longer.  They can even go after family and business associates if they can show they are facilitating your criminal activity.

Um yes.  You can never do a transaction under KYC.  Nothing over 9,000 for sure.  Even when you use Bitcoin, the recipient may have to record the transaction with your identification.  Any thing that may require a 1099 on either side.  Plus lots of other scenarios.  Once the IRS knows you have done transactions in Bitcoin, they can demand that you provide accounting.  If you have a tax debt, they can use the knowledge that you are hiding assets to jail you.

Ummm... no.  And banking (for all it's problems) is useful.  It moves assets from buyer to seller and lender to borrower and back.  Bitcoin can't move it from one wallet I own to another I own without taking a 2% cut and half an hour (on a $5 transaction).

The Pound was the world currency despite a long history of debasement.  Ditto for Rome and Greece.  Rome was the central world currency despite a long debasement.
Devaluation is not a problem as long as it falls slowly and predictably.
The issue is what is going to replace the dollar?  The Euro had it chance but blew it.  The Mark is gone.  Yen and Swiss Franc too small.  Ruble... um no.  The Chinese Yuan, not in a million years. Any problem you can put on the Dollar, it has in spades with less transparency and full on government engineering.
I think Bitcoin will be in the mix, but in its current state it won't be able to replace any of them.  I think there is a decent chance another state sponsored crypto might be in the mix someday soon.
And finally, the United Nations credit (or unit or insert some sci fi name).  Ummm, I will not hope for that.  Any organization run that poorly can't do anything but fail.

If you have sound monetary policy (Switzerland) you don't need a hard backstop.  If it's crap monetary policy, you have put your chips on currency manipulation.  Switzerland pretty well stands by itself.  Germany is the all time winner.

In investments, the best predictor of the future price, is the current price.  Now this is true for well known, widely and actively traded things.  If people really thought Bitcoin was going to be a million each in a reasonable time period, it's price would be a million less a reasonable deduct for the time value.

There are a great number of industries vital to living that are low margin. If the margin is better via holding a currency, then those industries will not see investment, thus will stagnate and die. In a inflationary economy, holding a asset, even at a low return is preferable to holding currency.  
But the challenge is simple, show a deflationary currency that sparked a growing economy.  The only modern one you can point to is Switzerland.  But there are many issues that make it a bad model.

If cash fails, I have a plan for that and the phone is not a big part of the plan.

At this stage it can absolutely be shut down.  Bitcoin lays on top of Fiat.  At this point it cannot exist without fiat.  Now the real endgame will happen when it is stable (ie no 20% week moves.  Heck no 1% week moves) and starts to threaten a reserve currency.  Then the knives will come out.
But do you think it will survive a coordinated attack by major Western powers?  When governments will trace IP traffic to those processing transactions and tossing people in jail?  Not saying it will happen, but very possible.  Every transaction requires a internet communication to a publically discoverable network.  That can be used against the system if governments decide it is a threat.  Can Venezuela shut it down?  No.  But the G7 (or whatever the number is this year) can.
Remember when Swiss Banks were the vaults to hide your stuff?  Well, that ended too.  And that was a rich, sovereign nation with every incentive to keep it up.  Pressure was applied and they caved.  Start tossing people in jail after a public "information" campaign and they will cave too.  Nobody is going to jail to save Bitcoin.

But to bitcoin... it is aweful hard to have a robust payment system when the government is actively going after the infrastructure.  Devices have to talk to other devices doing the processing.

I think Bitcoin has a real floor as long as it works.  It is reasonable to set it in the thousands.  If it never moons, there is little incentive to create a better coin but there will be a need for magic internet money.  If for no other reason than to buy pills or pay ransomware.

There are very few crimes that are just money.  Money is the facilitator for other crimes.  So go out and arrest them doing the thing that is actually a crime and stop making trade more and more difficult.
Second point, Bitcoin has an exhaustive register of every transaction.  So it is a poor way to hide transactions if you can trace a transaction to a person/account. Between IP tracking, the register and access to exchanges to convert it, there are tools to deal with crime.

No, the use drives the price, not the other way around.  More use higher price, lower use lower price.  Higher prices drive speculation, but that is a wash in the long run even if it can produce spikes in the short and medium term.

The French did not "bail us out".  The French funded someone who was giving their enemy a hard time.  They did not care if we became free, died on the gallows or muddled along for a hundred years.  As long as the fight was on, England was weaker and they were stronger.  A bonus was the more Brits/Americans that died in the New World the fewer people that were able to fight the French in the next new world war.  The French King certainly did not do it for the Republic principals the American Revolution represented.  The French Revolution came after the American one.

The only counter scenario I can see is if it gets adopted as a fast way to move money out of a nation/market by a significant number of rick people.
But for it to grow via the masses, it has to get a lot easier to use and manage.  And that will probably take regulated, licensed, insured exchanges that generate a good reputation over a decade of use.

Yea, because they have kidnapped so many world leaders and destroyed so many countries.  No, what actually happens is that there are many nations who have crap currencies.  To facilitate trade, they use Gold to back up transactions and the gold moves around the vault on daily basis (via paper, not physically for the most part).  Who in the heck would take Venezuela currency for any trade.  The problem became worse when Venezuela could not deliver oil to get hard currency to balance the accounts.
I'd bet dollars to donuts that every scrap of gold in London banks has already been used to settle trade with Venezuela unable to square the trade with oil deliveries.  There is nothing left for Venezuela to repatriate.

Its a sidechannel that facilitates a connection to the internet.  A sidechannel that requires a dish.  
Oh and check out their " Liquid is an innovative sidechain built on the  Bitcoin network, facilitating faster bitcoin transactions between  businesses and individuals, while enabling extended functionality. Some  of the features of Liquid include:
Liquid's native Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC) asset  is backed by a two-way peg to Bitcoin (BTC) and can be redeemed at any  time, providing institutions and end users with a secure and rapid way  to transfer bitcoin between members with full settlement in two minutes. "  
I think I might detect the smell of a shitcoin.  So if you are sidechanneling in a shitcoin on a private network that is connected to the internet... well you point falls flat.  
And paper wallets are off line.  Not on the internet.  No transaction from a paper wallet can be confirmed until you are online with the wallet.  
I don't know what your problem is. Bitcoin is a digital currency that is dependent on the internet.  Period.  Not a problem, it's a feature.  You might have side channels, but for them to work, they have to connect to the internet at some point in the process.  And also, depending on side channels for transaction processing might be useful, but it breaks the trust less features of Bitcoin... IE it is just an exchange with it's own communication protocol and in your case, probably it's own non bitcoin crypto currency.

I think that Bitcoin makes it possible (but extremely unlikely) for this to happen.  For a currency to crater, it needs to have something to measure against.  Since the Dollar is the reserve currency of the world, it is the measuring stick to other currencies.  In the Roman era it was Gold (they debased silver coinage physically).  For the Brits (when they were the reserve) it was paper vs silver.  
In a Dollar vs Bitcoin world, the standard of Bitcoin could provide the measure to show the dollar's debasement.  
I think this is extremely unlikely, but possible.

Bitcoin is not a fix the world solution.  It is just a new money, not that different from all the old monies.  You earn it through work, you spend it on things, rinse, repeat. There is nothing bad happening now that can't happen under a bitcoin monied world.  Banks will make loans in bitcoin and charge interest.  People will spend foolishly.  People will desire power over others.  People will hoard it and want more.  In the end it is just a flat world sitting on an endless pile of people.

TOR is...
"The core principle of Tor, "onion routing", was developed in the mid-1990s by United States Naval Research Laboratory employees, mathematician Paul Syverson, and computer scientists Michael G. Reed and David Goldschlag, with the purpose of protecting U.S. intelligence communications online. Onion routing was further developed by DARPA in 1997.[20][21][22]
The alpha version of Tor, developed by Syverson and computer scientists Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson[18] and then called The Onion Routing project, or TOR project, launched on 20 September 2002.[1][23] The first public release occurred a year later.[24] On 13 August 2004, Syverson, Dingledine, and Mathewson presented "Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router" at the 13th USENIX Security Symposium.[25] In 2004, the Naval Research Laboratory released the code for Tor under a free license, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) began funding Dingledine and Mathewson to continue its development.[18]
In December 2006, Dingledine, Mathewson, and five others founded The Tor Project, a Massachusetts-based 501(c)(3) research-education nonprofit organization responsible for maintaining Tor.[26] The EFF acted as The Tor Project's fiscal sponsor in its early years, and early financial supporters of The Tor Project included the U.S. International Broadcasting Bureau, Internews, Human Rights Watch, the University of Cambridge, Google, and Netherlands-based Stichting NLnet.[27][28][29][30][31]
From this period onward, the majority of funding sources came from the U.S. government.[18]"

The Greeks minted coinage with lower and lower silver until it basically had none.  Devaluing fiat currency is very old.  Greeks did it. Romans did it.  I am sure the Babylonians, Egyptians and many others did it too.  The big issue was almost always when the government made actual silver and gold illegal for trade to prop up the fiat.  As long as western governments allow free trade in Silver, gold and other commodities, you have an outlet.
Of course one could argue that the government is manipulating gold and sliver through proxies in the future/options markets... but that is a big discussion all it's own.

It might get stronger each cycle, but it could also get weaker each cycle.

A farmer can decide not to invest in more farm equipment to replace worn equipment because he gets a better return HODL.  Farm productivity falls.  
An investor decides not to invest in a apartment building to HODL.  So the demand is not met until market rent rates soar to make it attractive to invest.
People won't take out loans because the 5 Bitcoin you owe for buying the house, in 10 years might represent a lifetime of work and you can't pay it back.  But the house is only worth 2 bitcoins then.  You still owe 3.
People would be extremely unwilling to give an appreciating asset, Bitcoin, to buy anything.  Economic turnover falls, jobs are lost and work dries up.

Because it has no intrinsic value.  It can be worth zero, or it can be worth an elephant.  Other things have a value based on a property.  Gold will always have a value as a product with useful properties.  A bushel of wheat the same.  Those products as long as they remain useful have a value greater than zero.  That reduces risk by providing a floor.
Now imagine a product with a negative intrinsic value, like nuclear waste.  If it were to become a currency, it might have a currency value, but if it ceased to be valuable as a currency, it would still have a negative value.  Therefore it would be even riskier.
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:53:20

Yea, bookmark this.  NASA has shown a lack of competence in anything but building it's bureaucracy since the 70's.  The idea we are going to the moon to harvest water is laughable.  The amount of material you would have to process to get the trace amounts of frozen water in the ground boggles the mind.
Even more so when it's in a vacuum, 15 days of power then 15 days of dark, and we have no idea what mining it would be like.  Will it be earthmoving (could be done but not at that scale) or will it have to be like every other large scale mine on the earth and use explosives (quite impossible).  We going to send up some 50 ton trucks, a few front end loaders and excavators with a bulldozer or two to move a city's worth of moon dust to get a tank of water?  Its not like you are going to drill a shaft and get a gusher of water.
Maybe they will underground mine.  But you still end up with the problems of geology.  Any mining of that sort uses tons of explosives and is dangerous on mother earth, much less there.  Literally hundreds of roof bolts are needed each week.  And that is if you have a good back.  If it is a bad back that is thousands and now you need concrete and rebar to shore up the shaft.
So you get your tank of water.  And you split it for fuel and O2 (vast solar panel fields needed).  Now what.  It still has to get to orbit to be useful, and when it's in orbit now what.  Plus the whole problem of having a city of miners living underground except during your workshift.  Coal miners have it bad being underground 8/10 hours a day.  Imagine being underground 16 hours a day.  All consuming food and other resources that have to be shipped from earth.

I have no particular definition.  Just the general concept of using bitcoin instead of government issued money, maybe with BTC becoming prevalent.

Very unlikely, but many here think its inevitable.

And I tried to figure out what the bitcoin people do in their happy hour and I finally figured it out: They celebrate the life and work of Judas Iscariot.”
The point he made well was that Bitcoin people were at the Berkshire annual meeting and want to spend time with Munger/Buffett who are Judas...to many in this Reddit.  He was not calling Bitcoin people Judas.

Banks fueled buyers with easy loans.  Demand.  Banks stopped.  Demand cratered.  Supply of houses was always there and in towns where supply was limited, the price exploded from increased demand.  It was a demand price crash.
Student loan.  Demand comes from unlimited supplies of loans.  Supply demand.
Laundered money will happen on Bitcoin and probably is now.  It sure did on via silk road.
And even if all said here was accurate, this particular Bitcoin price crash is demand driven.
