so ... what do you do with all of the money locked up in bitcoin?  And do you ever buy LiteCoin or Ethereum ?

Me too: 
Let me know if you find anything about the bandwidth.
It seems that the number of servers is around 45, but I could be wrong.
As for hosts, I'm pretty sure that a headless linux server (I'd use Ubuntu) is the way to go.

I use a raspberry pi cold storage. Cold storage is a bit slow though, and I can only use it at home. 
The question is: what am I more scared of? Losing bitcoins that are stored on an exchange or losing my electrum seed phrase or having someone steal my RPi and take my bitcoins.  Storing things in exchanges and on the cloud seems quite insecure to me. Exchanges get robbed fairly regularly.  So what I have is a microSD card that I store safely somewhere and then I just boot it up on that when I need to; then use a USB to transfer the transactions across.  
If I wanted to do something on the go, I'd probably just use my cold storage RPi to transfer $50 or $100 to a paper wallet and use that.  But I don't have a lot of bitcoin and am not a poweruser.

And my idiot bank only allows 12 characters max for online banking. 
And my debit card pin is limited to 4 digits! That's ludicrous.

I think I'm going to stick with Electrum 2.6 for a while.

There doesn't seem to be much documentation on the new changes nor the rationale for them. It's disappointing.

Apparently coinomi uses Shapeshift.io to exchange coins, so you could just use them directly as your exchange.

Hey, what are you going to do with your bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:31:18
OP have you tried localbitcoins.com?

Thanks. Re 1. Would the Argentine govt. know that you are converting BTC to USD?
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:09:20
1. Could Argentinan's just buy bitcoins one day and then sell them for US dollars the next? If not why not?
2. Since this currency has only been around for 4 years and the originator is unknown, is there a chance that next year a backdoor will be revealed which allows the creator to grab everyone's bitcoins?  If this is impossible, please explain why.
Thanks.
