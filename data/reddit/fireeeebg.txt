Miners fees. Like the money that you pay to the validator.

If everyone starts using Bitcoin the fees will go to a 1000$ per transaction. So Bitcoin is highly unlikely to become the world currency. It is going to be the digital gold of the world. Ethereum or ripple are the candidates for now but that might change in a blink of an eye when something better comes along.

Banks own Bitcoin. You ain't overthrowing anything. Who do you think will profit from lightning network hubs - banks.

Not exactly correct. To be hub on the ln you need to have the amount into your account. For example if you want to be hub for 100btc transfer you need to have 100btc locked. Do you have 100btc? If not you are not qualified for that transaction. Who is? The banks.

Yet another undertaker of Bitcoin. Count them by the million soon.

Much sooner my friend. Just take a look at DJI and s&amp;p500. All the cash will go to gold and Bitcoin.

I'm not an US citizen but in my opinion Trump is not someone who will stick to his promises. And that assumption is based on facts.  Just saying.
