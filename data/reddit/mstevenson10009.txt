Ya, one had his Litecoin buy not show up for hours and now just shows pending. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:00:42
My one buy will finally be fixed. ;) Its been sitting in the pending limbo for two weeks like my friends on here. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:57:26
Show them how to get it themselves 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:08:40
you still do good, sad you didn't get to respond to caller after you left. People still think this is stock or the gov dollar.  haha
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:43:59
Yep, network fees are high right now

@_date: 2017-12-08 21:40:12
lol, full joke, pretending I was CNN lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:50:44
I did the verification on the Coinbase app. Worked better with cell camera than web cam. They are backed up. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:52:21
And the sky is blue, soooo, leave us alone and go print your money.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:12:25
They came out in 2015 stating you pay capital gains on them so it's not currency but you can't take a loss so that sounds like regs to me
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:30:46
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:39:26
same company 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:33:57
Coinbase or bitPay
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:45:25
Bitcoin.com is Bitcoin Cash, not true bitcoin. Bitcoin.org is Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:18:58
I felt the same way buying at $800 and it went to $400. I sold some at a loss.
Now let that sink in. :)

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:07:30
in the most part
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:23:53
The more gov info you give to Coinbase, the more you can buy so they can track you and tax you someday if needed. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:26:26
no way to know,  if you send it back from sending address,  that could just be an exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:10:11
Sounds like slippage but the slippage could be also because of the outage you seen. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:11:12
I had that in there but it was removed. Good idea, 
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:31:41

@_date: 2017-12-12 03:15:51
They made a fork and it was not picked up by the miners.  Yep,  works that way. So?
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:28:25
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:20:26
Need more info, Market Order or other and was it slippage.? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:09:19
I get mine in less than 24 hours but I bet 4 to 7 days at most
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:26:56

From GDAX, $0 fee as I did a Limit trade into USD and than a withdrawal to bank but I am in the US
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:57:32
Use Coinbase app to verify with.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:40:37
Fake News
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:35:20
because you can't talk about price in r/bitcoin anymore. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:25:48
* Never answered the Ponzi question 
* You gave a fee info on Coinbase but you didn't tall them about miners get fee on open ledgers 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:34:36
you pay taxes on all gains, no matter what 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:53:40
no limit,  depends on memepool. If running core, anything not confirmed in 72 hours should be sent back as larger fee gets priority 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:03:44
top right, go to Account, and look under USD and it will give you the date and UTC time for it to deposit. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:41:10
They pay the fee
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:09:55

But US ruled, crypto can't take a loss :( in 2015, only gains

@_date: 2017-12-16 07:50:05
Blame the US gov. not coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:09:53
May just go back to Simplex as to bad address.

@_date: 2017-12-11 18:33:49
Exchanges will give you the same yearly report you than give to your tax person just like Robonhood does now in the USA is what i soon see.  1099 is stupid 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:16:49
Look under GDAX, Accounts
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:41:51
You can do that on all the Exchanges,  if in USA, look at GDAX.com, owned by Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:43:44

@_date: 2017-12-13 20:50:02
Move Bitcoin to GDAX (it's free), sell your bitcoin as limit order (post), move funds to your bank
(You will need to verify your account and add in your bank info)
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:43:32
why would it? Until you receive capital, you don't have taxes. Transfer into USD or buy with it, than you have gains. 
The IRS was and is looking for anyone that had converted Bitcoin or others Crypto into USD at a gain. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:12:19
just go to nice hash and get your $0.03 a week.  it's fun

@_date: 2017-12-15 01:09:56
Price rise and transaction fees from the start of 2017 to the end.  Google Bitcoin memepool fees. Maybe another Crypto has or will have become the main currency as to fees
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:39:35
let's do this.

make about $1 or less a month. Mining is a Hobby at home unless you do crypto GPU mining at home, may make more and depends on your electricity cost and if prices keep rising to offset difficulty changes 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:02:32
1. Tether
2. BitConnect 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:09:05
That is what I was thinking. I told them to look into it
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:55:52
Bitcoin, ya, it's going to take time, I use Litcoin
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:30:32
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:02:01
years ago, if you emailed bitcoin from coinbase, if they didn't redeem bitcoin, coinbase would give it back to you in about 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:47:01
yes, block chain has fees
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:59:28
You can email it from Coinbase I believe still and if they don't take it, it comes back weeks later. I tried this in 2014 but all came back as to everyone thinking it as not real anything
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:54:17

ya but LTC is faster
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:08:19
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:31:23
I think they are having scaling issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:57:25
I don't think they have the people as 100,000 a day join sooooo. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:05:55
As soon as transfers slow down. Everyone bitches but they keep paying them so they stay high
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:58:51
Coinbase paid the fee's years ago but no longer but GDAX is the same company, 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:12:08
Order book is different as they are two different exchanges with a different set of people. Question should be, how do two exchanges have close to the same price?
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:51:46
in in the US and from Coinbase, move from coinbase to GDAX, from GDAX to Gyft app and buy a gift card to fast food. No fee's!!
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:03:36

@_date: 2017-12-13 00:18:11
GDAX is paying the fee, you will see it when you now move it from new exchanges unless they pay it
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:56:02
I remember .05 was just $5
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:40
They auto Canceled all my sell orders :( 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:06:37
Does that include all the machines at every check out?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:57:15

Market manipulation, they canceled it, never wanted to sell, hoped to push market up or down.

@_date: 2017-12-08 04:54:54
It's safe, it how they get the USA to tax you and verify you are you
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:41:12
no 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:44:34
Price was crashing,  maybe they took exchange off line to stop the crash
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:26:27
And he said Mt GOX was all good, than it closed down and cost everyone their bitcoin, lost forever.

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:18

@_date: 2017-12-13 15:13:42
and cost. highest get priority 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:47:22
You need to use your own wallets to buy stuff with Bitcoin,  sending from an exchange is taking Bitcoin off their system,  than sending into block chain,  and then to your Purchase.  
Also fees are high right know as to the hype so not good. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:28:48

@_date: 2017-12-16 05:13:43
no, you will need separate wallets 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:54:44
If your bank is in their system, it helps but you can just do a check routing info but that will delay it. Use Coinbase for over 4 years and with my bank info with no issue. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:14:59
stay away from blockchain wallet.  If small amount,  just leave on Coinbase or if you plan to hold, move onto a paper wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:30:04
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:42:16

@_date: 2014-02-14 02:34:56
As I understand it, it is to be sent back to sender. I have never seen it and the mining pools want the 25 BTC so I think their programs are processing almost all transactions no mater what but also, without a fee or low fee, your put at the back of the line also so your transaction could take longer and if your purchasing something or trading in a Walmart parking lot (don't do this), you don't want to stand around waiting. 
I think Coinbase issues are that they try to combined small transactions to limit this fee on their end so their BTC transactions sometimes are slow also.
@_date: 2014-10-27 23:38:30

*3. Pushing the Limit*
This transaction just barely qualified as being free. It's 9999 bytes long, which is the biggest a transaction can be without requiring a fee. **Notice also that all but one of the inputs are only 10 nXBT (0.00000001 XBT); the single large input that was included with them was big enough to bring its priority up enough to make it free.**

(from page)
Always require * (most secure)  * 100.00 USD (0.1154 BTC)
In order to protect your coins, we require you to enter a verfication code after sending more than a certain amount in a 24 hour period. The default is to require verification after sending an equivalent of 100 USD. If you want to further secure your coins, you can have us always require verification.
Remember send verification for:
* Never (most secure) * 10 minutes * 1 hour * 24 hours
When you send more than the limit set above, we ask for a verification code. This setting will determine how long before we will ask for your verification code again. 
Warning: Increasing this value will reduce the security of your coins

Had over 5,000 views come here yesterday and some bitcoiners freaked and scared them away and some buttcoiners also went crazy.
I know first hand. I have been told I am a spammer and shill but I am just a noob in part spending my own money trying to teach and help and spent my own money and time making a free info website and even just started a bitcoin meetup on my own dime. Anytime someone states my website is wrong, I do even more research and only change it once I know that maybe I am wrong. 
Maybe I am just too pushy trying to help but I have a lot of PM's from noobs newer them me thanking me that I help them a lot so I keep going.
edit: Not going to name the buttcoiner that hounds me every time I post or comment. He should be coming out of the woods soon to call me a shill once more. :)  Stay tooned

The $10,000 changed after 9/11. 
Now all activities are reported.  $3,000 is one of the true report ing numbers but each bank has their own policy.  The credit union will be easier to deal on bitcoin but as you are buying and selling on the street,  they will also report your activities.  If in the US and depending on your state somewhat,  you will also be considered a money transferer and you need to follow all BSA, Patriot ACT, KYC, and AML and be registered with Fincen.

Tried it and didn't like it so I stopped a long time ago.
Just some simple advertising anyways and it worked. Talked to a friend I have not seen in 15 years, met two new friends and we started the meetup group with the first meeting this weekend. 
Site did what I wanted. I paid for the site, meetup.com cost, and sent bitcoin and other merchandise on my dime to others.
Also, I see way more spam from others that are making money from this sub but I like it as I find more places to spend my hard earned money at. I have given more away and even any tips I get, I have given them away also.
Your post to Buttcoin and Trolling here should by now have gotten you banned from this site but do I report you, **NO**, as I respect all.

candlesticks with long lower shadows and short upper shadows indicate that sellers dominated during the session and drove prices lower. However, buyers later resurfaced to bid prices higher by the end of the session and the strong close created a long lower shadow.

* Gyft will give a 3% discount using bitcoin
* Bitcoin keeps the merchant from holding / receiving your credit card info and the potential in losing it to hakers. (Target comes to mind)
* Bitcoin lets you use cash over the Internet. (Lose definition)
* with supplies like Coinbase.com in the USA, % to buy bitcoin is less then you state.

If they (wall street / banks) are too stupid to know the differences from truth, facts, rumors, and the such, than we are doomed.
I never stop educating myself on all before I invest. Just like I didn't buy El Pollo Loco stock knowing they are in the hole for $228 mil. and lost money over the last three years even as their IPO gained over 60% the fist day.

So what starts as they are frustrated with Coinbase not having apple app or website POS like Bitpay. I know use DC POS but now you have to sign up for two services to get something.
Bitpay is falling as the web page POS can be switched by an employee simply signing up on his own and using his web link. Bitpay needs to start  password log-in type system like DC POS
The Tip function on both suck. Just ask for percentage and not dollar amounts.
The wallets need fixed. Most issues I see are people using blockchain.info cell wallet and transactions are held up for hours. Wallet like Mycelium does not have this issue but they don't have the cash to make an iOS app and blockchain.info is still lacking on the app store.
Coinbase wallet is very, very bad for store buys. It will not send as coinbase does not always have the coins available to send instantly as most are off line and if you mess-up a transaction, coinbase will not send a second one until the first has confirmed at least 1 block.
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:30:47

But, on the other hand, BTC is more, much more, then a type of money. It is a protocol,  commodity,  money, and such, so yes, it is different is sorts.  This is why I believe in bitcoin

Yes, if you recharge with Coinbase.com like I do, then yes, you may pay about $0.35 more as Coinbase.com exchange rate is less.  
I think the $0.40 +/- is a lot better then $25 a month and other issues using Credit Cards.  
One of the largest questions is; Why use bitcoin to purchase with? 
As more and more personal financial data is now transferred and held buy small and large companies including retail stores. Security from hackers and fraud have not kept up to protect your financial identity. To help protect your financial identity you are asked to buy identity theft protection, make unique passwords, temporary credit card numbers per purchase offered by some credit card companies, security pictures, security questions and answers, and pin numbers. With all of these security measures you are now requested and required to buy or give but even after this, you still rely on individual companies to protect your financial identity within their servers. This cost you time and money and time is money.

Coinbase is protecting themselves from ACH cancelation. In the US, an ACH transfer can take a week or more. You do get the bitcoin at market value at the time you hit buy but you don't get the coin for 4 to 10 days as it is your banks fault. 
If you give Coinbase a visa backup card, you can get instant Bitcoin buys. They never use your credit card unless you don't have the cash in your bank some 4 to 10 days later. If they do need to charge your credit card, they will and then suspend your Coinbase account until you convince them you will never let it happen aagain but good luck with that.

Coinbase app shows like three places and hides the other 5 and it sucks and need to log onto the internet to see the full 8 places. I bet it works 99.999% of the time so they don't think it is a big deal. I would find their  lamassu support number / email and send then any and all information you have. 
I still bet it's rounding issue even past 8 places. I had one like this long ago and it had nothing to do with  lamassu but I am not a dev. so I have no idea realy

He can then set-up a bitcoin wallet if he wants to keep any of the bitcoin. Not a Canada expert but only until he cashes out the bitcoin if he holds will be taxed. Not an issue if he goes from bitcoin to fiat at time of customer purchase

On 6 August 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted. Transactions weren't properly verified before they were included in the transaction log or "block chain" which let users bypass Bitcoin's economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins.[15][16] On 15 August, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the Bitcoin protocol.[17][18] This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.[15][16]

After using many spending bitcoin cell phone wallets, we started using the Mycelium Wallet as to its ease of use, you hold your own private keys, and you can make a paper wallet backup so if your phone becomes damaged or lost, you do not lose your bitcoins. 
This wallet also lets you import a paper wallet by selecting Cold Storage under the menu button. Mycelium states it will forward your bitcoin change back to the phone / paper wallet so you do not need to remove the full bitcoins from the paper wallet. We still do not recommend this unless you understand it but this is a very nice feature. We have recommended you never throw away an old paper wallet even if it is spent. 
As always, this is not an endorsement as you should review each wallet and make up your own mind but we would like to pass this review onto you. 
The Mycelium wallet as of today has never let us down. As long as you have data coverage, transactions always confirm. We recommend that you learn about the wallet and go into settings and Set a Pin Code. You should also Disable Local Trader in the settings if you are not going to use this feature. We do not use Local Trader at this time and cannot review it.
At this time of the writing this blog, Mycelium does not support new bitcoin address for every transaction or Multi-signature bitcoin addresses. Also, Mycelium by default, adds the 0.0001 or more depending on the transaction size

I use bitcoin to purchase with all the time. It is about 0.0001 as depending on the transaction size. App wallet like Mycelium automatically calculates it. You can set this low or 0 on a computer wallet but it takes longer as most mining pools do not take 0 fee transactions.

Mycelium adjust on your end per transaction size of your transfer.  This way your better at not getting dropped by the miners.  This is like posing,  "my transfer has still not confirmed after 4 hours" and we come to mind out they set 0 fees. 
They can't risk the bad PR so they follow true bitcoin rules and keep you from changing it

1. Copy your Gyft Card code.

3. Paste your Gyft Card code into the Promo Code box and validate.
4. Complete the payment process.

One has not been to court yet. Don't forget, incident before proven guilty. He also founded the org. Did you? Did he do bad things, maybe.
The other never been to any meetings. He did give them the bitcoin websites and money so I think he was on the board by default, nothing more and made the first bitcoin exchange. I know, did it badly, very badly but what did you do for bitcoin 3to 5 years ago?.

Pics too high but thanks for the help. It was helpful
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:24:49
You don't need to give fee's but the blockchain / bitcoin has made the standard fee .0001. It's in the program. Anything less may never get confirmed. As of today, almost all still get confirmed (not including the dust of .00000001 that is going around) but it's a risk. 
As a business, you can't take this risk. Coinbase is still a start-up and can not. Now, they don't charge you this .0002 so your in luck. Just think of the exchanges that charge you .001 and you will feel your lucky./

Take it from a skateboarder from the 80s
This is how it will go;
Like the 70s, all will embrace then someone gets hurt and sues. All shut down as to fear of lawsuit even we all know its fear mongering.  So the kids of the 80s suffer. The kids never forget so when they grow up, skate parks start to open back up as the old 80s people are too old and no longer in control. 
Bitcoin will be the same, just hope faster.

I think you are talking about a "run on the bank". I don't think the US has the power to do this for the full country but for one small bank, maybe. 
Why do banks leave their vault doors open? Long ago, people worried the bank did not have the cash on hand, so the bank would put in a crate or barrow in the vault with cash showing in the crate over flowing. What people did not know, the crate or barrow was realy full of rocks or straw and not full of cash so if they did do a run on the bank, the bank would fail. 
The US banking system has changed that this can never happen

just sent to verify you are not a money launder. Every one thinks you don't get told on but only if you go over $10,000 but after 9/11, this is no longer true. banks don't know what Coinbase is and just need to verify all is well. no big deal.

The Gov has caused most of this issue.
 It should not give you the option not to pay the miner fee or they pay it for you like Coinbase does.
 It should list what exchange they get the price from and list their fees and mark up separately from this price

So do you ask or not ask? I remember over 10 years ago when my favorite stores would not take credit cards / debt card as I hated the change in coins I would get after each purchase. I would ask them than, why not now?. Now I hate the unsanitary cards I get handed back to me and the hacking.  Bitcoin or no bitcoin, something needs to be fixed now.

The issue is people will heavily invest in doge thinking the price will, so to speak "go to the moon" but if I understand doge, it has unlimited amout of coin that will never end getting created so the price will never get that high so it will turn off people from crytocoin in the future .
I hope they just play with doge but invest in something like bitcoin.
Love the doge community.  Just hope doge is not the Myspace of crytocoins.

Need to send an Executive Summary. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:40:46
After using many spending bitcoin cell phone wallets, we started using the Mycelium Wallet as to its ease of use, you hold your own private keys, and you can make a paper wallet backup so if your phone becomes damaged or lost, you do not lose your bitcoins. 
This wallet also lets you import a paper wallet by selecting Cold Storage under the menu button. Mycelium states it will forward your bitcoin change back to the phone / paper wallet so you do not need to remove the full bitcoins from the paper wallet. We still do not recommend this unless you understand it but this is a very nice feature. We have recommended you never throw away an old paper wallet even if it is spent. 
As always, this is not an endorsement as you should review each wallet and make up your own mind but we would like to pass this review onto you. 
The Mycelium wallet as of today has never let us down. As long as you have data coverage, transactions always confirm. We recommend that you learn about the wallet and go into settings and Set a Pin Code. You should also Disable Local Trader in the settings if you are not going to use this feature. We do not use Local Trader at this time and cannot review it.
At this time of the writing this blog, Mycelium does not support new bitcoin address for every transaction or Multi-signature bitcoin addresses. Also, Mycelium by default, adds the 0.0001 or more depending on the transaction size

I like that Coinbase is open to it.  I see your brand issue but I leave that to the company to decide.  Apple and Google also add the developer to the title of the list and if your too stupid to see a name and not Coinbase.com under the app name then they need turn off their phone or table and and go get educated but I see your point. 
When Coinbase get their app on Apple. What is taking so long?

Enter the transaction into you systems like cash and then open the website link from a shortcut and enter the amount and then they pay.

On 6 August 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted. Transactions weren't properly verified before they were included in the transaction log or "block chain" which let users bypass Bitcoin's economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins.[15][16] On 15 August, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the Bitcoin protocol.[17][18] This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.[15][16]

Wallet Security will be btcoins downfall if this is not worked out very very soon. The full paper / private key / disconnect from web / don't use Coinbase for everyday purchases and stuff will keep people away. Most here would say good but more users loose their BTC, the word gets out and then it all doomed. Just my opinion.

Go with BitPay.com. you take the "check out" web site link they give you and save a short cut to it if you use a computer for a point of sale. BitPay will convert 100% of the Bitcoin to USD if you want it to. 
Need some info from you.
* what is your point of sale system?
* do you want to keep any bitcoin?
* will you be the first in your town?
You will save the cost of the high fee's from accepting credit cards so most now offer a discount when they use Bitcoin
I like to use Bitcoin as I don't carry cash and don't need you or your payment company to keep my cc     info safe
If you want to buy Bitcoin, go to Coinbase.com

Dogecoin was mainly started out of a joke and based off the Litecoin framework. Dogecoin was copied by a reddit.com  [meme]( of a [Shiba Inu]( dog and the name Doge sound is pulled, in part, from a [hand puppet cartoon]( 
The [Dogecoin community]( has gained popularity as to the low cost of Dogecoins and support they have given to multiple endeavors like the [Jamaican bobsleigh team]( and [Nascar](  
Dogecoin does not have a cap on the amount of coin that can be mined so it is considered [inflationary]( As like the US Dollar, the price may drop or have less buying power over time as to the unlimited amount of Dogecoins getting produced each year.
Some believe Dogecoin is the Myspace type crytocoin and will lose popularity over time like Myspace has due to the [inflationary]( state of the coin and may turn people off of other Altcoins and Bitcoin and as Dogecoin may never rise in price like other altcoins have in the past. It’s remains to be seen but at this time, join the fun! 
[Watch a Dogecoin video here](

I feel for them but some feel bitcoin is a token and send it to anyone (exchanges) without understanding the exchange, company, persons and then when they are taken, now it's money to them. 
I walk up to them and say, give me your bitcoin and you can get or do this and that, and they say OK. Now go to the same person and say, give me your cash for this and that and they say, no way. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 03:00:12

It is dropping so as to let me buy more. Bitcoin knew it was costing me too much so I asked it to help me out and it said "ok". What a nice coin bitcoin is. I guess I will keep it and feed it USD and give it a nice new home for now. It did tell me a secret, it said "my price will go up in the future, so don't stand there like a fool, buy me now". Got to go now, little bitcoin is calling. Need to spend time with it as it is only 5 and one day it will grow and I will miss these days when I look back. Ahhh

OK, OK, how would anyone know. I did a prediction of $400 in August the $2,000 buy the end of the year. LoL 
I still think the $400 but until confidence is put back into bitcoin and USA / China gives better info into tax and regulations, the $2,000 prodiction may not happen.

*Invalid Transaction Broadcasting*
Bitcoin transactions reassign an incoming transaction from one address (the “vin” of the new transaction) to a recipient address (the “vout”). There was an error in 0.8.5 that caused certain transactions to be broadcast with a vin of 0. As a clearly invalid transaction, the nodes inadvertently broadcasting them were being blocked. The solution appears to have been discovered and solved by Wladimir J. van der Laan who identified a faulty logic statement. When none of the conditions of the if statement were met, an empty transaction was stored and broadcast. The 0.8.6 update contains a patch that resolves this bug by adding a ‘continue’ clause to the end which prevents 0 vin transactions.

Mycelium has you make a paper wallet with it's app for back-up and protected with a code. It also has in it's setting a pass code. Now if you lose your phone, you just add in the paper wallet with code and add to your next phone and the lost phone can not spend your coin without the pass code. If you have android phone, you should try it.

Logic. If people think bitcoin would be $2,000 in Jan 2015, then the price would be $2,000 today. if people think bitcoin will be $2.15 in June of 2016 the bitcoin would be $2.15 today. I guess everyone thinks bitcoin is about $580 right now so it must be they think this is what it will be in 1, 2, or 10 years. 
Now in a year, if everyone thinks bitcoin is say $810, than that is what they think it is at that time.
What is your game plan? Do you want all the traders to sell right now because of what My Gox may or may not have done? Bitcoin is not a stock market and will never be. There will always be exchanges playing some type of dirty pool until they are decentralized.

Will Coinbase tell how many have bank accounts tied to the wallets? I bet its less then you think. I know some use more then one Coinbase wallet. One to buy from with bank account and one to hold BTC with. I still don't feel this is a good but people do with what they want.

Wallet is just a wallet (most do not recommend keeping your coins under other peoples / or companies control. ie Mt. Gox.). If you need a hot wallet to spend with, use one that you control the private key.
Vault is like a savings account designed to take time to get the coin out. I guess it was designed to help you secure your coin so if a hacker breaks into Coinbase, you may have time to get Coinbase to stop the hack if you are lucky.

In the past, I would tell people, don't buy from any company online unless you trust them with your CC info. Never did I say, they may not ship your items. I would shy from small online companies because of this. yes, they may not ship my $5 to $45 purchase but steal my $10,000+ credit card info. yes, most protect you but still the hassle of stealing your CC info is a pain
Now I only risk them shipping my stuff and at this time, everyone that takes bitcoin has shipped. Example:

Yes, bitcoin is 5 years old but still new and small. It does need more security. 
I don't know is regulation and/or third party insurance is they way to go but it may be something to look at.
bitcoin reminds me in part of a bank in the 1800's. and bitcoin someday will get to the 1900's and 2000's, it just takes time just hope it's is sooner then later.

I have had the same issue but how much gold is lost? Bitcoin is still an experiment that may not play out for over 100 years to know if this was right. I myself believe in bitcoin and will. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:48:20
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:22:38
Problem scenarios:
Some people use Bitcoin for receiving compensations for incredibly small workloads (e.g. clicking on an ad).
Some services misuse transactions as a messaging system (e.g. lost bets).
You should know that each payment under 0.01 BTC requires a fee of at least 0.0005 BTC. That means if you are receiving a payment of 0.0005 BTC or below, you will not be able to economically spend it!
Now, what about aggregating several 0.0005 BTC payments in one transaction? For example, you could spend 0.0005 BTC * 4 = 0.002 BTC. Problem here: The fee is 0.0005 per kilobyte, and aggregating builds larger (in bytes) transactions. You can roughly aggregate 5 transactions with a 0.0005 BTC fee.
So, as a general rule of thumb:
**You should refrain from receiving payments smaller than 0.0001 BTC. We call them dust.**
Note that these numbers will change over time, as Bitcoin value rises and falls and fee rules get adapted. Until then however, dust just uses up precious memory, making everything slower than it should be. Or, in extreme cases, causes running out of memory.

* list in BTC, mBTC, and uBTC on the screen
* setup a website like Coinbase for pre atherization befor driving to the ATM
* list the exchange they get the price from or list more then one exchange
* list all the fees separately from the BTC price
* Robocoin needs to pay the miner fee to buy and sell
* they need to have their own app and/or print true paper wallets

*How can sending money be spam?*
We need to keep in mind that a single satoshi does not have any real value (yet). If you are sending a single satoshi today, you are really only transacting a value of ~$0.000001. Even the proposed dust threshold equals little more than half a cent($).
**The recent history has shown that there are few malevolent individuals who are sending satoshi transactions to non-existent receivers, just to embed some bytes of rubbish on the network.** That’s real bitcoin spam. It hurts the credibility of bitcoin and potentially slows down legitimate transactions.
Bitcoin transactions do require a transaction fee already, which is in part also supposed to limit these spam transactions, but it is still fairly easy to circumvent these fees if you know your ways. A dust threshold on the network will make undertakings like these much more pricey and hopefully helps keeping spam off the network all together

Why think of bitcoin as a bank account, credit card, check card, debt cart, or check, It is not.. bitcoin is the same as cash. No exchange is a bank, no mater what they say. A bitcoin exchange or a online wallet is just that and not secured by anything. Most have not known the world without this (so called) insurance they get from banks today so no one understands that they are personally responsible for their money.
You may not pay but someone invest in that bank and they are paying by stock price lower or less dividends. It could be someone paying a high interest for a loan or not getting a loan. You may work someplace and them not getting that loan as to the theft of all the credit cards keep some from getting loans and now they don't purchase from you or your company so you don't get a raise or may even lose your job. So you will pay for that theft, you just don't see it.

Bitcoin has a maximum 21 million limit: The total number of bitcoins that will be issued is capped at 21 million. The Bitcoin “mining” process presently creates 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes **(the number created will be halved every four years)**, so that limit will not be reached until the year 2140. A bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places, the number of fractional bitcoins (called “satoshis”) – at 21 x 1014 – will be more than enough for all conceivable applications
**After 2140, the bitcoin network miners will be incentivized with transaction fees just as the credit card networks are now**

Mt Box was shit for years and every sites including reddit people said so. People seen the high cost of bitcoin and still would send the BTC for cash and when they said they would stop all withdrawals, people sent the cash for cheap bitcoin. Even with warnings, people still gambled. 
So, I am going to send my bitcoin and/or cash to a business outside my country? Nope. 
I can tell you, if Mt. Box opened back up today, some fool would still use them. A fool and his money......

A controversial change was recently put into the next Bitcoin release that will effectively block any transaction with outputs less than 54.3 µBTC. The motivation behind this change was to discourage people from clogging up the blockchain with "uneconomic dust." You can read more and review the full implementation here.
We, at BitcoinGet, understand the importance of this change in ensuring the health and stability of the Bitcoin network. However, it will affect our operations to some degree. We will have to impose some threshold before pending balances get paid sometime in the near future. The threshold will be reasonably low—100 µBTC or so. **For a majority of our users, this shouldn't be an issue.**

Couldn't a bitcoin exchange start an online store selling small balls for $100.05 each and then send you the small $0.05 balls and put the rest ($100) into a bitcoin exchange? Then this Ball Store inc. also buy the balls back at $99.00 each. So your bank account would say Ball Store inc.

Please review this all for help;
**Don't like credit, use bitcoin.**
**Don't like using your ATM card on the internet, use bitcoin.**
You don't need to see volatility (never). You buy the bitcoins you need and send them to the merchant, you buy at the same time you purchase. You don't ever need to hold any bitcoins. Get your bitcoins from Coinbase. (You don't need to be a speculator to use bitcoin). Coinbase can help with this.
Yes, to purchase bitcoin instantly (one way to buy) you do need to add a Credit Card back-up but this is only to protect Coinbase and as long as you have money in your bank, Coinbase never will use the credit card.
*Other option is hold just a small amount to purchase with. Like 0.1 bitcoin = $55. Send your bitcoin to your Mycelium App on your phone as your wallet. Lose your phone, not an issue, this app lets you make a paper wallet back-up and is pin coded protected. Better them most bank phone App's
The merchant then sales the bitcoin back to cash. The merchant saves from credit card fee's and never see's any volatility of bitcoin eather.
The protocol of Bitcoin computer network is its backing like the dollar is the US gov. This network is larger then 600 government supper computers put together.
Don't speculate with bitcoin. Look up M-pesa.  Bitcoin / bitcoin will help 3rd world nations just like the M-Pesa has. 
Bernie Madoff didn't kill the Stock Market and Mt. Gox will not kill Bitcoin. 
Don't invest with bitcoin, it is not a get rick quick way of life but the protocol will help many people. ﻿

I have a fear that letting you lower the fee, we will see the same issue like we see with blockchain app not sending the transaction in a timely mater. Remember all the, my coin did not get sent so the merchant screen timed out or i had to pay in cash / credit card as the store never got my coin for over an hour.

You have to add a Visa backup
@_date: 2014-06-07 02:16:50
After using many spending bitcoin cell phone wallets, we started using the Mycelium Wallet as to its ease of use, you hold your own private keys, and you can make a paper wallet backup so if your phone becomes damaged or lost, you do not lose your bitcoins. 
This wallet also lets you import a paper wallet by selecting Cold Storage under the menu button. Mycelium states it will forward your bitcoin change back to the phone / paper wallet so you do not need to remove the full bitcoins from the paper wallet. We still do not recommend this unless you understand it but this is a very nice feature. We have recommended you never throw away an old paper wallet even if it is spent. 
As always, this is not an endorsement as you should review each wallet and make up your own mind but we would like to pass this review onto you. 
The Mycelium wallet as of today has never let us down. As long as you have data coverage, transactions always confirm. We recommend that you learn about the wallet and go into settings and Set a Pin Code. You should also Disable Local Trader in the settings if you are not going to use this feature. We do not use Local Trader at this time and cannot review it.
At this time of the writing this blog, Mycelium does not support new bitcoin address for every transaction or Multi-signature bitcoin addresses. Also, Mycelium by default, adds the 0.0001 or more depending on the transaction size

* [Coinbase](
* [Bitpay](
I like Bitpay as they are easier to set-up and use just on a [website checkout]( but if in the US, you will need a Coinbase or Circle.com account if you decide to hold bitcoin and cash out later but there are other options to sell your bitcoin.
If you want to just hold some bitcoin, Coinbase is also an online wallet but that could be a risk also. Bitpay will not hold any of your coin.
Both will cash you out of bitcoin with no volatility but their are also [other sites](

sorry is had the wrong figer on twitter worth.
but you are missing all the other opportunities Bitpay has to make money from trading, arbitrage, spread, and much, much more.
We all know an internet company like Twitter is much more popular and does have ad revenue but as you stated, they are still not profitable but Bitpay is an ecommerce company in sorts and Forax trading is trillions of dollars each day so why wouldn't Bitpay pass twitter in the long term as in value.

I can see this. With a credit card, they know it's you that ordered but with bitcoin (like cash) you may be trying to change someones order that was not you.
They can cancel the order and send you a gift card and if someone calls them, they can cancel the gift card or flag it if they find out you are trying to scam them.
It's not the best solution and I can see how they need to change it by using passwords or such and it must suck but I understand why they are doing this.
I see what they are doing here. 
Now, stop bitching and lets find a solution for them.

corrected in part, thanks. uploading new text now
Now, there are other payment processing companies that also help merchants start accepting bitcoins and other crytocoins but these companies do not directly change your bitcoins and other crytocoins into USD or charge a small fee. This takes a little more knowledge on the part of the merchant and involves setting up an account **in a payment processor, exchange, or wallet like Coinbase, BitPay, or Bitstamp**. Please educate yourself before using.


agreed but did you know by default, Coinbase has you keeping 10% in bitcoin even as they tell the merchants that they can convert 100% in fiat. I wonder how many do keep 10% and never change the settings 
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:58:35

Bartering is already taxed per past court ruling so yes, you pay a tax if you have a gain. 
You buy T-shirt at $10. You buy can of soda at $100. You pay that $90 in fiat as tax to government. That is why when people win a car on a game show that cost $20,000. They take the cash instead so they can pay the 20-35% or whatever in taxes. If they don't have the extra cash for the taxes they take the cash or sell the car to pay the owed taxes.

**What is Bitcoin...**
Bitcoin is a digital coin, ledger, currency, and digital innovation that exists almost wholly in the virtual realm. A growing number of proponents support its use as an alternative currency that can pay for goods and services much like conventional currencies. Bitcoin is the first and easily the most popular cryptocurrency, cryptocoin, or currency that uses cryptography to control its creation, administration, and security. Bitcoin with a capital “B” is considered the Public Ledger and bitcoin with a lower case “b” are considered the currency
Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown, mysterious individual or group with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is yet to be revealed and who left the project in 2010
* Bitcoin uses P2P technology without a central authority: Bitcoin is a decentralized currency managed by peer-to-peer technology (P2P), without a central authority. All functions such as Bitcoin issuance, transaction processing and verification are carried out collectively by the network, without a central supervisor or agency to oversee operations.
* Bitcoin is digital: Bitcoin has been designed to be a digital currency that prevents double spending.
* Bitcoin has a maximum 21 million limit: The total number of bitcoins that will be issued is capped at 21 million. The Bitcoin “mining” process presently creates 25 bitcoins approx.  every 10 minutes (the number created will be halved every four years), so that limit will not be reached until the year 2140. A bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places, the number of fractional bitcoins (called “satoshis”) – at 21 x 10^14 – will be more than enough for all conceivable applications.
* Bitcoin transactions have limitations: A bitcoin transaction can take as long as approx. 10 minutes to confirm. Transactions are also irreversible and can only be refunded by the bitcoin recipient. Zero (0) confirmations are ok for smaller purchase transactions but this depends on the recipient if they will take this risk not unlike with credit cards acceptance
* Bitcoin balances are not insured: This means that if you lose your bitcoins private keys for any reason – for example, your hard drive crashes, or a hacker steals from the digital wallet in which your bitcoins are stored, or the bitcoin exchange where you held a balance went out of business – you have little recourse but new companies are starting up everyday and one may work as an insure
* Bitcoin uses public key encryption techniques for security: This means that when a new bitcoin address is created, a cryptographic key pair consisting of a public key and private key – which are essentially unique, long strings of letters and numbers – is generated
* Bitcoin mining: Bitcoin mining is the terminology used to describe the world wide P2P network of computers that are used to verify the bitcoin transactions in the blockchain. At this time it is not recommended to mine with a computer (CPU) or video cards (GPU) as to the current difficulty. Currently bitcoin mining is done with Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips at a high cost. We recommend you do your research on bitcoin mining as you may not make your return on investment (ROI). It is also recommended you do not pre-pay for ACIS’s as some suppliers have not made promised delivery dates or have not ship at all. After 2140, the bitcoin network miners will be incentivized with transaction fees just as the credit card networks are now
All bitcoin transactions, without exception, are included in a shared public transaction log known as a “blockchain”. This is to confirm that the party spending the bitcoins really owns them, and also to prevent fraud and double-spending.
*Bitcoin has a number of advantages:*
* As the first cryptocoin to capture the public imagination, Bitcoin has “first mover” advantage and a  head start over the competition
* Total issuance is limited to 21 million, so it is unlikely to be devalued because of the prospect of a  massive influx of new bitcoins
* As a decentralized currency, Bitcoin is free from government interference and manipulation.
* Transaction costs are much lower than with conventional currencies.
*On the flip side, Bitcoin’s disadvantages include:*
* The price of a bitcoin has been volatile and increasing the risk of losses for investors in the  cryptocoins
* The relative anonymity of Bitcoin may encourage its use for illegal and illicit activities such as tax  evasion, illegal weapons procurement, gambling and circumvention of currency controls but less  likely then physical cash

I believe you should be an investor to use Bitcoin. At least a small one. Buy the amount of Bitcoin you may use in the future. Say $100.  You never buy more then $100. 
Now your ready ones you have the Bitcoin. Buy something for $30 in Bitcoin, recharge the$30 in Bitcoin and it gets you back to $100. 
It's like using a prepaid credit card. Always recharge what you use. Now you are always paying for items at market value and you now have an investment that may go up in value. Your prepaid credit card could not go up in value

*"Transaction fees are used as a protection against users sending transactions to overload the network."*
How much will the transaction fee be?
Most transactions can be processed without fees, but users are encouraged to pay a small voluntary fee for faster confirmation of their transactions and to remunerate miners. When fees are required, they generally don't exceed a few pennies in value. Your Bitcoin client will usually try to estimate an appropriate fee when required.
**Transaction fees are used as a protection against users sending transactions to overload the network.** The precise manner in which fees work is still being developed and will change over time. Because the fee is not related to the amount of bitcoins being sent, it may seem extremely low (0.0005 BTC for a 1,000 BTC transfer) or unfairly high (0.004 BTC for a 0.02 BTC payment). The fee is defined by attributes such as data in transaction and transaction recurrence. For example, if you are receiving a large number of tiny amounts, then fees for sending will be higher. Such payments are comparable to paying a restaurant bill using only pennies. Spending small fractions of your bitcoins rapidly may also require a fee. If your activity follows the pattern of conventional transactions, the fees should remain very low.

No Explanation Necessary
A Republican, in a wheelchair, entered a restaurant one afternoon and asked the waitress for a cup of coffee. The Republican looked across the restaurant and asked, "Is that Jesus sitting over there?" 
The waitress nodded "yes," so the Republican requested that she give Jesus a cup of coffee, on him. 
The next patron to come in was a Libertarian, with a hunched back. He shuffled over to a booth, painfully sat down, and asked the waitress for a cup of hot tea. He also glanced across the restaurant and asked, "Is that Jesus, over there?" 
The waitress nodded, so the Libertarian asked her to give Jesus a cup of hot tea, "My treat." 
The third patron to come into the restaurant was a Democrat on crutches. He hobbled over to a booth, sat down, and hollered, "Hey there honey! How about getting me a double espresso mocha latte?" He too looked across the restaurant and asked, "Isn't that Jesus over there?" 
The waitress nodded, so the Democrat directed her to give Jesus a latte too. "On my bill," he said loudly. 
As Jesus got up to leave, he passed by the Republican, touched him, and said, "For your kindness, you are healed." The Republican felt the strength come back into his legs, got up, and began to praise the Lord. 
Jesus passed by the Libertarian, touched him, and said, "For your kindness, you are healed." The Libertarian felt his back straightening up, and he raised his hands, and he began to praise the Lord. 
Then, Jesus walked towards the Democrat, just smiling. The Democrat jumped up and yelled, "Don't touch me ... I'm on disability."

On Nov. 15, 1999, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that DEN's co-founder, chairman and controlling shareholder, Marc Collins-Rector, co-founder and executive vice president Chad Shackley, and co-founder and executive vice president Pierce had resigned. The resignations followed a lawsuit settled by Collins-Rector in which it was alleged he had a sexual relationship with a minor for three years. Collins-Rector denied the allegations and the case was settled and dismissed. Neither Shackley nor Pierce were named in the suit.[13]

It's called day trading plus the exchange rate at bitpay is about $0.50 to $2.00 less then other echanges. I see a lot of ways for them to make money and if they use some if not all, I would invest in them. I still wonder when their IPO will come out. If twitter is worth $1.6 bill. and still have not made a profit, I can just imagine what Bitpay is worth today. If I was a VC, I would knocking at their door.

I know many that top-up once they use it and some of the early adopters are using bitcoin to buy stuff and not just cashing it in. Can you say if you purchased gold for $100 some years back and now it is over $1,300, you would not cash in some or use it to pay bill or buy stuff with today if we had a gold Coinbase or gold Bitpay today?

Treat it all like a cash transaction. The recipient can still say cash, the only issue is coinbase and bitpay put tips as percentages so you have to calculate by hand if the customer states he wants to give something like $5 tip on a $45.76 BILL. I have asked them to fix this.

bitcoin does not need a self appointed foundation. They try to help but they also have their own issues. Just think, do we have an "internet" foundation? NO 
Don't get me wrong, they do try to help but they are not elected by us so don't speak for me. I hope they can clean up their act and do a good job.

On Nov. 15, 1999, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that DEN's co-founder, chairman and controlling shareholder, Marc Collins-Rector, co-founder and executive vice president Chad Shackley, and co-founder and executive vice president Pierce had resigned. The resignations followed a lawsuit settled by Collins-Rector in which it was alleged he had a sexual relationship with a minor for three years. Collins-Rector denied the allegations and the case was settled and dismissed. Neither Shackley nor Pierce were named in the suit.[13]

* They can purchase a very low cost Android tablet.
Accept Bitcoin like you accept cash
**My Point of Sales system (POS) does not allow me to add bitcoin to it?**
At this time, not all POS systems are set-up for bitcoin. You can still accept bitcoin but you will need to use  your smart phone, tablet, or a website POS from Bitpay or DC POS. Just input the transaction into your POS like cash then have the customer uses one of the many web page POS’s or applications (Apps) on your phone or  tablet.

**What is Bitcoin...**
Bitcoin is a digital coin, ledger, currency, and digital innovation that exists almost wholly in the virtual realm. A growing number of proponents support its use as an alternative currency that can pay for goods and services much like conventional currencies. Bitcoin is the first and easily the most popular cryptocurrency, cryptocoin, or currency that uses cryptography to control its creation, administration, and security. Bitcoin with a capital “B” is considered the Public Ledger and bitcoin with a lower case “b” are considered the currency
Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown, mysterious individual or group with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is yet to be revealed and who left the project in 2010
* Bitcoin uses P2P technology without a central authority: Bitcoin is a decentralized currency managed by peer-to-peer technology (P2P), without a central authority. All functions such as Bitcoin issuance, transaction processing and verification are carried out collectively by the network, without a central supervisor or agency to oversee operations.
* Bitcoin is digital: Bitcoin has been designed to be a digital currency that prevents double spending.
* Bitcoin has a maximum 21 million limit: The total number of bitcoins that will be issued is capped at 21 million. The Bitcoin “mining” process presently creates 25 bitcoins approx. every 10 minutes (the number created will be halved every four years), so that limit will not be reached until the year 2140. A bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places, the number of fractional bitcoins (called “satoshis”) – at 21 x 10^14 – will be more than enough for all conceivable applications.
* Bitcoin transactions have limitations: A bitcoin transaction can take as long as approx. 10 minutes to confirm. Transactions are also irreversible and can only be refunded by the bitcoin recipient. Zero (0) confirmations are ok for smaller purchase transactions but this depends on the recipient if they will take this risk not unlike with credit cards acceptance
* Bitcoin balances are not insured: This means that if you lose your bitcoins private keys for any reason – for example, your hard drive crashes, or a hacker steals from the digital wallet in which your bitcoins are stored, or the bitcoin exchange where you held a balance went out of business – you have little recourse but new companies are starting up everyday and one may work as an insure
* Bitcoin uses public key encryption techniques for security: This means that when a new bitcoin address is created, a cryptographic key pair consisting of a public key and private key – which are essentially unique, long strings of letters and numbers – is generated
* Bitcoin mining: Bitcoin mining is the terminology used to describe the world wide P2P network of computers that are used to verify the bitcoin transactions in the blockchain. At this time it is not recommended to mine with a computer (CPU) or video cards (GPU) as to the current difficulty. Currently bitcoin mining is done with Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips at a high cost. We recommend you do your research on bitcoin mining as you may not make your return on investment (ROI). It is also recommended you do not pre-pay for ACIS’s as some suppliers have not made promised delivery dates or have not ship at all. After 2140, the bitcoin network miners will be incentivized with transaction fees just as the credit card networks are now
All bitcoin transactions, without exception, are included in a shared public transaction log known as a “blockchain”. This is to confirm that the party spending the bitcoins really owns them, and also to prevent fraud and double-spending.
*Bitcoin has a number of advantages:*
* As the first cryptocoin to capture the public imagination, Bitcoin has “first mover” advantage and a  head start over the competition
* Total issuance is limited to 21 million, so it is unlikely to be devalued because of the prospect of a  massive influx of new bitcoins
* As a decentralized currency, Bitcoin is free from government interference and manipulation.
* Transaction costs are much lower than with conventional currencies.
*On the flip side, Bitcoin’s disadvantages include:*
* The price of a bitcoin has been volatile and increasing the risk of losses for investors in the  cryptocoins
* The relative anonymity of Bitcoin may encourage its use for illegal and illicit activities such as tax  evasion, illegal weapons procurement, gambling and circumvention of currency controls but less  likely then physical cash
**How to use bitcoin as a consumer when purchasing to limit volatility**
Now you’re asking, why would I use bitcoin as a consumer as the bitcoin price fluctuates from what all merchants sell their merchandise or service for? As stated in part by this [Blog post]( using bitcoin as payment, you do not need to give the merchants your personal credit or debit card financial information so no risk of identity theft like what has happened with US companies of Target, Michael's, and PF Chang’s and you help avoid credit debt, and as bitcoin become more accepted throughout the world, you no longer need to exchange your currency to a foreign currency when traveling.
The best way to use bitcoin is sort of a like using a prepaid credit card or debit card as bitcoin is not controlled by any centralized bank or government, so you must also control purchase volatility. To do this, you must be a simple investor or holder of no more than the amount of bitcoin you may use as a consumer. This could be $20, $50, or $200. This amount can then be stored in a wallet on your phone or computer. When you use bitcoin, you just recharge or *buy back* (obtain) the amount of bitcoin you use at the time of each merchant purchase.
Say you now have $100 (USD) in bitcoin on your phone or computer wallet and you find something on the Internet for $20.25. This will bring you to about $79.75 in bitcoin after the purchase. Once you complete your purchase you will need to recharge or obtain back the approximate amount of bitcoin of $20.25 so you are now approximately back to $100 in bitcoin or at least the amount of bitcoin used. Say your purchase for $20.25 was 0.00215 bitcoin. You just recharge or obtain the 0.00215 bitcoin. I personally am also a very small investor of bitcoin and always recharge or obtain a little more bitcoin so I would have obtained .0022 bitcoin after the merchant purchase of the item(s).
This separates your investment form your currency. The $20.25 purchase was and always will be $20.25.
You may have been told the story of the person that purchased a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins. At the time, 10,000 bitcoins would have been about $20.00 or so. Most people now in July 2014, state this is a $6,000,000 (USD) pizza but if this person recharged or obtained 10,000 more bitcoins just after this purchase, they would have a $20.00 pizza and still have the 10,000 bitcoin investment they could cash in for $6,000,000 (USD) today (July 2014).
So using Bitcoin like this is like using a prepaid credit card but with the added advantage of future gains but you could lose your investment if the exchange rate of bitcoin goes down but you still have the benefit of a layer of financial identity protection.
Another point we must state is recharging or obtaining replacement bitcoins after each purchase may cost you more then the purchase price of the product by as low as $0.04 or maybe over $2.00 as to buy / sell spread from your exchange you use to obtain bitcoin from and miners fees but you save on the cost of purchasing identify theft protection and/or your own personal time fixing any financial identity issues. 
You may also need to adjust your holdings of bitcoin if the exchange rate of bitcoin drops or you start using bitcoin for larger and larger cost merchant purchases.

Remember Target and Michaels and eBay's identity theft. Some years back, I would tell people, don't buy from internet sites you don't trust as they could steal your credit info. Now when buying from websites with Bitcoin, I may only be out the merchadice not my full credit financial info. People say, well your protected. Not always. I have had $1000 never returned buy the bank using credit card for $20 at farmers market. After target, I had to miss a day of work to fix all cards. My wife used our card at a web site and then we would changed $1.50 for some service she didn't unchecked a box. That charge went on for 6 months before we could fit it to stop. No one paid us back.

But with gold, if you pay with gold you can not just buy it back at the same cost. If I pay with bitcoin, I re-buy bitcoin so the cost is the same just as overstock sells bitcoin for USD at the same time. I do belive if I buy with bitcoin I should get something for saving the merchant money. I also restock the bitcoins I buy with so I can hold for future.  You can go the other way but bitcoin the use it to pay with. Coinbase has instant buy so you also don't lose if the price goes down but once more, only if I get something in retern. e.g. discount,  gifts, points or ?

Coinbase has this listed on their site:
* Payment buttons allow you to accept bitcoin on your website.
* Great for personal payments, shopping cart integration, or donations.
* Users never need to leave your site - the payment flow happens in an embedded window.
* Prices can be shown in bitcoin or your local currency.
* Callbacks can be sent to your website when an order completes.
* Bitcoins can be automatically cashed out daily to any bank account.
* Allows first time users to purchase bitcoin if they don't own any.
* Create buttons dynamically via the Coinbase API.

Price will go back up as noods will not know or care in time. This is not the first for Mt Gox and will not be the last. 
I just with the media would use a different exchange to quote price. I have friends say, how do you feel loosing $300 a coin but forget most came in, at under $20. Still a gain. Their loss

GDAX is a trading platform / exchange owned by Coinbase. If you make Limit  buy and sells, there are no fee's but if you do market orders, there is still a fee. If you are just buying Bitcoin, buy on Coinbase as even if there is a fee, you may still make out as to price is going up but if price is going down, than yes, fee;s suck but the price going down will take more than the fee's anyways. 
If you add money into GDAX from your bank, you still have to wait like maybe 4 or more days and if price is going up, you may cost you more to buy if price is going up as you have to wait to buy when the money clears . 
Buy on Coinbase, you get the bitcoin at that price on the screen. may be $5 to $20 higher and with fee's but like I stated, the price over the next week may still make you in the red or black anyways.

Nothing new, people sold at $1,000 and wished they still had, others will sell at $8,000 and years from now, wish they still had. 
I had a chance to buy a car in the early 90's for $1,800 and now it's worth $100,000 so no regrets, we go on and pay our bill and buy cool stuff.
Life goes on.

Dear Coinbase customer,
There have been a number of developments with Bitcoin Segwit2x since our last update. No action is required and all funds stored on Coinbase remain safe. 
Last week, the Segwit2x development team announced they would no longer continue with the project. In addition, a significant portion of miners and other community leaders withdrew their support for the fork. However, despite these developments, a small number of miners may attempt to go forward with a fork.
We wanted to provide clarity about the potential outcomes of the fork and what Coinbase will do in each scenario.
To protect customer funds, Coinbase will disable Bitcoin sends and receives at 2 am Pacific Time on November 17th, and disable buys and sells an hour before the fork, which is currently predicted to occur between 6am to 8am Pacific Time on November 17th. All functionality will be re-enabled shortly afterwards.
Scenario 1: Network is unusable
If support for the fork remains at current levels or decreases, the Bitcoin2x network will be unusable. Coinbase will not support withdrawals or trading as it will not be possible to move these assets. Currently we believe this is the most likely scenario.
If the network gains support at a later date, we will enable Bitcoin2x withdrawals from the platform. 
Scenario 2: Network is usable
If transactions are being confirmed at a reasonable speed and miner support is strong, we will allow Coinbase customers to withdraw Bitcoin2x. We will not immediately enable buys and sells as previously stated, but we may enable them at a later date.
We will keep customers updated through our blog.
Thank you,
Coinbase Team
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:06:52
If you look back and not buy, you will feel like you missed out (feel sick) LOL
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:21:59
Just do it in the Coinbase app, works for GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:29:41
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:44:14
No issues here.  I will stay with them and now even use GDAX, part of Coinbase. 
If you understand their fees, how bitcoin works, and such, and how the US government works there will be no issues. Answer all questions trufuly and if you make big gains and cash out, pay your taxes
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:46:30
It's how they read the charts. maybe they think they are at the bottom? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:03:51

Try GDAX.  It's Coinbase exchange.  Money transfer the USD, in about 10 or so days. buy Bitcoin with limit buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:47:16
Move Bitcoin into an exchange,  trade for your money like USD. Than cash out as they allow if you want all BTC at today's price

maybe sign into your GDAX site (Coinbase owned), do a wire transfer and bypass their ignorance and take the $10,000 (or max limit a day for your wire, you can ask to up it) and do a market order. Youtube Limit orders if you like also to save some fee's and watch the chart for the best time to trade into Bitcoin or others. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:14:35
You need to read the white paper. :) 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:50:38
Price would crash as to supply and demand and then others would buy up the low cost coins as more hit the market, more the price would go done, and price would go back up sometime later. NEXT question 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:07:05
Has instant buy years ago with ACH bank transfers but they took it away, glad its coming back soon
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:27:16
All want to know the same :) small drop is coming but may be only $10
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:51:07
High volume I would guess. Give it some time or call tech support 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:12:29
because of that picture lol. If I was a criminal,  I would use monero
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:58:48
Amount of time between Bitcoin bubbles doubles every time so I think, when this one goes down, it will be about 4-5 years for the next and I predict it to hit 80,000 a BTC at that time. Buy less in the bubble and more outside the bubble. 
Every time you use to buy with, buy to replace it.   
If you need to cash out for a need, try to buy back in later. 
Set aside each paycheck and buy a little. 
Never look back. It will make you sick.
Best time to buy Bitcoin was 5 years ago, the next best time to buy Bitcoin is today. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:45:14
Cool, I was looking for this
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:07:19
I did a lot in 2014 but not many places I shop take them anymore. Maybe they will start back up soon with Bitcoin or others :) I wish more would just go to litecoin or maybe BCASH (see what I did there) when Coinbase and others add it. 
Why some say, it's cool and easy and I alway buy back what I use in crypto so my investment never goes down. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:39:45
Should I move my coins from GDAX to Coinbase?

@_date: 2017-11-22 23:28:40
not late as if there is a drop, you can sell instantly and buy back at the bottom. ;)

I am guessing they didn't pay to be listed?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:32:26
Yes, it takes some days for you money to clear the bank to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:20:16
One thing that makes me nervous is, yes, there are 21min coins but when I asked, all said this could be changed. Yes, I guess both could be but it seems like Bitcoin cash can easily be changed more so so any coin that does not have a set limit is more like cash and not an asset. (If I am wrong, please comment below. )
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:20:03
now it is
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:42:35
* 21 mil, set limit in the code 
* Value may go up or down just like today once all are mined. They will be traded as they are today.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:48:39

No credit card on GAX, and adding funds with bank account could take more than a week. You can do direct money wire transfers ($10 fee) that take about 1 day.
