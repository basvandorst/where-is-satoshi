You can pay a custom fee and set it pretty low.  Had a 120 sat. clear the other day when the wallet was suggesting 420.  Wait was about 8 hours - which wasn't fun, but wasn't bad when just moving money between personal wallets

Personally I had no cash or bitcoins at MtGox.  I'm simply looking for clues as to what will happen.
I believe a consultant company laid out this plan for MtGox. Mark Karpeles recently said in an interview that while the plan is not official, it's basically correct in what it says happened.

I hope it's good news.
From the way it was written, maybe a Wall Street firm or some big investors asked them to stop trading so they could implement something bigger and more official.  Maybe make it a US exchange only available to accredited investors.  Like Tradehill tried to do, and make themselves only available to people with a $100k or more.
I'm sure people on Wall Street would like to figure out a way to corner the market of bitcoins.

To send money to the US, have your mom setup a checking account if she doesn't have one already.  Then have her setup, or setup an account for her on Coinbase.com.  Link that to her checking account.
Buy your bitcoins from somewhere in Turkey, localbitcoins.com is fine.  Send the bitcoins to her coinbase.com account.  Then sell the bitcoins to coinbase.com and then transfer the money from there to her checking account.
You'll pay some fees this way but it should be cheaper than WU.

Speeding up the process of fiat deposits isn't what people are concerned about with Mt Gox. Fiat withdraws, especially those outside Japan are the main concern.  Unless they can address that, no one outside Japan should care to have any business to do with them. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:28:36
Sorry that link was the estimated financials. The PowerPoint slide is at:
The document lays out a plan to repay MtGox accounts by limiting withdrawls, injecting the business with cash and bitcoins, and then slowly revive the business as Gox and pay accounts out. Looks like it will take a couple years to do this.
edit: a word
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:59:33
Is there any way in the case to get Gox to prove the funds are actually missing? Seems like there's a lot of uncertainty about that even being true.

Part of the reason is because bitcoin is under attack from spam transactions.  Most likely from people who want bitcoin to fail. Whether that's holders or other coins, the state, or some private business interests I don't know.
While I appreciate what core has done increasing the block size seems a little prudent.  If full nodes couldn't run on raspberry pi's anymore but could run on used laptops I think good decentralization could still exist.  A bit larger size would make attacks filling up whole blocks more expensive at the least and allow room for growth.

It's good for small amounts, it is one of the largest wallet providers used.  It's also good to keep an eye on offline balances.  But would recommend keeping the majority offline (in something like trezor or paper wallets).

I would create a bitaddress paper wallet and then send the coin to the new address using whatever bitcoin wallet you currently have and use Electron Cash to send the bch coin to the same address. The private key for the new address will control both the btc coin and the bch coin. This way you hold your own private key.

Get an account on blockchain.info.  It's a good trade off between usability &amp; security.  This gives you a good online wallet that you can use on your iPhone/Android.
Then get a bitcoin buyer to send you coins for a monthly payment you make to them.  Heck, if you want I'll sell you coins monthly.
(Or sign up for an exchange, connect to your bank account and transfer a small sum each month, buy at the current rate and send to your blockchain.info wallet.)

Here's what I would say is the easiest and best for you with cheapness in mind. Get a friend to setup a Dwolla account and Mt Gox account, it's free and then they can buy bitcoins for you - keeping your name out of any official transactions.  Buy them some beer or give them $30 for doing it.

Thanks for the tip!  Ran into a Segwit address problem though, maybe someone here can help me.
I used  to create an address (3DnW8JGpPViEZdpqat8qky1zc26EKbXnmM) and corresponding key.  I sent some bitcoin from a non-segwit address to the new address.  However, the segwit key doesn't seem to work with the new segwit address.  And the funds seem to have been transferred just a few minutes later to a different segwit address(39UmBVTjsJUyreLxd8JNK3DEa485F2qSfB).
What happened? How can I spend my bitcoin with the private key from the  website?
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:39:20
You have to go into settings, addresses, and export the private key from the old address out. Then import it into  bcc wallet.
If it doesn’t show a balance, you may have to covert that old key using bitaddress.  There is a bug in blockchain website that complicates the exporting of private keys sometimes.  I posted about the bug awhile back.  
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:08:50
I had the same thing happen.  Used segwitaddress.org, sent some bitcoin to a segwit address and then couldn't spend it.  :(
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:36:44
I'd be worried, but I don't see that happening.  Its useful and has value, if someone doesn't see that then they really don't understand it. 
There's no other way to hold value that can't be taken from you as long as you securely hold your private keys. There's no other way to travel round the world without any worry that a border guard will confiscate what money you carry.  There's no other way to pay anyone else, anywhere, without any one else's permission to setup an account or use their payment network.

Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, if the wife has an inheritance put it in an index fund or gold or whatever.  Could buy bitcoin too, as long as you don’t buy so much your combined portfolio is out of wack.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:12:31
Well, it might take some technical skills to do it.
The instructions here:  
work just fine.  Once you separate your BTC from BCC, you can send the BCC from Electron to an exchange of your choice that handles BCC.  (like Bittrex, or Bitfinex, etc.)
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:09:57

I agree with you. The banks will make a successful version of the blockchain that is private and serves their own purposes.  Bitcoin will still exist, but it will be the general clearing house of the public, to the banks private one between banks. Both can and will co-exist.
It's not in the banks interest to pump money in to Bitcoin when it could be a threat and the software is open to inspection and modification already.

My Amex doesn't have a yearly fee. (Everyday blue cash) 
And I  have successfully used both the chargeback feature and purchase protection on my credit cards. Recently my kid kicked over our brand new TV and we were reimbursed fully, so I know it's not a scam.
Only issue is you have to know how to document and present your side of the story to take advantage of the benefits. Which I guess I know how to do.
Bitcoin is awesome. But there are going to be benefits it doesn't offer. Like buying on credit, rewards programs, and consumer protection mechanisms.

I like Bitcoin.   Hope it takes off more. 
But from a consumer perspective, Amex gives great rewards (cash back) and card benefits like purchase protection (against accidental damage/theft 90 days), and they can/will do chargebacks if a business is shady.

I understand that we're paying inflated prices to cover merchant costs, you are absolutely right there.
But until merchants give us either a cash or Bitcoin discount over paying with credit cards, using a rewards card and paying off the balance will put more money in your pocket. It will also give you those other benefits. 
The merchants really need to offer cash/Bitcoin discounts so there is an incentive not to put it on a card.

Shouldn't use BoA, they're about the shittiest bank there is.  
If you wire sufficiently large enough sums ($2,000 +), an international transfer becomes affordable and you can buy straight from Mt. Gox.  Or you can use whatever people recommend for a US exchange.  If you don't want it connected with you, buy from someone local with localbitcoins and a high feedback rating.

This is a good way to fund your bitcoin exchange account, the only problem I've found with it is that Bitfloor's customer service stinks if you run into any issues that need resolution. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 07:42:46
I see, well the website isn't down but if you can't transfer money from NZ to Mt Gox, then the Mt Gox website isn't much use to a kiwi.  I apologize for the title, I wish I could change it and make it more specific.

I was thinking for the Olivine package, which is 23.90 euro or 31.88 usd if paid yearly. Then if that's 50% off that for bitcoin, then 31.88/2= 15.94/12= $1.33 /month

I can probably help get you a bitcoin if you want, just PM me. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:37:01
Search the app store for Coinjar.  I use it as a bitcoin wallet with no problem. And I don't need to jailbreak to use it.
@_date: 2013-02-07 11:15:26
This was pretty funny
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:19:26
Good luck man. I have a Roth IRA through sharebuilder. I put the money into a trading account with them and just bought google stock with it.  So far it's done really well. But you could buy DIA if you want to be safer, which is an index fund that follows the Dow Jones Index. Lots of options for you. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 20:28:56
I'd be excited by this, all my interactions with these guys were positive. Plus more markets and competition for mtgox is a good thing. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 09:12:02
I can sell to you in NZ. :)
Let me know you came from Reddit.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:05:38
Ya, it's kind of weird. It's nothing to setup a bitcoin account and there's good reasons to do so. But not lots of interest yet in many circles
@_date: 2013-08-22 11:30:56
In the photo it shows coin   Maybe that one.  :)
@_date: 2013-12-28 09:32:29
Guess someone in India's finance arm of the government wasn't paid off.  It seems to me that all these governments want their own stake in bitcoin, but that they simply take it rather than buying or earning it.
@_date: 2013-07-22 07:21:23
I'd like one of these that has a QR code printer built in.  This way I wouldn't have to bring a code, one could be generated on the fly.  Also would be nice if the bill acceptor took NZ currency.
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:56:18
Just send bitcoin to that address to increase your balance. 
Then use the same syntax that you see other people using in the comments section on Reddit posts.

This place sells an oz of Michael Jackson gold for 0.10 btc? I guess I'm a little confused by this site.
At first I thought this was similar to Casascius coins but I guess they're more ornamental rather than a store of value. 
@_date: 2013-09-01 08:55:43
Cool. Moving to the US next year and was wondering how I might sell them without easy to use bank to bank transfers. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 09:16:25
Good show!  This makes me want to buy coins from you.  :)
Edit: Just put my order through, thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:46:25
Thanks for trying this guys.  As I mentioned in a post further down, this didn't work on my work laptop.  But it just worked on my home laptop.
I was using blockchain.info to import the wallet address earlier and it wouldn't do it.  It simply gave me an error message.  I didn't write down the error message though.  If it happens again I'll make sure to write that down.
I'm thinking maybe this happened because of work's network security permissions.  Strange.
Edit:  Added detail
@_date: 2013-06-13 10:28:58
who needs an invite to use Bitinstant?  
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:19:54
Yep, that's the one.
@_date: 2013-06-24 06:56:03
Um, if I sent money to another exchange, my title would still be correct.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:32:30
I loaded the wallet, but when I tried to retrieve the bitcoin the QR wouldn't work, so I had to type the private key in by hand. I used bitaddress to create the wallet, anybody else have this issue?
Reason I'm asking is because it scares me slightly to commit larger sums of bitcoin to bitaddress generated wallets if I then can't retrieve the funds. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:04:50
This was a good story, with a pretty cool detective chasing the stolen coins. I love his technique. Hopefully this guy Tomas gets caught. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:49:42
You can sell on localbitcoins, but you need a few coins to float in between coinbase and your buyer. Yes you're taking a currency risk, but that's what the other sellers on localbitcoins are doing too. Which is why they charge a premium. 
@_date: 2013-09-09 10:39:01
The Dr. Evil bills are pretty sweet.
@_date: 2013-08-28 09:56:02
That comes out to just over a dollar a month.  Pretty good.

There would be a very strong incentive for insider trading for sure. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 11:14:03
So... if this is legit and legal, why run this on Tor?  Why not run a normal website but fund with bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:52:55
People keep saying there's going to be a crash, but consider this.  Bitcoin is a new technology and one of the latest best investments.  It had a large list of features that make it better for storing and transferring value above and beyond fiat.  You can bet your ass that there are more people wanting to get into bitcoin now than ever.  And that probably the people coming in want to buy more bitcoin than is actually available.
This is why I started to sell, but ultimately decided not to.  If you can survive any temporary sell offs, you've bought into what is possibly one of the biggest IPOs in recent times.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:51:54
I bought Casascius Silver Bitcoins, so I guess I bought both at once.  :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:09:28
Might be interested in this too. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 20:23:54
This is very cool. I'm already a namecheap customer and knowing you guys are bitcoin supporters make me even happier. You customer service rocks btw. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:21:48
Well the safest I can think of is if you download the official source code for the bitcoin client, compile that yourself, and then generate a new wallet offline - I would presume you have the best chance of ensuring a clean generation that way.  You have to trust the source code there is real but there has to be some level of trust unless you want to code completely from scratch. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 07:13:57
They're closed right now, but I sent them an email and will see what they reply tomorrow.

Take a ferry over to the Asian side. I think we went to Kadikoy when we were there just to see how locals lived off the tourist path

I wish I had done this last year, but I was afraid kids wouldn't be excited for an investment gift.  That gift would be over $1000 now.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:59:44
I had this happen too, I'm in NZ.  Sucks. 
@_date: 2013-09-01 03:07:49
Ok, I have them on order. I'll let you all know when the arrive. I'll be putting them in airtite coin capsules for protection before shipping.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:23:57
I think it's a really good possibility.  Maybe not to cash out through GOx.  But just to mix their coins. 
@_date: 2013-02-05 10:30:53
I'm a little confused. Does it really require 30 btc to open an account on mpex.co?  And then you have to put another 10 btc in to start trading?
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:12:08
Try coinjar
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:58:58
Would all this extra cash in Bitstamp make it more volatile in the future?
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:27:14
Is this the only available open source exchange code base, or are there others? I have friends interested in setting up another exchange if the open source is available. 
@_date: 2013-09-01 08:04:12
When selling on localbitcoins.com, do you meet for cash only or are there cheap or free way to do bank payments to each other in the US? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:50:05
As a localbitcoins seller , the bank can and has processed reversals for bitcoin related transfers. Sorry man, you'll have to walk yourself to the bank.

If you don't have any income as a student and are still a dependent on your parents taxes, you can safely take out up to $5700 without filing and paying taxes yourself.  Putting $5500 in a Roth IRA is a great idea and you should max it out every year you can.

What's amusing is that everyone wanted to abandon Mt Gox, which brought its trading volume way down. But then that also made it easier to manipulate the price on there - and now people complain about that. For better or worse, Mt Gox is still the standard when people ask 'how much is a bitcoin worth?' 
@_date: 2013-03-24 05:37:12
I'm a little confused about how another trade hill is specifically b2b. If it's an exchange, it seems like the same thing. I'm happy to see them back up and running though - I had positive experiences with them last time. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:35:06
Ha ha.  No it's cool, this one is empty now. I only posted it after I got it to work manually. But the QR code is fubar for some reason.
