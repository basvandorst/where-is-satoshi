Not really true: nodes have the freedom to implement whatever policy they want on how keep UTXOs. The bitcoin protocol does not enforce that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:07:14
Pretty sure they donated in the past. You just don't donate 5000+ BTC if you are not already used to the idea of giving back some of your luck.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:59:25
why? Borrow 15000USD. Buy 1 bitcoin. Declare yourself broke. Nobody will be able to take back your 1BTC anyway :)
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:01:43
Hi, thank you for the interesting post.
I have some questions though because I am not unsure I understood the main point of your considerations.
It is true that it might be possible to identify a node owner with a real person (with some effort: IP, channels used, etc) as you said. So let us just assume I declare to the world my Name, Surname and IP address of my LN node.
With these infos they will be able to see:
1) How much money I had at some point (initial state of my channels)
2) My channel-peers can see when I make a transaction and how much I am sending way and how much I receive.
However, if I understand correctly the onion-system: **nobody can see who is ultimately receiving my payments**.
Is that correct? Of course there are situations where some correlation can disclose some info. 
For example: users A, B have only 1 channel with user C.
A sends 0.13416134 BTC to B using the channel C.
Of course C will be able to infer, given the unique amount being sent, that the final recipient was C. But with enough decentralization and with some basic ideas (e.g., sending less 'unique' amounts of money) the privacy should be much stronger.
What do you think? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:00:02
Layer2 is quite better than Bitcoin in terms of privacy.
Anyway, of course if you need serious privacy:
1) buy Monero or other coins of this type.
2) convert to BTC (this will be 'clean' btc not linkable to you)
3) open a channel with somebody not requiring identification 
4) fund your TOR exit nodes

I like very much Lykke Exchange.
Unlike all other exchanges, it is based on multisig. This means that when you deposit your BTC you keep control over them! The multisig prevents them from stealing or losing your coins.
They call it semi-decentralized because, while you keep the coins, they run the bid/ask algorithms to match offers much more quickly than any fully decentralized exchange.
Interesting project (DISCLAIMER: I have invested in it)

You have not read what neonzzzzz told you.
In Europe you don't need any pin or any signature to make contact-less payments (usually limited to 30 EUROs). So yeah, if you lose your CC and somebody finds it, it can go in a shop (for example food shop) and buy stuff for 30 euros without signing or entering any pins.

Am I correct saying, then, that starting now a small mining operations (similar to yours) is - economically - extremely difficult ?
With $1100/month it would take a long time to repay for the initial investment (hardware: the many miners you have, the power supplies, etc).
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:36:15

Interesting: could you be more precise?
At current difficulty and price (and assume they stay constant for 30 days) how much profit you make at the end of the month (only considering electricity costs, no hardware costs, which you already covered). 
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:08:48
I suggest you only trust direct sources: like him talking directly at some conference/event.
He's bullish bitcoin, and skeptical/neutral to "blockchain".
What I've heard from him (directly, not via a crappy journalist reporting his words) is that bitcoin has about 20% chances of becoming the new gold, and 80% chances of failing... And that, taking these probabilities into account, He is bullish on bitcoin.
This means that he's not pretending to be a oracle.
If bitcoin fails (80%) then he loses some money (say N millions usd). If bitcoin becomes a replacement for gold (20%) then he gets N*K millions, for some number K he has in mind. And that he likes this bet because the factor K is big.
@_date: 2018-05-29 07:27:26
Could you please expand on this?
I mean: suppose some big company want to create a state of the art mining operation TODAY (not June 2017).
At the current price (btc=7000usd) is this profitable? I mean, how long will it take for the company to pay back all the investments (assuming btc remains stable at 3cent/kwh and current prices of S9 and liquid cooling)

Fortunately the limit from physics, not far away from 7nm, will put a bound on how much ASICs can improve in the next decade. 
This means that soon enough, thanks to competition, we will have cheap ASICs and more distribution across the world. People will use their solar panel to ecologically power the miners and heat their home at the same time.

Hi Claymore, not sure. Andreas has commented on this:
Eventually mining rigs will reach a limit (5 nanometers?) of efficiency, and we are not far away (7nm coming this year). At some point it will be all about price of electricity (and ok, infrastructure like cooling systems). And this will be a race played worldwide and not centralised.
@_date: 2018-05-11 18:35:24
Good comment.
@_date: 2018-05-29 07:23:41


this means that miners do not last ages... After 24-36months you will probably be forced to replace some of your equipment. 
You seem to assume in your calculations that the companies who invested millions in infrastructure have already covered ALL the costs of their infrastructure.
If this is true... well... good for them indeed! It really means that BTC was way overpriced :)
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:27:52
Is it different with gold? Or USD? Or ... anything valuable?
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:50:41
Not sure if you are trolling or not.
Buying 3000 BTC means buy about 0.02% of all existing bitcoins. 
There is about 170.000 tonnes of gold in the world. So 0.02% of that is a bit more than 20 tonnes of gold.
Try buying that amount in one shot without altering gold's price :)

Bitmain has surely the first-mover-advantage, kudos to them for being pioneers in this space! But other players (e.g., Samsung) will enter in the game soon enough.
Let's see how it plays out... But it seems to me that, yes, we currently face centralisation problems, but those will be tend to reduce rather than grow in the medium (2-3) long term (8-10 years)
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:25:13
Reality is that mining profitability is at the moment at the bottom. This might mean that NOW the price of bitcoin is somewhat reasonable/good. 
For the vast majority of people, it is more profitable to buy bitcoin than to mine. This was NOT the case in December, where mining profitability was 6x current levels and you could repay your S9 in 2-3 months 
@_date: 2018-08-23 09:07:38

you are right. And it is probably better this way. Anyway, applications of LN like this could have good impact elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-10-14 09:47:41
To understand better: what do the numbers in the website represent exactly?
For example, bitcoin now has 'price $ 6309.15 and 'buy support $ 5,420,432'. Does it mean that somebody could sell 5,4mUSD worth of bitcoin  and that the market would support this level (i.e., take this sell offer?)
Remark: you write "Top 50 cryptocurrencies buy support/sell resistance within 10% price range." but you show 99 currencies.

Perhaps a decent option is to buy ETH and convert it to DAI on a DEX.
At least it's decentralised and pegged to the USD, so you should not experience anymore the issues of centralisation.

@_date: 2019-01-25 11:39:08
Ok, but how having bitcoin 'take over' would solve the problem of "no incentive to buy because your money would be worth more in the future"?
It's clear, even today, that people prefer to hodl bitcoin rather than spending because they assume it will increase in price over time. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 12:39:18
fortunately not, but I like the MakerDao project.
Just to follow you, are you saying Ethereum is centralised and 99.9% of nodes are run on AWS?
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:03:45
True, however the risk is much much MUCH higher:
if a group of top BTC pools (having &gt;50% hashpower) acts like this, they will disappear from the mining competition (for, say, 50 blocks, as in the youtube video). This will make the BTC-network hashrate go down by 50% and this will be surely noticed! 
This means that before making huge value transfer (70mUSD or so) will become harder because exchanges/services will be quite suspicious. 
In other words, the risk that this will not work in favour of the group of pools is very high and failure will be extremely costly. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:21:08
Ah too bad! Anyway, keep up the interesting work! :)

I agree with you but I indeed would like so more scientific study. What is the *REAL* price for mining bitcoin in each country (by, say, a medium sized company whose goal is to profit 1m USD / year after all costs?)

@_date: 2018-02-06 11:07:05
It seems like now (at least from the graph) it is as profitable as in March 2017. Which sounds healthy because at the time Bitcoin was not yet in a "bubble" (I am not saying that it is right now, I personally think the real bubble has yet to come, but my opinion is irrelevant).
So, is this line of reasoning correct?
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:06:39

Not really! 
The BTC power needed to dominate BCH-mining is (as explained in the video) below 10%. A 10% drop in the BTC hashrate would not necessarily trigger the same level of suspicion as a 50% drop would.

So the idea is to buy 5BTC and sell one bitcoin future (which has a value of 5btc at CME if I am not mistaken).
Total cost of the operation is more or less equal to K usd, where K =(current price of BTC)*(5+5)
In one month time you are basically guaranteed to still have a total worth of K usd. 
Is this correct?

Multi-signature wallets, two signatures:

Man relax :) I agree with you but these posts are funny, what's the problem?
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:44:39
Thanks this was unclear to me.
So basically, today pension funds (for example) cannot invest in BTC but can invest into derivatives shit or other risky assets. If an ETF is approved, they will be able to invest in BTC too.

Lol, why is this guy still making predictions? 
He must have a lot of BTC in his bag..

search for Marc de Mesel!

maybe you are right (i kind of agree with you) but the refugees that already left their home need some help, now. This looks (!) like a good project
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:20:45
interesting. So you think it is still profitable for them (not just to keep up existing infrastructure but even to start new ones) at these prices?
@_date: 2018-07-21 10:03:31
you are assuming that keeping your bitcoins safe costs zero.
This might be true for you, single person (just print a paper wallet and hide it very well).
But if you have 50m USD in bitcoin, not yours but of your 5000 customers, things become more complicated. You need some insurance, you need some company to deal with that, or at least you have to pay some specialists in your company, etc.
This costs money

Cheers man, tip me please :)

probably both are responsible.

I got it! Ahaha sorry, didn't mean to be stingy.
But I don't get it. Why not allow tips of 1 sat? O_o
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:03:23
for example. But ok, no, you are a bit too young to meet random people in the street. So I suggest you indeed use your father's account. 
But then leave the centralised exchanges and keep the coins in your hardware wallet :)
good luck and have fun!

yeah, 20000 is expected in due time... that's why the price is 5000. LoL
@_date: 2018-12-30 16:49:33
so you HODL but you sell on LocalBitcoin? O_o
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:19:35
that's not the most instructive way to start!
You can easily find 200euros worth of bitcoins in "the street" :)
Act as if you were a secret agent, and avoid big exchanges! :D

True, I didn't think about fees because the bot, really, is a private ledger. But it's true that when you collect your sats, they need to pay some fees to send them to you.

some people prefer to live together with other happy and relatively similar in wealth people. :) Living like a king must be boring after a while.

@_date: 2018-12-10 21:24:42
dude how does one starts with this lntips?
Could you tip me 1 satoshi already or I need to register somewhere, somehow?
@_date: 2018-12-03 07:36:15
I don't have a twitter account! How can I register?
Why do you ask for registration anyway?

@_date: 2018-12-29 21:08:34
that's the attitude.
You have learnt a great deal and you are only 16. 
Keep learning and things will be ok for you.
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:21:55
"almost". In reality we will LOL a bit.
