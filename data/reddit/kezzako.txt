ETH was at 80% of BTC's market cap in mid-june 2017, so it came pretty close. Definitely possible

Lol? How is Ethereum centralized?

The ice age will drastically reduce the profitability of mining ETH to force the miners to accept POS

What are you talking about? No one promised fast solutions. Vitalik has always been saying POS is gonna take years and that sharding will happen a few years later. At least we know it's going to be solved

Yeah, there is no solution right now, but the roadmap is clear and feasible. POS is expected to come in 2018 and sharding later. But Ethereum currently has a much better tx/s capacity at 14tx/s compared to 2.5-3tx/s for bitcoin. [Source for 14tx/s.]( /draft_of_ethereum_section_needs_technical_fact/diiwm8j/) Also, Ethereum has a dynamic block size that increases automatically when blocks are near-full but the reason there was a small backlog this week is because some miners (33-50% of miners) are voting for a small block. [Source]( and because of the crazy BAT ICO. I personally expect the blocks will increase as the remaining pools vote on the correct block size. Ethereum still got a long way to go, but it's getting there!
