Bullshit.

Man, you say that, but a yard, 2 car garage and enough space to raise a family sounds like some pretty swell shackles. What home loans are the libertarians/cryptoanarchists offering?
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:50:00
This is the correct answer.

Thiel is clearly lawful evil. Satoshi is lawful neutral. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:17:10
He definitely is.   and there's plenty more but I'm taking a shit and this is the absolute extent of any effort I'm going to put into this thread. IDGAF what you think.

This sub had been circling the meme toilet bowl for years. There's just about zero quality substance here, just circle jerking and hodl screamers. I miss from '12

He's not, really, though. He's pretty damn smart and was lucky enough to be in the right place in the right time, but he's an asshole, a criminal (and not the good kind like you want) and possibly a killer. And he's been so fucked out of his gourd that he hasn't been relevant in a decade.

Lol.

Great idea, but there seems to be some privacy implications with how it's currently built. Unless there's some kind of obfuscation, you might not want to let people search for exact addresses of folks taking bitcoin/eth?
Example: Search my zipcode to see what rooms are available, see three pinpointed addresses around my neighborhood. Wouldn't it be better to have generalized locations, like in Airbnb?

No. You don't "know" the adoption rate will grow to hundreds of millions. You're opining. Spouting bullshit. I think it *could* grow to that, but it could come crashing down too. Both are absolutely a possibility and if you don't recognize that... Well then I suppose we have nothing to talk about.

I disagree. Miners getting paid a predictable amount makes a healthier network. Miners getting paid more makes happier miners, though. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:00:19
No. No no no no no. Bitcoin is a currency and a protocol that survives because of the hard work and ingenuity of the developers and the service it provides. Asking folks to mine on old ASICs at a loss to prop up the currency is doing it - and all of us that rely on it - a huge disservice. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:58:01
This is the only correct answer.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:58:43
It doesn't sound religious at all. We're talking about economics here. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:03:20
As an 'old guy' on this sub, having been on and off since 2011, this thread is fucking depressing. If you are asking people to mine at a loss, you're acting more like we're participating in a ponzi then a revolutionary cryptocurrency. Bitcoin survives or fails on its merits and resilience, on the service it provides. Anything else is just FUD.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:09:17


Sorry, they do. They always have. The mining process is inextricably linked to Bitcoin, it's the secret sauce. The miners generate new coins and confirm transactions, literally the added value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's defenders are the evangelizers, but those evangelizers come across as crackpots and scam artists when they push ridiculous arguments like those in this thread and OP. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:16:53
:-/ Or the market is behaving irrationally in a rush up to 10K. Honestly you don't know, and no one here does.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:31:48
I don't believe you. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:51:06
You dumb.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:18:06
Great. This guy is *exactly* who we want as the face of bitcoin... /s
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:49:18
Who gives a shit. "Accepting Bitcoin" isn't difficult. It's not even novel, now. It's 2018. You're trying to get some free advertising by milking folks shell shocked from the crash who will upvote anything remotely positive. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:06:01
Don't be an idiot. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose. How is that still something that needs to be told to people? 
If you want some reassurances: nothing fundamentally has changed for btc. Ponzi alts are finally collapsing, the general public thinks all cryptocurrencies are the same so BTC is sliding, but BTC still *works* just as well as it did at 20K. And the supply/demand problem is just as serious. Unless you think bitcoin is dead, this is a dip.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:35:50
No, you can, because he's a conman. There are plenty of folks here on this sub that were "there from the very beginning" - CSW is a fraud, a liar, a con artist. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:25:06
Your opinion is garbage conspiracy wingnut bullshit. BCH blows, but to anyone that was in the Bitcoin world in 2011, that was THE killer feature. I remember multiple Bitcoin meetups where we passed multiple thousands of dollars all around the room for free. More than anything else that's what perked up ears.

@_date: 2018-02-12 16:47:06
This type of navel-gazing prognosticating is utter bullshit and terrible for this community and subreddit in particular.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:06:59
So it's a scam? Gotcha, thought so as well.
