The point is to make revolution ... we should support each other and fight the corrupt system of the fiat that taxing us until we die!  Who gives f ... whether it's bitcoin or ether or monero cardano or even ripple ... cryptocurrencies are our last chance!  If we don't make it, then we are all really f .... forever !!!!!
  Support each other, innovate and share the knowledge that bitcoin have given us !!!!  So we can create a better world without all these stupid wars and killing innocent people !!!

Agree...big ego he has
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:06:02
I agree with that...I think BTC is the best...but I also respect all the good projects and people that try to make good for the crypto world..arrogant people like Tone Vays...are destroying the crypto space... I think maximalism is stupid..and very limited and remind me fiat guys:)

When you have a shop by Facebook you can request a payment...this showed just once and then not again...is it mistake? Is the B maybe bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:17:57
And you are the biggest ignorant from them all:)
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:28:29
No dude, I don’t have a channel with crypto videos:))...but I like positivity...all people that promote crypto, and I think all the haters don’t do any good for this space...
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:29:40
Yes I also don’t like Facebook, but if Facebook will accept BTC then BTC will skyrocket...
