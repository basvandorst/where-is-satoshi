Not completely sure but just know it takes like a week for a deposit to actually hit your account.  Kind of ridiculous.  If you do a bank wire it's faster but your bank will hit you with a $10 fee or something.

Is it not the market price of the coin times the number of coins?
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:54:28
I'm with you.  "Store of value" doesn't make a ton of sense when you realize most people are just trying to make money of bitcoin.

There's always money in the bananacoin...

You can deposit USD directly into GDAX to save you a step

I don't think you understand how markets work... there's a reason why most coins have much smaller market caps despite having 100M+ coins.  In your scenario the market cap would plummet if people didn't actually want the coin.  The market cap is a proxy for aggregate demand or a type of currency.

Doesn’t really help people who bought in December lol

Awesome segment, enough detail without being too complex.  Gonna be a wild 21 days everyone!

Doesn’t bother you how quickly and quietly it was pulled off? Seems like a truly decentralized system would have more difficulty with the fix.

What are we doing here guys

Agreed, she's a solid journalist that challenges guests when they come on the pod.

Is there really no fee? They have to make money somehow right

It’s basically like predicting if more people in a crowd will turn left or right. You could make an educated guess, but it’s hard to really predict what people are going to do.

Sorry, meant are they out of the money: ie the strike price is below the stock price. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:57:07
I actually get more annoyed by people who obsess over the price going up
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:42:58
In a month or two?? What are we supposed to obsess about in the meantime?
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:26:02

Can we be honest here... the only reason 99% buy bitcoin is to make money from the price.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:52:14
You are clearly not financially literate. If you could predict future returns with past results ordinary people could get fabulously wealthy from the stock market. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:22:18
So.... why is everyone so terrified of legislation then?
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:58:47
So are most people’s options worthless now? I seem to recall their last private valuation being around $10B
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:45:46
You can short bitcoin on kraken pretty easily
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:54:37
True but the market cap is so much higher it means significant more volume
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:58:52
Probably 53% if you take into account fees
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:42:05
Yeah confused why no one considers this an option
@_date: 2018-04-10 04:02:13
also helps time your buys and sells better
