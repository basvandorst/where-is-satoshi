Haha I know. It's supposed to be almost impossible. That was the point I was getting to.

Read up on wallets and private keys and learn how to manage/secure your own keys. I suggest doing that before buying any coins.

If you interested 100 at today's price of 573, you have about .174 coins. I'd the price rises 200 tomorrow to 773, you still have .174 coin. If you sell it at the new price , you will have 134 dollars. Making a total of $34 profit

I think electrum uses a 13 word phrase. Not 100% sure but I believe that's the case

And if you just want to mess around, I don't suggest mining as an individual. Just purchase them after learning about how to secure your private keys

If you leave money on the coin base wallet, its bad because it can get hacked. Their vault should be better if it does have the 2factor authentication. 
However, once you get more into Bitcoin and experienced with the technology, I'd suggest me moving your coins from the vault and into a wallet that you control- a wallet where you know the private keys or a multi word seed. 
If you just know a password to access the site, but not the private keys, the site owns the coins and gives you permission to do as you please with it. If you know the keys, the coins are all yours

Unfortunately you cannot find out the owner of the address(if there is even an owner)...there's only one transaction going in. Your coins are unfortunately lost forever unless you can find the private key for the address at directory.io

Really? I understand an hour or two delay for security checks but I would consider that instant enough. Any way you can tell me why cash deposits can be frozen? Hasn't happened to me yet(knock on wood)..
Yeah thats the point I was getting to, the US seems to be a bit behind and was wondering if there are any services that match the 1/2 hour/instant-ness of bank transfers. I just had a browse around LocalBitcoins and it seems most of the cash deposit banks are small ones that don't really have branches in new York. Thanks for your input mate

Lotta transactions today. I bought earlier and the coins were funded by circle after 3 hours.

Hw1 is really good. Great security and convenience. It's just a really flimsy cheap feeling device though and its a bit too small for my liking. But it does it's job wonderfully

Think of it as your online bank account. You don't need to download anything to "receive money", it just shows up once it's processed by your bank. This is the same with bitcoin except it just shows up immediately. Same with "sending money", in your normal online banking, you enter the amount and account details of the person your sending money to and click send. This is the same with bitcoin except you don't enter personal details, but a bitcoin address
There is no need to download anything except a wallet application which is similar to your online banking application/website

Users don't pay fee. It's the receiver that pays fees. If you send a gift  it's free. But if you buy something for $20, the buyer receives $19.20

Hi yeah I know that would be the safest way but it's quite inconvenient to have to arrange a meetup. I was hoping to do it via LocalBitcoins escrow. That way I can release coins whenever buyer transfers me money in a quick/non-reversible method.thabks for your input about the gift cards

When u initialize it, they tell you to write down a list of 24 words. That is your backup. Reenter these words next time you initialize your wallet/lose your wallet because these words are your funds

Congrats man, I'm estimating I will join the club with you in about 3 months :) 
@_date: 2016-09-12 12:37:04
You previously withdrew your entire LBC wallet into your own personal wallet and there's a fee for that which brings you into negative
 Its paid once you refill your wallet. Its totally normal
@_date: 2016-09-05 16:22:11
Oh wait, I just read that part about ID. You don't ever need ID to transfer coins. Just to buy them off certain places, you do

All 21million coins will be mins, but transaction fees will still exist. A bitcoin now is worth 600usd. By 2040, hopefully coins will be worth amounts much much larger than that and  transaction fees will be worth mining for.

very helpful input. thanks!

Yeah install their chrome plug in and plug it in, it'll tell you to create a new wallet on it. Maybe you can increase your security better if you turn off your internet connection when doing this

When you withdraw your local bitcoins wallet into your personal wallet, there's a small fee. If you withdraw your entire balance into your wallet,  the fee makes you go into debt which will be repaid next time you load up your localbitcoins wallet

I got an email saying 3 friends need to use my link and make at least a £200 transfer for me to get £50. But thanks for using it mate!:)

In local bitcoins, there is a tab transat says sell coins and select GBP and united kingdom. Pick someone that has an ad up to sell coins to and give them the info from your friends account. They will deposit the money into their account and when you verify the money is in your friends account, you will then release the coin
@_date: 2016-09-13 21:24:01
Please use my link :) thanks!
@_date: 2016-09-05 16:21:38
You can transfer as much or as little as you want. That's the beauty of bitcoin
