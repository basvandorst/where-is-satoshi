Say hi to Tim!

CAVirtex is still the best Canadian-based exchange, at least for now. 
If you think the volume is low, look at LibertyBit... low fees, but nobody's doing anything there.
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:19:17
Thanks! (I already started playing while waiting...)
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:23:37
This happened just before my alarm was set to go off this morning. What a weird thing to wake up to!

I agree this isn't a fair comparison. First off, I'm glad BitPay is doing so well and hope they continue to grow.
But to compare a payment processor's sales to those of a website/marketplace seems a bit odd.

The article has nothing to offer anyone.  He doesn't say anything about anything...
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:14:14
I have been exploring this myself, but when you take into account all the various fees, it only really works if you have some serious money to play with.
You pay fees every which way... putting money into one exchange, then withdrawing from the other, then starting the whole thing over again.  Not saying it can't be done, you just have to think it through and do the math.

I was pumped when I got more yesterday at under $200... I was waiting for my bank transfer to go through, worried I'd miss my chance, but it got there just in time.
Every day is an all time high now.  There's no turning back.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:28:34
That was an absolutely terrible article.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:20:25
LibertyBit's volume is still quite modest at &lt; 100/day.
CAVirtex on the other hand regularly handles 1500+/day.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:34:32
Wow! What's everybody so angry about over there?
@_date: 2013-06-21 12:51:35
You must be new here.

I have mixed feelings about Berwick. My initial impression was he's a douche. He does handle himself well in interviews, and did help bring some attention to Bitcoin. I still think he's a bit of a douche.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:31:09
I've had nothing but good experiences with CAVirtex, although there have been some times where service could have been faster. Yesterday was a holiday in Canada, so banks were closed, and I'm sure that didn't help your issue. Good luck and keep us posted.
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:38:06
Congrats! Did you advertise the fact that you accept bitcoin anywhere, or did people just choose that payment option when they came to buy the book?
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:15:54
Clearly a scam...
Their miner is a photoshopped version of BFL's.
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:15:53
Anyone have firsthand experience with Libertybit? I've been thinking of trying them out as an alternative to CaVirtex. (Liberty's fees are only 0.5% compares to 3% at CaVirtex)

This whole "Lance G" blackmailer story has been confused and re-reported by so many websites.
Originally, Bitcoinstore posted that they were being blackmailed by "Lance G" for $5,000. Then some news site completely confused the story, reporting it was the Silk Road being blackmailed.
Now every lame "news" site is picking up the completely incorrect story and spreading this garbage all over
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:33:51
Just curious, did you acquire the Bitcoin recently, or are you one of the lucky ones who've had them from way back when they weren't worth as much?
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:08:14
Jumping in.. would love to help test.
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:04:30
This is an awesome idea! Along the same lines of the ~~guy~~ girl who's living on Bitcoin for a week, this is a cool way to bring attention to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:08:04
Sure... I totally believe they are destroying the private key...
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:08:56
Start 3 months ago.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:35:53
I'm still waiting for my bank transfer to go through from last Wednesday... I was hoping to get ~~some more~~ another Bitcoin before they hit $200.
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:40:56
By definition, Bitcoin is a digital currency, so it relies on electricity/the internet to function.
If there was no electricity, people wouldn't be using bank cards or credit cards, either. Same goes for Paypal or any other sort of online-based payment method.

No lag for the first time in weeks!

Probably downvoted because it's been posted a bunch of times already. OP's username is very appropriate.

LibertyBit's prices do seem higher overall, but their fees are considerably lower than CAVirtex's. 
I'm hoping LibertyBit picks up, but their volume is tiny compared to CAVirtex (88 vs. 1600 today, for example).
Either way, good to see some more competition in Canada.
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:19:00
Not worth the wait, IMO. By the time BFL ships something, Avalon will already be shipping batch 7, and hopefully we'll have someone else in the market by then, adding some real competition.
I ordered from BFL about a month ago, but cancelled my order after reading about all the delays, etc. I was order  and assuming that is my actual place in line (or close to it), I was pretty sure I would never receive anything from BFL, so I got a refund.
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:30:36
I wish. I recently went back and checked on the BTC I bought almost a year ago. 24 BTC @ $4.67.  If I had kept them, I could have sold them today and made $2000 profit...
It's sad to think about these things, but that's the nature of it. Don't dwell on what could have been.  Onward and upward!
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:37:07
I'm not sure who's buying at that price, but there's some good arbitrage opportunities between LibertyBit and CAVirtex for sure.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:46:50
I agree... you really need to plan it out. It definitely can be done, it's just a matter of thinking it through. 
I'm inspired now to actually try this and see how it works out.
