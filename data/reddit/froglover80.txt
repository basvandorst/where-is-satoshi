I wouldn't be surprised if PayPal eventually tries to buy BitPay.

There has been many people who have. Someone did it for an NSX. Go with what you believe. No one knows the future of bitcoin. If it is less than half of your total BTC, I would say go for it. I have one BTC that I bought at $400. I'm hoping for this exact situation you're debating right now but for any car. 
Good luck with either decision.

I have a job. I don't know what me having a job has to do with you though.
Good luck in your search. :)

Getting robbed.

I would say it depends on how you hand out your business card. I'm sure a lot of people just toss them away without even reading them.
You also have to think about your ROI. Most people won't want to go through the hassle to get $.50, so they'll just toss it. How many can be tossed before it isn't worth it for you?

Beat me to it. I would give you a tip, but I don't have the bitcointip bot set up, and I doubt you're the sex that I want to give the other tip to. :O
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:44:26
Good idea. I didn't think about that.

Reading this article annoyed me. How about anyone else? It lacked... everything. As if it were thrown together in 5 minutes without a care. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:08:34
How's the quality?

I couldn't agree more, but unfortunately I can see it.

"Intermediate Code (begins with "passphrase")"
I have no idea what that means, or what to put there. Can you clue me in a bit? I really want to order 2 encrypted cards (to put in two safe locations) and also 2 receive cards (in case one gets worn out).
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:58:12
I'm going to be ordering cold storage cards, which I may carry one on me.
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:36:27
Thanks for all the help, I'm definitely going to go with them.

You forgot 7! is filled with a ton of tinfoil-hat wearing people.

Capital letters = truth
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:25:33
That makes a lot of sense, and I appreciate all that. I'm going to get on it, and order some cards. These are inexpensive, and look amazing. 
Do they ship to the states? If so, how much extra?
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:14:25
Thank you for asking this question. I was wondering the same thing. :)
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:11:28
I typed it quickly and I realized the error after I submitted it. I tried to edit it already but apparently you can't.
I didn't think it was worthy of your attempt at a joke.

I'm just reading. I don't even have any bitcoins to thank him...
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:06:32
Wait, red flags were raised, you kept on because you saw dollar signs and now you expect Neteller to pick up the bill?
That makes sense. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:37:52
He can't be crying too bad since there aren't any typos. :(  
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:55:38
Thank you for this! I appreciate it. :) 
What I was reading mentioned very little about this more about how to buy bitcoin, wallets, and to be safe.

I'm not new to reddit, I've been a long time lurker but this is the first time I've seen this ad. 
Anyone want to fill me in on some basics?
I'll love you forever if you do.
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:56:49
This became a lot more popular than I thought it would! Thank you all for the very warm welcome and information.
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:54:05
Well thank him for it. It looks like I have a lot of reading to do!
