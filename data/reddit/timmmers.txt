I think we are doing well considering Gox was such terrible news. Well informed people may not have trusted Gox, but for a long time it was all people heard of and where many new people bought bitcoin. It's only natural for people to be wary for a while when something so public and bad happens, the words "don't trust exchanges" are everywhere and I think people who were thinking about buying bitcoin may not understand the recent events and hold off for a while. Some half decent good news might tempt them back, after all the biggest driver with humans is greed. If they judge the risk against potential gains..a lot will jump in for fear of losing out. Back in July a few of us were guessing where we'd be in a year from then, calculating if our rigs would pay off or not. We didn't think it would hit 500 dollars today let alone the bubble of 1000. 500 is good for most people, and to me proves bitcoin has enough behind it not to hit rock bottom. After all, there's not much more bad shit can happen that hasn't already is there? :)

You did a good job there mate. I expected someone to mention Bitpay type services when he asked about the value being volatile though.
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:10:46
Bound to happen if everyone's selling who accepts them as paymment..it's the same as you selling them when you spend bitcoins with these companies. Not a good thing.

I don't think "old school" folk would leave large amounts on there, if they did especially with the warning signs over the last year ..well they took a big risk. It was an exchange, not a bank. It was a constant source of negative stories which hopefully will soon stop. In some ways it's good for bitcoin and all of us ..if only as a lesson to be careful where you keep your assets. 
Lessons will be learned from all this, hopefully money will be recovered. Then we move on wiser than before. 
Stay positive, hard as it may be. :)

Why would a business hold onto bitcoins? They need liquidity, they need cash to buy stock, they have books to balance, and they use a system that is easy for them to avoid price volatility by instantly selling bitcoins. They won't even think about holding onto them, looking at the way the price graphs look now..would you risk it? 
I think people have their heads stuck in the sand. The speculation and Chinese buying drove it up in price, that brought news about that rise, which brought new speculators for a time. Now we have a series of bad news items, lack of trust, falling prices, none of which bring in new money. People spending are selling in essence. Bitcoin is cheap now, people keep saying it's a good thing and they are going to buy...the graphs say otherwise. 
Selling more than buying drives down the price, selling stuff using Bitpay and the like is selling. The more of that there is, the result is obvious.

I tell people completely new to bitcoin that it works the same way as cash does as a payment option, but online, and there's a thing called the blockchain where every transaction is recorded for all to see but not who made the transactions. Unlike other payment options there's no-one to pay fees to or reverse the payment just like cash. 
The other use for it is speculation where people don't exchange payments for currency but keep it in th hope the exchange rate gives them a profit. I'd also say that many people who work in other countries send money home to families and pay a % todo this to a 3rd party and that this can be done instantly and free using bitcoins. Charities accepting bitcoin are doing well aslo due to the nature of the bitcoin community and the lack of fees, they get the whole donation and can accept micro donations as the fees aren't there.

I don't think miners are keen to cash out right now. Not when next gen rigs are required that can be bought with bitcoin and exchange is so low. I do know that rig manufacturers are though, to pay for production costs. Also a lot of them use Bitpay which is the same as cashing out. Same as miners doing it in effect probably though. A lot of the next gen rigs also suck up some serious power and will probably force at least some selling from miners to cover costs? I know quite a few miners are into altcoins now and buy BTC with them as it pays better sometimes...how that effects the market I haven't a clue. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:26:40
Why do the 2nd group "have to buy new bitcoins" ? No-one "has" to buy bitcoins, that's part of the problem. There are many other options. You don't even need to buy bitcoins to trade them now. There's a 3rd group too miners. 
If 100m new users use bitcoin via bitpay  or similar systems that's selling pure and simple and a big problem. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:15:57
Consumer adoption? The day that companies accept bitcoin and don't immediately exchange them will be a good thing, but all that transaction means is that someone bought bitcoins and sold them again ...via a trader. Where's the benefit in that to anyone ?

 is There you go Russ, you're a star :) they did a few studio interviews too, IMO that was important because the usual sad questions came up and were answered easily. :)

Profits are huge? Haha. Not these days. Rigs aren't thin air, nor is the juice they suck from the grid. 10k plus for a rig that uses 3kw...and orders for that 20nm machine that doesn't yet exist are being cancelled because it's looking very very unlikely to break even. My rig was a KNC state of the art back in Oct, and it never mined as many coins as I could have simply bought with the money I paid for it. In bitcoin terms it would have cost over 20, and has mined 11. Profits from thin air?

Then you didn't see the BBC piece yesterday which had a sensible guy from the uni on speaking several times, it's been used already. By foreign students who it was originally aimed at. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 08:41:33
Powerhouses? lol Not really. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 07:51:13
Google bitcoin and pizza. Miners created coins then someone got peckish and bought a some expensive pizza. lol
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:23:00
Reward goes down, people stop mining, difficulty drops, it's easier again, more worthwhile ... interesting question. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 03:14:27
That's amusing considering what the price will do BECAUSE Paypal get involved.

It might be good for some Chinese who would like to get in on that place...get them back in the game? 
@_date: 2014-01-28 08:16:27
There's no answer to this except to try and accurately estimate the cost and return in XBT for the mining rig you buy, and that's all but impossible. Example, I bought one. Pre-ordered in June, cost 2k dollars. It's made a profit in dollars due to the rise in the exchange rate, but not in coins. 
Manufacturers are the ones making the money, not the miners. Pre-ordering is the only way to get the latest rigs and avoid difficulty rises (caused by the same batch you're buying starting to hash to an extent), first delivery earns far more than last. Late or non-delivery is rife. 
If you get free or very cheap power it's worth mining, but the newest rigs worth having will be the 20nm ones this year and they look to be 2kw plus each which won't be the end of it. Mining got industrial for bitcoins. Alts, that's a better mining option right noe maybe. When my rig no longer pays it's power bill in the coming months I'll use it to mine some altcoins . The other option that many use is to mine for a while, keep those coins and ebay the rig for often more than it was bought for. Bigger fool syndrome I've seen it called. It works though. A rig the same as mine went on ebay for more than I paid last sunday...so in theory I could have my dollas back and the bitcoins were free.

Ebay supports sellers so well too lmao.

No you didn't. Business order stock credit or to replace sold merch...you think their suppliers are going to wait until the price rises? How about all those pesky overheads, bills, wages etc. and the tax man? Businesses need money in the bank, they borrow money not save it to survive and expand. Businesses are rarely holding cash especially these days. They don't even hold stock if they can help it, it's all money down the drain. Not making them anything, that's the aim of a business..to make money. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:52:16
Easy. Snd them to me and I'll send you 10 quid cash :)

Thanks for that, very interesting.

I recorded this on my TIVO, I'll have a go at clipping the bits out about bitcoin, they covered it pretty often and pretty well I thought. BBC Breakfast repeating boring stories every 15 minutes gets tedious, but in this case it was a good thing for bitcoin. More importantly, everyone they talked to did a great job and came across as sensible real world folk, not some crazy bunch of nerds :) 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:21:02
There we go head firmly in sand. How many REAL businesses accept bitcoin and have overseas suppliers? Most work on credit anyway, the larger ones. Why would they use bitcoin ? The value range today so far is $416.11 - $494.98 as I type this. There's their profit gone and some in less than a day. Or they could have converted to flat and be fine. Face it, it's a problem. Might be a very big one. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:39:03
Miners are not over compensated. Most miners would be better off buying bitcoin than spending money on ASICs. Been that way for some time too. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:48:58
test the address by sending a tiny payment to it, if it pans out the bitcoins may never have been sent ? 
@_date: 2014-01-28 12:12:17
Well you couldn't have done better then, shame they chose to cut such an important point eh?
@_date: 2014-01-24 07:56:36
This could allow merchants who wouldn't normally take card payments to do so, wouldn't it? The best thing about it to me though, it's pretty much explained in that video from the customer perspective...and most of the video is crossing the road. Simple. I'd target malls, with a promise to stick around a few days to introduce it to shoppers. Nice little media peice could be made for malls from that "Local mall 1st in area to accept bitcoins etc..." . I wish you luck.

These coins haven't vanished. They still exist somewhere and are traceable, so given the magnitude of this disaster/crime/cockup I'd think this story is far from over. I wouldn't close Pandoras box just yet, something could be  done to get at least a little compensation in time. 
Sad to see all these stories of people losing money they needed and their dreams with it sometimes. It wasn't easy to get large amounts from Gox for a long long time, so seeing it coming wasn't much help, nor is telling them with 20:20 hindsight how stupid it was  to leave coins there. I think that's clear now. Too clear. 
What happens now is most important, for all of us.

Dream on. We'll be lucky to see it hit 1k. Too many farms selling large quantities regularly. like this one KNC have  those are Jupiters BTW, each set of 2 fans visible is one rig. 6-700GH each rig.
