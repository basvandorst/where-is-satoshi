I certainly wouldn't. I'm in crypto to take the power away from the banks not hand more to them. I'll never be in a situation where anyone anywhere can decide if I can access my wealth, or lose it for me.

You might want to check  if you're sticking with a low amount. It's a cool way to exchange bitcoin without a full fledged hardware wallet. I wouldn't put too much on their though as it doesn't support a backup of the private key.

The first thing I would recommend is to try to work out an amount in fiat that will drop your level emotionally on a win or a loss. That amount is different for everyone, but if market swings are causing any more emotion then, say, a blown tire on the bad side or dinner with good friends on the high side, you're probably trading more than you're ready for. That'll change over time but you don't want to risk life changing sums right off the bat. 
I recommend this book for candlestick trading: 
It might seem a little strange at first, as it equates the market to an epic battle between the bears and the bulls, but when it soaks in a little it makes sense. It also gives some good examples of different signs to watch for and an idea of what they may mean.
In terms using candles, I don't use them to tell me when to trade, exactly. I do use them to tell me what the market has done up to the present. From that point I have to determine where it's going to move. 
For instance a hammer is a common buy signal. When you see a hammer at the end of a bear run you can determine from the candle that the bulls have pushed the bears downward advance back up. They finally held them off and managed to retake a little lost ground. That oftentimes means the bulls are going to retake more ground and drive the price upward, but not always. The candles can tell me what happened but it can't tell me what's going to happen. It's up to me to guess what the future holds.
The same really holds for technical signals too. They can be predictive, but they are never absolute.

I would export the keys to a multibit .key file, then open it in a text editor and import the individual keys into electrum.
I cleaned up a multibit classic wallet about 8 months ago and it took days to get through at the highest fee. I can't imagine it going through now with the mempool as full as it is.

Keep the trezor at home. Keep the wallet words in a bank safety deposit box. Problem solved.
Edit: if your worried about the bank add a password to your wallet so even with the words a bank robber can't get access.

If price isn't an issue buy them both. Either of them are worth having and it's good to have a spare if one breaks.

If you use a password plus the 24 words it generates a different set of addresses. Every different password used with the same 24 words will be a completely different set of wallets. Even with the 24 words it would be extremely difficult to brute force a password because you would have to try an infinite amount of passwords, and every password you try would give you a wallet. There's no "wrong" password. There's just one password that will generate a wallet that happens to have funds on it.
The pin code is not the password. The pin code secures access to the device.

There are limits but the numbers are so high that practically it's not possible. It would be like winning the lottery every day for a few hundred years. Yes, it could happen but I doubt we'll ever see it happen.

If it's multibit classic you'll want to export the keys out and import them into electrum or some other wallet. Multibit classic defaults to a very low fee that might not get mined. I cleared an old wallet a few months ago and it took forever for confirmations.

Long term stops (the 11 percent) are either hard on the exchange or bot driven. Day trading stops are more in my head than anything. They are pretty firm. I traded alts for two years for small amounts before I started making a profit, primarily due to getting emotional. It sounds like your struggling so here's some non financial advice, for what it's worth:
Never day trade to increase your btc holding. Day trade only to increase your fiat. If you want to hodl btc and day trade, put your btc on a wallet and hodl it. Don't touch it. Then buy and sell with fiat as you day trade. If you want to put your profits into more btc to hold, that's fine, but if you're trying to increase the quantity of btc in your trading account you can end up trying to serve two masters and fail them both.
Any profit is good profit. I always kicked myself for selling early, even when profitable. That was foolish. Any profit is profit. We will never sell the highest high or buy the lowest low. We just need to guess right more often then we guess wrong.
Don't be afraid to take a small loss if you think there's going to be a bigger one if you dont. It sucks to take a loss but it's better to sell at the beginning of a dump then the end. As long as you are trading to increase fiat, not btc, you can always buy back in.
Make the market work for your buys as well as your sells. If this isn't your only source of income and you're just learning then be patient and wait for a huge dump. Their not unusual. Don't rush in to buy when it looks like it's flying. Buy in when it's totally dumped and traders are crying tears of blood. That's where the smart money is buying. You might get lucky on a huge run up but more often then not you end up buying on top.
If you havent, get some books on candlestick trading. If you don't understand the charts and what they signify for the market you are essentially handing me your losses as my gains. I'll happily take them as it's an essential part of the game. Don't let me.
Buy other traders' fear and sell to other traders' greed. Don't do it the other way around.

I don't think you can export them from hd. Do you have your wallet words? You could import them into electrum I believe.

There will be more need for secure storage than there is now and I'm sure the market will fill the void 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:06:14
That's correct. When day trading I look at the lowest point of the candle on, or right before, I buy. I use that as my stop. I'm essentially betting that it's going up from there so if it goes under that point I've bet wrong and will take the loss.
Longer trades I set at 11 percent under my buy price and essentially chase the high. I always move a stop upward when the high moves up, but never downward. This isn't necessarily my sell point. I'll sell if I think bad things are going to happen. This is just my backup for when things go bad and I'm asleep.
The 11 percent is really based on how volatile the market is. I would close it a lot tighter in a less volatile market. You need to leave room for regular market movement, but still want to make sure you can cash out in a bad dump. Then, if your lucky, you can pick up more at the bottom of the dump and chase it all the way back up to previous highs.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:45:36
If I'm day trading i use the low wick on the candle where I think the breakout will occur for my stop. Typically its not there long as im daytrading the 15 minute charts. If I'm lazy I use a bot to keep a trailing stop 11 percent under the high since I bought, with trades executing once or twice a week.
Disclaimer: My trading account is in fiat right now until the market makes up its mind what it's going to do.

Right now there's a good hammer forming on gdax dailys after two days of downward motion. Furthermore the lowest low is somewhere around 13.5k (eyeballing it) for the last three days. That tells me that there is at least some support around 13.5k. With a hammer forming we might be seeing an upward breakout tomorrow but I'm not buying a long term hold position yet, because futures might force things down. Instead I'll wait and see what tomorrow brings and if I do decide to buy I'll set a stop a hair under 13.5, but closer to 13 where my gut says there is a lot more support. If the market reaches there then it's broken through support and I don't want to risk a bigger drop.
Now say I want to do some day trading instead of longer term. I'll take a look at the 15 minute chart, absorb the value of each swing, and I might place a buy right after a low when the swing up starts. If I was short on cash I probably would, because the 24 hour chart hammer seems to be indicating an upward break. That means that not only am I trying to catch it on the 15 minute chart on the way up the daily is also indicating it might swing up, and day trading when the daily is moving up is pretty easy money if I don't get greedy.
But if I don't need the money I'm not even going to day trade today. Instead I'll be patient and let the market reinforce the daily hammer by pushing up a little on tomorrow's candle. That'll indicate to me that we've had a little consolidation and it's safe to place a trade. 
It takes more than a little patience to wait for the right buy I'm moment but that's just as important, if not more important, then knowing when to exit.
This is not financial advice and your milage may vary.

A large chunk of low fee transactions were dropped from the mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:10:35
It would be impossible for the transaction to go twice through the blockchain. I'd bet the exchange screwed up and credited you for the one transaction twice.
I'd be cautious of that exchange. If it's happening to you it's probably happening with others which means that they have more bitcoin on their books then they have in their wallet.

Not to put a damper on the fun, but if you do have a coinbase account and if you use sms 2 factor you might want to change quickly. This might be an attempt to see if you have a coinbase account and end with hijacking your phone.

Most exchanges are not insured and are under no regulatory authority. Mt Gox, for instance, caused a huge amount of losses for users, as did Cryptsy and if memory serves Mintpal. 
Long story short exchanges are dangerous in the wild world of crypto. Hardware and paper wallets allow for long term storage that is safer than online options.

Go to bitaddress.org to generate them. Print out at 75%. Laminate if at all possible and if you do laminate then pick up some 1.5 x 1 inch "scratch off" stickers to cover the private key and barcode. 
I just did a batch up and they make excellent handouts for christmas.
If you're putting significant amounts on them you should do some research on how to do them securely. The above assumes only a few mBTC per wallet. 
EDIT: u/cantonbecker, reply below, offers an excellent boot disk that I use when making paperwallets securely on his site. I don't use his designs but I highly recommend grabbing his Linux boot disk for secure creation.

Teslin paper works great for ink jet. It's basically plastic. Water won't destroy it and you can't even tear it. Cover it with a 3mil laminate and you're good to go.

This works too. I actually use bitaddress.org source booted from the CD from bitcoinpaperwallet.com because I'm too lazy to make my own Linux boot disk.

It's traders that already had their btc on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:08:13
I have coins I hodl including btc and some derived alts. I actively trade a small percentage of my btc with fiat and I do set stops so I can trade out as high as possible when the greed starts to fade and trade back in when the panic starts to subside.
Done well you can increase your portfolio. Done poorly and it can cost you over the long term. Hodl is a good strategy and I highly recommend it to anyone that isn't comfortable taking losses while they learn not to panic day trading. 
Edit: I had my panic and greed backwards. I'm a dope.

I get this sometimes when tor is acting up. It usually gives me a choice to save the transaction to rebroadcast when it gets a connection. I tell it to save then exit and restart the app (and tor) and it sends after it restarts.

I printed my own laminated cards this year. Cost was about 55.00 total on amazon to buy the special paper, laminator, cheap paper cutter, and scratch off stickers. I used the cards at bitaddress.org printed at 75 percent size, then laminated them and covered the private area with the scratch off stickers.
In my opinion the results were superb and I didn't have to trust a third party to print the cards.

Right now I don't know of any wallets that let you do that. However, there's no reason that bitcoin can't be scaled out to less then a satoshi... ie 0.00000000000000001 or more. The limit of 0.00000001 isn't written in stone.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:40:43
The point of every wallet is to not share the private key with anyone. Paper wallets are ideal for long term storage as no hacker can steal the private key, but eventually if you want to spend it you have to enter the key in something that can make a transaction.
If you will be spending periodically but don't want to trust software use a hardware wallet. If you have a lot of coins use paper wallets for long term storage and hardware wallets for your spending money.

If the order / # placement of the 8 words are known and they don't include the last word then it's something like 2048 to the third power plus the checksum. The last word contains some data for the key but also acts as a checksum of the first 11 words, so less options would have to be tried to find the last word as only some would work as a checksum.
Long story short generate a new wallet and move your funds to it.  2048 to the third isn't much.

I see two private keys. One private key translates to a vanity address (according to the OP, at least). One does not. The private keys are similar. Where is the miraculous proof that should make me believe this is satoshi? Has anyone even tried to see if the keys are valid? I'm not going to waste my time to do so. I would expect, btw, that the myfun vanity address key is correct. Who the he'll knows if the other one is correct as it's not sha256 according to the OP. For all I know he just copied the original and changed 4 characters. 
More importantly, why on earth would Satoshi decide to out himself in this way? That makes zero sense to me at all. It doesn't pass the smell test. Therefore I believe this is a cryptographic card trick. 
I'm a lowly programmer, BTW. I don't specialize in cryptography so feel free to believe what you would like.
