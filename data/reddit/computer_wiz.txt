Intel has Management Engine post core 2 chipsets

Weird how it looked the same during the "Media Attention" phase but just kept going up.

3rd quarter 2018
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:24:46
Lol what
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:56:20
Obvious scam
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:51:46
I can only imagine one who would wear something like this.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:57:51
I am just going to take a wild guess without reading the article. Because they are poor?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:44:58
Im not a bubble, you're a bubble, bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:07:55
A little premature to call the death of Ebay don't you think?
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:55:07
Just tried to buy some groceries, didn't work. Just tried to get fuel, didn't work. Cash is just better at the moment for some things, surely you can agree with that.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:31:56
You are very angry
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:14:43
Yeah what a dumby
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:00:08
If you, as a person, existed as an entire government? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:07:18
Not surprising, they supposedly hired you.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:16:06
True bitcoiners wouldnt have a boss lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:45:56
Just because you can do something another way doesn't mean it isn't useful. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:23:05
Prey for it
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:50:21
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:29:07
If you can't think of a way to make this happen, you handling the finances probably is the worst thing you can do for your future.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:55:41
Including you
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:41:20
It doesn't get easier because we're invested emotionally and financially in it.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:17:10
Great insight
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:24:34
I wonder what kind of intelligent conversation OP was expecting from a post like this.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:55:52
This is not a Coinbase support subreddit.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:13:57
Yuck..what is going on in people's head when they post garbage like this.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:52:53
You answered them yourself. If people are in need of Western Union to get fiat quick, more than likely Bitcoin isn't the answer for them, at least it's current stage. Cash just does some things better right now, and that is fine.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:53:09
Contact Wave? Not sure what this has to do with Bitcoin or crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:55:21
Terrible post.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:27:01
Also bitcoin is terrible to use as a currency currently.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:17:37
Lol love the reviews of the app.

I liked him better when he was singing about hamburgers and margaritas
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:59:33

I can't wait until the word dies
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:28:17
Merchant adoption is actual usage right? When people use Western Union I would image they need money fast. Surely you can send BTC fast and cheap now with LN. Getting the money isn't the only problem, it is being able to spend it.

Lol is this a real post? You parents don't owe you shit kid

Here is last comment before this post:
"Do you have a boyfriend??? Lucky fucking man if so. I'd never let that go :)" on a gonewild post.

What's the point of this thread.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:34:57
Lol from a 1 week old account.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:09:00
Your dad should be investigated.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:15:26
Because he didn't get in when he should have LOL. mad kid is mad.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:27:30
Then what happened in the movie?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:22:54
This is corny as fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:01:54
Yeah his early 2000s infiniti and shitty housing area screams rich.

Yes! They do give refunds, but it depends where you bought it from. I have luck on a large exchange by calling them and explaining my mistake very clearly and sincerely but not really meaning it ��
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:15:20
Does know how to post an article?
