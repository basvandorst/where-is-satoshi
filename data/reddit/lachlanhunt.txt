I've had some coins in my private wallet for a while now. I understand that my coins are now valid on both chains. Does this mean I can theoretically also spend them on both sides of the fork independently of each other?

The benefit of having 2.1*10^15 is that it can be represented as an integer in 64 bit floating point systems, which allows programming languages that don't have 64 bit integer types to implement a bitcoin system without having to have a special big number class. e.g. JavaScript always uses 64 bit floating point numbers, following IEEE 754.
64 bit floating point can represent [integers up to 2^53-1]( requiring 53 bits (only 52 are stored and the remaining 12 bits are used to represent the sign and the exponent).  Beyond that, rounding errors occur, which is a problem for representing currency.  [2.1*10^15 requires 51 bits]( to represent. Adding just one more decimal place, allowing for [2.1*10^16 units requires 55 bits](

One problem with just dropping -coin like that is that the name clashes with an existing unit of data, especially when you go the other direction to kilobit and megabit.
It might be better to come up with a general purpose abbreviation for the name "bitcoin" other than bit to eliminate any ambiguity. e.g. "bic". I'm not sure it would catch on, but "microbic", "millibic", "bic" and "kilobic" don't sound too bad.  Or, alternatively, drop the "bit-" and go with coin, millicoin, kilocoin, etc.

I propose to instead abbrevate bitcoin as "bic", and use SI prefixes properly: millibic and microbic. That avoids the problem of using "bit", which clashes when talking about kilobits for 1000 bitcoins.

I signed up for coinbase and then I tried Cycle. Looks good so far. I'll give it a go.
Though, it would need LastPass (and other password managers) integration so that I can log into all those websites without having to go and copy and paste passwords from my browser first.

I don't think it's the rationale for it, just a lucky coincidence. Others like litecoin have ignored the problem entirely and can represent many more coins.
So, it's certainly not a showstopper, but certainly something to consider. Such a change would require updating every client in the network before they could accept any transactions dealing in nanobitcoins.

MiB is [mebibyte]( KiB is [kibibyte](

It's been 2 days, and I'm sure I signed up before your cutoff of 18:00 PST on the 21st, and I don't see any bitcoins in my coinbase account. Are you still processing them all, or did I miss out for some reason?
