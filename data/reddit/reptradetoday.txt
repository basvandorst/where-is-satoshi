And how is that their fault? That's as dumb of an argument as saying that Grocery Stores defeat the purpose of gardens.

I personally know people who have in excess of 30k BTC, and none of them work anymore. They just trade. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:30:53
The same people that whine about Western Union being Trojans, or bad for bitcoin are the people that shit themselves when Bitcoin's Fiat valuation drops 5%. You can't disconnect bitcoin from the rest of the financial market if you want to use it for mainstream products. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 18:55:43
Show me a single instance where they have stolen someone's money please. Oh you can't, well I guess that's why people call you an idiot.

Capital = Good code? Not really.
@_date: 2016-04-28 13:10:21
Absolutely, my example was very conservative.
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:36:34
Where do you get that Core doesn't require full blockchain to send a transaction? I have never heard that before? Also. It's the fee.
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:09:31
Me? You are arguing with the actual poster. How do you not realize how stupid that is? Coinbase has brought more people into Bitcoin than anything.
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:36:53
He just said he didn't. That's just an idiot comment.
@_date: 2016-04-29 18:18:12
Because PayPal allows 90-days for transaction returns. He can just report fraud and claim you never sent it. PayPal will side with the customer 100% of the time. This has happened 100s of times.
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:09:28
It didn't come and pass, we are in the middle. How dumb do you have to be to think that full blocks isn't a problem?
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:32:18
No, all trading isn't gambling. You can successfully trade mathematically with exceptionally high chance of positive report. Going margin long or short in an asset that moves 5% a day, with 100x leverage is literally no better than betting it all on black. And that is if you are trading at a reputable exchange, which you probably are not at 100x. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 13:20:04
Your argument isn't sound. There is absolutely no reason to think that a closed source product will 'always diverge from market demands' just as there is absolutely no reason to think that an open source product somehow represents the wishes of the users. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 18:36:31
Yeah, and once the signs were there you couldn't withdraw anymore. So, have a cookie dumbfuck.
@_date: 2016-04-28 13:08:22
I just think Mycelium is a great wallet, and they have lots of interesting things they could tie into the API. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 13:28:42
In all fairness, no one will be affected by this giant dumbfuck.
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:59:39
Didnt' see it. And no, of course Mycelium won't ever be the only wallet. That's just stupid. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:36:30
No, Iranian Americans that access their account from IRAN, that is on a US sanctions list should have their heads examined. Why would you expect Coinbase to act differently than ANY financial institution? 
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:29:54
What are you whining about? Coinbase is exactly what they say they are. They are a bank and exchange that allows you to buy bitcon! You must be the dumbest kid in Reykjavik if you don't understand that. They aren't any damn gatekeeper because you don't have to use them. Bitcoin itself is as free as it's ever been, and if you use a 3rd party you are always at the mercy of that companies rules, and the government regulations they have to abide by. Maybe would like them all to be MtGox or CoinJar? Cause not following regulations sure worked out well for Charlie Shrem and his customers. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:31:05
It is a 'real' Bitcoin ETF. This just shows that the current owners value bitcoin far over what we in crypto consider 'market price' just because we all know how to fund semi-shady exchange accounts and keep track of private keys. Buying this ETH removes those hurdles. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:33:21
The market is never irrational. it's the most rational measure we have.
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:31:52
Sooo many tinfoil hats and idiot's here. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 18:53:55
Because people are too stupid to realize that Coinbase follows KYL, and bank regulations. aka. People are idiots.
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:09:59
Dumbest comment of the day right here. 'If it's open source, it will always be popular'? 
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:41:20
You are about 5 years too late to find anyone dumb enough to sell Bitcoin for paypal. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:26:04
I have one, and it's awesome.
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:08:58
The only people that aren't worried about block size are the people that are too dumb to understand Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:06:29
And I think you need to take some classes, read a book, and ask yourself "Is Coinbase Bitcoin?". Then get back to me on how they should stay compliant with US money transfer and banking regulations, and still 'be just like bitcoin'. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:35:54
But then don't use it. I don't get your point.
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:32:55
Of course it's a premium. The premium is based on supply and demand,  and also the fact that the ETF removes the technical boundaries for Bitcoin ownership. I think you underestimate how huge this is for 90%+ of investors out there. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 18:29:14
Not really short term, just insecure if you handle it a lot since the private key can't be backed up.
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:42:59
Before 90-days you have no idea how profitable since most buyers use stolen credit cards, or file payment returns. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 18:59:28
This sub is full of idiots, that do dumb shit like log into their account from Iran, and send tons of stolen coin to a regulated exchange and then throw a bitchfit when they have problems. I know 10+ people that have used Coinbase for 2+ years and none of them have had a single issue. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 15:58:17
Meet in person, offer him a 'verified' Physical Bitcoin for cash (that you have written down the private key for). Then immediately after he buys it, sweep the key. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 18:55:04
Coinbase isn't bitcoin you child. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:00:15
No shit Eistein. Show me a single person who has had money stolen, or indefinitely frozen for no reason. And no, if you log in from Iran, you are an idiot and they are right to freeze your funds. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:40:19
Don't do something as dumb as selling Bitcoin on eBay and you will be fine.

He has absolutely no idea what it is, but he has so many plans and so many best people. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 15:59:02
Someone needs to take a little Midol for that heavy flow.
@_date: 2016-04-27 14:13:27
crash? ha ha ha, oh dear. Welcome to Bitcoin, where 5% is common, and 30% happen.
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:00:59
They can happily sue you. I know people who have had their checking accounts go $10k in the red after PayPal forced funds out of their account. Read their TOS. Oh wait, it's actually 180 days  in some cases. so Have fun with that. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 18:56:38
Yeah, who is he to have an opinion.,, please just go away moron.
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:24:31
This is also what happens when straight up retarded leverage like 20x and 50x is available in a market where the asset moves 1-3% regularly, and exchanges can just use their customers wallets as hedge. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 13:09:26
I'm not necessarily saying it's 'evil' just saying that it's not trading, it's gambling. 50x margin on Bitcoin is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 500x on any larger currency or Oil, and it's insane.
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:40:02
Hmm, interesting. Could be huge, or a massive money sink.
@_date: 2016-04-28 13:11:45
Who has ever claimed that?
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:22:04
What you should offer is a manufacturing consultancy service where someone can send you a picture or link to a product, and you find out manufacturing costs for different sized series. I bet there is a huge market for this. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 13:11:05
You sir, are an idiot that probably got burned on some copy-paste alt ICO. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:37:38
Queen, cause the show must go on.
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:44:32
Of course, if you understand how bitcoin works, you would realize that it doesn't work that way. I can prove it by selling you my private key with 5 BTC for $500.
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:31:20
It's not strange at all to me that a bank abiding by KYL rules and anti money laundering laws, not to mention sanctions would not be super tickled by someone accessing their service from Iran. How is that a surprise?
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:24:39
Just get a Piper Wallet instead. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 18:29:50
Read their FAQ.
@_date: 2016-04-29 13:39:58
I think people bash Coinbase because they have the wrong expectations. Just because they deal in Bitcoin doesn't mean they can just act like rogues and not follow traditional banking regulations. I think Charlie Shrem can tell you about that. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:54:39
So, that's your answer. Strong argument, you must have been in debate in middle school.
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:16:29
Ha ha, Bitclub network ain't giving shit back. That guy is BONED! And they just mined a 315 BTC block. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:25:13
These types of 'margin flashcrashes' are a daily occurrence and doesn't affect the trajectory of the trend. I expect us over 470 by tomorrow.
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:17:30
But that has nothing to do with open source. You can't just open source a sub-par product, and expect change. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:44:56
You make great points, and I have no issue with that sentiment. But to consider a service 'a necessary evil' and ACTUALLY accusing them of being evil when their business model is exactly what they say it is, and their terms exactly what they claim is just juvenile and stupid. Sure, I am all for weening the masses off Coinbase, but doing so by slandering them and wildly accusing them is a damn childish way to achieve anything.
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:48:10
Absolutely 100% no reason to split any amount of you secure your private key appropriately. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:08:09
Supply doesn't remain constant at all, how are you not understanding that the reward is cut by 50% but difficulty remains. With price rising, there is absolutely no way that 50% of miners will drop out, and diff can not reset fast enough anyway. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:40:07
I wouldn't say worse than any fiat bank. I would say, handling hundreds of millions in transactions and likely far more scrutinized by the government than any bank. If I ran Coinbase I would be absolutely NAZI about KYL to not give anyone a reason to shut me down. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:38:59
Amazing that these idiots still think people are going to buy that they are selling you $20 for $19..
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:15:51
"Bitcoin is fine, we don't need to raise the block size, just let the fee-market take care of it" - :)
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:28:20
Interestingly, this type of manipulation is actually exceptionally profitable if you have enough collateral. Say you are expecting Bitcoin to hit $500 within a month. You use 5k BTC to short at 465, then you use 10k BTC to crash the market, and close your short at a leveraged profit, while going long at the bottom. Bitcoin hits $500 and you have made 3x as much as just letting it ride. If you have $5 million, the Bitcoin market is literally the most profitable thing since.. I can't even think of anything more profitable
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:09:41
What does that have to do with the fact that Coinbase has to follow the most basic US bank sanctions and by LAW freeze and investigate any account with possible electronic ties to Iran? Damn you are stupid. It's like you don't even know vaguely how financial transactions work.
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:32:36
So many tinfoil wearing idiots here. Go ahead, access your Bank account from Iran and see how that goes for you. Also, who the fuck vacations in Iran? Coinbase isn't some evil entity because they have to abide by KYL you morons.
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:37:35
I don't get the reference. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:31:48
Sure it can, if it also removes the difficulty of holding private keys or fund an exchange. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:37:27
Absolutely zero affiliation other than the fact that I think the Bitcoin community is acting like a group of immature children.
