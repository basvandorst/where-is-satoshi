The first cross-national highway was private. Your statements are more about your ignorance of history then anything 
Conceived in 1912 by Indiana entrepreneur Carl G. Fisher, and formally dedicated October 31, 1913, the Lincoln Highway spanned coast-to-coast from Times Square in New York City to Lincoln Park in San Francisco, originally through 13 states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and California.

You answered your own question.

I gave my old IBM clicky to my mother since for some reason she kept breaking keyboards. Shes had the same one for almost a decade now. 
And with more then half a dozen generic keyboards just sitting around, its basically impossible to justify.

Oh man. I wish I could justify spending 80$ on a USB ibm clicky keyboard. But having so many old computer parts just lying around, it would be such a waste.

The government nationalized them, and nobody can compete with government as government is paid via taxes and has a monopoly on the use of force.
Your comments further reflect your ignorance of history.

This post is hilarious because you are just giving throwaway-o more proof that he was right.
