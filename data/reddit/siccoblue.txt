Yeah there's a transfer ID, where do I go to check it?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:58:10
I'm not positive which it was because I seem to have like ten of them which it changes between, if you like I could give you a list of all of them?
That's what scared me in the first place I feel like it changed after I copied it but I'm not positive
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:31:11
Weird I can't click on it, pasting it into an explorer doesn't work either
Really hope it works! Thanks

They gave me a transfer ID, it's the only info GDAX gives me about it and electrum has like 15 different wallet address so I'm not positive when one I sent it to but they're all empty, how would I find this info? Sorry I'm completely new to all of this

Because he invested in r/btc

Probably a few cents In most cases, $10-15 to someone who might want it for personal use

Why does everyone think old/high karma accounts hold any value?
99.999% accounts sold are 1-3 weeks old with about 1k of each type of karma, buying a high karma/old account does the type of people who buy accounts no good, they take waaaaayyy longer to make and there's no advantage to having a 500k karma account over a 5k karma account and there's no advantage to having an 11 year old account over a 1 month old account, by that point any restrictions are lifted regardless and the type of people who buy accounts simply want bulk accounts in most cases
Having high karma or being aged doesn't make you any less likely to be banned, and if you're buying accounts it's for one of three reasons
1: for personal use (extremely unlikely, just make one)
2: spamming (will be banned within a few days)
3: selling upvotes (no clear way to tell how long they last but it doesn't matter because you're probably getting hundreds of thousands of accounts at a time)
Account selling doesn't happen like the average person would tell you, I probably couldn't even get $100 for my account and I have a shitload of karma, it holds no value to the type of people who actually buy Reddit accounts

So what is this exactly? And what is the benefit of running one? Just helping the community?

r/BtcWritesBBT ?

I only invest in memes, my karma gainz are huge

Exactly, you could be in the negatives, it's an investment and carries the risks like any other, not a magic ticket to riches
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:36:00
It's incredibly volatile and the way most people use it is in fact as an investment, not a day to day currency, a huge percentage buys it simply for the possibility of growth of what they put in
