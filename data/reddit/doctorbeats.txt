Yes. Note the numbers on the right change their scale as y increases

Is this the type of thing you download and then oops all your crypto is gone?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:06:03
They don’t let you trade unless you have a load of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:46:18
Will you have to pay taxes on that?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:20:22
Two basic scenarios:
1) If you want to buy BTC, futures allow you to leverage your money (buy more with less).  The cost is that you have to predict accurately the price of BTC in the future.  So up to now, we only had one option; buy BTC an HODL.  We assume the price will got up and if it does we gain value.  If it doesn't we lose value.  Buying a futures contract allows one to say (ELI5)"Ill put up $15,000 with the agreement that if by next February, the price of BTC will be $18000, and if it is, you will give me not one bitcoin, but three.   If it does not reach $18000 then I give you the full $15000."   This allows people that believe the price is going up to bet less to get more, the price of that benefit being that if your areincorrect, the loss is immediate and not recoverable.
2)Shorting: used for those that have a good amount of BTC.  If there is a sharp parabolic rise like we have seen recently, these people can hedge their position with a short.  (short digression: Bitcoin is now more mainstream than ever but most people acknowledge there is still a risk of total collapse.  The 2013 selloff saw 80% losses from the peak.) That being said, if there is a continued parabolic rise in the value of BTC, the futures market allows people to buy a contract that says (ELI5)" The price of BTC is now $50,000. I will pay you $10,000 if the price of BTC does not go below $20,000.  But if it does, you pay me $30,000."  So The odds of that happening are statistically low which favors the purchacer of the contract but in the event that crypto-armageddon happens, the seller of the contract has mitigated the loss.
p.s. my numbers are pulled from thin air.  Going for concept here not specific maths.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:53:35
Since there is no requirement to hold bitcoin in order to trade futures, how can it affect the price at all?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:40:03
Wouldn’t call 2 % a hammering
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:05:36
That’s retarded. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:03:17
Woah!!! I meant retarded-incredible!!! Seriously, it’s rediculous how mirror image this is.  It’s a map of the human psyche.

Why is this downvoted 
@_date: 2018-08-20 10:06:38
Yeah I get the idea that he has a lot of shit to show off which implies a high price. But the price ain’t high so what the hell?  Is this a meme that only applies to 2011 hodlers?
@_date: 2018-08-16 12:50:15
Bad title, interesting article

This guy fuckin gets it
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:33:08
This.  They have rule on how they can talk about stocks and such.... but not so with crypto. They can influence much easier
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:53:33
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:33:12
I see a chance that this trend of forking could continue which presents a ceiling on the value and price of any one crypto.  Maybe it's all good because a strongest winner will eventually emerge.... Maybe its bad because it will be perpetual and prevent consumers/merchants from adopting.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:09:30
I think he is just saying that if the community provides more buckets for the public to put their value into it dilutes all buckets' value.  
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:02:32
The value is affected if there is a limited amount of art buyers, and the new students work is of popular demand.   We are talking monetary value, not aesthetic value

Just wait till Wall Street gets their bonuses during Chinese New Year!
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:36:39
By that rationale, the OP would call the exuberance at the last peak the denial of the last crash.  Denial was at 14,000 holmes. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:07:07
Maybe... but no.

@_date: 2017-05-12 21:15:30
@_date: 2017-05-15 11:23:30
Doesn't that mean it becomes less efficient? Or are you saying that as the price rises, this dilution is mitigated?
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:50:41
I thought market cap was the amount of money actually invested into it.   If what you say is true, the metric is almost worthless.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:07:35
For what reason is any religions opinion significant to BTC?
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:11:57
Probably good. Nothing is going to shut down bitcoin so any publicity is only going to have people ask more questions. When the Internet first arrived I remember the negative publicity from pornography and hackers. It took several years for people in general  to except it as a useful and productive tool.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:00:40
I think that's why the question was asked.  We were all noobs at one point
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:46:18
If you don't hold the keys you don't hold the BTC
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:42:43
Your market capitalization would be $100 though.  Ripple has a market cap of $12 billion.  Im not sure I understand your point. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 03:53:19
Is it still "worth it" to mine bitcoin? What about the alts?
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:58:02
I think some are.  Keep in mind I have no affiliation w any hedge fund.  But these guys work with millions of dollars and need to pull things on and off their portfolio at a moments notice.  BTC is not currently liquid in those amounts.   My opinion
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:57:40
OP is saying that he can fraudulently report losses and not report gains. Boasted about not paying taxes for over 30 years
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:29:15
You want to sell for USD?  Gotta go through an American exchange.  Coinbase and Gemini definitely DO report sales.  Believe me or not, I’m just looking out for you.   If you want to just report a loss? Gunna have to prove that shit during an audit.   
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:10:41
Youtube it and watch at least 5 people go through the process of creating a paper wallet.  Each person will give you a few different safety tips.  Watch a few more.  Then make one and test it out with a small amount of BTC.  Try sending and receiving.  Then make a new one and store that thing safely.   Youtube is great for this.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:30:53
But if you report the loss, you’ll have to prove it. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:34:03
So your strategy is not to exit?
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:46:25
Start with small amounts.  Take your time, be very careful copying addresses and verifying you are putting the right address in the right field.  Make mistakes.  The $1.30 transaction fees are your tuition for learning how to do this.  Do not go all in transferring all your holdings on a single transfer.  It's just too easy to make a mistake doing something for the first time.  
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:29:23
I'm talking about a crypto crash. If it happens, how would you exchange crypto for fiat when everyone is trying to do the same thing?
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:06:13
I don’t get it. Sell then buy back within 30 days so you can’t report a loss?  That’s a wash sale. How does that apply as you espouse?
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:24:21
They put the burden on you to figure all that shit out.  Do it incorrectly and you COULD get audited.  Yes it’s probably a hassle for them but they will make examples out of some. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:26:44
Uhhh.... does that mean you convert to fiat or another crypto?
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:50:44
To clarify my question; I am talking about an exit strategy to fiat currency.   If there is a HUGE crash in BTC then yes you could convert to any number of alt coins. But unless you can spend them or convert to fiat, they are relatively useless.  As of now, alt currencies value is relative to BTC.   You could have all the sia or golem on the market but you can't spend them unless you convert to BTC.  So my question is how one would convert to fiat when the exchanges are down like coinbase currently is.   Are there alternative methods (other than coinbase)  to exchange crypto for fiat?
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:37:24
So you also seem like a long term-er.  You don't have an exit strategy is what I'm gathering
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:14:24
Btw, who is trading freakin uranium 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:01:26
Have to sell to report loss
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:21:05
 If the exchange reports your sale to the irs and you don’t report it you are royally fucked.  And with equities, if you sell at a loss and buy back within 30 days, you cannot write off the loss.  Just be careful homie.  Unless you’re dealing with a couple satoshis  you may want to look into your theory.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:40:35
Good luck with all sincerity.  Your testicular fortitude exceeds that of many. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:54:22
No im saying, if you hold BTC on a trezor and trezor.io goes down, would you then be unable to transfer your coin off the trezor?
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:31:00
They announced this?
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:55:14
Not if Coinbase stays down.... heemph
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:12:57
not that I can recall.  But just make sure you do it securely and do some trial runs so you don't make a dumb mistake.  I learned how to do it while watching these videos at the gym, so it's not too incredibly difficult.    Watch several.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:03:22
Yes
