basic misconception. the inflation rate is relatively constant, regulated by difficulty adjustment, and has nothing to do with the "mining arms race".

wronger still

you're the worst kind of wrong

nevermind, you clearly can't even see the linguistics that you're referencing to make these bizarre ideological claims.
consensus is an old word relating to direct democracy, don't conflate it with modern Libertarian problems.
@_date: 2015-08-10 00:37:35
these etymological claims are suspect. source?
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:33:08
well, sure but is making strange, broader ideological claims with etymology as their premise and they're just not true.
"consensus" as in wikipedian consensus is a bizarre concept? what?

the great thing about bitcoin is that all the data anyone has, everyone has. the blockchain (complete transaction record) is public data that all nodes have a copy of, and data is being broadcast to the network all the time about when new blocks are found, and what new transactions have just been "pushed".
Take a look at [this website called "blockchain.info"](

the network has grown in size by many orders of magnitude since satoshi's updates.

you mean, 'incontrovertible'?

except order matters in the realization of these gains -- such everyone forgets amongst the euphoria. bitcoiners will only truly be rich when they stop measuring their profits in dollars...
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:47:03
fundamentals, dude. you must be new here.
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:49:26
price discovery is a long phase. if bitcoin is destined to eat the world's  transaction volume it has to grow from a tiny niche currency to a massive market-cap *somehow*. it is simply undervalued at current prices. what do you expect? once the demand saturates the supply, equilibrium will allow for the stability required to fulfill the original purpose.

So, you're making generalizations about people not relevant to the comment, based on your own misinterpretation of Mittens' actual message, and then continuing an argument about it with someone who probably already agrees with you for the sake of...?

you're confused about 10-20% price swings?
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:28:37
Natural correction to the run-up. Think about this: did you need to point to any particular reason or set of reasons outside of fundamentals to understand "why" it went up in the first place?
Read more about "mean reversion" in price behavior. The answer is simple - price went up too fast and was overvalued at $3000.
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:25:34
simply a minor correction to the prior 3-yr bull market, my friend.
@_date: 2017-06-24 03:52:42
The 3-day period from the evening of the 19th to the evening of the 22nd is the **10th highest volume-traded period** as measured in USD volume in all of bitcoin price history at the Bitfinex exchange.
If you are not at the edge of your seat, you're not paying attention.

great unintended pun here xD

You're way late on the weekend dip theory, and markets move against patterns as traders correct for them en masse. You should study the implications of the efficient market hypothesis and look at autocorrelation rates in historical price data before you lose your shirt.
The short answer is - there are no clear patterns. There are some fuzzy emergent patterns that are constantly traded on, and this activity corrects the patterns.
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:59:29
it's been said before, and yet, bitcoin prices have never retraced significantly below their previous ATH.
i suggest you read about the fundamentals of the currency before you listen to someone who doesn't even know what a whitepaper is.
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:01:31
The market cap is tied to the price, though. So essentially it is just the price movement, and that is a thing that "just happens" in the crypto world as 'weak' hands looking to make a quick buck bail as soon as the bull market ends and 'strong' hands buy the dip.
It's a sign of overfinancialization in the crypto world, which has been a problem since its inception.

Yes because the data that is available to everyone and which everyone more or less (consciously or otherwise) bases their trading decisions on is as utterly useless as tea-leaves.
What do you trade on? Gut feeling?
