I could have just as easily made millions of dollars.  If I had, no one would say I was gambling, they would be asking me how I did it.  My reasoning is sound, how is it not?

But none of those investments are going to get me my money back.  What is the average return of a "safe" investment?  1%?  2%?  That isn't enough.  Bitcoin IS safe, I was just unlucky. 
A bank financial adviser is going to be opposed to Bitcoin investments.  I already tried to do that.  They suggested I place it into bonds, etc that have single digit returns.  That is ridiculous.

That woman is a counselor.  She probably has a B.A. in psychology and thinks she knows everything.  Most importantly, what she doesn't know, is me.  I am not a gambler and never have been.  I have been operating businesses since I was a teenager.  I know a lot about money but trading is something new for me.  I need advice on how to trade properly.

I tried to do this.  They responded negatively to my desire to invest in Bitcoin.  I paid them well for their awful advice too.  Do you have any recommendations of how to find a financial adviser that actually understands what Bitcoin is?

Around $1.25 Million.  The individuals helping me liquidate everything screwed me.  I hired people from out of the town my family lives in because there weren't many people I would consider to be competent at handling the task there.  I massively undersold some of the assets to their cronies.

She agreed to my investing.  So, no, if anything she only rightfully possesses half of the left over money.  It was her investment too.  I didn't blow anything, I am just in a rough patch.
I didn't make this thread to get beat up on.  I am looking for help.

That won't happen.  The house hasn't been sold and can always be lived in.  The maintenance fees are minimal, property taxes are low, etc.
The *worst* thing that will happen to her is that her college education will have to be partially paid for in debt.  I didn't run anything for her and I wish people would stop treating me like I did.  She will always have half of the house, no matter what.  If I have to stop living in NYC i will be moving back there.  It isn't being sold.  
It is just money.  It comes and goes.  I am not going to lose my sister, if that is what you are implying.  She knows it is risky.  I can't tell her though.  She reads Bitcoin news and sees the gains and thinks we are benefiting from it.  At one point during extreme volatility she became concerned and I lied to her telling her that I nearly doubled the money.  As long as I get back the original amount everything will be okay.

It is $130K not $150K.  *If I get down to $150K* I will stop, is what I said.  I am going to trade differently this time and am looking for advice on how to do that...
Instead of berating me people could help me
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:02:55
I would do that if I could but I CAN'T.  I "technically" owe my sister $375,000.  I only have near to $280,000 left.  If I split that with her then I will only have $140,000 for myself left.  That isn't enough.  She might be mad too.  
I know I can do this and I wish people would help me instead of tearing into me.  I am not the first person to make a mistake like this and I have never seen this community treat people like this before.
The only other thing that there is, is the house.  I could probably take a mortgage out on the house if I absolutely had to.  It is located in Ward, NY.  The housing market isn't absolutely wonderful there though so I don't know how that works.  It is a very small town, everyone knows everyone, kind of thing. 
My family is pretty involved in the town government and I am afraid if people find out, as in if I tell my sister, that it will harm them somehow.  It is a very gossipy type of place.

She agreed to me investing it, so how would that be fair?  She is about to enter college in a STEM field and will be capable of financial success anyway.  It isn't like she is going to end up on the street, but I might.  If I gave it all to her, I wouldn't have any money to live off of.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:07:37
I already said that I would stop if I hit $150K.  That isn't going to happen.  If it does, which it won't, I will split that with my sister.  I didn't blow her share, she agreed to the investing.  She is fine and it isn't dickish.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:57:32
The only person aware of that agreement is my father and I.  She isn't even aware that he told me that.  I just told her "...and half will be yours."  I never spoke to her about the reason half was hers.  All the paperwork leads to me.  The verbal contract is heresay.

I didn't and don't really consider what I am doing to be gambling.  I am investing/day trading. It isn't like I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on scratch off tickets.  I was just unlucky in some of my trades.  
I am not looking for "magic bullet" advice.  I am looking for proven strategies that have been shown to work.  I know there are no guarantees.  I REALLY need to make this money back though.  I have decided that if I get down to $150,000 that I will stop.  So I basically have $130,000 left to invest.  I know it won't come down to that though.
By stopping there, my sister and I can split $75,000 and be able to survive for awhile since we don't have any parental assistance any longer.  That will help her pay for another two years of school.  She'll only have to acquire a little bit of debt to finish then.

I can't do that now.  I need to earn the money back.  If I could do that, and still be okay, I would.  I need to day trade an perform arbitrage or I will not be able to recoup my losses.
Help me find a good adviser and I will see one.  I have looked all over NYC and there none of the advisers understand what Bitcoin is. Every single one I have called has told me that they wouldn't ever advise me to put any of my money into it.  There reasons were all stupid.  They don't "get" it. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:50:39
I am not currently in a rural area.  I moved to Brooklyn, NYC once I received the inheritance because I could afford to live where I wanted at that point.
The financial adviser I visited was based here.  I called a few financial advisers after my bad experience and tried to find someone that would be willing to help me trade Bitcoin but I couldn't find anyone.  Some of the advisers were complete dicks about it too.
1% is only $2800 at this point.  I can't make my money back quickly enough doing that.  I technically have four years until my sister turns 21 to get all of the money back.  My living expenses alone would outpace the gains.
I appreciate your advice but I don't know how to utilize it and meet my goals.
