Unless of course you're working with a co conspirator who can make up the remaining hash rate you're missing.
If I have 47 percent of the total hashrate it isn't hard to find someone with 4 percent to help me.
Looking at single pools and pointing out that they're almost at 50 is a little silly when two pools with 30 is just as good.

Oh Bitcoin can be made illegal, that line, that single line, shows your utter, embarrassing, delusion.
You need to take a step back from something you're so invested in, financially and emotionally, and use some rational eyes for a moment.  I'm not saying it will necessarily ever be made illegal.  But the line that it cannot be made illegal is completely insane and completely idiotic.

Thankfully someone in this subreddit knows what they are talking about. Unfortunately, above us, people are trying to rationalize how rampant speculation is good for a market.  They just have a book of financial terms and spout it as if they have some knowledge.  Speculators clear the market and provide liquidity? Yeah I guess that's technically correct but it leaves out the part where they dump it all and cause a huge glut, crashing the market.
You will never have a currency worth anything if its value is derived primarily from speculation.  Its too volatile for daily use.
A good way to put it is like this: Would you be fine if your employer paid you in BTC? The intelligent answer is no, especially at current prices.  Its too shaky and too volatile to use outside of a few purchases, or for trading.

But what if it does.  You can't make your decisions like this.  That money, you don't have much, would be better spent in a savings account. Then, once you've got enough rainy day money, you can start looking at investments.
I know you keep saying this isn't an investment, but it is, and I feel you're going to come out the other side of this really depressed about how much you lose.  I don't want that.

Ding Ding Ding. The instant businesses can't immediately cash out of bitcoins into fiat is the instant they stop accepting bitcoins. If they're made illegal, that's exactly what happens. Even the small fractions of fractions of a percent that currently accept it will stop.

Wow, holy shit dude.  This will be my last response.
First, nothing is unenforceable, it's all about willingness to enforce.
Second, the fact that drug prices go up, and you using that as an example, shows how little of this you really get.  Drugs have a purpose outside of a means of exchange.  Drugs have values for their recreational and addictive usages.  People will pay for them for those reasons. Bitcoins only exist for their ability to exchange for goods or money.  If they lose that, they lose everything.
Bitcoins can easily be destroyed, they're effectively destroyed every day by people who lose their hard disks.  Deleting pertinent files effecitvely destroys the bitcoins and makes them unrecoverable.
Your point about richard branson and coffee machines shows how little you're following the conversation.  I was speaking to a hypothetical situation where bitcoins were banned.  Lol, you think if they're banned, Richard Branson is going to accept them?
Finally, you're misunderstanding what is required to destroy bitcoin.  It doesn't need to be shut down totally to be EFFECTIVELY destroyed.  If the US and most of Europe banned it for whatever reason, it would be done, over with.  It would still exist, yes.  And some hashing power  would still exist, yes.  But its use as a medium of exchange would disappear entirely.  It would once again be relegated to the depths of silk road and similar ventures.
Which, in my book, is the death of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:06:34
Local bitcoins is not a decentralized solution. You rely entirely on local bitcoins... Without it you would have to find a similar website or group... But they won't exist if it's banned. So now what? Now how do you sell with your decentralized solution?

If everyone held like you, you realize your coins would have no value, as the buyers and sellers are what determine the market price.

That doesn't change that the buyers and sellers are the ones who determine the price.

The idea that the fundamentals are solid is, honestly, just being completely dishonest with yourself.  Everyone here knows and can see what kind of people use bitcoin.  People do not buy and sell with it.  People invest in it.  It's an investment for almost every one of you.  For everyone who buys and sells with it there's a few miners and a ton of people holding what they have.  Why?  Deflation.  I know you all tout it like its some kind of messiah.  Deflation so good, changes behaviors, etc...
But the truth is, and you know it, you absolutely know it...anyone who believes in this currency knows it has to go up to 500, 1k, 10k, 100k to be viable on a large scale.  Those same people would be stupid to spend it today, if they genuinely believe that, they're missing out on 10x-100x their money.  We applaud and are so happy for those who got in early, look at them!  Millionaires!  But what did they do...They weren't contributing to a bitcoin economy...they were speculators who are selling to more speculators.  They just happened to be right.
No, I know, most of you hold to a belief in the best parts of bitcoin, and handle the rest with some fairly dishonest doublethink.  You tout its best parts and then keep your dirty little secret: That you, too, are hoarding coins.  If you're not, then you're profit taking the whole way up and selling to those who are willing to hoard it.  Either way, you aren't spending them.  There's nowhere to spend them.  That's why it makes it to the top of the subreddit each time someone does decide to take them.  Look!  Validity!  Yes!  Look at how we are validated, today is great!  
Meanwhile, you know that you only want to hold it.  Tomorrow it could be 200-250-300....one thousand.  You'd be stupid to sell now...But even when you do..you know you're gonna sell it on Mt Gox or another exchange..you aren't giving it to a merchant.  
Anyway.  I know, i know.  Someone, maybe multiple people will come by: "No, not me!" They'll say "I spent X coins at Y place on Z day!"  Look at how successful bitcoin is.  And I'll let that speak for itself.
Almost no one accepts bitcoins except other speculators.  You all know the fundamentals are weak at best.  Enjoy the ride, work toward the end goal of acceptance...But don't delude yourself with these lies.  The number one threat to bitcoin is its deflationary trend.  Forever, it will be worth more to hold it, than to use it.  There's a reason every economy embraces slight inflation.  
The number one threat to bitcoin is greed.
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:09:29
Bitcoin is only information to an idealist. To everyone else its money, or its an investment.
Either way. This post is embarrassing. I could go fins any graph with an upward trend and go "Look. Not a bubble." Is that valid? Of course not.  There is nothing...nothing to compare between bitcoin and information.
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:46:28
You make a pretty bold claim with no basis or proof, or even simple reasoning given.

@_date: 2013-12-17 17:17:21
You pass a law making it illegal?  
"Cryptocurrencies are banned from use or ownership.  Possession, distribution, or activities related to 'mining' crypotcurrencies will result in X years in prison"
Done.  Store cards, coupons, everything is still valid.  Bitcoin is now illegal, it's done. On top of it, for the few that still cling to it, there is no way for the network to check your transactions.  The few that run their GPU on the network do so in constant fear of being caught at a loss to themselves due to the worthlessness of the currency.  People trade it only on the deep web, and even then, fear of undercover agents limits even that.  Thousands of bitcoins buy you the smallest amount of drugs, and you can essentially only buy drugs with them because anyone using them for a legitimate purpose would rather accept money.
My anger doesn't exist, I'm not angry with you, I'm calling you blind.    You're blinded.  Wherever you go from here, whatever you choose to invest or hold, however well you've done in the past with bitcoins, you need to examine your beliefs.  They're flawed.

Perhaps an easier way to phrase it would be to say this: On a small, or relatively small, electronics purchase, yes, you can say...I want this phone now, I will buy it, a new phone will be out in a few months but this is a fine phone.
While the same rationale can occur with larger purchases, cars, houses, etc, they also tend to be much more important purchases that require much more devotion.  A phone, if it was the wrong purchase, is a few hundred dollars over a couple years.  A house is a few hundred thousand over 10-20-30 years.
So, presented with this scenario:
I have a phone I'm willing to sell you.  You can buy it today, for 200, but next week it MIGHT be on sale for 20% off.  30% chance.  What do you do?  Do you wait to save the 60 dollars?  Or do you just go ahead and buy, because it could otherwise be weeks before you get it (the phone isn't getting any better).
I have a house I will sell you for 200,000 dollars.  You can buy it today for that price, but next month, it MIGHT be on sale 20% off.  30% chance.
Now what do you do?  The phone is a minor purchase on a quickly aging technology.  You just don't have that week to wait in many cases.  Plus, I mean, it's only 40 bucks I'm losing out on, no big deal.
House on the other hand is a purchase you're stuck with, for years.  Waiting a month on something that isn't aging almost at all in exchange for a potential 40,000 dollars?  Yes please.  Worst case, I wait a month, it doesn't drop, and I buy it anyway, and it's essentially the same house in the same condition.  
The problem is, next month, the same conditions are presented to me.  People do and will put off buying.  This can be seen in US homebuying and prices currently.  Loans are more scarce, yes, but many people were afraid that the house they would buy would be worth 20-30-50% less than that paid for it, very quickly...And this put off a lot of buyers.
Deflation is bad.  Specifically unpredictable deflation.

Man.  You need to rethink where you are learning economics and finance. 
No market has ever behaved that way. Do stocks behave that way?  You're assuming that people hold onto the coins after the price stabilizes, which is of course wrong.   The instant people get the idea that it's going down and not coming back,  it will crash.   All the way,  it will crash,  everyone will sell in a panic trying to get what they can from it. 
I mean... You're just wrong.   You linked a Wikipedia article about demand and then starting arguing semantics. You don't even know how to use the phrase straw man. 
The guy you're speaking to is absolutely right. His proof is every bubble ever.

You are one of a few hundred. Your anecdote changes and proves nothing. You're the one misguiding people. You've taken a currency and turned it into a ideal. You're buying an ideal.

That's a pretty easy claim to make in hindsight.  The problem is: what if bit coin didn't go up? Thing about investments is they often don't work out.   The only reason this one turned in out ok was because bitcoins soared in value,  something that was by no means guaranteed. 
The reason people say that it is better to pay the debts first is because it dramatically reduces the risk of investing because you aren't so dependent on the next bit of income to make payments. 
If you're investing into things with no guaranteed returns, hell not even a precedent for returns, before paying off your debts,  in many cases it speaks to a lack of responsibility. 
EDIT:  I apparently replied to the wrong guy here.

That's common knowledge and prevailing wisdom.  The proof is in the previous bitcoin crash and the one that is coming in time. The proof is in everyone's actions here. The proof is when someone becomes bitcoin rich and is voted to the top, even though all they did was sell it to other people who hope to become bitcoin rich.  
You're making the claim that goes against almost every economy, economist,  and common sense.   You post proof of your claims. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:18:43
The point is that no one is doing that. A million dollars worth of bit coins are what drove the price up overnight...think he just wanted to buy a house with them? The vast majority of people on this subreddit see it as an investment and nothing more.  People outside this subreddit almost unanimously see it as an investment.
No one is spending it.
