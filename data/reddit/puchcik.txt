I agree, if they cannot say who stole the funds than they are responsible for missing funds! if not a full criminal investigation is needed before any liquidation/restructuring. If not this whole legal approach is a farce.

waiting for same answers here
additionally I hear that Jeb has a massive personal BTC stash - perhaps some of it from MtGox codl wallets? who knows
is this why he does not want us to find out what happened at mtgox?
@_date: 2014-05-21 19:06:53
same here, I want to know what happened, these legal class action settlements have not satisfied my idea of justice at all, and why karpeles is not in a home arrest until this matter is resolved is beyond me, information for japan court system is terrible, at least sunlot guys are saying what they will do; overall in the age of informaiton i feel increadibly underiformed what happened to my money, i suspect an act of vigilante justice to karpeles is getting stronger if this state of affairs persist
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:25:08
what can we do?
I added my support to mtgoxrecovery and to savegox
foremost I believe that the matter should be investigate before any liquidation or restart is attempted
I am not sure how the courts can just say we are liquidating without investigating first - where is elementary justice in it? I have to say I had better opinion about Japan but perhaps it was not justified at all. I think the meeting in july is very important. we should be able to have input through internet to this meeting - in fact it should be a videoconference to which you log in with your mt gox login. Is it too much to aks in the 21st century? Perhaps skype could help a bit or some othe rplatform by arranging this video link and chat room; my 2 cents of what I have left

i guess next time somebody changes electronic input in your bank account we can say you are a loser too, pension gone - oops looser, visa account compromised - oops looser again, etc. man - we are living in digital age now, property extends into digital sphere too, you must be a moron

i want to see a formal investigation
so the coins are stolen - where are the thieves?
if not stolen - Mark needs to explain what happened?
nothing like this should happen before it is known how the lost coins "disappeared"
first order of business is to establish what happened an not what to do now, i think we deserve the truth here first

he will not come to testify on his own, he is a coward which he already showed by avoiding bankruptcy proceedings; in the end this little pathetic jerk just acted in his best interested throwing us under the bus, I think reciprocity should be our policy toward this dick and if we can allign with sunlot and have Debauchery and others testify against him and put him in a dark cell for many years that should serve him well
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:00:31
same here, i think rehabilitation without a complete restoration of balances is not acceptable
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:35:00
SPOT ON
IF FUNDS ALL ARE NOT RETURNED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS A MUST
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:09:48
tell it to Madoff victims, or to Enron shareholders

Ok, I understand there is no criminal proceeding, but if you are walking away after your company owes hundreds of millions of dollars, after you "find" some money in old wallet and after you for not want to show to answer questions before USA court I am of the opinion that you are guilty until proven innocent - otherwise it is a farce not justice system, imagine Madoof walking away after reporting that he does not know where the $ is, but perhaps this NJ governor is a good example - hard to believe this guy is free and not rotting in a sand somewhere. Conclusion: steal 1000 bucks you pay fine/go to jail, steal 100000000 and you are free 
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:21:05
you are probably right Peter
what kind of a deal is this settlement before we even know what the hell happened, and why settle with McCaleb and Gay-Bouchery right away - they are insiders on this
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:40:41
good one
@_date: 2014-03-15 16:33:30
I signed up with them too yesterday; did they send you an email or some sort of confirmation? 
@_date: 2014-10-10 16:46:09
so here is my dig at you Mr. Karpeles - we found out that you lend your customer money - to your other companies. How is that legal? Is this why perhaps I could not withdraw my funds for over a year? I suggest you watch what you say cause there are a lot of people here who do not appreciate your standoffish responses behind the computer screen. Wish you had some balls man and admit to your crimes. Thanks for ruining many people financially with your lack of diligence. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 03:15:33
well i signed up, let's see what happens
I guess it cannot get any worse now so let's see what these guys will come up with
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:50:09
just wait
my gut feeling tells me he will suffer a mysterious accident soon
i have a feeling the secret site will pop with quick funding for an undisclosed bitcoin project that includes removal of certain "bugs" from the system
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:16:32
no source, but it does not seem right that people that are insiders now get to be responsible for recovery effort! wtf?
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:42:17
time to start a private pool perhaps with hiring professional ninjas and delivering justice a la Karpeles style: "Sorry for inconvenience, but Karpeles and his bitcoins are temporarily unavailable". Kobayahsi can later sell his cats.

same here, if 100% is not paid back I will sue, why not? i want to see MK answering all the questions which we know he is afraid of, so why not use it so he can finally "remember" where the rest of the coins is...or start working on butthole plugs for a warmup before being a jail milf:)
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:18:56
I agree with the fact that settling with McCaleb and Gay-Bouchery is premature - they are insiders after all and now they are investigating themselves?  laughable
@_date: 2014-04-25 19:49:42
thanks Oliver!

1 -Does Japanese bankruptcy proceeding have priority over other class action suits?
2 - Say Japanese authorities decide that Mt.Gox is bankrupt and is criminally liable for losses - what next? do we need to sue them separately or will we all be bundled into one law suit?
3 - is there a point in joining other legal action like a class action suit at this moment?
4 - what about all the evidence proivded by hackers including databases, trading history etc. - it al lpoints out to M. Karpeles loosing BTC in bad trades -  
Will it be a valid proof in court? 
5 - do they have capacity to understand the nature of bitcoin and related crime?
6 - bitcoin is an asset that has its value even though it is exchanged into dollars - how do you suppose they can return bitcoins? would the court force them to repurchase them on the market?
7 - also if dollar value per bitcoin is discussed which value would that be - current value on a different exchange or the last value on mt gox?
8 - can we get full disclosure form Kapreles on his business and private holdings of bitoins and other assets?
9 - if he is liable in multiple jurisdiction - which one ges the priority?
10 - what is the potential penalty - in prison years - if he is found liable for fraud and/or negligence?
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:04:57
whether you like it or not something will replace mt gox anyways
there will be an exchange with say 50 to 80% bitcoin trades in a year or two
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:18:56
I come here and other sites as well, what we need is a bitcoin foundation to start acting as a leader and fighter for us not just promoting high bitcoin prices, they are useless
@_date: 2014-04-24 23:24:09
definately worht a shot, but according to japanese bankruptcy path the next step is liquidation so I do not know how this would be possible
and how did karpeles fucked it up again this time by giving up so unbelievable - somebody should provide some bitcoin vigilante justice i guess
