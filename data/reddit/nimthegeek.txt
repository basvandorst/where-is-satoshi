In the Uk when I buy something with my debit card or credit card (and pay it off straight away) I pay no fees on £ - in fact quite the opposite. If I leave a positive balance in my account -  I earn interest.

Thanks a lot for this, I have just signed up for an account, that is a lot easier. Do you have any thoughts on my app idea though, it could be even simpler than localbitcoins. Can be done straight away.

 I had an idea for this, basically an app that costs $20 and gives you that much bitcoin immediately.

maybe a quick verification could solve this, such as by taking a photo of your id
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:15:24
but you kind of can with some of the new start-up tech solutions, in the UK some banks are coming out with e-mail solutions like Pingit

Again totally sympathise with the political view and the benefits - but how does that benefit me Joe Public?

I'm sorry to come across so - selfish, I do sympathise with these problems in the world.
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:14:31
Exactly, there seems to be a wealth of reasons to do it for social and political reasons, but are there any benefits from just a utility perspective (apart from if I need it to buy something anonymously - which I assume would be for mostly shady materials). Apologies for coming across selfishly, I can obviously emphasize with the reasons for de-centralising banking, but just wanted to see if there were some solid utilities.

cool idea...i think all the infrastructure is out there in some form its just putting the building blocks together
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:58:01
cool, quick question why did you chose golang as the language of choice, were there some existing libraries already out there that you used?
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:18:56
yes, I can see that as well, but then can't you just buy gold instead?

Im just generally interested in the theme of crowd sourced investment and trading decision making, not sure of the actual details as of yet...hopefully these will become clearer in time.

hi alistair, that sounds like a great starting point, I was thinking there must be loads of arbitrage opportunities, as long as the exchanges can guarantee execution as a certain price. I'll send you a PM.
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:22:36
yer, I'm not sure how well it would perform, there a plenty of reasons why it would probably end up losing money very quickly...but could be a cool social experiment.
Was planning for all the prototype proceeds to go to charity and then for a second version "voters" to share the profits having paid something into the pot. This should stop trolls, if they are having to put their own money up before voting..
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:56:21
yer it would take some thinking about what time interval it should work on... could go shorter or potentially even longer, becomes less like trading and more like investment management...
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:57:38
sounds great, will take a look!
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:53:34
i should know that...how embaressing
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:57:15
yer doing it on futures sounds like a really good idea, the leverage would definitely make it more exciting!
@_date: 2015-04-07 10:36:37
General first prototype:
Have a trading account funded with a small amount e.g. $1,000.
Build a platform with three buttons buy, sell and hold, along with a slider to select an amount. 
Execute trades at the end of a time interval (e.g. every hour).
If the prototype takes off, I can explore building a larger platform where anyone who participates in voting has to invest a small amount (e.g. $100) and then will be able to take their share of the profits.

this is a great idea, could help detect crime in the bitcoin network. I guess though from an actual implementation perspective it would be difficult to get such training data.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:14:14
yer your right, probably should keep it to twitch, just think that there are some good pivots in case twitch wont like it
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:16:17
i guess, though maybe it will be a slightly different audience. I was thinking could increase engagement, by allowing people to post a comment or content with their "vote". Will kind of get a debate going and content generated kind of like reddit.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:27:02
yeah - you definitely raise points that need to be thought about and ironed out
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:58:39
tbh could potentially do it off reddit rather than twitch, or make a similar platform to do it on as well!
