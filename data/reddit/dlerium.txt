From logging into both BitGo and Coinbase, I see you can change the withdrawal limits yourself. That's an inherent weakness in the system. The alternative is to hard-enforce those limits and make them unchangeable, but that would be impractical given how Bitcoin's own price has changed so much. There's no one to manually review your settings when you change them at any site. 
**Edit:** Not saying that BitGo doesn't have room to improve--in fact I'd argue every site could use improvements, but I'd hardly say they have a big role in this. Bitfinex is the main source of failure. Who do you blame when my Coinbase or BitGo password is stolen and someone can login to empty my accounts?
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:39:56
BitGo's service besides their wallet is their [Platform API]( I don't understand it fully but it does say it's based on the same principles as its multi-sig wallet. Their 2-of-3 wallet for consumers is pretty easy to grasp.




That's just marketing speak. Yes there's tangible benefits to using a 2-of-3 setup. Compared to a standard Coinbase wallet where they could run away with your funds, the 2-of-3 adds the benefit of not having that risk. Also you have the benefit of if BitGo goes away, since you control 2 keys, you can always extract your funds.
Virtually hack proof is simply marketing speak. It's important to recognize the benefits of 2-of-3 but also recognize its limitations. One of your keys is your wallet password in 2-of-3 on BitGo. If that's compromised, just like if your Coinbase password is compromised, your funds are gone. Certainly there's 2FA, but essentially, what I'm trying to describe is if a key is compromised. In that case you're just as screwed as in a 1-of-1 situation.


The fraud protection on the wallet seems to be transfer limitations and daily spend limits. I'd imagine those are adjustable, but probably require a 2nd factor confirmation or a delayed change. After all BTC prices continue to fluctuate, so you can't imagine someone setting a hard limit of 100 BTC/day back in 2012 would still want the same limit today.
I agree we still need a full investigation of what went on, but my point initially was just to point out that 2-of-3 security where BitGo controls 1 key still has limitations. It's not really BitGo's fault that 2-of-3 has such limitations, but it's really the user's responsibility to understand this when deciding on a secure solution.

That's a good point but most average people are not affected. If you're embracing thug culture and driving a beat up car leaving a trail of marijuana scent behind and regularly carry $500+ in cash on you then perhaps you do want to be careful and think about using Bitcoin instead.
If you're a tech worker that commutes on the Google bus and are highly invested in tech and have accounts on PayPal, Venmo, Google Wallet, Apple Pay, etc then no Bitcoin probably doesn't serve an immediate need for you.

Their vault is still essentially a 1-of-1 wallet with more features such as withdrawal delays, multi user confirmation, etc. It still just takes one weakness in cold storage to make your funds go down the drain. With that said they've done a lot for the Bitcoin world.
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:47:15
Doesn't Coinbase usually hold onto 1 key making it behave similar to a 1-of-1 wallet where you login and make transactions? Or is this different with a group vault?
My understanding with 2-of-3 on Coinbase is 99% of the time I just login and if I want to move my funds around that's fine because Coinbase signs the 2nd key based on what I tell it to do. However if Coinbase ever decides to fold or die or disappear like MtGox, I can still use their recovery tool to recover my funds.
My question is it sounds like you're using the recovery tool, but why not do it the normal way? I guess a group vault is different?
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:45:20
It doesn't say money under the mattress is illegal. It's just in general not normal to have $100k stashed there. If you deposited it then you wouldn't have any issues. It's natural for brokers to want to avoid pure cash transactions for fear of counterfeit cash.

Have you seen real press conferences? Say ones after public events like the Orlando shooting? The officials only comment on things they have 100% confirmed. If there's anything still working, they use cover-your-ass language. Sounds like any company's PR.
A CEO isn't going to be 100% transparent either. And that's just how things work. I get it that people are upset, but sometimes if we act too quickly and rashly without working out the details, you can dig yourself into a deeper hole.
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:49:48
Not sure what you're trying to say. I personally don't think you should get in trouble for carrying $500 in cash but at the same time if you live in a relatively large city in the US there's hardly any reason to carry that kind of cash unless you somehow cannot carry credit.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:40:15


Well that's because money you put in Bitfinex is in turn stored by Bitgo, meaning there's a middleman. So what you're protecting against isn't Bitfinex running off with your money, it's protection against Bitgo. Essentially you can imagine the scenario as you yourself using Bitgo. Sure Bitgo can't take your money, but if I steal your password just like I could've stolen your Gox password, your money is gone. Bitgo doesn't protect against that.
The importance is to understand what 2-of-3 security really provides you when one of the keys is held by the "bank."


Bitgo's security is that they cannot run away with the funds. That's all there is.


What safeguards do you propose? Like a withdrawal limit? But what if hypothetically all Bitfinex customers wanted to cash out tomorrow, would you now blame Bitgo for having a withdrawal limit?
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:13:41
Fair question--it sounds like if you want control of your funds you should control your private keys. Not sure why people keep blaming Coinbase when they've been one of the top tier exchanges out there.

@_date: 2016-08-03 18:00:19


Most of the problems were due to user error:
- Poor password choice
- Reuse of passwords
- Emailing backups (I admit Blockchain should've turned this off by default), but email security is still paramount.
- No 2FA (even this shouldn't be an issue if you chose a strong password to begin with)
@_date: 2016-08-31 06:48:51
Run it offline on a separate computer is the best. IT knowledge varies from person to person but if you're willing to bet you don't have some malware or keylogger on your system then you should be fine running it on your main computer.
I have yet to hear of anyone's passwords compromised by a keylogger. 99% of password failures are due to shitty password choice to begin with or sites getting hacked and password reuse being found.
@_date: 2016-08-12 22:13:28
Well how can we rally against Coinbase if all we have is a biased account? Most user complaints are going to be biased and don't fairly assess what they did wrong.
Go look at Yelp for instance--how many negative reviews about service can you find? Millions. How many of them start off like "we were only 5 minutes late because we were parking..." Sounds like a biased complaint without taking responsibility for their actions.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:39:08
BitGo isn't a security guard. You're making false equivalences here. Once again, it's important to understand what a 2-of-3 wallet actually provides you and protects you against and its limitations.
People somehow act like an advertisement of security means you're 100% safe. A security guard doesn't protect you from yourself either. You can live in a fortress with guard towers and still be an idiot and electrocute yourself in your own home because you don't know not to use a hair dryer in the bathtub.
2-of-3 security where 1 key is held by the service provider is meant to be similar to 1-of-1. It's meant to give you the ease of being able to log in and quickly spend while ensuring the provider can't run off. If you wanted better and more secure 2-of-3, then you should've setup a more complex system where you hold all 3 keys.
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:11:57


The problem is it's encrypted with your credentials where Google holds those keys. If you're all about zero knowledge backups, Google Drive backups are a huge loss in security.

That's ONE aspect about it, which is fair, but I'm pointing out the advantage and disadvantage of controlling keys which is even more important. 
You can buy and sell all you want and get a discount off Circle, but when your funds are trapped and you ahve no way to recover them, then you recognize the benefit of controlling your own keys. Coinbase isn't perfect, but its' 2-of-3 solution allows you to control the funds and they can't run away.
Thank you for downvoting me without having a civil discussion.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:45:05
So your internet was shit and it failed to sync? I agree the system could be better, but this is a risk with any Javascript application in your browser.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:52:53


I'm saying this based on what we know about Bitgo's 2-of-3 security from their website. If you just compare that to a typical 1-of-1 like Coinbase, it makes sense. What you remove is the ability for Bitgo to steal your money and the ability for you to control the funds fully because you have 2 out of 3 keys.
So yes, there's assumption that this model is applied to Bitfinex, and I suspect that even if it's somewhat modified in that no one in Bitfinex has to actually "log in" to the Bitfinex Bitgo account, the system still works similarly even if the keys are used in a more sophisticated manner via APIs and what not.
My point is that if the multisig system in Bitgo used by Bitfinex is the one we understand it to be, then all an attacker really needs to do is obtain 1 of the keys that Bitfinex has. BitGo itself is not really the problem. That's why in my previous post I brought up comparing a BitGo account to Gox. Assuming Gox was still around... or heck let's just use Coinbase instead as they're more relate-able, my point is that if someone gets your key/password, they get the funds because they can just log right in. Similarly if someone gets your password/key for BitGo, then they log into BitGo and they get your funds too. Multi-sig when one of the keys will do whatever you want it to do, doesn't really buy you extra security if your password is compromised.
Now back to Bitfinex, I imagine it's not as simple as someone having a Bitfinex login and it's done through an API and what not, but the model probably still applies--if someone gets the Bitfinex keys, the money could be moved easily.


True, but I don't think we know how the system is really setup.
@_date: 2016-08-19 23:07:50
No offense but you're the one who came in here with a sarcastic remark when I was trying to say that carrying cash is in general a low risk activity for most people. Now obviously one should evaluate how they do it. Do they live in a sketch neighborhood like Rio where you should carry a 2nd wallet for muggings? Are they dressed like a drug dealer and are notoriously bad drivers who would probably get pulled over all the time and misidentified as a drug dealer? Those are certainly things to consider.
However, my point is that for people who are savvy enough to use payment systems at least in the US like PayPal or Venmo, then there really is very little need for them to switch to Bitcoin.
I'd also say that while this is anecdotal, amongst most of my friends (we are engineers), we collectively pretty much use only credit cards except when we have to use cash. There really is no reason not to like I said unless you have poor credit or are irresponsible with carrying a line of credit.

No he talked about this on another thread. Basically his internet failed to sync the wallet and now contends it's a Blockchain.info issue. He closed the client before it was sync and when he opened it back up, the changes were gone.
It's clear the transaction went through but the wallet didn't sync up and he lost his funds. Now whether or not this was a widespread problem that affected everyone else (I doubt it), or was a single case we can't be certain. But I'd be careful pinning one user's issues on the provider. People will blame anyone and everyone for their issues.

That's how it would work for a single user wallet. Obviously Bitfinex doesn't manually process transactions where someone sits there and logs in to BitGo as Bitfinex and then processes transactions. That's why BitGo offers APIs. Rather than to look at the details of 2FA and confirmations and stuff, think of 2-of-3 from a high level view. 1 key is held by BitGo, and the other 2 are by Bitfinex. All you need to do is take control of 1 of the 2 keys Bitfinex has. The key BitGo has will do whatever you want it to do. The details of 2FA and what not are minor at that point.

Correct. I have a multisig vault. You are told to enter a key that is NOT your password as part of the setup.
Theoretically you could do it all through 1 password (think how Tutanota does it versus Protonmail), but yeah it's probably safer to decouple them.
Either way if the shared key is properly set up and encrypted with a strong enough password it shouldn't be an issue that Coinbase holds onto it.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:52:58
Blockchain.info is fine if you know what you're doing. Most losses were the result of user error and poor password choices.

It's simple like a wallet service like traditional Coinbase, MtGox or Circle, except your service can't run off with your funds.
99% of the time you just login and move your funds. You sign the first key, the provider signs the second key, and you can do whatever you want. In the event Coinbase disappears, you can recover your funds supposedly with the 3rd backup key that you store underneath your mattress.
To me that's actually a huge benefit. It's the convenience of PayPal but your money is yours.

From a personal finance perspective there is no reason to avoid credit cards unless you yourself cannot manage credit. I suspect many of the users here could benefit from some personal finance classes (is a good start). With that said yes, there are times I do have to pay cash like at cash-only restaurants.
You are completely incorrect that you aren't allowed to buy anything $400 or $500 or more. While civil asset forfeiture is a real thing, it doesn't affect most people. If you read most of the news stories, they typically begin with someone being pulled over for a driving violation, and then the cops find something suspicious like obvious drug or alcohol smell leading to a search. And let's be totally honest, most DUI stops don't even result in a vehicle strip down search. Really it's when the worst cases all fall
I'm not saying to avoid Bitcoin, no people should adopt it, but to act like somehow life is unliveable because cash is so high risk is absolutely absurd. There's over $1 trillion in cash in circulation per the Federal Reserve. My point is for most Americans savvy enough to use Bitcoin, they probably are also saavy enough to be using financial services like Venmo and PayPal with little issue.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:01:34
The point is in 2-of-3, BitGo holds one of the keys, so all you need to do is get your hands on another key, which the attacker clearly did.
Those additional security measures at BitGo are useless--Coinbase has those for 1-of-1 wallets too (their Vault storage). If someone gets ahold of your key on Coinbase, much like BitGo, your funds are drained. BitGo will do whatever you want it to do with the second key. Maybe those secondary measures could've saved some funds, but people need to understand how 2-of-3 works.

There are pluses and minuses and it depends on your threat model. Are you just trying to avoid your ISP looking at what you're doing or protecting your data when you work at a coffee shop? Do you just want fast speeds so you can download away as a US user? Sure then PIA works fine. If you're looking to avoid 3 letter agencies or you're wanted by US authorities, then you probably don't want to be using them.
However let's get away from the notion that non-US is somehow magically safe. Here's why:
1. Nothing prevents the US government from asking another government for help. How many governments do you trust to protect you from the US? Snowden was a high profile target and Russia/China obviously did nothing to stick it to us. If he was lower profile, you can bet a CIA team would've extracted him already. If the target was a global enemy like Osama Bin Laden, every country would've handed him over if not flat out executed him already. Remember the Silk Road guy? Yeah, the FBI marched in and Iceland cooperated.
2. PRISM and other NSA surveillance was designed against foreign targets. US citizens have constitutional rights in theory at least. If your data is going outside of the US, you can guarantee it will be monitored and can be monitored completely legally.

Why are they at fault? I'm genuinely curious and I don't understand all the technical details.
With that said I've always found that 2-of-3 systems where 1 key is held by the provider isn't actually that much more secure than putting your coins on Mt Gox. The one main benefit is that the wallet provider can't run away, but in this case it's not like Bitfinex or Bitgo were stealing your coins. All the attacker needs to get is one of the other 2 keys.
So let's put it this way--if someone can hack your MtGox password and steal your coins, they can likely do the same and steal your coins out of Bitgo. Your benefits of moving to 2-of-3 are mainly to protect you from the provider from running off. So in this case, even if Bitfinex had all their coins in Bitgo, all someone needed to do was get one of the key Bitfinex had and that's enough to start transactions. The key held by Bitgo is essentially automated--it does whatever the other keyholder tells it to do.

You have a point but who audits Bitcoin exchanges as to how much customer funds they have? That's the point. You have to prove the coins being moved around ARE from a theft, and that's the beauty of Bitcoin. Yes it's fully on the blockchain but at the same time you have to link addresses to exchanges/individuals to prove who owns those funds.
An exchange can go belly up like Gox or any other shady no-name site and you'd never be able to know how much was lost unless all the customers report how much they actually had and you go on a forensics trail.

Deposits of over $10k trigger banks to automatically report some information to the IRS. They might ask you some information, but you're better off depositing $100k at once rather than making small deposits. Small deposits make it look like you're structuring even if it's totally legal money.

Part of that is marketing speak. How much more validation do they put in their 2-of-3 before signing for you than a standard 1-of-1 use like Coinbase? The Vault has withdrawal limits and 48 hour delay along with co-signer approval as well.
You're right BitGo does some fraud detection (probably 2FA, transaction limits, etc.), but what do you really expect that to do? It's not a human being. It's not that smart. The client (you) is definitely not signing on behalf of BitGo, but in many ways that's what a 2-of-3 wallet service is.. BitGo and Coinbase will pretty much do what you tell it to do. A proper multi-signature system involves multiple parties (humans) in control of the keys.
I've emphasized this many times in 2-of-3 setups--if someone steals your Coinbase or BitGo password, you're pretty much screwed.

I wrote slam, meaning it was certainly a bad mistake by Coinbase, but given that everyone who was affected was reimbursed or eligible for reimbursement, they really aren't the big bad wallet that everyone claims them to be. As I said before, almost all losses are due to user error and poor opsec.
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:38:56
But the thing is the tool is meant for you to move the funds if Coinbase disappears. While I agree this tool needs to be fixed, Coinbase is still alive and well. You can move the funds by having Coinbase as one of the signers and you providing your other key.
Using the backup key as OP is trying to do is mainly for when Coinbase disappears and should be a last resort essentially. I feel like OP is not explaining hte full situation clearly.

For a multi-sig wallet where 1 of the keys is held by the provider (in this case BitGo), it's not designed to make the wallet that much more secure from a user perspective. It's designed so the "bank"/service cannot run away with your funds.
For the user, it's still supposed to be as easy as logging in with your 1 key. The second key that BitGo holds will do whatever you instruct it to do. Think about it--logging into a BitGo wallet or Coinbase Multi-Sig wallet is as easy as logging into your account. That's the point. It's supposed to be as easy as a 1-of-1 wallet (think Gox or standard Coinbase), but with the protection that you can ultimately recover your funds because you have 2 of the keys.
If you want a truly secure 2-of-3 solution, then you need to generate those keys and give a key to an actual individual (maybe a business partner) that can verify spend requests. Otherwise, BitGo, Coinbase, Conkite, etc when they hold your key for you, they automatically sign for you.

You're correct, but that's not really relevant who holds the keys in this case. Obviously we aren't talking about if you are the only one who holds the keys because if that were the case, this heist wouldn't have been possible. If customer funds are in separate addresses, it's much like a safety deposit box in that sense. The analogy holds once the service has access, which is true with Bitfinex and any bank.
You might now hold the actual private keys, but in some sense you have a virtual key in that you can tell Bitfinex what to do with that money.
The point I'm trying to get at really is losses, and whether you hold the keys or not is not the point. Is it fair to say that the individuals who suffered no loss in their address should be penalized? I'm not trying to take sides but this is a fair question that needs to be addressed as a part of the resolution of this issue.
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:59:30
Right but that's not the point I'm getting at. I'm talking about a loss that affects certain customers and not and whether or not socialized loss is acceptable. In a bank you would never see this happen as insurance would step in regardless of whose safety deposit boxes were broken into.
But in the event there was no insurance and we're talking about say a parking lot of cars being broken into, you wouldn't penalize those who got lucky and make them pay for the ones who got their cars broken into right? That's what I'm trying to put in perspective.
It's not about whether your goods are fungible or not. I'm merely looking at the idea of loss for a group versus the individual.
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:39:51
Agreed, but why isn't the OP withdrawing the money using the standard method of using the Coinbase website? I have funds in the Multi-Sig wallet and I moved some out a few weeks ago. It's not hard.

Authy provides 2FA security that's backed up in the cloud. Keep in mind someone just needs to hijack the multi-sig key that Bitfinex holds. Typically that's encrypted by a password and then maybe guarded by 2FA. But if you can get access to the raw key itself, then you're set.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:09:52
Do you understand how a 2-of-3 wallet works when one of hte keys is held by another provider?
BitGo and Coinbase's 2-of-3 wallets function much like a 1-of-1 wallet in that once you log in with your key, you can do whatever you want. BitGo and Coinbase will cosign. Sure there may be limitations like transaction limits or delays, but essentially if you really want a human being vetting your transactions, then you need to implement a 2-of-3 where the keys are held by actual individuals who make judgement calls about transactions (think Copay with 3 people).
Think about it this way with Coinbase--if your account is compromised, then whether or not you use 2-of-3 multisig or their 1-of-1 wallet, you're screwed. I think people need to understand how 2-of-3 works and what benefits it provides along with the limitations instead of assuming 100% security

This is why every corporate press release is typically vetted over and over again by lawyers to ensure that you're not saying anything incorrect.

Not 100% safe, but nor is holding $2k in a bank account. Let's not get into a whole "omg what if" scenario. For the average user their couple grand is fine on Coinbase so long as their account is secured with a strong password + 2FA.
I would however recommend a better storage medium if your funds are exceeding $1k. If you have multi-sig storage, then maybe not so urgent.

People need to understand how 2-of-3 works when one of the keys is held by BitGo. A 2-of-3 setup like this is very similar to a 1-of-1 in that you have the convenience of logging and spending money. The benefit of 2-of-3 is such that BitGo holds your key but cannot run away with your funds.
Now they can implement "secure features" like delayed withdrawals, confirmations, transaction limits, but you can implement that at Coinbase too. I think it's important to recognize what 2-of-3 gives you here because if someone gets ahold of your password, they can just log into BitGo and drain your wallet.
Now my understanding is Bitfinex uses wallet APIs, because there certainly wouldn't be someone who sits at Bitfinex and manually logs in to process transfers through BitGo, but the function of a 2-of-3 wallet is still important to understand. So are we just blaming BitGo because we automatically think 2-of-3 makes them responsible? Or are people not understanding the limits of 2-of-3 security in this case?
@_date: 2016-08-26 17:06:31
Thanks for explaining. I could understand if the backup recovery in a single person managed vault would be broken or problematic (then again it still is something Coinbase ought to address), but if the only way to withdraw from a group vault is using this tool, you'd think there would be a lot more issues regularly and Coinbase would've fixed it?
The other thing is, wouldn't it have made sense for Coinbase to have it setup as (let's say its a 3 of 3 key) all 3 having to log into their Coinbase account? I find it odd the real withdrawal method is using some app and not their website. That's extremely not user friendly.

Theyre completely usable if you understand how it works and the limitations. As I've said before most of the lost funds deal with fhe following:
- Poor password choice
- No 2FA
- Misplacement of backups. Even if you change your password, old backups work still with the old password. You should always sweep your funds into a new address if you change your password.
- Poor password choice for email, and thereby recovering old backups.
To be fair if you have a unique and strong password (we're talking 16+ characters here), then you honestly even 2FA should be irrelevant. Your wallet isn't going to be brute forced.

@_date: 2016-08-25 22:42:46


They could, but they would have to do that for every user out there, and if you chose a strong password, then you should be ok.
Keep in mind the 2-of-3 system that Coinbase sets up is about convenience. The reason the shared key is stored by them is so you can log in. Effectively it's like a 1-of-1 wallet where they control the keys in terms of user interface, but it in reality is a 2-of-3 in the back end.
In a more secure world they never touch 2 of those keys and you generate them yourself. It also makes transferring funds more of a pain.

Well you need to evaluate what your threat model is. 2-of-3 systems where the 1 of the keys are held by the Wallet service are more meant where you are afraid of a service running off with your money (i.e. Gox) or dying off like many other Wallet services have. They're a significant increase in security in that sense compared to Circle/Coinbase's standard offerings.
If you're afraid that 1 piece of information is all that's required, then perhaps 2 factor authentication would be useful. Coinbase's Multi Sig and BitGo still offer that.
The idea behind those kinds of 2-of-3 systems are that you can spend with ease but with the increased security that you control the coins because you have 2 of the 3 keys in your possession.
The model that Copay uses is that you hold the keys yourself and you split it X # of ways. It works great if you have a business partner, but if I hide a second key on my tablet, then I need both my phone and tablet to do anything. Or I'd have to settle for a 1-of-1 secondary wallet with some loose change.
I'm not saying there's only 1 way to do things. People need to evaluate what makes sense for them and their usage patterns. The reason why I push Coinbase and BitGo so heavily are because their 2-of-3 models are the more traditional sense that a lot of users have setup in Coinkite also. If you're setup is where you control all 3 keys fully, then Copay might make more sense.

@_date: 2016-08-25 22:44:03
Let's also keep in mind Coinbase has 2 kinds of vaults:
- Shared vault where Coinbase controls the private keys. This is only a bit more safer than regular Coinbase because there's withdraw delays and additional confirmations you need to give (2 emails?)
- Multi-Sig vault: Think 2-of-3 with BitGo or Coinkite.
The latter is obviously more secure because Coinbase in theory can't run off with your funds.

You don't have to give up your password. However, the more we change that digital key into a physical key, then the more likely it is you are held in contempt. For instance the keys to a safe you are required to give up.


That's not what I'm arguing. If multi-sig is kept as passwords that each party remembers, then you can invoke the 5th amendment. If it's simply a set of 5 physical keys, then that's where you have to give it up. That was my whole point, that certain types of keys (passwords) do not have to be given up, but physical keys do.

US only, but it's a social payment system developed by PayPal. It's essentially dumbing it down further by auto-adding contacts based on phone # (think WhatsApp). You send money via email, phone # or contact name and that's it.
It uses ACH. I never understood the fascination because it has a stupid news feed (think Facebook for payments.. what the fuck right?). I can see people charging each other for drinks or as always my guy friends are always posting stupid sexual innuendo messages. You can turn it all on private, but it's become the payment method of choice whether I'm in LA, NYC or San Francisco. Most less tech-centric places probably haven't adopted it yet. I noticed how NYC was significantly behind and most of my friends still wanted to PayPal (Thank goodness).
I'm no fan of Venmo at all, but honestly in terms of collecting money it does make it dead simple. Instead of figuring out cash payments between friends at restaurants, we almost always just say someone pay and we'll Venmo. I've tried suggesting Circle but got shot down.

I feel like people don't understand 2-of-3 security when **one of the keys is held by the provider.** It's not really meant to be that much more secure. The obvious benefit is that the provider can't run away with your funds, but if your password is weak (same issue when Gox was hacked), someone can log in just as easily and empty your funds like a 1-of-1 wallet like the standard Coinbase wallet.
Such a 2-of-3 setup is meant for ease of use where it functions like a 1-of-1. There isn't somemagical bulletproof safe that gets constructed for you just because you switched to 2-of-3.

I appreciate what you guys have done with Copay and I recognize the benefits, but if I want to use it as a 2-of-3 similar to BitGo/Coinbase/Coinkite where one of the keys is held by the wallet provider, then Copay doesn't work.
I suppose the workflow would be to create a 1-of-1 wallet for normal transactions and a 2-of-2 (with a desktop or tablet or second device) for storing larger funds.
With the other providers, the idea is with 2-of-3 you could put a large amount of BTC and feel relatively safe because they can't run off. Normal use is effectively like 1-of-1 where you log in and send coins. You only need to trigger your backup keys if the service dies off.
That kind of convenience yet coupled with key sharing doesn't yet exist with Copay, which is something I'm missing.
@_date: 2016-04-12 18:41:37
Those are for API calls though right? Sure you could develop your own APIs and run your own servers, but what happens if the wallet decides to cease operations? Relying on 3rd party APIs and servers still has some benefits. Maybe not for being totally anonymous, but still, having a working wallet IMO is more important.

Here are some assumptions here from my part. Coinbase closed your account because you're a high risk account. Most of that likely stems from the fact that you went to Iran AND used the same Coinbase account. Having Coinbase and visiting Iran doesn't mean you get autobanned. I flew to the ME last year with no issues. The difference is I don't log into Coinbase regularly on my phone.
With that said I do wish they were more helpful in support because you seem like you have a legitimate case to appeal. Even if they ultimately decide not to do business with you, they need to give you a pain-free way to withdraw your funds.

Most of the Blockchain.info horror stories are due to people who:
1. Used shitty passwords.
2. Sent backups all over the place and misplaced them and those backups got compromised (same private keys unless you sweep your funds regularly)
3. Got their emails compromised.
The RNG issues at Blockchain were fully reimbursed. I'm not saying you should use Blockchain--most people shouldn't, but there isn't some sort of inherent threat from using them. If you do use them think of it this way... it's fully client side decrypted, so assume your encrypted wallet file stored at Blockchain could be compromised at any moment. The only thing protecting your funds is a strong password.

That's a bigger issue though. There are currently no laws in the US that force you to divulge your password. If the FBI nabs one of your laptops with a TrueCrypt drive, you don't have to give up the password.
The more you make encryption keys (even if multi sig) like real keys, the closer you get to forcing people to give it up. I like multi-sig in principle, but the general public can't use it unless its something as simple as plugging in a USB drive. I'm pretty sure the feds can subpoena a USB drive versus a key you memorize.

I'm glad you learned about the word average/mean in your elementary school math, but it goes beyond that. A simple average makes sense in a normally distributed population, but incomes are not normally distributed.
Also keep in mind people make more in their lifetimes as they progress in careers. For instance in the 20s-early 30s, incomes can jump a lot as people advance. Taking a simple average and then multiplying by years makes no sense. And yes, my point about part time workers does make sense. If you're a stay-at-home mom who takes in $20k a year doing a part time catering business while your husband brings home an $80k paycheck, saying that she won't ever see $1.8 million is stupid if the husband is making plenty to get to that amount.

The problem on this sub is people all want to say things like "The fed is evil." "Governments suck." "Fiat should burn." and think they're above the law.

It depends on perspective. When I see newgrads land jobs with $150k salaries in the Silicon Valley it can't be that bad. When you look at those top companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, etc. their work forces are incredibly young. If anything I'd argue older workers have a substantial challenge keeping up there because you have to keep up with tech to remain as agile as a younger work force. 
This is nothing new though. Every generation cries they're getting screwed over, but rather than to sit and complain, I always tell people to look at what they can do to improve their situation.

I take no sides in this BTC BCH war but I think many were overly confident in BCHs demise. Given it’s price held over the past few weeks it was pretty clear to me Coinbase opening up would result in a surge not a panic dump. With that said we should all hold on as it’s going to be a rocky ride.

Yes it's expensive, but that's also why the salaries are so high. As for kids, I think there's multiple factors.

I think you're doing a smart thing given your age but at the same time if you are set in retirement funds, you could also let that money ride. With that said you still have a good portion in crypto so that's fine.


I thought about this more last week, and while it's popular here to trash BCH, doesn't the conversion also trigger a huge tax bill? Yeah you could be fortunate to have been gifted 200 BCH through the fork, but selling that today would mean a 100k tax bill.

Because it doesn't mean you actually understand personal finance yet. Yes many of us are getting lucky with BTC and it looks like a pretty solid bet so far, but even 40 year olds struggle with basic concepts of budgeting and saving.

I'm a millennial myself and doing just fine. I can point to many who aren't, and it's not at all hard to figure out what they're doing wrong is because of the choices they made. Yes times are tough, but when aren't they? Housing costs are going up, so you should consider your income potential seriously when you go to college and pick a major.

Some have argued there's a zero cost basis. There's two interpretations, which is you pay taxes immediately upon BCH fork, or if you use a zero cost basis, you pay upon sale. The IRS hasn't clarified so everyone's just doing their own thing.

I agree with you completely about controlling your keys, so anyone who STORES coins should get into trouble, but this is a mining marketplace. Obviously you'd be an idiot to store all your coins there, but if you had a few coins that were in process or whatever, it makes sense. Just like if I wanted to trade coins, I'd have some money in GDAX or Gemini, but obviously not my whole life savings.
Even if you work to minimize presence in an online wallet to a few seconds to complete your sales, what if you're just unlucky then? You can't just say "never put your money into an online exchange..." Well how does one ever sell/transfer money?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:00:27
It's a good balance honestly. I did some math and tech workers can retire very wealthy at 65 as long as you manage your spending habits. However, let's say you retire with $4 million at 65. That's a lot of money. If you've paid off your mortgage, your kids are most likely working at that point too, meaning your expenses are pretty minimal.
I guess you can afford now for cutting edge treatment when it comes to end of life care or you do some serious blowing of funds with luxury travel or something. 
I do agree though that retiring at 45 is a bit ridiculous. It's possible, but you have to be pretty frugal per those early retirement subs. I did some math and I'm far more comfortable working another 20 years.

So you have a million users with a shared wallet that's guarded with the utmost security because you don't want a Bitfinex or MtGox event. A fork is created. Can you update your systems on Day 1 to credit everyone coins and allow trading/withdrawals?

Yeah it's easy to handle the fork from a 1 user basis. Much harder on a large scale.

It's not confirmation bias. It's groupthink. Compound that with the fact that it really does seem a lot of people are completely irresponsible or don't have good finance practices. We talked about this in another thread where there were kids blaming parents for not letting them buy Bitcoin.
I don't know about you but when I was 15 I got my weekly allowance and I just spent it. I saved sometimes for larger purchases, but overall it was a good learning experience. I could've learned more about saving for the future and retirement investments and maybe even budgeting. I think those are good fundamental steps for kids to take before just jumping into Bitcoin. The problem is this mentality of get rich quick and also some sort of fanatical religion that fiat is evil and Bitcoin will wreck it all.
We could absolutely be right and Bitcoin takes over, but there are thousands of other ideas that people thought would revolutionize the world that never took off. If everything fails I can still look at my 401k and my regular contributions as being a safe nest egg.

You did something good for her, but honestly trashing 9% annual ROI because Bitcoin exists isn't wise either. Yes many people here got lucky and rich over crypto, but I could argue many also got rich playing the stock market with stocks like TSLA or AAPL. That doesn't mean you throw away long term investing advice.
For instance, I still max out my 401k, and I put extra savings into my brokerage account which also follows long term strategies with ETF buys. That doesn't mean I can't invest in crypto either. I just want to make sure we don't spend all our time here trashing traditional investment advice because if you're going to throw all that out the window so easily, it's more likely your personal finances aren't in order.

The issue is there's more important concepts of saving and budgeting to be learned at a young age. That's what an allowance is for. For kids to learn to save $10 of their $30 weekly allowance for instance is something that even 40 year olds struggle with in our debt culture.
Yes you can have a kid buy Bitcoin and he could get rich, but most likely investing will still be a lost concept by them. I get this sub is really anti-fiat, but I think that it's better to understand how to save your money first and how inflation will outgrow your money under a mattress, understand 401k savings, investment accounts, etc, and then Bitcoin as another investment. Without the basic personal finance skills that most people should have, jumping straight into Bitcoin will result in the same disastrous financial management that screws plenty of people over with credit card debt, etc.

I agree you wouldn't be outrageously rich, but 4 million also means he's been contributing regularly to his 401k and likely maxing it out. Keep in mind 401k limits were significantly less back then.

Yes I agree there are 2-of-3 solutions out there and I use BitGo as well as Coinbase, so I'm well aware of how they work--but as it stands look at how many mobile wallets people are using. If anything those are single points of failure--lose the phone and you're royally screwed. Plus, how many people are using Coinbase's 2 of 3 versus just their standard wallet? That's a lot to potentially lose.
I'm not saying Coinbase is going to run with your funds tomorrow, but the Target breach was completely overrated. Was it a minor inconvenience? Yes, but you were liable for none of the fraudulent charges even if you did get your CC scooped up and used.

There's the adage that says work smart not hard. You can work hard but if you're working in the wrong direction, that won't do you any good. Like for instance if you want your finances in shape, you can work hard at your job and get paid well, but without a budget you can still spend into debt. So where working smart comes in is looking at your finances from a bigger picture--are you budgeting your monthly expenses well? Are you putting together a long term savings/investment plan? All that adds up. How does your career look in the next year or 5 years or 15 years? When you look at statistics like people not even being able to fund a $2000 emergency expense, that tells you basic financial literacy is just lacking in the US.

The liability is shifting isn't it? That's why retailers need to adopt EMV to continue down the same liability path today.
The PIN factor isn't really an issue in the US because magnetic swipe required a connection anyway. The PIN Was only used in rural places in Europe because internet deployment wasn't that ubiquitous, and so for places that couldn't get authorization for the transaction, the PIN was used for offline transactions to authenticate that it indeed is your card.
Since the US' terminals are all online anyway, the move to chip should not require a PIN anyway. Would a PIN be more secure? Probably, but at the same time the biggest weakness in the system was being able to steal the data off the magnetic stripe--that's no longer an issue once you move to a chip.

Yes but wages have been roughly flat over the past few decades, meaning it's on par with inflation. Keep in mind also that inflation since 2008 has been relatively mild, so just pointing fingers at inflation isn't really meaningful.

Yep but credit cards came into existence because it doesn't make sense for you to hold on to all your cash.
But even today, it makes more sense because there are protections in place whereas in debit cards even if you are a responsible spender where you don't go into debt, the fact that you can have your funds compromised and have to wait to get them back means its safer to resort to a CC.
I'd say it would be quite a while before credit cards die and we really need something much better than the Bitcoin infrastructure we have in place today to do it.
@_date: 2015-12-02 19:23:48
Online wallet? It depends, do you want control of the keys? If so probably Blockchain. I know they get a lot of flak but you can at least export the wallet and take it on the go.
Coinbase / Circle are also options if you don't mind them holding onto the keys.
Multi-sig Coinbase and Bitgo are relatively reasonable too. Same with Coinkite if you set it up properly.
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:45:14
And millions of credit cards are stolen but you're liable for none of the damages. That's the point. It's also why the US is finally moving to EMV tokenization.
I agree with Bitcoin you can keep your own private keys, but this is like Blockchain.info getting hacked and private keys getting leaked or Coinbase getting hacked and their keys getting swept. While you can hold your own key, those who didn't will have been royally screwed **with no recourse**
The whole Target breach was overrated and that's why I provided my experience to show you how little of a deal it was. No liability on my part. I lost no funds. That's what ultimately matters to the consumer.

The FBI hacked the Iceland server actually--in fact this is one of the dangers of putting your data abroad. If the data was on a US server that Ulbricht owned, it would've been different as you could argue the 4th amendment applies there. With foreign data servers? Not much you can do about it.
And if anything, the NSA was built to intercept foreign communications. There's legal roadblocks for US citizens supposedly even if the feds can go circumvent them; at least when you're caught you have a solid chance of trying to get that kind of spying thrown out. Stuff flowing to foreign servers will 100% guaranteed be spied on by the NSA as its within their legal realm.
Obviously there's benefits and downsides to US servers, but every time someone brings up the fact that the US spies and to avoid US servers, you're not exactly immune on a foreign server either.

Eh, if your Bitcoin private key was breached, its gone forever. 
I had my Chase Southwest card compromised and they caught a $50 transaction and denied it, called me, and I got a new card next-day-UPSed to my house.
Does it suck to have your credit card compromised? Yeah, but its at least recoverable. Plus, this kind of stuff should be less of a problem as the US transitions to EMV cards.
Funny story--one of my cards actually got compromised yesterday and Chase mailed me a card. However, I didn't even get my card yet and needed to get gas, but Apple Pay is tied via EMV tokenization, so I was able to pay with Apple Pay even though I had my old deactivated card in my wallet.

The idea is that the US government won't let it come to that point, and they will do everything they can including bailing out the banks. We all probably agree the Big 4 banks got away with a lot in 2008, but the government knew that if even one of them failed, the whole economy would be in a lot deeper shit than it fell in back then. That's why we bailed them out.

Well that's the concept behind an insurance policy. I don't think anyone truly believes insurance should just cease to exist and everyone should be liable for their own health care. Even the most anti-government folks on the right wing will admit health care at its basic principle is to ensure that everyone has access to basic affordable services so that you aren't going to die over having the flu.
Bitcoin as it is right now is every man for himself--those who fail to manage keys properly are screwed and scolded by That might work if you're a smart guy who managed your keys properly, but good luck with adoption.
The idea behind a credit card is that it works for the masses. Rather than slamming credit cards, you should think about how to help Bitcoin get to the masses.

That's because Coinbase is an entry way into Bitcoin from fiat and vice versa. OF course there are tons of KYC activities.

I think we have too many kids on who don't really understand finances. People should look at the 2008 bank crisis. Those banks that went under? People got their funds the same day or within 2 days easily. If the FDIC can't insure your money, you likely have bigger problems to worry about.

This is the problem. When I want to buy a $100 item, I don't even know how much to send. So I send extra and that money just gets tied up in a wallet somewhere.
I get that it's cool to spend Bitcoins, and I would love to get there someday, but I get the following with my credit card:
- Cash back
- Extended warranty
- Return protection
- Price protection: I've used this one at least half a dozen times now where Amazon lowers prices and I get a check mailed to me.
Not to mention a lot of other perks for other purchases. For airfare, I get delay and baggage coverage. For rental cars I get primary insurance coverage.

Well yes, cold storage should definitely be in another form, but in terms of a hot wallet where you can get your private keys pretty quickly, Blockchain.info isn't bad. Remember I said hot wallet, so putting like $20-$100 is reasonable--anything you're comfortable with losing.
Savings should be somewhere more secure like a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet, a deterministic wallet, or even hardware solutions.

Its definitely pretty user friendly for sure, but if I setup Multisig where 3 of the keys are all stored on Coinkite HSM, that kinda defeats the purpose of multi sig given that its all stored on Coinkite.
That's where I bring up Coinbase--because their multi sig setup seems painless. I want to setup something similar with similar or better security on Coinkite, and that's why I'm wondering if a smart setup would be soemthing along the lines of
- HSM storage
- HSM but encrypted
- Generated key from Coinkite's offline generator
Not sure if that would be something equivalent to Coinbase or as good as GreenAddress' security.

There are better ways to avoid fees and currency conversion fees. For instance, I travel with my Schwab debit card. You get 100% reimbursement for ATM fees and zero foreign conversion fees. I regularly travel to Asia and land with close to zero cash. I just go to the ATM and get cash as I need it.
Similarly, for credit card users, get a card that doesn't have foreign conversion fees.

Are you a kid or something? If Coinbase goes under the water, your bitcoins are gone. While legal recourse could bring it back, there's no guarantee. In the 2008 panic, banks went under and people were able to recover their funds within 2 days or less due to the FDIC. If the FDIC can't help you, then the state of the US is probably so screwed you're better off stocking guns and ammo.

It depends what you have loaded onto your Blockchain account. Watch only address? Safe. Address where the private key is loaded? Not safe.
Say you have Address A that you created with your Blockchain account and have a bad password. That backup is somewhere in your email, and even if you deleted it, let's put on the tinfoil hat for a second and imagine that file is somewhere sitting on Google's servers or the NSA's servers. If it hasn't been compromised yet, it likely will be if one day Big Bro is out there to seize your funds.
Okay, so you create Address B and in the process you realize oh crap, the password can be improved. You change password, enable 2FA, enable 2nd password, and you sweep your funds to Address B. Sure, but Address B was created with a bad password. That backup wallet containing Address B + bad password likely exists somewhere.
You can create Address C after going full tinfoil with your security upgrades, and that will be much safer.
Basically anything that exists before the password change is likely tainted, so get out of there.
But this is assuming you go full tinfoil. If you're aware that you only had 1 email backup, you can delete it, and I can guarantee you that if you're sure your email hasn't been compromised yet, then besides the NSA hacking in, it's unlikely that anyone else will be able to breach your account. This is assuming you know of all your backups and can get rid of the bad backups leaving only the most recent good backup.
To be realistic, a lot of people on and in general are overly cautious. I think we place too much faith in cold storage and ignore the PEBKAC issues behind that. Meanwhile, how many people have actually gotten compromised via a keylogger? How many people are using keyloggers to steal Bitcoin private keys anyway? Keyloggers have been around forever and how many people have lost their credit card numbers to one? How many people have lost their credit card numbers to a security breach at a merchant's site? Aha! It tells you what you should be more afraid of.

1.  Migrate your tokens to Authy.
2.  Turn backups on for Authy.
3.  Switch to new phone.
4.  The backups are tied to your phone # and e-mail I believe, so once you install Authy for that new phone, you're good to go.
5.  If you're scared that it won't work, enable multi device. This way it won't disable your iPhone's Authy upon a new installation. You can run both to make sure they both work before getting rid of your iPhone.

How many confirmed thefts are there where malware or keyloggers were the issue? I feel like its an excuse we throw out when people lose their Bitcoins when most of the time its:
- Weak Password
- Screwing up change addresses
- E-Mail compromise leading to Hot wallet compromise
I have yet to run into a situation where we confirmed that some software uploaded a wallet file on their computer unknowingly or whatever.

You make it sound like Voice has a vulnerability. It's more that you shouldn't use Voice as 2FA because a lot of hacks come from Gmail accounts and if your Gmail is compromised, so is your Google Voice.

What's the point of confirming on 2 emails? This wreaks of issues because the second email is likely a junk e-mail or one less secure than the first one.
Perhaps an option to confirm via email + text would work... kinda like Authy. Or even better add a whole suite of options:
- confirm via email
- confirm via 2nd email
- confirm via text
- confirm via second password
- No confirmation, delayed withdrawal only
Make those all checkboxes and a user can check as many as they want.
Yes I realize that this does nothing to address the fact that a 3rd party has your Bitcoins and can run off.
Given that Coinbase is a hot wallet and I have 2FA setup, I feel like no confirmation and delayed withdrawal is sufficient (i.e. they notify you on email and text, and it's an opt out scenario in 24 or 48 hours)

Don't think there's a simple import. If you have the QR code backup or the text written down somewhere, you can add it into Authy. If not, I don't think it's the worst thing in the world to generate new QR codes for Authy either as not that many sites are using Google Authenticator.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:19:40
Yes but if you started out with a crappy password (say Correct Horse Battery Staple), and you decided to make a better password and enable 2FA because you've learned about all these Bitcoin heists, then your old backup will still be protected by your weak passphrase.
Your new backups will have the new passphrase. You should make sure to delete any old backups. To be extra sure, sweep your funds to a new address because if the NSA already got your old backup for example and do access your funds, they can only access the wallets backed up in the old backup. If you add a new address and sweep your funds into the new address that is also secured by a better password, you're better off.
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:15:20
The Google Authenticator app is not open source either.
Before you all just go Google that, what's open source is the implementation of the Google Authenticator token. This is exactly what Authy takes to allow for Google Authenticator tokens to work on their app.
The actual app you install on your iPhone or Android phone is not open source.
@_date: 2014-12-16 01:26:18


Which is why its important your BCI wallet is secured with a strong password. Additionally, its important to ensure your backups aren't sitting around readily accessed. It's just like your cold storage paper private keys are good until someone breaks into your house or until you accidentally toss it into the shredder.
@_date: 2014-06-05 01:56:04
What Coinbase needs:
- Similar to Eclipse mining, but delayed send--That is if you're allowed to send your Bitcoins out of your Coinbase wallet to another address, that you should be able to lock that output address to something you own. Any change from that requires a 24 - 48 hour wait and/or e-mail / SMS / 2FA confirmation.
@_date: 2014-06-05 01:19:54
Furthermore even if your Google Voice is secure, if you lose your phone.... Or look away for a second, etc.
This is why Google Authenticator needs to have PIN access like its competitors like Authy.
@_date: 2014-06-05 04:09:27
It takes seconds to open Google Authenticator. Who knows how long til you realize the theft. My point is a PIN access to the app itself would be helpful. You don't want even your friend to just play with your phone and open the wrong app.

I do want to ask how big of a problem this is in general. Is this an issue for the users who can't figure out that their computer won't turn on at work because it got unplugged, or is this an issue for the general tech savvy user? For most savvy users like myself, I've rarely been infected with anything, and I'd consider myself to be 99% safe if I setup a brand new system today with no anti virus. Not saying I would run like that, but I'm willing to bet on it that I can keep myself pretty safe. So considering I do take standard precautions and do install anti malware and anti virus software, I don't see how keyloggers will be an issue given that I already know to avoid shady software or links.
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:09:34
I completely agree with OP here. Almost all cases I have seen are user error issues. Bad passwords, not setting 2FA, e-mail hacked (no 2FA also), backups with weak passwords, etc.

You're absolutely right, but for someone who knows cold storage, they know that is the best. However, from a marketing perspective, this certainly is a cold storage alternative. For those who are on the fence about cold storage or want easier access to their funds without jumping through hoops, this is a very viable solution.
Bitgo I think is a very similar solution and they call their solution "Cold storage security with online wallet ease"

@_date: 2014-03-23 20:26:24
Would you rather lose access to your accounts? Eclipse Mining makes you wait 30 days if you need to disable 2FA. Plus Authy stores an encrypted copy of your tokens. What do you really lose if someone has your tokens anyway? They still need your password. The point of 2FA isn't that you can have a shitty 4 character password now. 
Furthermore Authy uses Google Authenticator which is an open source TOTP token. And its not like any of you actually compile your own Google Authenticator app. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:08:17
Authy has their own proprietary protocol but they also have support for GA tokens, which was my point. The GA token is open source.
TOTP wasn't developed by Google, but they have utilized RFC6238 to develop their Google Authenticator system, an open source authenticator which Authy also supports. That was my point.
Furthermore, if you don't like Authy's own proprietary protocol like for Coinbase, you can still use a GA token.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:17:38
Are the wallet backups themselves (once you download them) not protected by 2FA anymore?
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:26:25
Authy &gt; Google Authenticator.
If you ever lose your Authenticator installation, you're SOL. It's easy to lose a phone, have your phone crash, need to factory reset, etc. What do you do?
Authy backs up your 2FA encrypted in the cloud and makes sure you verify both your phone AND email AND having to enter your passphrase before allowing you to recover your 2FA. But the point is you can recover your 2FA. Good luck trying to convince bitcoin sites to disable 2FA because you lost your phone.

Is the second password for Block chain stored separately on the server just like 2FA? Or is it actually in the wallet backup itself?
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:17:52
Here's my strategy to dealing with the issue:
1) Print out the 10 codes and put it in your wallet.
2) Use Authy. They have a cloud backup option that allows you to backup all the 2FA keys. Worried that someone might take over? With a new installation of Authy, I believe you need to confirm via both SMS AND E-mail before it lets you in.
It's too scary to lose your 2FA key because sites like Blockchain will stall forever, same with some mining sites.
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:05:13
Thanks for the help. I just remember a notice going out last week or so. I guess there wasn't that much information released initially, but I guess people were alarmed first.
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:16:09


But isn't In a 2 of 3 situation, isn't 1 key stored at the company? So essentially, if your second key (the password), is compromised, your funds are instantly accessible no? I don't get how this is more secure than say if you had 1 of 1 at Blockchain.info
@_date: 2014-03-14 07:42:57
- It's encrypted by a passphrase of your choosing
- It also verifies your phone number AND email address before you can even download that backup not to mention you have to decrypt it.
- Furthermore, this is 2FA, not losing your password. Even if someone gets ahold of your 2FA keys you can generate new keys. They still need your password at the end of the day.
- The encryption is zero knowledge. Decryption is done client side.
To me, the added convenience of not worrying about losing your phone, wiping your phone, getting a new phone, transferring to a new phone, etc. is much better. While Google makes it decently easy to have backup methods of receiving 2FA codes (like a fallback to SMS, or even backup codes), good luck convincing a site like Eclipse MC to disable 2FA. They'll wait 30 days before even acting. Good luck trying to get your funds out of Mt. Gox for example just days before they stopped dispersing any funds.
Finally, if you don't trust Authy, you can disable the backups. But even without the cloud feature, Authy is 1 step ahead of Google Authenticator. At least the app can be PIN protected.
@_date: 2014-06-07 00:14:12
Its ok. A lot of people here on this thread have no idea WTF they're talking about. We have people who don't even know how to get a credit card, yet in you have people who are trying to figure out how to get a card every 30 days after owning 20+ cards.

TBH Blockchain is far better than Coinbase for this purpose. You're in control of your funds because it's stored in YOUR wallet. Just make sure you have a secure copy of your wallet backed up somewhere so if Blockchain ever goes belly up you have an easy way to access your funds.

I stand corrected, but kinda like [this post]( the point of me promoting Authy is because I did my due diligence and researched both apps heavily. Sure you can bring up the open source issue, but people are using Google Authenticator only because others are using it. They don't understand much more.
The problem that many users face is that it's too easy to lose 2FA codes. People don't know to back them up or use Titanium Backup ahead of time. You can't control when you lose your phone or when your phone accidentally drowns. You also might have unexpected data loss.
I'm promoting a very secure alternative that works for a lot of people. Furthermore, you can choose NOT to use any of the cloud services if you find that to be compromising of your security. In the end it offers the same functionality as Google Authenticator, but with more options. At the very minimum, I believe in PIN locking, and knowing how Google responds to its customers by taking forever to even improve apps, you know it can be years before they ever offer a PIN lock mechanism to Google Authenticator.
In the end you can choose to be vigilant and avoid any non open source app, but the fact is you're still trusting the apks you installed match the source. However I'm OK with trusting Authy just like many trust LastPass.

My point is Authy offers the convenience of cloud backup protected by client side encryption. As others have said, the idea behind 2FA isn't that your 2FA keys are invulnerable. You still need a strong password.

That alone is concerning enough. The fact that he then relied on 2FA to prevent the break-in is risky. There are only 1,000,000 2FA codes for a 6 digit 2FA. Futhermore, if you got 2FA codes via SMS or Google Voice like many do, that could be easily intercepted too if your Google Voice was not secured as well.

No offense to Zimbabwe, but you can't always use poor and unstable countries as the counter-example. Instead of Bitcoin then we should be using some scam altcoin with very low adoption. The US Dollar is the most adopted currency worldwide and is used all around the globe. It's also backed by a powerful military, and alliances that would make sure the US is propped up.
Even if the US dominance faded away kinda like the way the way UK and France did after the 19th century, the currency would still be very powerful (just like the GBP is still today). If the US really goes the way of Zimbabwe, I think there's a lot more to worry about at that point.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:58:21
Heh. Even if you have 2FA on there's still multiple loopholes as I mentioned. If you keep an old backup with a bad password, your weakest link is the bad password. You just have to be smart as others said.
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:18:46
That's why wallet apps are focused on security while maintaining ease of use. They're not designed to be just cash. The idea behind any payment system like PayPal, credit card, etc. is that its LIKE cash in that you can freely spend large amounts of money yet being relatively secure.
If the OP was storing wallet.dat on his phone to be secure, that would be worse.
@_date: 2014-06-05 01:21:02
Yet its so easy to screw up 2FA. Look at all the threads encouraging backup. Too many people lose phones or have to wipe their phones. What do you do then? Make sure you have Google AUthenticator backed up or you have the QR codes/token keys. 
There are also alternatives like Authy which have cloud backup of the 2FA keys.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:49:19
I recommend people delete those backups ASAP especially if you've changed passwords, etc. Your weakest link will be a backup with a shitty password. To be extra safe you should also sweep the funds into a new address so that even if they do find your old backup with a crappy password and crack it, at least your funds are in another address.

But every Lyft and Uber driver is a clean cut white collared-looking guy so far I've taken. Many Lyft drivers are overly nice too letting me charge my phone, play whatever music I want, asking if I want to adjust the air, blah blah blah. It's almost creepy.

While 2FA for your email is important, I would disable the auto backup feature. You should backup your wallet manually, and only keep minimal copies around. The issue with the e-mail backups is that if you EVER change the password to your wallet on Blockchain, an older backup still contains the old password. So if you went from a shitty password to a good password, if your old backup lies around, your weakest link is still that bad password.
Manage your backups wisely, and keep only the most current one lying around. I believe Blockchain has backups on their side too so if you ever screw up they can recover those backups for you.

How often does that happen? Honestly, there's not going to be that many times when you buy things online. Maybe once a month? I used to do that with my parents. Ask them for a credit card and tell them what I'm buying. No big deal.


No you don't. You can transfer them money via bank, via check, via PayPal.


You can buy far more things with debit card/credit card than Bitcoin. It sounds like you're more interested in using bitcoin than actually just buying something. If your concern is being able to buy something, you wouldn't have chosen bitcoin to work with as there's tons of methods to get yourself a prepaid card.


PayPal is free to pay friends. PayPal is also free if you use bank transfers.
How old are you? I get it. I may seem like I'm trying to prevent you from buying stuff, but once you turn 18 its pretty easy to get a credit card. And like I said, your parents can set you up with a Visa Buxx or any debit card right now. You should treat bitcoin like something you can use later on, but if your point is to pay for goods online, you should look at getting a prepaid card before you're 18.

As seasoned Bitcoin users, I know it's annoying sometimes to hear people want to learn about something you've studied and followed for years in a 30 second elevator pitch, but honestly that's how the world works.
Bitcoin may be complicated, just like encryption is, but for the public to adopt it, you need to be able to sell it in 30 seconds. Moreover, if you want to get them onboard, you need to be able to teach them in 20 minutes or less (likely 10 minutes even).

It's simple. Right now I can throw my Nexus 5 out the window (while keeping my SIM). I don't even need to go pick it up. I drive home and pick up my Nexus 4, slap the SIM in, install Authy and I'm good to go. I don't even need to look for a slip of paper. The backup loads to my phone.
The slip of paper falls under the same risks with keeping your 2FA on your phone that if you lose your phone, you're screwed. Having a secure cloud backup is the easiest. And even if you put that QR code on a TrueCrypted backup, great. It's still more of a hassle IMO.

Remember, use an app like Authy and not Google Authenticator. Authy has the ability to backup your 2FA codes so if you ever lose your phone or change phones, flash ROMs, whatever, you can recover your 2FA codes.
While this inherently is slightly more insecure, it's very easy to lose a phone, have an OS get corrupt, need to wipe your ROM, etc, so if you lose your Google Authenticator installation, you're SOL. Good luck trying to convince Bitcoin wallets to disable 2FA for you.

Its just so users can transfer files without him getting sent to jail. It so happens his mission should mesh perfectly with those looking for privacy or security given his choice of implementation of zero knowledge.
But yeah, there's better places to store your bitcoin that ARE focused on zero knowledge like Blockchain.

Do you have one time use backup codes for Blockchain, EclipseMC, Coinbase, Facebook, etc that all. One time backup codes are meant to be used when you have no other method of getting a 2FA codes. Having Authy means you can recover your 2FA keys and not have to dig up that paper.
The only time I've had to use that code so far was on vacation in Japan when I wiped my phone for a new ROM and I couldn't authenticate via SMS, nor throw Authy on there. Back then there wasn't Authy for multiple devices yet, so I couldn't just load it up on my tablet for instance.


Are you stupid? Authy uses TOTP, which is the same OPEN SOURCED authentication method that Google published.
Read more: 
You can apply Authy in ANY CASE that you would be using Google Authenticator.
With your fear, Microsoft's own authenticator app must be trash even though it uses the same TOTP authentication methods for Bing accounts.
Furthermore let's not forget Google Authenticator isn't even pin or password protected. Anyone can just open it on your phone. Hooray?
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:12:33
I highly recommend people to use the **Authy** app if you're using TOTP authentication like Google Authenticator. You can add your 2FA tokens that use Google Authenticator to Authy.
Now why is Authy better?
1.  The 2FA tokens are backed up on their servers. If you ever lose your phone, wipe your phone, switch to a new phone, you're covered. Install Authy on the new phone, and voila. It sends a verification SMS, and email, to which you must answer to both. On top of that you encrypt your backup with a passphrase of your choosing, so even if someone steals your SIM card and email, you're still protected. While Gmail has alternative 2FA methods like texting you or even using backup codes, many sites don't have that option. Good luck telling a Bitcoin site to turn off 2FA. That would defeat the purpose. Sites like EclipseMC will wait 30 days before even making a move. So it's to your advantage to have a backup. To me the increased functionality of having a backup far outweighs the slight security risk you're taking. Don't like backups? Fine. Turn it off.
2.  Authy's actually PIN protected. Google Authenticator is not. Anyone can pick up your phone and then bam. Goodbye 2FA codes.
3.  Multi device if you want. Want to have your 2FA codes on your phone AND your tablet? No worries.
4.  Beautiful interface. Holo for Android!
5.  It's zero knowledge encryption. Authy has no knowledge of your password that you encrypt your tokens with. If you lose your password, you're screwed. But that's good for security!
The only advantage I can think of for Google Authenticator is that it supports HOTP which is not as secure. I've only run into once instance where HOTP was required, and that was Eclipse Mining Consortium. They have since changed to TOTP last I checked, so no worries.
@_date: 2014-12-12 13:40:12
Yup. The peace of mind that Authy gives me knowing I can use multiple devices (a slight security compromise) or use cloud backups (a slight security compromise also) is better than the potential threat of losing a phone and losing your 2FA keys too.

Ok have you guys used Eventbrite? I'm not trying to defend them, but realize that the fee is how ~~you~~ they make money. The rest of the ticket sales goes DIRECTLY to the seller. I work with a non-profit and while Eventbrite fees sometimes are meh, they're way better than Ticketmaster, and its a professional front for selling tickets.
I believe the fee structure is 5.5% + $0.99. This is far better than Ticketmaster which is easily 25% of your face value there.
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:45:08
Authy has its own 2FA system as well but its also compatible with TOTP codes so you can have it store tokens that you would normally use Google authenticator for. 
Sorry I'm just advocating for people to use Authy for TOTP codes. Their own 7 digit code could be suspect as you said because I have no idea how those work. I use Authy for Gmail, Facebook, Blockchain, etc

Similarly someone can open Google authenticator on your phone too. This is why I push Authy so hard. It has PIN protection at the very minimum. There are alternatives too, but I find Google Authenticator to just be an incomplete/insufficient app.

I think the fear is that the easiest way to get your hands on a 2FA key is to have the phone in your hand. Sure you could titanium backup it or send some system files over, but all an attacker needs is one glance at the current token and he's in your Coinbase liquidating everything. THAT is the concern.
Some "friend" could just ask "Hey I like your new phone, can I see it?" If he already has your password, bam, your 2FA goes out the door there.
I agree this isn't perfect. To have a more foolproof system, the app itself needs to be encrypted, the tokens are encrypted, your phone is also encrypted, etc. But since all it takes is 1 login session, a one time 2FA code to get your funds, that's why I believe Google Authenticator should have a password. There are alternative apps out there that already include PIN protection. And the reason I'm asking for PIN protection is this is supposed to be a security app. That's different from Gmail or Drive which have multiple uses and are not purely a security app.

The e-mail backup is why 99% of people get hacked on Blockchain. Your e-mail better be damn secure.
You're probably better off taking those private keys and putting them into a BIP38 encrypted printout. Store the PDF in plain view if you want so long as you have a decent BIP38 password.
Edit: What I'm saying is Blockchain is fine, but make sure you purge your e-mail of any old backups with crap passwords. Once you set a solid Blockchain password, you can keep a backup around, but personally I think BIP38 PDF/hard copy is a better go as a backup. I'd be more concerned about my Blockchain backup falling in the wrong hands. BIP38 is solid against brute force.

True, but LastPass is less likely to fall apart than stupid sites like Adobe. If you don't use a password manager, then it's likely you recycle passwords or you use weak passwords. Using a password manager allows you to use 24+ character random passwords on every site, so that if they get compromised, you don't really lose much and your other sites are unaffected.
Sure LastPass is a single point of failure, but you know they're setup well. Plus you can use 2FA on them also for extra security. KeePass and LastPass are zero knowledge systems in that it's fully client side authentication, so if you lose your master password, you're SOL.
@_date: 2014-06-05 01:47:57
Good cold storage is difficult to implement (i.e. Armory). I'm betting a properly managed Blockchain account is better than a typical user who prints out a private key and stores it under their mattress. You're more likely to lose/damage your private key than it is to get your Blockchain (with 2FA and second password) hacked.

I get what you mean, but in this case if the company holds C, it sounds like as long as you provide A or B, you can sign a transaction. What I'm getting at is that if you lose either A or B, you're screwed, but that's just like losing your private key, no? Sure A or B alone does not constitute a private key, but how is C secured? Am I just missing something? Or there's still a login to get to C?

Except all the instances I've seen are people who don't enable 2FA. There's no telling how good their passwords are either. I think my point was strictly regarding the keyloggers issue. I think it's a bit overplayed. If you made a pareto of the causes of lost wallets, it's likely that bad password is the bulk majority of the causes. As to why they're bad passwords, most of those are likely due to poor choice, or because they're reused passwords from some other breach, but very few passwords are stolen via keyloggers.

No there were barely any cops on the ground. The cops were initially prepared to handle the students protesting by surrounding the student union. When the professional protesters (the ones dressed in black, with metal sticks) showed up around 6pm they tore barricades apart, used them as battering rams, shattered windows, set a generator on fire, etc. The cops retreated into the student union, fired some tear gas, etc. but really didn't do much more.
If it was the police, it would be very obvious. They move as a group, in a line, etc. Basically the cops were completely outmaneuvered for the evening and much of the town was attacked.
I saw Bank of America ATMs destroyed, Starbucks and other bank windows shattered, etc. I'm not sure who sprayed her, but it could very well be one of the armed thugs. The news is saying around 150-200 of them showed up. As someone on the ground, it was very noticeable there were different groups of people--students/alums/Berkeley community and these outsider groups who showed up with a clear intent to cause damage.

By professional I mean they know how to go protest and cause trouble. I'd even call them professional rioters. They knew to lash out, cause damage, and then hide back in the protesters crowds.

Is the 2nd password needed if they access your wallet backup? The 2nd password is needed online, but I believe if one of your backups gets leaked, all they need is the single password to get into your funds.
I'd also add that for those using Blockchain to use the browser plugin rather than the website. The website could be compromised at any date and you could be screwed. The plugin along with disabling auto updates is a safer bet.
Also to the haters downvoting, you guys really need to provide rational arguments rather than just always chanting "online = bad, offline = good." I can guarantee you that for most people, offline/paper wallets are riskier simply due to losing the paper or seed.

NFC Payments is overrated. I've had an NFC phone since 2011, but they don't come in handy.
1.  You're going to be standing in line on your phone. Obviously you won't have your Wallet app open already because you're likely going to play games or check e-mail or chat.
2.  When it comes your turn you need to quickly exit that game (oh no critical moment) or finish texting and then switch to your wallet.
3.  Enter your pin, select your card. You could've pulled your wallet out just as fast and selected a card.
4.  Before you bring up that you can have it all ready to go, no games, ready to swipe, well you can also have your CC out in hand ready to pay.
However NFC payments in general will make Bitcoin payments a LOT easier.

If you want something like a 2-of-3 where the service holds 1 of your keys, you can look at Coinbase or BitGo.
Copay is a specific kind of 2-of-3 I don't care much for. I could put 1 on my phone, and another on my computer or tablet. But I find it a little pointless if all I need to do is have my 2 devices in front of me. Personally I find that it's more just increased security in the sense that if I lose my phone I'm not entirely screwed. But that's a different story. I would rather not have a wallet on my phone, on a device I can so quickly lose. Furthermore, Copay works great if you have business partners and you want all of them to approve of transactions for instance, but I find that if I'm the only person who has control over the account, Copay makes less sense.
With that said I've always been a fan of the 2-of-3 service I described above. You can perform 99.99% of your transactions just logging in and the service can't run away with your coins. You can hold a 3rd key in backup so if the service ever dies or runs off, you can still recover your coins.
Is this kind of system bulletproof? No, but it's better than a MtGox situation.

I highly recommend people to use the **Authy** app if you're using TOTP authentication like Google Authenticator. You can add your 2FA tokens that use Google Authenticator to Authy.
Now why is Authy better?
1.  The 2FA tokens are backed up on their servers. If you ever lose your phone, wipe your phone, switch to a new phone, you're covered. Install Authy on the new phone, and voila. It sends a verification SMS, and email, to which you must answer to both. On top of that you encrypt your backup with a passphrase of your choosing, so even if someone steals your SIM card and email, you're still protected. While Gmail has alternative 2FA methods like texting you or even using backup codes, many sites don't have that option. Good luck telling a Bitcoin site to turn off 2FA. That would defeat the purpose. Sites like EclipseMC will wait 30 days before even making a move. So it's to your advantage to have a backup. Don't like backups? Fine. Turn it off.
2.  Authy's actually PIN protected. Google Authenticator is not. Anyone can pick up your phone and then bam. Goodbye 2FA codes.
3.  Multi device if you want. Want to have your 2FA codes on your phone AND your tablet? No worries.
4.  Beautiful interface. Holo for Android!
The only advantage I can think of for Google Authenticator is that it supports HOTP which is not as secure. I've only run into once instance where HOTP was required, and that was Eclipse Mining Consortium. They have since changed to TOTP last I checked, so no worries.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:22:40
That's the authenticator it self not the actual Android app. When you install the Android app or the iOS app, you have NO IDEA that it's being compiled from source, and you have no idea it's using this Google Authenticator source that you showed. Essentially all these cries for open source are just typical FUD that people seem to love to spread.
Why don't you show me how you're going to get into your Blockchain wallet now that you've lost your phone. Please, do tell. This is assuming you don't have a backup copy. Or how about BTC-e.
How is Authy bullshit? You can turn off backups if you want. And even if you use the backup feature, it's very secure.

- Today you can't spend BTC you don't have, but with cash we seem to give people an option to overdraft. If you're smart and make sure you never overdraft, this is not an issue. might help some people out.
- ATM fees. Well, this is why I have a big bank account. Bank of America is everywhere. So is Chase. I look at my wallet regularly and when I'm down to my last $20 bill I go replenish. I try to stick to credit where possible and my friends are usually on Venmo/PayPal so even when we split the check, we usually pay back using online payments. As a result the cash flow is minimized, so I don't need to go to the ATM every few days.
- On top of that I do have a Schwab card which reimburses all fees including international ATMs. I've really only needed it on international trips, but regularly? Just do a good job managing your cashflow.

Dumb clickbait titles like this are not doing society any favors. This exploit was discovered in iOS 9.0.1 and patched in 9.0.2 (1 week in between).
As for decapping, I'm not saying it's not possible, but you risk ruining the whole iPhone and losing the UID forever if you don't do it right. It's far easier from the FBI's perspective to ask for a custom OS (it can be technically done, Apple knows it, we know it). It's a risk free approach for the FBI. I'm not saying what the FBI is doing is right, but if I were in their shoes, the court order for a custom OS is probably the best route to go for them.
It's like would I rather gain access to your computer by having you log in or would I rather disassemble a hard drive that's been wiped 5 times and rely on low level magnetic readings to determine if your randomly written 0s and 1s were always 0s and 1s and trying to figure out what that data used to be?

So I think they were prepared for the students. Usually when the students protest its just sit-ins and they just refuse to move. It usually doesn't get violent.
I think the issue was this Antifa group that showed up. I'm not sure if the cops were prepared but they were definitely undermanned and underprepared. But even if they had enough people I think it would've been tough. This group was totally stealthy. They [were the ones causing damage]( but as soon as the cops would step up they would fade away. Similarly with the other crowds. Occasionally they'd beat someone with their metal sticks, and then run off. I think had the cops gone in to try to grab them they would've just hidden away.
This was pretty bad, and looking back on their Twitter feeds and Facebook groups there were definitely plans for this anarchist group to show up and ruin everything.

Are these instant buys or what?
Buying on debit is always risky from the consumer perspective because it deducts your funds immediately from your bank account. Buying on credit OTOH protects the consumer because you at least have Visa/MC protection for instance where you're not liable for fraudulent charges. Plus, you don't have to pay your bill until your bill cycle is up and then you have a few weeks to pay up. All that time allows you to dispute charges.
Debit does have a benefit (think Square Cash) where you can get instant purchases though, so if there are benefits of having instant buying and withdrawals, then that would be good. Also I'm assuming there are no additional CC fees when using debit?

2.5% is pretty conservative too. A well diversified portfolio can average around 5-6%.
Part of the problem in the US is that people don't save--it's not that they don't know how to or don't have access to resources. When you figure it out, basic budgeting and financial management isn't that hard. With target retirement funds it's even easier now to just start throwing money into a brokerage account and to watch it grow.

While a lot of people talk about Copay for multisig, I'd say it works differently. Or at least Copay is a specific kind of m-of-n wallet where you either authorize multiple devices or people to control keys. Personally, I like the 2-of-3 where you hold 2 of the keys (put 1 in backup) and the server holds another one. That means all your average transactions can be carried out in a web interface while the provider can't just run away with your funds.
Coinkite is more similar to BitGo or Coinbase for a 2-of-3 setup although Coinkite lets you go to m-of-15 and you can get more customized.

[Relevant link]( I'd imagine the Coinbase Vault is still insured. Insurance is negligible for the multi-sig wallet because even if Coinbase were compromised, hackers wouldn't be able to take funds unless they had the 2nd or 3rd keys.
Also people should keep in mind insurance doesn't guard against your own account from being compromised. It's only if there are Coinbase breaches like Bitfinex are you covered. Your own password being shitty and compromised is not covered. Your computer getting hacked via TeamViewer's weaknesses and someone signing into your account doesn't get covered.

I'm no fan of taxes and am fiscally conservative myself, but income tax really isn't 50% at least in the US if you're trying to make that jab about wars. Most people's effective income tax rates are much lower and much lower when you start taking in account for deductions and what not.

Sorry for your loss.
As much as people say to keep stuff off the cloud or avoid hot wallets, this is one of the perils of keeping your own data and running your encryption and the reason why PGP isn't mainstream everyday use stuff. There's risks in managing your own keys.
I'd say this is as important as a lesson as when my Eclipse Mining Guild account was hacked because I had 0.2 BTC stored there from mining. There's risks in both hot accounts and cold storage. Learn to deal with them and protect yourself.

Did you have a credit card or a debit card? Or did you have a really low limit?
I'm not a big spender, but if you want to rely on $800 of credit only for a vacation, that can be risky. You know how you're always supposed to have money for an emergency? Well, what if you did have an emergency? Would $800 be enough? Would you be able to change your flight in case of a family emergency you had to get back to? I'm not sure if the fault is really the credit card.
Let's take a card I have, the Chase Sapphire card. I have $8000 of credit on there. Not huge, but not small either. I'm not going to put $7200 on the card and hope I have enough to survive on my vacation. I'd use a second card if needed.
Sounds to me you have a debit card here, which isn't the wisest thing to use in the first place unless you have difficulty in managing your money properly with credit.




This is why you aren't liable for those charges. Let's say in this month of June you get double charged for a huge charge of $1000. You get 2x $1000 charges on your bill on July 1st, and you say "WTF man, I'm not paying that." Well guess what? You don't have to pay up because your credit card (MC, Visa, Discover, AMEX) all have zero liability protection. You don't have to pay while they are investigating it. So no, you're not spending money you don't have and no one is pulling money from your account without authorization.
Look, there's plenty of reasons to not like credit cards, but I honestly think you maybe didn't manage your personal finances properly to begin with. If you don't want to open up a line of credit, that's fine, because there's plenty of us out there who are enjoying great cashback rewards.

This is true, but this is also how startup mom &amp; pop shops work in NYC. You can quickly start a bakery and sell goods using an iPad (or heck iPhone) with a Square reader. Sure I suppose you can do what fruit stands do and just collect cash, but in modern cities, you're alienating a good chunk of the population by not allowing credit cards.
So yeah I know there's a cost, but you also open the market to a lot of consumers, particularly millennials. Can you imagine opening a new hipster coffee shop that does NOT take card? I probably run into more Square readers than I do even NFC readers.


It varies country to country. That's because in Germany the cash card/debit card network is so strong.
You go to some Asian cities even like Hong Kong, Taipei, or even Tokyo, and you'll see most locals using cash all the time.

I've always said that Bitcoin is mainly for people who have trouble accessing money or being able to transfer money.
If you are a techie in the US like San Francisco, like I am, there's tons of ways to send money to your friends quickly and efficiently. Almost everyone in their 20s and 30s has PayPal, Venmo, Square Cash, or Google Wallet. I can name probably 2 or 3 people tops who would even accept a Bitcoin payment from me, and even if I were asked to be paid Bitcoin for my last Vegas trip with my friends, I'd prefer not to.
As for day to day transactions, living in highly modern cities, credit card is definitely king. Nothing like a quick swipe and I can get my coffee. Square emails me my receipt and I'm on my merry way.
I tend to think Bitcoin might be more useful in less developed areas, but I personally haven't found much use for it besides pseudo-anonymous payments like for VPNs or what not. And also when my friend from abroad had to pay me back for when I paid for some of his stuff when he was visiting, I found Bitcoin useful. Other than that, it's hard to make a case for many residing in 1st world countries.
Don't get me wrong, there's tons of benefits of Bitcoin, being that it's stateless and you essentially have ultimate control over your funds, but from a day to day use perspective? I find it difficult to use regularly still. And just because you can doesn't mean it's actually easier or usable for the mainstream.

I have yet to see a documented case of where a search was performed for no reason. There's always a reason--like the officer smells weed as you roll down the window and you're driving a beat up car with bullet holes in the door. You don't think he'd be a bit suspicious? I'm not trying to justify a seizure here, but what I'm saying is there is some sort of reason. They're not just going to check your wallet or search your house **for no reason at all**
You're right I shouldn't have leapt to the conclusion that if it happens once, it would happen everywhere, but let's be fair, it's hard to believe things happen for **no reason.** Typically that's just an excuse when people don't like what is happening to them.

sure but in most places, everyone's dinner is already marked up, so it only makes sense to use a credit card that gets you rewards.

A double charge on a credit card is not an issue in general. You are not liable if you report it, and you don't have to pay that portion of the bill while it is investigated.
I don't see how this is an issue anyway unless he had only $800 left of credit, which honestly isn't a wise thing to do on vacation anyway. If a double charge puts you at -$42, that suggests the rental is already $842. If his original line of credit was around $1600, then maybe putting an $800+ rental car reservation isn't the smartest thing to do.
**Edit:** Double charge is certainly bad, but on a credit card it can be managed if you proactively monitor your bill. You don't even have to detect it the day it happens--if you catch it before your bill is due, you're not liable. Heck I didn't discover a fraudulent recurring $19.99 charge until 5 months later. I called Chase and they immediately reversed the charges and UPS Next Day shipped a card to me.

Isn't this more of a problem with your bank? I mean no offense to you but frequent travelers would have a card like the Chase Sapphire or Capital One Venture card on them to avoid foreign transaction fees. Of course that's a US perspective, so I'm not sure if it's that easy with other international banks.
While I applaud you for trying to use Bitcoins to get around Kenya, you're mentioning a 5% cut which is more than why my non-foreign friendly credit cards will take, which is 3%. Factor in 1% cashback and I'm really at a net 2% loss only.

That's a reason, not a lack of reason. Saying that things happen for no reason is still just an emotional excuse when they don't like the events that take place. Rather than claiming things happen for no reason, understand what the actual reason is, good or bad.

There is something completely voluntary about being a tax slave. **You can leave the country that is making you pay taxes.** Most of society has accepted that there are some rights you give up for the well being of society, and paying taxes is one of them.
Also the analogy with McDonalds has nothing to do with your choice of going to McDonalds or not.

My point is you weren't paying attention if you think no one knew what the hell Bitcoin was. I don't know when you discovered Crypto but it certainly sounds like it was recent, which was why someone said this to you:


The fact is Bitcoin got a lot of huge coverage in mainstream media before, and just because YOU discovered it today doesn't mean everyone else did. Look, I'm not trying to say everyone knows what Bitcoin is. It has plenty of room to grow especially for mainstream adoption. Even the people who know about it see it as a black box they don't understand.
My point was that everytime we have one of these surges, whether it's 2011, 2012, 2013, 2017, etc. there have been massive spikes in adoption. Stop using your experience as some sort of benchmark for global adoption because not only does Bitcoin have a long way to go, but people have been saying this with each surge since forever that "Oh now people know what it is because its popularity is so widespread now." And if you don't think the SEC wasn't paying attention, [the 2013 hearing was covered on MSM and TV.]( And if people didn't know about that, they also likely didn't know about the 2018 SEC hearings either. Most people don't know about most SEC hearings anyway.

Sure. There's plenty of people who got lucky investing a shit ton of money into AAPL, TSLA, AMZN, etc. but there's also tons of people who lost plenty of money with such strategies with other stocks.
What you should do is at least focus on building a solid and safe plan for retirement, meaning stick to strategies that work to give you the foundation you need. If you have extra money or are young still, you can afford some extra risk. Maybe the extra $$ you have can go into riskier stuff.
What's dumb is pointing to the exceptions where people made it rich by not following conventional wisdom and expecting everyone else to be that successful.

I acknowledged web wallets have disadvantages. There's security issues with every wallet out there. A web wallet can steal your money, but has there even been a **confirmed case** where Blockchain.info actually stole someone's money? No one would be using it if that was the case.
Mobile wallets that are seed based have their issues too. Does everyone ensure their smartphones are locked down with passcodes (not PINs) and have anti-theft software enabled on all their devices? Given how often cell phones are lost, there's a significant risk there.
Let's not even forget those seeds. Where do people store them? In an email to themselves? On a post-it?
Look my point isn't to say a web wallet is safer than a hardware wallet. That's not my point. My point is that in general a web wallet isn't inherently as bad as most people make it out to be. Blockchain.info isn't there to steal your funds. The talk of keyloggers and malware is typically overstated--show me a confirmed case where a keylogger compromised someone's wallet? IT really comes down to the user, and almost in all cases, it comes back to getting phished or using a shitty password to begin with.
Blockchain.info actually has a lot more security than most web logins. Not only is there the obvious 2FA, you have the option of a second password, which is essentially double encrypting your wallet. Finally, all new logins need to be authorized via email. I have yet to see a documented and confirmed case where someone taking all these security measures are actually getting hacked.

I think people mix up short term success with long term retirement investments. You put money in 401ks and IRAs for your long term retirement. They have proven track records and most 401k providers give you a selection of funds that are medium risk at best. The idea is that if you put $200k away throughout your lifetime, that it will still be there when you retire and has grown to an appreciable amount.
Sure you could put $200k into Bitcoin a few years back and be a billionaire today, but there are thousands of other "investments" out there that didn't make it. That's what makes it speculative. Bitcoin got successful. Most other investments did not. The same goes with the arguments about startups. Facebook did well. 99% of other startups do not.

Web wallets have their disadvantages true, but Blockchain.info can be used pretty responsibly. I stored funds on there for years without issues. Most of the issues I see really come down to the user:
- Password reuse
- Backups to unsafe Gmail/Drive accounts
- Phishing
- Bad password choice to begin with
- No 2FA
I personally don't like Electrum as they don't use the BIP39 standard.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:32:13


You can have full control of your keys even using Blockchain.info. The newer seed version is a bit different (can anyone confirm if it's BIP39 seed?).
My understanding with the old version was that Blockchain.info generated the keys, then encrypted them and stored them server side. You were free to export the keys and back them up locally too. You can have full control that way.
Blockchain.info serves like a Dropbox or Drive to store your wallet, except the wallet is fully encrypted/decrypted client side.
Almost every single instance of Bitcoin being stolen from Blockchain has been from the following instances:
- Bad password use -- if you use "123456" anyone can just start guessing wallet logins using a list of email addresses.
- Backup to insecure Drive/Dropbox accounts. Early versions of Blockchain had auto backup features where every change you made they'd email or upload to a linked cloud account of yours. If your logins to Gmail or Dropbox are insecure, you're screwed.
- Getting phished. This is more recent with fake Blockchain.info links. Do people really forget the website that easily? Do you forget your bank's website and other critical logins where you search them on Google **and then** click on the Ad link?
My point isn't that Blockchain.info can't be used. They can, but you have to be smart too. It's not some sort of leaking site that gets hacked 24/7. Users are stupid, and if you think you can be very good without making mistakes, then Blockchain.info can be used.

I definitely have this set up, but like I said, it's concerning that fiat-based services like PayPal, or any major bank will kick you off their site, even though you're far more protected to begin with. Heck even your credit card, that most people consider very safe, will kick you off their site after a few minutes of inactivity.
That alone should tell any Cryptocurrency site to do the same, especially one linked to your bank account.
@_date: 2015-08-01 20:02:26


This is the problem though. Most users aren't aware of that. This is why 2FA via Google Authenticator isn't the absolute mainstream. Sure cryptocurrencies are using it but when you hit up  the majority of major institutions like banking etc are using SMS or their own proprietary systems.
Google Authenticator IMO is the best, but without a solid backup tool its difficult to use. I'm big with Android ROMs so I have system images and Titanium Backups galore, but I don't see how the average user will know how to do this. They probably just scan the QR code at the beginning and that's it. Do they know to save the QR code or 2FA seed?
You argue that Google backing them up defeats the purpose, but it does not. I think a cloud backup (especially if you can do it as zero knowledge encryption as Authy claims) is an effective way to get people on the 2FA train to use Google Authenticator. Remember--2FA isn't meant to be bulletproof. It's meant to be a SECOND form of authentication such that you need 2 forms to authenticate and login.
Look at how many reports there are with people who lost their phones and can never get into accounts again. That's the kind of user unfriendliness that will make people shy away from Google Authenticator or 2FA in general. This is the same problem with Bitcoin. If you make security and usability consistently hard for average users to grasp, then its going to be hard to take off. I think of myself as generally tech-capable considering I've done Android development, and while getting into the nitty gritty of Bitcoin is possible for me, I'd rather not have to go through all that just to understand how to properly secure my funds. Your average Joe doesn't want to figure out how to backup authenticator codes either.
For now I'd recommend people to use Authy. Sure its a cloud backup system that could be insecure, but they claim its locally decrypted. Plus you need to confirm either via SMS or eMail or a second device (If you enable multi device) to add a new device to the account. And only then can you download the encrypted blob which you must decrypt locally. This might not fit the threat model of a tinfoil hatter, but IMO it fits the bill for most average users.

The bubble exposed companies that were poorly run. Also keep in mind both of these companies weren't even all that amazing in 1999. Amazon maybe because e-Commerce was new but look at its recovery. Amazon didn't really start majorly rising until its services sector took off.
In most of the 2000s, Amazon was just another e-Tailer. Sure it was doing better than the rest, but nothing new. After Prime really took off and all its other services started taking off (AWS, streaming, etc.) then the company started rising. Similarly, Apple didn't really start gaining much up until the iPod product took the industry by force, and then once again even bigger was the iPhone launch.

Keep in mind that Apple's 1999/2000 bubble was also when it wasn't doing so well. Keep in mind that when you look at the company today, the vast majority of its revenues comes from phone which didn't launch til 2007 not to mention that the smartphone market didn't balloon into the size it is today until at least 2012.
[A quick look at this graph tells you the story]( and it starts in 2009 too. I can't imagine what the pre-iPhone times looked like. Apple stayed pretty flat until MP3 players became all the rage in 2004-2005 or so. The iPod became so mainstream by then. Amazon didn't really take off til post 2008 recession either, so yes the 99-2000 bubble is in retrospect not a huge issue, but the industry today is far different than it was in the late 90s. Your traditional industry players like Cisco, Intel, AMD, IBM, HP were the ones that rallied big time in the 90s. The dominant forces in the market are far different today (Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Google). CSCO and MSFT are pretty obvious--you made your fortunes in the 90s and ever since the 2000s they've never been the same. That's far different than Apple which faced the dark ages in the 90s and didn't do a huge run until much later.

Authy is closed source so that may be a dealbreaker for some, but honestly IMO its better than Google authenticator by far.
The biggest problem I see with GAuth is that people lose their phones or wipe their phones and lose their 2FA keys. Bitcoin wallet operators are not just going to disable 2FA for you and nor do you want that to happen as it would be a potential way to socially engineer access.
Authy does well in that its supposedly zero knowledge where all encryption/decryption is done locally. Furthermore, you need to confirm either via SMS/E-Mail or a second device if you intend on adding a device on. There's a password that you then must enter after the blob is downloaded to your device so you can decrypt the backed up authenticator accounts.
It's a very simple to use solution that will allow you to securely retain your 2FA keys.
And remember, 2FA isn't meant to be bulletproof. It's meant to add a second factor. Even if Authy is somehow hacked or its lying about being zero knowledge, remember your password needs to be strong enough.

It took me a full month.
- Submitted on March 17th
- Followed up on March 23rd: Got the typical "we're overloaded excuse."
- Followed up on April 4th: Got another "sorry we're really overloaded."
- Followed up on April 18th: Got a response saying everything was approved on March 22nd.
- I replied saying no way, and showed them a screenshot of the funding (ACH) screen requiring ID documents
- No reply on April 19th, so I sent a follow up
- Response on April 20th says that my ACH account isn't linked up. Within a minute I get another approval email saying my ID documents are finally approved.
- I login to see my Bank Account is already setup and linked (I logged in to my Bank via Gemini before), so I bought $20.
1. Pretty disappointed in their slowness
2. Being overwhelmed with a queue for a month is unfortunate, but after a certain point you should be warning customers on your website or something.
3. They gave me a few BS responses saying my ID was already approved (if it was, then you should apologize that I still can't buy), and after that they said my bank account wasn't linked when it was actually. That not only shows incompetence but an obvious attempt to cover up their slowness.
4. For all the shit Coinbase gets, their support has been top notch for me and Gemini is purely amateur from my experience.

I'm not doubting it's not hard to steal info through a rooted phone, but once again how many people even care about bitcoins on XDA-Developers much less are aiming to steal bitcoins? Most people stick with big name developers like CyanogenMod or Paranoid Android or Exodus. While it's completely possible something is bundled in the open source OSes, it's highly unlikely that's what's happening. And why stop at bitcoins? Tons of other things would be compromised as well.
I feel like most people are focusing on the attack vectors that are less likely to be the case even if it is possible.

Thank you. I had to scroll this far down to find it. KYC/AML really only kick in when you start dealing with fiat. Anyone can create a wallet today and claim they don't need to operate within KYC/AML regulations. Bitaddress.org or BitcoinPaperWallet.com could say that today easily.

No I did not, but I'm trying to point out that they might be having issues. For users who just want a wallet that works and not have to worry about 6 months that the project is abandoned, then yes, this is something to look out for. Meeting your committed deadlines is certainly a metric for evaluating an app.
I'm not trying to say they're bad. The developer's been pretty helpful in troubleshooting bugs, but can I say I'm a little worried they might not be getting as far along as they might want to?
Don't get me wrong, there's tons of "projects" out there outside of Bitcoin that look cool (take a look at Indiegogo/Kickstarter). Not all of them succeed and there's a reason 90% of startups just end up folding. I don't think I'm being unreasonable in wanting a reliable wallet when it comes to hosting my money. It's part of the reason why people trust big banks. They're too big to fail.

Because ultimately some people need to convert it to fiat for whatever purposes they need? I get that Bitcoin is a great idea, but until everyone can use it like your local currency, there's going to be people who need to convert back and forth.
That 1% fee here and there for converting back and forth then again a transaction fee + delay is going to turn people off. I understand users here including myself might be fine with it, but to introduce people into Bitcoin saying this is THE way to transfer money and all other ways suck isn't helping the cause. Keep in mind not every where in the world is it that easy to convert BTC to fiat and vice versa.

Hence HODL! So if anything it might be worth just investing and not touching. But that has its own risks right? The way I see it is my Bitcoin savings are completely not being touched right now. I keep that completely separate from my desires to spend, but with that said my desires to spend would be more for the purposes that Bitcoin has to offer like anonymity. So for instance, buying a VPN, I would make an effort to buy Bitcoins and then pay for the VPN, but that's because I want the anonymity aspect.
For other things like buying Gyft cards or Steam purchases, I feel less inclined to use Bitcoin because there isn't the benefit there. Plus with 5% Cashback on Gyft using Chase Ink, how could I resist?

I know a lot of blame is going to point at Blockchain, but let me just remind everyone that most of the flaws where coins were actually compromised as a result of BC.info's bad practices were refunded and they were helpful about it.
But let's look at possible ways your coins can get compromised. I don't think these are really faults of Blockchain.info but more just bad practices in a user's own management of their Bitcoin wallet:
1. Make sure you have 2FA on. But 2FA is no excuse for a weak password. If your password is compromised already, then you're really hoping that 2FA keeps your coins alive.
2. Keep track of where the backups go. By default back in the day, BC.info would email you a backup after each change. Is your email secure? Do you use a strong password? 2FA? There's also options to upload to Dropbox and Google Drive. Same questions arise. Do you protect those accounts well too? If you have an offline backup did you leave it anywhere insecure? Is your computer locked down?
3. Even if you change your password to Blockchain.info, old wallet backups are still encrypted by an old password. What you should do as you upgrade your security to your Blockchain.info account is when you add a password or second password, to sweep all your funds into a new address. Consider the old addresses compromised.
4. Don't log into BC.info on a public computer. Consider the risks of keyloggers, etc.
1, 2, and 3 are almost always how people get compromised. And that's not really Blockchain's fault. You need to understand the level of security needed here.
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:51:41
But that suggests your own computer or sync accounts were also hacked. But honestly this is a risk with any browser based application. Expect your browser to cache stuff and store it on your computer. If you really need to use a browser session, consider Incognito mode or something where the data is erased afterward or perhaps a LiveCD session like Tails off of a USB stick or whatever.

I'm a huge Android fan although I carry both devices. Android is just not there in terms of security. Apple devices have had dedicated hardware encryption since the 3GS.
Android devices still lack this and therefore rely on slow software encryption. What's more is the secure enclave of Apple devices makes it such that your brute forcing must be done on the device it self, meaning that brute forcing from a remote device is practically impossible.
Android has a lot of catching up to do in terms of security still.

While that is true, most instances of coins losses were related to:
- backups being stored insecurely
- bad passwords
- no 2FA
- emails hacked
Coins that were lost because of BC.info were mostly restored and they were generally helpful about it. This could've been a hot wallet with the best internal security practices and someone would still lose their coins.
The reason you don't hear this much on Coinbase is because there's forced 2FA.
@_date: 2016-02-17 20:04:02
Those were the SSL keys. They realized there's no way to get the data at rest, so they'd have to build in some sort of hijacked login page with a fake cert to capture that data.
Basically the feds wanted a backdoor, and Lavabit said no. While Apple can do this because they're big, wasn't Lavabit wanted because of Snowden? I doubt Apple would be able to resist so easily if there was a high value target on the line.

That's a bad analogy. Not everyone is using Bitcoin to hide their transactions. And Bitcoin isn't fully anonymous anyway. It's pseudoanonymous.
Privacy is good, but if your goal is to be fully anonymous then you better tell me you're on VPN + Tor + public WiFi network with a computer you paid for with cash where you wore a mask at the exchange. Also you better not be using Bitcoin and should be on Monero instead.
Look, the point is people have different privacy needs. Just because Coinbase isn't anonymous doesn't mean you shouldn't use it.

Honestly the password doesn't need to be too complicated. Your entropy is mainly coming from the 12 - 24 seed words anyway.
You can use a password you're familiar with. Remember, the big thing about BIP39 passwords is that any entry will generate a valid wallet. So what I recommend doing is take your 24 words, put some mBTC in, and then put your main funds in the 24 words + BIP39 passphrase. This way if you get forced into disclosing your seed words via rubber hose cryptography, you have plausible deniability. Hand over the seed words, and they see the few bits in your wallet and walk away with it. Meanwhile, you still have your actual wallet hidden away.
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:03:03
I get that it's easy to laugh at these phrases in the era of Snowden, but what genuinely do you have to fear about opening up a new credit card account--since we're talking US let's talk about the popular credit cards like Chase Sapphire Reserve or AMEX Platinum. 
What do you really fear from these corporations? If it's about being tracked or companies selling your data, there's a reason consumer and privacy laws exist. And while they may not be perfect Bitcoin isn't fully anonymous either. What protections exist for the consumers who are buying Bitcoin out there at exchanges? Or what about Localbitcoins? Trusted buyers/sellers provide proof of identity. What prevents LocalBitcoins from putting together a profile and selling that? I'm fairly certain Chase or Bank of America have far more restrictions on what they can do with your personal information than what Local Bitcoins can do.
I'm not trying to say credit card good, bitcoin bad, but we ought to stop looking at this as everything in the fiat world being evil.

If you break down taxes to "taking your money" then you could say the same about anything.

We all pay taxes because we agree collectively as society, we want the government to provide some basic needs to us, like common defense, clean water, police protection, fire protection, etc.  That's fine if you want to be one of those stupid [Sovereign Citizen idiots]( then go ahead, but I can bet you most of the educated world doesn't believe in that.

There's a difference between banking grade security for Bitcoin where once your coins are compromised, they can no longer be recovered compared to a fiat banking system today where you at least have some recourse if your account was hacked.
As much as we hate Bank of America, PayPal, Chase, etc. there is at least a finite chance of you getting your money back. Heck my friend's remote desktop got hacked and he had his PayPal account drained but he eventually got the money back. More simple hackings where a Chinese IP logs into your US account are almost always recovered.
So yes closed source secure elements can only go so far. Because you have no other safety net when it comes to Bitcoin.

At least allowing the option for an alphanumeric password or fingerprint would be nice.
Also their [Tweet about giving Google fingerprints]( is absolutely a complete misunderstanding of how the fingerprint API works and how the secure enclave on Android devices works. It's quite similar on the iOS side with Apple's Secure Enclave, and there are white papers detailing how it works and how the fingerprint data is kept solely on the device and can never be read by anyone including Apple/Google. Makes you wonder when even privacy focused apps like Signal have already implemented fingerprint APIs.

From a devil's advocate point of view though, no backdoor would just expose the private key. If one were to be implemented, I'm sure the actual private key would be guarded by layered/credential-based access.
Think of how Google and Apple works--they undoubtedly can assist law enforcement when a court order comes to reveal data in the cloud account. Yet there's massive privacy aspects if one of their sysadmins can just get in and read your emails. They don't just let any Google employee read emails. That's why there's probably some level of access-based control to provide that data to law enforcement when required.
But yes, backdoors are a terrible idea because of the reasons you posted.

2. You have a copy of your 2FA seeds somewhere.

Yeah I hate this whole bashing on different generations. Take a step back and recognize that the trends are typical. Older generations complain younger generations don't have their shit together, and younger generations think older generations need to die now as they're crazy.
Let's just keep in mind there's plenty of millennials out there who are living with great careers. I'm totally biased living in the Silicon Valley, but when you see new grads raking in $150k+ salaries, maybe we should stop generalizing that they are living paycheck to paycheck. Yeah maybe the people who majored in ethnic studies and have no clue what to do in life.

Where do you keep it then? In your head? On a piece of paper? There's attack vectors regardless. If you keep it somewhere inconvenient, you could lose that physical seed and then what?
The benefit of cloud is that you can easily access something. To me that's far better than losing something physically as its already easy enough to misplace a piece of paper.
There are steps you can take to secure things. Obviously don't reuse passwords. Evernote has 2FA also.

There's some discussion here: 
Also IIRC there was some polling and data aggregation of new grads getting offers from the famous tech companies (Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc.) along with salaries, equity pay, etc.
And FWIW I work in Silicon Valley. I'm fairly familiar with what are reasonable salaries. $150k isn't just base. Usually base is around $100k as you see in the Quora thread but when you add in bonuses and equity, it's easily 150k.
**Edit:** Here's the [article I mentioned earlier]( There's a link to the spreadsheet of data too.
**Edit 2:** Reddit has [some discussion too](
**Edit 3:** Reading these threads makes me sad I didn't go into CS. These starting salaries are absolutely absurd compared to what I graduated with.

I would never keep a 24 word seed in the cloud unencrypted. If you're going to do that at least ensure your cloud provider encrypts, and you use a unique/strong password to protect it + 2FA. I would recommend people to perhaps put a client side encrypted seed in the cloud just in case you ever forget it. To me an encrypted seed is a far more durable in the cloud than it is on a piece of paper. It's the same reason why KeePass is secure even though it uses Dropbox or Google Drive

You do have to provide your address. You end up hiding your real CC  but that isn't really that big of a deal.
Honestly, virtual CCs aren't private at all. They just prevent your real CC# from getting compromised. This comes from the early 2000s or late 90s where people thought online shopping = stuff compromised. Before sites properly used HTTPS, SSL, etc your data could potentially get sent in the clear, but even with CC liability protection, virtual CCs are overblown. It's kinda why amongst the big banks, only Citi continues to offer it (they had offered it many years ago to begin with), but many others don't. It's just not that valuable.

We may be at a peak right now but even looking at someone [who invests at the worst possible times]( you'd be well ahead.
I'm not against crypto at all. I think many people got very fortunate with crypto and it's bound to grow even more in the next few years. With that said, don't just shit on good personal finance practices because you hit it rich in Bitcoin. It's just as easy for someone from a different perspective to feel that way too. There's many people who got lucky investing in Cisco or Microsoft in the 80s, or similarly people who invested in Apple in the 2000s, or Tesla in 2012. Yeah, those people made good decisions, or perhaps got lucky, but you can't always count on that. Bitcoin could die tomorrow for all we know.

To be fair 2FA via SMS is still better than no 2FA.
Google Authenticator is definitely a step up but it's not that user friendly. What happens if you lose your phone? Sites like Google and Microsoft have 2FA via SMS fallback. Same with Apple and iCloud accounts. If you backup your 2FA via Authy then you increase the surface of attack. There's no perfect mechanism, and the safest ways are likely the least user friendly ways like PGP where if you lose your key you're fucked.
Many crypto sites that use 2FA don't even have SMS fallback because they're international. What's the fallback for people losing their phones then? It's social engineering. Mining pools like EclipseMC and even Blockchain.Info's web wallet had this issue where you could email them and beg them to disable 2FA if you lost your phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Coinbase has something similar.

[Yes I'm certain it's falling as the tech industry is booming and salaries continue to increase](
There are other ways to increase your pay:
1. Ask for a raise.
2. Look for another job. A new position at a new company is an excellent way to get a promotion AND a raise.
3. Look to advance your career. This gets into the realm of career counseling, but look at how you can go further. As an engineer, one can look at if they want to go the route of management, or further develop themselves into an SME to be an individual contributor, or look at the business side of things. If you're in blue collar labor, look at how you can potentially develop your skills further so you aren't just a McDonalds worker.
If you're just going to sit by while ~2% inflation overtakes you and just cry about it on then perhaps you're taking poor care of your finances. It's one thing to be in continuous debt and struggle to make ends meet, but we're clearly not talking about that right now.
I get that it's cool on to shit all over fiat and inflation, but most adults of the developed world see taking care of your finances similar to taking care of your health or hygiene. It's basic shit that you need to nail down as a responsible human being.

Debit card fees have been very low to begin with, which is why my point is that what Circle is doing isn't too good to be true. Other companies like Venmo, Square, Google, PayPal have been doing this for years--link your bank account or debit card and you can fund your account for free.
What's too good to be true would be if Circle allowed for 0% fees for Credit Card buys. Now THAT would be huge.

Well if it's obvious then the patents won't be granted--in which case people are free to use them however they want.
If it's granted... well remember the US has a first-to-file system, so if you want douchebags like [this guy]( holding on to your Bitcoin patents, well then let Coinbase sit idly by for the patents to be scooped up. In my mind it's at least better for a company like this to hold the patents. Like others said--these patents are only nefarious if Coinbase refuses to allow anybody else to use them. I can't think of anyone else better to apply for these patents than Coinbase currently.

Shrug. Honestly, if you want a bulletproof solution, most people aren't going to be able to use it. Even paper wallets with BIP0038 are vulnerable to basic issues like losing your damn wallet or forgetting the passcode. Same with HD wallets with a seed phrase--most people probably write it down and that's just as insecure if that paper is floating in your house.
Coinbase offers a solid solution for those who want to be able to log in and have quick access to their funds. I don't consider myself stupid, but even Coinkite needs more than a basic understanding of 2-of-3 to setup properly.

Should note that the benefit of Debit card means instant transfers in and out. The well known PayPal and Venmo scams take advantage of ACH delays so the overdraw doesn't hit you til later. Then at that point Venmo/PayPal freeze your account because someone sent you a fraudulent payment.
By integrating a debit card, you get an instant authorization via the debit network. So if someone is trying to overdraw to scam you, it will decline. At least that's theory. Supposedly that's why people are liking Square Cash because you don't even need to hold a balance in Square Cash by using a Debit Card.
@_date: 2015-09-10 01:23:00
How did you get your money locked up for 180 days? What did you do? I know there are a lot of PayPal horror stories. I've used PayPal for 12 years now with tons of transactions with no problems.

I believe the flaw was that addresses were not truly randomly generated.
Honestly, there's not that high of a risk your funds are compromised on Blockchain. If you don't trust their generator, use Bitaddress to generate a Public Key/Private key pair and then upload it to Blockchain so you have it in the cloud.
Almost all those hackings you see on are due to bad password choice or their emails getting hacked. If you have a pretty solid security system for your passwords, you should be OK.
That said, would I put my life savings in Blockchain? Probably not, but knowing how you can set it up securely, I'd be ok with $10k.

People should NOT use Blockchain like a cold wallet. Only put as much funds as you would carry in your regular wallet.

The example from the US I'm thinking of is the [Schwab Debit Card]( that comes with your Investor Checking Account. All your fees are reimbursed every month and there's no foreign transaction fees. The way I use it is I fly to China with $0 on me, land, walk to the ATM and pull out some cash so I can buy street food, pay for my driver to take me to my hotel, and that's it. It was scary the first time doing it so I kept a bit of USD on me just in case, but since then I've found it to be a reliable way of going out of the country.
On top of that packing my Chase Sapphire Reserve and usually a backup Discover card usually gets me through trips. Of course it depends on where you go as certain places in Asia, cash is king.

You can alternatively generate addresses on Bitaddress or some other generator and import those keys into Blockchain.
As for the encrypted copy of your private key being brute forced, well use a good password right? The people who get hacked so far have reused passwords or used shitty passwords. I have yet to hear someone who uses a 12+ character random password + 2FA get hacked on Blockchain.


Same problem exists with GreenAddress and any online wallet. I understand an online wallet has its limits, but that's why they have a Chrome App (Both GreenAddress and Blockchain). Isn't the wallet app itself open source? You can build your own if you want.
Furthermore, you can always export a wallet and keep the private key yourself or store it in a BIP00038 format.


I have yet to hear of any confirmed cases of keyloggers compromising a Bitcoin wallet. There are thousands of other things typical keylog attacks go after. And while this is brought up millions of times as a possible threat vector, no one has been able to prove that this has been a point of failure in Blockchain wallet compromises. Almost all of them are due to bad password choice, backups being stored improperly, email being compromised.

Yeah but the state department's security practices are why you WANT government email there. Even if it isn't the best, the idea is to use a regulated service. That way if the government needs to upgrade its security, you're not going to be left behind because you're on a private server.
The same argument applies for any Fortune 500 company. Whos going to let you use your Gmail? Even if Gmail is more secure than your idiotic IT department's home brewed solution, the idea is that companies need to invest in their own security. That way at least everyone meets a minimum security level and you're not using something that could be potentially less secure.

The part that is not emphasized enough is the password.
You can generate an HD wallet with password or no password or any password. The point is even if your 12 words are leaked, you're protected behind a password. That's huge.
It also helps you with plausible deniability. Put in $10 in BTC in the first address of the HD Wallet with your 12 word seed. Then put your remaining funds in the HD wallet that is secured by a BIP39 passphrase. Make sure you practice opsec in splitting funds--heck just go buy some BTC off Coinbase now and transfer it to that wallet you will give up under duress. The rest of your funds can stay hidden.

You know you can disable 2FA in a lot of services without actually having to confirm anything--Kraken isn't alone. The idea is you secure your login first before you complain. You didn't secure your login and you got hacked. Simple as that.
Your 2FA got disabled for withdrawals not because Kraken sucks, but because your own login got hacked. Had you turned on 2FA for logins that would've helped a bit.

I'd argue theft is a huge issue with a hardware wallet. I still prefer a seed. And once you load up your software wallet, your phone essentially becomes a "hardware wallet." So your best way to go about your day is to separate your spending wallet with your savings wallet.
Your savings wallet should probably not only be seed based but also have a BIP39 passphrase that's stored separately from the seed (in your head)

Here's my experience with both exchanges during March:
**Coinbase:** I tried to buy but they froze my buys. I replied to the email as suggested in the freeze email. No response after 3 days. So I opened a ticket manually and they responded in 7 hours. What happened? I had entered my bank's name in the name field when linking my bank account. Oddly this was never an issue when I bought coins in 2014. Immediately after the response, I fixed my name, and in less than an hour they re-enabled my buys.
**Gemini**: I tried to link ACH on March 16th or 17th but saw I couldn't so I submitted my ID (I have PDF copies of my DL and passport ready to go for things like this). Nothing after a week--told me they were too busy. Nothing after 2.5 weeks. Finally 5 weeks in I asked in an angry email WTF is going on. They told me that I was verified within 5 days. I told them that was a load of crap because I had emailed them twice and they told me they were too busy both times and I needed to keep waiting. A little while later on the same day I got an email saying I was verified. Only then could I buy on Gemini.
Honestly now that I'm good to go on both exchanges they work fine, but Gemini was way overloaded and not only that they covered up their incompetence by lying to me saying I was approved and good to go.
With that said I think Coinbase/Gdax security is funny--how can a site where you buy Bitcoins keep you permanently logged in. No fiat banking site including PayPal, Venmo, etc will ever do that

Don't a lot of US banks have a bunch of fees now? However honestly if you got in before the 2008 crisis, chances are you have some no fee checking out there.
I have some no fee checking from Bank of America provided that it auto transfers $25 to my savings every month. No big deal.
Chase is a bigger PITA though in that I need to maintain a balance of $5k if I don't do anything. I may consider closing that down. Ally and HSBC don't have any fees for me IIRC.
Honestly, in countries where its very easy to transfer money between accounts and individuals, Bitcoin has a hard time. How do I convince friends to jump on Bitcoin when they use PayPal, Venmo, Square Cash to transfer money to friends so easily and without hassle?
It's in developing countries where you lack the infrastructure to transfer money easily where Bitcoin has a solid chance.

I started with BoA, then got a second account at WaMu because of its convenience with free checks. It migrated me to Chase and I just let some cash sit in there. I could close it too as the $5k minimum for no fee is a bit annoying.
As for HSBC? That's because I had a high interest savings account at some point in time. It's just sitting open and its fee-less, but I have since moved to Ally for the higher interest rate.
It's not that big of a deal to have multiple bank accounts unless they're all charging me a monthly fee.

I think you're probably in a tiny minority. Millions of people cross the border every year whether its flying or by land or sea, and I'd venture to guess that less than 1% have their phones, laptops, etc. confiscated and searched. I'm not trying to justify the government's actions, but at the same time, it isn't right to tell everyone to live in fear that your data could be seized any moment.
There's a lot of things the government can technically do. Like you could be whisked away and taken to a black site any second and tortured the hell out of. While we can protest for an end to interrogations using torture, I don't think it's practical for everyone to fear living expecting that to happen to them at any moment.

They're using 12 character passwords and not using symbols. Could be better I suppose.
That should not be the default password policy because I use 20+ character randomly generated passwords. What is needed is sensible password entropy checks disallowing dictionary words and forcing a certain length and complexity.
This password actually appears weaker than all the rest of my passwords. What they should've done was forced a reset with stringent requirements for new passwords.

I think the point is large transactions occur on a daily basis. There's 330 million people who live in Europe using the Euro, which is slightly bigger than the population of the US. 
Really there should be no reason to fear for transferring sums of money up to 100k EUR. I get that the US is different, but it's similar in that transactions above $10k get flagged and reported, but stuff like this happens every day. People split rent payments, people do business transactions, etc.
I mean honestly I think there's more to this story that we're not getting--just buying and selling Bitcoin itself isn't illegal. There has to be some part I'm missing.
I'll post from the US POV, but if I'm going to sink in $1k at Coinbase, and turn it into $10k through price inflation and cash out, there's really no issue. Hundreds if not thousands of people have transferred large sums with no issue.
Now let's try to look at it from a different perspective. Say you're using coins that are associated with some crime--like some child porn ring got busted and you bought coins from them. You then send the money to Coinbase and then cash out. Yeah perhaps the feds will come knocking and figure out what's up with that.
This is why you need to be careful. Buy and sell through reliable legal mediums. If you're going to do anything shady and it's directly linked to your identity, you likely can and will be questioned. OP should lawyer up honestly.

You realize it's not as simple as simply always siding with the customer. Credit cards have a zero liability clause too meaning they always side with the customer.
I agree PayPal has had their problems, but also realize PayPal is used in a lot of very informal transactions (think eBay, Craigslist, classifieds) that commonly run into these issues. You see big retailers also use PayPal like B&amp;H Photo Video, Walmart, Best Buy, etc. If they're just taking massive losses all the time they wouldn't take PayPal.

I posted this before but insurance for coins on Coinbase is far different than insurance for USD. The US financial regulations protect holding fiat to the point where you're totally covered. In most cases involving fiat it is very possible to get your money back even if someone hacks your account and sends USD out. Transactions can be reversible by banks and what not.
With Bitcoin the situation is very different. The insurance covers if Coinbase as a whole has issues, not if you have a crappy login and your login is compromised. Read this directly from Coinbase:

Here's the thing--your price whether you pay credit card, cash or Bitcoins is the same pretty much. Cash discounts do exist in some places like gas stations, but in general you're not allowed to increase price for credit cards.
Of course there's a cost. There's the banks to extend you a line of credit which you could potentially default on. That's how the world works. As an exchange you get perks like these, and also the perk of not having to hit the ATM every week to get more cash. If you live in high tech areas like San Francisco, you can easily get away not spending a dime of cash for weeks.
You're right the credit card companies do sell your purchase history, but it's important to understand how it works. The data is anonymized and it's typically done as an aggregate, meaning they know a lot of people in a certain area like to buy McDonalds or whatever. Is it good? No, but it's a tradeoff.
I'm not saying Bitcoin is bad, but honestly a lot of hate for banks and credit cards come from people who don't even know how to manage credit wisely. Millions if not billions use credit cards just fine every day.

Maybe you can put like 0.1 BTC in your 12 word seed wallet with no password, but then put the real funds in the 12 word seed wallet + passphrase.

Joking aside I had an issue in March with Coinbase that was resolved in 7 hours. I got the initial response in ~6.5 hours and then I did what I needed to do and they fixed the issue by the 7th hour.
The issue specifically was that I was blocked from buying all of a sudden. The issue ended up being that when I initially set up my ACH link in Coinbase (wayyyyy back in the day), I had put the name of my Bank in the Name field instead of my own name. Coinbase told me this in 6.5 hours, I told them I fixed it shortly afterward and within 10-15 minutes they reactivated buying on my account.
Meanwhile on Gemini:
- Did ID Verification for ACH transfers
- Followed up a week later, was told they're busy
- Followed up 2.5 weeks later, was told they're busy
- Followed up 5 weeks later was told my account was already verified a week in (bullshit).
- Called them out on that saying then they shouldn't have told me to keep waiting 2.5 weeks later. Magically in about another hour my account showed up as verified and I got a notification email.
Not only was Gemini slow, but they were either incompetent or lying when they told me my account was already verified.
**Edit:** Clarification.
**Edit 2:** With both accounts now fully able to buy I have no issues with either exchange.

BIP39 in my own terrible words is just basically a set of words (in increments of 3) for the mnemonic seed. Electrum doesnt use BIP39 and uses its own set of words. While that may be better it's not a standard and therefore you're forced to use Electrum.
Wallets that use BIP39  and a BIP32/44 derivation like Mycellium, Copay, Coinomi, etc. basically use a defined standard and are therefore compatible with one another. You can even use an independent [BIP39 Mnemonic system]( to show the derivations of addresses and they will line up with what those wallets give you.
That way if ever those wallets go down, the derivation is still clear and it's a standard allowing you to work out your private keys.
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:16:52

Yes phishing attacks are a real attack and don't really solve 2FA issues. I do agree it would be better if Kraken forced you to go through more to disable the withdrawal 2FA, but my point is you really need login 2FA to keep your account secure.
I didn't mean to be harsh, but I'm not sure why anyone would setup 2FA for withdrawal but not 2FA for login. Do you want someone to log into your account and browse around but not be able to withdraw?

Take Coinomi for instance. You can reveal the seed phrase. So a smart thief like me would play with your phone--hey let me see that new awesome iPhone... wow it's fast. Quickly take a sneak peek at your phrase, take that home and watch the xpub address.... Set alerts for transactions. I might catch you in the middle of a transaction where you have thousands of dollars funneling through, and I jump in and seize it.
Apps like Mycellium, Coinomi, etc should look at Copay's feature to delete the seed phrase.
Now before you tell me you can disable phones remotely, has anyone tried using iCloud on an Android device? So let's say you lose your iPhone--unless your iPhone buddy is next to you right now, good luck trying to remotely lock down an iPhone with an Android phone. How do I know? I have both an iPhone and Android phone and I lost the iPhone for a bit one day at a racetrack. I struggled for at least 10 minutes to lock it down and gave up and went to lost &amp; found instead. Thankfully it was there. In that time funds could've been transferred out long ago already.
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:13:42
Yeah, which is why I don't recommend anyone to use Electrum. It's an incompatible seed standard they use. Stick to BIP39 which works across multiple wallets.

There's a lot more to be said regarding exchanges, but I'll keep it short and only address the insurance piece. The insurance Coinbase talks about is more than likely for a scenario if Coinbase itself gets hacked like an internal admin leaks the password and people empty out Coinbase's cold storage funds.
They most certainly DO NOT cover you if you use a crappy password (e.g. hunter2) and some idiot logs in and steals your funds. So while Coinbase is insured, it's insured in a very specific manner. I advise anyone to look at anything that's insured and confirm the terms to that insurance. Just like health insurance in the US doesn't cover *everything*, insurance that Coinbase has doesn't cover everything either.
**Edit 2:**
I would view Coinbase regular wallet as a typical wallet. Hold as much as you are willing to carry on the street maybe $100 or $200. If you want to store any larger amounts like $1000+, I would recommend at the very minimum to use the Coinbase vault. This isn't 100% safe either, but it's far better than the standard hot wallet. This at least gives you a waiting period during withdraws and you can jump in and intercept if it's not you. Any amounts above $2000 personally I think should be at a minimum held in a wallet you manage yourself, hardware wallet, or the [Coinbase multisig vault]( The Multisig Vault is a step better than the regular Vault as it's not only got a time delay, but Coinbase has no way to steal your funds and you are in 100% control.

Well yeah don't sell the HD, but over decades I have dozens of HDs stacked up. At some point it probably makes sense to dispose of the older ones.
My point is that your ultimate risk is extremely low if your Bitcoins aren't stored in a giant text file called "My Bitcoin Private Keys.txt." Encrypting your drive negates like 99.9% of all threats to begin with, and then wiping it using a multi pass write algorithm probably puts you at a very negligible threat level.
I think it's good to be aware of security risks but at the same time let's not overstate some of the risks.

I know that, but those are historically bugs that have been addressed already. Most of the problems and losses of BTC from Blockchain have come from user error, bad backup management, and bad password management. Ultimately whether a wallet is good or bad should be based on technical evaluation and while reputation matters, reputation also is inaccurate in hivemind/groupthink situations.

Coinbase insurance is very limited. If you have USD stored, it's effectively a bank and is covered by US financial regulations like FDIC, meaning if the bank goes bellyup you will get your funds back. Look at the people who were affected when banks died in 2008. Everyone got their money back through FDIC.
When it comes to Bitcoin, it's very limited in terms of insurance. Read from Coinbase:

Stop the strawman. I never said its generated by human. It can be a 12 **random character** password.
The whole point of a brainwallet is for something that you can recover. It's not going to be the most secure, but at the same time you can't keep assuming that the only way to create it is to use a phrase from the Bible that will get brute forced in 12 seconds. If you combine certain elements of randomness with something relatively complex, you can achieve much higher entropy.
For example the Pledge of Allegiance will get cracked in seconds. But the Pledge of Allegiance + a 12 character random password? It'll be better than the 12 character random password alone, and just the length alone will decrease chances of getting cracked significantly.

Do you have the seed backed up? Try uninstalling and re-installing. That fixed it for me.
I was in a different situation where I backed up the app via Titanium Backup and restored it to a brand new system image (I wiped my phone). All other app restores worked fine, but Copay would just show a white screen. I thought this was maybe a security thing so someone can't just make a copy of your Copay app and restore it to their phone. But perhaps it is a bug if you're experiencing it as well.

GreenAddress, but I think I'm gonna switch away. The 2-of-2 is not suitable for long term storage because of nLockTime or whatever. I may need to look into the 2-of-3 they have.

The thing with hardware wallet is that I feel like it's super secure in the sense that the device that processes payments isn't compromised. However, the issue I have with hardware wallets is it's susceptible to other modes of failure:
1. You write down your seed and misplace it or place it somewhere insecure. This is the same problem with running a wallet like Copay or Mycellium.
2. Hardware failure. Sure you have a backup seed but then why not  any other BIP39 based wallet?
3. Physical coercion--hardware wallets are usually protected by simpler methods like a PIN on the Nano Ledger S. That's a potential weak point.

Maybe you just need to be careful to use your bank's ATMs? Maybe scout out which major bank is in your city and try to stick to their ATMs? Also be smart about when you can use your credit cards? I've only twice in my 12 years since having a checking account have had to incur a fee and that was once at a casino (I didn't understand what having a proper bankroll was), and once internationally when I thought I lost all my foreign currency but buried it in some envelope in the hotel safe, so had to go withdraw more.
Since last year I also carry my Schwab card in my backpack which accompanies all my travel so if I need to hit up any ATM I am not worried about fees.
Honestly Bitcoin isn't that much easier. If I wanted to send money right now I'd probably buy some BTC on Coinbase, incur a 1% fee, and then send to my friend. And then you have to deal with the Bitcoin value fluctuation as most people will convert to fiat ASAP.
@_date: 2015-10-08 22:25:50
Yes, I recognize it is important for everyone to be security conscious and to understand what the government is potentially doing. 
What I'm saying is it's inaccurate to tell everyone to remove email from phones as a general warning. It's a concern and if you have sensitive information, then yes, heed those warnings. However if you're like 99% of other travelers just passing through, maybe it's not that critical.
My point isn't to say threats don't exist--I believe in end to end encryption, encrypting my data in transit and at rest, protecting my private keys, etc, but that doesn't mean everyone else needs to desperately jump on the same boat. I educate my friends about this, but we're not in a world where I need to be chastising those who aren't practicing OP sec the same way as some others are.

I didn't say to use the 12 words from the Bible alone. I said to combine multiple things together (a good password) plus a phrase.
Heck for example if your phone number is 555-1212, you can take 4 words from Page 555 and 3 words from Page 1212 of a book. Combine that with a good 12 character password, and maybe throw in some other crap that only you know, and you're set. Do I agree that a Diceware 12 word phrase is probably better? Yeah, but I'm just trying to say that Brainwallet isn't necessarily completely bad.

It's unfortunate you got downvoted. Most of the losses of funds came from the following:
- Bad password choice
- Backups being emailed to their email address, and email getting hacked.
- Backups being misplaced.
Now you can point to them for being stupid regarding the RNG issue when signing transactions, but honestly how many other companies would reimburse you? Other than the ones that are insured like Circle or Coinbase, if your software had an issue RNG for the seed phrase such as Breadwallet or Mycellium (hypothetically), those devs have zero backing to ever insure your funds if something goes wrong. 
I thought the way that Blockchain handled it--patching their client and then reimbursing people is just fine. The fallout unfortunately was bad, but there are multiple people on who have held large savings of BTC in Blockchain, and if well managed, it has never been an issue.

Honestly if he wanted to be less guilty the way to do it is setup your site for fully encrypted sessions where you yourself don't know what's going on. Kim Dotcom learned his lesson from MegaUpload which was why part of him setting up Mega.co.nz was making it fully end to end encrypted.
Now he can claim he has zero control of what's being hosted as he has no information what's being encrypted. The site will however respond to DMCA takedowns if say someone on Reddit posts a Mega link and says "click here for a 1080p rip of Star Wars Rogue One."
I get that Kim doesn't manage Mega anymore, but that was basically the idea behind it. If Ross wanted to run Silk Road but distance himself, he probably should've probably done less of the illicit stuff and focus on the service itself.

Spending? I'd recommend a deterministic wallet like Copay, Coinomi, Airbitz, Breadwallet, Mycellium. I know Electrum gets a lot of love but I personally prefer a BIP32/BIP39/BIP44 wallet. You don't need to rely on the app to stay alive and can import into different wallet software if you need.

It's unfortunate how you're downvoted, but honestly I have yet to see any confirmed cases of malware or keyloggers actually resulting in compromising of Bitcoin related logins.
Almost all heists so far have resulted from bad password, no 2FA, email compromises, etc. While a mobile device might not be easily hijacked, people forget how often devices are lost. Most wallets are only secured with a PIN, and many aren't even at all. Sure in an ideal world you react fast and wipe your phone, but who knows. Perhaps someone's already gotten ahold of your keys.
I do like how Copay allows you to delete the seed from the app. More BIP39-based walllets should be like that.

You can fight the law in many other ways. If you violate the law, prepare to get punished. I choose not to get involved with marijuana, but I'm not going to call the cops on you if you smoke a joint. However if you get caught and fined, you should also be prepared to face the consequences.
And before we just use a US perspective, countries like South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore also have severe/harsh drug laws and don't have massive drug epidemics like the US. I'd argue part of the drug problem is cultural and not simply the fact that they're outlawed.

Because it's likely US and EU legislation aren't worlds apart. The bank can deny you but there isn't a law saying you WILL be questioned, and that was my point. 
At the end of the day the rules are very similar. Banks are required in the US to report transactions over $10k, so yes if they deem your $10k+ transaction to look fraudulent then can deny you. 1000 EUR isn't all that money and I wouldn't suspect people are going to be questioned over depositing 1000 EUR on a regular basis.

In the US there are laws for gifting, yes, but large transactions happen regularly. Business transactions are easily over $10,000 and happen on a daily basis. It doesn't mean if you transfer $50,000, you are 100% required to explain what happened, but if law enforcement thinks you are doing something suspicious, they might contact you to explain yourself.
You can't simply be arrested for transferring the money unless they really have proof of you money laundering. Simply a dollar amount is insufficient evidence for anything.
Now what's more likely is OP's money was mixed with some illicit business. If they just busted a child porn ring (hypothetically) and they found 12,5000 EUR going to a Bitcoin address which then cashes out to fiat under your name, would you blame law enforcement from being a little suspicious?
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:31:05
I think there's a significant difference between a joint account where you put in what you put in where fiat transactions can be reversed too versus Bitcoin where controlling the private key means the funds could disappear forever.

For a quick online wallet where the rule for ANY hot wallet applies (only put in as much as you're willing to carry in your physical wallet), Blockchain isn't bad.
The ability to import paper wallets, BIP38 support, etc make it reasonable.
Now should anyone use it as long term storage? No. There are better solutions out there.
I also don't agree that avoiding services like Coinbase or Circle entirely is the solution. People should learn their use and understand that putting in $10,000 there is obviously stupid, but if I wanted to get a friend started, Circle or Coinbase would be excellent solutions in getting fiat into Bitcoins.

I agree with you on the benefits but there's lots of ways in modern countries like the US to send money. Many people have said this already, but in general Bitcoin's potential is better with 3rd world countries where micropayments and stuff are in total shit condition. PayPal and Venmo may be evil but millions use it with no fees, instant payments, and no I can PayPal stuff without fear of a seller screwing me over. That simply isn't there with Bitcoin today.
Maybe the best angle for now to get penetration is showing the value and then having people join and and appreciate the features.

It wasn't a strawman attempt. I'm just pointing out that while Vorhees has genuine concerns and he's unfairly treated, this isn't something most of us should be overly concerned about. Also he himself did tell everyone the following:


This is certainly valid for those who are privacy conscious (myself included), but this is NOT a must for the general population. Is it something you should prepare for? Yes, but do you have statistics about how many people's laptops are confiscated at the border?


While I may not be harassed, how many people are? That's my point. I'm not supportive of the surveillance state, but to act like everyone's getting screwed at the border isn't accurate either.

I discovered it around spring of 2011.. maybe a little later like May/June when it was around $5 / BTC or so. Some investor was commenting on these wild swings and saying this is why he sticks to stocks.
I looked into it more and realized that dug around my house and found two DFI Ultra NF4 motherboards with dual PCI-e slots. I thought about it and said nahhh... I did later buy 4 Radeon graphics cards and mined.
I then treated my buddy out for lunch who gave me those 2 motherboards for $30.
I sold my coins at $4 sometime late 2011. I made the hardware costs back and some but it was very sad to see Bitcoin shoot to the moon later.

Encrypt your disk to begin with PLUS when you do your wipes, do a validated 3 pass write. Honestly if you encrypt and wipe afterward it's most likely the data is unrecoverable anyway. They need to get their hands on the encryption key to begin with.
Finally, how would I know how your Bitcoin keys are stored? Is it in a text file? A password protected Zip file? A Keypass container? A LastPass container? And say I got my hands off a 1TB drive. There's so many things of value that could be on there. Not even sure where to start?

Fairly certain both mobile OSes do. They do it in order to learn from your typing mistakes and improve auto-correction and text prediction.
Microsoft wasn't doing it a few years ago because prior to Windows 10, and back in the Windows 7 days and even Vista/XP days, the concept of capturing all user data really wasn't there.
Windows 10 isn't really doing anything more than your mobile OS is in terms of monitoring you, and once again Microsoft like these other big data companies are taking a big risk too. I'm going to suspect that it's most likely these companies are not sending your data in the clear over the internet either. It's likely encrypted and stored in a manner that hackers can't easily get to.
Here's the option from Windows 10:








What I'm trying to get at isn't to defend Windows 10 but rather point out that this is pretty standard practice, and if Windows 10 users are routinely getting passwords and private information compromised because of Cortana then it would be trivial to prove, and almost a guaranteed lawsuit.
It certainly is a privacy concern at the end of the day, and likely you should be worried given the government could potentially access that data, but let's not be overly paranoid assuming it's all leaking into the public.

I know people recommend Copay heavily, but IMO it works well if you have multiple devices or have multiple people.
While it's easy to start a transaction on your phone and then sign the second approver on either your tablet or computer I find that this kind of approval is kinda pointless. If you're just going to hold your two devices and click Approve on both, I don't find that to be a significant improvement in security compared to having only 1 device. I would also recommend not staying logged in on any Bitcoin service (Copay, Coinbase, etc) on your phone and to only log in / enter your seed when you actually need to do something.
I much prefer the 2 of 3 methods that BitGo and Coinbase use where they hold one of the keys which makes transactions on a day to day basis extremely easy. This means you hold one key and they hold the other and you use this for 99% of activities. The 3rd key you store somewhere safe and you should never worry about it unless those services go down. You can set up something similar using Coinkite as well.

Yes BTC-E is accused of money laundering and not complying with KYC and AML. The US banks do that, which is why spends so much time shitting on BoA and Chase. Furthermore in all the articles I've read so far it sounds like Vinnik had ties to the money flowing from Mt Gox. It wasn't that he just operated an exchange with zero ties to the people who were stealing from Mt Gox.
So yeah, I'd argue this is a bit different. If Bank of America was founded for the purpose of money laundering where its board and execs were tied directly to stolen money, then you can bet they'd all get arrested.

Transaction costs are spread amongst all consumers, yes. It's a business cost. Even if you pulled credit cards out, cashing checks is a cost--should business increase costs for those who want to use checks? Or what about Bitcoin? Businesses will cash out on Bitcoin, so do they charge you transaction fees? And what about the fact that Bitcoin has zero protection? So do they charge Bitcoin users more?
You wouldn't want payment method to become a bidding war for goods prices. The reason retailers are required to charge equally regardless of payment method is for consumer protection. What next? You trade blowjobs for goods? 
I do agree the fees from credit cards are worth looking at. Swipe fees are much too high in this day and age. I could understand in the 1990s when internet connections were slow or even earlier in the 80s when you had to pretty much call to process credit card transactions.

Basic digital security isn't the same as Bitcoin security. Most data is stored in the cloud now, so if you want to secure your digital footprint, having a strong Gmail password with 2FA is paramount.

I'm not denying that seizures don't happen--**they do, and our surveillance state is out of control**. However the OPsec that Voorhees is talking about where you NEVER cross a border without removing your email from your phone/tablets and encrypting your hard drives--this doesn't apply to everyone.
Is it good practice? Yeah. Would I do it? The encrypting part absolutely, but to tell everyone to wipe their phones? Not realistic. I'm just pointing that it's not realistic advice that everyone needs to follow similar to buckling up in a car or using protection during sex.
Am I less paranoid than some folks here? Yeah, but I also feel that I practice far better OPSEC than 99.9% of the population. At the same time I feel that I'm at least level headed enough to recognize what is a reasonable expectation for the general population. PGP has been around for years and yet how many people can you count off the street who use it let alone know what PGP is.
To draw a similar parallel--take enhanced interrogation/waterboarding/torture. Should we be concerned it exists and the US government uses it?

A down payment is far different than the value of a building. Yes $200k is easily a down payment in many parts of the Bay Area. My point is $200k isn't a lot in most major metros, and as I showed you, if you want to live in Seattle/Redmond/Bellevue, $200k is not easy at all, and you'd have to move further away.
If anything your comment about $200k shows you're pretty out of touch with most metro areas. The average home price in the US is $189k and that accounts for places where no one wants to live. Most major metro areas are significantly more than that with obvious exceptions like Detroit and Cleveland and other rust belt cities where manufacturing has died off. Moreover, these average figures like the one I showed you account for less than ideal locations too within cities/counties, so even if average home prices in San Francisco are just shy of $1 million, if you want to live anywhere decent, you need to be prepared for $1.3 million+

**Edit:** I get it, people want to downvote. I agree $200k is significantly more than $1k, but at the end of the day it isn't a lot of money. My point is that a "building" (typically not what you call a house), is typically worth far more than $200k if I'm thinking of even a small building like a building in an office complex. Rent @ $1000 is pretty reasonable though.

- Option to delete the recovery phrase from user view for extra security.

I want to use multi sig because I feel somewhat safer if my key is managed by a service. Just like for maximum security, you should probably run your own VPN, your own email server, etc, but does everyone have the technical know how? And what happens when your HD crashes? Did you setup a proper backup service? Offsite backup? These are things that you know Google has thought through and stakes its reputation on when it runs a global email service like Gmail for instance. There are companies that use Google Apps and therefore Google makes every effort to make sure you get great uptime and your data is secure.
So similarly, with Bitcoin, there are many ways to manage keys, but I'm still most comfortable having a service take care of the details of sending and receiving, change addresses and what not. While I could probably use a paper wallet and effectively and securely store funds, i'd probably end up importing it into Blockchain.info when it comes to spending and what not just because there's high risk in messing up change addresses unless you're careful.
Why Multi-Sig? Because there have been so many Bitcoin heists where "wallet services" run off with your funds. That's why people are wary of even companies like Circle and Coinbase. Coinbase's Multisig for instance allows you to trust them with managing the sending/receiving, but ensures that they cannot run off with your money.
As for the different multi sig methods, it's just how Copay works. When you start a multi-sig wallet (take 2 of 3 for example), you need to have 2 other clients including the original one you created join in. For instance you could use your phone, computer, and tablet, but IMO that defeats the purpose of multi-sig if you're just using 3 of your devices. The other way is to give someone you trust with one of the keys, but at the end of the day you're just using 2 of your devices 99% of the time. And how good of a job is your best friend at keeping your 1 key safe? Unless my best friend is someone on or someone who's familiar with PGP encryption, I don't really have many options.
Now if you run a business and your business partner needs to get involved perhaps Copay is a good solution. Also I understand that Copay never holds a key in their multisig use, which is a positive for security but a downside in convenience. If you're flying solo and you just want to hold your funds securely with multisig, I'd recommend Bitgo and Coinbase solutions. You could alternatively use Coinkite and hold all 3 keys on your own and never even trust them with a key.
I'm not saying Copay is bad--I just don't see them as the best multisig solution for me.

Schwab debit card. I land in China with no USD cash on hand and head straight to the ATM and withdraw the $200 equivalent in RMB or whatever I need for the week.
I get the US service isn't perfect, but unless you insist on having a bank account at some small-ass bank, for instance in my most recent trip to NYC, after I ran out of $80 in cash, I walked 2 blocks to the nearest Bank of America and withdrew another $80.
And honestly with how technology is progressing, most of my friends just take turns paying for meals/drinks via credit card and we use Venmo/PayPal to pay each other back. As many have stated before--Bitcoin's advantage isn't for those living in the US who have access to all these money sending apps such as Square Cash, PayPal, Venmo, Chase QuickPay. If anything it's far more cumbersome for me and my friends to exchange money via Bitcoin. There are other demographics though where cash and money transfers are far more difficult that could benefit.

You're moving the goalposts. When we typically talk about housing value, you talk about the total price, not the down payment. So when we talk about a $200k property, it's not about your down payment but how much the property is worth.
Given a down payment can be anywhere from 5% to pretty much 100% of the value, that's quite a sliding scale right?
When I talk about $200k houses being practically non-existent in Seattle I'm referring to the property value not the down payment amount.

Your assumptions are wrong though. You can read about [Bank of America's core checking here]( and the fees are pretty straight forward. You can avoid monthly fees if:




So why would your $200k balance get charged a fee? And mind you that's just core checking which is a basic bare bones account given to your average Joe. If you really have $200k you to sit in a checking account, you might consider their Interest Checking feature where you can avoid a fee by having a combined balance of $10k or more.
So no, my argument isn't that Bank of America is allowed to treat customers like shit--it's more that your story has holes in it if you're saying your dad is getting charged for having $200k in your account. Also keep in mind this fee structure was implemented AFTER the Great Recession, meaning 15 years ago it was likely a lot easier to avoid fees. I remember when I opened my account, simply by auto-transferring $25 to my savings (you can just quickly transfer back manually), you could avoid fees.
My other point was that comparing to First Republic is just stupid. I've been to dozens of Bank of America branches and while I've had to wait sometimes, it's never more than 5 minutes. The last time I saw 5 people in line before the holidays, they were having their account services team come over and walk by to see if they could help people out quickly. I just needed to get $100 bills for a Vegas trip and was helped immediately. First Republic targets higher end customers with much higher minimum balances and higher monthly service fees. You'd think that paying more to a bank makes sense that you get faster service right?
**So you basically complained about fees and then lines, and then pointed to a bank that charges higher fees and minimums as being better?** Great. I mean gee, I'd love to have my own private banker too. Those services definitely aren't free.

I agree completely with Coinbase multisig. A lot of haters will tell you Copay is the way to do it, but what do they end up doing? Setting up their PC and their tablet as 2 additional signers for 2-of-3, which I find inconvenient. If you're out of your house and need to spend quick what do you do? Whoops.
2-of-3 with Coinbase is similar to what you can set up at Coinkite or BitGo. Essentially having Coinbase hold one of the keys ensures convenience yet prevents them from running away with your funds. Your third key should almost never be used and only really be needed if you Coinbase went down the drain.

Back up both. Also BIP39 words are chosen so you don't have easy mixups. There isn't "fall" and "fell" or "built" and "build." Basically you can type the first 4 letters and you already know which word it is.
So while you are right it's easy to mess up writing/backup of words, BIP39 has basic pokeayoke features to make it reasonably easy to do so and relatively error-prone.
I think the biggest error source is probably mixup of order. When you have 24 words, it's very easy to write them down in the wrong order. Anyhow, do both and test the backup first.

Structuring is illegal too. Don't do it. If you need to send $20,000, just do it. Plenty of transactions happen. As long as you pay your taxes, you are fine. The government has no problem with that. What they do have a problem is if you try to dodge taxes.
It's a similar thing when we talk about customs. The US has a 1L duty-free limit for liquor that you can bring in. Most customs agents don't care if you bring 2 bottles of  Whisk(e)y, or even 6 bottles. But if you try to hide it, that will get you in far more trouble.

All the GPUs survived mining. If noise and power are not a concern, then it would make sense to bump everything to max. You probably have a good point if I was running a serious mining operation looking at multiple clusters and routinely changing GPUs out almost like a mining farm/datacenter would do (but with HDDs). But back in the day it was clearly about maxing hashrate, and you did everything possible to get there. Even if bumping fan speeds to 100% only give you an extra 5% hashrate, all that was justified IMO.

I think this is where Coinbase has been analyzing their data. Do they accept users who transmit directly with illicit activities? Or is 1 hop OK? Because at a certain point you're right coins are going to be tained, so you can't ask for 0 link to any illicit activity, but at the same time you can't be a conduit for clearly illegal activity and not get prosecuted.
It's a careful balance I'm sure Coinbase's own people are looking at. They don't want to get in trouble but they don't want to alienate the entire user base.

I wouldn't say it's entirely wrong, but I think some people put too much faith in their phones. How many people properly lock their phones? Given that Android encryption hasn't been standard for some time (whereas encryption has been made standard on iOS devices since the 3GS and has had full device encryption since iOS8). Furthermore Android fingerprint readers have only been coming in slowly, and as a result many studies have shown a large majority doesn't even bother using a PIN lock on their Android phones.
How many phones are lost daily? That should make it worrisome. How many of you secure your phones the minute you lost it? Do you lock down your phone the minute you know its missing? Is that already too late?
And then let's look at our favorite apps--Copay for instance doesn't even have a PIN lock, so if you are an average Joe that doesn't lock their phone to begin with or even encrypt it, someone can access your Copay wallet and steal your recovery phrase. The same with Coinomi. I personally highly discourage spending and stuff on your wallet unless your phone is rock solid secure and you take a lot of good precautions.
I'd argue a paper wallet with BIP38 is probably more secure although more prone to being lost (who hasn't lost papers before?)

That and you can search for quite a few things and not have the FBI/NSA/CIA come knocking on your door.

It was a mistake on Alamo's part for a double charge, but before you blame the whole payment system, maybe you should understand how it works.
3. Go read Debit cards aren't recommended.

Not everyone backs those up. I personally do, but out of all the people who use 2FA, how many do? This is interesting because the whole world of 2FA is fragmented.
With services like Google, you're trained to have SMS backup and at worst case you have one time use codes to print out. The reality is that there's so many services out there that don't have those features, and every service has different 2FA backup mechanisms. What does Blockchain.info do if you lose your 2FA? Do you just email them and beg them to turn it off?
I've personally pushed people to use Authy to take that whole lost token problem out of the picture, but I can't imagine everyone's as well prepared as I am.

That's not how hardware encryption works. Hardware encryption means that there's a key embedded in the harware that when combined with your user entered password becomes the encryption key.
It forces for the encryption and decryption to be done on the device. Part of the FBI's request to Apple was to help them so the brute forcing of the iPhone data can be done on a separate device--imagine if you could brute force on a GPU cluster instead of having an intern sit there and punch in passcodes.

I completely agree with you, but at the same time their practices hurt the bitcoin community too. If we all have to learn to transfer money to a secondary address before doing anything, that could hurt adoption.
I'm not one to whine about Coinbase and I'm sick and tired of all the complaining here, but at the same time I'm torn about how to proceed. I take the necessary precautions so Coinbase doesn't ban me, but that doesn't mean that should be the solution for mass adoption.

It's a strange and different setup, but it took 5 seconds to figure out after I enabled 2FA on my account. It's funny because you can essentially set 3 different 2FA tokens, and it's VERY clearly listed. The first is Account login, the second is Trading, and the third is Funding.

If you forsee doing transactions (small or large) on a exchange, I think it's better off to do the whole identity verification. Don't wait for them to ask you. Large companies like Gemini, Coinbase, etc know how to handle this, so if you are OK with it, submit those documents. I've never had problems moving money through these institutions. When you start doing stuff that gets questionable like dark markets, gambling, that's when your money gets scrutinized. If you don't want questions to be raised, then don't use these exchanges for those gray area activities.

Interesting. Never knew that. I looked into it for AT&amp;T and it seems like something you need to opt in for. While I'm no fan of SMS 2FA, this is another reason to secure your wireless account passwords too.
I still think its a stretch to say that having 2FA via SMS = your account is definitely vulnerable. Most people are vulnerable to some degree, and the idea for most internet security is making yourself a much more difficult target to hack than your average Joe.
Also regarding signing up for online access to SMS, when I tried just signing up now on AT&amp;T, it required me to confirm via text... so I'm still not seeing this attack vector into Coinbase. I'd have to confirm it and then get my AT&amp;T and Coinbase accounts hacked together.

That's a separate issue. I don't think anyone in her campaign wants her to go through any more trouble. Her numbers tanked significantly these past 2 weeks as a result of the email thing. Even though she got off free, it's not something you want in a campaign that could potentially be close.
Anyhow, my point wasn't to make it political, but to illustrate that if you are a public figure, and someone finds out your wallet addresses, then all those transactions are up there for scrutiny. Sure candidates post tax returns, but I doubt any one of them wants to show you every single credit card transaction for the public to scrutinize over.

Copay's multi sig requires you to have multiple devices. Or people. I agree that as a model that's good if you want your payment approved by your spouse or business partner, but in the traditional sense I still think a multi sig (2-of-3 for instance) implementation that BitGo or Coinbase has works far better in that they hold one of the keys.
Now that might be a step down in security, but for 99% of the time, the point is that you want to be able to sign in and send something but you also want to make sure that whatever Wallet you use can't run off with your money--which is why those companies went that route with 2-of-3.
In the case of Copay, you need to make sure your multiple devices are in working order and you can secure them all. Are all your desktops/laptops properly encrypted? Is your phone and tablet secure? Your phone might be on you, but is your tablet just lying around the house?
Moving back to the 2-of-3 that Coinbase uses, you would store that backup 3rd key in a very secure place. Are you going to do that with one of your devices? I just feel that its more difficult to manage the keys when you're trying to secure your funds in the Copay implementation.
@_date: 2015-10-30 21:58:12
Thanks. So I think Coinomi, Multibit, Mycellium should be able to be used interchangeably.

Those are the backup codes that are specific to Google logins. What I mean is that since people use the Google Authenticator app to add tokens for other sites, they should back up those token seeds for you into a Google account of your choosing. Because while some sites like Discord and Evernote also offer backup codes and Facebook and Amazon offer SMS fallback, there really isn't a good way to back up your 2FA tokens unless you're smart and you backed up the 2FA seed or QR code in the beginning. I can assure you I don't know of a single person who has aside from enthusiasts here or myself.
For those very paranoid, Google could offer zero knowledge encryption backed with a password of your choosing similar to Authy, but IMO that's not necessary. Google Chrome itself already acts as a password manager tied to your account, so personally I think that they should tie 2FA tokens to your Google account so you can add a whole bunch of them and not worry about what happens after you lose your phone.
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:01:48
Yeah but opting out of fiat isn't portfolio diversification either.
@_date: 2016-07-25 18:09:03
What if you lost your 2FA tokens? In general you're right that would be the ideal approach, but most 2FA removals are because of a lost device.
I hate to criticize the whole system but I think the weakest link in all of security of 2FA is the ability to disable 2FA due to lost phones.
With that said I feel that this is a special case because the Withdrawal 2FA is not tied to login 2FA, so it seems too easy to disable. Perhaps all 2FA disabling should force a 48 hr delay where the account email is notified immediately, followed by 12 hour notifications including a final notification 2 hours before disabling.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:57:40
I'm not saying your situation is wrong, but could your situation also be a YMMV?
Because here I can offer a very positive experience with credit cards. I'm relatively young but have established credit for over 10 years now. I'm fairly aware of tricks and benefits via and while I'm not one to go open and cancel cards, I do a fairly good job building up rewards points.
With that said I travel a lot for work--be it Europe or Asia, Canada and Mexico. I personally use a Chase Sapphire Preferred card and my company gives me a corporate card too. As late as 2015, I was e-mailing Chase each time I go out of the country to let them know of international travel and I've NEVER had any issue with my cards getting declined or blocked. The only time I ever had an issue was back in 2014 when I bought a drink at a Starbucks with my corporate card and they somehow blocked my card because they identified it as fraud. As a result my next hotel cancelled my reservation (they couldn't charge the card apparently) and I had to re-book it at a full price. Yes it caused a little hassle in that I was panicking, but I sat down and thought it through. It's a company card. It's a business trip. Who cares if my hotel is now $180 instead of $150/night. I called Citi, resolved the issue, brought my card back to the counter and they rebooked me. After realizing they can't give me a great rate, they gave me a bunch of coupons for food at their nice restaurant.
While Bitcoin is certainly nice, I also don't think I can survive very easily in most countries without my credit cards. If every swipe of a Credit Card was met with nightmare-ish questions, you'd bet the Visa network wouldn't be serving thousands of transactions per second.
Also regarding your note about conversion fees:


If you convert currency at a reputable bank, the exchange rates are very reasonable. I used to convert money at the airport for China or Japan, and honestly the fees were something like less than 1%. The exchange rates were pretty good too. Yeah, Travelex is a total ripoff, but Travelex isn't 100% representative of how it is to convert currency either.
I'd also add there are cards you can use internationally with no foreign transaction fees and no ATM fees (ahem Charles Schwab) that gives you Visa Forex conversion rates, which is as good as it gets. Even Bitcoin can't match that.

What happens if you lose your phone? This is in general a weakness of 2FA security--especially with a shitty app like Google Authenticator where if you lose your phone or wipe your phone you're SOL.
So yeah, services have inherent weaknesses to help with that, and knowing that Bitcoin is global, you can't expect them to have 2FA backup via SMS which many other services (Facebook, Amazon, etc.) will offer.
@_date: 2016-07-26 06:40:12
Yeah and that's cool, but it's not a standard 2FA solution. Google, Evernote, Discord do it some others rely on SMS, and some other smaller services don't even offer backup, especially Bitcoin solutions that are international.
This is why I've been calling on Google for a long time to offer 2FA token backups in their app. Considering most people using 2FA right now are enthusiasts, can you imagine if we actually get the mainstream public on to 2FA tokens? Your average Joe who goes out and gets trashed and loses his phone at the bar is gonna be pretty pissed when he doesn't have a way into his account.
@_date: 2016-07-01 05:28:10

I'm not shilling for them. Resorting to namecalling because my choices in banking don't agree with yours is pretty sad.


That's great. Many other banks do that too. Having physical branches within minutes of my office, home, parents' home, and practically anywhere I in the US is still nice to have. I have a Schwab and Ally account too, so I'm not worried about ATM fees. And no, I don't just have BofA. I use Chase as well, and both big banks have worked well.


Well La Taqueria is out there so I might try.


Okay, well I'm not a high net worth client. I'm a lowly tech bro, but I do manage my finances well, so I'd think that putting my money into investment accounts makes most sense. I never really understood people who keep $200k around in a checking account anyway. There's places you can put that money with better returns and have it easily accessible. First Republic might be a good choice but honestly paying for wealth management is a bit stupid too. Unless you're trying to operate trusts to pass down wealth and have extremely complex finances, you don't need a bank to sell those services. Also big banks have products for wealthier customers too like Chase's Private Client. Wealth Management services for BoA are available too.


You're better off keeping the card open and letting it age unless you have an annual fee. I don't have any Bank of America credit cards because they mostly suck.

How'd it get hacked? Bad password? Poor security? Reuse of addresses? Because honestly Blockchain.info, if you understand how it works, isn't bad at all. It's not too hard to properly secure your funds on there, but it's also not hard to misplace your funds and get them stolen.
I'm going to say this again and again but every single case of lost coins I've seen here has been a result of:
- Bad password
- Misplacement of wallet files (in email, Dropbox, etc. and those accounts get hacked)
- No 2FA--although having your password hacked is still a bad thing, 2FA can make things slightly better.
Now before someone brings up the money that Blockchain lost through RNG issues, all that money was refunded anyway. The rest of the thefts are really user error. That's why I say it's not a good wallet for beginners, but if you know what you're doing it's relatively safe--it's really as safe as you can make it.

2. Carry an ATM card/debit card. You should use this sparingly. I carry the Charles Schwab Debit card (zero foreign transaction fees + zero ATM fee) which I essentially use to pull all my cash out internationally. My backup is my standard Bank of America card. Notify these banks as well regarding international travel.
3. Carry some cash. I skip this as I've become too reliant on my Charles Schwab account, so I don't bring any foreign cash anymore, but once again I'm not gonna whine like the OP on this forum complaining if things go south as I know what I'm getting myself into. For countries I visit regularly (Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong), my system works pretty well and I know which banks/ATMs to trust.
4. Be prepared to call your bank when things go south! I've had to call Bank of America when I flew across the country for vacation once just because they froze my account when I tried to get cash. A quick 5 minute phone call resolved it all.

Dude your own misunderstanding of personal finance is misrepresenting credit cards. It sounds like you used a **debit card** which in general isn't the best tool to use unless you don't know how to manage credit. Maybe you should do your due diligence regarding the problems with debit cards. Your problem could've hit if someone skimmed your card and stole money. Sure you might not be liable at the end of the day, but when your account is drained and it takes a hypothetical 3 days for your bank to put funds back, and that's all you have what do you do?
This is why it's recommended you carry multiple cards when you travel. One gets compromised? Switch to another. Plus, most cards will try to help you out on vacation by next-day shipping cards even internationally if needed.
Do you know what % of transactions are double charges on credit/debit cards? Because honestly if this was occurring to even something like 1% of users, no one would be using plastic. You planned poorly for a trip hoping that $800 on a debit card would get you by. If a double charge brought you to a negative balance, it essentially suggests that you spent 50% of your bank account on a rental car. Brilliant financial planning.

I think it's still different. In the traditional sense you might have shared bank accounts, but for a lot of things like closing the account, you still need both parties present. And keep in mind fiat is reversible. There's probably some legal recourse if someone tries to run off with money. That's why there are civil suits.
You run off with someone's Bitcoin and it's pretty much irreversible. The risks are greater with Bitcoin, and no marriage is perfect.

Sent BTC to Bodog from Mycelium or Circle? If from Mycelium, that's still strange, because assuming when you sent the 1 BTC from Mycelium to Circle, it should've pushed your funds into a new change address. Sounds like Circle is looking at transactions more seriously than I thought.
@_date: 2016-07-01 05:48:46
Well maybe the OP should understand the risks of using a debit card? If a double spend took his balance from $800 to negative, that suggests he put half of his original balance on a rental car. Would you really go on vacation spending 50% of your bank account?
Not having a credit card is one thing, but his whole post is complaining about credit cards when he's most likely using a debit card based on his description. 
Not sure how Bitcoin would solve his problem here as a un-reversible transaction would likely get his poor financial planning into more trouble.

Absolutely. But one can also just monitor the addresses using another tool right? This danger could occur with any Blockchain monitor essentially.


Well so does any tool that you use to monitor addresses. I mean isn't this why we call Bitcoin pseudoanonymous?


I agree this has been a problem, but haven't they refunded people in the past? I agree that if you need to do a lot of transactions Blockchain.info is probably not a good place to put your funds. It should only be used as a hot wallet, and even then there are better solutions.

I have an account and I'm verified to do buys and sells, but I just haven't bought or sold anything, because why would I need to when I can do it through Coinbase/Gdax/Gemini for which I'm all verified to buy/sell on?


I'm speaking about fees in the broad sense. If I'm paying for a shitty price to buy Bitcoins (e.g. Coinbase is ~$2790 right now, but LBC is $2860+), that in a sense is a fee. The exchange rate is just flat out bad.


Yes it's possible to, but I used the cash example as an illustration. If you do other online payment methods like Chase Quickpay or BoA transfers, you still go through your bank--which begs the question is it better to let my bank know I'm cashing out $100,000 through Coinbase, or is it better to let them know Joe Smith who may be a convicted drug dealer 2 years down the road is sending me a direct transfer of $100,000?
I tend to think that rather than tying myself to random folks on LocalBitcoins would be worse.


I'm not pretending I used it. But I'm pointing out some disadvantages to Local Bitcoins. For people who always claim that LBC is the solution--it's not. It fulfills the needs for some, but just because I can buy all my groceries through a barter system in an alleyway, why would I do that when I can enjoy 5% cashback on my credit card at a reputable grocery store?


And that's my point. It has limited use, and in terms of having funds/assets seized or getting flagged by your bank, there's certainly high risk. If you're doing fully legal trading on Coinbase and are an investor who's sunk $100,000 into investments and made a 200% gain, cashing out through GDAX and paying your taxes is the safest way NOT to have the IRS, cops, or feds on your ass. There's many users here on who trade large amounts and have done 5-6 digit sales and transfers with no issues.

@_date: 2017-06-11 21:02:41
The issue is ACH transfers. ACH transfers take usually 3-5 business days. I've seen some companies do it faster, but with Bitcoin I can see why it's an issue.
For instance with Paypal or Venmo, you can instantly transfer to your friends. Those companies are willing to float the money while an ACH transfer completes. However they will not let you cash out that quickly.
Bitcoin is a bit more risky because once it's gone it's gone. There's no one to ensure you pay up so I can see why Coinbase takes their time.
The usual one week delay is because that's ~5 business days.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:32:46

Doesn't Authy also require e-mail confirmation in addition to phone login?
**Edit:** Confirmed that adding devices to a multi-device list does not need anything beyond either:
1. Confirming via a second device
2. Entering the 6 digit SMS code they text you.
My suggestion is if you want to use multi-device, turn on multi-device first, add all your devices, then turn it off. Authy says that once you turn off Multi-Device your existing devices are active but you cannot add any more new ones.
I also think that Authy does a better job at protecting Google Authenticator accounts than its own keys. You are required to decrypt Authenticator tokens upon initially setting up Authy. Those backed up Google Authenticator tokens are encrypted with a password that only you know.
@_date: 2016-07-01 00:31:48
Yeah, but IMO Copay makes more sense if you are using it with multiple people (like shared business expenses). If you need to use money on the go, you're not going to carry two phones or a phone and a tablet and expect to authorize both.

[I don't think that's entirely true]( It's up to the states really and all those federal laws are specifically vague. If it was clearly a felony, you would be reported to the feds already for each gambling transaction.
It's more that Coinbase doesn't want to associate itself with potentially questionable activities. So let's say you do make money off of online gambling. You're supposed to report it for tax purposes. But can Coinbase provide a full traceability for your profits? What if you get in trouble for tax fraud. Is Coinbase responsible for being that vehicle? From a cover-my-ass standpoint, of course they don't want to get involved. So they do their best to cut you off.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:19:17
Sorry I meant to write there is no backup option. That's why my next sentence says nothing is saved in the cloud. Sorry. Brain fart.
With regards to SMS, I never said Google Authenticator has anything to do with SMS. I said some sites use SMS as a backup for 2FA if you lose your token because its for average users. Facebook and Gmail ask for your phone # to setup 2FA. So when you say you lost your token they can SMS you as a backup. My point is that even if you are using Google Authenticator, if your site uses SMS as a backup 2FA or even password resets, that's still an attack vector.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:35:39
True but if it's that big of an issue, then people left and right would be getting screwed. Yes, people get hit with civil asset forfeiture but it's not as common as you may think. Cops don't pull you over and check your wallet and pull cash out. Most of the time it's more like they pull you over, you have expired plates, they smell weed on you, pop your trunk, find a duffel bag of 10,000 cash and then seize it. Does it suck? Yeah, but at the same time that's not the same as walking down the street blending in in NYC and then getting randomly stopped and money stolen out of your wallet by the cops.
I think part of this is depending on how big of a sum you're cashing out. If you're cashing out several hundred of the total several hundred (let's say 250 out of 500 BTC), then yeah you might want to get serious financial advice. Either way, I think it would be worth keeping this sub updated as it seems this topic gets debated from time to time with no real resolution.
**Edit:** I have an inkling you might be overthinking these large transactions. Regular transactions between brokerage accounts and bank accounts of 6 digits happen on a daily basis. People cash out their portfolios for large purchases (homes, cars, etc.)
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:15:51
Google Authenticator has (edit: no) backup option by default. Nothing is saved to the cloud. You need to be careful though if your site's 2FA has an SMS backup feature as anyone hijacking your phone # or SMS can still get in. That's less Google Authenticator and more how your site uses 2FA.
**Edit:** What I meant about SMS was that some sites fall back to SMS if you say you lost your Google Authenticator tokens. If SMS is ever used as a backup 2FA method or even password resets, that's still an attack vector.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:53:17
I agree the guy could've had a better setup. However in my investigation, I believe setting up a brand new Authy account I believe requires SMS + email verification, whereas adding a multi-device just needs the SMS verification or another old device confirming the new device. I can see some problems with this already.
Also, even with email verification, if your GMail has 2FA, the backup is usually SMS meaning if they hack your SMS, they can likely get into your Gmail too (assuming your password is hacked). 
So I do find that Authy is a bit insecure in this aspect. What I do find ironic is that they encrypt your Google Authenticator tokens with a zero knowledge password that only you know--why don't they do it for Authy tokens also? The idea of 2FA is something you know+something you have, so the way they secure Authenticator tokens (SMS + password you know) is a great setup.

Well considering most people are getting into Bitcoin through exchanges like Coinbase, Circle, Bitstamp, etc. I imagine many of us here have bought Bitcoin through one of those exchanges.
If those transaction records were ever released to the public, or it was revealed who sent what transactions, it'd be pretty quick to figure out what kind of stuff you've done unless you've made sure to tumble every transaction. Even then its not like you're 100% safe.
My concern also applies to those gamblers out there. [This thread]( makes it sound like you can quickly avoid Coinbase detection. Sure. But, but what if today you do daily betting transactions using 1 hop, and they don't care, but next month they decide to look into the next step of transactions? It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out you're gambling if ALL your transactions go to another address first before hitting a gambling site.
Yes it does take some work to figure out who's doing what, but if financial institutions are already looking into this, with a public record, it doesn't take too long to figure out which addresses are doing gambling, which ones are paying for illicit activites, etc.
@_date: 2016-07-01 05:32:50
I know there are plenty of solutions out there. I have used Electrum before and currently use Copay and Coinomi. I'm not trying to say Blockchain.info is better or anything. It certainly has its uses as in you can access your funds via the web anywhere you go which is pretty cool.
IMO a standard login process is very versatile in that it allows for easy access on the go. Certainly another option is to memorize a 12-24 word seed phrase.

Do you know how many people enter the country each year? Even if America didn't have these issues, a country of 300,000,000+ people easily can have a bunch of people leaving or not being happy.
With that said I'm American and I trade crypto with no issues. Obviously you can hate the government all you want if you get in trouble gambling, but if you're going to gamble with Bitcoin and expect to cash out on Coinbase like nothing happened, that's the same as if you played online poker today and tried to evade taxes. It's money laundering.

I'm curious--what's with all this lawyer advice? Is paying taxes on this not sufficient or do you think OP is going to be seriously scrutinized over these assets? Like if he has 100 BTC and he sells 50 BTC right now do you really think feds are going to seize the $150k when it hits his bank account?
I'm pretty sure if he can get a sale through Coinbase/GDAX and they don't see this as gambling money, they'll let it go through and go to his bank account. As long as he pays taxes on it he's probably fine.
Yeah I mean a lawyer would be nice, but a lawyer would be nice for everything we do in the US--is it practical to have a lawyer hand hold you as you get in your car today because most likely you aren't going to stop for a full 3 seconds before making a right turn at a red? Probably not.
@_date: 2016-07-17 08:39:22
I agree there isn't 100% proof that you control the next step, but there's something suspicious if that happens every time... which almost makes it necessary to randomnize your activities.. I also understand that I'm being a bit paranoid, but let's just take a hypothetical real world scenario today--let's say in review of Hillary Clinton's emails, she has receipts for sending bitcoins every few weeks to another address. Now, consistently her bitcoins go 1 hop from Coinbase to a set of addresses (assume unique addresses each transaction) and then to a known illicit activity site. You're absolutely right we have zero proof she's doing the 1 hop, but do you think the public cares about that? would be in flames, and CNN would be speculating. You think her campaign would want this kind of scrutiny? She could claim that she pays for eBay auctions for antiques, but you don't think it's one bit suspicious if every one of those direct transactions can be traced to illicit activity?
Most of this isn't a problem today because Bitcoin is FAR from mainstream. But if it becomes the tool that we want it to be in replacing the dollar, you can bet the blockchain will be analyzed furiously. Can you imagine how much information we could possibly piece together if every credit card transaction were in the public? Even if you anonymized each transaction, you can spot patterns pretty easily.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:37:36
Then how do you expect someone to cash out? If you want to cash out legally and  pay your taxes, Coinbase is your best bet.
If you're suggesting OP cashes out 100 BTC through LocalBitcoins and then slowly deposits that cash in to his bank account that's going to be FAR more suspicious and far more liable for civil asset forfeiture.

You can't really bring an unlocked phone to Verizon in the sense that you can slap a SIM card in. You can probably buy a used Verizon phone and try to activate it, but that's it.
The solution to this is if you're going to BYOD on any major carrier, is that you take advantage of the contract pricing and buy a new phone and sell it.
So if you want a Nexus 5 on AT&amp;T? Get an iPhone 5S, sell it, then slap the SIM card into your Nexus 5.
But BYOD isn't just about saving money, it's about bringing your own device that's outside of the controls of your stupid carrier. No software updates need to go through your carrier. You don't get an AT&amp;T logo slapped on your device. You also don't get an ugly 4G logo on your Android status bar. 
Plus if you're a new user going to AT&amp;T, their new Next plans do account for BYOD where you save $15 compared to someone who has to use mobile share with a subsidized phone.

This is why I've advocated big time for 2-of-3 wallets like Coinbase Multi Sig and Bitgo. It's sad Coinkite had to go, but this is really the kind of multisig the masses need.
You want easy access where you login and you can spend, but you don't want the online wallet service to steal your funds. That way you trust them with one key, use a password for the second key, and hold a 3rd key in reserve in case the service goes away.
I understand this is not the most secure system, but it's the one where I can see users get behind because it makes most sense for the masses where they can still control their keys.
Copay addresses this differently, but you're not going to carry 2 devices at once, so their service IMO is better where you have a business partner and want to approve transactions together.

Why doesn't Authy require a password to decrypt Authy tokens upon adding a new device?
It seems like you only need SMS confirmation or a second device to authorize you before you can add a new device. The Google authenticator tokens are then locked by a password that requires you to decrypt them, but the Authy tokens are good to go immediately.
To me that just sounds like a flaw. Rather than disabling multi-device feature, why not just lock Authy accounts with a password to begin with?

Ok, so other than meeting up with people there aren't really many good ways if you need to cash out. ACH may suck but you want pick an exchange like CEX.IO that charges you $50 commission for wire transfers?
People don't understand that for mass adoption you need to make it easy. People use Venmo because there aren't a bunch of fees left and right and hoops you need to jump through. It may be the worst privacy ever, but it's usable.

Lavabit shut down on their own will. But keep in mind the request was pretty severe--they wanted to get the SSL keys so they could intercept anything. That's essentially asking for a backdoor to snoop on data, which is far worse than handing over data that Lavabit can already read.
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:51:58
Wow, so this means I can't cash out of some Bitcoins right now? BoA will stop my withdraw? Should I look at another bank? Would I have more luck with Chase? Ally?
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:29:03
While you do bring up good points, this kind of attitude to beginners is not what's good.
Let's draw a parallel--is using Gmail good for a beginner? "NO FVCKYOU, USE TUTANOTA OR PROTONMAIL AND ADD PGP SECURITY. YOU'RE FEEDING DATA TO THE NSA BY USING GMAIL."
Ok thanks dude. I'm sure email would be very prevalent if it weren't for providers like Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo making it easy for the average user.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:57:52
Never mind. I probably looked at the data sorted incorrectly by date.
I'm just trying to track my hacker, and I don't see how my funds got dispersed... Shrug.

Misinformation here. Sites that operate in the US have to comply with US law. If you read the article, Facebook and Apple complied too. When there's a subpoena served, they have to comply. Which one of these companies is going to go out of business for you? I doubt many will.
The solution isn't to flock to another site. Sure sites in other countries might be subject to more lax regulations, but that doesn't change the fact that your information is still accessible--when their host country wants something they have to comply. The solution is something decentralized (ahem that's the purpose of Bitcoin right?). Considering you can control your own keys, that should be the primary way you control funds. With that said if you want to exchange fiat with Bitcoins, you probably will have to deal with law abiding exchanges unless you are OK with meeting up in person to do cash transactions.

I agree about the first. I'm not talking about how to generate correct phrases. I'm saying why even bother with phrases if bots are targeting phrases. Even if you offer great entropy with pass**phrases**, isn't that still being predictable? Aren't you better off with a truly random password with random characters?
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:51:03
See you in court! Oh oops, this isn't Twitter.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:51:23
that is pretty cool!
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:19:45
What is going on there? I'm not really sure what's going on since I haven't cashed out of MtGox since 2011.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:52:38
Yeah. Eclipse showed me 3 IPs, 2 of which belong to me (1 mobile, 1 home IP). 
The reason why I posted that address was that's what was left in my EclipseMC payout address. I know I had it as my Blockchain address and I've only cashed out only a few times before. Unless the guy updated it multiple times (trying to confirm with Eclipse right now), this is likely the cash out address. I just don't see the funds, you're right. Could there be some anonymizing service that spreads funds out?
I then googled 1N3FKzwoT5nZmZrotrnTQkEyBJczyiLiEF and a Facebook post came up with someone saying their Deepbit got hacked and funds got transferred to that address.
Sorry for being so newb, but when I google that address I get this result: 
I see "67919aeece5c20d51c40f88fced... 	0.19308104 	true" and I'm wondering if that's it.... Don't know why I don't see it on blockchain though!
I run MS Essentials on my main computer. It's probably not the best AV program, but I'm pretty careful with trojans and malware and stuff, and have had a pretty good rate in not getting in trouble. I scanned last night and there was no issue. However my mining rig is a POS Windows XP Laptop freshly formatted 2 years ago. I barely touch it and I highly doubt it's an issue, but I'll run a Hitman Pro scan on it right now just to be sure. I never installed MS Security Essentials on it because this laptop is slow to begin with (from 2003).
**Edit 2:** Scanning right now with Hitman and it shows CGWatcher as a trojan? Must be a false positive I hope. I use bfgminer + CGWatcher which is highly reputable on Bitcointalk.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:09:28
But with paper wallets I feel like the chance of losing the paper is FAR greater than having strong password + 2FA broken. And with Blockchain.info, can't you download your wallet to backup locally? Or even do a paper backup?
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:28:46
Regarding your fear of Google Authenticator, I believe there's a "Move to a different phone" option on Google, meaning your data is backed up in the cloud.
But a better solution than Google Authenticator is to use Authy. They store a cloud backup that needs to be decrypted. You also have to verify via phone AND text when you reinstall on a new phone, and then you can add a pin lock too. To me that's mighty secure.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:42:37
Maybe but it's not really a big deal. 30 years old means 8 years of working and if you're saving 16k a year that's 128k on top of market gains. If we're using the last 8 years for instance, that puts us just outside of the recession window meaning massive growth in the past few years. Even someone who invested in 2008 would've seen a lot of gains by now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:20:12
So I guess I need to stop acting as if the Mt. Gox price is the real price, and bear in mind the lower Coinbase price...
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:11:27
So the thing I discovered regarding Blockchain is that if your money has been sitting in the same address, even if you upgrade your password and add other fancy password tricks, the old backups are still encrypted with the crappy password.
Therefore, you need to be careful if you sprinkled those old wallets around. Someone can import it easily. Perhaps someone got ahold of your old wallet backups.

@_date: 2013-12-09 02:14:57
how do you calculate entropy of a 24 character password?
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:36:48
I thought has been in love with so many wallets in the past (e.g. Electrum, Mycellium which looks like total ass, Copay, GreenAddress)
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:28:51
Well yeah, so a 24 random ASCII password w/ symbols should be 24 * 6.570 = 157.68 bits of entropy. Even if we make it ~ 128 bits, aren't most brainwallets phrase based anyway? My point was you should be unpredictable. If dictionary bots are going through and checking phrases, wouldn't you be better off using random characters?
Once again I'm keeping "remembering your brainwallet" as a separate discussion.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:18:51
Absolutely. Basically your weakest link might not be your Blockchain password, but if it's something else, then you need to secure that something else too!
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:35:28
Don't mean to threadjack, but if someone were to get into your Coinbase account, and someone purchased Bitcoins on your behalf, they could cash that out practically instantly, and you'd be out a lot of $$$. It would be pretty difficult to dispute this right?
This was the main point of friction with my parents when I tried to get them on Bitcoin. I realize that consumer protection laws allow you to dispute fraudulent transfers, but you are certainly hoping that Coinbase will provide you with IP addresses or vouch that it wasn't you who logged in, etc. so that your bank doesn't screw you over right?
I guess my point is that while I'm fairly confident in Coinbase being reputable, I wouldn't be surprised if there were nightmare cases.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:41:48
Can you explain this a bit more? So if I have a bitaddress and I follow this tutorial from Blockchain (
and say I have 20 BTC in my new paper wallet. If I send 15 BTC out to say my Coinbase account to cash out, the 5 BTC goes into a change wallet. How would I get to that 5 BTC? Is it impossible?
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:18:26
I didn't mean to hijack, but if he were to cash out now, should he use Mt. Gox or Coinbase? THe price seems much better on Gox.
This is assuming Gox and Coinbase are both verified for trasnfers at this point.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:38:58
Doesn't Gox allow you to? My trades have been instant. Or does it fail in panic/mass rally situations? I caught some today on the rumor, and it was rising fast, but I still got in instantly on Gox.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:26:17
how is your wallet stored?
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:31:57
I logged in today to find 17 BTC! WOW. HOLY FVCK. I forgot about my Mt. Red account.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:44:38
Yeah. With miners yielding crap results its hard to auto cash out that often either. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:32:01
Yeah it'd be nice if there were expiration dates on these so if people don't redeem them in 60 days, it automatically gets transferred back to your account or something.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:44:02
They dont have to be mutually exclusive. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:07:48
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:41:27
Well I'd love to know too. Its not that insecure of a password. 8 characters with numbers and capitals. I secure most of my high value accounts with 16 character passwords. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:38:42
2FA should be mandatory for people who have large amounts in online wallets. Additionally you should try to enable the 2FA for withdraws too. 
Finally I like Eclipse MCs feature of 24 delay after change in email or withdraw address. This would allow time for any owner to take action if indeed their account still got compromised. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:24:25
My question is although it's very feasible to target a phone and steal stuff, why would it be YOUR phone? Why would anyone know your phone has bitcoins and to target your phone specifically for bitcoins? There's billions of phones out there, and if anything, the easy target would be passwords, credit card information, SSNs, etc.
I mean think of it this way. How many people have spreadsheets of passwords? Many? How many actually encrypt that file on their computer, or just call it Password.xls? There's so many targets out there.
I'm not saying it's not possible, it just sounds rare that a phone would be that easily compromised and someone would instantly target a bitcoin wallet.
Forgive me for my ignorance, but are most of these issues actually security issues, or most of these "I lost XYZ bitcoins" more a "I sent them to the wrong place" issue?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:44:15
How do you switch between the two at Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:19:53
I guess the thing is I hear a lot of scare stories here and it's like cold storage is the only way to go, but to me that's the same as putting your money in a mattress, no? I have sizable investment accounts here and there, and I'm not panicking. Granted, I may feel differently because people here are investing a lot of money into Bitcoin, while I'm a miner, so I guess it's less of a deal if my stash goes up in flames.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:32:08
I realize that, but what I'm asking is that what about a randomly generated passphrase by LastPass? Why words?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:39:58
Meaningful being....? $500? $1000? $5000?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:07:17
but it's impossible to get USD out of Gox?
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:00:28
Agreed, but if you're gonna go tinfoil hat, then you might as well go paper wallet or cold storage or whatever at that point.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:15:11
Yup, definitely use Authy. For the full tinfoil hatter, this might not be acceptable that they backup your keys, but you need Password + Text Message + E-Mail confirmation in order for Authy to be restored.
This was concern  when I started using it with Blockchain knowing that if you lose your password, you're screwed on Blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:56:09
People keep saying this stuff over and over again, but in the end with open source, how many people are looking at it? Are you, the average user looking at the source? Are you verifying that when you download the app, that it's built from the source? Do you build from source yourself?
I feel like people just keep saying this over and over again because it's the cool thing to say, not because anyone believes LastPass is actually flawed and has a backdoor.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:29:57
Agreed, I get what you mean. My point was that since all the bots are checking words, wouldn't it be better to go and choose a passphrase that's random characters, that not all the bots are focusing on?
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:00:16
So regarding Blockchain, how secure is it? If I use a secure 16 digit password + 2FA, isn't it pretty secure?
After all it's just as secure as say my money at Wells Fargo, no?
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:22:06
Question to all Bitcoin fans. Do you think it's safer to keep money in Blockchain wallet or Coinbase wallet isntead of Android? I understand offline wallets, but in terms of convenience, for some money to be in a hot wallet, wouldn't one of those online sites be far better than an Android device?
There's just too much risk in Android. Rooted devices especially. I'm guessing OP is a ROM flashaholic like me and while I've managed to keep a consistent Whatsapp backup from 2010 =&gt; last month I accidentally wiped my phone one day and I lost everything on /sdcard.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:09:48
Pshh I was mining in early 2011 and my miner would break down for MONTHS at a time. I was like ehhhh who cares, I'll get to it in a few weeks to reboot it because it was hidden away in a storage room. Man. I kept saying the same thing even well into 2012 after the mid 2011 crash. So sad.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:46:13
Hey OP, can I ask a question?
Have you tried "Move to a different phone" option in the [Google 2FA security settings page?](
I personally have not used Google Authenticator much, as I use Authy instead, but I'd like to know how this compares to Authy backups.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:36:27
Of course Authy isnt open sourced so if you have a tinfoil hat on, you could argue that maybe there's a backdoor, blah blah blah but if you're storing anything online, you're likely not TOO worried about that anyway because the NSA doesn't need a backdoor to your Authy account. They'll just get a backdoor into Coinbase.
I just feel this is a much better app given PIN protection. I hate the idea of my Google Authenticator app completely open to any intruder.
