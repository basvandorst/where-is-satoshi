Just wait for Lightning Network and send request to your exchange to implement Segwit and LN. In the meantime watch price go through the floor. It's that simple.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:56:00
There is more to it: to pay as little fees as possible you and all LN users need to connect to as few hubs as possible. Preferably 1 giant hub. Then the payment system is centralized and it starts to be possible to control money flow within Bitcoin network and apply any sort of regulations.

Now that you have found a way for earning income just waiting, you can start thinking how to make your life longer so you can make bigger gains :) Take a look at studies of anti-aging and longevity. This is really awesome stuff and probably going to be the next big thing after crypto.

Yes, then you will have to choose: pay less fees and freeze more funds in one channel at a time, or fund less and pay more in transaction fees. Still you don't get nearly free transactions, you pay for them in different way - by freezing funds in channel.

And still this incentive must have better cost/reward ratio than moving to other coins out there. Otherwise using other coins will be the preferred way of getting around problems with BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:59:46
There is still over 100 years to do the transition from now, before block reward drops to 0. Creating fee economy in 8th year of existence may as well kill the project because of too low throughput compared to every other coin on the market.

Generate your keys using 3rd party, open-hardware HWRNG instead of relying on those embedded in Intel processors or hardware wallets. There are nice open-hardware solutions like OneRNG or NeuG avaliable from FSF.

Strong pro-LN argument. Indeed. Maybe at this point I should disclose that I'm also interested in Ethereum, Dash and Zcash? In case that changes your perspective.

Great feeling to know, that someone else understands it as well!

It did. Because people believed it will do something, they acted accordingly. This is the mechanism behind self-fulfilling prophecies in markets.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:57:26
It is like saying that anyone can mine Bitcoin. Yes, indeed. But only those with sufficient funds will actually successfully do that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:27:13
Well there is this other way: make Bitcoin resolution larger so instead of being divisible to 10e8 parts (satoshis) it can be divided in e.g. 10e16 parts. Now you can set much smaller fee.
Acutally I'm not against 2nd or 3rd layer (still making my mind up about that), but this is the simplest solution I can think of to your problem.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:29:47
Because even in this world there is limit to stupidity? No one with clear mind should buy after 60x price rise in 2 years.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:54:54
Actually I don't even expect Bitcoin can maintain its price from beginning of 2017 when transactions are not cleared as they arrive.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:44:51
In case of symmetrical flows: yes. But how often do you expect people to send the same amounts in exactly opposite directions? I think this is very special case, not representative for real life transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:16:31
What should worry you is why there is such big pressure against raising block size now, when LN is not operating yet?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:27:09
We are the market and we are expected to sort it out.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:03:54
Yes, but then how many people you think will want to treat you as your hub? Why would they want to connect to you and pay transaction fee when your liquidity is so low? People will generally want hubs with most liquidity, so they can flow most of their transactions without opening additional channels and paying additional fees. That's where centralization creeps in.

No one is going to downvote you. This post will be deleted by mods first, as mine did.
Products like Lightning are made to be sold. The more pressure you have to buy it, the better for sellers. Bigger blocks would only give you more time to think about real consequences of LN.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:40:29
The problem is that even now network is held in a state, where it will not be possible to get around hubs for most of transactions. I wouldn't expect it to change when traffic will be 100 times bigger.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:04


Depends on meaning of "free". As a node you have to pay transaction fees for opening and closing channels. Also you need to have funds to keep in open channels. Having your money locked in channel and not being able to do anything else with them is anything but costless. The cost is just moved somewhere else.


Exactly this. Hubs will be points of centralization like exchanges are now. They will suffer from regulation, they will be forced to conduct AML and KYC rules. This is not freedom that decentralized money promised.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:42:08
Ask the question the other way: why should anyone disclose valuable information to you? Because you will pay? Someone who has 10 times your money will pay even more. And this 10x richer guy will demand from his source monopoly on information. Because the more people will know how market will behave, the less any particular man is able to monetize this information. Trading is a negative sum game. People make money only at the cost of other people. So they in general won't share this information (if they have it) unless you will pay them more, than anyone else is willing to pay. Except if they are able to use this information with their own capital - then they won't tell anyone.

Of course they are not guaranteed and only based on past performance. But this is acually how people decide where to invest. I'm not saying that taxation is negligible. I'm only saying that a) tax to reward ratio based on historical performance is still better for crypto than stocks b) that tax on gains is of lower importance if gains are an order of magnitude larger in crypto than stocks.
Furthemore let's distinguish real returns (after taxes) from what average man's perception of gains is. People often cannot do simple math and make investment based on their assumptions. I think that crypto is hot topic now that it proved returns in area of 1000s of percents. Nobody asks the question what amount of taxes he will need to pay on exiting from crypto. When they are already in and start thinking about exiting it will be to late. They will have the choice between paying 45% tax or staying with crypto for who knows how long. That's why I think large taxes are in favor of crypto in long term.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:31:13
There is no need to deny that: you may be quite right. But important part of Bitcoin is Freedom. Freedom to do whatever you want with your own money. It is this unnecessary enforcement of one's morality on everybody else (that you try to conduct in your post) that is driving people away from centralized money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:38
"Regulation is not always bad thing, especially if it works in my very interest at this particular moment."
If you want regulated market, get out of crypto and stop crying.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:44:33
Regarding the case you described: people knew in advance that Bitcon Cash fork is going to happen. The exact date of fork was known. They knew that if fork happens and they don't own their coins they will be dependent on exchange to release forked coins. Yet decided to leave them in someone else's hands. Who is to blame? Why someone should be held responsible for thinking in owner's interest if owners are not doing that by themselves?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:06:22
Would you mind to show txid to show what you mean by low fee?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:14:54
This. Also don't put much trust in any software. You cannot assess how secure is a database created by any software, including LastPass/KeePass. They will most probably secure your keys from your neighbour mechanic, but once this database gets online you are leaving it in hands of people that know and can do more that the public knows today.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:12:27
They are taxing exiting from Bitcoin, not investing. They only speed up what would happen anyway :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:51:07
Maybe. But at the cost of centralization of money flow and - possibly - application of KYC/AML rules for transactions on LN.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:07:48
Letting it die slow and painful death rather than keeping alive.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:17:31
Yes, but then again: when you are facing decision whether to buy crypto or not you have to choose between paying 20% tax from hundreds percents of gains or not gaining at all. So taxes probably won't hold you back from investing. Only from further trading/withdrawing from crypto investment. So my points hold.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:55:34
Allowing people for opt-in is ok. Releasing highly recommended functionality and not providing it in reference client - not so.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:10:14
Ok. But in such case your payment network is not decentralized anymore. You can be subject to KYC/AML and any other nasty regulations. There will be someone else who can control your money. Just like in banks today.

@_date: 2017-12-19 19:28:36


And pay transaction fee for that? Where's saving from such operation?


That's my point: to allow most of the transactions to be LN, all the funds must be locked in LN channels. The more you want to save on fees, the more you need to lock at once to minimize fee per money amount. The more parties you will trade with, the more channels you need to open and more cash will be frozen. You may propose now, that you will need to only open one channel to large LN hub. That is possible, but mind that large LN hubs mean money flow centralization with possiblility of introducing KYC/AML policies (like exchanges have currently). Then your decentralized payment system is no longer free and decentralized. It is under control by 3rd party.

Before Mt. Gox - around April - there was more legitimate bubble. Current one can be similar to that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:57:56
If current intention of devs is to transfer wealth from users to miners, then fee market works as intended. Agree.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:42
Forks, fees and craze is inevitable. Waiting for transaction days to confirm is not.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:30:17


It is not a problem of honesty. The protocol ensures that. The problem is with concentration and the risk that state will want to take advantage of it to control LN network. The less there is hubs or higher capital requirements to run hub - the bigger risk.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:12:49
We have blocks of 4M weight units. This is equal to around 2MB in case of block consisting of only Segwit transactions or 1MB for block containing only non-Segwit transactions.
Weight is computed as follows:
weight = tx_size_with_witness + 3*tx_size_without_witness
On average tx_size_without_witness is 1/3 of the transaction size.
Non-Segwit transaction has tx_size_with_witness equeal to tx_size_without_witness
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:02:22
It does not at the moment.
Centralization: "I need to connect to the largest hub to avoid creating many costly channels or the need to reconnect frequently. Otherwise it is going to cost me big amount of fees (each channel needs 1 fee to open and 2nd to close)".
Lack of security: LN node needs access to unencrypted keys all the time, because it needs to operate without user intervention.

I'm only sure that however big amout of regulation will happen to crypto, it will not prevent misconduct in markets. See how financial institutions are regulated in any possible way. Yet they always find a way to fail in some new, unregulated way. As a byproduct we have continuosly rising cost of these regulations, but global scale failures happen as they always did. So what's the point of that? People need to be educated where to look for risks and how to avoid them. Regulation only creates false sense of safety.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:11:52
The biggest believers are those, that are invested in Bitcoin. They don't want see past it in case there is something uncomfortable to see. They aren't even allowed to talk freely about that in this sub. Critical posts are being deleted and wisdom downvoted. Unless you seek religion, don't believe everything you read here.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:16:41
Bitcoin is meant to solve problems, not introduce them and then require support.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:10:45
But then how LN transaction differs from sending everything in one transaction without LN? If you create channel only to pay everything in that channel at once, it will be at least as expensive as not using LN at all.

It does, especially when you know you could have avoided it.

But because Bitcoiners don't have LTC by default, they need to go and buy some. At the same time most of them have BCH, so using it is effortless.

In 2013 two bubbles started forming. One around April and second around December. Second one was indeed caused and collapsed because of Mt. Gox. But the first one was more natural, caused by 1st reward halving. Current situation is more similar to the first bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:04:14
You have 2 options:
- invest in stocks with (at best) hundreds percent of gains and 20% tax on exit
- invest in Bitcoin with thousands percents of gains and 45% tax on exit.
Which one you choose?

I didn't mention BCH at any point. These are your words. I'm only telling you what I think about this solution after reading LN reference.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:02:01
With mempool being crowded as it is now - sounds resonable. But in absolute terms it is high compared to different blockchains or even Bitcoin months ago, when blocks were not completely full.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:03:33
And that is only fraction of cost. Next cost is all the money that will need to be frozen in those channels. You won't be able to trade it or use for any other purpose. Then there is cost of centralization of money flows to few large LN hubs that will allow forcing all this nasty KYC and AML stuff on users, that we already have to deal with on exchanges. Isn't that too much?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:05:56
You should also run LN hub. But watch out your private keys.

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:16:17
Not for long. After few transactions they are zeroed and the problem of mempool congestion solves by itself.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:50:09
Given the architecture of LN, transactions within it cannot be both potentially free and decentralized. Choose one.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:01:35
The problem is that both sides of the transaction have to support LN. While it may not be a big problem on user side, implementing LN by exchanges and wallet providers just for the single coin of BTC may not be cost effective use of their resources. See how long it takes for Segwit to be implemented by exchanges and wallet providers.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:20:50
Incentive is a prize you get when doing something better.
Not being able to make transaction and actually not having choice because LN is not functional - is a PUNISHMENT. I hope people responsible for that will pay with their own money for taking such narrow-minded steps.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:05:42
Call it however you want :) But once they are assigned to particular channel you can only spend it in that channel.
