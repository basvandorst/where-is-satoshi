It's a funny comment considering it's hosted on github. Gits distinguishing factor being it is decentralised

I like this view. Gives a different perspective. 
Bitcoin is libertarian as it allows for absolute property rights. And also is a new system as we don't have to trust in market forces to create a good outcome we can rely on mathematics and computer science

I don't see this centralised currency being efficient. Efficient like one person leading a country is the most efficient or one company producing all the electricity in the world is efficient

Testnet is more secure than the dao so no they could not steal them

They are not signaling CSV anymore?

It's not a problem with sha256. It's the way bitcoin headers are constructed allows the bug
Asicboost is 100% a bug for every reason. It incourages mining empty blocks and breaks miner incentives to add transactions 
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:34:41
There's good sources if you look. I'm too lazy. It came out in court documents 
@_date: 2017-04-15 03:24:31
Bitmain with asic boost has the best margins. So it would likely send everyone bankruptcy except Juhan Wu
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:02:06
It's true. In a blockchain with no transactions it is completely impossible to double spend. Can't argue with that. And you also have no bitcoin payments. No private keys or anything. It's genius

It's really not a legitimate way to test software. "Release the code and then see if any user's money is stolen". Code reviews and code tests are the way to go. If you want to incentivise people with money you can do that with a boundy program

The ones that let you control the fee also overcharge you. And none have replace by fee that would let you pay the exact amount

Theres a scroll bug on your website. When I touch scroll on chrome droid the site opens random pages. Maybe use onclick not touchend or use a fast click plugin

Protocols have zero to do with usability. Do you know that TCP is a poor protocol for YouTube? You don't realise because it's abstracted away. Like our weak early attempts to abstract bitcoins protocol with "wallets" and "transactions" Protocols are abstract technical things and the likelihood of it effect a well crafted interface for buying and selling is near zero. It's more important how developers have to interface with it.

Yep they scammed you. Mycelium is really going downhill. I no longer recommend it to people

Was anyone bothered that the price went up as soon as Antpool was hacked? Shows how replaceable they are. It really has little effect on the network since someone more competent can quickly fill the void

Bitcoin already has testnet is for testing. Nothing better than a year 2 year open code review process and running the code on testnet

They were definitely anti Core. Don't know if they are pro Bitcoin Unlimited. I doubt anyone will admit they supported the BU fork at this point

In every industrialised country the central banks determine the interest rate. The politically independent central banks set the rate that banks can borrow from

Actually, no. Also no.
WTF how is a slow release, ALL client update quick or easy!

"only [broken] math and consensus rules" bitcoin mining only works because of incentives. And when a bug creates an incentive to mine empty blocks it need to be fixed immediately. Asic boost is 100% a bug and a flaw in the protocol

What is displayed on the interface is the only data the server will give you. Location distance to 2 significant figures then rounded to the closest 0.1 kilometers from the location your user is positioned.

Only replace by fee transactions should be used at this point. Otherwise transactions can always get stuck. It's a pity very few services support it

This wouls be a great feature for trading. Instant, free transfers between exchanges using litecoin
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:02:17
Miners only job is to provide order to transactions. They don't add any vague "security". They create an unforgeable ordering or ledger. Without transactions included they aren't adding value except adding a little pow isn't that useful
