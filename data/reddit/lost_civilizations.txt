its is 43.98 sat/B.  Ive been waiting 4 hours and its super annoying
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:09:17
for the record, it took 5 hours

If I sent a transaction with a .0005 fee where would that be located on that chart?  How long should I expect it to take?

And huge bull runs started a few days after each

Guess i didnt fully understand the halvening. :) thanks for the color!

Still takes some knowledge to set up a virtual server or hardware, right?

agree.  Just wondering if that theory is fact

its just a day dream then

How are node operators alerted if something changes?  If the core repository is say 100,000 lines of code, does it present the node operator with a list of changes made like Github?
@_date: 2019-08-25 05:21:25
Why make btc open source if other forks are bound to fail?
@_date: 2019-08-25 02:55:22
How would the human running the node actually catch the difference if a hacker did make a change to the core repository?  Does the software continuously check off certain variables and alert the miner via a user interface message if something looks off?
@_date: 2019-08-25 05:24:47
Do all node operators mine btc since they have the software running on the node?
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:52:27
guess this answers my question
@_date: 2019-08-25 03:44:08


If a miner isn't running a node, what does a miner do?
@_date: 2019-06-06 02:36:41

The two guys on the left have a funny reaction when the guy talking mentions the word "Crazy"  lol
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:46:45
So miners validate blocks and send them to the btc network where they are added to the blockchain by a consensus of nodes?
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:14:14
Can you explain a little more?
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:47:15
Keep dragging them in!  Can't wait to see them lose 40% of their cash once the btc whales drop the price. 12000 back to 7000.

All part of the wealth transfer. Suck in the traditional investors and then dump btc
@_date: 2019-08-25 00:54:48
great example.
So in essence, since all the nodes currently have software that states the max is 21 million, the hacker would have to go all the way back to the first software release and make the change to 50.  However since all current nodes have downloaded software that states the max is 21, then the alarm would go off if their node sees the max was changed to 50. That sound about right?
@_date: 2019-12-27 21:44:04
subtle difference. thanks!  
@_date: 2019-12-27 21:46:27
So then inflation is good for high ticket asset prices like stocks and real estate that benefit the wealthy? How is average joe supposed to buy these assets during inflationary times as the prices keep rising to extremes? Printing money out of thin air only enriches the rich.
side note: excellent user name
@_date: 2019-12-22 06:05:17
staking rewards are in the forms of transaction fees paid by the users, no?  The total supply of coins remains fixed
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:36:50
That sounds super sketchy. Komodo is just covering up their fuckup.
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:35:31
Thought you were referencing elizabeth theranos for a sec. :/
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:45:12
what securities do the banks own which were given as collateral to the fed for the repo "loan" (aka free money)?
@_date: 2019-12-27 21:00:07
ok. but why.  what is an example.  In the states a $1 = $1
@_date: 2019-12-22 04:10:43


Are you referring to the hybrids coins that will continue to release tokens via POW?  Or are they releasing pre-mined coins over a future date range?  I am aware of some coins that have not done any pre-mining and have distributed all coins.  I am trying to infer if these type of POS coins are more scarce than btc at present date.
@_date: 2019-12-23 04:54:08
haha. bringing out the classics
@_date: 2019-12-22 08:47:01
Cost is different depending on the price of the coin. Competition is in who buys it first and is ahead of the pack.
@_date: 2019-12-22 15:45:02
my logic was based on the definition "Scarcity refers to the limited availability of a commodity, which may be in demand in the market. "   More scarce equals less abundant equals less future supply.  Maybe my logic is off
@_date: 2019-12-27 21:02:02


Can you explain in more detail?
@_date: 2019-12-23 05:16:03
No need. I thought it was on point and funny to boot
@_date: 2019-12-27 21:29:15
good analogy.
Except in reality, it is probably that when the money supply is $200, the wealthiest person (person closest to the money printing) got $160 and the 3 in the middle got $10 and the 5 others got $2.
Now in the real world that means easy money for bankers, but by the time it gets to the average joe the cost of money is expensive via interest rates. So average joe gets fucked both ways.  Harder to get easy money and cost of goods is higher.
@_date: 2019-12-23 18:12:51
If it hasn't been discovered then it can't be part of the circulating supply.  Or I must be way off in how I understand the definition of supply.
@_date: 2019-12-22 16:12:15
less future supply?  In relation to gold, if there was less and less gold to mine on earth wouldn't that asset become more scarce? or is the correct term less abundant?
@_date: 2019-12-27 22:14:10


can you elaborate?
@_date: 2019-12-22 15:50:43
hmm, I'm starting to view scarcity differently now.
@_date: 2019-12-22 08:38:11
good points, however there are costs to stakers.  They put up their own capital to forge and secure the network. Similar to how early miners invested in a lot of equipment and electricity usage.
And the fact that POS doesn't use as much electricity is a benefit in some regards for the average forger.  I would think you'll have a hard time competing with chinese mining farms with your single ASICS machine for btc mining.

the attorney sounds legit /s

@_date: 2019-12-23 16:36:19
sorry, was that a question or statement? I think I was assuming that the gold that hasn't been discovered yet is not part of the circulating supply.
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:23:48
exactly.

@_date: 2019-04-26 01:23:20
Not exactly the most legit attorney ever. Banks probably paid her off

ya sorry about that. I caught it after people had already made comments.

Moving usd from banks onto bitcoin exchanges to buy btc
@_date: 2018-07-02 23:11:45
Was guessing miners could decode the transaction amount to verify the payer owns the amount they intend to pay
@_date: 2018-07-01 20:05:39
I was thinking the system would keep private data on a public(decentralized) system.  I guess public and decentralized aren't synonyms in my interpretation
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:26:47
i agree with the retracement theses to around and maybe even little below 4000.  think itll happen over next 4 months
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:45:12
my point was in a world where much of the population owns bitcoin, it would be like shooting fish in a barrel for theifs
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:59:36
so institutions are just going to buy to speculate with no intention of owning the actual bitcoin keys?  so basically like an etf?
@_date: 2019-05-05 03:19:30
excellent. thanks
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:52:37


what if the banks cuts off access to your safety deposit box?  I assume in a future world banks aren't going to be happy if customers dont need them anymore since btc will be used more
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:25:53
just an funny observation of body language

@_date: 2019-05-05 01:44:17
just wanting to set up decoy account for added protection.  Wondering if its possible to create multiple accounts on one trezor.
But in theory, if was held up at gun point I could give access to only a decoy account on my trezor while all other accounts remain unknown.
Or do I need to have multiple trezors that use the same seed and private key? One trezor would be the decoy and the others would be where the main btc stash is
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:40:24
so you are saying the people buying btc dont care about news?  or is the trajectory of btc price based on mathematics, physics, and game theory?
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:20:09
How do they do it?
