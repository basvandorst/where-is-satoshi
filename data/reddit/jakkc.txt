You're missing my point.
Ultimately, I'm sitting on the fence here - but I don't think I can clearly see whats on either side of the fence.
This is a reflection of my subjective experience during this period.

Well I'd say it's not, I'd say its quite hard to find information regarding the 'Satoshi's original vision' argument. I've been looking for weeks and not really found anything until a chance comment in a thread.

You're literally the most pretentious person who has walked into this conversation. Everyone else has been quite helpful, you just came in here to flex your 'I know more about the topic than you' muscles. The reason I came in here was to learn off guys like you but with that attitude I'd prefer you keep your mouth shut. kthxbye.

Look at the other comments in this thread for tips from your peers on how to have a constructive conversation.
Your loaded language only serves to antagonise, rather than contribute: 'victim of buzzwords', 'nice effort you made', 'thanks for sharing what impressions outsiders get' - you're a total prick mate, and I'd bet my BTC holdings that you have severe issues integrating in social situations.
Enjoy your pornhub, cheetos and chart stalking cycle. Go troll on twitter - the 140 character limit will better conceal your ignorant affront.

I'm trying to foster a conversation here buddy.
Let's engage with each other rather than making empty points.
Why do you object to BCC - I'm genuinely trying to learn.

If you have the time I'd love you to unpack your response a bit more. Your response assumes the op - me, is as well informed in the matter as yourself, so you've made a few sweeping comments and relied on a presumed knowledge on my behalf.
1) Who are these small groups as far as you're concerned and what are their political affiliations?
2) Where does BCC stand in this equation and do you have any respect for their position on honouring Satoshi's original vision?
3) Are you a technical person and do you believe that one scaling solution is superior to the other based on your technical understanding?
4) I don't really understand what your final sentence mean - why is BIP148 the effect of people not feeling good about other Bitcoin clones?

Thank you, I look forward to your response.

Thank you, I believe we're on the same page here! It's alarming how hard it is to get straight answers - generally, people are responding with condensed nuggets of assumed knowledge or patronising shills.
The thing that concerns me the most is the 'wipeout' that the UASF brings - what are the practical implications of historical transactions disappearing from the blockchain? Can they be safely discarded on the grounds that those transactions are final, or does this open up the ability for maleficent activity by those who control blockchain? Does this make the Bitcoin blockchain now mutable like Ethereum's? 
I'm not really asking you these questions in hope of an answer, I'm just thinking out loud!

This is the problem right here for me.
It's really hard to get bipartisan answers.
Do you really think you need to provide a definition for capitalism to me? C'mon, I'm just trying to get unbiased answers here but it seems like you've already chosen your side! Where my fence brothers at?
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:58:27
In your description the 'core team' are those in favour of SegWit2x and would be considered Blockstream affiliated? Whilst the 'new group of others' are those who believe the core team are trying to turn Bitcoin into a 'settlement layer' rather than 'digital cash' as it was once envisioned?
Why would you say the 'others' are capitalistic and would you say the core team are not?

So by your logic we are just waiting for all bitcoin users to get computer science competence and then we've safely arrived in the new bitcoin paradigm? I waited a day so you could read back your stupid comment with fresh eyes.
You go on to tell me to read some Wikipedia as a solution to my computer science shortcomings - lol.
You know nothing of my background friend. The topic I raised really doesn't concern computer science - what I'm really concerned with is the spread and suppression of information and the overview of the bitcoin civil war. More social science based than computer science based. How old are you?
