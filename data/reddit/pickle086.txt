Yes, it's not hard to use, but running a full node and lightning node will come with certain costs.

No one exactly knows as some say it is the real estate investors, some say the hedge funds, on the other hand, some say it's lightning network. Who would know?

That's so obvious I mean volatility of Bitcoin is much higher than the volatility of gold.

Yeah, Bitcoin is the original archetype for the cryptocurrency and its large user base has helped it rise higher. But there are good ideas on other coins too.

Yeah, it would be even easier to see how the politicians get donations since every transaction is publicly available on the blockchain. Good idea but it looks more like a marketing move.

 The majority of cryptocurrencies can only be bought with Ethereum or Bitcoin so you have to buy one of those before you can purchase the  smaller coins. So far I would stick to Bitcoin or maybe Ethereum.

Wow didn't know about this! Awesome idea. But, honestly, if it's a gift it should be their own to decide, kinda. Right?
I know it's better for them not to, but if it's a gift, they should decide... :)

You could make those. It would be pretty easy, just depends how big!
And one day the euro sign would represent Ethereum, and the dollar sign will one day represent sharding, not USD x) ah future!
