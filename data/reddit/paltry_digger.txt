3 months old... no other activity... writes a comment to sarcastically put down these accusations... all checks out to me.

If you want to try your hand at this, I've created a [treasure hunt]( with 5000 bits up for grab :)
I've simplified it a little by using [WarpWallet]( where you can input a string and it outputs an address.
Good luck!

A boy asked his bitcoin-investing father for $10.
Father: $9.82? What do you need $10.08 for?
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:33:06
They do run a bounty program which clearly states their rewards: 
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:44:05
Thanks for the $1.99!
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:29:54
Charity, please!
@_date: 2015-06-06 22:07:15
Your reasoning is that because it's down, it'll certainly go up. It won't.
It could, but it has an equal chance of going down and crashing. It's a high risk investment and as good a time as ever, if you want to get into it.
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:34:27
They offer a bug bounty program which states that they give $5,000 for that type of vulnerability:

I do agree, I'm a white hat hacker myself. I'm guessing that we're not hearing all of this story. Let's see what Coinable responds with.
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:55:48
Fellow white-hat hacker here.
I feel that coinbase handled this well. This is a valid exploit, so should be awarded the full $5,000, but didn't compromise coinbase's security.
This guy was just making claims that he could steal millions of dollars and people backed him up without reason... welcome to reddit.
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:43:51
I think he asked for charity :)
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:07:13
Ok, you can get infinite money in your vault. Then what? He said right there that you can't withdraw money.

So why exactly would I need to sign up for Bitpay to donate Bitcoin?

Just added something, let me know what you think! It adds the bitcoin logo to the person doing the tipping. It might be impossible to add it to the recipient.
Here's an example:
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:29:56
I know, sadly it didn't go through for some reason :(
@_date: 2015-01-17 15:43:17
Right now I only have 1 app up, but I have a few more in the works. It's called [Simply Tanks]( and it's a little game inspired by Wii Tanks.
I've experimented with Swift but I haven't made the transition yet from Objecive C, although I hear it's much simpler.
Do you plan to make more apps or just expand this one?
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:44:59
Thankfully there's now a bot that comments on every one of its posts!
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:03:36

Sadly this will only work in or subreddits that implement this styling.
Who knows, maybe will add it!

Yeah, it's tough because all I'm modifying is CSS, but I'll try to do something like that. It would be really cool!
@_date: 2015-01-31 21:41:16
This will only work on subreddits with the styling, like Thanks for the tip though!

I'm also 14 years old and I also make apps, so the title jumped out at me. Congrats on making it and the downloads!
When did you start programming and what languages have you used? Also, what language did you use to make this app?
I started at 12 with Java and gradually made my way to Objective C, where I am now.
Nice job once again! 1000 bits EDIT: Also, if you need help with anything, let me know! :)

Changetip is no longer shadowbanned.
@_date: 2016-01-14 01:31:13
According to the Changetip app, they have at least 100,000 registered account. Note that that's different from the number of active users, which we don't know.
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:16:25
Never heard of bitquick, but it looks awesome! There needs to be a solid and easy way to buy and sell bitcoins for bitcoin to be successful. Happy birthday!
@_date: 2015-07-22 23:39:45
It is not an illegal lottery. Promising to pay a value is signing a contract, people are suggested to donate but not required.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:08:25
The high majority of all money donated is from a single dollar donated, probably around 90%. Comments that donate more than a dollar will get voted to the top, so that's why you see so many higher donations.
Most people who donate give a dollar, and around 50% of all donations are using changetip. You're right in the number of people donating, it's around 1500-2000, and more as time goes on.
If you look at the [tread]( there are hundreds of donations using changetip.
@_date: 2015-07-18 13:18:12
Also a mod.
We leave the entry thread open for 24 hours. You can comment there to enter. After it closes, we publicly release a list of the top level comment ids, in a certain order. We then generate a random index using the blockchain, so it's provably fair. We contact the winner and they post a thread, where you can donate directly to them using Bitcoin (Changetip's used a lot), Dogecoin, Litecoin, PayPal, or Google wallet.
Bitcoin's worked the best.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:37:48
Then main method for donating to millionaire makers winners is bitcoin, so this is some great exposure for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:03:05
Mycelium is available for iPhone, and is one of the best wallets IMO. You can search for it on the app store.
If you have a bank account, you can link it to [Coinbase]( which is one of the most trusted exchanges out there. After you buy bitcoin from your bank account, you can send it to your mycelium wallet.
Buying from a trusted bitcoin exchange like Coinbase is going to be the easiest and safest way for smaller amounts.
@_date: 2016-02-23 04:57:02
Great to be a part of :)
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:55:55
I was including changetip with Bitcoin :)
If you look through the thousand comments there, almost every one has a changetip tip.
@_date: 2016-02-06 22:53:42
They (hopefully) just have that for the demo, and the actual product is more secure. I'm taking a look at the code for the extension now, I'll update this on how it works.

Yeah, it's the number of tips from  But that only takes the public tips, and it's not accurate by any means.

I have nothing against being critical of Bitcoin -- it's important to be critical, and this sub isn't critical enough.
That being said, is a sub of trolls. They completely deny the possibility of Bitcoin working, while it clearly has real world use.
Maybe start a subreddit where being critical of Bitcoin is the goal, but don't identify yourself with trolls. People are criticizing you not because you're being critical of Bitcoin, but rather that you are moderating a sub that denies Bitcoin altogether.
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:47:15
Let's test it out, shall we :)
EDIT: Got the link, worked perfectly! Nice job.
@_date: 2015-04-15 23:45:49
That's exactly what it is! Every day you can comment in the [distribution thread]( to receive your share.
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:17:18
I know you've used tiphound before, how about posting a tiphound link in with a description explaining how tiphound works, and then you can also comment on your post explaining it. The key is to show how it works, rather than just posting the link. It would be fun to try it out!
@_date: 2015-04-15 23:20:59
These stats are for the past week. [Here's the all time stats]( Not sure why the OP is presenting it just for the past week.
@_date: 2015-04-12 12:32:30
Yep, people who don't repay loans are done.
@_date: 2015-04-25 21:19:04
Just leave a comment in the stickied thread :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 01:30:10
Well, yes, it could go up. But it is a huge risk, as it could also go down. If people could predict what happens with Bitcoin, then everyone would be buying it.
@_date: 2015-04-10 22:09:51
The title is extremely misleading. Coinbase didn't send the emails as the title makes it seem.
@_date: 2015-04-12 12:33:26
There is still mod approval, so making a new account for this isn't as easy as it seems.
@_date: 2015-04-27 00:52:28
Have you checked out :)
@_date: 2015-04-12 05:27:39
So we can't force anyone to pay, of course. That's why we calculate someone's loan based off of their karma and account history. If someone weren't to pay, then their entire account would lose its credibility.
@_date: 2015-04-12 05:26:40
The only way we can protect against people walking away with a loan is their account. We assign a value to their account using karma and age, because if they don't pay back then their account is no longer credible anywhere.
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:03:11
Hmm... 877? :)
@_date: 2015-04-12 12:49:29
Yeah, what if the formula takes into account the amount of loans paid back? And if the user doesn't pay back a loan, they aren't eligible for a loan anymore.
We could also limit the amount of loans out at once. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 23:21:44
[Here's the all time graph]( I don't know why the original is just for the past week.
@_date: 2015-04-12 19:09:21
It's entirely BTC -- if you request a loan for 1000 bits, you'll pay back the same amount (with interest) in bits.
@_date: 2015-04-15 23:22:54
isn't a fair loan subreddit, that's is a project for distributing a basic income to users.
@_date: 2015-04-12 05:03:01
Right now the loans don't change depending on how many loans you've taken, but that's a good idea.
It's calculated based on your karma and your account age, the max is 100,000 bits.
Glad to hear that you like it!
@_date: 2015-09-18 23:46:48
A millionaire is our goal :)
Tons of people also donate using changetip. Changetip + bitcoin averages about 50% of the total donations, last drawing was about a third bitcoin and changetip combined.
@_date: 2015-04-16 00:52:21
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:17:53
That guys a fraud, only giving gold :(
@_date: 2015-04-12 06:21:41
The formula is:
    max(min((AccountAge - 30)/365, 1), 0)*max(MIN((CombinedKarma - 50)/1000, 1), 0)*CurrentBalance
To see what you'd get, make a post requesting a loan. It won't commit you to anything.
@_date: 2015-04-26 23:45:33
The winner's preparing their thread, just wait a little :)
@_date: 2015-04-12 12:58:31
Right now I can look and see that someone didn't pay back, but I'll add it to the formula.
@_date: 2015-04-10 22:13:27
Yes, but your title implies that the company Coinbase sent the emails.
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:32:46
Haha, that was autocorrect's doing. I meant to say TipHound, not typhoon.
So you'll need to find a place to host your file. You can try [tinyupload]( or use dropbox. There's tons of other sites I'm sure, google file hosting sites.
Then, go to  Enter the url of where your file's hosted, and describe how tiphound works (this is important so people know they'll get a file). Then, after you upload it to tiphound, post the link to It's also a good idea to leave a comment explaining that people should tip with change tip to get the story.
Let me know how it goes out :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 12:20:00
I'll take it you replied to the wrong thread here?
Anyways, you would be able to pay back someone's loan, so I'm sure we could find a use for it.
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:20:28
You pretend you're rich by giving $50 in gold :(... Fake
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:53:44
We hate them because they're just that -- a troll sub. They're points aren't valid, they just scream that Bitcoin won't work. Maybe if they gave logical reasoning we would respect them more.
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:24:26
