Will be added! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:19:07
Changed it!
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:35:57
I will explore this, thanks!
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:20:14
That's a good one, will consider to add it somewhere!
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:04:10
Haha, that's a nice compliment, thank you!
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:48:31
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:42:18
We will change it soon to local copies! Thanks
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:36:13
Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:19:03
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:09:32
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:08:17
Thank you very much! Yeah we do, also we use some data from CryptoCompare. I think we will make some changes to which sources we use in the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:26:43
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:30:32
Thank you very much! :)
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:46:10
Thank you! We firstly want to optimize our website, then we will look into mobile apps
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:35:24
Thanks!! Fixed it!
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:06:19
You can always design a proposal for it :P 
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:40:15
Thanks! For me this is the ultimate evidence of the importance of receiving some feedback on the project. We will definitely fix it!
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:35:02
Thanks! Yes, that's a really nice addition. It could be something like a percentage bar.
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:59:05
We will add this in the foreseeable future, thanks anyway!
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:17:44
Thank you for your compliment! Will dive into it!
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:12:20
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:24:41
Ah sorry, I didn't read it correctly. It would be a funny addition, but I agree with you that it maybe isn't adding enough usefulness.
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:12:27
thanks :)
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:03:32
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:27:50
Thank you! Currently we use the CryptoCompare API for our images, but we will change that in the future. So, then we can change the logo.
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:31:30
Yes, we are using them both. I would like to have an all time price history instead of a maximum of 5 years. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:49:17
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:07:56
Thanks!! You can just click once on the green button at the bottom, then you don't have to worry about ever making eye contact with any coin below rank 150 ;)
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:14:56
We fixed it!
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:19:24
Thanks! I still doubt to add it to the table or not. It adds complexity to the table as a whole, and I am not sure if it will add enough value for the majority of our visitors.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:19:46
Added market cap on mobile, when using landscape mode
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:36:01
Yes that's true, but we clean and fill our database every 60 seconds. That's one API request.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:39:45
haha nice, thanks
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:08:08
Thank you !
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:10:37
Thanks! I heard it a couple of times now, so I am considering to change it!
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:03:23
That's great to hear! We've made custom icons for iOS, Android and Windows Mobile (yes, it's still alive!). So after saving Coinranking to your home screen, it will show a perfectly adapted Coinranking icon ;)
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:09:13
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:34:44
I understand your suggestion, but I think an unaligned dollar sign will be a bit weird looking.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:47:20
True, will definitely consider it. For example on landscape mode.
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:28:52
Haha, would definitely be funny, but I like avoiding any partiality ;)
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:04:16
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:30:36
The circulating supply is visible on the specific cryptocurrency pages. Or do you mean adding it to the home page?
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:32:57
Interesting idea. We will first be focussing on the website, but this is interesting enough to create in the future.
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:33:49
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:45:56
Hi! For practical reasons we currently pull data from Coinmarketcap. After we are finished polishing the UI, then we will be focussing more on our data sources.
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:13:36
Yes I definitely agree! Mobile phones are an integral part of our digital lives, so they deserve some love.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:18:59
That's right. We haven't open sourced the project.
It's a nice little improvement, so we've implemented it now. Thanks! ;)
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:48:24
Hi! Thank you! Our list is sorted by market cap and we use a minimum daily trade volume filter at $1000. Our ranking is definitely not finished and we keep trying to improve it where it needs to.
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:34:01
Thank you! Really appreciate it :)
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:38:55
Then we should add a tag to it which states: "not an open source decentralized cryptocurrency". Joking of course. For the moment, we will leave it as it is. If more people really want it to be treated differently, then we could always change our minds!
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:57:44
Thank you for your feedback. We will leave Ripple in our ranking for now, because we like to be open to every cryptocurrency decentralized or open source or not.
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:20:19
Yes, every added piece of information makes the whole table harder to consume. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:44:19
That's a good one! Will consider it for mobile landscape definitely!
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:08:14
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:49:06
Thank you!
We will add the option to choose your preferred currency in the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:44:42
Great to hear! thanks
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:30:18
Yes that could be a feature in the future. Multiple base currencies will definitely be added.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:31:25
That's nice to hear. Add it to your home screen. We've optimized the icons for all different tile sizes. Try it out :p
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:13:24
Thank you for your suggestion. Currently we are considering adding a small tag to pre-mined coins, so that could be a first step.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:20:19
Added market cap on mobile when using landscape mode!
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:24:25
Couldn't be more honored ;) We optimized the 'home screen' icons for Android, iOS and Windows Mobile, so it will look crisp and clear.
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:58:36
Thanks, that's an excellent piece of feedback you've got there haha ;)
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:58:40
Thank you for your compliments and feedback! Yes, we definitely have a roadmap. We are currently exploring a few possibilities of a news/social integration. I think we will build it in the coming few months.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:43:57
Hi spottedmarley, that’s an interesting topic. We don’t store user IP’s in our database, and we don’t send it to ShapeShift. But the IP’s are stored in our server log files. Thanks for the compliment!
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:03:20
Many thanks :D
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:59:58
Thank you! It's nice to have a well integrated exchange in Coinranking itself, so our users can trade their coins while they are watching price info. Also we think that we've made the best mobile buy experience out there. But it's a work in progress of course!
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:00:44
Thank you! Will think about your feedback.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:19:41
Thank you! Yes, those are zero-liquidity coins. I will make it more clear, thanks!
