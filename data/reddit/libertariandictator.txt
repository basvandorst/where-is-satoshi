1. Real scarcity of money, so no central authority creating money out of thin air and causing centralization and abuse of power:

This is what banks have agreed on May 21st. Within four years, real-time payments are possible, payments are credited to the account within five seconds .

Only governments have the power to create a competitor to bitcoin with a better network effect for now.
1. They will never create a currency that's as private as bitcoin and with as low as an inflation rate and,
2. Governments are slow with implementing technology. If governments are ever going to create a cryptocurrency it will take at least 20 more years. But point 1 is still in effect. The coin will probably suck compared to bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-03 13:46:08
When you're sending bitcoins, you're making a request to the miners to lower the balance on an address you control and to transfer the balance (minus mining fee) to an address of your choice, and return the change to one of your addresses.
All you need is a bitcoin address of someone in Ethiopia and you can send it using one of the many bitcoin wallets.
The real challange I think is to find an exchange in Ethiopia. It might be a good idea to start one.

I like this development a lot. It makes bitcoin much more useful. You can compose your own store of value. I can see there is going to be a hunt for these practises though, from governments. They will tell us it's for our own protection, but how can we be confident to store our value there?

In my country, the Netherlands, it's one of the first things you learn in high school economics. They'll tell you economic cycles are inevitabel and the governments should step in to smooth out the booms and busts.
Only later I learned that the central banking system is the primary cause for these major booms and busts, because it makes it possible for banks to expand the monetary supply in tandem. This creates an artificial boom which creates an inevitabel bust. And only later I learned the boom is the actual problem and the busts are the withdrawal symptoms of a sick economy going back to normal.
Keynes fails to acknowledge in the first place where these booms and busts are coming from and the government stepping in and becoming this big parasitic entity only makes things worse.
That's why Keynes is an ideology. It's a way to force people in some kind of system and to force them to behave in some kind of way.

@_date: 2015-07-21 08:52:54
True, but that's not the point at the moment.
Sepa can be used safely to receive money. As long as you're not banking in Greece at the moment.
I live in the Netherlands and a SEPA transaction is practically unreversible. Theoretically it might be, but you can use a SEPA safely.
European banks will sometimes block a transaction to protect against theft, but if it goes through it's unrealistic to worry about the transaction being cancelled.

@_date: 2015-07-21 09:42:43
Thanks for pointing out that there is a whole system in place where the bank is involved and the sender can't just reverse the transaction. On the contrary are Sepa Direct Debit transactions, which is a pull transaction, not a push transaction, and can easily be reversed by the payer.
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:40:04
Isn't this only true when you assume that 100% of the people will use this system? Which to me is very unlikely, because when people realise the result is a centralization of mining, they will just send their transaction to all the miners.
To me, it seems like just a possibility for the end user to affect the miners.

A big part of my posessions are in Bitcoin. Bitcoin brings me the following things:
1. There are plenty of investment opportunities in the BTC ecosystem. I receive interest in Bitcoin.
2. I'm deversified from the financial system that is still in crisis and very risky.
3. I believe in economic freedom that bitcoin brings and I support something I stand for.
4. Nobody can touch my BTC that are in cold storage. I can travel to anywhere in the world and can use these digital assets.
5. The userbase of the network is still growing and I'll profit from this.
6. It's an exciting new technology. I feel like I'm a pioneer and I can possibly tell my (grand)children I was there fairly from the beginning.
Yes, bitcoin is volatile but I've got an amount invested that I'm comfortable with. Volatility and opportunity go hand in hand. Without volatility bitcoin wouldn't have any chance of growing.
