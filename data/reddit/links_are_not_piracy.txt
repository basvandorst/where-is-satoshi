Thanks, I get that that statement is *statistically* true for addresses in general, but I was wondering if there was a proof that for *any* given address, there exists *at least one private key*.
Or more specifically, is it possible to prove that a given address has *zero private keys*.

Ah yeah, I was just wondering if for some addresses it is mathematically proven impossible to have a private key, or if all addresses theoretically *could* have one (or many).

So, a lose-lose situation... better just archive it somewhere rather than delete it.

manipulates the supply and the demand.
So... 'yes'.

If you voluntarily pay $100 for it, it's $100 worth of BTC.

I think I can guess why they keep toppling.

Money laundering (aka financial privacy), payments for drugs (aka free trade), tax evasion (aka theft prevention)... are you?

Atlas was always good entertainment. I wonder what he's up to these days.

You could easily delete the private key / wallet related to the address but that won't stop anyone from sending money to the address - it would just mean you could never spend it.

I do own 1 btc or more... but it's a bit rough to call it 'luck'.

Thanks! I'm not really a fan of "technically incorrect" either, even if he does expand on his reasoning for being so.

Does anyone know where I can read the proof of how this works?
(Or is it just *assumed* to have no private key because it's so astronomically unlikely?)

Crimes, huh?
Looks like a list of things that shouldn't be illegal in the first place.

An entity known as [sirius]( could be same entity as satoshi, or... it might not be.

We used to use film and ink to make physical photos... then we started storing and transferring them all digitally instead... how come no-one's calling them virtual photos?
Digital currencies aren't virtual currency, they're real actual currency.

It's possible that Karpeles' cat Tibane invented bitcoin using the 'Satoshi' alias, but fairly improbable.
