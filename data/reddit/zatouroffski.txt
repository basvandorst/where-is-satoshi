Keys to control your funds is stored on your phone. Breadwallet connects to a server that runs a node, or directly to a node. This is why it's not downloading whole 145GB blockchain.

Limited supply is to prevent inflation. Other than that, scientists have power to create gold but it costs more than mining an actual one. Imagine that the money you are holding is not backed up. (it's already not but nobody cares)


Yes, all other profits above except fiat value still counts. No supply cap?
 Inflation. Current bitcoin is better than your imagination bitether. Do you know what 1 dollar was standing for or backed up by what? Read upper and lower part. In today's value, it's backed up by an illusion.

Long story short, if you own bitcoins (or other P2P blockchain crypto tokens) on a key that "only" you know, nobody can stole it from you. NOBODY. Whole bitcoin network / blockchain archive must be hacked / bruteforced to hell to make you lose funds. This is why personal wallet is really necessary. But your coins on exchanges, it's not yours. It's their coin that you've lent.


If you are using a key that is exposed, seen by a malware or hackers or a thief in your house that saw it, they can easily steal your funds. That's why people use hardware wallets to solve "malware" risk. Again thieves can find your seeds written on a paper. That's your problem actually. A thief can access to your bank too with the same way etc. You got the point.

You don't have to have programming skills to use a rpi. Well, if you don't want to buy a device just download ubuntu and burn it to cd/usb. Unplug your main hard drive. Boot with usb/CD, (turn off your modem / disconnect from net) run that website that you've downloaded, do what you want to do and then restart your pc. Done.

Pool softwares are opensource and you can host one too, but you need people to join to be a "pool". For Monero, I've used Minexmr. For sumo, intense, electroneum, Monero, you can find lots of pools that has lots of or few people. Connected miners with "found blocks per hour" must be balanced. Low block finding rate with high number of miners will make you earn less. Optimal people / block rate will make you earn more with PPLNS payment system. This is called effectivity. Some words might sound you strange but you need to learn how to connect to pools, how to use mining softwares, how much is the effectivity of the pool you are going to use. The things I've said is about mining with cpu. Cryptonite algorithm. To mine eth, ltc, BTC etc, pool details are similar but it's easy to find popular BTC/LTC/ETH pools.
If you don't want to get busy with this technical details, use nicehash. But doing it with the "normal" way will maximise your profit.

Bitcoin Core is tied to a consensus. They want segwit and don't want more than 1mb blocksize. But Bitmain/Roger Ver doesn't want segwit and 1mb capped blocks so they forked Bitcoin at 1 August before segwit activation and made it to have 8mb capped blocks. BCash is Bitcoin with 8mb blocks without segwit. Hard forking opens a clear page since you can't change/upgrades all the nodes in the network at the same time.
And sometimes, some updates need to made thru hard fork. If everybody wants to change bitcoin hard written consensus (for example 1mb blocks) they must hard fork it too. If everyone is ok with it, people stop mining the old chain and they'll continue with the new one like nothing happened. People wants "bitcoin", not other shitcoins so they didn't abandon it to mine bcash.

Before you start trading, learn LBC scamming technics. The best one is "start a buy order and wait 60-90 minutes to see if BTC price goes up, if it goes down, don't buy and start trading with someone else. If it goes up, buy the BTC with a cheap price". This kind of dudes really makes me mad. Another tip, NEVER EVER AND EVER accept payment from a customer if the bank acc name is not same with his LBC acc name. A popular scamming method is making someone else pay money to you and you are giving btc to the thief.

You should learn how blockchain, software security and types of bitcoin stealing methods works actually.
You'll create a private key, print it to paper and you'll send funds into that address. When she wants to spend it, she'll enter the private key on that paper to her wallet and import it. That's all, like a piggy bank balance goes to your bank.
Point is, you might create a wallet on a computer with malware and funds might get stolen. This will be bad. Private key = Funds. Private key is exposed = Funds are exposed.

3- Their miner is crap.
4- You'll earn more even if you use Nicehash and buy altcoins with that profit. But mining directly altcoins in a public pool will make higher gains.
5- They are thieves. Minergate steals your profit, Freewallet steals your funds, Changelly rate mills your balance. You can find lots of issues with a simple Google search "freewallet scam" etc.
Noob like you can figure that website really easily because you guys are the ones that make them earn money. :D Sorry but if something is too user friendly, it might have some catch. You need to learn some technical details.
Don't believe me? Try yourself. Mine with it's app on Minergate and mine the same coin in another pool with good-configured XMR-Stak app. If you are going to try Monero, I'd suggest minexmr.com (don't even use freewallet and changelly)

I wouldn't trust VM. Just buy a raspberry pi 3b and a cheap flash card to dump. Generate keys in that and destroy the card after use. Or always keep that pi for offline key generation.


Check the youtube links. You are the randomness in key generation by that way. Flipping a coin 256 times is secure enough to hide your coins within this world. Maybe aliens can bruteforce it, don't know but not human technology by now.
FYI, there are millions of people already bruteforcing bitcoin addresses and never saw a one that accomplished it. You can simply generate Satoshi Nakamoto's wallets' private key, mathematically possible. Practically, impossible.

For key generation if you don't trust your CPU; (since you are doing this on an offline machine, injected software will not matter, if you think it's really injected and creates keys within a single seed mechanic that only the developer knows, verify the generated key with other generator app. If it's same, it's working.)

Other than that sattelite / VPN comments, you can try this by yourself too. Setup an intranet and clone BTC (fork it to yourself) and mine it, do some transactions. It will get orphaned if you try to merge it with the rest of the world but it will still work within that intranet network. It will act like a new coin.
If a country isolates themselves, if you are in the rest of the world and doesn't give a lol of them, you don't have to do anything. If you want to use that coin in that country while you are outside, give your private key to a person there, cash out, and take your money to the main chain (like bcash). But remember, it will have a replay risk since there is no protection if core developers doesn't update the main chain.

Every transaction will create another input. This means higher fees with every input. Don't remember if coinbase uses fixed withdraw fee like exchanges. But if it is, continue using coinbase or an exchange (that has minimum deposit balance that supports your gain)
Or open a second account (you can do it on same seed) in Ledger BTC section and sum them up to your main account's address with low fees when you are not in a hurry.

@_date: 2019-07-30 09:47:32
Imagine you own an address that has 1 BTC and named X. When you spend coins from X, 0.5 BTC for example, you sign with your private key.
1 input from address X=1 BTC goes to 2 outputs.
--Address Y, 0.5 BTC.
--Address Z, 0.5 BTC minus transfer fees.
Y is the guy you are sending. But Z is your brand new change address that now holds the remaining balance. X is now empty. But you still hold it's private key. If someone sends some balance to X, you can still spend it. But now it will have some privacy concerns because you will sign a transaction again from X. This is why after every transaction, your wallet generates an empty address that tied to your seed. That wiki page explains it. Re-signing transactions from same address is not deadly, but don't do it if you don't have to. Use newly generated ones from your seed. Btw it's ok to accumulate bitcoins into one address as long as you don't sign any transactions from that. But more than 1 transaction input will generate a higher transaction data = higher transaction fees. This is why one transfer of 1 BTC on 1 address is better than 0.1 btc on 10 addresses for cheaper fees. But for privacy? I prefer 10 0.1 BTC based on different keys for security.
If you send 0.1 BTC ten times to an address, that address's 1 BTC transaction will include 10 inputs. Mind that. Every single transaction on history = +1 input while transferring it.

It's easy to implement. But there's a API call restriction within blockchain services. For example, blockcypher service gives 2000 Requests Per Day for a free token. If people using your app gets higher than 2000 within a day, they will not see that feature anymore. But you are always free to use your own blockchain explorer server. But you know, checking manually is easier than setting up a server for that.

400$ in fees is indeed too much because it has 51 inputs. Also 177 sat/b. Doesn't matter if you move 5.000.000 BTC or 0.1 BTC. You'll have to pay that 0.04 BTC as fees.

Bitcoin network uses sat/b fee system for transfers. 1 block holds approximately 1mb of transfer data (before segwit). You can do nothing to lower the sat/b value without changing a code/upgrading the core. When everybody pays 10 sat/b, someone there will pay 20 sat/b to get a faster confirmation time. If bitcoin price doubles, you'll still pay the same satoshi amount but fiat value of it will double.
What Kraken can do is, collecting 0.0003 btc per person, but waits 5-10 people to transfer the funds. This will make your "waiting transfer to start" rise, but cheaper.

You don't have to wait or use the device. Just send coins to your receiving address. Bitcoin moves on blockchain. Not on physical hard drives. If transfer has more than 1 confirmation, it's safely stored in that address.

Bitcoin core uses wallet file to store private keys. Electrum also creates a wallet too but you can write down your seed to a paper and delete wallet file. You can restore it. But, every time you write down your seed to a keyboard, it's getting exposed to hackers. It's really stupid to write your private keys to a notepad file and store it on your desktop or cloud drive.

Your coins stays in same position until it gets a confirmation. Bitcoin cannot get lost. It goes to your transferred address or stays in same address.
For safety issues, software doesn't show your balance. It's not lost, it's still there but blocked because it's reserved for transaction. There are software wallets that can enable doublespending, which allows you to see your whole balance even if you've started a transfer with that.
You can sign a transaction paper with the same private key on an offline machine with your ledger seed and broadcast that on an online machine but you need to learn how to do it first. Since you don't know what is double spending, don't try this and wait your order to get dropped from mempool. :P

The thing you want is nonsense. To trade paper wallet, someone has to make an effort (transportation) and you want it for free. Coinbase is not a wallet. It's a cooperation like a bank. Exchanges are not wallets. You don't own their private key.

You can try sweeping them one by one by QR code to a mobile Bitcoin wallet. Mycelium on Android and Breadwallet on iOS. Doing this on Breadwallet will empty that key's balance to your wallet addresses tied to your seed. I prefer controlling it via Mycelium Android or Electrum but you've said it has a problem. Are you sure the keys you pulled from wallet is a working standart private key? Can you try generating an empty Bitcoin private key from bitaddress website and restore Electrum with that key?

Delete mycelium again and reinstall it again with your old seed. Send all of your funds to that public address of the new seed.
Install Electron Cash on PC. Restore your wallet with your old seed. You'll see your BCH balance. Good thing is, your bitcoins are not on this seed anymore so you are safe. Send your BCH to an exchange if you wish that.

Coins are not moving anywhere. Dropping from mempool means transaction getting cancelled and you balance unlocks.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:11:32
Plus, if you are using a single private key for transfer in Mycelium for example, 1ab input goes to 1cd and the remaining balance gets sent to 1ab again. To withdraw my funds, I must sign 1ab's paper again. Not good. That's why sweeping is better. It empties private key's whole balance to your wallet that tied to a seed.

To export a key, you must firt unlock your wallet if it's locked. Enter this to debug screen.
walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600
Your walletphrase section is your password. Enter it inside the commas.
Next step, in bitcoin core client, if you enter "listreceivedbyaddress" code (without commas) it should show you received addresses. Since my core has none, I can't see what it shows. But I have a demo screenshot about how you get a private key of a public address.

ELI5: I'm thinking about a number in between 0-100. Lucky guesser will get the block reward. 1 person will need approximately 100 seconds to guess it. What if 10 people starts to guess it? Approximately in 10 seconds a group of people will find it. To fix it, I'm starting to think a number in between 0-1.000. Now, there are 65.000.000 people guessing that number. To make them find it in 100 seconds, I need to guess a number in between 0-6.500.000.000. This is how it's difficulty works. More people joining in - more complicated it gets. More people dropping out - less complicated it gets. Because Bitcoin block must be found in approximately 10 minutes.
1 Hash = 1 Guess about the next block's hash.

First, coinbase is not a personal wallet. The account you are opening there acts like an exchange wallet. Private keys are not yours.


They have bitcoins in hot wallets for daily operations. If you are going to withdraw a large amount, like 1,000 BTC, they can still sign a transaction on their offline machine and publish it on an online machine to keep their private key airgapped. Withdraw the large amount to outside, distribute to owners, put remaining coins back to cold storage.

Only danger will be, if anyone monitoring that address, will know that you did a withdraw and the address they are going is yours. Because of this, don't sweep it into an address that has 50.000 dollars :D (address that has history, not a 0 balanced single address)

Do you trust the already installed software? Do you trust your cpu’s randomness generator? What will happen if a regular dude buys a phone and it comes with a wallet that already has set-up seeds, gets robbed in a day after he balances it up? Reputation injury out of nowhere. At least ledger software asks you 5 times that did you buy the device from the retailer, did it come with no seed etc. in install section. Gives a clue. If you believe that ledger gives seeds from a list that company already has, you can generate your own seed with paper and pen and restore it on the device, like you can also do with Electrum/Mycelium seeds.

My opinion: Bch will not solve anything either because those cancerous guys and miners can still bottleneck 8mb blocks with dust transactions. When they achieve that, they will get 8 times more on fees. I'd rather stick with btc.
One thing is for sure. Roger Vermin is scamming people while shilling his bcrash as bitcoin on his websites and people lose time and money.

I think it's not fees but a premium price because sellers are also person. Also in Turkey if exchange price is $7000, LBC sellers sets price at $7100 for example. But you don't have any other solution I guess. You can find someone to buy/sell gift cards. I was selling Turkish prepaid iTunes cards to a dude from telegram with %3-5-8 premium. You can sell $100 worth iTunes card for $95 worth BTC. This will make your purchase cheaper than LBC.
I also use Kraken but they only accept swift transfers from Euro Zone countries. You can find an exchange that accepts swift from there. Bitfinex maybe. But don't forget the swift fees.

Your argument is like "It is impossible to die from falling. Just don't jump from a high surface".  If it cannot be double spent, why do you wait for 6. Because, it can be.
The thing you say is %51 / validating orphan blocks. So much hashrate distribution and difficulty makes it nearly impossible and pointless to mine orphan blocks for a doublespend action. So much loss of electricity = money.

First, move your BTC to a safe place. To another seed or key. Then, you need to use your private key on the forked coin's application. There is Electron Cash for BCash for example. Google replay protection. Never use your valuable private key on a sh*tcoin, they might steal your bitcoin balance.

TLDR: False.
It's Garanti Investment / Securities cooperation. Not Garanti Bank, they are different things. This is for saving the users from footloose pricing. Because "Istanbul Securities Exchange" was closed on weekends, every bank and exchange office had different values of foreign currency rate. Some had $1 - 7.5 Lira, some had $1-5.5 Lira. Buy price was 6.5 lira, sell price was 7.5 lira. Which was a huge gap. That's all. Now the price is stable @ 6.94 Lira for $1 and you are free to buy&amp;sell (for now).

Just forget what you've seen. Start from starch. Bitcoin's software is Bitcoin Core. This is also a wallet. There are another light wallets that connects thru core network clients like Mycelium.
Exchanges are websites that has their own wallets. You send BTC to their wallet and they credit your user account. Including Coinbase. Looks like a personal wallet but you don't have your keys.
Not your keys - not your bitcoin. 
You can google what is private key or seed. If you have your BTC in a private key / seed that you own, nobody can take it from you, unless they know the key / seed. This means, governments can't control it. But an exchange can say bye-bye, and you say bye-bye too to your coins.

If I start a transaction to you with 1 sat/b, you'll have to wait more than 3-5 hours. You can see the transfer order in an explorer, the coin will get transferred to you. After some time, I can create a new transfer order with same coins, higher sat/b value, to a different address. 400 sat/b for example. 10-15 minutes later, your wallet's "incoming transfer" notification will get disappeared. Guess why, because it's a doublespent transaction.
You can see addresses that has a doublespent transaction history in blockchain.info explorer.
Your "wait until the 6th confirmation" argument is pointless. You are waiting a confirmation to eliminate the risk of double spending. I don't know if you've read the whitepaper. Bitcoin itself has no possible way to get same coins spent more than one time (getting cloned) since you can see it in public ledger. But both "moving coins that waiting a transaction confirmation to somewhere else with another transaction order" and "mining another block to get a validation and then getting orphaned" is called double spending. Nobody has power to mine 5-6 streak of blocks to activate fake transactions in Bitcoin network. Just a really huge luck. Thus I'm saying that, people can activate a doublespending with more than 2 transaction orders with a fee gap. Blocks numbered 535739-535740-535741 are mined by the same company, they had an opportunity to mess with the ledger, and also a chance to lose millions of dollars. This is why you wait 6.
There is no point in discussing this with you. Doublespending exists, to eliminate it with a guarantee, you are waiting 6 blocks to get a verification.

According to what you are mining. L3+ only mines Scrpyt coins. If device burns 400 pound per month, check what coin you can mine to get maximum profit.
Just an example; If you mine doge, you'll earn 1000 pounds worth BTC. If you mine LTC, you'll earn 600 pounds worth BTC. So, buy it and mine Doge, not LTC. Hold it or exchange it to BTC or fiat directly. People that using GPUs stopped mining Ethereum (because difficulty went higher than it's price rate) and started mining Electroneum, same algo with Monero, getting mined by CPUs. GPUs are not meant for CPU mining coins but hey, you are getting your profit, so what's wrong about it. You have the device, you must search the most profitable coin. Nobody said mining is easy.
A tip for beginners; if your ROI date is longer than 3 months, it always have a risk. First ASICs from an algo always has a ROI of 2-4 weeks. This might seduce you. Probably only friends of Bitmain can obtain it. But when you get 2nd, 3rd party product, that ROI will sky rocket to 4-6-8 months. Never jump to a pool that has no visible bottom.

Current state of LN is not %100 necessary for a normal person, like you. But imagine exchanges, big companies or other LN users move their BTC around LN, then you'll have a free space to make on-chain transactions. Problem solved. Plus, software engineers are still developing this for mainstream usage with lightweight clients. Still don't like it? Don't use it. LN is just a layer solution, like Omni. Tether works on omni layer, on Bitcoin Blockchain. Do you feel an urge to use omni layer? No.

If government goes crazy and nukes AMD/Intel/Bitmain/Asus/MSI etc. etc., you'll still have opportunity to mine Bitcoin with ARM processors. Raspberry Pi / Mobile phones etc. Bitcoin software scales difficulty to mine one block per 5/10 minutes, Litecoin's block exploration rate is 2 times faster. Can't remember the details now.
So, if bitmain pushes a button and all antminers stop working, miners with GPU rig can turn back to SHA256 mining.

Just don't support that hardfork (new coin) that has increased supply. You are still free to mine/use the current one. A team increased block size to 8mb (bcash) and we are still using the old one, Bitcoin. (segwit is a soft fork update). Increasing blocksize or max supply must be a hard fork from this software.


ELI5: It's like creating/uploading a torrent file in 5 minutes. 1 year later, you'll have no power to delete those files, unless you block it globally with your ISP or raid the computers that has that file. Practically, impossible.
There are no spine servers to take it down, Bitcoin is a peer to peer software. Even if some dude modifies his blockchain history files to mess people's balances, other core owners will block / ignore him. To mess with it, google %51 attack, majority attack. But it's not simple.

Yes. A proper light wallet (not coinbase) and core will give you your private keys or seed. Coinbase doesn't give out user's seeds.
If you are using android, download mycelium. iOS, BREAD. At start, it will make you write down 12 word seeds. Write them to a paper. That's your key. Now you own your coins. (never write them to a digital platform or they'll likely get stolen) If your phone gets destroyed, reinstall the app and restore it with your seed, you'll get your balance back. Don't know BREAD's seed standard but for example Mycelium's seed works with Electrum on PC. You might need to convert BREAD's seed for Electrum. But at the end of the day, you'll get your balance back.
Other than that, google Ledger Nano S, Trezor etc. Hardware wallets are safer than PC/Mobile software wallets and capable to store more than one coin. Nano S has ability to store Monero keys too. Altcoins, lot's of em'

Because bcash is his coin. Tricking people to buy bcash by calling it the real bitcoin because he owns the popular websites like bitcoin.com. Causing people lose money by buying the wrong coin or getting scammed by searching bcash wallets and falling into hands of phishing and imitation. Not supporting segwit because of Asicboost. Clogging bitcoin network, raising fees to 500 sat/b and telling people that bigger blocks is the only way. Forking bitcoin immediately before the segwit activation. Pointlessly raising blocksize to 8mb and opening a way of a centralized coin. Making people buy their sh*tcoin by pumping it himself but gets in a inevitable loss. That's how you turn into a clown from a saint. I'm not calling BCH is a scam, I call it bullsh*t like USD is bullsh*t too.
If you trust yourself, you can imply a thing to Bitcoin, offer it to network, if majorty wants it, it will get accepted. That's how segwit is implemented. Open voting. Or you can directly fork Bitcoin and make blocksize cap 2TB , premine 50.000, make average block finding time to 5 seconds and remove the total coin cap and call it Bitcoin Credit Card. If you have a friend like Jihan Wu, you'll have no problem. Except the code itself :P Good luck with orphaned blocks.

As we know, China is number 1 in this SHA ASIC clusters. So you are working for China. Or USA &amp; China is in this job together for taking down Russia. :P Problem is, SHA hashing is a defence method for USA too.

You are not "magically" giving computing power to a closed box software. The mining apps that nicehash is using are opensourced miner applications that does a specific thing. You can even use that miner software yourself and link it's address to nicehash to you'll again earn bitcoins again, just without their benchmark software.

Does your exchange has a warning about low sat/b rates? I guess no because you still think Bitcoin is slow. E-mail your exchange to f- themselves. I believe you paid more than 15 sat/b but still they've sent it with 4 sat/b. Stop using them.

Seed generates private keys. Ledger device protects the seed and makes it able to use. As soon as you enter your seed to a software to redeem your funds (for example Electrum for BTC), there will be no point to use Ledger because you are exposing your seed. Nice to redeem your funds but never do it if your Ledger is working.
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:06:01
Yes. 1 confirmation means it's written in the last found block. When network finds the next block, your transaction will be in it's 2nd confirmation. Means it's 2-block-mature. If you inspect a transaction from last years, you'll see 53464 confirmation etc.
Average block generation (finding) time is 10 minutes in BTC. Can be 20 or 5, but 10 is average. It's 2.5 minutes in LTC, etc. This is how difficulty adjusts itself, not a problem of Bitcoin.

(First, I'm not supporting Bitcoin for a national currency right now) I'm talking about it's value on uniqueness scale. USD is just a worthless paper since it's not referring anything at the end of the day and "they" are still printing it. Why it has value? Because it's an easy toy for governments to play.
Bitcoin is limited by 21.000.000 total supply. It has a distributed ledger around the world that cannot be modified. Unlike USD, no one can create it from thin-air. It's much more valuable than gold, since it's possible to create gold in a laboratory. It's not cost-effective, but they can. If gold price goes higher, it will be reasonable to create it. Doesn't matter if bitcoin price goes $10 or $10.000.000, you cannot get it without a proof of work. You cannot create it after 21.000.000 total supply.

Nicehash makes you mine a coin that is profitable with your hardware and they pay you with bitcoins. I prefer mining a coin myself with an optimized software for higher gains.


Nicehash app opens the miner software that everybody is using. (the app with the dos command screen that shows your hashrate, solution accepted infos etc.) Nicehash itself is just a fool proof system.

Got it. Last question. A friend made a Poloniex bot on a website, year ago. You can register as a user, enter your polo API key and let bot work within the selected parameters of yours. If X coin goes %X higher in X minutes, sell. If X coin goes %X lower in X minutes, buy. Balance stays in tether. Purpose was raising your USD amount. While prices were raising up like a rocket, it didn't buy or sold with a low profit, because it wasn't going down. After that $20K peak, price started to fell and bot continued to buy&amp;buy&amp;buy&amp;buy. People got stabbed @ 19K-17K USD BTC prices. A big unpredictable loss.
So; your bot is waiting a dip point to buy and a predicted peak point to sell. Point is raising your BTC amount. Does it has a fail switch? If BTC price never goes below $7080 or never reaches "0.0077 BTC @ $6519.44" buyback point, does it going to reconfigure itself?

To find 1 block per 10 minutes (average).
Smaller cap - miners that has high hasrate can hop on and off to rapidly find blocks just for the prize.
Larger cap - if a group of miners with really high hashrate drops out, remaining miners will really have a bad time to find blocks with huge difficulty.

Yes. This is why someone should wait 2-3+ confirmed blocks to accept the payment. This goes to every decentralized currency. Wait longer for unpopular coins. 50-60 blocks for example. (Some pools that offers cryptonite mining waits 30-40-50 blocks to verify that it's valid and pays his users)

A laptop that connects to internet might not safe to operate &amp; store a wallet. If you sure it is safe or you are going to use it for cold storage, you can use Electrum wallet.
Bitcoin is not moving anywhere. They are on blockchain, wallet applications just changes the owner of it. While you are using a wallet program, it holds your private keys that controls your bitcoins in the blockchain. If you are not sure your PC is clean, create a wallet (with 12 word seed) on your clean phone (Mycelium, Breadwallet etc.). Never expose that 12 word seed to internet / digital. Write it on paper. Now, send your bitcoins from bitcoin.de to your wallet's address. As long as you have that 12 word seed, you are it's owner. If your friend sees that 12 word seed, he can restore it to steal your funds.
12 word seed = owner of that bitcoins.
If your phone is lost, a meteor hit your house and your PC melt, you can use that 12 word seed on another wallet application to take control of your bitcoins again. If you think someone is going to open your phone, create a new wallet, write down it's deposit address, restore your old 12 word seed, send all bitcoins to your new address that generated by new seed. That's all.

Coinbase is an exchance website. They are called hot wallets. Hot wallet is not truly yours, if Coinbase closes or refuses to pay you, say goodbye to your money. You can use free software wallets to hold your money. Trezor is a hardware wallet that protects your bitcoin data against hackers. You can use it on a infected computer that has trojans, viruses, etc. Transaction command is signed by the device, it cannot be manupilated. If your wallet application on pc gets infected, say goodbye to your bitoins. That's why it's better to use clean ios / android if you don't know how to protect your PC / using tails / using cold storage etc. Hardware wallet is the best choice. If you are going to hold your bitcoins without spending it, you can use free paper wallet system.

Wallet always stores BTC private keys. Coinbase has an account for you to hold your fiat. Coinbase's wallet is not your personal wallet btw. They are just holding it for you. Never trust anyone.

"Recommended fee" is not the answer. Sat/byte number is the answer. Some wallets with high priority fee setting might push your transaction with 50 sat/byte, which will be confirmed in 12 hours.
Right now 140 sat/byte transfer will be confirmed in 5 minutes or less. This is the recommended fee and blockchain online wallet sets it true.
@_date: 2017-02-09 11:52:23

Go to wallet settings and take your seed (backup). A 12 word phrase. Write it down and never let anyone see it / or lose it. If someone sees your seed, it's theirs. Because of this, it's stupid to save it on you computer. Never let it touch a digital device.

And if you are going to divide your bitcoins while sending them out (sending quarter of your total amount), your transactions from these addresses will take more inputs and outputs. This is why people paying 3 dollar fee when sending 5 dollars. That 5 dollars lies in more than 4 inputs = helluva expensive.

- Electricity prices are much lower in China.
- Owning large facilities is easier in China. (also you can make wind tunnels instead of air condition.)
- Bitmain etc. is in China. (no import-export fees, fast delivery &amp; easy to repair devices)
Bitcoin mining is unprofitable if you are not an owner of a dam, wind farm, solar farm. Instead of investing 2000$ to a device and wait 1 year to get ROI, just buy 2000$ worth bitcoins.

It can be tracked. Bitcoin is not private, it's just anonymous. Once they have the starting point and the addresses tied to an exchange + your IP, they'll have a clue.
(Hey Binance, if this address sends bitcoin to your deposit addresses, inform us with his IP.) Seems exaggerated, but they can do it if they want. Just go to a sh*tty internet cafe and use a disposable fresh account, buy monero and withdraw.

Pin code to open the application that's all. Seed is hidden away from access. When you want to see your receiving address, or send btc to another address, use your pin to open the app.
When you install the app, first thing is to get your seed and write it on a paper. Accounts tab, press your listed account and press "create backup". This will show you your seed. You will not need to see it again. Everytime you see it, it gets vulnerable to malware etc.
If you are using warez/root on your phone, it's not safe to run a wallet on that.

Yes. It's a simple 12 word  phrase (or more on other BIP standarts) called seed. Restoring it on another wallet will retrieve back anything you have. The thing is, exposing your seed to hackers will make you lose it all. That's why I don't let my savings stay on an online wallet which showed my seed words on an internet browser. Never write your seed on a digital device unless you need to. If you lose your phone, or having a doubt about your seed protection, create a new seed and move back all of your bitcoins which were tied to your old seed. Just to be safe.

No. It's about the transaction byte size. Size: 873 (bytes) Fee: 0.00081538
81538(satoshi)/873(byte) = 93.3997709 Sat/byte fee.
For a normal transaction time (validation in 1-2 blocks) ; it should be 170-200 sat/byte. This means, you (or he) needs to pay more satoshi next time.

After the trade, I can refresh my bitcoin fund status and again send that 1 bitcoin before the 1st one's transfer is validated. Again I am sending 1 bitcoin with 300 sat/byte fee to someone else.
In 5 minutes, my 1 bitcoin that have sent to another dude gets validated before your transaction. My transaction job to you gets cancelled. This is called double spending. And by this way I've scammed you for 1200$ amazon gift card. This is way you should wait for 3 confirmations for trading something.

Theorically, uses same address system. If you enter private key of the BCH address / wallet to a BTC wallet, you can get access to your bitcoins. Same thing  works reverse too. But just don’t forget something, if you send bch to a bitcoin address that doesn’t start with 1, it can’t be reversed and lost. BCH ecosystem doesn’t accept transactions from segwit addresses anymore. I believe you must mine it yourself, which is impossible to solo.
@_date: 2019-03-11 15:54:41
You can spend your balance again if it's unconfirmed. (app locks your balance but you can still unlock it to spend) Current sat/b of your 1st transaction is 2, which is quite low. Set a new transaction with unconfirmed balance and set sat/b to 80s. Your transaction will get confirmed within 1st block and you'll save your funds.

Traceable. But you need to know which address belongs to whom. Otherwise it's totally anonymous.
If somebody knows that you've got 150 bitcoins from an address, you can send that 150 bitcoins to a cleaner, cleaner will send you 150 bitcoins from a different root of addresses to your different address. By this way, your bitcoin traces will be forked like you are someone else. Switching personalities. No one can find your new address while tracing your old 150 bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:59:12
Don't know how government will trace your bitcoins. The point is, they are not traceable. (who sends to whom?). I'm not from US and I laugh a lot when people says "how can I tax my bitcoin earnings". Do you give tax when you are buying gold nuggets or trading gold for cash?
In LBC you are just finding a person's phone number or mail address and tell him that you wan to do a trade. $5 or $500.000, doesn't matter. For example there is a person in Bulgaria that comes to Turkey when you want to sell or buy a huge bale of cash for bitcoins. Zero tax.

Create a wallet. Generate an address. Send 1 bitcoin to that address. Now, that wallet holds 1 bitcoin within 1 key.
If you use that wallet to send 1 bitcoin to another dude. Your transaction will be 1 input and 1 output.
If you use that wallet to send 0.5 bitcoin to another dude, Your transaction will be 1 input and 2 output (0.5 to dude, 0.5 to yourself)
Create a wallet. Generate an address. Send 1 bitcoin to that address. Send 1 bitcoin again to another generated address. Now, that wallet holds 2 bitcoin within 2 keys.
If you use that wallet to send 2 bitcoin to another dude. Your transaction will be 2 input and 1 output.

China exchange regulations? The very last fiat withdraw regulation made the price crash by $30, which is nothing, because volume is moving to Japan, escaping from China's monopoly. At this time, any "X bans BITCOIN" news will not make a huge crash. But ETF is the key. Graph is very volatile now. High risk = high gain (again, my thoughts)
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:25:20
No, People's Bank of China made a secret meeting for exchanges and then prices crashed by $300. After 1 week, they have announced that withdrawing fiat will be blocked for 3 months for inspection (as I remember), then prices dropped by $30, which is good, 30 is nothing. After that, volume started to move out of China to Japan and got stabilised. Since tuesday, bitcoin started to go up at rocket speed, which is the reason of ETF, not exchanges. This is very volatile now.

4 hours is a short time for 60 sat/byte. 150sat/byte gets confirmed in 30min-2hours. You have a chance to wait more than 24-36 hours. (can't open 21.co fee graph right now, just prediction)
Long story short, you will not lose your coins. They will get confirmed or will be back to your wallet if it waits more than 4-5 days without validation (if you are not using a PC wallet).

Since it didn't happen in history, nobody %100 knows what will happen. But we know nothing will happen when you magically achieve %51 majority, there will be a code based war. As I believe, even if %51 modifies the chain, other %49 can fork out and continue supporting the bitcoin. But during this time, someone might lose their money, something like more than 5 chain worth transactions, including modified fake amounts.
Imagine a pool, has ability to mine 7 blocks in a row. Lots of exchanges accept 6 confirmation. If they fake out transactions and mine 6 more blocks on it, theorically they can wipe out exchanges. This is why when BCH was freshly forked, exchanges required more than 100 confirmations to credit your account.
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:50:04
Yes, you have paid a miner to mine your transaction. After it gets 1 confirmation, it will spread on other ledgers.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:19:24
Yes. Transaction order will get removed from the queue because of low fees. Unless their wallet continues to broadcast. But again it will not get accepted too because still it's fee is still low.

Until the trade is cancelled, or 90 minutes have passed, bitcoins from escrow will get released back to it's owner.
If other side presses "I've paid" button within 90 minutes, coins will get locked until you release them to the customer.

Check supported coins. Both of them are good. Don't know about Trezor but Ledger's ''ledger live'' app comes with good graphical interface and really useful to check your balance history, status without connecting your device (uses your master public keys to track balance, needs extra password to open the app, this means it's safe even if you get hacked, nobody will get your private keys.).

Full node validates transactions and stores the ledger (needs high capacity drive). Soft wallets just holds private keys and makes transactions with connecting to nodes on the network. Full node is Bitcoin Core software, the ''ultimate software'' itself. Problem is, if your computer gets hacked, hackers can steal your wallet file. Hardware wallets eliminates this issue.
You don't store your funds. Your funds are on the ledger (blockchain ledger, not that Ledger Nano device). You have your keys to get access to your funds on the ledger. Once your device sends the signed transfer order paper to network, miners verify it and you get your funds moved to another address. This is how bitcoin works basically.
By using Ledger Company, you are using Ledger's servers. There's no custom connection to your own private node. There are some mobile wallet softwares that has an option to connect to your full node ip for anonymity etc.

There are some btc miner websites that wants you to pay some satoshis and write down your transaction id to push your transaction forward. But I guess you already know this.
I prefer doing a RBF transaction (which already worked on myself) but again, if you say it's wrong, ok. Normally I follow the method above instead of doing CPFP.

If you have no idea what you are doing, you should begin using Ubuntu. If you are going to use Linux for coin security, buy a Raspberry Pi and use Raspbian (Debian port) on it. This way you can disconnect it from everything easily / hide your sd card.

Well. Basically, to help Bitcoin network &amp; about trusting nobody. You can run a full node with zero balance to contribute to peer to peer network.  If you are going to use your full node with a balance, you really need to take care of your security. Your wallet file just sits in a folder. Keylogger can get your passphrase to unlock that wallet or simply someone can steal your wallet file and bruteforce it to get access to your private keys. You are doing the best thing with using Ledger device. (for a regular user). Experts/professionals uses offline machines to sign transaction papers and publishes it to network themselves etc.
For detailed info, (add wallet file security to cons)

You don't even own your private keys on coinbase wallet. Does it make Coinbase a ''best'' wallet?
@_date: 2019-03-10 21:59:56
When you spend some of your coins in a single address, your wallet will move the remaining funds to a change (new) address. This means address X will be empty. But it doesn't matter. Getting another payment to X will be still safe. If you sign a second transaction from X's private key, it gets vulnerable as I've linked the explanation. I don't know further details, didn't see any news about addresses getting emptied because someone signed more than 2 transactions from it. If you check random addresses from blockchain, you can see there are addresses that has a history of more than 10 transactions. So consider it safe maybe.
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:00:15
If it was "eth", yes. Even if BTC hardforks to BU, you'll still have coins in a main currency + you can sell the other one if it's not going good.
@_date: 2019-03-05 13:57:07
Waiting for more than 1 confirmation is alright and considered non-reversible practically. If transaction gets accepted in 1st block, you'll have to wait approximately 10-20 minutes more for 2-3 confirmations. Current average time per block is 10 minutes. Can be 2, 5, 10, 15 but average is 10 minutes. Every block mined after the first confirmed transaction makes +1 confirmation.
Mostly, bitcoin exchanges waits for 6 confirmations to credit your account. But it's for eliminating organized attacks on an automated system.
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:32:33
If you are "double spending", after 1 transfer validation, the other transfer will be cancelled. Getting flagged with "double spend" status is just a warning for trust issues, person might try to scam you etc. That's all, confirmation time is tied to your sat/byte fee.
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:26:35

You can check here to see what sat/b you should pay to get immediate confirmation in first block.  
True. That's called double spending attack and this is why people wait for at least one confirmation. More than 2 for much higher values. If you accept payments with 0 confirmation, that's about trust. If you are going to sell a can of coke, there's no point to lose your customer to wait their confirmation.

I see people sending bitcoins to other coin addresses daily but at the end of the day, they are all valid to send. For example you can send Litecoins to a Bitcoin segwit address. And still it's reversible, not lost if you own it's private key. Other thing is, there's an astronomically low chance to send bitcoins to a mistyped ''but valid'' address that you don't own it's private key.
I see people sending bitcoins to burning addresses but again, they are burning addresses because they are already valid but nobody has their private key.

No never. Never write those 25 words that Ledger gave to you to another digital device unless you need to rescue your funds in case of lost/broken Ledger. After saving that, destroy that 25 words as it's already exposed.
I see that full node thing scrambled your mind. Don't think about it, Ledger device and Ledger Live software is all you need. For much more anonymity, Ledger supports multiple accounts. So you can save 10 BTC in 1st account and 0.1 BTC in 2nd account. While spending a balance from 2nd account, transfer orders will never include addresses in 1st account. That's really good if you want to hide that you own a private key of a 10BTC holding address. You got the idea.

Since we have hierarchical deterministic wallets, you don't have to worry about new change addresses. All of your created addresses are tied to one seed, the one that you took note while creating it.

When you restore your seed on another wallet, it will act like the same one of yours. Previous one will still continue to work. Spending funds on pi will be like spending funds on your previous computer. But having same data on 2 different computer this is kinda dangerous for your safety and if you are an active trader, you might double spend your funds.

As I know, other than wallet app's checksum, miners/nodes (bitcoin core) will simply ignore this transaction because this is an invalid bitcoin address. You might broadcast a transaction and wallet software you are using can lock your funds but at the end of the day, your bitcoins will stay in your wallet.


Are there any examples about sending bitcoins to an invalid address?
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:59:04
Yes, with 3rd party programs. Instead of trusting them, just install core and dump private keys. You don't need to wait for sync.

For every transaction, your hierarchical deterministic wallet will create a new address for deposit. Unless you are transfering more than 0.5-1 BTC in a single transaction, you don't have to worry about it. Even if you have 300 BTC seperated into 400 addresses, you'll only use the address that has that small balance that you want to withdraw. For example if you want to withdraw 0.03BTC from a 1000 BTC (already seperated into lots of low balanced addresses), you'll only use addresses with small balance. Nobody will know that you have 1000BTC. If you've deposited 15 BTC directly into a single address, don't use that seed for daily use. Send the amount you'll spend in a month to an exchange and withdraw it back to your other wallet that has different seed.
Also Ledger has multiple account options. By this way, you can use your small amount balance account for daily use and bigger for long term storage without getting risk of scrambling your balances.

You own your keys. That 12-25 words that you write at the beginning is the key. But it's software is not a full node, it must connect to a server to verify and validate transactions and to start one. Same goes with Electrum and all other mobile wallets too.

Your seed words can be converted to work with other wallet standarts. You don't need Ledger to rescue your balance. Also, ''signed transfer papers'' getting out from your device is immune to modification (with today's computing power), so nothing will happen if servers get compromised. If whole Ledger company vanishes, you can enter your seed words to Electrum to use your BTC balance for example.
Never enter your seed words to any device unless you want to empty it immediatly. Entering your seed to a second device will eliminate the point of owning hardware wallets. If it gets exposed to a malware, you'll lose your balance. Some people steals keys but waits for a big hit, you can stay safe for 2 years with 0.05 BTC balance but when you transfer 2 BTC into it, in 15 minutes your balance will vanish. There's no chance to know that your seed is exposed or not.

Your transfer holds and merges lots of addresses into bytes. Not a small one. That's why it's expensive first of all. Other than that, higher transfer traffic means higher fee to confirm in a short time. You can check fee-time graph here.

"Waiting confirmation" ?. After some time, getting more than 1-2-3 confirmation, it will be validated.
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:41:53
When you open a trade, seller's BTCs are instantly gets lockdown for 90 minutes (seller can edit this time), when 90 minute passes without any payment going on, BTCs sent back to seller. When you send money within this 90 minutes, you press "I've sent the money" button and 90 minute cap vanishes, you must wait seller to confirm your payment. If he is insisting on not confirming, you can talk with LBC staff with your receipt. If he's trying to scam you, BTCs are locked down will transferred to your account. If you didn't sent any payment but still pressed "I've payed", well, you know what will happen to you.
Look for sellers that has %100 good reputation and more than 100 transfers. If you are going to trade more than 1 bitcoins, you should meet face to face or talk with the seller and get a guarantee.

Again, recover your seeds within a clean device. Never expose it. You'll really surprise how these strange methods are. For example I saw one really messed up thing. When you are going to copy&amp;paste your wallet address that you'll deposit funds to, virus automatically recognises that it's a bitcoin address and changes it to another one. When you paste it to browser/app without checking it, you'll going to send it to the virus owner.
There are also viruses that scans temporary internet files folder for people who printed that 12 word key directly from web browser etc. etc. Long story short, watch out.

For every transaction, you must connect to blockchain ledgers to verify that payment. If I transfer my BTC's to you offline, I have an opportunity to cancel it on my side and transfer to someone else before you go online. That will be seen as double spent. So your wallet must lock down your coins. This is somewhat inessential. If you don't have an internet to receive funds, let other person move their btc's to a paper wallet and give it to you.

Here we go;
I'd like to share you my amateur mining rig. (copy paste)
My Mac Mini 2.4 GHZ Core2Duo mines cryptonight 0.00004817 BTC per day. It consumes 20W. My price per 1kw/h is 0.09 Lira (0.03$) so I must pay 0.0144 Lira per day to electric company for mining. (I'm not paying bills for this.) So my profit is 0.0014451 BTC per month. It makes something like 5 lira. (1.41$)
My i7 2600K cryptonight + 560Ti decred PC consumes 300W, I must pay 19.72 Lira (5.56$) for electricity. Too bad, I must pay this bill. Daily bitcoin amount it mines = 0.00026333 BTC. 1 month = 0.0079 BTC. When I exchange it, it's 28.92 Lira. (8.16$). So my profit is $2.6 per month.
To get profit with Antminer S7, your maximum kh/w price must be 0.11 cents. This will make $0.1357 profit per day. Device price is $800. You'll need 16 years to cover hardware price.
If you are paying 0.05$ per 1 kw/h, you'll cover your S7 hardware price in 1 year.
If my calculations are correct, GTX 1080 mines 70$ worth of Lyra2 encryption in a month. (excluding electricity)

Bad idea.


Yes. 


There are bots that checks balance of bulk addresses. When it gets balance higher than x value, it auto withdraws. I had the same thing in my Netflix account. When netflix was not available in Turkey, I've created an account and bought a subscription with VPN. Cancelled it after 1 month but my password was too week. 1-2 year passed and Netflix came to Turkey. But I didn't buy it for 4-5 years. When I did it, someone changed the e-mail and password of my account in 1-2 days. Only possible reason is, someone figured out my password years ago, there's a bot that checks bulk accounts with valid credit card and subscription info. Bitcoin can be checked within every minute as you like (you own the blockchain database) but I guess Netflix API (or whatever it is) has a quota and it took a day to saw my account.
I don't even trust CPU's random mechanism. I use dice or a coin to create addresses and using my always offline Raspberry pi to do the math and QR code for public address.

Computing power makes you earn bitcoins. And computing is not free, you need hardware + electricity. As I see, if you use 1 GTX 1080 to mine, you can cover it's price in 3 months. So after 3 months, you can buy 1 more and mine with 2xGTX1080s. With this, you can build an amateur rig to mine coins. Just look how much power it's consuming. Some machines mines just to cover it's electricity price. You'll have fun. Google "Nicehash", it's easy to use.

Your transaction has 2 inputs 2 outputs. Size is 372 byte. You've paid 0.00005984 BTC fee so your transaction fee is 16.086 sat/B. Which is low because current optimal fee to get a confirmation in 1st block is 180 sat/b.
This means, you should've paid 0.00066960 BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:07:44

At today's rate, 1 H/s equihash will make you earn $1.45 in a year. 1 H/s price in Hashflare is $20. So you are throwing away your $18.55.
10 GH/s SHA-256 will make you earn $2.39 in a year. It costs you $1.20. While thinking straight, in 1 year, you'll double your money. The problem is, you will not. Your earnings will be cut for maintenance fee.

They are not professionals. Just a trojan owner that made the "virus" archive everything and mail the pass to him. There are lots of ransomware versions that has different owners. Data sent to owner might not be encrypted in older versions. There are lots of people that rescued their db by sniffing already. You can try catching ransom yourself in a virtual machine and you can again sniff the data that have sent. Trojan owner is just living his life and infected systems sends their password to him. Like owning a tomato farm.


Cloud providers regularly do backups. If anything goes down because of a virus, they might say hardware is crashed and we backed it up with the latest one. 
Lets say they didn't have a backup. You are also not guaranteed to get that password work. It's a gamble. Hacker (actually he's just a lamer) might ask for a file to get seed verified. You can also use Kaspersky's ransomware solver archive to get your seed verified too, it has a chance to solve old versions of ransom.

Why is this thing happening? People switched their hashpower to BCH to mine before difficulty raises. Because of this, BTC block mining times raised a bit.
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:08:17
So. Let's say you have 1 private key. It holds some BTC. You've started a transaction of moving BTCs to X address with low fee. If you start another transaction to move your BTCs to Y place with higher fee, and if it gets accepted before the old one, your BTCs will be @ Y address. But, it will get a "double spent" mark. Previous transaction order will get deleted from history. If someone looks at your transaction to Y, they will see a warning about doublespending. It's just a warning about you might be a scammer because you've changed the place that you are sending your bitcoins. You have a chance to scam people like this.
I don't know which wallet are you using. Some soft wallets locks out transfer-ordered funds to save you (or others) from doublespending.

My Mac Mini 2.4 GHZ Core2Duo mines 0.00004817 BTC per day. It consumes 20W. My price per 1kw/h is 0.09 Lira (0.03$) so I must pay 0.0144 Lira per day to electric company for mining. (I'm not paying bills for this.) So my profit is 0.0014451 BTC per month. It makes something like 5 lira. (1.41$)
My i7 2600K + 560Ti PC consumes 300W, I must pay 19.72 Lira (5.56$) for electricity. Too bad, I must pay this bill. Daily bitcoin amount it mines = 0.00026333 BTC. 1 month = 0.0079 BTC. When I exchange it, it's 28.92 Lira. (8.16$). So my profit is $2.6 per month.
To get profit with Antminer S7, your maximum kh/w price must be 0.11 cents. This will make $0.1357 profit per day. Device price is $800. You'll need 16 years to cover hardware price.
If you are paying 0.05$ per 1 kw/h, you'll cover your S7 hardware price in 1 year.

"Normally" a transaction size is something like 250byte. While using  you can set your "good" tx fee ratio. Now the optimum price for 5-10 minutes is 120s/b. To make a cheap transfer "waiting 3-5 hours" to get confirmations, set it to 70s/b. That makes 250*70=17500 satoshi.

My Mac Mini 2.4 GHZ Core2Duo mines 0.00004817 BTC per day. It consumes 20W. My price per 1kw/h is 0.09 Lira (0.03$) so I must pay 0.0144 Lira per day to electric company for mining. (I'm not paying bills for this.) So my profit is 0.0014451 BTC per month. It makes something like 5 lira. (1.41$)
My i7 2600K + 560Ti PC consumes 300W, I must pay 19.72 Lira (5.56$) for electricity. Too bad, I must pay this bill. Daily bitcoin amount it mines = 0.00026333 BTC. 1 month = 0.0079 BTC. When I exchange it, it's 28.92 Lira. (8.16$). So my profit is $2.6 per month.
To get profit with Antminer S7, your maximum kh/w price must be 0.11 cents. This will make $0.1357 profit per day. Device price is $800. You'll need 16 years to cover hardware price.
If you are paying 0.05$ per 1 kw/h, you'll cover your S7 hardware price in 1 year.
Also if my calculations are correct, (didn't try it) GTX 1080 mines 200$ per month. Don't know it's wattage.

Buying from exchanges like Kraken and sending to your "personal" wallet is the best thing you can do. Or buy from Coinbase again, but send them to your wallet with a private key that you hold. Bitcoins are not really yours if you are not controlling your private keys. This will give you extra responsibility but you'll always have your bitcoins until whole blockchain gets erased from the internet.

From now on, everyone will pay 5 dollars to get in, 4 dollar payers will wait 2nd block. 
Spam transaction fees gets paid back to miners. This is why Ripple has tx fee burning and Monero has minimum sat/b barrier to block spam attacks etc.
As long as you pay the fee you want, you will not act how Bitmain wants you to pay. If you are in a hurry, you must pay the fee that Bitmain wants. This is why I always send my transactions with 20-70 sat/b if im not in a hurry.

Nicehash is just a master software that runs mining applications for you. It mines antcoins and you get paid with bitcoins. You'll earn more if you just mine altcoins and hold them but you need some technical info for that. You have Nvidia? Search for mining Zcash and store your coins on a wallet. Wait Zcash's price pump, dump your coins for profit. Are you using an Ati card with more than 4GB ram, search ethereum mining or other DAG based coin. Mine it, hodl, when price rises, sell. Or hodl more. People mined thousands of eth when it was 4$. They hodl. When price raised to 140$, you imagine.

The thing you want is against blockchain mechanism. Wallets are not holding your funds. Blockchain is. I can sell you my 100BTC offline, then uninstall&amp;reinstall another wallet app, go online, get my 100BTC back, and transfer it to another place or sell to another person before you go online.

Private keys owns that block. You are keeping it. If you want to merge 2 private keys into 1, you must transfer those funds with miner fee.
Depositing 1BTC into 1 deposit address = 1 private key holding 1BTC.
Depositing 1BTC into 100 deposit addresses (1/100BTC) = 100 private keys totally holding 1BTC.
Sending 1 BTC with a total of 1 key, will make it count ~320byte = ~32.000 satoshi
Sending 1 BTC with a total of 100 keys, will make it have a really, really have a large size, you'll  give more than 5-10 dollars to transfer it in time.
Recovering seeds on another wallet will not magically merge that 100 keys into 1. You must pay the fee.

This is how blockchain works. Inputs and outputs. Sending 500.000 BTC or 0.001 BTC from 1 input changes nothing. And fee is calculated with sat/b. Not dollars. A normal 1 input 1 output transaction size is 220 byte. So if you are going to pay 300 sat/b fee for it, you need to pay 66000 satoshis.

It's return gives more profit than you are paying. People are now paying 300 sat/b.


When everybody pays 30 sat/b, spam 30 sat/b transactions to make people pay 40-50-60. When everybody pays 60, someone will pay 80 to get in 1st block. When people continue to pay 80, someone else will pay 110 and this goes on like an avalanche. Now, you must pay 350 sat/b to get in 1st / 2nd block. Check 3-5 week's mempool history, when there was no spam, 50 sat/b was guarenteed to get in 1st block.
Segwit is a door to LN, but in short term it will solve the clog because byte size per transaction will drop too (as I remember).

83 sat/b is a cheap fee according to current mempool queue. A miner can accept your transaction if he wants to. Do you have an uncle at Bitmain, Bitfury? Or you must wait for a random one to mine yours. 83 is better than 20 so your luck is higher than them.

My Mac Mini 2.4 GHZ Core2Duo mines 0.00004817 BTC per day. It consumes 20W. My price per 1kw/h is 0.09 Lira (0.03$) so I must pay 0.0144 Lira per day to electric company for mining. (I'm not paying bills for this.) So my profit is 0.0014451 BTC per month. It makes something like 5 lira. (1.41$)
My i7 2600K + 560Ti PC consumes 300W, I must pay 19.72 Lira (5.56$) for electricity. Too bad, I must pay this bill. Daily bitcoin amount it mines = 0.00026333 BTC. 1 month = 0.0079 BTC. When I exchange it, it's 28.92 Lira. (8.16$). So my profit is $2.6 per month.
To get profit with Antminer S7, your maximum kh/w price must be 0.11 cents. This will make $0.1357 profit per day. Device price is $800. You'll need 16 years to cover hardware price.
If you are paying 0.05$ per 1 kw/h, you'll cover your S7 hardware price in 1 year.

Yes but that's the point. They are both a same company or allies and acting like a body with 4 heads. Jihan Wu, Bitmaintech, Roger Ver and ViaBTC. They are on the same side against all others.

"If people start to mine BCH because it's more profitable, BTC chain will die immediately!"
Dumbest argument that I'd ever seen. If you believe in a coin, mine it whenever it is profitable or not, difficulty is low or not. When it gets a pump, you'll take your profit. When coin.dance said it's more profitable to mine BTC, BCH miners mined more coins with lower difficulty. Price raised, they earned more than mining BTC at that time.
Also, everybody that reads news can see Antpool = ViaBTC. They didn't switch Antpool @ Day 1 to BCH chain when it was new to not to lose money, it's somewhat impossible to foresee BCH's future.

Satoshi / Byte. Bitcoin transfers are calculated as bytes. Not their value. 500.000 Bitcoin transaction's fee is equal to 1 Bitcoin transaction's fee. Higher input/output sizes, more fee you pay. If you try to transfer 20 inputs that has 15$ total, you might be going to pay 14$ worth satoshis for that. You should learn how sat/b and transfer sizes work.

Alright. So you say people should not invest into BTC, because, it doesn't have a guarantee. Seems fair, I'm not asking people to sell their car &amp; house and invest to BTC too. Again, invest the amount that you will not starve to death if whole cryptocoin chain disappears all of a sudden. It's profitable than gold in this era and it saves your money against inflation. Where is this mountain of money coming to bitcoin pool? Don't know. But if you check graphics, nobody that bought bitcoin is in dept now. Again, if you don't count 2013 issues, everyone is happy now. Yes this is a risk, you can't delete that 2013 issue from history. So the summary is, never sell your house for bitcoins and know that you are taking a risk. Low or not.
Forex is the real gamble and 10 times dangerous than investing to BTC. Yeah, people are losing money there. Lots of money. Don't even think about forex if you don't have a clue about it. You are losing and someone else is getting rich.
But still everyone is buying BTC. Blockchain traffic might not prove anything but in localbitcoins website, which I'm checking in 2 countries for a refresh rate of 20 seconds, I can easily say more than 1000BTC got sold in 5 hours after the rising movement.

If fiat, gold or stock, yes. Why not in bitcoin? Graph is always rising with a little roller coaster movement (except 2013 incident). I prefer to buy some more btc to hold when it goes down a little bit. I can guarantee myself that if I buy 1BTC today, I can close the buy-sell gap and get some profit, more than fiat inflation. But now, I don't know if this will happen in 2 weeks or 1 month.
Also I'm not burying all my money to BTC. If my wallet gets stolen or whole cryptocurrency system shuts down, I'll not be mad. BTC is not my main investment.

Ledger signs the transaction paper inside the device. You see the target address on it's screen, you press buttons to approve, paper gets signed and goes to your computer. That signed paper cannot be modified, if it is, it gets invalid. (It's cheaper to mine bitcoins instead of having a hash power to break signed transaction papers.) Because of this, it's safe to use ledger on an infected PC.

Running a full node helps decentralisation of Bitcoin. Ledger, Electrum, Mycelium, Bitpay etc are soft wallets that doesn't require you to download whole blockchain. Their server runs Bitcoin core for you. Except Ledger, it is better to use Core for your own maximum safety but instead of downloading the chain, people use trusted opensource soft wallets. Again, Electrum, Mycelium etc.

By this way, you have a guaranteed way to earn money. But not much. People were mining thousands of Ethereum when it was $4. One night, it's price went $140.

What is cryptocurrency system;
What is cryptocurrency mining;
To make money, you must buy/mine it and hold until it's price goes up. Like buying gold. 
Cloud mining websites are scams.
"Give 10 bitcoin and get 20 bitcoin in 100 days" websites are scam.
Faucets are not worth your time, go wash some carpet and you'll earn more.
You can gamble with bitcoin but gambling websites will mostly scam you or legally you'll lose your bitcoins.
Don't store your bitcoins or real money on exchange websites. If website goes down, say goodbye to your money. Use a software or hardware wallet to store your coins.

Basically, you use some processors to solve mathematical equations. For every solution, you get some bitcoins. This was easy at 2011 but now it's too difficult to solve with your normal PC. To mine bitcoin directly, you must have something like this. 
You can mine altcoins with your GPU+CPU. For example if you have 560M GT GPU and i7 2600K CPU, your daily profit will be 0.26333mBTC. Which is 23 cents. After 1 month, when I pay my electric bill, my profit will be 1 dollar. For 1 month. So it's useless. You must have something like GTX 1080 GPU to earn real money but life of the mining devices reduces fast so you should add "minus" your hardware cost to your profit too.
To mine BTC, you have to invest in bitcoin mining machines. Which are expensive and requires lots of electricity. That's why bitcoin mining facilities are in countries that has low kw/h fees.

That's what I'm talking about about not selling your house &amp; car to invest in bitcoin. Invest what you can cover if you lose it all.
My last purchase was at 15 December. Silence before the storm. (got more than %20 profit right now).
3 days ago, I wanted to purchase some but banks were closed at sunday. So no real money transfer. But if it was real, I'd get profit too.
9 hours ago, I wanted to purchase some bitcoins worth something like 1420$ @ lunch break but my friend insisted for lunch and we went outside. When I got back, BTC graphic was going up like a skyrocket. If I'd bought it, I'd get something like 55$ (200 lira in Turkish currency) just in 4 hours. That's incredible. Yes this is a risk but within myself, I feel like I've been touched by the devil. But still, I'm investing that what I can cover if I lose it all.

Yes. Your 12 word phrase is the "maker" of your private keys. The problem is, if anyone sees your 12 word (seed), they can immediately purge all your bitcoin. That's why people buy a hardware wallet like trezor to create a brand new seed that didn't touch any digital device. A iOS device seems safe but if you are holding 900$ worth BTC in it, you better use a hardware wallet (100$).

Torrent is something different. Seeders are not achieving anything. Just uploading some data to other people. Figuring out coin mining while thinking torrent platform will confuse you.
People in pools work together to solve a block faster than solo mining. You can see a pool's total hashrate. For example 100h/s. If you contribute 1 h/s, you'll get %1 of the mined block. Other than that, pool owner will cut a fee from it. So if 1 block is 100BTC, You'll get 1 BTC. Pool owner will cut %1 of it, you'll get 0.9 BTC. Win-Win.
You can also solo-mine but, again for example, if a pool solves 1 block in 1 hour, you'll solo solve a block in 2 weeks.

No it is 1 machine, it's solving cryptonight.
Other algorithms are listed are just from history. I've tried mining with my i7 2600K and 560 Ti PC at other house but it consumes 300W and it's pointless to mine, it covers electricity bill but my profit will be 2 dollars per month. So it's useless to damage my PC. Mac Mini is just a trash machine that is mining for fun. I'm not going to be sad if it gets destroyed.
Totally it's mining for 3 days since I've started I guess. My balance is 0.19018mBTC. It's not much but at least it can cover my bitcoin transfer fees.

Antminer S7 is the oldest device that can give you profit. Yeah I said profit. Something like %30 profit, %70 maintenance/electricity fee etc etc. If someone tries to sell it for a really expensive price, you'll never ROI it.

Basically, altcoin mining is hitting a wall with a pickaxe. Faster, but low profit. Bitcoin mining is hitting a titanium wall with a pickaxe. Slower, but high profit. You can use 1 pickaxe to mine 1 dogecoin but you'll need 100.000 pickaxes to mine 1 bitcoin. Now it is too difficult to mine with a normal PC.

Not 3rd party. You can re-broadcast another payment with same coins with higher fee. If it gets accepted, old order will be deleted from mempool. Your transaction will be marked as "double spent". If you are trading with people, "double spent" mark on your transaction will lower your reputation because people sending BTC with low sat/b can double spend it to another address. This is why people wait 2-3 confirmations before accepting the trade.
I didn't use any CPFP transaction but you can google it to see how it works. Simply, it's another transaction that adds bounty to your 1st transaction that has low fee.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:09:31

For example; buy 1 BTC with 10K USD. And buy 10K USD worth of bitcoin contract.
At the end of the day, when years pass and BTC goes to 20K, your 1 BTC will worth 20K USD but your mining contract will net you something like 0.8 BTC bla bla until the mined coin will not pay it's electricity.

You can't. Send the amount you want to sell to an exchange. Set up an order to sell at $20K. That's all.
To take immediate action on bitcoin, you have to take risks of storing funds on an exchange. Normal exchanges wants 6 confirmation. Block finding time = 10 minute average. This means you'll need more than an 40mins-1hour minimum to get your balance verified.

I'm a bit confused about this. What is that 12 word phrase? People call it "seed". What is a private key then? As I see, Blockchain doesn't give you a private key. So, I assume, 12 word phrase is not a key.
I know Trezor gives you a 12 word phrase too, so you say I can recover it with another bip39 wallet with just using my 12 word phrase or using my private key? Don't know if a trezor device is able to show you it's private key. If Blockchain goes down, can't I use my 12 word phrase to move to another wallet?

Now, forget what an exchance is to learn how Bitcoin works. A wallet application (which is already connecting to bitcoin core if it's lightwallet like Electrum) sends transfer order and funds to miners as fee. Higher the sat/b value (learn what sat/b is. It's not about the BTC value, it's about the transfer announcement byte size that written in that block. From 1 input address to another 1 output address, both 10.000BTC and 0.005BTC will need same fees, same byte size.), it will get accepted in 1st priority. Not faster. Medium of block finding time is 5 minutes. So if you've paid to fit in 1st block, it will get accepted first. Then you have to wait a miner to find a block. According to bitcoinfees estimator, people paid more than 100 sat/b got accepted in 1st block recenty. 20-100 sat/b has a half chance to get you in 2nd block. Already faster than your "less than 20 minutes".
Exchanges holds 5-10-20 transfer orders and executes in one transaction. Also applies custom fees because total fee will be enough to get in 1st block or they want some of the fees to themselves. So, your exchange controls the coins, not you. Exchange is not a wallet. If exchange goes bye-bye without a notification, say bye bye to your coins.

Ok I get it now, last question is answered in 2nd question, thank you.
So, for security, instead of recovering &amp; going with the same phrase, I must transfer all my bitcoins to a brand new 12-word phrased trezor (or another new hardware wallet). After all, the only thing I need to keep secure is my 12 word phrase that is generated from a trezor device.

Binance has lots of pump and dump sh*tcoins and still the best exchange that everybody can use. Doesn't matter if USDT goes to 0. It's between buyer and sellers, not the exchange. USDT holder's loss has nothing to do with it. Exchange only takes the fee by bringing the buyer and seller together.
It is matter if they allow USDT/Fiat. Because exchange itself (user's fiat balance according to usdt) buys your tether and gives you fiat. If USDT goes 0, that exchange will get in a huge dept because they have to pay money to USDT users. Same thing goes with Fiat/cryptocurrency exchanging companies too like Mt.Gox. If you are playing with fiat, there's always a risk called government and scam cryptocurrencies.
But crypto to crypto exchanges like Binance can work everywhere, even on moon. Those exchanges earn money on volatile market because high volumes = high amount of incoming fees. Doesn't matter if BTC is $5 or $50.000.000. They'll still get their money from trade fees. Old days, people were playing with 5000 BTC, today, it's 0.5 BTC. Doesn't matter. They are just taking %0.03-0.01 of your money on every trade. It has nothing to do with tether. If you don't trust tether as an exchange owner, convert your usdt fee earnings to another currency.
I hope you get the point. Exchanges with fiat trading needs to be careful. Crypto to crypto exchanges are safe against any price infraction because they earn money from trades, not coins itself.

I'm not talking about forex, shares or other things. Only bitcoin. Only people that have lost money is the people that bought some in 2013 December. But if they've just hold it, in a month they will get profit. After 3 years. Yeah that's really risky.
I'm advising people to wait and see the graph, instead of doing a bitcoin rush within this critical days. In 1 week, BTC became very popular among newcommers, people that falls into cloud mining scams, ponzi schemes. The motto of mine is, always learn and "always invest the amount of money that you will not regret if it gets lost". If you say real investment must be something that you can hold, %100 global, like gold, I understand. Theres always a chance that bitcoin might drop to the floor, but according to my toughts, (don't mind me) it will not happen sooner or later.
-a gamble story of mine, irrelevant to US / EU Countries-
I'm from Turkey, maybe you heard about the coup and rise of dollar against lira. Everyone here said invest everything to dollar, it's getting high&amp;high. Sounds suspicious because it's fiat, everybody knows there is a roof that it can't go higher. The limit point that it gets manipulated. 1$ was 3.2-3.52 lira at that time. People sait it will be 4 lira. I said instead of dollar, go bitcoin. Now, months passed, I have more than %25 profit and people invested to dollar stays the same. It's still 3.5-3.52$. It's not even covering their exchange rate differences.

Encrypted, in your phone. App itself is secured by pin lock. Backups by your 12 word seed, that you can write on paper. If you lose your phone or get formatted, you can recover your funds back with 12 word seed. If you want a safer solution, it's cold storage on a clean OS. Hardware wallets worth 100$. Easier to use. If you want to store more than 100$, you can buy a Trezor/Ledger etc for storage. You can use Mycelium as an agent for Trezor, even if you are using a compromised phone, your seed/keys will not get out from the hardware device, so it's safe. If you lose your trezor, you can easily recover your funds with your 12 word seed.

Mycellium is personal online wallet. Satoshitango is an exchange wallet "hot wallet", which you use to buy&amp;sell bitcoin for fiat (real money). Not to store your bitcoins. Hot wallet websites might get closed and run away or they might decide not go refund your money. That's why always store your bitcoin in your own wallet and never store large amounts in your hot wallet.
For maximum protection, you should buy a hard wallet like Trezor but it is $100. It is pointless to store $50 worth btc in a $100 priced wallet. So for low amounts, online wallets are fine.

Your question is true. But also it's opposite (supply and demand) is an issue
After halvening, bitcoin getting in market (miners selling to buyers) will get lowered by %50. If miners starts selling them on a higher value and someone buys it, BTC price will get higher. Now, if miners sell 1 BTC per $8K and nobody buys it, price will stay low and some people will need to stop running their devices. Difficulty will get adjusted and we'll still have the same Bitcoin price but fresh supply per hour will be lowered. And some miners will get economically ripped off.

Since BCH is forked from BTC, it's same. Even checksums cannot be aware of it, you can accidentally send bitcoins to a bch wallet address. If you do something like this, you must activate that generated bch wallet seed on BTC chain to retrieve your funds.

Multisig means, a wallet will need more than 1 private key to spend funds. It's like a wallet with more than 1 holders. None of them can personally spend funds.
2FA option is a multisig wallet that one of the key is held within Electrum's 2FA provider's server that can be accessed with Google 2FA. If you lose one of multisig keys, your funds will be locked down forever.
Personally, use a clean (and possibly offline - air gapped) computer with a normal wallet option. Write down your seed to a paper, that's all.

You can prune the blockchain down to 550mb and it will be still a "full node". A 32gb usb stick with prune=25000 worked really fine for a long time. Or you can simply plug in an external HDD and download the whole chain. (don't forget to increase usb voltage in you are using a standalone disk without adapter)
Downloading &amp; verifying the chain might take longer than 3 weeks in Pi3, because of this, I'd suggest you to sync the chain on a normal/fast computer. Copying the chain data to pi3 will make pi3 node work immediately.

You can't cashback a successful bitcoin transaction. You were lucky. Trade like this with people you only trust. It's too risky to trade like this with a stranger. While trading with a stranger like this, wait 3 confirmation and then send fiat if you are the bitcoin buyer.
In LBC escrow system, if he's not sending the money, but pressed "I send" button, you can wait and mail LBC support about this issue. This is your right.

In LBC, you set an amount to sell bitcoins, your BTC's gets locked. Buyer asks your account details and sends money. After he sends, he presses a button to inform you. When you receive it, you release bitcoins.

If it's not fully sync the whole chain, (now, we are in block number 461399), it will not get activated, this is why you might see it's blocked. This command will show you your current block number, this way you can check it with the number that I've gave to you.

Pruning = Blockchain size is something like 120gb. If you enable pruning with a parameter (mb), (25000mb for example), client will fully download and verify 120gb of blockchain traffic but it will only store the last 25GB of chain data, while erasing the old ones. With this option, you can run a "full" node with a 32gb usb stick. As a word, it's not "full" but you can call your synced node a full node if it's allowing connections.

@_date: 2019-08-02 14:48:44
True. But again. I'm talking from the side of exchange owners. Exchanges that makes users trade coin to coin only earns money from fees and has no connection with government for bank accounts. If all crypto prices goes down by %90, they'll still earn money. They might lose reputation. But they will not lose money. Just the opposite, they'll earn more money because trades per second gets higher in panic market.
1 BTC = 10K USD. A person that has 10K usd will buy 1 BTC.
1 BTC = 1 USD. A person that has 10K usd will buy 10K BTC.
1 BTC = 1M USD. A person that has 10K usd will buy 0.0001 bla bla BTC
Higher or lower BTC volume - doesnt matter, "fiat" value is same. But trade numbers goes high to heavens. As an exchange owner, every panic trade storm is an opportunity to earn money. If you see risks at staying on crypto, convert your crypto earnings into fiat every day-week.
As a crypto holder, yeah. You'll sink in a HUGE SH*T because of this unlimitedly minted stablecoin scam. And we know Bitfinex is doing this thing. Printing tether out of nowhere without proofs and poof, BTC goes up. But hey. USD or bla bla fiat gets printed out of thin air too. Can we see USA gold reserves? Nop. But still they are printing USD. Imagine every usd holder wants to buy gold /petrol / foreign currency etc.

If you are going to hold more than 300-500$ worth of bitcoin, buy a hardware wallet like Trezor/Nano S, and hold them in it. Like buying gold and storing it in a safe. Cloud mining return of investment times are longer than 12 months, which will probably cancel before you earn some profit. Just buy and hold and you'll earn "real" money when price goes up.
If cloud mining was profitable, nobody would hodl. Just bury all your money into it and you'll get more profit. -NOT.

Fiat means "real" money. Dollar, Euro etc. When bitcoin transfer starts, it has zero confirmation. When first one happens, you get the money. But there are some tactics to cashback zero and 1 confirmation. 2 confirmation is really hard to revert and 3 is like impossible. Confirmation happens automatically. You should check how transferring bitcoins work.

Yes but you are running a VPS. Your determined settings is not the only thing that opens your way.  In the other comment, you've said that port checker is not saying that it's open. Your VPS may does something else to block people leeching their resources, you should contact them that you want to run a bitcoin node but incoming connections are blocked. They might say "yes we've blocked node operations + dedicated game servers + mining pools etc..."


I see but you've done anything that you can do. (in GUI version you must select "allow incoming connections, don't know about cl version) But something is blocking your way from their side, other than 8333.
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:12:43
Since your last block number is same, looks like it's synced. 
The last thing that I can suggest is disabling (or enabling) upnp. Getting more than 8 connections might take time, you can re-verify your status within 21node website.

Bitcoin difficulty scales with the current hash power, medium of block finding time is 10 minutes. This means if you get a magic wand and wish to destroy every ASIC, GPU, Intel/AMD CPU in the whole world, ARM processors will still able to find bitcoin blocks easily. Average block time will be 1 block per 10 minutes, blockchain will be operated like nothing changed (except fiat price, but hey we are talking about blockchain and mining).
Another explanation: Doesn't matter if the processors people use creates 1 million hashes per second or 5 hashes per second, uses sun cells or a whole nuclear plant. If energy is limited, blockchain's hash value will stay at that limit. Are we at that limit? No.

Yes. Don't know why it got downvoted. Security behind bitcoin is just LARGE numbers that you couldn't see in your daily life, mathematically possible buy practically not. (not talking about breaking SHA)
There are address colliders that just scans to get an address with a balance. They are working for years and still didn't find any random one. Bitaddress just finds a random one. You still have a chance to find an address with a balance in that website. A chance that is kinda same that you are going to the moon by a trampoline.

If you are using old non-HD wallet, every duplicate wallet might have a risk of getting your funds disappear because it's not tied to a seed. After every transaction, you MUST backup it again or your last generated key will get lost. (This is just an info, all known wallet apps are tied to a seed now.)
Wallet files passwords are tied to that file. I guess it's an Electrum wallet file. Which is HD (tied to a seed). If she gets access to it, she can do everything to your all balance within that seed. Now, tomorrow, forever. If you are scared about it, create a new wallet with a new seed. Wallet passwords are independent, if you forget your pass, you can restore a new wallet file with a new pass with your old seed.

You don't need internet to make it work. It can run within an intranet too (but after that it will be just a forked coin because you'll be in a different path with the nodes connected to internet).
If every country blocks themselves like North Korea, with %100 block, no outgoing connection, every country will have their own bitcoin but it will still work. There were some people using satellite internet for nodes or a node on orbit. This will make connection so yeah, it can be independently decentralised.

TLDR; yes it will be upgraded.
If someone has ability to break SHA256, everything you rely on will be open to an attack. This might be your bank or your country's national security. Difference is, Bitcoin can be upgraded to an upper algorithm before a major bank upgrades their system security.

If he hacks your exchange account and sends BTC's to another exchange you have a right to legally track and accuse of theft. You can't prove that this address is yours.

Hmm. If it is using your master seed with a different derivation path, you have a chance.
For example when you open Ledger app, it asks you to use Segwit or Legacy addresses. If you have funds in legacy, segwit menu will be zero. If you have both balances in segwit and legacy, you can't access the other one. But you can copy the address in segwit menu and use legacy menu to send all of your funds to your segwit address.
If device generates segwit addresses without using your seed, this might create a problem if you lose your ledger. This is why I believe it uses your seed with different derivation path. But believing it doesn't mean it will be true. I'm curious about this too. Monitoring this thread.

You are buying contracts with fiat and and they are paying back what you can buy now. Also you can't sell it back if you want to exit. Do you have $4650 to pay? Good luck owning 1 BTC after a year. It's a scam, another way to trick you. Scam doesn't mean that they will rob you and run away. Can you sell back your physical antminers? Yeah. Can you sell back your contract? No. Good luck for mining what you could have already own. Also their maintenance fee is high. USD 0.28 per TH/s is not "cheap". They don't say what pool they are using. They don't say what device you'll use to mine. You can't magically split a device to mine both BTC and UNO. They are paying you what they are mining. You are giving money to them to operate their mining facility and they are giving back some shares. That's all. Yeah they are using physical miners. But not for you.

Accounts are tied to one seed. With a different derivation path. For example 0/0, 0/1, 0/2... This is why 1 account cannot see other one's balance even if they are both tied to one seed.
Enable advanced settings in Mycelium to see the derivation path of it. Electrum has advanced settings in restore function to enter customised derivation path. By this way, you can secure your different accounts on that seed.
Breadwallet's seed has different derivation path than normal wallets. When you enter Breadwallet seed to Electrum, you must enter that derivation path or else you'll see zero balance.

Bitcoin (blockchain) has nothing to do with the internet owner. It's trustless because of cryptography. Owner of the private key can do whatever he wants.

Scam has a broad meaning but I personally experienced Minergate's stealing hashrate profits (+ it's a botnet) and Freewallet's robbery. Since changelly is their too, terrible rates are a legit way to rob you. Didn't use shapeshift but I can imagine their rates too. Giving 100 excellent service and hitting 101st person looks legit, and gives you profit. personally I don't recommend it and before you use it, know what might happen to you.
I saw terrible experiences with greenaddress too but front page post shows that people loves it. Can't say anything for that.

You've discovered this "never sell bitcoins under the value that you've bought or else you'll lose money". Common sense.
"I didn't make this purchase with BTC's a year ago and now I can buy 3 phones instead of 1" is not an healthy logic. You are still paying 3 phone price for 3 phones, because you've earned fiat for 2 phones. Pay with your salary, or pay with your bitcoins. Doesn't matter.

Does segwit addresses has a different derivation addresses than your normal addresses? Don't know how generating segwit addresses work. Electrum has an option to customise your derivation address when importing your seed. If you write segwit derivation address while restoring your seed (if it works like this) you'll get your funds back. (don't know if BTC Core gives you seed words either).
Breadwallet seed will show zero balance with normal derivation address. You need to customise it to access your funds in other wallet app.

I don't think it's practical but I'm not a code pro either. Theoretically you can find a way to make it work with an app, reading data from chain. You can even select a block as a jumpstart data with your phone app and add more and more steps to make it upgrade itself but practically never seen anything about this.
As I think about this, it looks like sending a scout to another dimension with no communication. You've made an app but how would it know next N block will continue to store the next data? Maybe you'll need to host a text file with just numbers on it and your app will decode the numbers like a map and look for the real data on blockchain. This method is not perfect, but seems fine as a roadmap until you find something better, %100 headless app with fully blockchain compatible.

Guesses show 2140 but it will not go to zero from 12.5 BTC. After lots of halving, miners will only get some satoshis as block prizes in 2100's. Transfer fees will make them continue already before the last block prize gets mined.

Yes that's a solution. You can try to separate your coins on the private keys that you own, when BTC and B2X are confirmed on 2 different private keys, you are safe. But this might be tricky a bit. You'll might to make some double spending.
Bittrex is a trusted exchange. After seperating coins, I can try to exchange it there. But because of the replay protection thing, exchanges might act different. Like, when BCH came, Bittrex made you wait 100 confirmations. Which made us wait more than 1 day.

That's a paradox. Bigger blocks for fitting everyone in = centralisation risk. BCH's 8mb block size = getting accepted in 1st block with 0.005 cent is not a solution for long term.

Public key is the hole of a piggy bank. You can post it anywhere. You can send bitcoins to it anytime you want. For 1 time or 1000 time, doesn't matter.
Private key is the key of that piggy bank. Who owns that key, owns the value of that safe. If you enter it to a notepad and save it on your pc, it's exposed and not safe for use again.
There are viruses (bitclip) that understands that you've copied a bitcoin public address (magic of checksum algorithm), when you paste your clipboard, you paste hackers's public address. If you are going to send coins without checking it twice, your coins are gone forever. There are lots of methods for cryptocurrency theft. Because of this, never save your private key to a digital place. Never print it via smart printer, it's cache might hold the document. Never CTRL+P from a browser, print command saves PDF of that file in cache and prints the document. A virus can check cached PDF's for a key etc etc. Never trust anyone if the issue is your private key.

Sorry for the long post but I get upset when people use these "scammy" cloud mining websites. I'm not saying Genesis is a thief. If they are paying what you could already own, I say it's a scam. Plus, who knows when their contracts will end? "Open-Ended Bitcoin Mining" Yeah. Open-Ended. They'll cancel it whenever they want. I'll bet that when your earnings gets more than 1.8 - 2, they'll cancel it.
Hashnest is Bitmain's website. The company that produces Antminers. They don't need any youtuber to promote themselves or a fancy website, choice is yours.
You'll earn your 1.69 bitcoins back in Genesis. Problem is, you can already buy 1.69 BTC right now. Why don't you lend me 1 BTC and I'll give you 1.2 BTC back in a year? :) Your contract will get cancelled when you start to earn more and you'll say, "whoa I've mined 1.69 BTC"
Just explaining how Hashnest works, buy or not I'm not earning anything since there is no referral system. If something has a referral, it will morph into a pyramid scheme. In Hashnest, there is a marketplace that you can buy device power directly with BTC/LTC. No timed contracts, no fiat, just device hashpower. 1 GHS of S9 device is 0.00006519 BTC. Right now, you can buy 1000 GHs for 0.06519 BTC. Or just buy 10 GHs to try out how it works. You'll immediatly start earning when Antpool mines a block. Want to bail out? You can sell back your hashpower at the marketplace. If the price raised after you've bought your hashpower, you'll get back more bitcoins / litecoins + the ones that you've mined. You can directly buy a device with a cheaper price and in 72 hours, they will start running it for you but deviced are all out of stock, so the only choice is hash marketplace. Your hash will stay valid until it earns something. Antminer S7 still mines bitcoin and it's profitable. That's all. You can't sell back your contract at Genesis, Hashflare etc.
If I had 1.69 BTC to put in experiments, Genesis will be the last place that I'll lend my money.

Don't know any source, only experience. For example there is a bitclip virus that changes your clipboard when you copy a public address you'll send funds. When you paste the address, you paste hacker's address and if you don't double check it, you'll lose your money.
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:36:54
Yes because you've sent it to another address. You've copied "Colorado" and computer pasted "Monaco" because of that virus. Your money didn't go to Colorado. Always double, triple check when you are sending money. Don't copy paste directly.

These devices holds private key. Seed gets generated within the device and you write it within it's screen. Nothing touches to PC/Phone. Transfer gets signed within the device, your keys are not exposed to any online device. Device itself is a safe. Also, they support multiple currencies. You don't need to download off of their wallets to your PC/Phone.

Sorry, your question gave me a mindf*ck.
Bitcoins are stored in addresses. Addresses has both public and private keys. You send coins to a public address. To take it out, you need it's private key. As you can see, owner of the key is the owner of that address. Coinbase holds your key. If coinbase closes to oblivion, say goodbye to your coins. If you are holding coins in an address that it's key is not explosed, known only by you, you own those coins. You'll own it until the blockchain totally gets destroyed. This is why people say "not your keys, not your coins". 


You are controlling an account that Coinbase gives you. You are lending your coins to coinbase and they give you an account. Like banks.

Segwit is just a soft update. It will remain in Bitcoin chain. Other than that, if you are using Ledger on Mycelium Android via OTG cable, you must use Legacy addresses to make it sync.

Breadwallet seed is not directly compatible with Electrum/Jaxx so it's normal that you didn't see any balance. Derivation path is different, you must set it right. So your balance isn't lost (unless you really moved it).
Other than that, don't know about your Breadwallet connection problem. Maybe try another wi-fi or cellular net.

World is a poker table. There are dealers and ledgers. If you manipulate 1 ledger, others will ignore it. Ledgers listen dealers and when 1 dealer founds a block, it gets validated worldwide. If it's legal, then it's mature. If it's fake/not a valid block, it will get orphaned.
Public ledger is bitcoin blockchain. SHA256 encrypted. Every person on earth has access to it, nobody had the ability to crack it and access to private keys.

You sign a message with your private key. Like a message sealed with your sign at middle ages. Signing a message is free. You can do it on Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Mycelium Android, Ledger, Trezor etc etc, softwares that capable to do it.
When someone wants you to prove that you own the private key of a public address, you sign that message with it's private key. There are sign checker softwares that you can validate if it's legit when you are getting a signed message from someone else. If you are joining a token airdrop, you prove you own that bitcoins on that key, system gives you a message, you sign that message with your key, when you give it back, it validates it.

Owning private keys is the safest way to store bitcoins. If fork happens, you have to activate your keys on the other chain. This means extra job.
Storing coins on exchange is not the best thing you can do. But if exchange says they'll give you forked coins, it will save you from some extra job.

Type your electrum receive address to blockchain expolorer and see if your transaction is started. (this should be seen in Electrum too)
Master public key is a key that tied to your seed's public key generation value. You can keep it as a "watch only address". You can't spend funds with it but you can check your seed's balance. Every generated address balance that tied to your seed. You can enter your wife's master public key to your Mycelium Android (or Electrum etc.) like a normal key and you can check her total balance on that seed etc. But you can't spend it.

This is just a fool-proof app that also gets benefit with your lack of knowledge. A parasite app. If you want to mine with maximum profit using your computer CPU, search for XMR-Stak app and mine Cryptonite coins. That's the most effective one for CPU. Problem is, you must chose the coin you'll mine carefully. For example both Monero, Electrum and Intense uses same algo but if you think about $ per day, Intense was 3-4 times higher than Monero. Because of this, it's pointless to mine Monero. Botnet already mines it for it's users.

At that website, it has 2 sections. Single Wallet and Paper wallet. At first you move your mouse to generate a seed. Don't use that address. At paper wallet page, you can generate an address with BIP38 encrypted private key with pass. When I've generated a key, importing pw key to Mycelium, it asked me the password of this private key. I've entered a wrong password and after waiting 3-5 seconds, it said decryption password was wrong. This means it's working. The page you've generated the key was wrong I guess.

That is true, but we are not setting a gmail password either. $5 wrench attack argument easily works for this wallet. Wallet might be the most secure thing on earth, but human nature is not. People love to brag about what device they use or how much crypto they have.
A thief targets you, knows how device's key system works, good luck convincing him that you don't remember the phrase. Other than device security, wallets that gives you seeds that impossible to remember and pins that wipes device after 3 wrong try is much secure than a long but easy-to-remember phrases.
Sorry for acting paranoid but I'm thinking much more about real-life, other than software security because I already have a knowledge up to using core on an offline machine to sign transactions. Other half of the userbase might find that Bitfi method useful.

In Bitpay address page, it will wait 10-15 minutes for a payment to start. When you start a payment, it will see bitcoins are coming and it will wait for a confirmation by informing you in the same page. After your payment gets a confirmation, it will get processed and you'll have your item.

Usually that means 1st pw key is used and 2nd pw key empty waiting for new deposit. 2nd one is empty for sure (newly generated address) but 1st one must be checked at blockchain explorer to see it's final balance.
Second question, nothing can go wrong you can enter your seed wherever you want but if a malware/hacker sees that seed, it can control your balance. So when you finish your job, move all your balances to a fresh seed and delete the exposed one. Just to be safe.

Download bitaddress generator from it's github repository to an offline machine like Raspberry pi or a pc dedicated for this. Air-gapped. Generate your key via flipping a coin for 256 times with it's hex. (pure randomness). Write down your private and public key to a paper, next, boot with an OS Installer or disc rescue program and wipe the drive's surface. Not quick format, long format. Now you are good to go.

Seed is a word that generates your special private keys. If your pc gets destroyed etc, you can always recover your funds with it.

@_date: 2018-07-08 08:46:42
I got your idea, but it's too pointless for someone to use it and a waste of plastic. Just print a business card, 10 times cheaper and eco friendly.
My idea, print public key on front and private key on back behind a scratch surface or another security band. By this way, you can simply create an empty gift card (user will top it up) to use in weddings, friendly gifts, business checks etc. You might want to include user manual on back side for what is private key and how to redeem it.
Or, still create the same card and top it yourself. Print a card with a key, top it 0.025BTC, which will cost you 170$ including the card itself. Then sell it for 180$. Easy 10$ profit per card will save people that doesn't know how exchanges work or people who wants anonymity. Actually you might want to include some security holograms etc. The thing I'm saying is just an actually casascius physical bitcoin, in a card form. You can easily sell these cards to stores, just get in a professional level.

A friendly advice. Instead of investing cloud mining, buy miner devices yourself or just buy the coin you want to mine.

NiceHash is a good system for amateurs afterall but running miners on your own makes me getting more hashrate and mining within a public pool will make me hold those coins for the best price.

You cannot mine XMR with GPU with Nicehash. It forces me to mine Zcash or Decred with my GTX 560Ti. Don't remember what it gives but mining XMR by myself gives me 170h/s. Much better gains, instead of mining Decred/ZEC.
I also have a spare tower that has 100h/s CPU power. Total hashrate is 550h/s on 12h average. When I divide my weekly gains into hours, it makes 0.0022 XMR/h.

BTC price tripled in 7 months. Bought for 100? It's 300 now. Imagine that you've bought it for 1000, 3000 now. Sold your car for bitcoins? You can buy 3 cars now. Like this. You'll not get rich with 100$ but you'll earn more than your bank's interest rates if BTC price continues to grow. (in long term, yeah it will). That's why you shouldn't invest the money you'll need soon. Don't sell your car for bitcoins if you don't have an income to buy 1 car in 5 months.

For example this is a transaction from 2016. Somebody took 0.2BTC from a 308BTC address. I can trace it. I can trace it to it's creation date to today's location. Problem is, I don't know who owns this public addresses. If somebody says this is Bill Gates's address, you can see the public addresses today which holds the coins that Bill Gates touched. Or they are still his coins. Just in a different address. Who knows. But for example, if you get Monero from someone, you can't trace it. You can't see who got how many moneros. Fully anonymous. 
I can trace your 500$ BTC but the thing I'll see is an address like 1fdgdhdHDG4t34tegET43543fsds. Who owns it? Don't know. But it's anonymously there until somebody says 1fdgdhdHDG4t34tegET43543fsds is mine.

You've downloaded it's source code from Github. You cannot run it, you need to compile it. There are already compiled versions on internet so you can find one. It works with command parameters, you can find them on it's github page's info.

There must be a gap in block to reset the price treshold. For example today I made a transaction with 36 sat/b and I knew I was going to wait 2 days. Guess what, it got confirmed in 1st block. Why should I pay 280 sat/b next time?
On the other hand, it's like an exchange. Everyone buys BTC for 2100$. What happens if I slowly dump 50.000 BTC for 2800$? BTC price is 2800$ now even if I'm not attacking now. When price drops to 2600, people will rush to buy cheap coins. What happens if I fill blocks with 120 sat/byte transactions? People will start to pay 150. What happens when 150 sat/b fills the 1st block, people will pay 200 sat/b to get in. What happens if I stop it, both 50 sat/b and 200 sat/b will get in. Next time, the guy who paid 200 will pay 50. Fee calculator works like this, it sees that 30 sat/b got confirmed at 1st block, next time, it will lower the info value of optimum tx fee.

Bigger blocks, more transactions to fill it. In short term, yeah everybody will be happy with instant confirmations with really cheap fees. A year later or sooner (bitcoin gets popular faster than ever now), when it gets %100 filled, people will start to pay higher fees. Let's make a guess, 320+ sat/byte to get a confirmation @ 1st block. 1mb block filled with bottleneck transactions nets them 3-4 bitcoins tx prize. Imagine 8mb block filled with 320+ sat/byte bottleneck transactions. TX prize will be higher than block prize even if there's no prize halving.
Last 6 months, miners attack blockchain with spamming little transactions to make people pay more fee. Miners are already getting what they've paid, but normal BTC users pay higher fees to. Imagine everybody pays 350 sat/b to get in the 1st block. Someone will pay 400 sat/b to get in 1st next time.

Yep. Your private key unlocks your portion on the chain. If chain splits on hardfork, you can use the same key on Bitcoin chain and Bitcoin ABC chain because before the chain, your portion was there. Think like it's a train road that splits into two. So if you have 1 BTC, you'll have 1 BTC ABC too. If you move funds to your address after hard fork, Bitcoin ABC portion of your private key will be empty.
If Electrum supports the old chain, just export use your private key on Bitcoin ABC core or another app that supports it, then you can control your ABCs.
This thing works on ETH/ETC too. A friend of mine accidentally sent his ETHs from exchange to his ETC address, so you'll think that it's lost. But not. He use that ETC private key on ETH chain and got back his coins. (don't know if this will work soon)

Jihan supported chain scaling because he'll going to earn 8 times more tx fee. Just scaling block size will not solve anything. Just saves the day. What will happen a year later when 8x people try to fit in a 8mb block? 8 times more 350 sat/b fees to earn. Looks cool eh, act like you are trying to solve the bottleneck, earn more. BU is not Bitcoin Jesus.

I'm selling regional iTunes cards for Bitcoin. People who've contacted me 2-3 months ago feels sorry about the Bitcoins they've paid me because it's price doubled. This means, they've bought 100$ worth of card for 200$. I always try to hodl on and spend fiat instead of coins as possible.

Tails OS runs on ram. If you have a pi, it uses SD card as a hard drive to boot OS. Just buy a cheap SD card, create offline 5-10-20 addresses and destroy the card if you are too paranoid. I prefer writing them to paper myself while the device is offline. No printer issue. Vanitygen is an opensource app that creates random and personal private&amp;public keys.

The buyer will send those bitcoins to another wallet too. What's the difference?

Doesn't matter. More hash power, more mined blocks, higher difficulty. Don't have any worries. If a pool gets more than %51 hashpower, well, they can start manipulations. That's why people doesn't want hard fork &amp; China centralization. You can see the distribution here.

Check the other comment. You can't really know who buys bitcoins. Bitcoin exchanges works on supply-demand. Sellers chooses price to sell, buyers chooses the price to buy.

I knew Trezor had an hidden passphrase (unlock code) for a decoy wallet, but not Ledger. Which device has that option? Because Nano S has no option for another passphrase (8 digits to unlock the device). If you've meant another 12-25 words, you can do it with every wallet.

Tried mining with S9 "hashrate" with 0.097 BTC for 5 days. Indexed on an Excel file and I saw that instead of using S9, L3+ profits way more fast and sold back what I've bought from S9 market. Funny thing is, I've earned more bitcoins by just selling my hashrate + the ones that I've mined is also a bonus.

Can't run faster than bullet imo. Acting like a stupid sassy and giving out your decoy wallet might be better sometimes, always be prepared.

You've pointed out a bigger problem. Every month, same byte amount of transaction gets expensive according to fiat. We are not only using bitcoin in our daily shoppings. This is why Ethereum's Gas system for transaction fees are better. (Transaction fees gets cheaper or expensive according to hashpower/electricity you are consuming to get it verified according to fiat)
On the other hand, you are right but Bitmain itself pumps (attacks) blockchain with a shtload of low amount to make people pay more sat/b fees. Jihan himself said he's not ok with Segwit's low tx fees. I'm not ok to pay expensive fees because of a short-arse. I'm not that "I'll buy coffee with bitcoin" guy but if bitcoin ecosystem wants you to pay 300 sat/b without anyone attacking, I'm ok with that. Problem is the attackers.

You can use the same address again. It's tied to your seed. If your seed is lost with your device, say goodbye.

Bitcoin fees are calculated in sat/byte. Let's say a single 1-1 transfer is 220byte and optimum fee is 360 sat/byte. You should pay 79200 satoshis for a normal transfer.

S9 GH/s's bought in Hashnest (no, it's not ponzi or scam) marketplace "ROI" in 9 months within todays difficulty (including their maintenance + electricity fee) also (you can sell them back so double the profit). The physical device is cheaper and it will ROI in less than 8 months. You'll still get profit even with BTC cloud mining but if you are looking for a way to get rich fast, running latest batch of L3+ will make ROI in less than 4-5 months and LTC has a higher chance to double/triple it's price. First batch of L3+ had "ROI" in 1.5 months.

They've forked (cloned) Bitcoin before BTC chain segwit activation. After segwit activation, BCH was the old bitcoin software. BTC was upgraded into a different thing. BUT, later they've increased BCH's blocksize cap to 8mb. Which also made it different than the old bitcoin.
You are also free to clone the current bitcoin chain. But you need supporters to support it. That's how BCH succeed. Roger Vermin and his friend Jihad Wu (Bitmain) advertised it as the real Bitcoin, even if it has 8mb block size.
Btw they didn't want segwit because of asicboost. (google it)

Breadwallet's seed is in old format but compatible. You need to enable legacy BIP format and use a different derivation path. Might sounds messy but end of the day, it supports.
