I did answer u/acered24, summery is BlackHole use Blockstack DNS to address users hubs that give access to the encrypted and private storage, that has the keys for all others encrypted and anonymous random hubs.

As BlackHole protocol works on top of Blockstack network, it uses it's domain name to let users have their private hub that keeps any info and keys to other random hubs that host the encrypted parts.
"Blockstack uses a new domain name system (DNS) built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain as the basis for these dapps. The DNS allows users to attach information to identities stored on the blockchain. The decentralized DNS allows users to communicate and connect with one another in a direct, secure and encrypted manner."

Yes, link to [Github repos]( is on the [website]( Thanks for the input and attention.

Let me know if you want to know more.

I can understand your point, but honestly I did not post it as in shotgun approach. One of our goal is to let users know they can use the "blockchain" technology in an easy way and they should not think about it as a complicated thing.

Hi u/fresheneesz and sorry for the confusion.
We don't store the files on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is not optimized for that. BlackHole use Bitcoin blockchain to address users names and find their hub to store the keys to random encrypted hubs.
Actually, you can use your own Gaia provider (storage provider of Blockstack) hosted on popular services like AWS or Azure. What BlackHole do is give you a much simpler way to share files securely.

 BlackHole is secure, server-less file transfer that works with blockchain technology.
It's an open-source project and available for Windows and Mac.
It is on Product Hunt too: [
