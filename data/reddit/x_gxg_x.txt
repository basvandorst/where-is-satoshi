*Disclaimer; this is simply theoretical; this is not to be used for advice*
Suppose the following:
-Suppose 50 coins were purchased early on with cash
-Bitcoin soars to $50,000+ per coin.  This is not being naive as I am well aware that it could hit 0 in the next 10 minutes.
-User holds a stake say 50 coins
-Coins have never been exchanged for fiat
-Coins have been transferred from wallet to wallet to Trezzor with passes through tumblers/mixers and other methods to simply maintain privacy - in other words while privacy was achieved no records exist
-Most recent wallet shows only a balance of 10 coins, nothing else
-No taxes have ever been filed recognizing these coins
-In the year that Bitcoin hits $50,000.00 per coin, the user attempts to sell all 50 coins for a total of $2,500,000.00
-Files taxes in that year and pays long term capital gains tax (assuming a cost basis of 0.00 since no records are available) of 20% of $2,500,000.00 which is $500,000.00 and keeps $2,000,000.00
-Because it is so large is this ok with the IRS? 
-Even in the event of an audit, what would happen? Taxes were paid.
-Is there a chance they simply would not like the fact that it is crypto and just attempt to seize all of it and pursue active criminal investigations like they seem to have done to someone in FL
-Or, would they be happy and just take what I told them and accept that I had no clue Bitcoin was going to pop and failed to properly record everything which would be the reason a 0.00 basis was used?
-As odd as it sounds, if Bitcoin were to go to $50,000.00 assuming 0.00 cost basis wouldn't really be an issue, would it raise red flags to them?
-Would they go back and attempt to recreate records?
-- What would happen then?
-Would they be upset privacy methods were used? Early on I did not clearly understand blockchain - I was simply a techy geeky nerd who got excited over the possibility.  With all the banks getting hacked and user data stolen, I believed I was safest moving coins every year or so to a new computer, as a computer geek, I know that hard drives fail.  Trezzor was not around back then.
-Assume the coins remain on a Trezzor device from now until 2030
-Assume the *'income'* tax rate is higher, would they attempt to classify it as income and make me prove other wise knowing that I couldn't? Knowing I practically destroyed any and all records for the sake of computer safety and protecting my finances.
-Would they begin watching me asking where a few million dollars came from and thoroughly analyze my entire life? 
-Thoughts on this ? Good , bad? Any suggestions?
*it would be nice to get lucky and see a little gamble sky rocket, but at the same time I have no desires to open up a can of worms with the gov*

Regarding the 10btc I changed it.  It only shows a balance of 50 coins *received on July 26 of 2016* even though they had been held much longer.

Well, either way there would be taxation involved.
@_date: 2017-05-02 01:04:22
In other word you think it would be ok?

I am not not paying taxes - I want to pay the taxes when they are due.  I question whether the IRS would get very nosey and start searching for everything and anything they possibly could to frame a criminal (ie No records, seeking privacy etc.) It just seems all to familiar in the news and increasingly I am sensing greed.  I wouldn't be surprised if they just tried to take the whole xx million that it could possibly turn out to be.
Picture this:  fast forward to 2030 and imagine transfer of the coins to the final hardware location 13 years prior in 2017(today) assume the value at that time is a total of $50,000.00 and that is the last record I can prove will they then ask for the data supporting the purchase even if I bought nearly a decade ago?  The very real chance is that it could be $1mln it could be $10mln when that day comes and I am fearful they would just seize the coins questioning "where did this $10mln come out of thin air?"
**EVEN** if all taxes were paid and 0 basis was used.
Thoughts?
