Can it virtualize an os (linux, mac, windows)?
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:46:15
It's never the right time!
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:58:26
Yes, I don't understand either.

Nicehash is just a pool mining. How can you invest? Maybe a trap to hide the crime?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:41:14
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:45:17
It happens to me, too, and also when I buy it dips, too. Never the right time! 
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:13:49
It is complicated but you can try a reverse shell. Basically if you have a remote server with program listening to a local port you can use a reverse shell to connect that remote port to a a local port wherever you sit.
@_date: 2018-08-28 12:12:23
Hey I can help with this. Pm me for more info.

How much is the fee?
@_date: 2019-11-05 17:52:12
I just wonder why France is so big and has so few people!? It's because they hate France there are only frogs to eat! China had always big population because it's nice there and there is plenty of good food!!

Do me a favor and take Russia with you. Why are they considered east anyway? They look mostly like western except Mongolia. They are your friends and communists!
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:42:25
Fireworks are china's invention and I think many more. China has 5000 years culture. Western is nothing compared to this. Western got very lucky and made right decisions but lack of experience!

You remind me of addicts and co-addicts. What will you do without China? They buy a lot of stuff from western. It's not that easy. Go ahead. Destroy all bridges and ways to China, and farewell :).
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:16:16
Nice video btw.
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:53:01
You mad? China has also biggest population 1000 years ago! China land is top for food! They just got arrogance like the western now! Also food is very good in China! Don't you like Chinese food?

Why would you transfer it out to other exchanges?
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:50:16
It's an illusion.
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:39:39
35% here, in fact only 25%.
@_date: 2019-06-01 14:51:34
Yes, I did. It took from several hours to days in my experience.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:20:41
How much?

Is the AT&amp;T bug bounty only for AT&amp;T websites, devices etc. pp? Care to elaborate? Is there a list of all bugs? There is only the hall of fame but not the found bug?
@_date: 2019-06-17 22:23:36
Because of family and friends.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:23:19
I am in.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:23:45
But with the AT&amp;T website? What bugs? Facebook API? How come you can code?
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:53:15
Where can I find those options? I have Electrum 2.6.4? Is it safe to upgrade? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:43:28
Did they know you are 14?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:07:41


Your website doesn't work:
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:31:14
Coinbase and Kraken.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:39:57
Nice. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:25:18
Before some days I also sent 0.1 btc for $0.50 fee with my wallet. I had to wait a day. It seems to work! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:39:27
Not only AT&amp;T? Apple, Google, Facebook, too?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:33:53


Do you mean I am an attention whore? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:00:38
Did they know you are 14?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:36:30
8k and your 14? Nice work but a little overpaid. Did they know your so young?
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:26:01
I also just sent 0.1 btc with 20 sat / byte. It took only 1.5 days.

It's called life. Unfortunatley I am not 14 anymore. Life is a bitch.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:26:32
It's a scam. They do it with unemployed, too. They want to pay in advance for the work and ask you to pay co-workers etc. Of course the cheque is fake and you lost all your money!
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:30:14
If I remembered it is like 0.0013 btc  per day. I could get the miner from a friend for free but I didn't.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:12:28
But that its not the meaning. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:47:50
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:00:10
Maybe a language thing.

PoS isn't so soon. Maybe 1 year from now!
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:59:48


Yes, you are right. It's highly unlikely but not impossible. Maybe they used serious GPU power. For example mining rigs for ethereum. It's serious computing power.     
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:11:28
Yes. I think you are right.
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:59:12
How much is the fee when you buy? Coinbase is very high. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:28:29
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:51:04
What script is it? What browser did you used? What website did you visited?
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:25:12
Me too. Most of the time when I buy the price tanks.

Why I am not listed? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:03:36
I just sent $31 with electrum and paid $0.22 fee. It took a day but the fee seems relatively cheap to me.    
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:30:28
Did you changed the transaction speed to slow in coinbase? It gives less fee!  
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:21:10
Nicehash pays in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:56:13
IMO it's invented in the financial crisis for the poor. It's not for the rich. The rich can piss off.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:28:46
What about Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:32:37
Huh? I know for sure it was $700-900 in Jan 2016? Look at coinbase. It gives the same! 
Edit: ups. Confused 2017 with 2016!
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:10:28
Thanks. I still don't understand. Is it the difference? Wouldn't it be easier to sort the list and pick the first item when it fits and repeat. It is used in bin packing.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:09:56
No, I just bought some xbt.
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:44:43

But it's only the artist name? Nobody cares!
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:13:13
If you have the wallet you can do it offline. I don't know if electrum has brute-force protection but there are of course tools to brute-force.  Jack the ripper for example.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:37:31
Nevermind. I confused 2017 with 2016.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:04:26
Transfer to Kraken and sell there. However I don't know about fiat withdrawal fees. 
@_date: 2019-09-09 14:14:45
Lol. You watched too much movies. Maybe it's from Microsoft Rewards bot or similar payout bots.
Or hitman money laundering.

What about Gemini?
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:44:27
Are you sure? I asked gdax support to no avail. Can you also sell with Gdax?
@_date: 2016-05-01 21:03:50
You can try my Bing rewards bot (bbrb.codeplex.com).

Can you short with gdax.com?
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:04:31
Care to elaborate? How come a miner earn fees? Can everbody becomes a miner and earns fees? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:51:25
Antminer is 1kw/h!
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:30:14
IMO the target hash start with a 0. For example 0abcdef then with 00 -&gt; 00bcdef etc. pp. To get there you must try all possibilities with the crypto algorithm thus it takes so long!

He lost 21k:
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:28:22
Short selling. He sells not his own (others) btc and hopes he can buy them cheaper. The difference is his win (payement).
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:45:12
Is it true? What about the cost for accounts and banksters?
Is it more profitable?
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:37:34

Maybe blockchain.info? Is it free?
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:46:34
I am also french. I think it's normal but I never had the sms from a 5-digit coinbase number! Maybe it's from your mobile provider?
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:03:04
No, I mean the online service is blockchain.info? Could be they have their own server? IMO blockchain.info shares a lot!

Hmm. You are right. 1st code from coinbase came from 3XXXX and the next from 06XXX.. IDK what happend?
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:32:47
How does it work without the full blockchain?
