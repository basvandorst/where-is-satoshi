tell california to go fuck themselves. socialists will not control the new form of currency.
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:22:07
the government does not liek it one bit that the people are finding another currency that they have full control over. who is going to line the governments pockets with sweet delicious currency if they have no control on how it gets spent or made. they will play the it will unbalance the economy card. but it will only unbalance their economy, not ours =P
