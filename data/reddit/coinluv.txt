My own lesson: Don't buy because some Bozo on YouTube says so. DYOR

I was reluctant to try Gemini because I had dumb preconceived notions about the Winklevoss twins.
Coinbase is such a ripoff and the customer service horrific.  So, I went over to Gemini and haven't looked back.
They converted me into a fan:
1) Instant trading - don't have to wait for a week and bank clearance
2) Don't charge to put funds in.
3) Low transaction fees
4) Actually get a reply from customer support within an hour
5) Easy to use

No need to be so mean or rude. Hope everyone does well in crypto land.

Yesterday when BTC hit $4,400 I set my alarm to let me know if it dipped below $4,000 so I could sell before it fell back to $3,000 or whatever. I woke up to the alarm going off and sat frozen afraid to sell in case it suddenly shot back up. After staring at the numbers flicker from $4,200 down to $4,020 and everywhere in between, I'm going back to bed and ride the wave. HODL.

HA HA! Hopefully it won't like the Consensus bust.

Question. If I leave my BTC in the exchange, use a zero interest credit card for everyday purchases then pay off the card with BTC profits is that the same?
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:28:26
Not to be morbid but...no one knows how long they are going to live, so enjoy your profits and save some BTC for a rainy day.

They are a doorway to shut behind you.

This article reads like a paid ad.  Search Poloniex on Reddit and Twitter they are holding millions of dollars in customer funds and not responding to tickets.  Any honest review would not gloss over their gross negligence and abominable customer service so lightly.  Can you ask Poloniex to unfreeze my account?

You got me. I was clicking over and going back. Write a mystery novel about Satoshi.  We'll buy it.

You have to move your BTC off Coinbase ASAP.  If it stays you will not get the BCC coins. Bittrex and Kraken are supporting the BCC coin and will credit BTC to BCC 1:1.

My friends got their coins stuck in the Coinbase vault.  I avoid it!  Read the Coinbase complaints on the Reddit thread.  Your money and coins are not safe sitting on an exchange.  Download a wallet or get a hard wallet.
