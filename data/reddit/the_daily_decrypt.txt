That is becoming clearer and clearer. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:20:48
Yeah, Storj! :)

So much innovation happening when barriers to entry are low. Never a shortage of cool shit to report on.
@_date: 2015-12-20 15:26:28
You're welcome! :)

Pretty sure a journalist didn't break in to Craig Wright's house. Pretty sure that was some armed aggressors.
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:56:29
Fantastic! Thanks for saying so!
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:45:08
Featured this story on [today's episode of The Daily Decrypt]( Hope the money gets returned.

Yes, we had a SoundCloud channel earlier on. It was the ripped audio from all our videos. We stopped putting in the effort once we saw that we were only getting about 10% of the traction on Soundcloud that we were getting on YouTube. It didn't seem to be worth the extra time it took to do separate audio when it wasn't getting a lot of traction. But who knows, maybe now that we're getting more popular, it would be worth it? And thanks for the kind words. :)

You're welcome! Yes, was just logging in to Reddit to make sure that the commenters who'd requested it had seen the newly-available podcast at  Obviously you have. Cheers. :)
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:19:10
Really? Well that is great. If cryptocurrency doesn't spread love, among other things, what is the point? :)
@_date: 2015-12-08 01:38:13
Yeah, that was me!

Will Bitcoin be accepted in the Disco Melee merch store? Checked it out, but only see credit card support.

Hey, neat! Looks like a small trend -- this guy will donate $1 of BTC to the same Ronald McDonald house for every retweet he gets here:  (up to $250) Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2015-12-10 16:15:44
Hi! And thanks, glad to hear.
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:14:11
Fantastic. Thank you, kind viewer!
@_date: 2015-12-08 01:39:46
Hmm. Interesting suggestion. Would that be quite different from just pressing "play" on the video and looking away while you do something else? Would a SoundCloud account really be so different? Honest question -- and thanks so much in advance for your feedback.

Awesome to see this posted here.
Had a chance last evening to talk with Chris Pacia, developer at OpenBazaar (one of the perks of living in New Hampshire). He said that everything seems to be functioning on the UI except for payment confirmation on the part of the seller. Seller receives payment via the Bitcoin blockchain, of course, but apparently the throughput of shipping details or escrow confirm or whatever is still somewhat lacking.
Just a heads-up to any Debian (and apparently also MacOSX) users who decide to try it all out.

Ha ha, no trips scheduled to Berlin in near future, no. But I'll look up y'all crypto folk if that day comes! Thanks.
@_date: 2016-01-30 22:10:11
And pass it along, he did, and then some. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 19:22:30
Shit, that's amazing. I guess I didn't know that because I don't use Chrome, so I haven't been able to install it. Thank you for the info, looking more into it now.
@_date: 2016-01-29 04:40:04
Good question, I'd be keen to see someone take a shot at an answer.
@_date: 2016-01-30 22:09:16
Will do, buddy, thanks.
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:13:14
Thanks for posting here, OP. Cheers.
@_date: 2016-01-30 22:08:44
Hi! Thanks so much for your generous tip! :) :)
@_date: 2016-01-10 23:35:25
It was great to have a new guest on the show...
@_date: 2016-01-03 23:30:43
Yes, I think posting an address in the description section of all yours videos for ProTip users is best.
I'm keen for the first decentralized, user-controlled subscription app for cryptocurrency to come along. This would be so useful for recurring payments, memberships, that kind of thing. There was talk in BitShares, and it cleverly used account permissions and set withdrawal limits, but nothing materialized.
@_date: 2016-01-29 04:43:07
Thank you.
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:10:24
Are you shitting me? Link or it didn't happen.
@_date: 2016-01-13 01:25:24
Really? Wow, great to hear. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-03-17 17:29:11
Good attempt, anyway, OP. :)
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:16:19
Aw, they went and deleted their comment instead of being like, "Hey, thanks, bro, for helping me with my words." Ah, well. :)
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:12:14
Just in case the age of the Internet made you miss good ol'-fashioned infomercials. :)
@_date: 2016-02-10 20:27:35
You're welcome.
@_date: 2015-11-26 23:31:49
Yes, will do! Thanks, yo!
@_date: 2015-11-26 23:31:57
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-11-25 15:30:52
I've been looking for something to share with locals here in Acapulco. Thanks!
I think I'm even going to do a "man-on-the-street" episode for The Daily Decrypt next week, asking locals if they've heard of crypto and their experience with banks. Should be good. Thanks again and cheers.
@_date: 2015-11-26 23:31:23
While you make a good point, if the big banks and PayPal are following these kinds of orders from the feds, you can be sure as shit that Coinbase will eventually, too.
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:41:18
I don't understand this post. What donation link are people supposed to put in which comment? I thought they donated to causes on your website?
@_date: 2015-11-24 15:17:52


Laying the groundwork. Thank you. :)
@_date: 2015-11-24 15:18:45
Nice tip, thanks!
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:57:21
Oh! That makes sense. Thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2015-11-30 21:44:07
Hey -- we got an answer back on alternatives to this widget. There is one! Mycelium Gear. Learn more about it in the news report we just published:  Cheers.
@_date: 2015-11-26 23:32:28
Ah, good tips. Appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:56:18
We would also like to know a working alternative and put out your question on today's episode of The Daily Decrypt:  Hope some good stuff is found!
