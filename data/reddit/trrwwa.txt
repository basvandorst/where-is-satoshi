I can't remember the article, but someone wrote about attempting to understand a network as something that is constantly in flux. So the question is, why is the full node count dropping (relative to user) and how do we reverse that trend? I hope someone can pay the article as it's far more articulate than this post...

The merchant shouldn't accept RBF transactions in this case.. which is easy to do. 
Bitcoin struggles with time-sensitive purchases.. It's 10 minutes to the first confirmation.. L2 solutions are the only way to maintain decentralization and security and have fast tx's. Altcoins which claim faster speeds are **necessarily** sacrificing decentralization or security.

Like I said, I'm not going to argue the degree to which both Trump and Clinton supported this disgusting person, but in 2002 Trump was quoted as saying, "I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."
If you can read that direct quote from Trump and somehow conclude that Trump was not aware of Epstein and his proclivity for young women.. I'm not sure what to tell you, other than you are part of the problem, just on one side of it.
If Clinton flying on a plane with Epstein is bad, so is "knowing him for 15 years" and thinking he's a "terrific guy" and that its admirable that he "enjoys young women".
Trump banned Epstein in 2007 AFTER charges were filed against him. The mere fact that you are bringing this up in the way you did OOZES of your bias. I hope you can realize that...
Silly thought experiment. If you were providing me candy canes, after my mom told us both we couldn't have any candy, and then you get caught with candy canes so I ban you from my secret fort, does this make me innocent in any way? Or is it irrelevant to the evidence that I knew you had candy canes, and used to call you a terrific guy, for 15 years...
I don't care to argue this anymore.. I honestly don't know how to discuss this rationally with someone who things that Trump banning Epstein after charges were filed is any indication of innocence whatsoever..

Certainly. But, as other people have responded, Bitcoin does not need to hold every transaction for it to be widely adopted. It can be the base layer on which an enormous amount of other layers exist, from lightning and liquid, to custodial options and banks. Currently, this already exists on 'exchanges' who collectively keep track of millions of 'transactions' a second without any involvement of the main chain.


This is a common concern. I think its been addressed fairly adequately, though. As far as we know, security costs money. And, Bitcoin's security is actually not as inefficient as most people think:
 [ 


Some of your concerns are addressed by simply never re-using old addresses, which is the default behaviour of all modern wallets. Besides, that though, things like coinjoin and confidential transactions are being worked on.  Anonymity is partial at best (currently) but it is not an impossibility. It's probably only a few years off.
Thanks for the response!

Certainly I agree. But not all forks will be valued, and those which aren't wouldn't steal any market share. It's difficult to make a coin as valued as Bitcoin.. it would have to be quite a bit better to overcome the network effect and first mover advantage.. you could also argue that it would have to be different enough from BTC to create it's own value, before stealing any of BTCs, or else why would we need/value it? It may not be a zero sum game..
None of this though, "greatly undermines the scarcity of Bitcoin". It only effects it's demand.. so that's not really a fundamental problem with bitcoin or it's scarcity, but just a general truth applied to any good or business that's in a competitive market place.
I think for your argument to attract the proper response, you should give reasons that BTC is inferior to alternatives in such a way that it can't simply adopt the code which it lacks which the market place greatly values...
Or perhaps come up with an explanation as to how a better "store of value/scarce" coin could overtake BTC.

I've been here for quite some time and I've always pushed for DCA. However, today, I'd say lump sum through pro.coinbase and then immediately send the bitcoin to a trezor once your account is credited with them. 
DCA is certainly safer in most aspects, but I feel btc price is poised for more upward action in the short term. I could be horribly horribly wrong though... but I figured you were asking for opinions here, and the above is mine with all my biases left intact (like trezor being &gt;&gt; ledger, coinbase pro being a trusted exchange despite them having horrible community policies vis a vis s2x).

It's not a certainty, but I feel the ship has sailed for any competitive store of value coin. It would have to overcome such an enormous disadvantage. POS coins earning interest, coins with less inflation, etc. have all been tried, there's just seemingly no added value... It's going to be extremely difficult to catch up to bitcoin's ever growing market cap and demand by simply fiddling with the numbers (be it by giving out interest, or decreasing inflation, same effect really...).


I'm not convinced LN can't make up for these shortcomings. It has come a long way in a very short while and there's still so much that can be done to improve it. People generally seem to forget that there are, by orders of magnitudes, more developers working on bitcoin and bitcoin related services (lightning, liquid, etc) than all alt-coins combined. That is an enormous advantage. And, also, these shortcomings ARE inherent to all cryptocurrency, not just BTC. Faster and cheaper cryptos are necessarily more centralized and often less secure. Perhaps people are willing to accept centralized coins, but these coins most likely will not steal bitcoin's market share (based on store of value), but rather exist as payment rails in the larger cryptocurrency realm (with BTC as, at minimum, the fundamental store of value). 


It looks like regulators are poised to attack any big company attempting to push a crypto. There's a LOT of power to be had by maintaining a centralized coin. The government will not willingly let that go.. which brings me to one of the major advantages of BTC: no leader to sue, or imprison, or attack. BTC is not about harnessing the control of money for profit or greed or even good, its about freeing money from human control altogether. Whether it can do that, remains to be seen.
@_date: 2019-07-23 18:57:57
If the monopoly dollars are valued by the market, they can steal some of bitcoin's market share, but that wouldn't affect bitcoin's scarcity which is what you were stating.
Saying BTC may be outmaneuvered by another cryptocurrency is very very different than claiming forks of it affect its scarcity.

The conversation this started is just sad. People defending Trump or defending Clinton based on political party and arguing the "degree" to which both Trump and Clinton knew and supported this awful man. 
Unbiasedly, both Trump and Clinton sound like dirty politicians more concerned with their financial success and personal happiness than underprivileged children or the country they purportedly represent. America needs to break free from the two party system. It's creating a divide that is literally allowing good Americans to say "sure, our politician was good friends with the sex trafficker, but their politician was best friends" and honestly think that's ok. 
It's time to think outside the box just a little bit.

If the US economy was flooded by Monopoly Dollars (the pink, orange, etc pieces of paper) would the USD reduce in value? Probably not.. A really really bad counterfeit does not replace the original. And, due to the fact that BTC is digital and counterfeits (forks) are exceedingly easy to spot, BTC value and scarcity is thus not at all affected by forks..
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:56:53
Thanks! These are all fair concerns. I think people have already contributed to the conversation you started but I'll throw my 2 cents in.


I think this applies to a lot of currencies today, and isn't a 'bitcoin-specific' issue. It's, sadly, a humanity-specific issue... The USD, Ruble, Bolivar, etc. all require a working network and could be negatively affected by the scale of conflict which would affect BTC's network.


Very legitimate concern, though I used to worry about this far more than I do today. It was questionable at first whether mining pools would trend towards a single dominant player, or trend towards oligarchy. Today, the trend is very clearly the latter. Oligarchy may be a 'bad word' but in this context it is as good as it gets (and pool operators are at the mercy of all attentive miners within their pool, e.g. taking sides during the scaling debate caused increased or decreased membership).
 [ 
 [ 
It's not over yet, so, again, valid concern, but I'm optimistic. :)


An interesting concern.. Not one I've considered too closely. Off the top of my head, a doubling of price every 4 years (maintaining the current revenue for miners) is easily attainable in these early years (certainly has been the case). However, as fees become a larger part of the revenue stream prices do not need to continue increasing at the same rate and can even become flat or decrease! Also, as mining tech improves, the amount of mining power 'turned off' decreases relative to active hardware making a 51% more difficult. 
This is perhaps a bit hand-wavey, and I don't have any hard numbers to throw around, but my gut feel is that this concern is a very low probability attack.


Always, an interesting consideration. Besides the normal incentives (if you have that hash use it!) and the normal barriers (it takes A LOT of computing power/investment to 51% the network, even if it is halved) there's not much to argue with. Time will tell whether or not a nation state decides to attack BTC or use it to attack others (by adopting it).
Thanks for the conversation! Feel free to pick my rebuttal a part! Bitcoin is great, there are so many intricacies to it, not just in terms of code, but in terms of its socioeconomic relationships and variables.. Who knows whats actually going to happen...

I thought the whole scaling debate was basically: bitcoin should improve so long as we don't inhibit the ability of everyone to run full nodes. Creating custodial wallets/light wallets etc. aren't necessarily a bad thing, they make the onramping of people easier.. And so long as we are not jeopardizing the ability of people to run full nodes, that shouldn't matter...
I also don't think this 'incentivizes' people to run light wallets... that 'incentive' already exists. All it does is give them a good option to do so. Those incentives, that gap, will create a solution eventually. This sounds like a pretty decent solution.
This feels like a 'path of least resistance' problem, where you are, rightfully, saying that people should run full nodes despite the fact that a quicker solution exists (and always will exist whether in core or not). It would be great (maybe) if that path didn't exist, but it does and you can't stop people from following it.
That said, I'm very much OK with another implementation using it, I might even prefer it. I do hope, though, that that implementation doesn't takeover a larger proportion of nodes... And that concern causes me to wonder if it would be better in core, insomuch as it would actually alleviate the potential incentifying of light wallets/none core implementations and any confusion competing implementations bring with it.

I was responding to: "shit like that should just not be possible with a couple of built in commands and hit the enter key bye-bye 4 BTC". This is true of BTC, still to this day. We just don't see it because wallet tech has been around for long enough to catch stupid users. LN needs to catch up to this. And I'm not trying to be rude, all users are stupid sometimes, myself included.
This guy's actions, not him, were definitely stupid. His idea of restoring a backup was EXACTLY what the LN was designed to prevent... Again, not trying to be mean, we all make mistakes. We should just strive not to make them with 4 BTC on a beta network.

If you mistake the fee and amount, the lucky miner would get the BTC. This is verifiably true and occurred on several occasions.

Everyone is crapping on you here in immature ways (on the internet?? what a surprise) but the reality is you are actually fundamentally confused about market cap. The total market cap is not a linear indication of how much USD has been used to purchase BTC, its correlated, yes, but its nothing more than an extrapolated data point based on share price. Again, there is no useable information to determine how much money it would take to move the price a certain amount to be found in the market cap. To do so, you'd have to examine order books across the major exchanges.
There's no inherent reason why 5% at 1000, is harder than 5% at 100 purely based on market cap. You could argue that at 1000 there's a psychological barrier, or perhaps there are more "non true believers" as time moves on and the user base grows (which you have), but bringing up the market cap is irrelevant.

Fisher effect primarily states that "there will be a one-for-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to the expected inflation rate". (wiki) I think you meant to reference something else, something like the deflationary spiral issue.
Besides that, economics is a soft science, deflationary currencies have been used before, I'm not sure if there are any historical examples of a 'deflationary spiral'. (I'm going from memory here, citations needed)
I googled 'deflationary currencies' a few years back when I first heard about bitcoin and found some interesting reading. Sadly, now with the popularity of bitcoin these search results are full of 'here's why deflationary bitcoin will save us' or 'here's why deflationary bitcoin will destroy the economy'.
I (we) should probably dig a bit deeper into the literature before we decide deflationary currencies are 'good' or 'bad'. Or, we can just see what happens. :)

It's not at all how it really works. A 1 million dollar purchase doesn't raise the market cap by 1 million. It could raise it by nothing if someone is readily available to sell, or it could raise it by a billion if absolutely noone is ready to sell and the buyer is impatient.

People hate on Coinbase mostly for political reasons. Coinbase was on the wrong side of the scaling debate and has clearly engaged in irrefutable insider trading (nothing tying high level employees to it, but someone profited from knowledge only cb had). 
Besides that though, Coinbase has there shit together in terms of regulatory compliance and security. Out of all custodial wallets I would suggest them. However, I do not and would not suggest custodial wallets for significant amounts of money or for money you are not ok with losing. I have lost money on multiple exchanges. A lot of people in this space have. Lucky for me both times it was small amounts.. this isn't the case with a lot of people.

The thought experiment is thus: bitcoin blockspace is a valuable asset. That should be clear. It has multiple use cases that are unique and economically advantageous.
The next step is, if the supply of a valuable asset is increased, demand will be INDUCED.. Use cases will be made to use the valuable asset. This again, should be fairly easy to digest.
The nuance, which you are hinting at, is that some assets will not induce demand (non-full roads and alt-coins). These clearly have limited (value is not binary, as you suggest) value, and never enough to run out of supply. So a clarification to step two of the though experiment would be: Assets which are limited in supply or where the demand is equal to its supply (bitcoin blockspace) will induce demand when their supply is increased.
In this case, increasing blocksize does not relieve congestion permanently, but creates an atmosphere of EXPECTATION that blocks will never be allowed to be full. Use-cases will be built around blocks never getting full. The Bitcoin ecosystem and Bitcoin itself will continuously have to adapt to ensure blocks are never full. This is would require near impossible levels of planning, consensus, and foresight. All new use cases and their timing would have to be understood in advance. To complicate this, you probably aren't just planning to always extend the blocksize. As the block reward decreases it is imperative that people still feel the pressure of an almost full block, or tx fees will always be set at a minimum. Depending on the conditions at the time (blocksize, demand etc) the minimum fees could be too little to provide security. Moreover, increasing the blocksize WILL cause centralization. How much, again is dependent on the conditions of the time, but everyone would have to agree on what level of centralization is allowed or consensus will not be reached. It's an incredibly complex dynamic to manage.
We come to understand the limitations of Bitcoin and work now, while it is still young and manageable (hopefully), to perfect a system built on something that is far easier to plan for... blocks will be full.
Outside the argument detailed above, we should be TREMENDOUSLY happy that Bitcoin is on the path it is. The other path is EASY. And it is being taken by HUNDREDS of alt coins. If the easy path somehow preserves bitcoins decentralization, and the delicate equilbrium that exists between its decentralization and security and adoption; awesome! If not, though, at least we have 1 coin willing to TRY the hard path.
Truthfully, its my belief that people upset with Bitcoin Core are either disingenuous, shortsighted, or misinformed. When you sit back and say, we have teams working on all fronts, you should VALUE and appreciate each of them.

Roads that go nowhere are empty. Altcoins that have no demand are empty. If bitcoin blockspace is valuable (which it has to be if it to be successful) it will be full. Keep thinking.

Blockspace is valuable. If it isn't, bitcoin is dead. That is simple to understand... 
Your second paragraph is mostly nonsensical? I'm a big believer in the free market, but your applying the free market in the wrong way. The free market doesn't force Bob to produce blocks that are 28cm by 28cm by 28cm. The free market buys blocks from Alice who produces blocks at 1cm by 1 cm by 1cm. 
If you believe in the free market being rational, then you believe small blocks are 20x more valuable than big blocks...
@_date: 2019-04-11 02:24:36
Not at all. You clearly didn't comprehend the tweets in op, or the concept of induced demand. If blocksize is valuable, blocks will be full. That's how it works. No matter how many lanes of traffic a city opens up, people will crowd them. All it does is increase the amount of commuters or people with cars. Blocks in demand will be full. Altcoins are not full for the same reason Bitcoin wasn't (almost still isn't).. because they aren't in demand. Increasing the blocksize buys time, but pushes all economic incentive into businesses that thrive in empty blocks. That is not a long term solution, it's a runaway train. The responsible thing is to tackle the hard problems now.

As everyone is saying it is worth a read. I stayed and went through some of his other posts, his about me, and meandered through his Reddit posts. His writing style is unique and endearing, but a self assured arrogance is pervasive, though sometimes charming. He is an admitted contrarian, and his contributions to Haskell and other lesser known/used projects lead me to believe he more than likely has a tendency to root for an underdog and attack a victor. He is primed to wax poetic on the shortcomings of successes while boasting about the heroics of losers.
I think his thesis is a bit misguided. This isn't a case of there being better alternatives to bitcoin, this is the case of the pieces for bitcoin being invented, but not put together. We've got wheels and gears but no be car. He also glosses over the importance of decentralization and how it was the primary attractant for most early adopters. 
It would be a fun discussion, but ultimately bitcoin is better to certain people with certain use cases or wants in the same way Haskell, though elegant, is worse.

I run two lightning nodes. I have made three purchases with lightning in the past two weeks. My nodes have routed about 100 payments in the past 2 months (I'll be increasing their liquidity soon to hopefully increase that). I began investing in bitcoin in 2014. I am sitting on the opposite of a huge loss.
But back to the point... My post was meant to introduce you to the concept that technology doesn't advance over night. Using 'visa is bigger than the lightning network' as an argument against the lightning network is shortsighted. By your "reasoning" nothing new ever succeeds.

I was attempting to say the following: if a and b are equal he would be predisposed to favor whatever is less popular.
He is clearly a contrarian and has put a lot of effort into something that has only reaffirmed those beliefs.. which aren't always true. Sometimes the popular ideas are more "correct" and, while I'll admit this isn't a subject I've ever spent time researching, I imagine better technology normally succeeds. But It shouldn't be surprising that sometimes worse technology succeeds.
Going back to his original argument, I don't think he made a convincing argument for better alternatives. All of his examples were either pieces of the puzzle or lacking essential key elements.

There is no additional context to your point. The comment string goes as such:
alpr: "you can't use bitcoin today"
lul: "but you can use LN today"
you: "no you can't, visa is way bigger than LN"
me: "thats a silly argument of course it is"
you: "you don't know how LN works, you have lost money"
me: "i do know how LN works, i've made money, and its still a silly argument"
you: "you missed the context of my point, the other guy said you could use it EVERY DAY" (he actually said today but sure...)
also you: "you have no bg in tech!!"
also you: "i bet LN isn't even bigger than visa in 10 years!!!"
not you: addressing anything remotely related to my critique of your original point.

Thanks for this information. I'm running this on a University internet connection and they must be blocking this port? However, I have many other LN nodes connected to me, and hundreds of successful transactions at this point... so I am a bit baffled. Can you try it one more time for my sake?

No offense mate but you are looking at it from a very narrow view point.  It's not just "enlightening".

Apparently this is a minority opinion here but I somewhat agree with him. If the options are 'scale dangerously' or 'miss mainstream adoption' I'd go with scale dangerously. Having said that, there is obviously a balance somewhere somehow... I don't know what it is, but I trust core to bring us there. I hope they sit down and think about this opinion though, because its a worthwhile thought experiment.

I feel bad for Gavin. Everyone here acts like they could never be conned (FYI that's how most conmen want you to feel). Yes, Gavin made a lot of mistakes but if you are sitting in a room with someone who shows you proof with a fake electrum wallet you are probably going to react similarly. Conmen are good. And being in person with someone is a lot different than internet interaction.
I still believe Gavin is good. Maybe I am being naive, but who knows.

Libertarianism has nothing to dowith the removal of a class structure. It is about not impinging on the rights of others.  Political corruption will always occur regardless of currency, however, Libertarians like bitcoin because it stops those in power from controlling the money supply. Control of the money supply centralizes power very abruptly and gives government the ability to steal your wealth on a whim.

No agenda, no real information, I just find it odd that a couple weeks prior to this rally someone (or group, but clearly a very concentrated group that put up more volume in one hour than any other hour during this VERY large rally) bought nearly 100,000 BTC...

Why are we constantly pretending the price doesn't matter.  Of course it does as it indicates high demand for the technology. The supply rate is basically fixed (in the short term). High price means new users/new money .  New users is indicative of a healthy ecosystem.

It's not close. Not at all. The situations are wildly different.
I'm not making a strawman, I'm responding to a thread that was comparing the threat of a 51% attack in BCH to that in BTC...
To address the risk of a 51% attack in BTC directly. Am I worried? Constantly. But also not really. I believe in the economic forces at work in bitcoin. I believe miners are compelled to act in their best interest, which is the best interest of bitcoin in general. Do I think a single entity currently has enough hash for a 51% attack? No. I don't think its even as close as the numbers suggest (which again suggest \~36%, MAYBE 41% which is not 51%). Antpool is the default of the best selling miners available. I do not think its participants are loyal, just lazy.
Honestly, BTC hash distribution is looking more secure than it ever has been.

knowing that you are a person of some influence in this sphere, this belief of yours somewhat saddens me. crypto is supposed to be a disruptor, an end to financial corruption, manipulation, and control. but your belief isn't against corruption, its against corruption that YOU don't control.  which is sad.  so few people truly get it, and the types of people who do so rarely go on to influence others because they are the types of people who don't grasp at power or influence. 
I know you won't be able to see the truth in this. but I promise you, it is one that has repeated itself throughout history.

There are hundreds of forks just like bch... Do we have hundreds of real bitcoins? No, as has always been the case, the name Bitcoin is necessarily reserved for the chain with the most pow spent.
And the race between BTC and bch and all the other forks is constantly going, but there is no end so there is no need to reserve judgment. BTC is bitcoin, nothing else is, until some other fork spends more pow creating a longer chain. (Not necessarily longer, just more hash x length).
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:27:31
\~40-45% does not equal 51%. And you are making assumptions that investing partners will act in concert. And you are assuming there would be no response from individuals in those pools/other pools. We have to get 3 levels of "if's" down and we still are not at 51%. Do you see how this situation is incredibly different from BCH where \~9 pools control more hash rate than the total hash rate of BCH?

That's a loose application of the word "backs". Now, you are correct, but most people would agree that the word "backs"when discussing money normally applies to a hard asset, not a "policy". In many ways while what you're saying is correct, it's basically word play. The us dollar is "backed" by it's historical precedence/policy etc. but this is a roundabout way of saying "it is because it is". The us dollar is the world reserve because it's the world reserve. Nothing is keeping it there, nothing is "backing" it, Americans just hope their government and policies are successful at maintaining it's position and value.
Similarly, bitcoin is valued "because it is". And bitcoiners hope the developers and miners and crypto economy are successful at maintaining it's position and value.
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:11:05
That's because your math is wrong... this:


Is wrong. The proportional hash that BTC dot com has in btc compared to bch is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is total sha256 hash rate controlled by a single entity over total hash of the network. In this specific case BTC dot com controls roughly 10,000 PH/s (18% of BTC and 17% of BCH is \~9900 and \~300 respectively). The total hash rate of BTC is \~55,000 PH/s, BCH is 2,000 PH/s. 
10,000 over 55,000 is not equal or near 51%.
10,000 over 2,000 is OVER 51%.
Hence, BCH is vulnerable to a 51% attack at any time. BTC is not currently in that situation, though it has been close many years back. BTC is the most vigorously defended and robustly secure blockchain on the planet, and you are comparing it to one of the weakest (this is not a slight against BCH, just a fact which arises from sharing hash functions with the computationally strongest network on the planet).

I was strongly against theymos' actions but I believed he softened his stance towards the end of it all and became more tolerant of dissenting opinions. I think he is now (potentially) one of the best candidates having gone through this contentious debate and learning from it.  Remember,  his point of view was that Bitcoin was actively under attack by outside forces and everything he did was to protect it. His actions were over the top and in the end he only caused more blowback but I trust his intentions as I trust core. I will be more and more fearful as newer faces join in leadership roles. I prefer my centralization to be based on the shoulders of true cryptocurrency enthusiasts..
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:21:23
I'm copying some math from a response I made below. You are not analyzing the numbers correctly:
In this specific case BTC dot com controls roughly 10,000 PH/s (18% of BTC and 17% of BCH is \~9900 and \~300 respectively). The total hash rate of BTC is \~55,000 PH/s, BCH is 2,000 PH/s.
10,000 over 55,000 is not equal or near 51%. (BTC IS STRONG)
10,000 over 2,000 is OVER 51%. (BCH IS NOT)
No single entity has enough hash to attack BTC at the moment. There are about 9 pools that could successfully attack BCH... The threat level is not comparable, not at all. It's honestly not worth having a discussion about. BCH is tremendously vulnerable (a fact that arises from sharing hash function with BTC) whereas BTC is the most secure blockchain in existence. Full stop.

You might be hesitant to believe this... But these responses are correct. Noone knows. I think most people generally believe the price will continue to rise, on average, over long time frames. But on the way you could "lose" nearly half your value. I have been here for a while, and watched many people enter the game. Those who are committed to watching and holding patiently do well. Those who try to time the market do not. Just buy and hold, also do not get into alt coins. While some may have merit 99 out of 100 do not. And those that do are still ridiculously priced for what merit they have.

As someone else posted they are not confirmed on the blockchain as of yet. However, they are for all intents and purposes a confirmed payment as most people would think of it.

Still a little lost. UASF is a node that rejects all nonsegwit blocks at a specific time. Segwit 2x is a miner that will reject all blocks not "SIGNALING" for the original segwit, thus creating a false (maybe false isnt the right word but its what I'm going with) 95% activation of the original segwit... So the miner software isn't going to be from the core repository... but its activating the code originally written by core?

Slightly? It unequivocally would have failed. Segwit2x was by far the largest attack on BTC to date (this attack was classified as a hard fork, versus a re-org but same general thing, though re-org is a harder attack surface). A binance reorg attempt isn't even on the same order of magnitude..

Is everything on the internet false? Surely some is true.
Coinbase is not a crypto first company. They are company focused on crypto. By which I mean they do not adhere to any of the ethos which surrounds bitcoin and it's founding, but rather saw an opportunity for profit and got involved. There is nothing wrong with that at all. But there is nothing wrong with people advocating that others take their business elsewhere as well.

Because it was answered, you have provided no reason as to why it shouldn't have been fixed besides,"why fix what ain't broken" which is either disingenuous (because the other answers show why, it makes things better/easier like LN) or stupid (unless you can provide an advantage to transaction malleability).
Most of the time disingenuous or stupid people are trolls here. So people are assuming you are a troll.
