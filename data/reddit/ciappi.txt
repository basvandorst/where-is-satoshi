Probably because of "Bitcoin's Jesus" or "Bitcoin's Oracle" :D

They want the mempool to increase at the cost of minor profits. Because they are BCH followers they probably have bigger return by doing this. This attitude shows how much they are exposed with BCH. Wrong strategy by my opinion, BCH hasn't activates segwit and will not be able to compete soon with BTC.

Ruined? It hasn't touched the btc blockchain, it's just a "plugin" you are free to use or not. If you don't like don't use...why "ruined"? It's untouched!

The estonian voting system choice ("top guy in the party") has nothing to do with the technology itself used for voting. Your consideration looks more a politic issue rather than technology to me...

FIrst thing to do is to buy a hardware wallet and move them all in it and DESTROY this address.
If you have taken a picture with phone it could be have been uploaded in some third party backups.
Also don't try publiching an "oscurated partial picture"...you never know how evolved decryption is by time.
But please abandon imediately a local windows pc electrum instance.
For God spend 80$ for a trezor one and put everything there...and DO NOT get picture or anything digital of the seed!

Do you know how some people manage to add an image in the alias string? Looking at  I see many aliases with images of rocket, moon, lightning....how can I set one of this too?
Thank you

Only proven reference is this: 
Not users but addresses, including exchanges like binance and other "administrative" ones. Hard to prouve who the addresses are assigned to...and multiaddresses accounts are very common....

To be precise this link doesn't consider old dismissed nodes. I can still see the node I deleter more than 2 weeks ago.
The LN looks bigger tha it is, I suggest to remove all peers with "last update" older than 2 weeks....then you'll see the real LN....much less glorious than it is (but cool anyway ;))

Bcash already hard forked few days after HF from BTC, don't you remember? It did quickly to adjust the difficulty algho at every block because it couldn't compete with BTC.
The fact nobody remembers it's just because it HF unilateraly so quicly that the previous chain was completelly dismantled.

A picture taken on a phone...is on a phone? or is synced in a cloud? My concern is that picture can taken. Mobile phone security is generally very low that's why I would not recomend to take a picture of the seed.
