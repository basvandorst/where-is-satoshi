I had a similar problem, but destroyed just about all of my puny tools trying to bend the drive bay like you've done. I eventually found a much neater solution - turns out it's quite easy to remove the rivets that hold the case together ([guide]( Removed a few of them and the drive bay came right out! In future, it can be put back in with a few nuts and bolts.

I've been using britcoin.co.uk for weeks now and have no complaints whatsoever. Always been very fast and reliable for me.

I'd actually like to retract my recommendation after seeing [this]( post by genjix, Britcoin's operator. Not telling anyone else to stop using it, but personally I don't want to have anything to do with him any more. What he's advertising is most definitely **not** legal in the UK.

This is correct in the UK, unless the owner of the images/video is married or in a long-term relationship with the child depicted ([source]( - the meaning of "child" in all that legislation is under 18, unless otherwise mentioned.)

In case anyone is delusional enough to think that this is legal because it's just chat or something, the following experiment might be instructive:
1. Go into a phone box in one of the seedier parts of central London.
2. Count how many of the phone sex cards in there are for "18 year old" girls.
3. Count how many of the phone sex cards in there are for "16 year old" girls.
Your results will most likely be "a lot" and "none" respectively. You guys believe in the power of the market - if it was legal then the market would provide because God knows there's demand (unfortunately).
