Sure, there is almost always room for improvement with anything. But the existence of room for development does not imply a poor existing starting state.

Rather than address your points directly, I want to address the assumptions behind your points because I think that are illustrative of the larger problem of lopsided expectations placed on Core versus other stakeholders in the ecosystem (exchanges, miners, investors, wallet providers, merchants, startups, etc).
One assumption is that in addition to designing, creating and testing the software on a voluntary basis for free , Core should in addition on a voluntary basis in their own free time engage in marketing efforts to "sell" its "product". 
Another assumption is revealed in your language: "sell", "product", "customer". The assumption is that the expectations placed on Core should be equivalent to the same as those placed on a for-profit business.  Of course in the Core context, "sell" means "give away for free". "Product" means "software created without recompense on a volunteer basis". And "customer" doesn't have its usual meaning of "someone who buy a goods or services" but instead "someone who makes money or receives value from something they did not pay for".
One can agree or disagree with your points. My point here is to point out that there are huge double standards with the expectations places on Core versus other stakeholders. Quick - name me the expectations placed on other stakeholders in the ecosystem? You will quickly a very sparse space of low bars and double standards.
Speaking of "selling", "products", and "customers", there **are** actual businesses in this space (exchanges, wallets, miners, merchants, investors, etc) who do actually "sell" "products" to "customers". Yet where are the expectations for their obligations? They aren't there. Who is discussing that? No, just dump all of the expectations on individuals who donate their time for free and who are almost the only stakeholders who **don't** make money from their donation of time and expertise. 
These double standards are reflective of the larger and predominant industrial-age mentality of the non-technical Bitcoin community.

Yes, some have been vocal. There's a big difference between being vocal and being an effective communicator (though they are not mutually exclusive).  
If they have been effective communicators, why was it such a revelation (after a year of this issue) when Jihan shared that Weibo post a few days ago? In fact, the author of that post essentially admits that their communication has been obfuscated: 
"Blocking the fixing of a bug, on an emotional level as well as a logical one, is not appropriate. These miners know this in their hearts. That is why they do not bring the issue to attention and **are not willing to clearly articulate their position**" [emphasis mine]:

Bruce - I agree with the general sentiment behind what you're saying. Perhaps if I saw equivalent criticism of the non-technical side for its areas for development, the general criticism I see wouldn't bother me. But there's a large double standard in the expectations for other stakeholders.
Even your post with its reasonable tone contains a subtle implicit double standard... that the burden of responsibility should be on Core to meet the other stakeholders where they are and on their terms ("conferences, calls, meetings etc.") rather than the other way around ("IRC, the mailing list, GitHub etc"). I'm not arguing whether that is correct or incorrect, but I am asserting that the assumption behind it is that the Core team should be subordinate to those other stakeholders, and I am arguing that that assumption is incorrect.
At the very minimum, the responsibility to both communicate and understand should be equal. I could also construct a pretty good argument that the burden of responsibility should fall much more heavily on the for-profit stakeholders enabled by volunteers than it should fall on the volunteers. I'm not making that assertion now, but it would be easy to construct.
I go into these double standards on a different reply in this thread: 
In any case, I applaud your recent efforts to learn C++ (saw your tweet) and to help bridge the gap of understanding. More of that on all sides can only be helpful.

As much as I wish it were not true, code is often not enough, my friend. BU hasn't gotten to where it is because of code (as recent events have abundantly demonstrated). They've gotten there through marketing and air cover.

I agree with you that Roger Ver has been sensationally effective in moving toward his aims. I disagree with many of his tactics, but I can not deny that he has been very effective. He has done an excellent job of marketing and providing air cover for his technical team to advance.
i disagree with you about the community-building effectiveness of the technical leaders on the big blocker side. My opinion is that they'd be approximately nowhere without the air cover of Roger Ver.
 
But where are the Roger Ver(s) for Core? Nowhere. Somehow the expectation is that Core builds the software, tests it, markets it, defends themselves and gains ground without any air cover. Roger Ver and the big blocker developers help each other out and complement each others' efforts, and they have grown and been successful in that way. The help relationship between the non-technical community and Core largely flows one way from Core to the non-technical stakeholders.
I feel that Core has done an hugely admirable job with almost no advocacy or support. 
If people have been confused for so long about what Core was doing, I ask again: where were all of these Svengalis who spotted this gaping flaw that has existed for years and who stepped up during the time period? It's revisionist in my opinion. 
In fact I wrote a post on pretty much this exact topic: 
Along with you, I hope we are able to stick to a tech meritocracy. Honestly, I don't think there's much disagreement there. There may be disagreement about where merit lies, but that's what technical discussions are for. 
Unfortunately the arguments are really no longer about logic and reason, but more about persuading through emotion, politics, and marketing. That's where Roger Ver excels, and that's where Core could use help.

Sure, but I didn't mean the devs had to talk about the software development itself. Many of them are articulate about the properties of the system and what makes it attractive, interesting and valuable. More so than some of the hand-waving that I've seen from wagon-hitchers. There are often course also some non-developers who are compelling presenters.

Thank you for the transparency, Bruce. I don't quite understand though. Are you saying there is no relationship at all? Or that there is relationship, but not a financial one? If the latter, what is being exchanged? Advice in exchange for a title and a board seat, I assume? Thanks
Edit: Just saw your comments here 
Thank you for the information

Bitcoin and 'blockchain' films always seem to be short on developers and those actually creating it and very long on those hitching their wagons to it (like, say, the Tapscotts).

True enough, and a good reminder. Unfortunately the toll that it takes on the community directly and indirectly through (mainly) Reddit and Twitter is real enough, both for participants and non-participants.

Lol... Maybe we should call him "Meddling Greg" Maxwell

Ask the ones who have been saying that Core broke the agreement thereby breaking the the miners' trust.

It seems that literally any behavior could be justified as understandable by that reasoning as long as there was a financial benefit to the actor.  Bitcoin certainly shouldn't rely on morality for its defense, but I also don't see what's wrong with calling such behavior what it is rather than just quickly dismissing it as rational self-interest. It's irrelevant to system design though.
My beef however isn't so much with Jihan's behavior as with the double standards of many of his vocal supporters. That is the point I had attempted to make.

Some may have been on the payroll, but it seems to be there were also a lot of useful idiots that I'd be surprised were directly benefiting. But who knows - it's all speculation.  I haven't seen a lot of attempted damage control though - I don't think many have changed their position. Cognitive dissonance is a bitch to overcome.
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:22:13
That could explain much of Bruce's recent activity. I had assumed that it was just a case of 'not knowing what he doesn't know' while insisting on inserting himself into discussions. But that seems less likely now. He's likely either their ally or seen as a 'useful idiot'.
