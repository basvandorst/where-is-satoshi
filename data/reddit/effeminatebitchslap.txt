This concearn has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not his computer is connected to the internet.
Yes, you need to trust the software you use to generate your keys, but there are plenty of open source options that are *absolutely* secure.
But again, this has nothing to do with OP's question about a computer being on the internet.
As far as I can tell, you'd be safe.  The problem is how do you ensure that the computer will never be on the internet again?  I'd rather just play it safe and create my public/private key pairs on a bootable linux usb with a computer that has no hard drive.

Honestly, I don't know how secure this is, but you can always just roll it and directly record the digits as hex values.  For instance a 1-9 would litterally just be that value.  A 10 could represent 0.  11 = A, 12 = B, 13 = C, 14 = D, 15 = E and 16 = F.  Ignore rolls that are 17 or higher.
Technically this will create a hexedecimal string.  Once you record ~~32~~ 64 rolls, you'll have a 256bit hex private key.
Then you'd have to generate the public key from that private key.  I don't know the steps off the top of my head, but you can probably google it.

I see what you're saying and yes, you're right.
So I guess you can always just buy a 20 sided die and create your private key by rolling it a bunch of times.

[Found it](  You won't be able to do this with a pen and paper.  I mean technically you could, but that would be insane..
