Banks play an important role in the economy. Safekeeping money is just a part of it. A larger part is the credit it extends to people. By extending loans to people, it promotes the health, growth, and by extension, innovation.

Honestly, every market is manipulated by those with deep pockets. More so in unregulated markets like cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:43:46
Public/private keys are digital keys that are created using the public key cryptography. The idea behind it is that it is easy to calculate in one direction but impractical to calculate backwards. They are essentially “you” in the system. Private keys are randomly generated by your wallets and public keys are derived from your private keys. 
Public keys are used to receive payments and private keys are used to sign and authorise your outgoing payment transactions.
You will rarely see your key pairs. The receiving address that you give to others to send you coins are a fingerprint of your public key. Therefore addresses and keys are similar.

Yep that part I understand but what if you send your coin from you exchange wallet to another person’s wallet on the same exchange? Does it go through the chain or it is just another SQL database statement that transfer from one account to another?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:31:00
Well, one way could be buying btc or any commonly traded cryptos like eth, send it to another exchange through gdax to save on transaction fees, and then sell it for fiat at the other exchange. 
Why not just withdraw the fiat you deposit from coinbase though?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:17
Yep, FUD is another way to go but I’ve noticed that btc iOS fairly resistant to FUds. In fact, it seems to thrive on FUD. So I’m thinking if someone has deep pockets, it may just be easier to silently manipulate with buy and sell orders.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:23:35
Problem with that is that without regulations, you’d have people trying to exploit others by charging insane interest rates and both parties have no legal recourse in many situations. Without a 3rd party as witness, both debtor and creditor takes on a huge amount of risk. Banks in this case acts as the 3rd party. Even if it’s peer to peer, I believe that there will be a 3rd party that helps facilitate the transaction.

Many felt that the execution of introducing bch was not communicated properly and coincided with a few situations that makes it look suspicious so people are withdrawing support for coinbase. It’s like EA with Star Wars battlefront, players felt like their trust was betrays so they withdrew support which consequently contributed to the fall in EA share prices.
Nothing here is official though so it’s up to individuals to make their own decision. I simply moved on because better options opened up and if I can go somewhere that is cheaper and has no history of drama and scandals yet, the choice is simple.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:54:34
And the problem with cryptos is that a very small number of people hold very substantial share of the market, more so than in the other asset classes, which makes it even easier and probable for what you said to be true. The fact that it’s unregulated doesn’t help either

They don’t care about the people they hurt and may have potentially destroyed. All they care is to make it off richer.

Use a memory technique and keep coming back to it at intervals. And if you really want to store a written copy, a simple “encryption” you could try is to keep the seed words in 1 location but in a scrambled sequence and the key to the sequence in another secure location.
Seed words
1) food
2) bake
3) TOP
4) quirk
Sequence key
Or some other math function/number that you’d like.
Then all you need is just -2 from the seed words sequence (ie quirk becomes the second word and bake becomes the 12th word etc)

Transfer to gdax (login to gdax with your coinbase credentials then do an internal transfer from coinbase to gdax - free) and then move to an external wallet that you control the private keys (ie desktop wallet, mobile wallet or hardware wallet) for Cold Storage. Gdax absorbs the network fee.

The point was that if quantum computing evolves to a stage where it can reverse calculate the private keys from public keys, then the whole blockchain needs to have already evolved past that.

That’s my biggest problem with the whole thing. Initially I was supportive of having bigger blocks as an interim solution, which bch serves but after all the drama, I feel that they are doing it not to better the technology and adoption of blockchain but rather for themselves to be the the ONLY coin. They claim a war against governments and support decentralisation, but their actions make it seem like they want to be the one controlling it instead.

Oh no, doesn’t necessarily mean fomo are the ones selling. Fomo is only meant for people who bought in order to not miss out. Even though it has a negative connotation, fomo isn’t a bad thing in and of itself. However people who buy in recklessly without proper considerations are usually the weakest hands that are first to sell. 
Selling could also be due to many reasons, like limiting exposure to extreme volatility due to pending news like futures trading.

Fomo investors rushing in to buy in hopes of quick gain pushes price up. Profits and media coverage encourages more investors. Soon prices are too high for new investors and current ones realises that they are not making the quick insane profits as before. Opportunity costs sets in and some will choose to secure their profits. Selling encourages more selling. Soon prices will reach a level where people are willing to buy again and the price will be supported at that level. Soon, investors will start to flow in again, and prices will increase, albeit at a more reasonable rate.
And repeat.
Or it doesn’t survive the selling and everyone chooses to exit, crashing the market.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:20:46
I would have to agree, unfortunately. Yesterday was a high volume sellout so we have a high chance of staying in this range for a while or even falling a little more before we can recover.

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:26
If transactions are made off chain that definitely means they did a hard fork  and are handling transactions on their own chain, which presents a whole other set of problems. So I’m still thinking that the coins you buy are derivatives and you don’t actually own the coins. That’s why they don’t have the option of withdrawing the coins or spending it beyond sending it to other revolut users.
You may be right in that they may be trying to buy the coins to allow withdrawal and spending in future but I can see a lot of potential problems with getting there too because they essentially have to buy from an exchange simultaneously every time someone buys coins in the revolut system (assuming they can get it cheaper or at the same price as the person who bought it - which I doubt is possible all the time due to differences in supply and demand). As of now, the use is too limited and too many questions not answered. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:49:51
Exactly. Larger blocks is just a temporary fix and the most likely solution will still be an off chain one. Not a bad idea but bch supporters saying LN is a joke is quite ironic. When bch experiences the same growing pains. What then?

When all other cryptos are falling and only bch is rising, it’s clearly not sustainable and likely manipulation in progress. Because even if btc has scalability issues that bch supposedly “fixes” the technology behind other altcoins are just as strong, if not stronger.

@_date: 2017-12-21 12:47:51
That’s actually been brought up a few times and is a valid concern. All cryptos suffer from too much volatility that makes it impractical as a currency. Volatility will stabilise eventually but until then, you won’t see many merchants offering it as a form of payment, regardless of what coin we are talking about. 
Problem is that volatility is inevitable and unavoidable in the early adoption phase of any technology. Coupled with the fact that cryptos are generally deflationary and fiat is inflationary, volatility between these 2 pairs becomes more apparent 
Incidentally, this is also why steam stopped accepting payments in the form of btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:38:10

Not for this situation. They are taking on loans to buy btc on the premise that the capital gains from btc will cover the interest that they will incur on these loans. So they are essentially gambling with money they can’t afford to lose. They are weak hands that will not be able to suffer any drawdowns in their capital and will seek to liquidate/panic sell the moment the gains start to slow or show signs of reversal.
This is why corrections are healthy for any trending market to continue as it shakes out the weak hands and replaces them with strong ones who will carry the price and promote further healthy Long term growth

Honestly the best advice for investments in crypto is to put your money in the coin that has fundamentals that most appeals to you. That way, you will always have a reason to hold strong or to sell out if the fundamentals changes. It gives you a definite entry and exit plan and keeps you safe from FUD of any sort. 
Know what you are buying and love what you are buying.

Exactly my point! That’s why I felt that bch could have been a legitimate coin because it solves a problem that btc is facing from a technical standpoint, albeit in an unsustainable and inelegant way. It had legitimacy as a “hotfix” kind of thing that could grow and eventually bring in decent developers, maybe even from core to help develop better solutions. 
That is all gone now with the rubbish that was committed, all just for the sake of proving that “my coin is better than your coin” when in fact both coins could have helped one another to be the best for the good of everyone. 
The fact that the founder is willing to spend so much time, effort and money in a childish dick comparing game proves that bch is no longer a legitimate coin even, dare I say? A scam? 
They implemented a temporary solution to scalability and spend countless resources to call it the holy grail. When the increased blocksized is no longer large enough, what then? If they truly care about providing the world a better coin, They would have spent all that effort into hiring a team of Developers to find better solutions.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:44
That may be the case but these futures are cash settled so no actual btc are involved. Supply and demand of the coins remain the same. The manipulation will likely happen another way, if at all. 
For example, I buy a contract at 50% margin and at the same time I begin massive accumulation on the btc market. Others start fomo-ing and this pumps up the price. So now I am sitting on profits from my physical btc and my futures contract. Once I’ve accumulated enough, I close my Long position for a nice leveraged profit and open a short at 50% margin. Now I begin dumping all my physical coins and watch the panic selling happen and make a killing on the way down. Rinse. Repeat.
This is just a theory though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:28:53
Red across the board, even bch is back to the price it was yesterday, this is bad for the technology as a whole because it means lower investor confidence and adoption 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:00:31
I’d supposed it’s down to the reason they are in the game. If it’s for a quick profit, they can choose an arbitrary number that when triggered, signifies an exit regardless of their own sentiments. I started with a “holding” account because I was curious about it awhile back and just wanted to support the technology. When volatility increased, I started my second account to ride the waves, with profits usually funneling back to my holding account

I’ve used their service once and found it to be relatively painless so personally, I have no beef with them. While I do not support bch, mainly because of how it was marketed and the tactics behind it are less than scrupulous, I don’t blame coinbase for offering it, as Long as it’s done fairly. 
But like you’ve said, it’s not confirmed yet and I honestly hope it’s a false alarm. But I still remain sceptical until it’s proven otherwise and I understand why other might feel the same.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:16:13
From what I’ve heard, korea has strict anti money laundering laws which makes it difficult to move KRW out of the country so supply of btc becomes limited and they are willing to pay a premium for what little they can get. That and the country is really promoting btc. 
Also due to the difficulties mentioned above, arbitrage opportunities essentially becomes nil so the price can’t find an equilibrium between exchanges.

Not feasible today and not likely soon, if ever. Otherwise, the whole blockchain will be in trouble.  The whole idea is for it to be uncrackable. Quantum computers will probably be needed to brute force this and by that time, the protocol will need to adapt to make it uncrackable again.

Uninformed investors are the main targets of PnD so we can all definitely do something about it. 
Educate others on the possible risks, the differences in asset despite the confusingly similar sounding name, and the possible motives of the supporters. It may seem insignificant but it may just save someone from being a victim of pump and dump.
Sure call it whining if you will, I won’t refute that.  I’m an early enough (but not large enough) adopter and good enough at managing my portfolio risks that this will not burn me. Still, it ticks me off that a group of people actively tries to undermine the progress of a technology that has so much future benefits to society and tries to make a quick buck by stepping over others who may be in an vulnerable position.

Probably not a very opinion but I’m personally pro regulations (to a certain extend) and believe that cryptos and the government should not be enemies because they can benefit a lot from one another. 
Ability to operate unregulated is a feature of blockchain but it’s not necessarily a good feature to have fully because it opens the market to manipulations and government interventions which affects adoption, innovation and growth of the technology. 
So while transactions should be unregulated, for efficiency’s sake, if nothing else, regulations should exist at least at the market maker/exchange level to protect the technology and consumers.

Based on my limited understanding, all transactions are placed in a pool of unverified transactions and miners put them into blocks, with highest fees going in first. The miner also adds one transaction that pays him the reward and information from the previous block. Once a block is ready, the miner attempts to validate the block through proof-of-work by hashing the header of the block with a random number until it matches a predetermined pattern which means he solved the block and he proceeds to publish his results onto the blockchain to be verified by other miners. 
Each block takes about approx 10minutes to solve.

When you buy from an exchange, doesn’t it usually go into your exchange wallet though? Say you buy it from Coinbase and you want to send it to another user in Coinbase. I know that buying from Coinbase probably doesn’t go through the chain since it’s instantaneous. But never tried sending it to another user in coinbase from my wallet in coinbase before. 
Honestly, I don’t know much about the inner workings of exchanges since I usually immediately transfer the coins out. Just trying to work this out with logic.

I’m no expert but I believe a Ponzi scheme is one where older investors are paid by the newer investors and requires new recruits all the time to be sustainable. It doesn’t not provide any value of sorts. 
Btc and blockchain may sound similar but there are 3 major differences that makes it different than a Ponzi scheme, imo:
1) blockchain has inherent value, despite what critics comparing it to gold may say. It seeks to solve a real problem in a novel, efficient and effective way. Ponzi schemes usually offer things that have no value in and of itself. Even gold could have been a Ponzi scheme when it was first introduced. But gold’s value was that it was rare and it could be used as a store of value.
2) older investors do not profit directly from revenues generated by newer investors. All investors profit from the technology becoming more valuable. In this aspect, it’s very much the telephone. If you are the only one with it, it’s pretty useless. But as more people come onboard and uses it, your telephone becomes more valuable but you do not directly profit from it. If you choose to sell your phone and convert that “value” to fiat then sure, there is a monetary value attached to it. It is more obvious in the case of btc because we are measuring its value with a dollar value instead of a “usefulness” scale (or something else).
3) Ponzi schemes usually promise high ROI that sounds amazing but is unsustainable. BTC never promised any ROI. It is the media and other sources of information (eg friends and relatives) that are promising that for their own reasons/motives. 
At the end of the day, btc and many other technology/ideas that makes use of network effect is very similar to a Ponzi scheme because that’s the common phenomenon it “exploits”. All of them require aggressive user adoption to be successful. However Ponzi schemes require non stop growth or it will collapse. True innovations that solve a real world problem just needs to attain critical mass and it will be self sustaining.

No stupid questions so don’t worry. If you’re buying your coins on exchanges, I believe that the transfer to your exchange wallet is not done on the blockchain so it should be instant and should not incur a network fee. It’s only when you transfer out to another wallet. Some exchanges like absorbs that network fee too.

I too support the idea that multiple chains can and maybe should coexist. 
However even if coinbase is totally innocent of any shady under dealings, by their mistake they are guilty of abetting a coin that has a less than stellar history with a founder that has a less than stellar reputation, most recently evidence of colluding with cnbc. 
This comes at a time when speculative investments from non financially savvy individuals are through the roof. They may very well have taken someone’s who mortgaged their home to get in on the ride, or stolen money from the single mom who was trying to make ends meet.

So you’ve said in numerous replies now.
I personally didn’t ask for an unregulated market. I even said earlier in another post that regulation needs to to exist in some form. Just because the system can work anonymously and unregulated doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to just take it as gospel and run with it. 
But that’s besides the point I was trying to make here. The point is that the supporters of bch are not here as much for the noble purpose of providing a better blockchain technology, as much as they have been claiming to do, but more so for the profits. The noble purpose thing is just a lucky coincidence that they could market it around.

Yep that would be one of those things that might cause people to abandon the incumbent and flock to the newer and shiner tech. But once btc achieves critical mass, it’s might be more difficult for startups to knock it off unless the tech behind it is amazing or if core devs screws up big time. Very much like our current fiat system, everyone uses it and understands it that’s why it’s still around despite its many flaws.

@_date: 2017-11-23 00:24:02
I don’t believe there is or if it’s even possible without coding your own payment gateway. It’s like paying with credit card in a store, the transactions still have to be cleared by the bank. You will need the gateway to send the confirmation of payment so there is no way around that.
One workaround would be to use a direct payment instead of an external one. An internal gateway, customers do not leave your page unlike an external one where they are re-routed to the gateways’s page. Takes a bit more to Set it up and in some cases you’ll need to code it in but shouldn’t be too hard and customers will not know that their payments are being cleared by an external party. Check if your gateway has an API for that.

If they have large holdings in an asset, btc in this example, they can sell it all at once or in large volumes to cause prices to tumble. That’s why major shareholders in companies do not usually liquidate their holdings all at once.
At the same time, one can buy large amounts of an asset, in this case BCH, at all offer prices and this will increase the price. If done correctly, this will lure emotional investors to panic sell their btc, pushing prices down even further and buy bch, pumping the prices of it higher. At this point, the manipulators can either continue putting more resources into pumping bch to try and make it the new standard, or they could make a quick buck by selling their bch holdings to latecomers who have been lured in by the promise of a new paradise. 
Buying high and selling higher is usually easier than buying Low and selling high.
For Long term investments, put your money in the one with better fundamentals and accumulate on dips. Invest what you can afford to lose. If you’re looking to exit, trail the price and exit when it triggers. Trying to time the market hardly ever works without a healthy dose of luck involved.

Least safe: Web based wallets are susceptible to hacks, they may run off with your money, or you may be keylogged.
Relatively unsafe: desktop wallets. Susceptible to malware and keyloggers.
Relatively safe: paper wallet and desktop wallet that never connects to the internet. Difficult to move the coins around for use and susceptible to physical damage/loss.
Safest/most usable: hardware wallets from Trezor or ledger. Do a little googling and you’ll find a ton of articles about the benefits.

Yep it will likely have to be another “invention” because Blockchain’s main idea is a trustless system which makes it really hard to issue such trust based transactions. 
Even buying things with cryptos online now is a huge risk. With credit card, the risk was borne by the merchant due to possibility of charge backs, with cryptos the risk is now on the consumer as the merchant could deny receipt of payment and no authority will be able to force the merchant to do a refund.

What’s usually recommended, if you’re an investor (not trader), is to move bulk of your coins to Cold Storage and leave some in a desktop/web Wallet for use. And you’re right, in order to convert it to fiat it the easiest way is to sell it to an exchange which will require you to transfer it to said exchange which will act as a wallet as well.
If you’re a trader, you’re options are limited as you need to have it in the exchange as collateral for leverage. In that case, you will have to do your own due diligence and Ensure that you are not on a compromised device when trading.

I’m not sure if every exchange is the same but yea, some exchanges awarded equal amount of post hard fork coins as well to those who had btc in their wallet there. I heard Coinbase is only releasing bch to their users in January? Heaven knows what a mess that would create then. I wouldn’t be too concerned about it though if you are swing trading, what you are likely looking for is a coin with a strong trend and good volatility to make trading profitable. Waiting for a windfall from hard forks seems too unreliable to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:38:05

The problem is that the goal of btc (or any coin for that matter) is wider adoption so divisive actions, especially one trying to take over the name/identity makes it a lot harder and confusing for new comers to join. As for bch in particular, the reputations of the heads behind it and the recent price action reeks very much of foul play and with a name so closely related to the btc, it is just bringing further disrepute into the mess.

If you lose sleep over your paper losses, that means you have definitely over-invested. And from your situation, it seems like this is the case. I would say exit at the next comfortable price and reconsider your financial situation, your risk tolerance and how much you can afford to lose. Don’t buy into anything without proper research into the asset class and more importantly, into yourself.
No one will be able to give you a good enough price to exit because it could go either way. The only way you won’t regret your decision is one that you make on your own.

Market forces of supply and demand. Yep, a person with unlimited cash may manipulate the price to a certain degree. He may buy all available bitcoins, as much as he could get his hands on and that will increase demand which increases price. Or he may sell all his holdings at once with will increase supply and decrease price. This is pretty much what happens during a pump and dump, along with some other pump tactics.

Problem with trading is that you’ll never buy it at its lowest and never sell it at its highest. That’s why for a new participant, it’s always better to invest, as in buy and hold. In that way, short term volatility is a non issue if the fundamentals are strong. Sure, profits are lower but the risk is lower as well and you have more time to react.
One way to reduce your cost is to dollar average your purchases. Split your $1000 into 10 purchases of $100 so when prices are Low you get more and when prices are high we get lesser

@_date: 2017-11-12 10:43:49
But please don’t take what I’ve said as recommendations or suggestions to buy. While I personally believe that btc is stronger, there is still a very strong possibility that bch could take over as the new standard. If it’s a pump and dump, then that’s good for btc, but if the people behind bch are committed and keeps pumping, they could pump btc out of the picture.
Even if Bitcoin cash crash, the “attacks” on btc is proof that the network is vulnerable. So if nothing is done, btc can still plummet.
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:09:59
Are they willing to pay you a fee? If they are not then it might be better to teach them and let them do it themselves. When money is involved, things get unnecessarily complicated and you’ll have to draw up contracts. 
I have had many close and distant relations who approached me over the years with the same request. I’ll usually offer to teach them about investing first and say if they are still interested then we can discuss further. If they are not willing to learn, I’ll turn them down. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:10:04
I was having that same thought before too but I remember that there are divisions with their own name like satoshis, mbtc, etc. It could be adapted to be similar to what we have today (dollar, cents, dime, quarter, etc). It is definitely something that will need to and likely will be tackled in future as adoption grows but it shouldn’t be a very difficult task.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:36:20
I personally feel that keeping emotions in check and having a plan is even more important as a trader than an investor. Price fluctuations are fun and exciting to watch but it should affect the plan that was executed upon entry into a position. Unexpected movements, hopes and dreams should not be the reason you adjust your stop loss. Chasing prices and catching falling knives are good ways to burn through a trading account fast. But this is just my opinion and I definitrly don’t begrudge anyone who believes differently.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:21:22
Very classic new investor with insufficient training/experience mistakes. Unfortunately also very common and the target of scums that manipulate the market/media.

I’m personally going into btc because I like the fundamentals of it. But because of the price volatility (and the fact that I only have access to Coinbase and it’s restrictive limits T_T) I am spreading my purchases at certain price actions and limiting it to a small percentage of my portfolio as risk management.
I haven’t honestly done enough research into altcoins to be comfortable putting money into them yet though so I could be missing an opportunity there.

That is true only if he is the only seller. Others will likely follow which will allow him to buy back at a lower price. 
That said, it is unlikely that satoshi would destroy his legacy like that unless he means to make a quick buck and cash out.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:04:15
Honestly though, I think the smarter choice would be to hold it. Because it will keep the value of the coin high which in turn promotes adoption which increases the value further. Finally when adoption reaches critical mass, and the price becomes stable and unlikely to fall much, then I might start trickling my holdings back in circulation.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:10:49
As a start, make sure you’re buying your btc and not trading them on a margin. Some platforms have both and it may be confusing.
Next, as someone mentioned, invest with what you can afford to lose.
Third, keep emotions out of your investments. Treat it like a business and don’t buy just because someone says to buy and don’t sell just because the news and everyone around you says to sell. Do your own research, create a plan, and have the discipline to stick to your plan. 
Be responsible for your own actions. This ties in closely with point 3. This is important because it will reduce buyers remorse and Seller’s regret. Accept that you will never buy at the lowest and sell at the highest and that’s ok. Buy high, sell higher is a legitimate strategy.
Diversify. Btc, due to its volatility, should never be a major part of your portfolio. That should go to more stable investment instruments like real estate or stocks.
Finally, make use of your age and compound your profits. Roll majority of what you earn from investments and your job into more assets.
Good luck and I look forward to reading your biography when you become a self made billionaire!
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:06:47
Not just a generic statement like that. Be as specific as you can because the more specific you are, the more disciplined youll be to your plan. For example, if you invested because you liked the technology or the benefits highlighted in the white paper, write what was it specifically you liked and what you feel could be improved. 
If you invested based on potential profit, then write down at what price and what pattern prompted you to enter the trade and at what signals will you exit, since that is usually what profit driven investors are looking for. 
It acts like a trade journal and a reminder which serves to remove emotions from the investment decisions.

@_date: 2017-11-27 03:21:07
Agreed! For ever sell order at 10k, you have just as many buyers waiting at the dip so we likely won’t stay there very Long. Plus news of 10k will spread like wildfire, especially 1 or 2 days after 9k. This will bring in more investors to push us past 10k, making it the new support

Yes you can. A hardware wallet is just something that stores your private keys which is basically your identity in the blockchain. Therefore it simply signs any transactions that is made before broadcasting it.
You send it to an exchange prior to selling and yes you will need access to your hardware wallet. Think of it as your seal.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:13:12
Since btc is a social tool, it benefits from a network effect where adoption (and abandonment) is exponential. This also means that we have clueless consumers who have no idea what this is coming in to the picture. These consumers are usually weak holders and are usually the cause of bubbles “bursting”. But as more people become savvy about the technology,  we have less casuals and more investors who has strong holding power, which will lead to stronger rallies and shallower corrections.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:49:36
AFAIK, it’s not taxable until the profits are realised either as a currency exchange or when used to purchase goods and services.

I will still recommend a hardware wallet. The problem I can see with paper wallets is that is gets damaged and/or lost/stolen easily and it really is quite a hassle to create and maintain one that you can be sure is safe. Coindesk.com has a handy little tutorial about it if you’re interested. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:13:06
For casuals, the only chance of someone having many btc is if they had it and forgot about it. Big players are usually the ones who hold with a belief that will get them through Bears. Or they have huge pockets and could afford to throw money into something risky. Go big or go bust!
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:40:29
It will really depend on how widely btc is accepted. So far, it’s been doing really well and the skyrocketing prices are helping bring more attention to it. With ever increasing demand and very limited supply (accounting for all those that are lost forever), the upside can be unlimited. But again, there are tons of factors that could derail it.

You can find an exchange that does btc/eur pairs and send btc there. It won’t be free though. From network fee to exchange fees, might cost more than the interbank transfers.
Not sure if Coinbase or gdax does btc/eur pair, but I think they might. In that case, it might be cheaper that way
Edit: gdax does btc/eur pairs. So I think you can find your gdax account with Coinbase btc and sell it for eur there, which I heard is free

Depends on the exchange. Usually exchanges will buy or sell to and from their reserves first so that will be instantaneous but with higher fees. There are some that matches buyers to Sellers with much lower to sometimes no fees and they will earn from the spread, those will not be instant unless there is a waiting buyer / seller in the queue. 
There are others that allows trading on derivatives of a btc pair so the btc doesn’t even exist.

Isn’t gambling with the first bitcoin already realising the gains from it? So I’m thinking that if you bought 1 btc at 1,000 and gambled it at a value of 2,000 you would have already owed taxes for 1k. If you won another bitcoin worth 2,000 maybe it may be free from taxes until you sell it for a gain? I’m just guessing though.

We can never know, there may be another black swan event that causes the price to swing. If you look at the charts though, we still have not recovered from the correction so you may take that as a chance to accumulate as we hopefully move towards and break previous highs. Just always tell yourself that whatever money invested will be lost. That way, you will be more careful and deliberate before you buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:17:46
I would recommend asking a tax auditor or the governing body in your country for better answers. There will be many here and around you who will tell you not to declare but better to be safe than be in jail.

I fully agree that there is a place for other coins as well and being first may not always make you the best. Competition drives innovation and I’m all for that! That’s the reason why I’m partial to btc but also open to altcoins. 
However, bch’s actions have been too dodgy and even scammy for me to take them seriously. I don’t get the sense that they are seeking to be  to help the world, but rather they are just in it for the profit of the few and they are willing to screw everyone over, including their users to get there.

5 mine is common. 1 minute is too “noisy” and for something as volatile as cryptos, it’s not recommended. I personally use daily charts as the price is a little more stable. I use that for my Accumulation of coins too.

Correction, yes. Even possible now we might have Seller’s queueing at 9k  so we might have minor corrections. However the technology is still sound and these prices will likely bring greater news coverage which will increase adoption and push price further.
The thing about bitcoin which is unique is that a lot of investors are holders and believers in the technology. This acts to limit the steepness of any corrections. Usually.
As for bubble popping, it depends on the
Magnitude of differences between perceived benefits of btc/Blockchain and the actual benefits. Personally I believe the bubble will not pop at 10k but a little later because btc utility and adoption has not been fully realised yet and most of the fervour/retail investors have not reached it yet to create hysteria which will lead to insane price spikes followed by a burst to equilibrium

Definitely. I was a little luckier got in early and bought some when the price was at $300 or so and even had the fortune of being equipped with the knowledge of both btc and how to trade/invest and had the resources to do so. But the difficulty in accumulating at that time made me lazy and I didn’t get as much as I would have liked at that time.

10k is is psychological level, there will be a sell off.  How much of a sell off is debatable though. I personally believe correction will not be too deep. It could be the Super shallow one we had at 9k

I’d say that for it the crash and not recover, it will have to be something that causes a widespread abandonment of adoption. Other problems may cause a temporary fall in price but if the technology behind it is sound and it bring benefits to businesses and consumers, it will recover.

Setting a SL based on % is not ideal, you should set the SL at points that if price hits, invalidates your trade plan. Then you will invest how much loss you can take based on that SL.

Didn’t read the article but if what you said is a summary, I want what this author is smoking. Btc is not a company and therefore has no earnings therefore that invalidates the whole article.

Personally, I am staying away because of 3 reasons:
1) the people behind bch or pushing bch are a few and can easily be identified. I feel this is against the ethos of bitcoin as it should be anonymous and decentralised.
2) the identified people behind it has obvious self serving agendas for wanting to push bch and they have bad rep. This doesn’t sit well with me at all. I’m not against alt coins IF it tries to solve a problem or tries to be better for the community, not just a few people who will stand to profit.
3) Their “marketing” campaign is unscrupulous at best. Trying to sow confusion to trick new entrants, pump and dump (although not proven), trying to put themselves up on a pedestal by discrediting btc, etc.

It’s a sound investment advice that is being repeated by countless investors. It does not mean not caring about your investment. Far from it. It means caring so much about your money that you’ve gone out of your way to make a proper plan and having the discipline to stick to it. This includes knowing what you are getting into and knowing your limits. When you have a plan and you execute it, you take emotions out of the whole equation which is usually the cause of panic selling/buying. 
No one can tell you with 100% certainty where price will go. You have said so yourself that only hindsight will tell. I was only giving you advice on how to be a better investor/trader that can make your own decision based on the facts out there and not the opinions of others which will always have a 50% chance (price up or down) of being right and will serve to confuse you. But I Guess that is asinine. So good luck to you and no, you will not get my bitcoins.

That’s really odd.. money laundering is a serious crime. Not sure which country you are in but it doesn’t seem like a country that is looking out for its citizens. Or the government is high on drugs. If they are tracking your bank account very closely then there isn’t much you can do other than maybe getting a Foreigner Friend or relative you can trust to make another bank account and get them to sell it for you. You will need to deposit to the exchange via that Friend too.
You may also buy amazon gift cards with btc and sell it for cash.
No matter what option you choose, the fact that they classify it as a criminal activity means they are out to get anyone involved in it. This might not be such a good idea for you to get into. Good luck.

Coinbase is an option but like you’ve mentioned, high fees and restrictive limits makes it only a convenient choice for Low amounts. Localbitcoin doesn’t have limits but has pretty hefty fees too. I heard gdax is a better alternative for high volume trades but it’s not available in many countries. Maybe kraken? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:29:28
Try coinbase’s gdax for that. If you’re lucky, it will work in your region. My options are limited and my trading platform’s spreads are a lot crazier but my daily interest only starts on T+2 at 0.04% so I’ve been doing intraday trades while waiting for funds and verifications to clear some exchanges that I am trying out.

I think he will require a payment gateway for automatic payment processing though. Otherwise he’ll have to wait to receive the payment, check it, before sending the products.

Diversify is my advice. Put a small amount you are willing to lose into crypto of your choice and use a buy and hold strategy for it. The volatility of btc makes it a good instrument to trade too, depending on your risk tolerance. 
The problem I feel with btc is that it has no intrinsic value, unlike commodities. Fiat money has no intrinsic value too but it is widely adopted. Btc is going through growing pains and needs widespread adoption to continue growing. That’s why I personally wouldn’t risk everything into it. But I do believe in its potential (amongst other cryptos) so I am willing to hold some as a Long term investment.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:43:35
Looks like an article trying to cause panic against btc in favour of bch. Very little substance to contribute apart from basic math. /ignore
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:47:02
I went with Nano s simply because it’s cheaper. Also, I don’t really dig the shape of Trezor or its build quality (from the pictures) and keepkey is just bulky
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:41:39
If nobody is selling, prices will increase
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:11:42
It wouldn’t matter because you have essentially dollar averaged the cost of your btc. So each of your coin is now worth (10,000 + 5,000) / 2 = 7,500 CAD. So that will be the new value you should be working with when calculating profit/loss
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:25:21
There are a few costs to consider: network fees paid to miner to process your transaction (higher fees means higher priority in the queue) and your exchange may exact a withdrawal fee on you so you’ll have to check. 
If you are doing swing trading, it might be better to keep it on the exchange. It’s not recommended and probably not a popular recommendation but you need liquidity to trade and if you are stuck waiting in queue to send your coins, you may miss big moves. Last pump and dump/Attack on btc Blockchain slowed all transactions down so much that it was near impossible to trade with it.
So only get a ledger of you intend to hold some and leave the other coins (not too much) in the exchange to trade.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:09:50
If it’s just to the general bank employees for exposure then maybe something simple like brief introduction on what it is and how it works and the different types of cryptos apart from btc. Avoid going too technical or too deep as the employees probably won’t care much for it anyways. Maybe add in a section on where it lies in the whole system of economy so they have a general birds eye view of their place in the grand scheme of things. If it’s to bank employees who are seeking to get on board the crypto train then maybe add a topic on how cryptos may affect the bank and how the bank can prepare or harness it to their benefit.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:39:54
Based on the law of supply and demand, as more people are looking to buy btc, the demand for their fiat goes down and thus value goes down.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:06:27
It was bch wasn’t it? Based on law of supply and demand, and the current sentiments, I would think that the prices of bch will likely fall. Whether or not that translates to a rise in btc, highly possible but uncertain. Market isn’t always rational

Coinbase is good for a new entrant to test out as it’s quite user friendly as an exchange. However, do not rely on them Long term as their fees are quite expensive, especially when paying by credit card. There is quite a bit involved with bitcoin so I’d advise buying small amounts and getting used to setting up your exchange account, your wallet, and researching on a better exchange. One of the most recommended one would be gdax which is also owned by Coinbase.
As for the price, there will always be dips and rallies. It’s just the nature of the market. However, as btc is on an uptrend, I would recommend doing a dollar average and buying at prices that you are comfortable. You won’t be able to catch all the lowest and highest anyways and in the grand scheme of things, the overall appreciation usually far surpasses the nickel and dime you save from buying at a lower price. 
Funny thing about human emotion: we always regret not buying more at the bottom of a dip and not selling at the peak but ironically, when prices are falling, you’ll find yourself being afraid to commit at all. You’ll find yourself buying at ATH because you think it will rally further and is safe to accumulate.

To know if something is a scam, ask yourself how they are paying you the promised amount. Often times, Ponzi schemes and other scams offer very lofty promises (this is their business product after all) but if you dig a little, it is unsustainable.
Some questions to ask:
1) how does that company generate profits?
2) how much profit does the company generate? Is it enough to payout to all investors at the promised rate?
3) any track records?
4) Google the company. If it’s new, don’t trust it. If there are bad reviews, don’t trust it.
To put it in perspective, this company is paying you 25% a week, or 100% a month, or 1200% a year. A hedge fund pulling in 20% a year for their investors is considered to be having a very good year and above 30% is considered to have sold their souls to the devil. 
Granted, crypto’s volatility makes returns like these look like kids play but 1200% is a bit far fetched.

What you are saying are 2 quite different things though. Having a hardware wallet doesn’t make trading any easier if the exchanges you are using are down. What you might be looking for instead is a better exchange

You’re going have to provide more analysis than that. I posted a few days ago and I think that we might have range over the weekend. There may be a dip further than this but we have a fairly strong support at 7800 but unless we have whales dumping insane amounts, we shouldn’t drop too much.

Not irrational at all. After all, the safest place for your money is somewhere where thieves have little to no access to and exchanges/online wallets have had a terrible track record as a whole. I hardly trust the government with my money and I sure as heck trust some online company even less.

Agreed that the manipulators are the bad guys here but the blame here falls solely on you and the numerous mistakes you made. In life and especially in investing, you need to accept responsibility.
