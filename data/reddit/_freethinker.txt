@_date: 2017-12-20 14:28:07
I understand where you're coming from, and I was on increasing block-size to at least 2 MB camp like 6 months ago. I did a lot of research and watched videos and now from what I know I don't think its smart to increase block size at all. Increasing block-size will preclude a lot of people from running nodes and will centralize bitcoin a little more, and increasing block size will only increase the transactions capacity by twice as much; which is nothing. With exponential increase in bitcoin adoption the increase in blocksize also needs to be exponential, which is not a feasible solution.  
Now, if we increase number of transactions off-chain with a completely new protocol, then those increases can be exponential, LN is a great example because it literally can add exponentially greater number of transactions to the network. There will be other discoveries/inventions as well as we go along. But increasing block-size, even to 2MB is not justified at all. Decreasing block-size however, would be justified if it will enable more people top run a full-node.

@_date: 2017-12-02 00:12:12
Ok, are we assuming that most of the full-nodes have balances in them and are doing transactions? If that's the case, then I can see why the new nodes will be isolated. However, aren't coins increasingly being stored in hardware wallets which is node agnostic?


  
I think if this is the case, then this is a good point. However, how would anyone know who controls the nodes? I don't know if this is possible.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:29:57
Short sightedness. They fail to see that the fees are low because there's less transactions. They can only fit twice as much transactions, that's not revolutionary in any way.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:23:39
On the same boat here. I tried to play safe and diversify, cut down my crypto holdings to 50% of my total assets on beginning of 2017, but now it's like 85% of my total assets. That's because it grows so fast. I regret diversifying on beginning of 2017, but it felt like the right decision at that time. I would never cut down my crypto holdings to 50% again (lesson learned) but I would still liquidate 10-20% every now and then and diversify to other realms.

Well, understood. But shouldn't big projects like this be a little forward thinking? We have lighting on the way, and OB will have open channels with all the customers so the transaction cost will be pretty low. As of BCASH, the fee will only be low as long as they don't have enough transactions. Once they start getting more transactions, if ever, then they'll run into the same problem but only x months after.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:05:17
Well, I don't know if this does enough to explain why someone very rich cannot spawn thousands of nodes by themselves that run the fork that they want to succeed on. Am I missing something?
We have around 7000 nodes right now, and someone rich can easily afford 10000 nodes and run it with the new software upgrade and now they have the mining power and enough nodes to secure the blockchain.

We need both. We need the blockchain to be able to fit in more transactions in a single block. We also want to not send each and every transactions to the blockchain regardless of how many transactions it can handle.
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:12:22
Net block size is capped at 1 MB. These block-sizes (e.g. 2.26 MB) is the effective block size. This means 2.26 MB worth of transactions are fit into a 1 MB block, and this is achieved using batching. Batching is only feasible for segwit transactions.

"The service would allow customers to use a digital wallet and convert Bitcoin and other currencies into dollars that can be used to make purchases at Starbucks as well as other retailers." So, they're basically creating a wallet that can be used in several locations that will act as a buffer between Bitcoin and USD.

This is a great concept.  
"With the goTenna app, the user creates a bitcoin transaction on the app while offline. The app sends the transaction to the Txtenna app, delivering it to mesh nodes. The transaction then gets relayed to other goTenna devices, eventually reaching an Internet-connected node that also runs TxTenna, which passes it on to the bitcoin network."
This basically means that you can create transactions even when you're offline which is just fantastic. When enough devices have TxTenna installed, this can be revolutionary.

Correct. That's why we need Governments to control this, not private corporations. These resources are too sensitive to be owned by a small group of people, like water and air.  
Competition does drop the price *usually*, there might be some exceptions. Well they could, if they have smarter people working in there. They work backwards.

I really don't think you understand the working mechanism of Bitcoin under the hood. Bitcoin offers literally everything gold offers as an asset plus more.

Yes, bitcoin is in its infancy still... that's why it needs perspicacious investors who understand it well enough and believe in it to grow and prosper. I am one of them and I will be rewarded handsomely for my conviction when time comes.  
Government regulations is threat not just for bitcoin, it applies to gold as well. Gold has been confiscated, regulated, and what not in the past by multiple governments. Bitcoin, actually, is less susceptible to regulations because its hard to regulate it or outright ban it.  
Competing cryptocurrencies similar to Bitcoins is practically impossible at this point merely because of the logistics. Lighter currencies whose computing requirements aren't as intense (hence not secure enough to park huge amounts of money as in gold) can still come and go with several flavors, but something like Bitcoin will not and cannot. It's like you're saying the internet will move over to a new 'x' protocol that is so much better than the TCP/IP protocol that we use today. Yes, TCP/IP protocol sucks on hindsight and we can develop way better protocols on any aspect if we are starting today. That's theory. Practically, it's impossible to change the infrastructure of internet to accept this new protocol. It's practically impossible. Bitcoin has a similar advantage, with so much computations already invested in the blockchain, and 16 billion already invested in the market, and the ubiquity of infrastructure and bitcoins throughout the world... these advantages are unsurmountable for any new cryptocurrency that chooses to compete with Bitcoin. Cryptos like Monero, ETH, and LTC, etc... have their own place and they will succeed but they will never be Bitcoin; the gold standard of cryptocurrency.

Because the charts are constructed using close price of the candlestick bars. The bars are of bigger interval the longer the timespan you choose for your graph. If you want a more accurate price, select the shortest window of time... The longer time window will give a more smoother curve because the candlesticks are longer, for example a 30 day length graph probably uses 15 minutes candles, so you're not gonna get exact price.  
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:42:21
My biggest skepticism on Segwit and it's support sprouts from the censorship in the biggest and most significant bitcoin community, US doesn't censor talking about communism, but North Korea censors talking about liberty and freedom. If there's a censorship somewhere, there's a high possibility that someone is trying to hide something shady. I'll follow up this discussion with technical details on both approaches, again on both subreddits. I look forward to open, candid, and rational discussion.

You're looking at this from a different angle. Forget the price per Bitcoin, share prices rise because of value. Price doesn't matter. If Bitcoin is worth a 100 billion (or trillion) dollars market cap, nothing can stop it from reaching that valuation. Price per Bitcoin simply doesn't matter.

I have researched it and I personally want to see both bigger block size and Segwit like protocols on top of it.  
If a miner decides to create huuge block, will that still be compatible with other smaller blocks? Or, does everyone have to come on a consensus to what a block size shall be?
Regarding nodes, what percentage of nodes out there can download 1MB blocks, but won't be able to download, let's say, 8MB blocks? I run a full-node at home, and it won't matter to me unless the block size is super big like beyond 50MB's.
I wouldn't count the bug as an counterargument, there always will be bug in softwares which will be found and removed during Beta.  
I do not have a strong argument against Segwit. I do think Segwit is too complex to be implemented without thorough testing, and I don't see why it cannot be implemented on a blockchain with bigger blocks. BU and Segwit can be complementary, they are not necessarily rivals.
If BU is not peer reviewed, then review it. If 30% of miners out there are supporting it, then may be its about time that people who believe in bitcoin review the codes and see if there's any issues.

OKcoin, Huobi, etc have 0% fee, so high volume there is not unexpected. Hell, even if I have an automated algorithm running at OKC, 0% fee is great for algorithms and it causes massive volumes. But it's not the volume that actually pushes price up, it only causes ripples on the price. There still has to be an actual buying momentum for the price to surge, which can be less in volume but one-sided.

Some people like to think of bitcoin as panacea for all. It is not. It has its own market. There are tens of other altcoins that are better than bitcoin in their own niche. Bitcoin is still the superstar among all of them, but its is not a Mr. "know it all" and it can't be.
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:47:56
Let's say somebody shorted bitcoin when it hit $1050 (that means they sell bitcoin that they don't have at that price hoping to buy it back when the price falls down), then the price keeps rising instead of falling. This results in negative balance in their account because if they have to buy back bitcoins - that they did not have - that they sold when the price is $1150, they are losing a lot of money ($100 per bitcoin in this example). 
Everyone can only lose a certain amount of money (based on their margin requirements and their cash balance) before the exchange decides that they will close the short position (meaning buy the sold bitcoins back) before it goes higher and they lose even more money. This is called liquidation.
Short positions getting liquidated is good for bitcoin, and bad for the person who shorted.
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:10:44
Well, that's a good argument. You have some valid points there, I don't necessarily agree with all of them but they are valid arguments regardless. 
My point would be, bitcoin will be able to take at least half of gold's market cap. Like you said, gold has a tradition, industrial use, jewelry... and so on. Similarly, bitcoin has ability to move without borders in incredibly fast speeds, it's more reliable than caryying/shipping gold anywhere, it can be used as remittance (similar to gold's utility as being a jewelry), etc.
Theoretically, there's no reason for bitcoin to not take over gold's market cap + remittance market cap + debit cards market cap. But how long will it take, noone knows really. I won't claim it would be in 1 year, but I won't bet against it either.

I think your post is grounded but it has a couple of economic pitfalls that you overlooked.
First, For Bitcoin market cap to go from 1B to 200B doesn't mean that 50B money was injected into it, an amount as little as a couple of billions can achieve this. So, for Bitcoin to have a trillion dollar market-cap, we might just need injection of tens of billions of dollars.
Second, yes supply and demand matters; jeez that's literally the most fundamental of economics. Bitcoin is being consumed by the market in a constant net-rate (despite the ups and downs and tradings), otherwise Bitcoin will be worth 0, or 100, or 1000... Definitely not $7500. The average net rate of consumption will remain intact, but there'll be ups and downs depending on market sentiment. When the supply is categorically cut in half and the market demand in dollars continues to linger in the same vicinity, there's nowhere for price to go but up. This surge can fuel another speculative run as well and the surge will be even more pronounced. It'll eventually crash to another floor, higher than previous, but it's simply inevitable given the mechanics of free market economy.

I want to add that, it just can't be priced in, pricing it now is impossible and artificial. Pricing-in now assumes people who will have money to buy Bitcoin in 2021 have that money right now, which is not the case. This is why the average absorption of money in the market is a better measure because the market will still have that money-inflow and the supply won't be there to absorb all that money at the current-price.

The very reason we moved from grains, to gold, to fiat... will be the very reason we will move to Bitcoin. That's just the only possible scenario, because of its economic, social, and political implications.

@_date: 2017-11-06 21:33:45
Coinbase is implementing their own replay protection, so you would be fine. If you do transaction outside of exchanges that have implemented replay protection, then you need to make transaction on non-protected chain first, and then the protected chain second.

This. I have a ledger wallet and it's a breeze to set up, and super convenient.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:14:24
But it's at least a service without authority overseen by some government. Coinbase is overseen by US, Bitfinex is overseen by HongKong... why can't we make an open-source exchange that is overseen only by mathematics. A p2p exchange... isn't that a great idea?
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:34:51
It doesn't fucking matter. Let's say I'm unaware of the politics and just a normal bitcoin user and I send my bitcoins to another address after the fork on the bitcoin network. And, lets say 2x becomes the main network eventually, now I don't have my fucking bitcoins that I moved. 
Regardless of my political or philosophical affiliation, I just lost my coins. How fucked up and foolishly irresponsible is this? This is evil beyond reckoning.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:35:26
All forks share the same historical chain until the fork. So your coins are already in all the forks that have been created since you have held it.
1. Transfer your coins to another BTC address, to empty your current address.
2. Import this now empty old BTC address to a BCH wallet.
3. This will show your BCH equivalent to your BTC you had before the fork in this address. Since your transaction on step 1 happened on BTC Blockchain after the fork, BCH Blockchain doesn't know about it; so you'll still have your coins there.
4. Google for more details before doing Steps 1, 2, and 3.
5. Repeat Steps 2, 3, and 4 for all other Bitcoin forks.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:06:42
Larger blocksize means you need more bandwidth to run a full-node. The lesser the blocksize, the lesser the bandwidth requirements. A lot of people don't run full-node because of its bandwidth requirements, increasing blocksize will make things worse.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:48:48
Increasing the block size makes bitcoin more centralized by precluding people from running full nodes. This doesn't lead to cheaper transactions but the reverse. Software upgrades like Segwit and lightening will make transactions cheaper without the need to increase the Block size.

This comment gets it. Some people are just delusional and they think whatever life they have is accessible to everyone if they struggle and strive to better themselves. That's sadly not true, I understand everyone has their fair share of struggle in their life but some are much more and even unassailable when compared to others. I was fortunate enough to have been born into a stable family with decent resources, and I have worked hard and struggled hard to get where I am now. However, that is not accessible to everyone and I feel incredibly lucky to have that for me because of the chance of my birth. I care for others and I think society and economy does well when more people are part of it.

BCH wasn't much of an attack, it was a choice that was offered and you can take it or leave it. BCH had replay protection. However, segwit2X is outright deceptive and obnoxious.
@_date: 2019-12-02 05:49:46
You are partially correct. People only mine as long as it's barely profitable; if it's REALLY profitable, more people will start mining until it becomes barely profitable, AND if it's NOT profitable, miners will drop out until it becomes barely profitable for some and they still stick around. Basically, mining becomes more profitable when less people do it and less profitable when more people do it. 
This is very similar to any other stable economic system; if making bicycles is really profitable, then every entrepreneur will jump on it and if companies aren't making money selling bicycles, the least profitable one's will start shutting down. The difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin is the economic lever that Bitcoin protocol leverages to keep this economic incentive intact.

I just assumed it'd be clear for anyone living in a modern political landscape and intricate social and global order the importance, influence, and necessity of government. Some things that government already does with great efficacy that outweighs it's cost are: regulations to ensure safe practices (e g. pollution of rivers, air, and food supply), funding of infrastructure and projects that are not attractive for free market to delve on yet (e.g.construction and maintenance of highways, airports, pursuing research on diseases that are not attractive to private companies), ensuring capitalism doesn't lead to monopoly (e.g. antitrust laws, breaking of bug companies), creating and enforcing laws (e.g. making murder illegal, ensuring we have enough police force for each neighborhood), and many more. These are just few examples out of multitude responsibilities of the government. One can argue we're doing a very poor job at some, however that should be the impetus for making it better and more effective.
I can't write a book here, but there are multiple books and real-time examples available for what more can government do to be even more effective for anyone willing to understand the extent of the necessity of the government and it's ever more increasing role in a global society.

This would be the case if you have private keys to your address which you don't. There's a address heirarchy level that generates multiple address from same private keys. I don't understand how that works and how to retrieve them in another chain and/or wallet service, and I am pretty sure a lot of people don't either. This is how people can lose coins if they perform transaction on what might end up being the losing chain.

Government does have a role to a society, that is the sole reason government was created through evolution of numerous other social structures. We shouldn't throw money at programs that sounds good and feels good but don't actually have benefits, but we should totally "invest" in society through effective programs so that we can have a ever more collaborative economy where everyone contributes to it, rather than a sad chunk of population leeching off of it. My philosophy, as proposed in the book "Nudge" for the role of government is to act as a paternal figure while leaving much liberty to the society and individuals; the term is paternal libertarianism.  
As per your solution to make families stick together, government can act as a paternal figure to provide incentives to stick together rather than forcing people to do so. Many effective measures can be implemented in society that actually work and are economically sound without having to neither tank our economy nor neglecting members of our society. Yes, we will still have hit and miss legislation while we traverse these unchartered roads, but such is humanity and the evolution of our knowledge and wisdom.

The price cannot reflect the effect of non-existent money. Money becomes available over time and the money that will be available next year cannot already be factored in. It's true that most money that is available today may have been factored in to the price; however I cannot purchase Bitcoin now with money I'll have in the future. That's why steady demand will push the price up if supply goes down regardless of it being known in advance.

Hold on, i think you are a little confused here. Let's use Satoshi's coin for example. Yes, those coins will be vulnerable to attack but ONLY ON THE OLD DEPRECATED CHAIN. All the coins on Satoshi's address will still be available on the NEW QUANTUM RESISTANT CHAIN which will require new attack. Typical assumption is that deprecated chain coins will be worthless anyway since no-one will use it, so it doesn't matter if they get hacked. However, those coins will be transferred to the new chain which will still require the private keys for those wallets for them to be accessed on the new chain.  
CAVEAT: Well, I guess if the security protocol has to be changed such that the private keys will be required to be updated to be secure, then we will run into the scenario that you have outlined. Not sure what can be done if that ever happens.

I understand what you mean, and I am not going to tell you how to invest your money. I just wanted to clarify that I am not a trader but an investor. I invest in things I understand to the core and I believe will succeed. That's why I invested more than 100k in real estate, similarly I would invest in Bitcoins whatever amount I may desire.  
My goal here is not to convince you of either, but just letting you know I see it as a long-term investment and am not in for the rides and bubbles. Everyone should invest in things they understand comprehensively so that they can be sure that their money is safe and sound, and bonus points if they are helping the world be a better place.
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:53:45
Who's talking about trading? I'm talking about investing. I invest in bitcoin. I trade on securities I have partial knowledge of but I invest in securities and assets that I comprehensively understand. I understand bitcoin and its ramifications to an extent that I would never hesitate to put any amount of money on it. I support this technology and I will receive financial benefit as a return. I'm an investor, not a trader.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:25:29
Everything's value is determined by its utility. That's the fundamentals of any economics.  
* Bitcoin is the most secure form of transferring value that we have. Compare with USD/Euro.  
* Bitcoin is the most reliable, secure, and portable storage of value that we have. Compare with gold. 
* Bitcoin is faster, flexible, more versatile, and cheaper than any other form of payment system we have today. Compare with Visa/Mastercard.  
* Bitcoin has a massive first movers advantage - including name recognition, availability, and developments - that makes it a leader in cryptocurrencies, so no alt can ever take over Bitcoin in its domain.  
* Bitcoin has enormous potential for development which has barely been tapped on so far. No other current form of currency allows this.  
* Bitcoin is global instead of national. This is huge for economics since it's not affected by political boundaries.  
* Bitcoin is not inflationary like any national currency or gold. Noone can ever make more bitcoin than we are supposed to have. This makes it ideal for parking cash, unlike gold which is relatively a very fragile asset. 
This is the points I can think of off the top of my head. In Summary, Bitcoin is the shit! It's just that because of the esoteric nature of the technology behind it, it's hard for most people to grasp the true potential of bitcoin... just like internet in the last century.
EDIT: Added additional points.

There's one thing I don't understand about UASF! If we let the nodes vote on what path bitcoin is gonna take, isn't that easier for someone to manipulate than mining? Mining hardware and resources are expensive, and it's harder for a small group to own most of it compared to nodes. We only have like 6000 nodes today, someone can decide to buy a bunch of nuc's and place it throughout the network to manipulate the nodes voting! Am I missing something here?

You're technically correct. However, contextually, I was trying to allude to the fact that it has more web interface than a wallet with significant amount of money should. Everything regarding your wallet should be air-gapped except the transaction you are trying to send/receive. There's no point in storing large amount of money in any wallet that is not absolutely air-gapped. Proceed at your own risk.
