I agree that risk aversion is the major deciding factor when it comes to investing but cmon, government bonds are insanely low yield.
Almost any other instrument is a better value proposition compared to bonds at this point.

I agree that there are a few problems with bitcoin right now. But this is a new paradigm in finance. Bitcoin is not a currency in the traditional context, neither is it a commodity, nor a stock.
I believe that bitcoin is a new asset class, one that we have never seen before. 
And there will be problems while adopting new paradigms. To quote andreas, i bet the first time someone offered a gold certificate as a representation of the actual metal, people must have laughed at that person.
I believe the adoption will come once the volatility goes down. And the only way the volatility can be controlled is bitcoin is spread to enough people that a few whales can't dump and pump the market.

I completely agree that Bitcoin is legitimate and definitely has a place in the world's financial system. I have been putting my savings in it for more than 2 years now.
I am concerned about the exponential rise in value in this year, the number of uninformed investors and the general mania regarding the value of bitcoin. 
I know people who have taken out loans against their homes to buy in at 16500. That is not a healthy situation.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:47:05
That is a good idea. I should start sending this link to the people I know who have bought bitcoin recently.

Coinbase was adding 200,000 accounts a day in November. So the pool of people is not so small anymore.
I agree that the value is based on perception but the perception has some basis. For example, Tesla is considered to be overvalued currently based on their revenue and profits but the price can be justified because of the anticipated sales of the Model 3 and other technological advancements they are doing.
Bitcoin is as valuable as Apple today and I can't buy anything with it unless I change it back to dollars.
I would say the perception is a bit distorted at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:45:22
I am not saying that Bitcoin is not useful or valuable.
Bitcoin is an amazing technology and it solves some real problems with the current financial system. 
It is wildly overvalued at the moment and its price is not commensurate to its value.
Also, I was only comparing the hysteria around beanie babies to the current bitcoin hysteria. Not the actual entity.

There have been 5 major episodes of hyperinflation in the past century and have mostly been third world countries. And that seems like a very narrow scenario to me. What's the chance that Germany or the USA will have hyperinflation anytime soon?
Also, i doubt that the money in crypto is predominantly poor people trying to save their life savings from the government. The money is due to people from rich countries seeing a chance to double or triple their money in a short period of time.
I agree with the stock market point.

Lightning network will make transactions faster, yes. I am hoping that it will lead to a higher adoption of btc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:34:43
You're right that bitcoin is wildly overvalued at this point and I'm frankly worried about a possible 90-95% drop in value in the short term. It has happened before with Bitcoin and its foolish to think it won't happen again.
But I believe that network effects all but ensure that the price of Bitcoin will return to these levels in the future. No one really knows whether the true value of Bitcoin is $0 or $1 million. I feel that breaching a new milestone is also breaching a psychological barrier about the value of Bitcoin.
Anyway, my strategy is to invest a part of my savings into Bitcoin and not feel bad even if I lose all of it. I will have the satisfaction of having contributed to this mania in some way :-)
Stay strong and HODL!

My worry stems from the CME Bitcoin futures launch coupled with mass panic if it falls beyond a certain threshold.
I have been buying since early 2015 and we have seen a couple of 40-60% corrections in the past 2 years. 
Maybe 95% is a bit much, but a correction cannot be ruled out.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:43:59
Lol :-)
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:01:02
I did say that its not the best comparison but yeah, by all means, disregard everything else I said :-)

Underlying value means something only if everyone in the world believes that the value exists.
For example, Gold is considered safe because it has underlying value of the rare metal. But, it's only valuable because everyone in the world agrees that Gold is valuable. Tomorrow if we hypothetically found 10000x the gold we currently have on earth, its price would plummet because it would become less "valuable".
Also, if collectively the world starts believing that aluminium is more precious than gold and started making ornaments and shit out of it, aluminium would shoot up in price.
I hope I'm able to make my point.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:22:22
The "mean" in my opinion would be a slow and steady growth that we can attribute to some increase in real world use of bitcoin.
For example, if tomorrow amazon were to allow payments through bitcoin all over the world, that would be a huge real world value addition and the price would go up accordingly. I know i am being too idealistic here but I am fine with some speculation leading to a higher price.
What I am not fine with is a 20x growth in market cap with very little accompanying real world value addition.
People say that widespread adoption is a value addition but the fact is if you lose your life savings in some investment scheme, you never touch it again. So, a crash now would mean bitcoin would be blacklisted in a lot of people's minds and defeat the original purpose of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:32:25
I can't say what anyone else should do, but what I am doing is talking people around me and sharing Andreas' videos on bitcoin. 
People should know what they are getting into and then make an informed decision of whether they want in or not.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:15:18
The market cap of bitcoin has risen more than 20x in less than 11 months and more than 3x in one month. The value or usability of bitcoin has not increased 20x.
People often compare bitcoin to the computer with regards to how it revolutionized our lives. But apple and microsoft were founded in the 1970s and got super valuable only in the 1990s after their products had proven to be of value.
Bitcoin currently has a market cap almost equal to amazon and apple with very little real world value (in terms of widespread acceptance, stability of value like gold).
The correction this time is going to long and painful.

"I absolutely get the concepts around all of this - and buy into it. Distributed, decentralised ledgers. Digital currencies that  resolve the double-spend problem. The risks and history of fiat currencies, central banks and private banks’ actions and interests, and the notion of having full security over my own money, etc."
From what I am seeing around me, 99% of new buyers can't even spell decentralised ledgers. When I say understanding of bitcoin, I don't necessarily mean the actual mathematics behind it or the cryptographic algorithms keeping everything working. I am talking about the exact thing you have mentioned in your comment.
I would not classify you as an uninformed investor.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:38:37
I believe in the technology too. I have been buying for two years.
I am not trying to convince people that bitcoin is not worth it. It absolutely is great.
I am just worried that common people will be losing their life savings because of the mania and I don't think this mania is good for bitcoin in the long run.
If there is a crash now like during Mt. Gox (Maybe for another reason), bitcoin might not be able to reach widespread adoption because of all the publicity it will get.
A relatively slow but stable growth in the value of bitcoin would have been much better than the $4000 swings we were seeing few days ago.

If you check the transaction on the blockchain, you'll be able to check the address you sent the btc to. If the address is correct, sit back and relax. The btc will arrive when the whole transaction gets confirmed. If you fucked up the address, then panic.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:35:01
Please please don't process the transaction unless you are 100% sure the address is correct. Lost a few thousand satoshis that way in the past. Always copy and paste the btc address while transferring. Also, transfer a small amount, say 0.001 btc first to check if everything works fine.

I believe that the usability has to be the value of any product or commodity or entity.
If the value of Bitcoin is the price, it will never have any real world use because the value will always keep going up and no one will be willing to buy or sell anything using it.

The value of Ferrari is high because investors anticpate that once the car is rolled out to the public, Ferrari will earn money that will pay dividends to the investors or will justify the stock price.
Speculation is not bad when there's legitimate cause. 
If tomorrow, I were to start a car company and you learned that it has a market cap equal to Ferrari, would you be bullish or would you be skeptical?
Sure, the company could theoretically eclipse Ferrari in the future. But its value shouldn't be that high today.

I am still optimistic about the future of bitcoin and its place in the financial system. I am worried about lots of people losing their life savings because they got caught up in the dreams of getting 2x or 5x returns in short term.
I am thinking about how I can educate the people around me to invest wisely.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:35:35
I am optimistic that bitcoin is here to stay in the long term. My problem is with the skyrocketing price with no backing.
When it crashes, common people are going to lose millions who are in the hopes gaining a small fortune, maybe creating a college fund for their kids, saving for retirement or finally quitting that job.
That's what I can see around me.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:39:04
Completely agree. Bitcoin in of itself is amazing and has the potential to change the world for the better. But we are not there yet and the value of bitcoin is already equal to the market cap of amazon and apple.
On 07th December, bitcoin went from 12000 to 16000 in one day. It rose briefly to 19800 on GDAX in a matter of 10 minutes.
How is this not wild speculation and a classic bubble?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:19:08
I guess you were born with intricate knowledge of the workings of the blockchain and bitcoin.
