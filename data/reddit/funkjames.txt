In settings, security, you can add a temporary recovery phase which acts as a 25th seed, giving a completely different wallet.  This is how you can secure loss from theft or loss of the seed.  Be careful though, forget the 25th seed and it’s game over

Have been trying for the last five days to get Bitcoin withdrawn from Kraken.  Would get so far through and then would hit the cloudflare warning.  Each time, you're almost back to the start ( as the reload fails with a warning suggesting that you can't navigate direct to these urls, so you need to click elsewhere first; then go back, if you can... )
Sometimes you'd get lucky, and would get to the withdraw page only to find service is not available (which according to some is the hot wallets being depleted).
Managed to get a lucky strike where I got all of the clicks aligned today and was able to withdraw.
Perseverance might work for those of you giving up hope...

I managed to get the Ethereum off that I had on there also but I ended up going with a different approach.  
Keep trying until you are logged in, then, rather than trying to click through manually, right click the target that you are aiming for and click open in new tab, but instead of opening just one tab, do this a number of times (i.e. 20 tabs), let them load or fail, the ones that fail, discard, the ones that open, look through to see if they got you to where you wanted to be.  Then, repeat.  The withdrawal bit where you click Bitcoin or ethereum doesn't always like being opened in a new tab so instead. Try and open multiple copies of the withdraw landing page and then, use them to manually click through to the specific crypto withdrawal.
If you get that far you may not be homeward dry.  I got through to the end bit a few times but the hot wallets were depleted or at least seemed to be, however I just kept trying and after a few times it allowed me to withdraw (either they had topped up the hot wallet or there's some kind of limiter taking place).
Good luck, let me know if you have success with the above.

@_date: 2017-12-15 07:48:40
Brilliant!  For all those struggling as was I, make use of the open in new tabs browser option and open multiple tabs to each section that you're trying to navigate too.  Discard the cloudflare failure ones ... 
I tried for 5 days manually clicking through, I did eventually get a withdrawal.  
However, using the approach I just mentioned, was able to get the last of what I had on Kraken in a couple of hours.

A 24 word seed on its own, as used by both the ledger and Trezor is good in that it will allow you to recover the wallet in the result of loss or breakage of the hardware wallet, providing you have the seed.
The downside to this though, if anyone else was to get your word list, they could technically recover your wallet and steal your funds.
The 25th word, one that is just in your head and not written down prevents this, as they also need the 25th words to successfully get access to your wallet.  So it provides additional security.  If an incorrect 25th seed is used, it will result in a completely different wallet.  Some people use this so that they can have multiple wallets under one seed (I.e. a different passphrase for each wallet that they use).  
There’s also the plausibility aspect, protecting from the $5 wrench attack where you put a small amount of funds under a separate passphrase so that if you were ever attacked or forced to give up your coin, you could give that passphrase rather than an another.
With regards to cold storage, there’s many ways of looking at this.  You could do it with a hardware wallet where you create and store the seed(s), store your funds and then hide away or wipe the hardware wallet.  You know you can get back to it with the use of the correct seeds.  Essentially it’s cold because you’re not leaving it available for access like a pc client wallet.  
Some people use paper wallets for cold storage,.  Personally I think a hardware wallet with seeds is a better option but this is pure perspective, others will disagree.  With a hardware wallet the private key should never leave the device making it a good option.
If you do go down the route of using the 25th seed, I recommend that you always, initialise your seeds to multiple copies (don’t just use the one piece of paper, make other copies ... I’ve known people lose or damage their seed list).  Check the receiving address that you get when using a 25th seed and without using a seed, wipe the device, recover from the seed list, verify that the receiving address for both with and without the 25th passphrase matches what you had before, then start using the wallet.  
This way you’ve ensured that in the event of loss you can always get back to where you were.  Another thing you might want to do, is write the firmware version of the device on the seed sheet (at time of initialisation).  If something does change in the future, even though it shouldn’t, you know the exact version of firmware in which it was created which may help with any support requests.

@_date: 2017-02-15 08:34:18
Be careful about keeping the two entities in close proximity.  Think theft or fire.  If you feel like any loss of your coins would have an impact; then hardware wallet is the way to go.  I recommend Trezor with pin and 25th seed, then store your seed in a safe place away from the Trezor.

Don't panic
However, you should act as soon as you can, in the wrong hands this could be bad news.
On your phone, install a decent mnemonic wallet, Copay is good.  Create a new wallet in Copay, save the seed and keep it safe.
From your Trezor, send the funds to your Copay wallet.  Use the priority fee option and then wait for it to be confirmed on the blockchain.
Once your happy the funds are safe ( multiple confirmations ), reset your Trezor and reinitialise the seed, use the 25th seed option and save copies of the 24 word seed in a few safe places.  
Then move the funds back from the Copay wallet to the Trezor.
Good luck.

Going back to my original question though.  
If you had a 25th seed, and you weren't on 1.5.2, you would still be safe from fund theft, even with the exploit detailed in medium post.  Correct?
The 25th seed as far as I'm aware is never ever kept on the device.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:10:39
Thanks and yep, I have upgraded my devices.  Was highlighting this to cover off the doom and gloom that is portrayed in the article.  
If people take the time to use Trezor to its maximum in terms of security, then they are safe against these unknown attack vectors for seed leakage.

Whilst the app may not natively have this functionality, is there anyway of doing the same thing?  I.e. switching a configuration directory before the program is executed?
@_date: 2015-04-13 09:04:58
I've looked into the same problem from both a Bitcoin and a digital assets perspective and the solution I recommend is to leverage securesafe.com as the missing component for 'access' to your assets.
Securesafe is a company much like Lastpass based in Switzerland, however one of the aspects they offer is information inheritance.  Within your account you can assign individuals as an inheritor to certain documents or passwords.
In the event of your death, the holder can activate the inheritance process and during that time, you will receive emails ( or other means of communication, depending on your subscription ) to contend your death.
If your death is not contended, the individual(s) will get access to the corresponding information that you assigned after a configurable period.
I personally like this approach as it allows me to keep my assets secure but provide enough information for my family to access my resources accordingly.
Using Bitcoin as an example, lets say that you have a BIP38 paper wallet that is accessible by yourself and your trusted person ( i.e. you have arranged ahead of time that your wallet is stored in your filing cabinet ) .
In securesafe, you can store BIP38 passphrase, assigning your trusted person as an inheritor.  You could also create and assign an associated document with instructions that can be leveraged ( in the case of a paper wallet, you might want to include considerations like sweeping the whole wallet or advising them to seek out help from a certain trusted friend ).
This kind of solution can become very effective when it's combined with other solutions.  For example, Lastpass + Yubikey + SecureSafe.   Providing the person you've designated has access and knowledge of LastPass and Yubikey, you could save your Lastpass phrase in securesafe, setup inheritance and should the worse happen, the person in question can take care of any digital matters accordingly.
Good luck and I hope for us all, if it does happen then that someone will be prosperous :-)

Did you actually read the GitHub comments or just the Reddit title?, read the comments in the issue, there's no point me copying and pasting each time ... ��
The argument is in that issue tracker, as to why the codebase should be making reference to BIP91 and not Segwit2x 'under particular circumstances'.  I agree with it, it's that simple.  I also think the feedback was constructive but, the case has been closed anyway (Todd was trolling ... allegedly)..
If you don't agree with it, maybe you should put your argument to the main thread, sure lots of people would love a debate on this.

First things, keep the laptop in question offline for now.  Locate the wallet.dat file and copy it to an external drive.  I'd power off the laptop after use.
Then, if you have a better computer, assuming you do as this one has been offline for a long time, on that computer, install Bitcoin core wallet and let it do what it needs to do to fully sync up to the network.  This could take days depending on your connection.
Whilst that is underway, I would do a thorough check of your computer.  If you haven't got a decent antivirus, get AVG free, install and do a full scan/clean.  I would also get Spybot search and destroy and again, do a full clean.
After Bitcoin core wallet has synced, with your computer offline, close it down, then using a copy of your wallet.dat, replace it with the copy from your USB key.  Then, when you start up Bitcoin core it will start with your previous wallet.  You should be able to see a balance.  At this point, I would encrypt the wallet through the menu before taking the computer back online.
Good luck.  Be lucky.
