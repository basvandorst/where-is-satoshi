I don't break the rules at work. Checking personal email is perfectly acceptable by policy. 
I also don't go around like some sort of beggar with a tip jar trying to get extra cash at work for a job that isn't a tip worthy job. I would get fired for that as should uber drivers. It tarnishes the service to put begging jars in uber cars. Uber is billed as "no need to have cash" service.
The practice of tipping needs to die. It is an archaic practice and has no place in modern society especially for "new" digital age services such as uber.

Hopefully the long term effects is it will help influence tipping culture to go away entirely.
Tipping is a stupid antiquated practice that needs to die. Pay people a reasonable wage, charge more to compensate and leave me out of paying your employees directly.
It is just a hassle for me to calculate 20% after each meal. It would be nicer if I could just swipe the card and go!!!

I don't pick uber due to price (company pays most of the time) I pick it due to superior service.

If I ever see this shit in an uber car I will report them hopefully removing them from the service.
Uber is a tip free service and I want to keep it that way.

The service prohibits tipping. If I have to hassle with tipping to use uber I might as well use a cab. Part of the charm of uber is just getting out of the car when I  am done.
And if they build it into the app it just becomes a mandatory anti consumer 20% price increase.

Fixed, thank you!

No, don't get that tip crap started on Uber. Tips are bullshit and a new service like uber shouldn't have them.
Pay should be 100% between the company and the employee. Involving the consumer is asinine and an antiquated custom we should do away with.

Tipping is an unpleasant anti consumer thing in America. Go to other countries without tipping it is great!!!
Tipping needs to die.

I tip a flat 20% because of the stupid system we have in place. Tipping is an asinine practice that should be abolished. Pay should be between the employee and the company and shouldn't involve the customer one bit.
If I get bad service I stop going to the place that provided the bad service. If they hire substandard people that is the companies fault.
Have you ever been somewhere without tipping? It is wonderful!

Then they shouldn't work for uber...

I am a customer complaining about an employee violating the rules the service puts forth...
No different than if I went to a restaurant that did not allow tips by policy and the server begged for tips like this guy is doing.

No. I will never tip an uber driver. Ever. If that shit becomes the norm I will just go back to cabs. That is one of the major selling points of uber. I can just get out of the car when the ride is over.

Why should I even have to? Why can't I just immediately pay when I order and then just leave when I am done? The real inconvenience is waiting for the check at the end, waiting for the server to charge the card and bring out the receipt. Often this can had 5-20 minutes to the process and isn't necessary and doesn't benefit me in any way.
Immediately ask for a check after getting the food and pay then? Good way to be ignored for the rest of the meal, I have tried this a few times.
I used to be in the service industry and on the other side of tips so I am not unsympathetic to service workers. We should as a culture charge a fair price for the services delivered and pay the service provider a real wage and be done with tipping. 
This would in the long term be far better for everyone.
