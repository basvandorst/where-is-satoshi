That's exactly what I was thinking.  I hope this exchange can keep a good reputation, so much wealth can be protected from the Mexican government.

I'm not up to speed, why do you trust Circle?  Buying Btc through Coinbase has been great for me.  Has Circle earned your trust somehow?

What website is this?
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:52:20
Or the state, WA and CO.

I think it's a combination of things.  People are getting tired of inflationary currencies, all their wealth buys less and less each year.  Paying someone with Bitcoin provides a transparent and cheap way to do business.

Omar isn't a legislator.  The law is pretty clear about contract murder.  The game is following the law.

What a terrible waste of human energy.

Why do you say that BTC would be easier to acquire than USD?

I kind of assumed that the recent uptick in price is in anticipation of the upcoming halvening.

If Bitcoin becomes centralized and a certain group is profiting more than basic users, won't the users then un-adopt?  Won't people just get out, then the centralized groups would be left with a worthless currency.  So, therefore isn't it in the interest of powerful miner groups to be responsible and keep Bitcoin strong?

Nothing.  Bitcoin is an inelastic commodity, when the price rises you can't just make more and increase the supply.  This is truly unique in history.

Thanks.

I peed a little.

You don't always have to speculate hard, in fact sometimes that's not right to do.

Congratulations man, ride it to an upper middle class/ lower upper class existence!  That's the dream for a working schlub like me.

What is this RAT you speak of, sir?
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:04:44
Thanks.  I've been thinking of getting into a group buy.
@_date: 2013-07-21 05:52:21
Pretty much in Bitcoin.

And it would love you.
