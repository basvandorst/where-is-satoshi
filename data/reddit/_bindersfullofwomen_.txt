LLC's and other S-Corps are only useful as passthroughs for income tax purposes. By having capital gains taxes go through an LLC you're just creating more work for yourself.

None of this information is accurate. 
FATCA doesn't apply since Bitcoin isn't owned by any one foreign government. 
A money transmitter license also does not apply. Sure, it's possible that the IRS interprets it that way - but they have not issued guidance stating that, and as such the average person cannot be expected to know that. 
If you have questions or concerns about paying taxes on your capital gains, consult an accountant - not this guy.

Then if I put another $1,000 in on Saturday, my limit will show $500 left.

You start with all your bitcoins in Wallet1. You send them through a Bitcoin washing service (you can google them, there are a few) where they shuffle the total balance through a number of random wallets and then eventually deposit them into Wallet2.  This is done automatically. No idea how long it takes as I've never done something with that many bitcoins. 
And yes, you'd want to create wallet1 and wallet2 separately. Ideally wallet2 is created on an air-gapped computer so as to not be tied to wallet1 in anyway. 
In this 19,000 btc scenario, I'd do groups of 100 bitcoins or use a number generator to pick the amount so it's not the same amount getting washed over and over.  From there you just need to slowly but surely wash all of the bitcoins. 
In the event this hypothetical isn't really hypothetical, a tip for providing you information would be greatly appreciated.

Because they can distort what you say or catch you slipping up. Al Capone went to jail for tax fraud because that was the only thing they could pin on him.
Martha Stewart only went to jail for insider trading because she slipped up while talking, without a lawyer, to the police. They weren't even investigating her for insider trading - but because she messed up they were able to arrest her for it.
Just because you think you're innocent of X doesn't mean that you can't be charged with Z after telling them about Y and Z because you think you did nothing wrong.
But you do you. If you want to take that chance, go for it. I'd rather spend a little money to know that I'm safe from opening my mouth and screwing myself over.

This is exactly why I don't think the bitcoin network using a large amount of electricity is a problem. If anything, mass adoption of bitcoin will further encourage companies/people to invest in clean energy sources.
So sure, bitcoin's energy requirements are a problem if we're relying on coal and fossil fuels to power everything. But we aren't, and 5 - 10 years down the road those energy sources will be making up a smaller and smaller percentage of our total energy.

They’re taxed the same way as stocks, via capital gains.

In short, Yes. 
Also, read the guide post the other commentor linked. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:28:05
self reporting isn't burdensome. It's a box in turbo tax for pete's sake where you just have to input your estimated gains. If you have an accountant, it's even easier. 
Also, there is a difference between reporting your capital gains and being audited. No one is being audited right now. The IRS simply asked for information, information that every other investment agency automatically sends to the IRS. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:58:07

The last sentence of what you quoted shows Counbase doesn't consider wallet transfers as sales though.

1. This isn't a tax nightmare. Turbo Tax, literally, has a box you can check for capital gains and will do nearly everything for you in the event you don't have an accountant. 
2. I'm talking to my accountant, understanding tax law and staying up to date on the latest changes is what I pay him for. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:31:17

That's a question to ask your accountant. If they hold the Bitcoin for more than 1 year then it'll be a long-term capital gains tax when they sell it. How much that tax will be will depend on a number of factors and they should speak with an accountant to get that exact number.

You're correct. This would all get filed as a long-term capital gain for this tax year. Well, not "all," just what OP cashed out. 
Depending on OP's tax bracket he could be looking at anything between 12-35%. 
Regardless, OPs having an amazing day. I do have to agree though, the luckiest thing about this was him forgetting about them. Statistically, he would have sold them way before now.

@_date: 2017-11-13 23:11:57
That's a lot of money.

It means you'll have to pay taxes on your gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:31:16


Then you have to make an estimate, but since the transactions are all public you should be able to look up BTC's value from the day/time you purchased it.


You don't pay tax on a capital loss, but the loss is also not tax deductible either - you just lose the money.

My limit order went live at $7,005 earlier today. So I'm quite happy.

All investing, minus index funds, is gambling. The difference is low risk and low reward or high risk and high reward. Bitcoin falls into the high risk category due to its volatility.

Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.

Don't invest money you can't lose. 
Personally, I'd throw 30k into BTC. Then when it gets to 10k I'd sell enough to get back my 30K investment. Then let the remainder ride.

If he sells less than $38k, then capital gains won't apply since it's a long term holding.

Yep, you're right. I just jumped in and got defensive - that's my bad.

Would you say that OP knows what they're doing if they're posting on here asking on what to do?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:20:49
I've never gotten a 1099 from Coinbase, nor GDAX, and I do a fairly large amount of trading. 
What I've done in the past is to just disclose it on my taxes as "miscellaneous crytocurrency gains." I probably could get away with not disclosing it, since I don't get a 1099, but I'd rather not risk getting hit with a huge amount of back taxes in 5 or so years if/when BTC becomes even more mainstream.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:00:27
I know this is a joke, but don't day trade. 95% of the time you will end up losing money and causing yourself stress.

I don't know if there are fees for transfers on GDAX.

How does paying taxes equate to being screwed? If we want Bitcoin to become mainstream and be currency, then treating it as if it was one is necessary. 
You can't complain about paying taxes and in the same breath say Bitcoin should replace fiat. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:24:28
Basically. I'm using a sell-limit order, which means that at X price my order goes live and is fulfilled. 
So for example, if I put a sell-limit order in to sell 0.5 BTC at $10,000, that order won't "go live" (i.e. won't get fulfilled) until BTC is valued at $10,000.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:03:02
Only for transactions that occurred between 2013-2015

GDAX is Coinbase though.

So I walked him through the process last night and he's all setup now on BitPay. Thank again for pointing out that it wasn't working!

I have no idea. He just said that Coinbase was an option he got through Shopify.

Buy from GDAX. They give you a better rate. If coinbase says the current rate is$ 5,000. I guarantee you're buying at like ~$5,025. It says the actual buy rate in fairly small font on the confirmation page. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:10:52
GDAX is the best I've found for large scale buy/selling (as well as day trading) in terms of transfer speed and withdrawal fees.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:53:05
Correct. You only need to report things when you convert to fiat and deposit said fiat into your bank account. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:55:37
Long term holdings are ones that you've held for longer than a year. 
Talk to an accountant. The $500 or so it will cost you will be well spent.

Mining most likely
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:22:37
Buying doesn't mean anything though. I can buy all the stock/Bitcoin I want, I only pay tax on it when I sell it. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:17:45
So does this mean that any BCH coinbase is holding until January will be lost/not given to us?

GDAX. It'll take a few days probably, but as long as she's selling at market value and not asking for a set price - they'll sell.
Then you just move them from your GDAX balance to your bank account.
You'll need to pay capital gains tax on everything she sells though. I'd recommend hiring an accountant for that when it comes up during tax season though.

fyi, if you use your debit card you'll get dinged for an international transaction fee - since coinbase's merchant account is based in the UK
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:53:42
Takes multiple days to get fiat into GDAX if you don't have it there already. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:43:32
No idea. But if your coins are on Coinbase, and you no longer want them to be on coinbase - you're going to have to pay the transfer fee.

After. Yout don't need to report unrealized gains (aka, how much your BTC's have increased in value).
My method is to do small trades, where I'm netting $100 - $500 profit per transaction, and I report/dislocse the fiat that I'm cashing out of GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:50:43
Up to you. I invested in ETH when it started and I'v got a sell order placed that'll net me $2.7K once it clears. Mind you this was after letting it sit for almost a year. 
I'd say alt coins, overall, are higher risk and lower reward than Bitcoin. Because at the end of the day, there's only going to be one cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:34:51
Yes. It's uncommon to turn a profit mining Bitcoin. 
It's not that the entry barriers are insane, but that the total cost, plus electricity, makes it very hard to break even in the beginning. You then run into an issue of your mining rig becoming out of date / inefficient before you're able to break even. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:28:16
Hey says he thinks he fixed it. When you get a chance, could you try again?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:55:00
Yes and no. If you withdraw 20k of short-term capital gains, and that's your only income for the year - you'll pay taxes on it. 
If you withdraw 20k of long term capital gains, and that's your only income for the year - there are no taxes.
