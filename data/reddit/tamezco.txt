Hi there. We are building a hardware wallet. You can carry and spend Bitcoin with it, most likely with Lightning Network. I am the founder and looking for feedback from r/Bitcoin - what do you think?

Yeah, we should be able to offer the product at lower prices later (and likely a better earlybird price). To begin, we just need to make sure that we cover all expenses. A lot of hardware startups under-price at the beginning, run out of money, and never ship. So, we think this is a fair MSRP for now. Thanks again for the feedback.

Thanks for your skepticism - we like hard questions. There is a lot of information on the product that is not yet published. For example, we have a whitepaper with technical details. 
Regarding the Lightning Network integration, we have chatted with Lightning Labs. If the counterparty is on the Lightning Network, then a client on your wrist wallet can make payments over the network. The device is a Lightning node :)
We want to share more technical information and will add a blog soon. For now, we are still very focused on building.

Thanks! So $20 does not purchase the device. It gives you a reservation (kind of like reserving a Tesla) that saves your place in the queue, and makes sure you get it early with the very best deal. Retail price is $275. You can cancel the reservation anytime and receive a refund.

What happens at the Bitcoin Store?
