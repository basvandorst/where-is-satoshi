Okay, I'm seriously thinking about a bid for one block. Any suggestions or thoughts about a price?

Marc Andressen is the B team? That's just laughable right there.

I've met Patrick and spent a few hours one on one. He's unusual but one of the most brilliant people I have ever met. He had foresight into many many internet trends that came to fruition.

Hey Lady,
What do you think most people use for drugs? Cash money. It ain't the coin that's the issue.

Miners have massive electricity bills that require fiat to pay.

This is brilliant. I recommend it.

I should have this until the lawyer calls in the morning threatening to ruin my life and end me. Can't wait.

How much below market would you go? I don't have that kind of cash but I can borrow it.

Does your reading mean that operating a pool requires registration?

I'm in $100k and I'm going in another 40k tomorrow. Long live bitcoin.

Good. Let him sleep as long as possible.

Anyone who can't handle a 75% in any 48 hour period probably shouldn't hold bitcoins. Just fire and forget. Use them to shop and look at the value in a couple of years.

Great stuff. Thanks.

Well, if we're going to be anal then the correct word is "its".
Coinbase is an entity not people. Regardless of what the Supreme Court says.

It will be an abstraction of bit coin and the level of investment will correlate directly with what it must hold to represent the fair interest of the ETF holders. Yes they probably can buy from their own holdings for a while.
Bitcoin is a mother scratching pain in the butt to buy so it may really bring a lot of people into bitcoin investing from a way that is more comfortable to investors who are confused about bitcoin. This is a good thing. The broader base of investor the smoother the price curve.

Then what the fuck is it?

It would be pretty cool to mine the last Bitcoin.

Sounds awesome. 
Now add the ability to add all of your users to a mining pool when computer is unused. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:57:30
End timer, 
You're right. It took me about a half hour to begin mining. But about ten days to get coinbase working and complete a purchase.  
Bitcoin won't spread widely until it's as easy to buy and sell as using a credit card.

Thanks Daddy. Way to build up my self esteem for the holidays.
