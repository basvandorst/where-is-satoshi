I have a PhD in engineering and know quite a lot about this tech. Believe whatever you want of course but I am convinced that BTC is the future. I am not selling and neither are most people that know what they are talking about. It's your choice to either spread FUD or do some proper research. Cheers.

It's still permissionless. Imagine if your country has a digital currency and decides that you are a "threat" and freezes your accounts. When physical cash doesn't exist anymore, you wont be able to buy food and water or anything. Good luck surviving then. Bitcoin might not be fully anonymous but at least no one can stop you from using it.

But the seller could still sell one certificate to multiple people. Each of the buyers can verify that the seller has the actual Bitcoin. As long as neither of the buyers demand physical delivery, the seller could potentially sell this one BTC (certificate) to thousands of people, right?

He mainly refers to the increase in hashrate and its corresponding energy cost. I think he simply extrapolated the current hashrate growth and calculated the cost to mine 1 BTC with the current price of kWh.

People are interested in it for two reasons. Getting rich or using the tech. Right now, it's pretty much only to get rich and most of these people will (or already have) jump ship. Use cases are still in their infancy but it will mature. The question is, will the use cases be good enough to convince average joe to invest. I think so and I highly doubt this is the end of BTC, since the fundamentals are only getting better.

By crashing I mean a healthy correction. We have been in a bull market since 2008 and right now it doesn't seem healthy. All the stock buybacks and QE lead to this situation. What goes up, must eventually come down. When that happens, we can buy cheap stocks and then let it run up again.

I agree that there should be an incentive to use LN. However, I don't believe that incentive should necessarily be higher fees, though. If LN were ready, I might agree with you, but it's not. I run my own LN node and I still can't really use it and is quite complicated. It sure takes some time to get the ball running but we are close to the next bullrun and LN won't support it. Furthermore, BTC on-chain is not even close to handle the incoming transactions. So the new buyers will only be institutions because retail won't be able to afford $50-100 fees. That means the adoption will be suppressed, which nobody wants. I would be glad to hear some positive counter arguments or technical solutions (except segwit) for the short- and midterm future. Anyways, thanks for your post and your hard work. A lot counts on you guys to make a bright future! 
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:24:29
I don't see how the hashrate is tied to a single person: [
Who would that be? I am open to be corrected if you have proof. 
I also run a working node but it is (still) way too complicated for average users. I had to pay over $10 in tx fees to open my channels and it took me a while to get some remote balance. Tell that to a regular joe. I'm all for LN but I'm also for mass adoption as fast as possible and in this regard BCH is taking a faster approach. 
All I'm saying is that we should keep an open mind and respect different approaches. I use BTC since 2013 hope it will stay with us forever, but right now I can't (don't want to) use it to purchase stuff because of the high tx fees.
@_date: 2019-04-14 11:01:19
Good point, thanks.
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:15:33
Let's look at the math. A redditor calculated the cost if BCH had 1gb blocks. In regards to running nodes, I don't see a big danger in centralisation: [
I am pro BTC AND pro BCH. Let each try their thing and the people will eventually decide what is the best solution (maybe both are). What I'm trying to say is that war within is counterproductive. It's the banks we need to fight, not ourselves.

@_date: 2019-04-14 09:52:54
Thanks for your detailed response. I knew of some of those issues already but you also showed me some new ones. I will re-evaluate my current position accordingly. The question is, which technical problems can be solved. I support any path that might solve the scaling problem and we will see which path is best in the next few years. I'm still more in favour of BTC but if BCH makes a better case, I'm ok with it, as well.
@_date: 2019-04-13 22:44:10
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:49:34
I suggest you do proper research before writing something like this. About a year ago, I felt similar to your post but I changed my mind after understanding more about the tech. To call Bcash trash is simply a disservice. They have a different approach and philosophy. Yes, they are sometimes a little too aggressive in regards to promotion but their approach is legitimate. We still don't know if LN really works (I run a LN node) and a higher block size is at least an alternative solution to scaling. Don't be a sheep and make up your own mind by doing proper research.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:05:02

Yes man, f*ck everyone who sells!! They are not seeing the future. 
Sure, I'm down on my investment but only for now. Mid to long term, I'll be f'cking rich. If you sell, you are a dumb sheep and deserve to get f*cked. This is probably going to get downvoted but I'm so pissed that so many people who sell are so short sighted and are only in it for the money. You have a chance to change the status quo on the global monetary system and all the sellers think about a few bucks. Pathetic! 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:47:02
An emotional perspective I wanted to share: 
The first time I bought my first BTC, I instantly fell in love with it. It can have that effect on people. I actually know a few. So why not give it a try? Spread the love! :)

Don't underestimate the greed people have. As soon as the next bull run starts, all bad feelings are forgotten and most of the "victims" are back in the game. 
I try to see this selloff as a good thing because it might help adoption. All the people in Venezuela, Argentina etc. can safe their lives and even become wealthy if they accumulate during this time. More power to the normal folks out there. Screw the super rich guys who still have all the power. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:48:11

As much as we all want more awareness and faster adoption, these things take time. Environmentalism started in the 70s if I recall correctly. So it took pretty much 50 years to become what it is today. I'd say we are pretty fast with crypto already. The moon will be within reach in the next 5-10 years. All we can do is educate ourselves and others and let it run its course.

Thanks for tthat link. I am now convinced that Satoshi was a group of coders who collaborated on the BTC project. Craig was one in the group and as many people do, he thinks that he did the majority of the work on this project. Hence he believes he represents (is) Satoshi. It's not really lying but a distorted view of reality. There is no Satoshi individual. Just Satoshi as a hive mind.

@_date: 2018-12-08 20:25:10
Yes, after a certain amount of blocks the difficulty is being adjusted. However, if the hashrate goes down too quickly, the difficulty adjustment takes longer because the blocks take longer to be created. For example, it might take up to 5 weeks instead of the usual 2 weeks. But it's not really a problem. It's part of the design. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:57:17
Even worse than a scam because of Rehypothecation. They can put the whole bitcoin system in danger.

@_date: 2018-12-07 10:55:25
LN is not established well enough, yet. We have a little over 4000 nodes at the moment. It takes a little more time before the scaling is fully implemented. If we had a bull run like last year, we would have a similar issue with high fees, again. I estimate another half year and we are good to go. :)

Yes, keeping them in your own wallet is of course preferable. 
I'm mostly concerned about the U.S. Investment Trust Grayscale who now owns 1% of all Bitcoins. They lend bitcoins and probably rehypothecate all the time.

tl:dr - Fiat bad, crypto good
Get as much BTC as possible before the whole world starts really using it. The $$ is history.

All that matters is that you have a choice.

That dude probably already has all that.

It's intertwined. Think of it as every new bitcoin transaction can hold tenfold more bitcoin transactions within itself. So it also has the security and all the other good properties as a normal bitcoin transaction. If you are really interested in all this, look up [Andreas Antonopoulus](

All this is extremely fishy. Who the F would buy any of those coins. The fact that SV is going up while every other coin is going down shows how much the market is manipulated atm. I hope 90% of the altcoins burn soon. We need a healthy market, again.

That's how you (should) do it! :)
Those people, doing extreme buying or selling are not going to be around for long.

Calm down. You seem quite emotional in this regard. Nobody of forcing you to spend your money on bitcoin. If you look closely, you will see that bitcoin is not a scam. Some cryptos are, but not all. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 07:58:30
That's why it's better to look at the amount of nodes. We have over 4k nodes and growing steadily. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:34:09
I think so, too. However, do we really know that it's him pumping? Does he really have so much BTC to sell?

I am only able to connect my coinbase wallet. where did you find the option to connect to your ln node?

*Essentially, it has become a war between cryptocurrency and fiat, whether Bitcoiners like it or not. The launch of CME Bitcoin futures is equivalent to a nuclear attack on the Bitcoin market, but there are other forces in play. The United States debt is approaching $22 trillion, and the government cannot afford to cut the deficit, so this debt will continue to spiral out of control, and that will cause the dollar to inevitably fail.*
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:00:19
What makes you think that? Do you have any interesting unofficial news?
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:58:01
You mean repeat until limbo. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:58:54
Thanks for the summary. Gives me more confidence that LN might actually work, especially with dual-funded channels.
@_date: 2018-12-31 11:20:40
I stand corrected.
