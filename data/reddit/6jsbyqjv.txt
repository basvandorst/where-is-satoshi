Were a central bank, hypothetically, to announce it was going to allocate some of it's foreign currency to Bitcoin..... things would go Zing!!

Dude you're high. Breathe deeply.

1. Read Andreas Antonopoulos's book for a start. If you can't be bothered, listen to his interviews on Joe Rogan where he explains it eloquently to novices in under 3 hours per episode.
2. don't let anyone else see your private keys / the QR to your private keys / the words that generate your private keys

Be careful here. The listing of futures opens up BTC to unbacked shorting. Just look at manipulation in silver and gold. At least the perception of unbacked shorting.
Not all futures players will be pressing the buy button.

I'd like to add to this thread. Withdrew some ETH to an external wallet this week. Transaction is marked as 'completed'. They even gave me a transaction id. However, this tx id doesn't exist in etherscan.io nor is the ETH in my wallet.
Number of replies to my ticket? None

I agree. I think it's strange this point of view doesn't get repeated more. 
In terms of a trade, I consider now a good time to sell my BTC. Fade the excitement.

But we we need some buying support to make the price continue higher. So please DO invest.

Well almost anyone can invest in Bitcoin for whatever reason. I just don't think Zug council should be investing in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-05 13:28:12
Maybe there'll start holding Bitcoin when they start having liabilities in Bitcoin. Until then why would they hold? Not sure the Zug council have any business punting Bitcoin.

Maybe your account is being monitored by fraud authorities. Was it a large transfer? How many zeroes?

I got my ETH after 2-3 days
