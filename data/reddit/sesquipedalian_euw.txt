The control of the wallet isnt the issue here, we choose for that because we wanted to. To keep track of all the movement we all write down the transactions needed as we see fit and when we settle we compare our lists first to make sure we dont have any errors in them (like missing transactions)

By your standards perhaps, not by mine. Its fine to have your own opinion though, im not judging you, as this doesnt mean 'it sucks' or 'its bad', its just not a trustless. It isnt supposed to be trustless, else it wouldnt have worked in the first place.

There are currently too many false and made-up definitions of trustless network spread around over the last few years to make this a quick one pager. Trustless has unfortunately been taken as a buzzword and people are mostly just copying this without understanding it and labeling things as if, just to make it sound cool and tech savvy. I'm not stating your coins are at risk, feel free to use it - thats what it was designed for in the first place, just understand it has its limitations. Trust/trustless networks are not that easily explained, thats why many people claim that their coin or network is trustless and people are evaluating this mostly based on the opinion of actually pretty random but 'popular' people on social media that they like the most instead of actual research. So i dont mind you not believing me, but there is no need to add the buzzword to make it sound 'legit' as i just happen to be allergic to those kind of things =)

i agree that going onchain for small transactions is not worth it when it comes to bitcoin, but the goal is to get to a fast settlement and there is no settlement happening here. 
 
Please dont forget that LN is not trustless, it looks like trustless is used as a buzzword people love spread but it misses some of the key fundamentals of a trustless network if you look into it. 
 
Dont get me wrong, i like the fact that LN is available, but i dont understand the hype people are attaching to it. I'm a guy who worked many years at the top of the financial sector dealing with setting up barter systems with other companies and dealing with the disputes. I see the capabilities and limitations for LN and those who deny its limitations obviously do not share the amount of experience i have been given during my carreer. I'm not here to shill another coin that has lower transaction fee's or does instant settlement - and they are around - because those coins miss the volume and marketposition that only BTC has for now. Again, i'm not here to talk bad about LN, i just wished people would be a little realistic. Dont underestimate that the eventual part of settlement still have to happen
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:16:55
transactionspeed - dont rly care. I can do the same writing IOU's on a piece of paper. But what about the settlement? When does the settlement happen on a scale where everyone on the LN is able to use the amount they claim to have received to send elsewhere or cash it out?
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:38:45
 
My 4 friends and i have a wallet together that i control, when we go out to dinner or for drinks we balance it later on by moving around the funds of BTC. 
 
Its written on excel. 0 transactionfee's so far baby! wohooo. Well - besides the amount we needed to send the funds to me and, when we are going to cash out, then we have to deal with that again because then we have to send it on exchanges - Same thing you still need to do i guess. So - like me, u are halfway there. You do it all digitally, I do it on paper. I think its pretty much the same for us, but if i would evern have an argument about the legitimacy of any of our transactions, i will call up my friends and tell them how i feel about it, and we disuss it and clear the air. 
 
Thankfully we are a great group and have known eachother for a long time - if this happens it will not destroy our friendschip as we value our friendship over our forturne. Anyway - can't wait to hear the end-costs of it all when you cashed out, and the costs you made to send funds into the pool at first. Howmuch would the total be then?

ah well you know the regular fud the non-crypto world uses and how they think of us... we are all criminals, our goal is to scam people, try to steal other wallets and fraud the governments - all together while buying drugs with it. Thats how they see us, and thats how they judge us, they should be educated

the first 3 letters of the word 'news' usually give it away that news should be something new, ur posting old stuff from a 3d ranked website that gets its news not by investigation but by copying other newsfeeds. Reuters just reported something regarding the FSB (finance stability board) about the regulations.  
 
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:27:46
ur calling reuters fake news?
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:25:29
short term: well, lets put in an example:
 
to avoid rape, you can ban all sex - but making new rules in a quickly manner would make some others a victim that you wanted to avoid. Collateral damage, if it is something that is drastically needed, they would - but it looks like they take us more serious and understand they dont want to hurt the 99.99% just to counter the 0.01% of bad intentions
 
You want to be able to create rules to counter fraud, theft and scams but it shouldnt be pushing the entire market down as it affects more than just people that would consider a fraud/theft/scams. at peak, only 1% of the market was crypto - so to target these fraud/theft/scams (that would be a very small amount of the 1%) they rather enforce the current regulations better than making up new ones. In short term, this could indicate the market can return bullish - no more fear of exchanges shutting down or enforced special laws that just target the cryptospace
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:57:27
So far what i have picked up from the news sources, the FSB said 'no' on creating regulations specifically for 'scams thefts and fraud' in crypto, since these scams theft and fraud cases have not hurted the cryptocurrencies by that much and the indication would be that the regulations that would be drafted for that would initially hurt the cryptocurrency market more than the scams/fraud/theft would.
 
what countries? well, some i believe Japan, korea, germany, usa, france at least

I think they just sold and want the price to drop...
@_date: 2018-03-19 09:05:25
Afraid to accidentally kill the market by enforcing too many new and untested regulations just to target the scams frauds and thefts without knowing if those new rules would help or not
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:42:50
I’m sure coindesk send out their reporters and started to investigate!
 
It’s Reuters, they say they will not talk about adding new regulations, so the market doesn’t have to fear something new. Besides, coindesk is not a news website..

Economics 101 
 
if the supply of the product that is in demand is lowered, the price will go up. you will not see it directly when it happens, because they will probably combine it with forcing people to sell their bitcoins (all-out bitcoin ban) so with people being forced to sell, the price will go down a bit, not as much as people will think because of the mining ban and it will go up shortly after and remain a steady pace. As soon as China finds a way to allow bitcoins again, the price will double up from that and gg bitcoins. Sell and restock if you wish, the more risk you take the more profit you can make - but you can also lose the most. Safe way: Restock at levels you feel comfortable buying at, dont sell, just restock and restock and dont touch it for a year, look again and either you can buy yourself the most expensive cup of coffee with it or a lamborghini
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:55:30
ye but that goes beyond logics, thats emotions. im not going to bet on emotions of new-to-the-game bitcoin shoppers who see every 5% drop as a major thing. If i wake up tomorrow and bitcoin is down to 2000 i will just laugh and enjoy my sip of coffee, see the news what happened (ico ban? or a way to protect investors? bitcoin exchange ban? or a way to regulate CNY currency? mining ban bad? or will it now give a better position to other miners and will it increase the price overtime? bitcoin ban? you mean people are forced to sell for cheap?)  think about it, then probably call my bank and transfer money to my trading account to buy more bitcoin for cheap.
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:49:04
i had a friend saying 'dude, buy bitcoin' when it was low 10$ years ago and i laughed in his face and called him stupid for buying alot of them. He cashed out recently and is enjoying his new life and lambo's.
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:00:49
the point is: does it really matter? why do people press the panic button before thinking? It will mean basically that mining will become more profitable as hashrates are needed, the amounts of bitcoins generated per day will be less thus the price will go up. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:54:35
dont worry my friend, its neither a win or a loss untill you sell it again, so as long as you keep it you have nothing to worry about!

holy shit, thought today was a good day for options. i see bad news coming in! im like 'yeah, lets go short on bitcoin'.. within minutes im on a 200 profit, and like 10 min ago.. i suddenly get a text with a margin call, market shoots up 5% and im down 1k xD holy shit this market man!

just read it and understand it. The FSB fires back saying 'no' to new regulations - and to 'use the regulations we have in place'. You think 'France' or 'USA' is a cryptocurrency or regulation expert? The g20 are members of a group that calls in experts to see if they can meet their demands or if their demands can be met. If a watchdog/regulator for the G20 gives an advise, its more important than a countries demand. These are politicians, not doctors who can actually perform a surgery - talking about how they wish the surgery would be performed. 
 
Using the current regulations means that overal KYC, AMC, exchanges to meet the SEC criteria, banks to hold criteria for USD to be used on exchanges where people can have accounts holding USD.. The regular stuff.
 
I wish they would create good, new and specific regulations, but first do enough research to make sure they wouldnt hurt the 99% just to get to the 1% of the bad actors. Making up new laws and rules take time, this isnt done overnight

as soon as the bitcoins are more spread out, the movement will be less.. violent. The price will increase but without the +20% -30% days. the question should be: "howlong will it take for the bitcoin to be more spread around? or - like before - will 'the investors' accept that some people will get extremely rich by pushing the price in an earlier stage? oh and besides.. any of you guys realise that with only 1% of the world in crypto's, bitcoins is 4k? what happens if 5% of the world gets into crypto? limited supply, mining is slow, higher demand, price? bye roof! Call me crazy, i wont even sell it it gets 15k now. the only thing i will do once it hits 15k is buy lambo stock because they will go to the moon :)

G20-FSB rejects calls for cryptocurrency regulation
18/03 | 19:36 | By REUTERS
LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for G20 countries, on Sunday rejected calls from several countries for cryptocurrency regulation, such as bitcoin .
The FSB, however, stressed the need for greater international coordination in monitoring these rapidly evolving technologies, which still represent a tiny sector equivalent to less than 1% of global gross domestic product.
"The first assessment of the FSB is that currently, these crypto-assets do not pose a risk to global financial stability," said Mark Carney, president of the FSB, in a letter to finance ministers and governors of central banks, which will meet in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday.
Mark Carney, who will leave his post next year, when he resigns as Governor of the Bank of England, noted that his successor would oversee a regulator more inclined to review existing rules than to set up new ones.
In his letter, he also said that the FSB, which has conducted a series of banking and financial reforms after the 2007-2009 crisis, will focus on the current rules rather than design new ones.
"As the work of the FSB, which aims to fill the fault lines that caused the financial crisis, is nearing its end, the latter will focus more (..) on the implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effects. reforms approved by the G20, "said Mark Carney.
