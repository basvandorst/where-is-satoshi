Will it have a performance issue? 
@_date: 2016-04-15 12:22:26
No , I mean whether Bitcoin LN and Litecoin LN can swap their LN token in decentralized manner or LN can work only within their own blockchain.
@_date: 2016-04-15 08:21:27
I cant see how LN is blockchain agnostic.
Could you give me some explanation?
@_date: 2016-04-15 12:15:55
Thanks I will read it many times.

Now It works! seems like it takes longer than usual.
@_date: 2016-04-10 10:14:13
I updated it. but no progress what so ever.
It stocked.

Why not use smart contract platform(Ethereum?) for 1:1 peg between bitcoin &lt;-&gt; sidechain?

I may complete idiot but.. Can we use ZKP as some kind of half-open-source? Many altcoins take advantage of Bitcoin's open source... Hide source code but proof it is not gimmick through ZKP... at least partial of it.. can it be done?

It's been a while since death sentence to bitcoin. 
There will be one again.. expect another drama queen...

Public ledger system is robust but inherently slow. 
Wait until LN implemented. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 09:28:56
That's why we need LN. ASAP
