Yup, I have set up a paper wallet for my daughter to which she gains access to on her 18th birthday.

Was thinking about the perfect solution too and just solved it for my personal use. Maybe it's interesting for your thing: UV active color. Or something similar.  
Anyone with a good functioning brain sees the regular hidden qr code in a picture sooner or later, which has just been hidden by letting it blend in a bit. But not if you need special light for seeing it. Or a special angle.  
  
To hide the "shiny" effect a special UV active color (or similar) may give the paper, it needs more tricks of camouflaging that too. But I'll figure it out too I guess.  
  
Really hiding something really well isn't that easy. At least in print usage. Digital jpg use is different and easier. Also it depends from which kind of people you want to hide it. A regular Joe may be easier to fool than trained authorities. All depends on the situation and can be cheap or very expensive, time consuming and hard to do.  
  
PS: Also just cutting the code into several pieces digitally before printing it and putting each piece on a different kind of print media can bring extra security. But this also brings extra danger of losing everything if it's a private key without a backup.  
  
If you like to do this the serious way, think like an artist and always have the worst case scenario in the back of your head to improve the technique.  
And don't forget: Print media can get damaged by fire/water and can lose colors from sunlight and when you don't expect it - just like a harddrive can die randomly.
  
But in the end I'm just a regular user too and don't know shit about what I'm saying here.

Sadly I don't have access to an Android device.  
But this reminds me of something: Ages ago banks gave our schools test accounts for playing around with stocks. Just fake stocks. Which was cool because you couldn't do any damage/gains. Just play around.  
  
Maybe THIS brings a wider mass of people into Bitcoin. Let them play around with different szenarios, buying, selling, getting hacked, securing your coins and what not. Takes away the stress you normally have with real coins and teaches you all about it with great fun. Learning by doing.

What the duck, really???
Oh. My. Fucking. God.
 
NICE! That's what I've just been waiting for!
 
Please, more confirmations that this is no late April fools joke.

No idea why you are being downvoted, but you are right. He's trying to troll everywhere he can. He's just a troll, ignore his shit and move on. He'll lose his power anyway sooner or later. :)
(Now go ahead and downvote this comment too because it's true.)

*you’ll need to provide us with your verification documents – ID and Proof of address.*  
  
Did I get that wrong or does BTC-e now do the KYC thing? Did they ever ask for personal information like this in the past??

I somehow have this feeling that Andreads needs to tattoo this on his back really big.
