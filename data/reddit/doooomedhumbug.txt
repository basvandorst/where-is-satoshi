Still, would be cool if I could spend my crypto more places. 
My dream is a bar near where I live that accepts crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:57:04
I believe you can use something like bitpay to accept multiple cryptos easily.

The problem is slow transfers and high fees.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:21:35
I love Bitcoin and upvoted this. We need to solve these problems, and they CAN be solved.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:34:24
Exactly. Miners want Bitcoin to succeed.

I almost wanted to leave it

Source? I googled it and everything I found said that's not true.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:42:13
I believe this kind of marketing is aimed at regular customers that in most cases pay significant amount of fees. 
I'm not saying it's a good point or that I agree with it, just what they're doing and why.

Missing /s

Huh? 1 usd changes in value every day. A can of pop used to cost 25 cents. USD is definitely going down while BTC is going up.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:24:08
It used to be a currency, but you're correct. It isn't anymore. Things change.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:52:26
Another crypto may have to replace it.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:47:40
It might be a tip or somebody that loves you!
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:30:41
I really wish more places adopted segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:44:16
I have no problem with this. Bitcoin as my savings account, Litecoin as my checking account.

Don't forget about all the fork coins we'll have as well. Assuming everybody is holding in a wallet...
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:09:36
Sounds like you have it under control. Good luck!

Real question is always in the comments.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:36:48
It's because people are comparing it to ~~baking~~ banking, which for a large amount helps illustrate the advantage a crypto like Bitcoin has over banks.

There is just so much hate for crypto. I've been told I can't cash out (I have twice), it's all worthless (with more than USD to me), it's going to crash to 0 (Bitcoin is.. 9 years old now? Or 10?), Etc
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:43:11
I can make an ERC20 coin in less than 60 minutes. It's easy as hell haha
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:11:07
Correction at 25k? Goes down to 5k, then I can buy in more!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:11:35
I'm guessing at 25k.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:11:40
Ty, if enough people sell I'll get some more :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:13:24
It always corrects, then goes 50 x higher.
35 to 2, then 120 to 30, then 1200 to 250
Now will be.. 25,000 to 5,000? Then next is 300,000 to 70k?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:15:28
I bid 10,001

My bank blocks payments to coinbase now.
