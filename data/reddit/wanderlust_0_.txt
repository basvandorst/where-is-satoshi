By doubling the capacity, one will be doubling throughput. Fees will go down and confirmation times will shorten.
Yes, it is a short term solution. In the long term, other solutions will be rolled out. Core team seems to be knowledgeable.

If it is Bitcoin Core, then you need to have a safe copy (or three copies of your wallet.dat), that is assuming you are running bitcoin core.
If you are trying to install Bitcoin core, you will need to replace newly generated wallet with your original wallet (that has your original private key info). Hope that helps.

Thank you. I assume I can use the same trick to sell the coins.

If that is the thinking "... not enough one LN payment channel per person on earth", then hardfork to 2MB, or 32MB will not solve the issue.

what will happen with my payment that was on invalid or orphaned block?

If transaction fees are properly managed (kept low, zero, or nearly zero) then this technology has no limits.

Well, you need private keys associated with the public address. Private keys have to be hodled tightly.

It will pay for itself, only if BTC price will continue growing.
I did calculations today, and S9 would generate 0.1 BTC per month (feel free to check my math). Most likely one year from now it will be obsolete, as there is even better version of 15TH miner expected to be launched in two month.
That being said, I think that one S9 miner will generate approx 0.8 BTC in one year, while providing free heat. One year from now difficulty should increase by three times, while the price of BTC will rise to $15,000. Keep in mind that there are electricity costs as well.
You can make money under the following conditions:
 - Bitcoin price keeps rising
- Bitcoin hashing difficulty increase will be linear
- the price of electricity is very low
Under these conditions, S9 miner becomes a dollar hedge against increase of BTC price.
You are facing competition of large farm mines who:
- pay wholesale electricity prices - 1c, 2c, up to 8 c.
- Get serious discounts on hardware from manufacturers

Seriously, hardware S9 is the minimum to even break even.
All other hardware will consume more electricity than you will end up getting bitcoin. It is cheaper to buy BTC, rather than investing in obsolete hardware.
If you are mining with GTX 1070, you may be better off mining ETH and converting to BTC.

I just recently discovered that I had some older btc account, leftover from my earlier gaming related purchases. I knew about it but never thought this was valuable. My discovery will help me to pay my studies, but will not make me a millionaire..haha, far from that. I will be spending less time gaming, more attention for bitcoin and will be educating myself on the subject. This is a nice uplift for me to get rid of my gaming addiction.

Your reasoning lacks logic. Because of people like you wars happen and a lot of people are killed and oppressed. Your taxes, as well as taxes collected by others finance wars.
When you say that mankind is selfish: how exactly humans survived, formed families and communities before there were states and writing. 
Your reasoning is so unacceptable to the hardworking and honest part of population.
Taxation is ALWAYS in immoral.

Thank you for correcting me.

Just like bitcoin is a change in paradigms, you will also need to change the way you think. 
You are welcome to pay and overpay taxes.
Do not suggest that others need to do that. 
Involuntary taxes (partial slavery) and civilized society are not compatible.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:45:24
Yes, yes. But they are premined. 
With Bitcoin you at least have a chance of making your own BTC, with IOTA you are already delegated to be third class citizen, who proudly can transact for free.

thank you for correcting me. I am just overexcited for making tidy sum this year I cannot feel but positively about blockchain technology.

If someone had $5 Billion, it would be possible to create much better, faster and more efficient competitor to BTC, while doing the following:
1. Market making mechanism. Allowing smooth market price  changes, by supporting market price.
2. Hiring top notch developers.
3. Putting key nodes on superfast dedicated optical fiber
4. Putting serious marketing campaign
5. Financing market acceptance by partnering with some whales like Amazon and Alibaba, Ebay, and similar online shopping giants
With $5B it it is possible to create entirely new competitor

Thank you for your comment. I think I understand cryptocurrency, however my response was dictated and influenced by the contextual question.

Does that mean if Mast is implemented, smart contracts will be enabled on bitcoin? Just like Ether network?
