Hello - looking to start out bit coining but all the Australian "purchase" points are tainted with very VERY untrustworthy processes or people. Help me get started!

Not very, as in not very trustworthy, or not very likely I'll lose my money?
also my own wallet such as one downloaded from blockchain?

This is a delusion - reason being - first sentence "us early starters". It's common in human psychology to assume you're always right and imagine being rich and mighty - it's a self value thing. With the trend line progression of the bitcoin price I'd say the hype train has parked itself and the fiat money system will continue to function because way too many people are indoctrinated into it. it would take years of generational education to reteach the population about non regulated currencies and implement it. Probably various wars too. Bitcoin in 2018  will still be the same as it is now - only the price and it's access will have changed. Its value may have stabilized and it's public access is greater. Governments will be implementing systems to determine how to regulate and tax it and effectively they will slowly squeeze its unregulated soul into regulation just like the fiat system. Why? Because the minute bitcoin was given a fiat value - bitcoin lost.
