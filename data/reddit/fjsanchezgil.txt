I can't understand why don't they use Ripple Network. They have a lot of money invested on it...

I allways bought it on exchanges. Bitstamp, Poloniex, Kraken and Criptsy (defunct).
Zero problems.
I've also buy on ebay. It's more expensive, but the potentials problems are for the sellers (chargebacks and so on), not for the buyers (as you are)

Nope. It doesn't aport any signifcant for the cripyto-ecosystem.
I spent too much satoshis on that shitcoin :(

I think it's exactly that they need. Once your fiat are an "i owe you" on ripple network, you can send it fast and secure to anybody.
Why they need a blockchain to do it?

Ripple was not closed when i kwon it,  a couple of years ago.  You can now check the balance and transactions for any ripple address here, for example 
Kyc is a shit, but all banks must do it, by law, so i'm still surprised about they don,t embrace ripple yet. Specially Santander, that has invest a lot of money on Ripple labs

Assuming you have a file in the form as bitcoind command dumprivkeys generates, similar to this:
     adddr1   pass1
     adddr2   pass2
     ...
     adddrn   pass3
you can try with this shellscript on bash (let's call it transform.sh)
    
    printf '['
    count=0
    firstline=1
    cat $1 | while read line
    do
        if [ $firstline -eq 1 ]; then
            firstline=0
        else
            printf ","
        fi
        address=`echo $line | cut -f 1 -d " " `
        printf '{"fields": {'
        printf '"wallet_expected_btc_credit_amount": 0, "wallet_address_status": "free", "wallet_address": "'
        printf  $address
        printf '", "wallet_address_order_id": 0, "wallet_address_status_timer": "0"}, "model": "user_bitcoin.walletsmodel", "pk": '
        printf  $count
        printf '}'
        (( count = count + 1 ))
    done
    
    printf ']'
You must just call it in the next way
