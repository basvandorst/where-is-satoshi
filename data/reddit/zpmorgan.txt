This is what scares me about working with bitcoin. MtGox had their own proprietary wallet software too, didn't it? Some versions of the official software were even incompatible with earlier versions, and caused a bit of a fork on at least one occasion.

Hey :)
Why is bitcoin so popular in China now?
@_date: 2014-03-17 10:35:24
Zombo even takes Bitcoin now!
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:04:11
Nah. If I'm not mistaken, you're not responsible for testing the stuff, your own wealth isn't tied up in the thing, and the company would have limited liability and is insured perhaps. Why worry? :)

Mullvad is pretty nice, in my experience.

I thought it was "coinpportunity" :) I still registered both domain names, as well as their plural forms. Seemed like a unique coinpportunity to throw away $40.

Excellent interview. I especially liked how she pronounced Dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:50:41
Fellow dogecoin enthusiast, that's a little bit obnoxious. It comes across as blatant spam, IMO.
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:57:30
That's understandable! Thanks for considering the offer :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:41:37
How do you figure?
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:51:17
Cool... I don't see the point of the reward though. Every time I've played Go, it didn't feel like I was creating anything of value. Then again, I'm only a 9kyu.

Probably in the top 20. Why was your account locked?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:11:33
Nah. Vigilantism isn't justice. Justice would be having him work at a Starbucks for 20 years until he can afford a mobile home, and then having it be reposessed by his mortgage lender.

Maybe pywallet can delete a key. If pywallet can only delete the address though, they key might get re-used as a change address or something. It's not clear to me.

Hello, friend. What ails you so?
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:06:06
You'd have a few from me if the doge bot wasn't stalled due to some sort of fundamental flaw in the dogecoin algorithm. Or just a lot of reddit traffic.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:39:20
I don't re-use passwords, but could any hacker possibly benefit from my login credentials?
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:12:09
That's crazy talk, but dogecoin is looking pretty nice right now.
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:07:16
Ugh. This is so tempting, but the good stuff costs so much more than the not so good stuff :(
I wrote [my 2nd go server]( about a year ago, but sorta lost interest. It does toroidal games on a scrolling html canvas. It handles real-time &amp; correspondence games. It's not perfect. Want to buy it from me for 2.5 bitcoins? If you do, I'll shop at your store.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:49:59


Holy crap. I only lost $1200, but it was stuck there because of their verification requirements. Were you unable to verify &amp; withdraw?
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:55:30
Yeah, to keep litecoins offline, you need a litecoin client, like litecoin-qt. i don't believe that there are any thin clients that work for litecoin. Litecoin has an electrum, but there are apparently no electrum servers running.
The PPCoin market started about a day ago, and there was a bit of a race to get ppcoins onto the site. the first batch made it in, ppcoins were going for some outrageous prices:  
To simply speculate, you don't need a client, but i'd suggest keeping most of your coins offsite, of course :) Don't trust the troll box. Litecoins will probably rise in value when Mt. Gox starts trading them. Same with Namecoins, whenever Mt. Gox gets namecoins.
@_date: 2013-04-07 08:54:32


I've noticed this too. Gox seems consistently higher. Maybe it has something to do with the difficulty if moving USD. You could try this; I'd love to know how it works.
I'd avoid NVC &amp; TRC. Terracoin's network is screwed up from its fast difficulty adjustment, and NVC was heavily premined before it was launched.

nope, i just figured this stuff out last week. FWIW, my advice would be to learn about a bunch of different currencies, set up a bunch of buy/sell orders, and maybe to hang out in  on freenode. It's not great advice, but it's all i have.
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:38:08
are you kidding? I gained 8 btc from having a bunch of ppcoin on btc-e at the right time :) it shouldn't have happened, but it did. The gains from cryptocurrencies have been incredible lately.
