It will take time to educate and implement something like BTC in Kazahstan, cash is king in the country. We are having hard time implementing into the west because people still believe banks is a great idea.

I got a decent grip of the LN network as non-technical guy. I wonder how the frontend and the user experience will be when using LN. I tried the testnet and I think it was too complicated to even pay for a coffee. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:07:37
Anything I can read upon or being tested if its anonymize transactions. I dont care about decentralization.

Its going to be worthless to a citizen. You can hear about it here:  (SWEDISH ONLY, sry)
They are also just exploring, have not set a release date or plan.
Also we have Swish  which is super-easy-to-use and send money to each other instant.. The problem is when there is massive overload of users, it can shut down for a while. .

I 0.5.16 is my multibit version and my fee is 0.001 so I am propably fucked. I tried to import the wallet to blockchain but it keeps telling me password is wrong. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:09:10
I dont dare to send anything from my MULTIBIT wallet. Maybe my transaction disappears again. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 13:34:07
I will look into it, need to calm down abit first
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:01:37
My TX is another transaction. The transaction to my trezor is gone. I probably cant get back my money. Gonna try last to import my key to blockchain wallet. Its not encrypted not sure what im doing wrong.
@_date: 2016-01-05 05:53:34

"In Electrum 2.0, you cannot import private keys in a wallet that has a seed. You should sweep them instead." I only have export key in multibit classic I dont know what sweep means. and I tried to import the multibit classic key unencrypted into Electrum wallet it didnt let me go next
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:27:26
I did a reset on multibit wallet, and the transactions that failed is gone in my transaction tab. That transaction is before 3 dec and it is to my wallet multibit. So I should I have that amount on wallet but its gone

Got stuck with decent btc amount, I got heartattacked but I read someone lost over 65 btc. I felt a little better but I felt Bitcoin is too unstable to achieve anything for common people. Stopped promoting bitcoin to friends and loved ones recently because of this stuck transactions

What is the most exciting for you when working on Lightning? What do you think LN would be used for?
Are there any Schnorr ELI5 out there in cyberspace?
Thank you for replying.

Thank you, great tips! I saw couple of weeks ago a node that have a small lcd screen on it to show status and progress. Anyone know what Im talking about. Otherwise Bitseed seem to be a great choice

I support bitcoin as whole I see no problem with change. But I have to buy a node and set it up first in order to choose side ;p

But cant i just buy bitcoins instead? 
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:11:52
Lost 50% and possible more at price. Im not one of the lucky ones. Donot invest if you cant afford it. Bitcoins is so new that no one can predict its course and price
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:45:56
How does this work Bitcoin XBT?
Is it worth investing, im not actually buying a bitcoin im buying a tracker that tracks the price? Sounds awful but I dont understand shit.

Thanx. What do you mean by built? Is he listing companies or have founded them. Sorry on mobile phone cant fully explore his posts. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:22:09
I agree with your concern and great you brought it up.
My view: it's a safe Haven for rich people. That's why it's useful and you don't have to trust anyone except the internet you are using. It's not a currency anymore. It stopped being that when we celebrate Bitcoin Pizza day. Other than that it's also the first crypto currency in the world. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:59:21
I am sorry. I can't facebook, surf, and use app store with Bitcoin? Heloooooo? Are you crazy Daisy?!

Squarespace is great but its expensive compared what I have now. Maybe if the site goes viral we could bring in some donation and pump it up a bit in quality but that's depending what direction it takes...

Try withdraw more than 15 000 (1000dollar) SEK from YOUR account in a Swedish bank (or any bank). 
You will get a blanket to fill out and questions from the bank clerk:
What are you goin to do with the money? 
Where is the money from? 
If your answers doesnt satisfies them they start ask more questions and start whining about the risks with cash. 
It will then take them one week to order your paper money and the bank pray that you won´t pick them up and cancel the order.
After that experience I truly saw the whole picture and its scary.

Coinbase acting like bank. I tried withdraw my ETH on their GDAX site and I had to identify myself which I already did but this time I had to fill out my job title, what I am goin to do with the coins etc. Just like a bank when you try to withdraw more than 1000
