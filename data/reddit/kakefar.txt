Huge buy wall up. Drop in sell wall. Going up?
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:24:21
Seems huge to me. Any thoughts?

And we are turning. Climbing again. Happy Christmas everyone.

This had been one of the most stressful days of my life. Luckily I stayed calmed.

I agree. We have only seen the tip of the ice berg. Mark my words it is going to be a huge game changer.

Well said. It rose from 10-11 to 16. The bots ( big players) will take some profit of that and start over. Tom Lee raised his price target from 11 to 20 by mid 2018. There are a lot of investors moving to btc to make money of the extreme volatility. That do not equal a loss of interest. On the contrary it is increasing.

Happy New year ��

To me it looks like it's turning upwards, but I have been way off several times last couple of days. A coin flip is probably just as informative. Don't put in money you can't afford to loose is the only advice I can give.

It is a one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC) .

Well said. Enjoy the Holliday and don't worry too much about price. There is a huge build up of interest in btc I am sure we will look back at this as we do to the other corrections. Just a small bump on the road.

Calling out random numbers without any analysis do not contribute anything. Please don't post meaningless comments like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:05:56
You are really annoying!
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:00:10
Dont freak out guys! We have been through worse.

You are just dropping random words. What do Fibonacci have to do with a neural net? Confidence variance is not a concept, maybe you mean confidence intervals for variance? Are you doing Bayesian neural nets?or using dropout to get a estimate of prediction variance? My guess is no model just spreading FUD.

At least there's a rational. To much assumptions for me. Cherry picking one event and assuming it will happen again in the same shape is a very big assumption. I have tried it several times and failed evrytime with bitcoin. But anyway thanks for the details. Much more constructive.

I am a statestician (phd) and have been working with machine learning for a quite a while now.  Happy to discuss methods if you feel like.

Down like a clown. Lovely. Regaining some believe in cryptocurrency. Still lots of manipulation and dishonest players. Stay strong btc.

Where are those developers?
nothing after 10/22:
nothing after 07/09:
This chain actually has some, but nothing compared to btc:
Last one:
Seems like only deadalnix is commiting with some frequency.

I agree. This is just a market manipulation. 
A strong group of core developers with a vision are what makes btc so valuable. Bcash just used the work of the developers and didn't add much. 
When the hashing difficulties rises they adjust, if BTC had done that everyone would be screaming centralizing. For Bcash it's not just tolerated, they see it as a strength.
The 8mb is just a bandaid that creates more problems than it solves.
They are showing their faces though. Hope ppl will remember this.
