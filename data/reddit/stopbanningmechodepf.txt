Cash is used heavily for those purposes as well.

The "deep web"? You're a moron, please kill yourself and any offspring you may have.

good troll is not obvious troll. you obvious troll.

I think you're medically stupid. Straw man arguments aren't going to work on me today, schmuck.
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:23:10
That's retarded criticism. I believe cash is ONLY useful for illegal activities. Prove me wrong.

Don't talk like that, SHA-256 has an expiration date - the longer it is in production the more likely it is to happen. Bitcoin would adapt but it would be a hellish day/week.

Sminem powering up.
Spoofy, is it you? Please let it be true. Please.

I suppose it just feels like a genre I love is being diluted with trash. But it doesn't really matter, Weezy and those clowns existed long before this generation could smoke their clove cigarettes and tattoo their faces.

I'm in my early 30s as well and I remember drinking Robitussin and eating Dramamine to get high - but then again, it was the midwest. This generation seems to be sipping on opiate cough syrup which I guess makes sense, but who the hell can get enough cough syrup to support a habit like that? Also, dangerous habit for kids to be getting into and rappers to be promoting. With Cocaine there's no question you're fucking with danger, grape syrup that makes your tummy warm doesn't give you the same sense of caution but certainly carries the same amount of (or greater) danger.

Oh, of course, face tats.

Yeah dude, kids seem to think this is cool now.
1) Paint hair stupid colors, potentially dread.
2) Find a friend with a prescription to cough syrup.
3) Talk incoherently over shitty beats, tell people you're a rapper.
4) Profit and pussay.

# Yes. Now begin capitulation.

Honestly I only hate the fact that they call themselves "rappers". I love rap, the shit they make is a travesty.
@_date: 2018-06-05 13:10:20
No, thanks.
