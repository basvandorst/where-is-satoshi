Time for hodlers to buy back in 
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:26:26
Yes.  Think about the altcoins to buy though, don’t just invest because they’re low.  Keep a primary position in BTC though
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:06:52
You need to spend some time reading up on what the fundamentals behind all of this are.  You sound like you’re going off a whim given by your friend.  Learn to deal with BTC and altcoins and appropriate a portfolio accordingly.

What fee do I choose to move from Electrum to Nano Ledger S?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:23:11
The thing people are failing to see is this is still earliest of adoptions.  We are still among the first 1-2% of people who are kicking this off.  To the moon with this still and a correction is just a flash in the pan at this stage.  Just by nature of where we are in this lifecycle
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:28:17
Truth 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:31:26
Want to move some BTC from Electrum to Ledger, what fee should I be picking?  If I slide it to the left as 0 it says Replaceable, what does that mean?  There are options up to 1434 sat/byte.

What’s the best way of buying Ripple when all I have is a holding on Coinbase?  I assume GDAX only deals in the usual three...
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:46:24
Agreed that Electrum is a good interim store away from Coinbase.  When things get serious buy a Nano Ledger S and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:33:27
Is transferring BTC from Electrum to Nano Ledger S easy?  Any pointers?
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:45:40
Electrum all day
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:19:27
He did and it’s down to us lot in 20XX to find ours.  Mine is 3/4 mortgage 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:29:05
Doubled my money even now but it’s all sitting in Electrum.  What’s the best course of action to realise some profit in terms of moving money mechanics 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:15:24
Investing some cash in:-ETH -XRP-LTC-Dash-NEO 
All of these bar XRP are offered by Nano Ledger S so had a bearing on my choice.  
What do you think the ratios on investment should be??
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:18:13
Can someone explain the BTC v Bitcash feud as I (and many others) are out of the loop

Only those who had it at the time it forked a while back.  Great time for those guys to hold and sell due to this publicity on Coinbase.  Awful decision by Coinbase on this as the shitcoin offers very little.  I think this will make Roger Ver very very happy unfortunately as it’s even labelled Bitcoin Cash which will mislead people into thinking its Bitcoin.  They should of course emphasised as BCash to piss him off.  What a shambles 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:33:47
What is the message here?  Things to stabilise or go up?

Luckily my boss and I get on well and we regularly spend an hour at work gossiping about the current trend

All bar NEO from Poloniex 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:23:21
I sold everything I had at the highs and then bought back a bit back into the rise.  Am I pathetic?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:08:33
However long it takes to verify.  The bigger the fee the quicker the transfer. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:09:32
So they now raise their head above the parapet...things are starting to get juicy now 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:17:51

@_date: 2017-12-13 00:40:52
So we know amazon bought out s few addresses relating to crypto.  What’s stopping them designing their own crypto using the learnings of BTC and where would that leave BTC price

What is the mechanism they used to work out how much BCH I got today?

Binance works for non US?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:58:08
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:57:38
Why hold when you can sell for profit and then buy at a lower price with the profit for more BTC
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:04:27
Also, what's stopping countries/governments accepting that Bitcoin is a good idea, then proceed make their own and send Bitcoin to the dogs?  
Seems like I'm hodling to promote the Blockchain principles underpinning BTC raising it's profile only for a country to realise it works - steal the idea (principally) and disregard BTC for their own made cryptocurrency.
This kind of outlook makes the short term game BTC has promoted more profit orientated rather than a demonstration of how crypto will work in the future and crucially the profitability of BTC in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:26:08
Agreed although I will buy in and hopefully when that does inevitably happen I’ll have enough capital to buy my desired amount.  After that it’s fine that it goes to the moon 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:15:05
This is quite a well known fact about crypto.  I was asking for some sort of technical analysis as to why behaviour has caused it to move this way...every dip (such as this) has a reason and not just put it down to “usual volatility”
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:50:59
I know what it is but it should be in that hodl folder 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:59:24
Note that you may have difficulty with securing protection on the account though so worth thinking about that e.g. 2FA

What’s the best app to track crypto fluctuations/graphs/charts etc?
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:07:51
I find a shift away more so from what you propose.  People place value in the here and now and will walk over anything to get a product that is better than the previous.  I hope BTC solidifies a market lead in crypto by something other than popularity and first leader advantage because the blockchain and other ideals it’s built on are easily transposable on another competing crypto platform - enter stage right Amazon crypto
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:15:55

What’s your investment level?  
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:34:01
Not heard of anyone paying anything considerable just yet.  I think the HMRC will do something similar to what the IRS did by asking exchanges like Coinbase to submit their customers who have bought / sold significant amounts and then tax those.  In time everyone will end up paying the government.  It’s capital gains after all and don’t think taking your original investment out is not subject to tax because it’s considered as the gain.  Sucks.

What’s the purpose of the code?  I’ve been able to buy BTC from my phone using my a coinbase account and tend to buy and transfer to Electrum anyway as that’s proper storage.  My aim is to transfer to Ledger Nano S in the long run.

First day in AGES when this has been really boring
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:51:16
What exactly is a private key?  I mean on Electrum I know I have a 12 word seed which when twinned with a password (is this a private key) produces my BTC on the home screen 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:17:21
All the very best.  Prayers go out to you

@_date: 2017-12-22 16:16:25

@_date: 2017-12-27 03:05:51
And then withdraw back to my Electrum receive address? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:44:31

@_date: 2017-12-09 23:52:55

@_date: 2017-12-26 01:58:50
I did the same from GDAX and was still waiting after an hour 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:15:57
Sell it on Coinbase for high fees or transfer to GDAX and withdraw for little/no fees

I’ve got 100% of my fiat in BTC and have made some good money from it.  
I’m looking at diversifying my profit into altcoins and keeping prominence in BTC.  What are your thoughts?  
My strategy would be siphoning investment into the following, all of these are regarded as “safe” and are consistent in the top 10:
My main worry is taking my stake out of the BTC and sacrificing gains in the long run over 2018.  
My end goal is to keep a significant amount in BTC whilst maintaining my coins and hodling for the long run.
TLDR should I diversify out or keep all my BTC in one place and hodl to the moon?
Ps - where do you hold altcoins that are not supported by Nano Ledger S as cold storage?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:17:08
Explain why you wouldn’t sell at the current price and realise your profits.  Extract your original investment, add all of it up again and enter back into the market when BTC falls allowing you to buy a greater share of BTC the next time round 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:38:25
Not even close to 10k yet

For this reason I am all in on BTC only 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:56:24
In order to trade on GDAX I need to transfer to GBP wallet and then deposit into GDAX but this will incur fees.  First time trading so is it normal to just go ahead and trade in BTC as it looks a lot less natural than a GBP value 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:41:02
Can we please see some movement on BTC.  I swear that all the other coins feel like they need to move to be noticed now 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:05:11
This is what has me worried.  There’s so many other companies out there Amazon, Google etc. who have showed initiative in the crypto market .  Again, whose to say someone else learns from BTC and adds to their model improving any flaws and produces a crypto which is better.  I’m still yet to get a concrete answer on why BTC would remain influential with a high value worth.  I can see this happening regardless of how much first mover advantage, incumbent, the face of crypto Bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:20:33
Is this UK too?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:38:45
I don’t get this statement.  How is it valuable to the Bitcoin ecosystem if the word is spread on hodling whilst claiming it is a store of value?  Surely it’s a store of value if it’s examined by buying goods with it...regularly. 
Sounds to me like holding, reducing supply and increasing price artificially based on hype is what’s happening at the moment.

Guys is there any disadvantage to taking out my original investment (made decent gains in the last 4 months) keeping my profits in and waiting for the dip with my original investment?
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:37:31
All of this is true.  Barring a total meltdown BTC will continue to rise and even if there is a 1k - 2k tank after you buy rest assured in the long run you will recoup and more.  That’s the investment attitude for you to stop thinking in thousands and promote thinking about the proposed hundreds of thousands.  The trick is to project this model out by 5 - 10 years

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:17:09
Why are more people not selling all their BTC now and taking the profit, timing the dip (which is any time now really) and buying back in.  This returns investment and more plus allows you to buy in at a better rate...
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:12:59
It’ll be back to BTC today.  A few whales dictated LTC today 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:57:26
Is there something I can relate to this thinking currently?  An asset which does nothing but sit there and appreciate due to others using its values...seems pretty unlikely 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:01:09
This was my original thought as Ripple seemed the only one that went opposite BTC also shown to be the case when BTC went reeling and Ripple remained up
Ethereum is also one I would consider since it’s providing infrastructure as opposed to product
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:28:18
I’m talking about Coinbase above.  Coinbase has no 12 word back up...
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:31:43
Let’s face a fact here.  I’m in danger of losing my original investment here so it makes rational sense to withdraw my original investment plus a bit of profit and wait until the dip materialises further to the point where I would’ve broken even.  At that point (or below) I will invest again and this time I could still use the same amount I’ve withdrawn to buy a larger amount of BTC ready for the next bull run

Is 0.6 enough of a BTC to be rich boys?

I might just rename the wallet to something else in v3, type in my seed and be done with it.

But mine is called default wallet.  Can I just go ahead and click yes to confirm or should I just use v2.9.2 as when I initially transferred?

I'm newish to this and yes you're right.  But at some point the coin produced by a country will 'work' and that'll be the end of BTC.  
Other countries will follow suit and the new crypto protocol will replace fiat with BTC being the pioneering technology and knowledge base that provided it.  In terms of monetary value it will be reduced to nothing.
