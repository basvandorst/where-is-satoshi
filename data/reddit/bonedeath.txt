Except 1. There are plenty of married couples that reap benefits who have no intention of breeding 2. LGBT couples can adopt and raise a child 3. I wish you personally had to get a license to breed cause your ignorance is outstanding and this type of thinking just holds humanity back. Hopefully you understand this, but somehow, I fucking doubt it.

Nah man, let's just list how Rand Paul isn't Odrama. This is for circlejerkers that hate Odrama. Without him Rand Paul's "list of reasons to Vote for Rand Paul" shrinks dramatically. Against raising minimum wage, against pro choice (and not just a little bit, he wants a federal ban on abortion), no universal healthcare, no same sex marriage, no stem cell research, voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (not once but twice and stated that he wanted it to include religious exemptions - way to separate church and state), and thinks vaccines cause mental disorders.. even though his campaign couldn't provide a single shred of evidence to support his statement. Sure, Rand Paul has some good points but there's just as much shit following him. Rand Paul will be about as prolific in this race as Ron Paul and I'm grateful for that. Follow in daddy's foot steps Rand, be a 30 year running candidate.

Exactly so even worse, he wants to overturn Roe v. Wade to instill his own religious beliefs unto the country.  
As for same-sex marriage


Rand Paul does not endorse same-sex marriage, but he supports marriage contracts for same-sex couples.[41] He stated: "You could have both traditional marriage, which I believe in. And then you could also have the neutrality of the law that allows people to have contracts with another."[42] Paul's staffers say he believes the issue should be left to the states to decide.[43][44] He has said he thought that the Supreme Court's ruling in Windsor v. United States, which struck down the portion of the Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage at a federal level (as between a man and a woman), was appropriate.[45]
So some semantic work around so that he can be the god-fearing politician he plans on being. I appreciate the "open-minded approach" I suppose but, it comes off as bullshit, like he doesn't wanna step on toes.. Let's call it like it is, he doesn't endorse same-sex marriage. 




The Christian Coalition voter guide [is] one of the most powerful tools Christians have ever had to impact our society during elections. This simple tool has helped educate tens of millions of citizens across this nation as to where candidates for public office stand on key faith and family issues.
The CC survey summarizes candidate stances on the following topic: "Federal Marriage Amendment to prevent same sex marriage"

I also don't know why you linked me to the CDC. No-one is saying vaccines have to be administered immediately and any pediatrician in their right mind will know proper procedure, these points are moot and as far as I know are not linked to the vaccines but to being improperly administered (ie: given to children with auto immune disease, too young, during sickness, etc). Rand Paul made the statement that yes, AFTER VACCINATION, there were mental disorders. There's no reason to say that unless you believe there is a link to mental disorders and vaccination. If the sentence was "It's a shame that after children ate ice cream there've been cases of retardation." How can you argue that he doesn't believe the ice cream made the kids retarded?

AI/automation are a larger threat to the middle class than immigrants can ever be. But, people don't think that's a reality. Just wait though, there will have to be some sort of Universal income because computers/robots don't need breaks, health insurance, worker's rights, etc etc. Sure, it might not be on the next ten years, but it's closer than people think. I've been a welder for the past ten years and automation in the industry is at an all time high.

You realize a republic derives from democracies, including other power sources, for better or worse. Honestly though, the US is more Oligarchy moving into Corporatocracy than it is a "Republic" the forefathers imagined.

Tough predicament I suppose. Was probably an ode to those who know who/what DRP is. Essentially pissing off that community unfortunately. But I'd wager 90% of people put no significance to the DRP name.

Overpriced is the only one I agree with for me. The theater experience in Austin, TX (alamo drafthouse, violet crown, moviehouse) are generally pretty good clean, quite experiences. They don't put up with people talking/texting and get booted immediately. I still don't go on the regular but when I do it's pretty good.

that thing's riddled with bugs, I couldn't connect to any of their servers from their own client. no error, no changed settings, just one day wouldn't connect (client was updated, installed it on my main machine too and would work fine) - I switched over to OpenVPN and no problems since. not that it'd change anything, but if the VPN supports OpenVPN I'd be more inclined to use that client than any proprietary software they give you.
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:24:06
Probably unrelated but were you using the PIA client or OpenVPN?
