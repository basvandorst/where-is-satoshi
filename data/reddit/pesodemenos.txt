I bought at $300, $2000, $4000, $7000 and $12000 so no real lost yet, always holding and buying more when my Paypal account have enough money. I work with graphic design and social media, so Bitcoin is just a "hobbie", and also I believe in cryptocurrencies, so if this continue falling I really don't care lol.

I don't know why so many downvotes. Remember the video months ago when we were broking again the $10k wall? "I can feeling ir pumping in the air tonight"? After that Bitcoin just keep going down, we're still in bears, don't  be optimistic so early.

I never sold. I was buying Bitcoin at $300, $1000, $3000, $7000 and $12000 (before 20k dump). Not selling at least it broke $50k.
