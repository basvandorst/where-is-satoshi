There is a big difference between eclair (desktop) and eclair-wallet (mobile) even if they share the same codebase. On mobile you can only send, not receive, payments with LN, whereas on desktop you can send/receive/forward payments. The rationale was explained [here](
This means that on mobile, it is not really a big deal if you don't always watch the blockchain, or if you watch it in a not-so-trustless manner (which is the case when you rely on electrum servers (*)). But on desktop, as soon as you receive/forward funds through LN, you must have a way to reliably and trustlessly watch the blockchain, otherwise your counterparties could cheat you out of funds. The best way to do that is to rely on a bitcoin full node; in the future there will be other options (such as 3rd party watchers).
(*) Mostly because our electrum client is currently ultra-simplistic, only connects to one server at a time and doesn't even check blockchain headers. If we did all that it could be deemed acceptable, but would still be inferior to a full node. And our plan A for light client is neutrino anyway.

Eclair Node (windows/macos/linux) and Eclair Wallet (android) are different softwares that rely on the same core library.
0.2.3 is indeed the last version of Eclair Wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:15:45
That would certainly be possible, but we have no immediate plans for that. Eclair is first and foremost a complete implementation of a Lightning node, everything related to wallet management is currently delegated to bitcoin core.
The mobile app has a different angle and does have an embedded wallet, that's why its name is Eclair Wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:14:55
That's not accurate: zap and lightning desktop are indeed UIs that connect to an (lnd) node, but eclair is a node that happens to include a GUI (just like bitcoin core). Functionally eclair, lnd, c-lightning are similar.
Eclair-wallet is an Android app, it is also a standalone node (yet limited for now: can't receive or forward funds).
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:38:39
I can vouch for he has been around for quite some time and has contributed to eclair several times.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:35:17
is right that eclair wallet (the android app) does only support one-way channels for now, as opposed to the regular eclair node (which runs on desktop/server) which has full capability. The rationale was explained [here](
For this reason, channels created by eclair-wallet are not announced, so there are actually far more channels and nodes than what the explorer displays. And it's impossible to know the numbers ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:14:43
you can test our eclair-wallet android app
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:12:58


You need to have enough money to pay for network fees when you open a channel, so if you have 100 mBTC try opening a channel for a little less than that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:10:30
Hi, eclair developer here. Nice guide! But note that electrum support is still experimental, and we highly recommend using bitcoin-core instead when running a desktop node. It is not much more complicated to setup, and would be a lot more secure on mainnet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:13:36
eclair runs on desktop/server (windows macos linux)
eclair-wallet runs on android
they rely on the same eclair-core library
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:30:45
This. Please try to break things!
All feedback is welcome but crash/loss of funds is what we really are after atm.
If you are using eclair wallet (android), a nice thing to do is write down what funds you started with, and make sure you didn't lose a penny after having open/closed channels, sent payments off chain and sent/received payments on chain.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:41:59
The eclair wallet app (on android) can't yet receive payments, only send.
But the regular [eclair node]( which runs on desktop/server is a full fledge LN implementation, capable of sending/relaying/receiving payments, just like [c-lightning]( or [lnd](
eg: starblocks actually runs eclair to receive payments :-)
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:18:28
there is currently no known issues running eclair on windows
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:08:47
Channel announcements are signed by both parties, so they need to agree, one party can't unilaterally announce the channel.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:10:34
Actually I somehow missed the fact that you were also installing an electrum client. It is not needed, as eclair connects to electrum servers and manages a wallet itself.
Note that we plan to remove electrum support on the desktop node soon. We were not expecting people to use it and it may lead to loss of funds on mainnet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:33:58
For eclair:
- if you need a quick help, ask a question on our [gitter](
- if you think you found a bug, open a new issue on our [github]( with as much details/data as possible
Happy testing!
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:25:10
yes you can, just scan or paste a regular bitcoin address instead of a LN payment request
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:15:16
Running a Lightning node requires the ability to reliably monitor the blockchain. The best way to do that trustlessly is to run a full bitcoin node.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:13:40
Yes you can run an eclair node on windows, linux, or macos.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:01:46
Indeed we found a bug that caused payments to get stuck in PENDING state, we're fixing it. That's why testing is so important, if you run into any bugs please let us know !
@_date: 2018-05-08 16:08:14
It does look like the PoS is a little laggy. It should acknowledge the payment *before* the mobile wallet, in about half the time actually.
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:57:42


No they can't. Channel capacities are public, but balances are only known to the two participants of each channel. Only when a channel is closed will a tx be published, that sends their respective funds to Alice and Bob.
This is somewhat underappreciated, but LN brings a lot of improvements wrt privacy when compared to on-chain payments.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:22:59


What onion routing does is it prevents intermediate nodes from learning the origin and destination of a payment, it doesn't really help with DOS attacks.
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:35:37
NB: this video is from a previous version of Eclair, before the BOLTs. At that time Eclair &amp; lightningd were compatible, but the compatibility broke when we all reworked our implementations to match the new standard.
Hopefully we will be able to do a new version of this video with Eclair, lightningd, lnd, soon! 
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:22:03
We will look into it. Note that this is not an issue if you initiate channels though, in that case your public ip doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:05:11
You are mistaking the *bad* and the *ugly* way of tearing down a channel, as described in [BOLT 5]( (just see the abstract).
Nodes get punished only when they actively try to cheat. In case a node just becomes unreachable, the counterparty may just decide to unilaterally close the channel, meaning that the last state will be published to the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:35:52


Connections are established only when you open a channel. Note that once a channel is open its duration is independent of the particular connection it was opened in. It is demonstrated in the video when a node is killed, then restarted, and the channel is still there. You may also close a channel even when the other not is not reachable, that's called an unilateral close in LN speak.


As a node operator, you will have complete control over what channel you create or how many channels others can create with you. Whether some or all of this process is automated or not will depend solely on the implementation.
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:46:51




Yes, we use source routing, so sending node calculates the path. This path is then onion-encrypted, meaning that an intermediate node doesn't know the origin and the destination of the payment, just the immediate node before and after it in the route. See [BOLT  for details.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:37:12
Hi, this is Pierre from ACINQ.


3 blocks are required to establish the channel (this is configurable and specific to our example). 6 blocks are required before the channel can be announced -and used by others- on the network (this is a constant value defined in the [BOLTs](


It is currently [hardcoded (fee-base-msat,  fee-proportional-millionth)]( Don't try to make sense of the values, there are totally arbitrary at this point. You can override the values in eclair.conf (see the [readme](


They could! but the whole point of LN is that A don't have to connect to C directly, because the relaying fees paid to B will be order of magnitudes less than network fees paid to the bitcoin network to setup a new channel A-C.


Of course, you can try out any topology you want. We just showed the most basic one.
edit 1: syntax
edit 2: added link to readme
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:12:43




If that was the only channel you had, you can't send/receive payments anymore. That's the reason why you will probably have a handful of open channels at any time.


Of course, like everything that is reachable online (same goes for a publicly accessible bitcoin node). That will push towards decentralization.
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:43:35
You must have activated the mining feature? Just kidding ;-)
Feel free to file an issue [here]( with as much information about your environment, eclair.log as possible. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:40:54
Yes and what's special about Eclair, ligthningd, lit and lnd is that they all are in the process of implementing the [BOLT standard]( so they will be fully compatible.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:40:07
Oh, I see your point. But with outsourcing of channels monitoring it is extremely risky to do so, because even if A is completely nuked, you may very well be punished by one or multiple third parties on behalf of A :-)
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:15:23


Correct, we call that a *unilateral close*
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:48:49
Nodes announce themselves on LN using [node announcements]( If your node's public ip change, you should publish an updated announcements with the new ip.
In the current version of eclair you would have to restart it after redefining eclair.server.public-ip parameter in the configuration file.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:08:07
Unilateral/Uncooperative close that *you* publish have a 144-block (1-day) delay with eclair current settings. If the counterparty does it, there is no delay for you.
A 30-days delay is definitely not normal. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:34:00
To be sure, did you (1) swipe to the right, (2) select your LN channel, and (3) hit "Close Channel"?
On the main screen (Transaction History), you should see an incoming on-chain transaction.
There hasn't been any bug reports related to this so far, and that would be a pretty serious bug. Please let us know if you confirm/reproduce this bug.
Note that if the channel you were attempting to close wasn't in NORMAL state, the refund will take 144 blocks, but a specific warning message is displayed in that case, telling you that you are about to perform an uncooperative close.
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:19:28


It does, actually! Routing is implemented, and eclair wallet can connect to any node, not just ours. You can run an eclair node yourself and route payment through them. Some users did just that, and sent money to each other.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:14:14


I think the way we did the demo has been misleading to many, but there is no such limitation! Eclair wallet is a full LN implementation, it allows you to make a 20-hops payment today and it has been the case from day 1. In fact even when you use eclair wallet to pay a starblocks coffee, you actually make a one-hop payment through one of our test nodes.Some users installed eclair node and successfully sent funds to each other. You can try yourself :-)
That being said, the main goal was to show users how they could manage channels, and from this pov I think the demo fulfilled its goal.
Another way to look at it would be that routing is so seamless most didn't even notice it was there? ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:22:43
The only signed tx that starblocks has corresponds to the current state of the channel. So in your example the tx would send 20$ to you and 0$ to starbucks. The money stays yours.
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:36:46
When you open the channel, the $20 are actually locked in a 2of2 multisig tx between you and starbucks, that is published on the blockchain. You also have a commitment tx that sends $20 back to you, but you don't publish this one.
You can't just update the commitment tx by yourself, because it spends a 2of2. Instead, you cooperate with the other party, and during that process you also revoke the previous commitment by revealing a secret. Once this is done, you can't publish the revoked tx anymore, because the secret you revealed would allow the counterparty to take all the funds. So effectively you now have $19 and they have $1.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:28:34
What you are saying is true, but you are describing "unilateral closes" that should remain the exception.
Most of the time, parties will agree on a "mutual close" with no timeouts, and a lower tx fee.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:20:15


That's a good question. There is a specific message (see 'update_fee' in BOLT  which will allow you to update the fee of the commitment tx on reconnection. The thing to keep in mind is it is in both parties best interest to keep their commitment tx publishable at all time. Also, it is even more interesting for them to cooperate on a mutual close (which has a smaller tx), for which there is a specific fee negotiation.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:08:46
Also please go to the top right menu &gt; Network Overview and give me the Block count, that could help.
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:29:59
Hi, you are wrong ;-) Current LN spec allows for up to 20 hops, and this is fully implemented in eclair (that I can tell for sure) and I am almost certain it is in lnd and c-lightning too. There is absolutely no limitation to 2-path routes or centralized hub. You can make a 20-hop payment from your android phone with eclair wallet today.
As for channels going offline, this is also fully supported, see BOLT 7 ('disable' flag) and BOLT 4 (temporary channel failures). Any BOLT compliant implementation will just route around the failing channel.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:02:00
That might be a bug. Please go the channels view, select this channel and give me the Id/Remote node id/Transaction Id, I'll look into it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:17:43


You don't need to open a channel directly with Starbucks, because payments can be routed through up to 20 nodes. If you installed eclair wallet and opened a channel using autoconnect, you actually opened a channel with a gateway node exactly like you described. Any coffee purchase were sent thrgough this node to the starblocks node. We expect that you will be connected to a handful of nodes at all time, which would allow you to make payments to anyone.


I am not sure what you mean by that? Yes, before being able to use LN, you need to join the network, and this requires an on-chain tx. You are effectively opting in to a payment network that will save you fees later. And without LN, any payment requires an on-chain tx right?
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:48:03
Hi, best place to get help is our [gitter](
Note that by default eclair connects with user=foo and pass=bar
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:23:28
Eclair is actually not newer (first commit in aug 2015), and with ~1.5k downloads of [eclair wallet for android]( we may have the largest user base ;-)
No implementation is passing 100% of integration tests, some interop tests are still failing (possibly because of issues in the tests themselves)
@_date: 2016-09-28 14:01:22
Hello, this is Pierre-Marie from ACINQ. The title is incorrect: Bitfury didn't do the test, my company did. We independently implemented and tested the Flare algorithm, which was published by Bitfury in july.
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:56:48
Hi, please see the original test report on the dev mailing list. You will find answers to your questions, as well as details on parameters such as the graph topology used.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:26:27
[Eclair]( is actually a full lightning node implementation, just like c-lightning or lnd.
Eclair Wallet is an android app derived from it.
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:29:10
If  doesn't resolve it means that your setup isn't correct. Did you double check the ip address of our DNS server? Please go to our gitter and we'll be able to provide detailed support. So far everybody has been able to recover their funds.


Unfortunately not, the seed only protects the on-chain wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:52:56


Nope, eclair wallet is a real lightning node, no trusted arbiter is involved and you can connect to any Lightning Node, not only ours.
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:45:21
This is the correct answer
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:06:50
Indeed, Eclair Wallet hasn't had any updates in more than a week, the network is just getting more reliable
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:00:04
Not when your wallet is spend only (which is the case of Eclair Wallet): if your counterparty publishes an older state, it will always be in your favor.
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:51:24
eclair wallet *is* a lightning node, see the [FAQ]( for more info
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:46:40
Actually the wallet *is* a node, albeit a limited one that can only send.
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:49:14
Hi, that's a [bug]( we are fixing it ASAP
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:34:31
How about if you try a new payment altogether?
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:21:37
It should adapt to your locale. Screenshot has been made on a french device :-)
@_date: 2017-07-21 22:04:32
In the lightning channels section, hit plus and select autoconnect.
The scanning feature in the lightning channels section is for swiping node URIs.
Once you have a channel open, you want to scan the payment request from the main screen "scan a request"
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:14:44
Did you wait for the channel to reach NORMAL state?
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:16:17
Hi! we 've found a bug :-) can you retry see what happens?
To retry a PENDING payment:
1) select the tx on the home screen
2) copy the 'Payment request' field (lntb[...])
3) go back to the home screen, hit the send button and slect 'Paste a request'
@_date: 2017-07-21 22:02:07
When you decide to, by selecting it and clicking Close. You'll then see an incoming onchain transaction. Otherwise it can live indefinitely
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:56:21
This is a consequence of the aforementioned bug. You need to have at least one channel in NORMAL state before being able to make a payment.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:27:23
This means that the onchain transaction that is funding your newly created channel hasn't reached 2 confirmations yet. On Testnet interval between blocks is not as predictable as on mainnet
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:20:21
We just went the easiest way and wanted to make it work first.
It might be possible to reduce the version requirements, we'll look into it!
