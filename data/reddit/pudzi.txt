At this point all I want to know is when are they going to enable withdrawals again. They can shove the "zero fees until the end of January" up their a$$es.

I find it very odd that they are shutting down the lawsuit because they didn't get "enough donations". Were they expecting to get a zillion bitcoins in just a couple of days?   It feels like something fishy is going on...

It's only happening on a few timeframes.  If you look at the x axis you'll see that it's outdated.

The last time I heard about a country trying to use UBI was Finland: 
Didn't work. In the end they always find the same excuses just like failed communism: "Not well implemented", "More time was needed". Classic.

I didn't say UUBI == communism. I said that they both get the same kind of excuses for failure. I'm not interested in starting a war on this topic. You probably heard about that "socialism experiment" story and even though it may be fake the conclusions seem obvious:
- What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving (in the end it's always funded by tax payers).
- You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it.
I never heard about those experiments in the US, but the Finland case (one of the most developed countries in the world) failed and even Switzerland completely rejected the idea of creating a UUBI via referendum.

That is not true. I work for a company that pays via bitcoin. And I'm talking about a real salary, not some variable income.
