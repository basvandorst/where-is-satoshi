For future reference, its generally a bad idea to store Bitcoins on services like Mt. Gox for reasons just like this. Either store it on some site with some degree of security, like IP change notification or the like, or enable 2FA, or just use a normal  Bitcoin wallet on your own computer. Gox is intended for trading coins, not for storing them.

Unless you are going to purchase super high-end mining equipment like 1TH+, you're going to end up losing money. This is because of the extreme competitiveness in the field right now. Difficulty is literally doubling each month. That means, if you order a rig now, and you're going to be earning, say, 1 BTC / day, and it takes a month to ship (REALLY fast by these company's standards), you're really only going to be getting 0.5 BTC / day. And then, by the end of that month, you're only going to be getting 0.25 BTC /day. It drops off fast. Unless you can easily flip your hardware and break even after the first 1 or 2 months, you're likely going to be losing money.

Exactly, the technology behind SSL is imperfect.

What are you asking for? Just answers to your questions, or more questions to ask for more $0.50s? 
Do you need a program to track it? - You either will need a program, or a web wallet, to store your Bitcoins. If you want to run a program, I recommend electrum.org. If you want a web wallet, it depends on your preferences. If you want high-security feature-rich but a bit hard to use, try blockchain.info. If you want something a little bit more intuitive, try coinbase.com, inputs.io, or cloud-coin.com. 
Do you need to sign up somewhere? Only if you use a web-wallet. In which case you'll either need to sign up at blockchain.info, inputs.io, cloud-coin.com or coinbase.com.
How do you maintain it? You don't need to maintain it. If you use a web-wallet, you just need to remember your username and password (especially for blockchain.info - if you forget your username or password, there is no way of restoring it). If you use a program, you need to remember your wallet seed (in case your hard drive gets wiped out for some reason) and need to make sure that nobody else gets your wallet seed.

It gets it from somebody else that wants to sell their BTC for USD.
Since there are in general fewer of those than people in your situation, bitstamp's system drives up the price to compensate for the imbalance.
Think of it like a two-way auction. Buyers bid the price up, while sellers bid the price down.

I believe that each new asic will find ways of being marginally more efficient than the last, and ASICs only cost a few bucks to manufacture, its the development that's expensive. As such, the major limiting factor to growth in the ASICs will be the price of electricity relative to the price of Bitcoin, not the price of the ASICs themselves.  
The price of Bitcoin is liable to increase exponentially, and during the dips, miners tend not to turn off their computers. As such I expect the number of miners to increase exponentially as well, especially considering at least minor improvements will be made to the power consumption of each successive mining rig. 
@_date: 2013-10-05 23:47:49
Woops, mybad, I noobed. Sorry.
@_date: 2013-10-05 23:05:58
Ok, no. 
People just like you trade on their system. You say, I want to buy BTC. Then it goes around and looks for other people on their system that want to sell BTC for the same price (or cheaper). If it can't find any, then it raises the price a bit, and tries again. This process is repeated until finally somebody is willing to sell their coins.
Since there are a lot of people buying and selling coins, and since there is something called a "limit" order (essentially, "I'll sell my coins, but only once the price goes over this amount") eventually it finds a seller. Since its system does all these checks super-fast (they're just database queries, after all) it can find you a seller super fast. If, theoretically, for whatever reason nobody wanted to sell BTC all of a sudden, for any price, then the price on Bitstamp would start skyrocketing to infinity as it keeps on checking for sellers at various prices and it can't find any. 
You can view the limit orders through the order book, which is available here:  I know its sort of complicated, but you have to understand that Bitstamp itself doesn't either sell or buy bitcoins at all. It doesn't have any reserves (except to pay its employees, etc...). It simply matches buyers and sellers through its orderbook.

Exactly. A lot of people figure that they can basically "exchange" from USD to BTC a lot more efficiently mining, and they sort of can, it just takes time. An actual ROI from the process of mining itself isn't what they're looking for, just the obtaining of Bitcoins.

Not really. I mean, anybody can see where those Bitcoins are coming from. The question is, where are they going to? If people can tack those Bitcoins to any single exchange there would be a ginormous sell-off there (just that exchange), not to mention the normal "protesters" and likely a DDOS. The FBI would be lucky to get a fraction of what those BTC are actually worth, especially if people know where they are selling. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 18:26:57
Except it is the attitude, and it works. It just takes a while. Think of it this way: Even if you dispute in dollar terms it is profitable, it is surely profitable in BTC terms. As such, you can think of the dollars spent on purchasing the hardware, and purchasing the electricity, as the money that you would otherwise be wiring to Gox. Taking this into account, I know some people who have gotten some super sweet "exchange rates" doing this, compared to the Goxxian price. The trick is you always have to re-sell your mining equipment to recoup your costs immediately after a new wave of more cost-efficient products come out, preferably for Bitcoin, so you can use those Bitcoins along with the last bit of mining profits to "roll-over" into more efficient equipment. Its absolutely necessary to continue this process to become profitable. If you just buy one piece of mining equipment and expect to just mine with it and return profit, it won't work. 
@_date: 2013-10-05 23:25:03
No, it can only find buy/sell offers on Bitstamp itself. Bitstamp does offer an API, so there are various ways to try to make a similar cross-platform orderbook. One such service can be found at Bitfinex (which combines Bitstamp's orderbook with its own), and another service is Bitcoin Charts Pro (which tries to combine the orderbooks of all major exchanges).
Coinbases' orderbook is "closed", though (i.e, they don't make it public) so unfortunately nobody is able to include those orders. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 03:44:10

Just to clarify the orderbook page, the "bids" are the "buy orders". Asks are "sell orders". 
Bitstamp isn't the only one to do this, all Bitcoin exchanges (as well as stock exchanges, etc...) do this, however some of them (e.g, Coinbase) don't make their orderbook public.

What does "anonymously deposit Bitcoins" mean?

Personally, I see no reason to be anonymous while purchasing bitcoins. Just purchase the coins normally, then launder the coins in any of a variety of methods, then spend the coins on whatever, or just save them. 
If you really have to anonymously exchange to BTC (I have no idea why this would be necessary...), then if you are outside of the US use BTC-E, and if you are inside the US, try to just go under the limits imposed by the various exchangers here.

Yea, for some reason only MINERS (read: the people who already know about Bitcoin) will become interested in it. 
Look, I'm not putting down miners or anything, they provide a valuable service to Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is about much more than miners. The next phase of Bitcoin won't revolve around miners, its going to revolve around businesses that use bitcoin. And the media attention isn't talking about miners, its talking about businesses that use Bitcoin, hence attracting people to think about Bitcoin not in the context of mining, but in the context of using them for business transactions. Which is what will ultimately make Bitcoin a success. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 17:57:12

Well, maybe if people like them weren't constantly running their old models, the new models wouldn't become outdated so fast? And if the old models weren't profitable, then why would people continue running them? 
That's just the way it works, and its why Bitcoin is a self-sustaining system that rewards for remaining with it and that you can't drop without taking a massive hit to your revenue stream. Every time you sell old mining equipment to someone, its still likely profitable over electricity costs. So after they work it some, they re-sell it even further downstream, to a person that has an even smaller principal but is willing to wait even longer for their investment to become profitable, and rolls their investment up a tier, so as to slowly become more profitable. 
As such, people purchasing an older tier of equipment make the smallest investment but have very limited profits, not enough to cover the initial price of the mining equipment. So they take their mining equipment, and re-sell it, along with any profits, to "level up" into a new tier of mining equipment. This process continues until you are on the final tier, the highest-level mining equipment, at which point you are finally profitable. The  rest of the time, you weren't losing money, but simply working up your principal to the point at which you could finally afford profitable equipment. So no, the people aren't getting "screwed" they are just getting started. This process can continue so long as the next wave of equipment is exponentially efficient (either with regards to price, or with regards to energy consumption) than the last, which can easily continue for many years to come.

You don't have to file anything on your taxes, practically speaking.
If you're investing a large amount of money, use Bitstamp.

Coinbase is of all of these the easiest, but gives marginally sub-optimal pricing.

Dude you're trolling so bad right now. Why do people want banks to make their 'legitimate' transactions? Because banks are the only way of moving money. Sure, you can use cash, but that's unsecure and vastly inconvenient, and can't be used to send long-distance transfers. With Bitcoin you can do anonymous transactions without ever physically meeting, or physically mailing anything. Also, Bitcoins can be laundered more effectively than anything ever.

Basically if for whatever reason you own something along the lines of a pawn shop or check cashing place, I can see that adding some Bitcoin support in one form or another could potentially work out very well for really quite a small amount of additional investment required. If you're just going to service Bitcoiners, though, I highly doubt this business would be profitable enough to cover rent. 
Another thing you'd have to consider is that technically this would be illegal as you are a money transmitter by FinCen's definition. Whether or not you'd have to register in your state is dubious, however you'd surely have to register with FinCen. Given a brick and mortar store, there are several tricks you could play to try and bypass the law. You could enact some sort of sell-buyback scheme in which people would purchase a product from you, and then can sell it back for BTC, effectively exchanging currencies. Whether or not such a strategy would actually work is dubious, however. Another way of providing easy Bitcoins would be to offer Bitcoin loans, and while this strategy would be surely legal, you would still have to ask to see government ID, and, depending on your state and the interest rates you plan to charge, may require another different license.

In theory, your proposed plan of borrowing an inflationary currency to purchase a deflationary currency sounds fool-proof; however, the two main problems with your plan are (1) short-term fluctuation risks, and (2) uber high interest rates. 
Basically, if the 5k MUST be repaid after 6 months, with no guaranteed refinancing option then I'd recommend against it, simply because there is a possibility that you may be forced to sell your Bitcoins at a bad time.
The interest rate, however, seems pretty reasonable, so assuming you aren't forced to repay the loan in full after 6 months, you should be fine. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:39:53
Ok, just to quantify this theory:
Just look at the number of blocks yesterday. 
The last block on 10/4 day was 261745.
The last block on 10/5 was 261964. 
So in that 24 hour period 219, which, according to a 10-minute-per-block schedule, should have been 144 blocks. Thats more than 50% faster than expected. If that pattern continued (which would be very unlikely but for the sake of argument say it did) then the halving would come about a year before schedule. In other words (as luck would have it) almost exactly a year from today.
