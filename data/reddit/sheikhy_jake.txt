Hasn't appeared to have done much in the very short term. Undoubtedly good for the longer term survival (and therefore value) of crypto.

If you're in this to make money from the noise on a daily basis, I'd say you are mad. A fools game.
Crypto has a good chance of being the future of finance. Hold on and quit checking the price every day.

The outlook of approved regulatory status looks more and more promising.  
"fundamental to the long-term future of bitcoin and the virtual currency industry" according to founder Yuzo Kano.

Yeah, I did. Stupid of me. It's a big exchange basically. "World's largest", in fact.

Past behaviour has been shown time and time again to be a bad indicator of future behaviour. Gotta look at the fundamentals.

Its probably the classic "not your keys, not your coins" which is a completely valid criticism. You're just moving trust from one third party to another (and frankly, I trust my bank more than Coinbase). The fees aren't small either. It is however, very very convenient and despite what I have heard from others, everything is basically instant.
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:11:44
The fees apparently...

I wasn't familiar with Hyperledger and have just had a quick skin of the Wikipedia page. It's certainly not trustless...

I suspect because he wants the ad revenue his blogspam generates. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:50:35
That's because it isn't widely accepted by traders. I'm still confident the average highstreet store will accept it in not that long and I wouldn't be that surprised if some country somewhere starts accepting tax in both fiat and BTC in my lifetime. It's lack of use as a currency is due to lack of adoption. I think it will come. I won't pretend to know when. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:42:01
I don't think it's totally without merit. When dealing with complex supply chains and the movement goods and money between loads of entities, having an immutable ledger of transactions that everyone involved can agree on is probably a useful tool.  Granted, I didn't see any info regarding consensus and the degree of 'democratization' in the system.  
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:35:28
Yep. It'll be a decentralised immutable ledger of fake news. The best sort.

A good idea. As an intermittent freelancer, I'd be keen to give it a go. How are you intending to monetize it? The running costs will be moderate if it takes off (and taking off will take a marketing budget). 
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:20:11
I completely understand your point. I agree than dollar cost averaging is not the optimal strategy if the expectation value is positive. You go all in with what you have to invest with. You're right, it isn't a substitute for diversification.
But no, if your intent is to sell short term (because you need the money it in liquid cash), I would suggest that going all in on Bitcoin is a dumb strategy. If you can't afford to ride out the dip, that's when you start losing.
Edit - I guess all I'm saying is the short term movement on something as volatile as BTC isn't far off of a RNG. In which case, do what you want - it's all relying on luck.
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:50:14
Time in the market &gt; timing the market. If you think bitcoin has long-term potential, the same applies here. Just get in as soon as you can.
If you're seriously trying to time the market, good luck. I'd go to the roulette table instead.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:19:22
I see your point. I'm inclined to agree.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:56:56
This is true if your investment strategy is long term. I get the feeling OP is more of the 'buy today, sell tomorrow' kinda guy. In which case, its's the same rules as roulette.
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:24:30
On the down low. Quietly.
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:42:31
We want to know whether exchanges are selling you BTC that they don't themselves have the keys to (ie. are insolvent). If we all cash out, can they pay up? That's the question.
You presumably aren't worried about the existence of your own keys unless I've totally misunderstood your situation.

I agree from a financial point of view. I agree with what you are saying. However, ultimately, geographical location will always have to considered from a practical perspective when considering non-financial issues like infrastructure and law/justice. I'm struggling to understand a blockchain based democracy that will determine laws and societal spending where you are able to fork to opt out of system A and into system B.
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:38:27
I think that sums this up nicely tbh.

Im not saying taxing real estate is difficult or prone to evasion. I'm saying that, alone, it is not a fair measure of someones wealth. Two people with wildly different salaries living in similarly valued properties should clearly not be taxed to the same degree. 
I'd argue that income is a better, but not perfect, metric.
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:39:23
We aren't saying it isn't a problem, we are saying that domain names aren't a source of authority in and of themselves and people need to understand that. If I was lucky enough to buy dollar.com that wouldn't make my website any more or less credible as a source of info regarding the dollar. 
Edit. It definitely sucks that BCH snagged the domain for their shitty fork. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:24:30
Errr... yeah... but then you are weighting tax based on real-estate ownership alone which is clearly not the best metric to use.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:31:14
Makes sense. Forfeit anonymity.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:41:11
I think there are a large portion of people who still believe in the welfare state. You pay taxes to pay for communal services like roads. This will be true whether bitcoin takes off or not and I hope we tax according to wealth to pay for things. I 100% agree with cutting out financial middlemen and allowing the transfer of currency without relying on an intermediate institution. I 100% hope we are still taxed according to wealth. Using cryptocurrencies shouldn't allow you to become a freeloader.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:29:44


I would argue that it didn't work very well. Evasion was an issue and still is for all cash-in-hand jobs. Sure, the system 'worked', but it is undeniably unfair.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:40:44
Ok. This takes blockchain technology far deeper than currency alone. Its an interesting thought.
 I can see a number of immediate issues:
* You need a central authority to verify that each person has only one address capable of voting
* You can fork a new government, but you live where you live. Purely a geographical fact. I can't imagine a set of laws for person A and a second set for person B based on which fork they ascribe to.
