Well in the futures markets - take CME Ags for example only 2% off all futures positions (both long &amp; short) are actually delivered.
The balance are just closed out, i.e taking the opposite side of your original position

All futures have contract limits for spec traders, to avoid cornering the market which was common thing to do in the early part of last century.
So not really controlled
Interesting story on cornering a market

Exactly !! 
Sure it's a laugh (the first time!) but quickly gets to a groan with the entire circle jerk (which is happening to most subreddits as more people join). Espically when seeing the same memes over the past 12 months !!
It clogs up the feed,  finds it that more difficult to find good information and conversations.

Yep - who did hear the old stories of the rookie trader who didn't close out his long position and ended up owning 100 head of cattle in the middle of Kansas somewhere ....
But just a tall tail (pardon the pun) ��

Having a quant trading background - I'm just thinking what my current models would think of this surge in prices - epically the last 12 months.
SELL, SELL, SELL
Edit: Don't have long term vol strategy in place over the last couple of years (for obvious reasons! ) but that would have made some money!
