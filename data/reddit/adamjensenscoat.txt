“Lending pools” then form to spread out the risk amongst smart contracts. The pools begin to lend beyond their BTC reserves because, loans are working out and hey, this is lower interest than those nasty banks.. voila fractional BTC banking is born.

Crypto is now mainstream and has been taken over by people driven by pure greed - this sub included. This won’t change. Everybody I’ve spoken with over the past year cares not about the tech or philosophy- they only care about getting rich.

Sorry, didn't mean to be pedantic. I presumed you to be American.
In a nutshell — Americans are very uncomfortable with, and ashamed of poverty. Whereas, in your part of the world (from my American POV), it appears that poverty is viewed through an entirely different POV.
IMO Americans wouldn't know how to process the mixing of classes that occurs in India. We hear lots about the divide between rich and poor in your part of the world but I think what people don't grasp is that the *physical day-to-day barriers between rich and poor* are not the same.

It's a good analogy, in that, in 1992 just getting an email address was hard to grasp for the average person. But we're in the digital age now, and whole product categories develop from infancy to mass adoption in short time spans.
Since BTC came to this earth, we've seen the rise of the mobile phone. And we've seen a whole ecosystem of products solve big problems... witness how fast Snapchat developed.
So it blows my mind that Bitcoin hasn't been tackled with the same level of finesse.
Everybody I talk to in this neighborhood (tech dude central) is interested in running an exchange, starting a fund, etc. Very few people are interested in doing the problem solving around the consumer experience.

It blows my mind that nobody has knocked it out of the park with a killer service &amp; wallet combo that makes BTC easy as AOL made internet for Grams. I must be missing something with incentives — part of the issue with BTC now is that a killer service couldn't skim off .01% of each transaction with today's tech. Maybe it's a chicken/egg thing, but I work in the creative/ux/design world and the lack of killer non-exchange-based gateways for BTC baffle me.

I guess that's an element of the past few months that gets me — People behaving as though there millions upon millions of new people who are yet to throw in and get in on this crypto thing.
My buddy kept saying this last month... "Crypto market cap will triple in 2018." But why? Why are we presuming that there's throngs of people dying to throw their money at this, if only they knew how? What's most likely... people who were crypto-curious have already made their play and have already thrown in what cash they have available into crypto. All of the hodl and buy evangelizing isn't going to make a difference when all of the stupid money has already maxed out their credit cards.

Very good point. The best players exercise control of their bankroll- and most importantly- can play thier best without resorting to ‘nothing to lose’ tactics.
 Story I heard from a friend who lived in Las Vegas is that lots of the household names of poker that we knew in the mid-2000s started to go on a bad run when online poker rooms like fulltilt got busted and the sponsorship money dried up for these players. Lots of big names who used to frequent  Las Vegas poker rooms started to go on bad runs because suddenly the money that they were losing at the tables was there actual real life bank roll. Before that time the big names would play recklessly at the tables and use the knowledge that a big paycheck was coming every month to gain a huge psychological edge on their opponents.  Among those people are guys who were household names just 10 years ago and were considered undisputedly some of the best players in the game. So yeah a lot of this comes down to managing bank role in managing bad runs. It will be interesting to look back in another 10 years to see how the Phil Ivys of the world are doing.
I think the take away from this is that some of our early poker stars were just guys who were OK at the game and got lucky going on a huge run and cashing huge add a major tournament. Some of those guys were able to land a sponsorship or two and used creative play and the weak meta game of the time to stay on top. Turns out without a steady paycheck to steak their action at the tables, they were mere mortals

I get you dawg. In crypto trading universe, BTC is the yardstick.
In the real world, its a thingie we either believe in or have bought to get rich. It's not ISO-38592 or anything codified on that level, but it's the thing that Billions in crypto are measured against, so for lots of us "it's our standard."
But yeah... if we're trying to call it a "monetary standard", that's pretty delusional.

I agree with that sentiment — except that a solution that involves tokenized USD can fill in that slot very neatly. I find very dubious the idea that, because there's a brewing financial revolution amongst the world's unbanked, Bitcoin or another present-day coin will be the direct benefactor of that.
What's more likely is that an established payment processor, bank or combination thereof will establish different de facto payment standards across the 3rd world, giving the unbanked access to *stable* currency as a hedge or alternative against unstable local currencies.
Nothing about the past year shows us that the crypto market, at heart, isn't for anything less than people like me, who use BTC as a tool, and people like me who use BTC as a store of speculative value.
Yes the potential market for fast crypto payments is literally everyone on earth — that doesn't change the investment narrative or mean that we should be dogmatic when it comes to BTC.

@_date: 2018-01-08 22:51:10
No. Nothing remotely like that.
We're talking about vast slums built around skyscrapers with million-dollar condos.
In general, America is like a tin of multi-flavor popcorn. You have your rich people (caramel corn), middle class (cheesy corn), lower class (popcorn) all separated into different sections, neatly split up.
India (or at least Mumai) is like Nachos Supreme. You have your tortilla chips all mixed up with your cheese, chili and jalapeños. It's all mixed up man!
What this says about the societies is very different. While the divide between rich and poor in India is astonishing — the *amount of interaction* — the rich have with the poor is very high. Both through proximity and through their day-to-day interactions, since almost everything in India (driving, opening a gate, operating an elevator, fetching milk) is done by poor laborers.
So from a certain POV, India is a very fucked up place, but there is a strange method to the madness, and a very different way of viewing wealth and status. From another POV the US looks at poverty as cancer — a thing that needs to be cured, treated or willfully ignored.

They're not on the same level at all. One Bitcoin = $11,317.
But yes, at the end of the day, the only thing that *truly* matters is that (1) a market exists with significant trade volume, and that (2) market has staying power.
Scaling up that market to thrive at levels above $40k/BTC is another story entirely, but what really matters is that BCH lost the shitcoin war.

You are basically saying *past performance = future results.* Everyone in crypto, myself included, look like investment geniuses after 2017. We don’t know what 2018 brings, we just have strong beliefs about it.
I could be saying the same about (insert 10x growth stock here) in other years. I’ve been in BTC since the early days and think the POV that contiued parabolic growth and eventual mass adoption is a longshot and grows more complicated as we march north of a $20k valuation.

A given nation or economic zone's GDP lends value to its currency. That's how.
This isn't a controversial topic outside of Reddit.
@_date: 2019-07-14 06:02:52
Someone smarter than me could explain this.
It doesn’t lead to a higher price, it’s a price suppressant. But beyond a certain threshold it can lead a coin into a death spiral - or at least, lead to extreme downward pressure... But when prices are rising, miners are incentivized to hoard.
Anyways, I’m talking out of my ass at this point. I’ll see myself out.
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:57:30
There is probably a rough calculation you could perform that correlates a given nations GDP with the amount in circulation, amount of foreign bonds held, etc. etc. I think if you could arrive at this math you'd find out there's huge dislocations in the market thanks to psychological factors, state actors, and expectations of future performance being 'priced in.'
Extra wrenches are how the currencies are individually denominated, and things like the Eurozone, where many nation's GDP are indexed into one blob of a currency.
But most importantly — We have the Forex, where the billionaires and degenerate gamblers of the world get together to establish currency valuations.
The only thing that *really* matters, in the long run, is what the markets think. And those markets make their decisions based on a whole slew of things, with GDP being perhaps the most basic metric.
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:25:40
It's valuable because it's secure, portable, *fungible*, limited in supply - and importantly - leveraged by the network effects of its popularity.
But for any mined crypto there is a hard value provided by POW that builds-in a floor for how we could value the currency as a payments network. It's not all bunk. There's a relationship between the overhead of BTC mining operations and downward pressure on BTC price, as coins are sold to cover mining costs.
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:29:26
In a large part yes, the prices we witness for BTC are an expression of the currencies that were exchanged for it at some point. Since BTC is a stateless currency, speculative money has entered at one end and not left on the other for us to arrive at its value. It gets more tricky when we think about the different 'on ramps' for money, and the fact that trade volume is pretty thin vs other commodities.
But yes, a good chunk of BTC's valuation has come about because Fiat currency has entered at some point - even if not directly.

Why should we read it like that? BTC, at the time, was very clearly overvalued with retail-stampede mentality driving the price up to $18k and the price eventually corrected to $3.5k, demonstrating that BTC *was grossly overvalued* by the market in that moment.
I’m a long-term BTC perma-bull, but the self-serving moon’y rhetoric that’s returned to this sub does nobody any favors.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:35:56
I appreciate the level of detail you've panted and respect the challenge. I think we have to figure out where in the chain TINSTAFL comes to collect in your story by finding equilibrium the easy way or the hard way.
We all know that we can't all cash out or the game of musical chairs stops — If BTC kept rising at this rate and we're at $500k this time next year, it would rear its head in some form that is felt locally. That could mean something as simple as, Lamboghi Huracans costing $2m instead of $200k.
Guess what I'm REALLY saying is that Bitcoin isn't creating value, it's creating some kind of pricing asymmetry because millions of us are trading it for cash. But what it *can* do it be a preserver of value, or at least act as an 'omnidiversified' store of wealth against all global currencies.
Automation is a bigger conversation — I think it's easy to paint the picture with truck drivers but really, automation is already upon us with factory jobs that used to be done by 10 middle-class workers now being done by 1 or 2. So far nothing good is coming from it - or at least, economic concentrations of wealth are happening and whole communities are being wrecked. Those people running artesian farms don't have a business case if the people around them don't have the income to support inefficiently grown/farmed milk/cheese/meat.
Other industries are automation resistant and will remain so for the foreseeable future. But... that's for another time methinks.
Anyways, the perspective is appreciated. I'd keep typing or thinking about what you said but I'm just ended my non-automated knowledge economy workday and am ready to punch a hole through the wall.

I don't buy it either — we're in the middle of experiencing a long, uncomfortable cooling-off where the American standard of living is steadily eroded and the purchasing power of the dollar and - importantly - the effectiveness of capital, is slowly diluted.
I don't think there will be a moment where things go tits-up and preppers have the last laugh. But we *are* crossing a threshold where the idea of what is the normal, expected American standard of living becomes adjusted downwards.
There's no fighting this tide. Each generation has to fight a more efficient and globally-connected world that attacks whatever value-add America's middle class once held, but we're also a nation with a huge GDP, so we're always going to maintain a certain baseline level of wealth. It's just going to be shaky, and inflation will likely march on at a steady pace.
IMO Bitcoin is a sensible hedge. Like a slurry of all the worlds' currencies put into one deflationary bucket. I'd like to believe it could last for 20 years but I think a $1M bitcoin would bring a huge amount of institutional instability along with it. Hope I'm wrong.

You’re ignoring how global capital works because you think moon dreams are around the corner. Full global adoption doesn’t skirt the fact that all crypto’s value is derived from its fungibility into fiat or other cryptos.

No, I’m saying markets are not a zero-sum game. Because BTC took off like a rocket does not mean ‘the dollar is down’ relative to it - it means BTC gained value. The stock market took off the past two years as well, it wasn’t because the dollar is falling in value.
Think of the dollar as a stablecoin with time-managed inflation built in. It’s like the money version of the storm in Fortnite. The fact that you *want* to exchange your cash for BTC or securities is a feature of the dollar, not a bug.

IMO you take that $1M and spread it out to hedge against risk. If I was a 'day one' BTC millionaire I would make sure I was
1. Living Debt Free
2. Owned property
3. Was properly hedged
If I'm worth $1M thanks to BTC it would be foolish to keep a majority of your net-worth tied-up in a mega-volatile currency. I don't need to become 2X or 10X richer at that point, I only need to protect my long-term interests.
That's not to say that BTC won't go full-moon, but wether or not that happens has nothing to do with one's personal situation. What's important is financial independence and if someone can achieve that by liquidating the majority of their crypto holdings we should be happy for them.

@_date: 2017-08-14 20:17:55
The range is massive. I live in San Francisco so $1M, in my POV, is not a ticket to the easy life. It's barely enough money to buy a condo. BUT an extra $1M (or even 500k) in the bank would be mentally liberating. I work in a high-pressure field and do well for myself, *today*. There is no guarantee that I'll be able to earn at or above my current level 5 or 10 years from now. This has created a situation where I'm constantly having to be on top of new trends, tools, etc. to stay a step ahead of the curve.
I would *love* nothing more than to have the burden of career stability cast aside so I could focus on working on the kind of projects that speak to me instead of doing what earns the most money.
That being said, if you're somebody who has experienced a 5,000% ROI windfall — in any asset class — it's irrational to wait for 'fuck you money' to happen. The sensible thing is to take your profits and let a portion of your holdings ride out.

Here's the thing... other blockchains have tried to capture the same network effects of bitcoIn, but haven't succeeded, or are just sorta stalled-out.
I'd liken bitcoin to Facebook... there's 100s other social networks attempting to gain momentum - only a handful accumulate a significant user base and even less are able to monetize.
So Bitcoin can be replicated by almost any smart group of engineers, but the massive network of hundreds of thousands of miners running billions worth of equipment, with an audience and name recognition can't be replaced. 
It can only die in a MySpace-like spiral if another coin gains wide adoption, and the likelihood of that happening in the near future is looking less and less likely.
Imo by the end of the year, the market cap for bitcoin will be large enough that it will have something resembling price stability and all other coins will look like junk bonds from an investor and retail pov.

It grows (or decreases) in value in exactly the same manner that precious metals do. The larger the demand, the higher the quote for the underlying asset. 
The hypergrowth we've been witnessing the past two weeks represents a doubling of the amount of €, £, $ and other currencies that have been exchanged for BTC — thus raising its price.
Important to know that the amount of BTC in existence is finite. So, like gold, it's supply is limited and theoretically will grow in value at a pace at least equal to inflation.

I think the bias against good ol 'profit taking' is hilarious on this sub.
Reminds me of when my buddy won $15k on a single spin of roulette then proceeded to bet even bigger because he 'wanted to take the whole casino down'.
Anybody who has been holding these past few years is more than entitled to take their windfall. The idea that BTC must go moon or else has become a fever dream on this sub. $4k is ALREADY A MOON FOR MANY OF US.
Personally I'm goong to cash out 20% of my holdings because I have a credit card to pay off and the opportunity cost of eating any more interest on the principal far outweighs a totally-not-guaranteed outcome of my BTC being worth a million dollars in 8 years.

This is a giant pile of misinformation.
The Fed’s charter allows it to run a modest surplus in good times. “Profits” go to the US Treasury. It is a central bank in all ways, set up to be immune from the influence of politicians (Trump’s posture towards the Fed demonstrates why this is good) with the benefits of decentralization via its 12 banking districts. The Fed’s goal is revenue-neutral.
All of this has been created to build a monetary system that doesn’t boom and bust, which was why the Fed was created in the first place.
The 2009 bailouts left the public rightly skeptical of the fed, but nothing about BTC fixes the fundamentals of our economy or monetary policy.
A world with a BTC reference currency is one that is inelastic, and unable to respond to big shifts in the economy. That’s why we went off the gold standard in the first place.
As for our dollar - it’s backed by the economic ouput of the US, and also to our relationship with OPEC and the oil markets. The dollar is very much ‘backed’, it’s just designed to be inflationary.
If you dislike inflation, don’t hodl dollars. Buy Stocks, Gold, Crypto, wheat futures - just don’t hang on to large amounts of dollars and you’re doing just fine.

Good questions. Happy to answer in order...
MySpace/Fb not the greatest analogy since history treats different kinds of first-movers in tech differently. Google wasn't the first search engine but Amazon is still thriving. Bitcoin has remained the leading cryptocurrency for 8 years and has survived some big hurdles, so its longevity seems all but certain for the near-term.
Why don't people adopt other coins? They have. Etherium, Litecoin, etc. They're all out there, many of them have credible backing and some smart people who have built them with an eye to the future. Many of them function better than Bitcoin with some trade-offs. The question is weather any of them will harness the same network effect of Bitcoin, especially now that Bitcoin has supernova'ed and is more likely than any other contender to go mainstream.
As for Bitcoin doing something differently than in the past? It does tons of things differently, but whether or not this is something that adds value or changes the investing landscape is something that finance and economics wonks could argue about for weeks on end.
I see it as an index of all currencies and services that have been exchanged for it. Maybe dollars go in one end and yen come out the other. Doesn't matter. Functionally, it's a fool-proof inflation hedge, provided enough people buy to hold.
I'm not convinced at this point that Bitcoin has to be accepted by major retailers to become a long-term success. It seems like it's strongest use cases are illicit or at least, for those who want to move large amounts of money fast and anonymously. I personally have used it to pay-in and cash-out of online Casinos — and it works brilliantly.
But calling it digital fiat IMO is going too far. It is something and nothing at the same time, it has the same mechanisms of exchange as the fiat we trade it for, with the very important exception that its issuance is on a fixed schedule, is deflationary and its value can only be diluted by a 'true' exit from the currency. So - lots of the same sorts of arguments that gold bugs might make in defense of metals and coinage.
Because Bitcoin lives in the world of unfettered libertarian capitalism, all of its value, or lack of value, is determined by the masses holding the currency. If everybody wakes up tomorrow and decides that it's time to cash out, we could see Bitcoin crash to the same level it started at — or everybody could feel that they want a piece of this imaginary pie and we could see Bitcoins valued above $10,000 by year's end. There's no telling.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:19:56
My price alert just got triggered. Wow!
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:06:03
 I appreciate the questions. I am not a bitcoin ideologue, so I don't mind.
Two things:
1. Herd mentality and high public awareness. Bitcoin is easy to purchase once you know the ropes and we just passed a couple critical deadlines that have determined bitcoins technical destiny for a while to come. The past month has been a 'test' for bitcoin's mining and trading community and bitcoin itself has come out looking rock solid. For these reasons, anybody not wanting to be left behind is throwing their money at bitcoin, causing a ludicrous rise in its value. So really, bitcoins value SHOULDNT rise in value this fast. This is either a red hot bubble or the result of large actors in the investment world acting on the green light that was Aug 1st's aftermath. We're in uncharted waters so we can only speculate.
2. The market capitalization of bitcoin is relatively low compared to other currencies and asset classes, so it's been 'easy' for a small amount of very big players to move the market.
Right now bitcoin's market cap is around $67B — gold's market cap is somewhere in the neighborhood of $7trillion. I don't think it's realistic to expect a $1trillon market cap for bitcoin but if its not crazy to think that $300b or so could eventually find its way...
Edit: keep in mind... bitcoins original vision was not that of an investment vehidle. It has become that because people are irrational and like to chase patterns. We could see bitcoin drop down to $200 per coin by next year.
For now, the bitcoin 'brand' is strong. This gives it an edge over other digital currencies. It remains to be seen if people will come to view bitcoin as an asset they hold onto in a rainy day fund or as an agile hedging tool that can't be seized by authorities. Its emergent properties are what sparked its value — belief in its future in the form of currency traded for bitcoin is what's propped it up.
One more note about market cap — there are 16.5m bitcoin in circulation. That number will eventually approach 21m. For reasons i cant explain because I'm not a mathematician - mining the final 21,000,000th bitcoin will be virtually impossible.

 It is neither undervalued or overvalued it is a payment remittance network with unbelievable computing power with decentralized consensus. What is that worth? Right now it's worth $4000... it was worth half of that one week ago. Could be worth 200X next year.
 This is the fun and amazing thing about bit coin. We have a completely free and decentralized market with no real capital controls aside from the volume that the network itself can withstand. What we are witnessing right now Is arise that we have seen before in bitcoin but never at this magnitude. Any of us pretending to know what next week will bring is nonsense. We're in uncharted waters.

@_date: 2017-08-13 07:02:42
This is a great question.
There are several properties unique to Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies, but for the sake of explanation I'll keep this discussion limited to Bitcoin only) that are unique and — like gold — give it utility beyond simply being a store of wealth.
1. Cheaper and more flexible remittance than any other platform. I can send $200 or $2,000,000 from my phone to anywhere on earth for a fraction of the cost of any other payments network. If we're comparing to Western Union there's no comparison. Also payments are confirmed through the network in a matter of minutes or at the most, an hour.
2. Decentralized. Comprared to PayPal, there's no middleman gatekeeping the flow of money to or from my wallet.
3. Secure. This is something that has been stress tested for the past 8 years. If you store your bitcoin properly, nobody can get at it. The security is a discussion beyond my paygrade and the core innovation that makes bitcoin's existsnce possible.
4. Anonymous. This is a huge deal. It's no secret that a good chunk of Bitcoin's value comes from it's use as an hard-to-trace black market currency. People who need to move large sums of capital around and have the technical creativity to launder cautiously love bitcoin. It's a great store of wealth and you have many options at your disposal to obfuscate the source and destination of transfers. 
5. Acceptance. While it's early in the retail game, and not legal tender in most places - there is a thriving world of bitcoin infrastructure that makes taking your bitcoin and turning it into dollars, yen or pounds possible. This last bit is huge — the fungibility is the final step that makes bitcoin a bona fide condender.
Put it all together - and what you're buying when you invest in bitcoin is a slice of an ultra-powerful payments network that also behaves like a currency. The currency itself has value because people have exchanged money and services for it AND because it is a finite resource (only 21m bitcoins will ever exist - also very hard to explain).
So depending on your pov, bitcoin will be valued for different reasons. If you're a crime lord, it has obvious applications. If you are a prepper who dislikes banks, same goes there. If you're an online casino, it's an amazing tool for payments. If you're just an average dude like me, you're buying as a hedge against dollar inflation, and voting to support a currency that is doing something that hasn't been done before.
At the end of the day, the underlying technology has lots of value, but today's meta-value is speculation. Today's skyrocketing interest could turn into a just as powerful bear market if people want to exchange their profits for local currency em masse. Imo there's still room for bitcoins market cap to grow by 10X in the coming years... it will be a wild ride.

I think the perception of Bitcoin as an investment vehicle is very subjective and depends upon an individual's situation, their outlook on technology, the future and their personal read on human nature. 
Bitcoin is a very clever mouse-trap with properties that make it something of a barometer for geopolitical instability. Just this past week Japanese trades accounted for almost 50% of the Bitcoin trading volume. It's sorta like Bitcoin, by it's very free and opaque nature is a magnet for unicorn and black swan events.
My personal suggestion is to open a brokerage account with Coinbase and purchase a trivial amount of Bitcoin (or whatever you don't care to lose) and enjoy the fun. I would not view it any differently than purchasing Euro or Franc on the Forex.
I don't think you can attach 'value' to BTC as there's nothing to realistically measure a distributed, anonymous remittance network of this kind against. If you spoke to me in 2013 I would have been preaching the 'value' to you, but today - the cat is out of the bag and I only suggest folks dive in with money they're willing to lose.

The volatility is *precisely* because we have margin calls. Price discovery is a game of whales playing leverage games against smaller fish who are also using leverage in their positions.
What does a systemwide crash mean? Like, a large correction in the equities market? We'll probably going to have a definitive test of that within the next 18 months. So far it seems like Gold is behaving like Gold and BTC was *maybe* a leading indicator.
IMO the push to crypto as a safe-haven has already been priced-in at the current level (I'm long so hopefully wrong here).

Guess we'll see. I've just been DCA'ing tiny amounts for the past several years. Bought in back in 2009, and have kept an eye on the space since it was just a fun idea to mine on my cruddy MacbookPro.
I think BTC, at this point, is mostly a heard psychology experiment. But also super interesting in that everybody sees what they want to see in it.
You see a 'young' 10 year old asset. I see a very mature 10-year old proof-of-concept that, for all intents and purposes, has already mooned twice.
Since the birth of BTC we've seen the rise of Uber, Lift, Snapchat, Air BnB, Venmo, Square, Instagram.
They've all become multi-$B operations. And so has Bitcoin — The cruising altitude of BTC has been discovered and now we're in the long game where lots of dudes are trading, buying, holding based on sentiment, libertarian feelings towards monetary policy and really nothing else.
Anyways, I'm intrigued to see where this next ~2 years takes us since it's basically 'finals week' for BTC since we've all been talking up a SoV narrative since day one. Either BTC becomes an important piece of driftwood to hang onto if/when equites markets tank, or the markets will decide that it's just another equity. Time will tell.

Agreed that the federal minimum wage should be indexed against inflation. If you live in a major metro then you've enjoyed some big min wage hikes in recent years - but IMO - min wage increases shouldn't be politicized.
Policy-makers tend to love making minimum wages something that goes on the ballot/to vote because then it's something they can 'give you' vs something that should just be dispassionately adjusted vs inflation.

That's not how money works. And that's not an accurate history of the gold-backed dollar. Nixon de-pegged the dollar from gold in 1971.
If we had an economy that was purely settled in gold ad other physical monetary instruments our growth would be lagging behind developed economies with elastic money supplies. There's a reason why no developed economy on earth has a money supply pegged to hard commodities.

This meme explains 2014 perfectly. But today, digital payments are near-ubiquitous in the US, and completely ubiquitous in SE Asia. The area that could/should have been occupied by BTC is now occupied by Venmo, ApplePay, etc.
And really, BTC's volatility almost guarantees that it will never be used in manner we dream of. Not that it *can't* happen, but the moment of the sea change came, and the adoption didn't happen. IMO we're going to be in the SOV, portfolio hedge-phase of BTC for a long while unless the market cap explodes to a level where it has similar volume to Gold.

Exactly. It’s no different than ‘American Express accepted here.’ It’s another transaction layer a retailer can use if they think it will benefit them.
So far, demand to use BTC in this way is pretty marginal. I live in SF and should see BTC ACCEPTED HERE in every other shop window — but there’s almost none of that. 
Venmo and Square Cash have occupied the space that was previously reserved for BTC. Our community took off in a speculative  direction and BTC development has been twiddling its thumbs, because the money is in the exchanges, not in creating a user-friendly remittance layer like Venmo.
The window for things to be priced in BTC left the station 2 years ago. We all treat it like a commodity now, and so it shall be. We won’t see things being priced BTC for the same reason we don’t see anything priced in gold or silver.

From investopedia:
Warren Buffett has often said he avoids investing in the technology sector because he does not like to own stocks in companies whose business he does not understand. Even during the dotcom boom, Buffett shied away from buying stock in hot internet companies. While some have characterized Buffett’s avoidance of the technology sector as his inability to understand technology, there may be a solid reason from a value investing perspective.
The Economic Moat
During the dot-com boom, Buffett identified two specific reasons why he generally avoids investing in the tech sector. The first reason is technology companies have limited the economic moat as a competitive advantage. The moat concept is a principle of Buffett’s style of value investing; it refers to the competitive advantage a company has in its business that allows it to generate long-term profits and continue growing market share versus competitors. The moat serves as a buffer of protection for continued profitability.
Hard to Pick a Winner
The second reason is Buffett believes it is difficult to pick winners in the technology sector early on and build a position at a reasonable price. Even a general survey of companies from the dotcom boom shows how some that seem to be unstoppable are capable of falling apart. Thus, there appears to be some truth in what Buffett is saying.
Still, Buffett has not completely avoided technology companies. As of May 2018, Berkshire Hathaway owned 165.3 million shares in Apple, valued around $42.5 billion. This investment seemingly replaces the company's 2011 investment in the tech sector when it bought 64 million shares of IBM stock, which were subsequently sold in 2017 and 2018.

@_date: 2017-11-22 18:59:41
No, you didn't get it.
The reason competition doesn't move in is because — *to facilitate the creation of high speed networks* — regional governments will grant guarantees to telecoms so that the risk profile of investing billions of dollars in laying down cable is reduced to a minimum.
Without these guarantees, no investor in their right mind would take on the risk of creating a high-speed network. They'd be better off parking their money into other projects, with a guaranteed rate of return.
The alternative is — Just have the public create the high speed networks and cut out the telecoms altogether. 
Do we want that? Do you want your State Government floating a $10B bond so that they can subcontract to 500 different entities that will charge outrageous day rates and eventually turn what was once estimated to be a $20B project into a $60B project?
*So getting back to the point*... Your government and private interests have done a complicated dance to create the high speed you're using right now. Applying a simple Adam Smith lens to the problem isn't useful, because — as with building a lighthouse, a bridge or an electrical network — neither the free market nor the public officials are capable of delivering what benefits consumers.

Ding ding ding. We *treat* BTC the same way others treat gold. Hodl and all that. Everybody in the community is looking at each other saying ‘c’mon guys, spend this currency.’ And very few are. It’s the conundrum of a deflationary currency. Why spend it, when hodl will make me wealthy in the long run?
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:26:15
 Oh I don’t think they find a way to screw it up. I just think that human nature is predictable and competitive. Bitcoin solves a very specific kind of problem and I am a big advocate because of the privacy security and speed it offers over archaic institutions like Western Union and the swift settlement system.
But ultimately bitcoin becomes the subject of investor game theory just like any other equity, and here we are. I think it’s so funny to see this sub on one end wanting to subvert the grip of governments and banking systems over our money - but at the same time, daydream about a future where those same governments and banks *adopt* bitcoin, and use it, as though their use of BTC over other currencies would completely transform the nature of those institutions and unleash financial freedom for anybody who had the foresight to hodl.
@_date: 2019-02-04 05:34:45
It works for cross-boarder remittance when there are convenient off ramps into fiat. The exchanges are the lifeblood of bitcoins market price.
Bitcoin will survive no matter what, but if you remove the exchanges and the public's ability to convert their Fiat into Bitcoin it's value will be marginalized to niche use cases.
BTW Hodling Bitcoin doesn't add liquidity. The trade value of BTC does. If you remove the exchanges the trade volume vanishes and price discovery becomes the wild west.

This is a 1-dimensional outlook of what currency is for. For the most part, people don’t hoard cash and keep it in the bank hoping for interest to keep pace with inflation. They invest that cash in equities (including BTC), bonds and real estate, seeking the best return on their money.
There’s no magic to it. The inflation is designed to keep the economy moving - so that your productive output ($) then seeks out the most productive way to put itself to use. If everyone hodls dollars, the economy grinds to a halt. Nobody wants that, and that’s why no developed nation has adoped a deflationary monetary policy.
I’ve been on the bitcoin train for 10 years and it has astonished me to watch this sub basically decent into peepper’ish wishful thinking and profit-driven fever dreams.
BTC remains a brilliant technology, and I don’t need it to grow in value or provide me with a financial windfall for it to be a worthwhile technology for those who need permissionless cash - for whatever reason.

ISPs already offer tiered product for different audiences. Your typical broadband retailer will give you three options with different levels of service.
The problem is, there is a massive sunk cost built into offering ANY modern online access. Just like building Amazon required investors to suffer through a annual burn rate in the billions of dollars to finally see a return on investment.
You can see net neutrality as insurance against an ISP deciding that they need to whitelist certain types of content for it to perform as expected.
Direct case in point - if a buddy has a NFL stream you want to watch and it’s not via youtube, but through a VLC client.
By focusing on the politics of infrastructure itself you’re missing the strategic play that may eventually lead to an intetnet that just gives the advantage to Google, Facebook and Netflix - while all the good stuff you like to enjoy risks getting much slower.
Of course this is one of many possible outcomes.

For most deficit spending nations this would be disastrous. The entire mechanism of an inflationary currency is that you are able to frontload the value of a loan, create economic activity, and then inflate away some of the expense of the initial loan. If your currency is deflationary, this works in reverse and stifles public investment.

I think the article you linked is ridiculous — It wants to place BTC in the center of world economics by the virtue of it's properties. BTC doesn't have *anything* to do with QE or debt. Nothing.
Nothing in the macro trends involving implosion of an overvalued stock market, or a manipulated Chinese economy means BTC = moon. Gold bugs have been saying the same thing for my entire life. Good is a good hedge against inflation and a stable store of value, over time.
There's no reason why a gold standard or BTC standard factors into all of this. This is just wishful thinking for anybody holding large amounts of either. Before BTC hodl, there was Gold hodl and everybody in the 80s was screaming bloody murder about our national debt.
And 'complete default' isn't a thing. This is a ludicrously reductionist view of world debt and how the global economy works. None of those 4 scenarios are likely to occur — This is just prepper talk, that presumes the world is doomed. I can't help that. Preppers have been preaching financial endtimes sine before we were born, and now they get to choose between Gold and BTC as their messiah.

It was a real factor. The unwritten history but observed by many of the golf war was that Hussein was preparing to denominate his oil exports in euro instead of dollars. This might seem minor but was a very real threat to the balance of power that exist in the region and the supremacy of the USD in oil settlements. But it’s also worth pointing out the complicated relationship between the different players in that region, and really we were standing up for our interest in Saudi Arabia and maintaining the integrity of OPEC.

I can tell you firsthand - the game theory you sketch out doesn’t work in the real world. External factors skew the playing field.
I live in the heart of San Francisco. I have two options in my neighborhood- Comcast and AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T uses antiquated DSL lines that are cheap but servicable, Comcast is the only high speed provider.
Everybody in the building hates Comcast for the usual litany of reasons. We are begging Sonic, Google, anybody, to lay infrastructure into this neighborhood. No go. The process for laying new wire in this area is blocked by acres of red tape, both real and manufactured by politics and byzantine rules about property managers requiring certain conditions to be met for an external provider to have access to a building for installation.
Long story short. When it comes to infrastructure, you can’t just overlay a Pepsi vs Coke POV and expect that the market will function to the benefit of consumers. There are billions of dollars at stake and the actors - both private and public - are not stupid and have everything to gain by skewing policy to work to their advantage.
And before you say it — yes there’s nothing but inefficiency built into SFs administration. What I’m saying is that you’ll make people hostage to a single broadband providers’ demands in many markets because of regulatory capture and/or (in my case) physical barriers to infrastructure prevent another player from moving in.

If you consider that there's about 180 currencies throughout the world issued by sovereign nation-states (or economic zones) and *none* of them are backed by anything then, yes, fiat has outcompeted backed-currencies.

It might be, but the only metric used is ‘market cap’ because you can’t know how much liquid cash has entered any given market. It’s universally understood in the trading world that market cap doesn’t equal money invested.

Name a single country that’s on the gold standard.
There are none. Switzerland gave it up over two decades ago. Fiat currency outcompeted gold-backed currencies into extinction.

Market cap calculates a hypothetical total market value based on the very last trade price. That's all. It doesn't mean the underlying asset is actually worth that — it just indicates *current trading price X the number of units in circulation*.
Because BTC is traded at relatively low volume, all it takes is one mega-whale to commit a $100M buy or sell order to have the BTC market cap move several billion in either direction.

Precisely. There's no reason why a Venmo-like platform couldn't exist using BTC as it's medium. Sadly, the volatility is too drastic for this, even if a AAA engineering team was on the case.
Much as people love to see their balance increase over time, a user base broad as Venmo's would not tolerate a week like this, seeing their balance lose 30% of its value in a couple weeks.

Venmo was just a twinkle in the mobile payment’s eye just a few years ago. Now it’s almost ubiquitous amongst the under-35 crowd. It has occupied the digital habits that BTC and crypto wallets should have dominated by this point.
BTC has been with us for 10 years. How much tech has come and gone in those intervening 10 years? Then idea that crypto is in its infancy ignores all evidence to the contrary.

Not sure if it would be anything more complicated than a wallet with a social layer on top and some kind of bank processing aspect so you could cashout at-will.
Guess if we put all the pieces together it's far more complicated than it sounds. If anybody can make this happen, it's Coinbase.
Wish they were focusing their product more towards P2P payments, than being an ETrade for Crypto. IMO, it would be great for adoption if they made it so you could pay your friends in the crypto of your choice plus the easy entry/exit they provide. It wouldn't be the same as owning your own coins, since their platform isn't a wallet — but would be great for adoption.
Not like you own your dollars on Venmo either.

I'm sure their PMMs have been wrestling with this idea for a long time and leadership feels like they rather be the Etrade of Crypto rather than the FB of money. That's fine when you have a bull market and are making a killing on fees.
I think, if/once BTC flatlines and enters an ice age of sorts that Coinbase may be willing to pursue this strategy. Sadly, I think it may be too late, but it's probably the best bet for mass adoption — I could also see this powering a merchant payments platform of sorts.
Again, the hard part is convincing the public — why do they want this if they have Venmo for petty cash to begin with? Unless there's an aggressive rewards system that can compete with the Sapphire cards of the world it may be hard to get people to see the value.
Personally — I've been a crypto maximalist for 10 years, and still would prefer to use my CC for day-to-day transactions. Rewards points stack up.

Basically this. If the US and EU decided to ban the fiat on/off ramps of crypto, the jig is up. Price would immediately tank and the cost of mining bitcoin in the wastern world would be completely unfeasable. Hell, it would probably be unfeasable in nations with cheap electricity too.
I feel like this basic concept is lost on this sub half the time. The sheer fungibility and portability of BTC is what gives it value.

It doesn't *need* a government decree for value — BUT — It requires a measure of government approval/compliance for it to be fungible. In a certain way, cryptos are Fiat-backed Slushies.

@_date: 2017-09-27 19:01:06
One very possible version of where we're going is BTC being worth $30,000 per coin because 80% of BTC holdings are from institutional investors.
We'll have our moon coin, and it will be owned by the same people running the show today.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:59:18
I think a lot of us a bit. Dreamers would love to think about moon but really from the perspective of anybody who was holding since the dark days of $200 we already have hit that moon. And now we enter a phase where all of the smart money is very aware of bitcoin. So the next phase is where does the retail investment dollars come from? It could be that we enter a period where bitcoin is a genuine asset class people throw their retirement into...
Or big coin could attract as much trouble as possible thanks to a high valuation.  From my point of view it seems like it has grown too fast to remain even slightly stable. When you have a giant pool worth about $100 billion that nobody technically owns all kinds of crazy shit is going to happen and I don’t really see an end to the kind of fork shenanigans or  wrestling matches over the epicenter of crypto.
 So when people start saying stuff like “if only 1% of the worlds liquid assets went into bitcoin we would have moon“ it drives me nuts. 
Tl:dr - great point.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:58:48
Unless, of course, we can multiply the amount of hodl'ers by a factor of 10 — That's the plan.
IMO BTC isn't yet in a place where mass adoption or lower volatility is realistic. Strangely, we probably can't reach BTC stability until we're around $15k-BTC or so.

Every time we've had a surge in value it has been correlated with a market opening up to legitimized BTC exchange. BTC can thrive as a 'shadow' currency, but it won't ever approach moon-levels if retail and institutional investors can't easily convert their capital gains through legal means.

@_date: 2017-09-27 18:31:42
Mostly for illicit means, and a way to move large amounts of capital cost effectively without involving an intermediatry — and I'm not saying that as a slight against Bitcoin.
Use case: Personally, I gamble with offshore sportsbooks on a regular basis. Usually don't cash out more than $1k at a time.
In the past, I either had to do a bank wire - which was slow and could take up to a month - or had to do a cashier's check. Last time I did a cashier's check it was stolen from my mailbox and caused me a big headache.
With Bitcoin, I'm able to get a payout in less than 4 hours and - by moving the money around - am able to get that money safely to my bank account within 24hrs.
*Now the important thing* is the last leg of Bitcoin's journey — onto my bank account. The fact that infrastructure exists to easily convert Bitcoin into $/€/¥ with the ease causes Bitcoin to have real intrinsic value. Something that would be difficult to execute via normal methods becomes almost frictionless with Bitcoin.
The volatility you are witnessing has to do with the newness of bitcoin coupled with a small market cap that is very sensitive to market sentiment. It could stabilize some day, provided Bitcoin survives to be the crypto currency of choice over the long term. But - we probably shouldn't expect stability until we're well past $10,000k per bitcoin.

Hey thanks for the perspective. I enjoyed this analysis. I've been a long observer of BTC and crypto markets since the early days but have never quite saw things through the 'Nokia' lens.
It's interesting how HODL culture has turned a not-small swath of the BTC retail public into marks for traders. Personally, I'm keenly interested to see where BTC 'shakes out' since I've been along for the ride for a long time and witnessed the ups and downs.
It's really interesting to see the 'trading is bad' mentality permeate this sub, in that it just puts the retail investor in a position that's easy to exploit. Personally, I trade the highs. Not like I'm great at it, but it beats getting burned.

It’s just interesting to watch this sub turn into a strange sort of anti-banking doomsday prepper wealth cult. It’s like the millennial version of the pro-gold pamphlets I’d read in the 80s warning about how international bankers were on the brink of tanking the American economy.

I think BTC retains most of its utility in an all-out prohibition scenario. But during a theoretical transition into prohibition, hodlers would get soaked. I realize nobody on team Moonshot likes to believe this, but the rise in BTC price was connected to market access. Regular schmoes and traders like my parents could just open their phones and purchase BTC.
So yeah, you can't ban BTC or crypto. But you sure as hell can tank its purchasing power.
But really, the SEC and ESMA haven't made any serious rumblings about draconian controls over cryptos — so all of this noise is more a matter of this sub having persecution complex tendencies since - "BTC will break the big banks" is a more compelling story than "BTC is embraced by big banks" (despite the fact that we love to share those big banking headlines as a signal that a bull market is around the corner).

There’s levels to this. There’s a huge secondary market of people with new S-Class money who are interested in a barely-used Phantom or Brooklands. Just like there’s people with new Rolex money who are interested in a gently used Vacheron.
Personally, I bought an expensive luxury car for 25% of MSRP because it had 4k miles on it. Could I afford it new? Sure. But I’m a stickler for money management and refuse to pay sticker because that’s financially irresponsible. This applies to almost every facet of life - being selectively frugal adds up.

People who would want [this car] ( because they can swing it and they want to experience something exclusive.

Beyond the overhead of securing the chain, and the value and convenience that provides, the BTC is very psychological - albeit heavily influenced by a small group of actors that can steer the market like a thermostat. Of course this applies to many equities, so it's not like BTC is alone here.

In order of asked:
- People are buying. Many for speculation, and many for practical reasons.
- You can put money down on a house with BTC if you liquidate.
- There are exchanges, some of them very well established at this point, where it's easy to go from BTC-to-USD and back.
- The crash scenario is what happened in the earlier days of Bitcoin with MtGox. Exchange fraud is still very possible today but the market cap is large enough that it wouldn't impact BTC's market value in the the way it did several years ago.

Seems like — FWIW, it would be more cost effective if there's a breakthrough in extracting hard-to-reach gold deposits on earth than going out in space.
On the other hand in 200 years or so we'll probably have robotics good enough to do the astroid mining for us.
Pretty neat to think of. So many things we assign value to are just valuable because they function as a claim on goods or services.

Because it’s already been priced-in. The market has been eyeing this for well over a year. There isn’t a trader alive that isn’t aware of the halving. All market participants are looking at this and hatching plans accordingly.
The fact that everyone here is sitting around expecting a meteoric rise in price when we just experienced a 3x pump tells you everything you need to know.

It's working as well as it can. Not sure how you think a direct-stimulus would be more effective. George Bush Pt.2 did this — It stimulated low-end consumption and nothing more. It was a boon to retail and, by-extension, net exporters like China.

And lots of bots are monitoring movements to get in/out of leveraged positions. When you see these sharp spikes it’s because there’s a relatively small amount of traders all using leverage.

It scales with the amount of currency that it has been exchanged for - that's how we arrive at its value. 'Society' isn't creating a value for BTC, global market arbitrage is.

I see it the same way. OP isn't accounting for the reaons those markets are sized the way they are. The macro-utility for BTC is hedging - thinking it could grow to even 1/10th the size of gold seems grossly optimistic. I'm bullish on BTC but I think we find ourselves at 5k this time next year if interest stays at an elevated level.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:36:44
Yes. It's easy for a small number of whales to move the BTC market today.

@_date: 2017-07-22 21:45:23
I think it would. Maybe the only drawback being that if you were stockpiling gold like a good prepper, you'd have to keep it somewhere safe.
The global gold market is an order of magnitude larger than the BTC market, so not nearly as volatile. If someday the BTC (or alt) market tops $500B we'd see something resembling price stability.
IMO we could see a tripling of BTC's 'market cap' sometime in the near future, but all of this moon talk seems disconnected from the nature of BTC itself.

USD has had steady 2% inflation for most of this past decade. This means, if you are a saver, you need to put your money to work at a 2% or greater annual rate of return to maintain its purchasing power. Without this incentive an economy grows stagnant and inefficient.
This isn’t a controversial mechanic of our monetary policy outside of our BTC or Gold Bug circles. There are hundreds of investment vehicles at your disposal to hedge against an inflating USD. BTC is one of them. So is a gold ETF or any number of index funds.

I don't know where people get this idea from. There are massive swaths of our modern financial system that are undergirded by contracts backed by *real commodities.* Oil, precious metals, crops. Fiat is one abstraction of the output and wealth of a nation-state or economically unified zone.

Which at this moment is 2,859USD, 2,538EU and 313,000¥. The fungibility and broad adoption of BTC is what gives it value. I'd love to draw charts and graphs but I don't think it would change anybody's mind.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:14:35
I'm long on BTC but I don't understand why people think that BTC is a Fiat-killer. BTC, as it exists today, is explicitly a fiat-backed currency. It has value, because it's fungible. The most recent explosion in BTC value happened because it became more fungible. BTC is, in essence, a currency of currencies.

For the reasons you mentioned, I like to transact in cash when practical. I hate the thought of merchant fees skimming what little profit small retailers make from a sale.
Folks should be banking with credit unions. I don't see crypto as a catalyst for any of this change but I like the idea that miners are seeing profits instead of a giant payment processing network.

And when there is nothing to loan and no loans are given out our economy grinds to a halt. Debt and the spending and investing dynamics that come along with debt are integral to the first world.

Couldn't agree more. I own a small piece of a currency with unique and desirable properties, undergirded by wide adoption and supported by a relatively modern infrastructure. The valuation of my satoshis has a 1-to-1 relationship with the value the network provides and the perception of the value it may provide in the future.

I think you’re thinking of the Cypriot financial crisis wherein many Russian, etc. families had to spirit away millions of euro without running afoul of the authorities. I recall a spike in BTC at the same time that seemed a bit too coincidental.
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:10:40
Absolutely. I feel like the antiestablishment subset of BTC bugs have been barking up the wrong tree. What BTC threatens to disrupt isn't fiat currencies — it's entrenched payment networks like Visa, MasterCard and remittance networks like Western Union.
If I have $5,000 to send overseas there's no better medium than Bitcoin to get the job done. If BTC remittances become preferred by the masses (very plausible) it opens up a whole can of worms for the players who have made their nut skimming transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-06-26 05:35:32
There is a range of outcomes for how BTC and others will change the financial landscape. All of them involve major banks hedging into cryptocurrencies and cryptoservices.

It's not possible. We have already experienced what full-out investor mania is like with BTC and crypto. It created a moon of $20k. That's the ceiling of what the network effect was able to achieve. You won't be able to replicate this until the next investor cycle, possibly 5-10 years down the road.
"A watched pot never boils" and BTC is now that pot. Any spikes beyond support levels will be crushed by profit taking in the near term.

What other loan companies are you referring to? Your loans are invariably underwritten by a bank or by a huge, publicly-funded institution somewhere down the chain.
But let's take the 'end of fractional banking' to its conclusion — We would just live in a world where it's very, very hard or expensive to get a loan because the risk exposure is too high.
Yes we can all become the bank with BTC or Crypto, then people will pool their money together to minimize exposure to risk, then bigger players come in with better rates, then bam a bank is born that is offering you either smaller loans or loans with higher collateral demands.
Or other way around, people create bigger, more efficient go-fund-me type loan portals. They skim their percentage to cover operating costs and make a buck.
