Yes, the dogecoin crowd is generally excited about the possibility of dogecoin becoming very valuable and making them rich, but this is far from the driving factor. It's kind of like being a kid and hoping that your Pokemon cards are worth something one day, but mostly just loving to collect and battle the motherfuckers. A lot of people enjoy the goofiness of it or, like myself, think of it as cryptocurrency on training wheels. I was interested in, but couldn't wrap my mind around, bitcoin for a while. Thanks to all the helpful people over at I've learned a ton and will probably trade some of the doges I've mined for BTC at some point. The tipping is fun too. You can tip someone 500 doges, which is worth like 60cents, but sounds like a lot and it means way more than an upvote. I think this is what a lot of people hope it stays as, a fun cryptocurrency that is useful for microtransactions such as tipping or charity fundraising. 
Obviously, there are people in it just to try and get rich quick, but that's not the vibe most people give off, nor seems to be the mood of the community. You can really tell when the price of doge nosedives, and nobody cares, everyone is just as jazzed about "going to the moon" and being "rich shibes", and making stupid doge memes as ever.

Just like any good Ponzi scheme.....

Yeah, but tipping or receiving 0.00014BTC is super lame. In fact, it's only about 0.00014% as fun as receiving 100doges which is worth the same amount in USD.

Dude, you do not get dogecoin.
