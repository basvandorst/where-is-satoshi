Fuck off. He's raised almost $3mil in August alone and is pulling double digits nationwide. Eat a turd you fucking cuck.

I as well. Between Bitcoin and House of Cards, my wife is sleeping alone tonight. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:47:36
Hopefully so. Then the other exchanges and purchasing platforms can begin whatever recovery is necessary. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:39:00
This is what I hate. Already had to explain to several people who watch me post on social networks about Bitcoin that the "biggest exchange" having "fundamental flaws" doesn't mean anything about the Bitcoin protocol. I'm preparing statements for tomorrow as I type.

Except subpoena's to twitter take 72hrs tops. Speaking from unfortunate experience.

Does anyone know when it will be available in all states? (Missouri, specifically) 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:47:47
I'd like to save it to send it to some buddies but I can't find a way that saves it with audio. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:56:23
West County Center?
@_date: 2013-10-22 02:26:09
Couldn't that service go down, then you'd equally be screwed? Not being sarcastic, this is a genuine concern.

I've noticed this.. why hasn't he been banned from this sub? 
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:12:07
Same. Expected instant and found out the card is required *in addition* to the verification I already did. I don't have a problem with the policy, though a kindly email notifying me would've gone a long way. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:28:48
There's no fee for the service itself. The cloaked email service comes with one (I think) and more can be purchased? I don't use that feature so I'm just recalling what I've seen. BTC is done through coinbase so I imagine whatever their fee is? Haven't noticed much of one but I'm just betting small amounts. (Probably no fees anyways.)

Just sitting there masturbating?

Couldn't add text in the link, and I wanted to clarify; I'm not saying they ARE just looking for discussion on whether the feds consider BTC a money-laundering tool, and whether or not they will do something about that in the future.

Authy (at least for some devices, I think) released a Bluetooth proximity login, I believe. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:46:17
That's how I feel. I'm enjoying the $100 because it's easy to remember and think of how much it's worth, and I think there's a nice steady influx of people using it and businesses accepting it too. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:07:39
[Actually only twice. The second time was after I posted it.](
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:40:45
As a follow up question (unfortunately without having looked at the site) is it possible for others to pay bills? Or remotely pay bills? I could see this very useful for people who travel overseas etc. Just pay rent when it's due through BTC. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:08:37
Considering no one is able to withdraw from Gox, I wouldn't say that price is very "real" in my opinion. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 20:41:43
None of those are the Verge article. Same news, different bent. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 14:16:09
It's actually pretty easy to verify for instant buying. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 15:19:43
Never fear, [they allow this]( too. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 02:44:57
Sidebar on this topic, it doesn't help that most price apps for mobile pull Gox's prices. Easier to look at that widget than open coinbase, for example.

I think it would be awesome to do an introductory style video, almost like the "we use Bitcoin" one, and then just have it sponsored by someone like Coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:00:01
Haha. I was catching up on @_date: 2013-11-09 01:39:52
OP you're from St. Louis? I am too. Bitcoin meet up? PM if interested.

The reference was made this morning by someone commenting after this news broke. Nothing on his public profile about it. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 14:30:25
Seems legit. 
*before the flurry of downvotes, note that this is sarcasm*

If you're worried that's still the case, at the very least I would enable two factor authentication on your account if I were you.

Is it just me or did this happen last Sunday? Maybe my memory fails me but I swear I saw a "Bitcoin down to XX" last Saturday/Sunday.
