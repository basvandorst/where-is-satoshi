What about the first venture funding just after R&amp;D. I don't recall any startup venture funding prior to the rise to the peak.

I almost feel like Bitcoin is old money already, what with all the new uses for blockchain technology and the 300 odd other more enhanced currencies available.

Jersey already acts like Bitcoin, a logical step i presume? Although its taken this so called bastion of finance, Jersey a long time to jump on the hype of bitcoin, now that its being superseded by much more interesting uses of the protocol.

know when to pump and when to dump buddy. Alts arent all competitors with bitcoin, look at NXT for example.

It's sitting at the top mate
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:06:07
well i ve had some spare change sitting there a while now, and no issues, i will go check agian now. Also you realise there is a lot of drama right now with all the exchanges preventing transactions becouse of the DDOS attack. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 10:01:51
I can get behind this idea. !
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:00:49
you may well have been played
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:24:16
I am heading there this week to investigate. I will let you know if you remind me. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:13:11
yes a lot of the exchanges are down currently till they find a work, but i just checked my btce and all is still sitting there. i think you may want to consider finding your receipt of transaction and contacting them .
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:50:44
i was expecting exactly the opposite from this sub, unless your being sarcastic? 
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:26:44
r for rumbled!!
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:47:11
I think your right! Makes me think "how did I get in to bitcoin?" To be honest , I can't quite recall anyone promoting it to me at all. Hmm. Must think.
