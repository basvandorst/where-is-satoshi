If you have a lightning wallet, BlueWallet is good for a quick fix, shoot me a 420 sat invoice on the reddit DM and I got u. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 19:36:19
Also, the two ppl that see this comment. Send me a 1-2 thousand satoshi invoice on the lightning network and I will fulfill. U can tell

I believe you can withdraw, similar to an exchange. I’m guessing you pay the fee to close the channel plus a bit extra. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:25:24
Of course, it all depends on how the design engineer wants it to function. You can creat whatever wallet you want on top of the network. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:18:27
Nope, you can see in the video. When you get enough it’ll start using ‘Bitcoin’ and decimals.

I had no expectations, and I’m still disappointed.
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:38:14
You ruined it...
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:17:13
Except you can’t sell anymore in the US
@_date: 2019-05-21 18:14:42
Ya, but can you actually sell. I can guarantee you can not. You can buy all day with an ID
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:18:17
That’s awesome, I’m very glad you were able to find selling BTM’s,
As I was not able to and had to resort to online services.
I think regulation is still sort of under the radar right now and if you know you don’t say, cause you have bags. I tried about 5 companies over 8 BTM’s and they were disappointing to say the least 
I’d still rather have BTC tho, because you will probably find more buyers than even gold.
