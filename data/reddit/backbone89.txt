You guys do realize that by participating in bit coin and crypto currency you are funding the most evil acts that humans have ever been capable of conceiving? Sans genocide.

You can’t use money online anonymously, and when you use it in real life it’s most likely not anonymously because you have to interact with real people to make the exchange.  Crypto’s entire purpose is for the exchange of goods with complete anonymity online, which allows for dark web activities to thrive.

Yeah I hear ya.  I just don’t see it possible that people are using money online anonymously.   Am I wrong?  Like, there is always a digital trail, one that is exponentially more easy to for the people trying to stop the terrible things to see.

There are things that happen on the dark web that would make your skin crawl.  Never mind the fact that drug dealers buy pounds of whatever they want, including cocaine, using bitcoin.   There are things called “red rooms” which I don’t care to elaborate using text, there is also human trafficking, pedophilia and any number of more things.  Most all of this is funded by crypto currency.  I don’t advise watching videos about what actually goes on in the dark web, but there are videos explaining these things if you are interested in learning.

I could be wrong, but I believe the difference is that crypto currency makes it nearly impossible to trace who is actually spending the money.  And the fact that cryptos value is based off the amount of users participating in it has something to do with it I imagine.  But again, I could be wrong
