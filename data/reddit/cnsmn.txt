Lol, who talks about Bitcoin Cash? Are you that blind because of your argument last year? Haha, Bitcoin cash xD Same shit ;) Im talking about Millions of txs and Lots of GB to transfer through network.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:33:50
Ppl try to build something like that around it, but BTC is still slow and outdated. Whatever you build around it, will not fix that.
ADA was a fresh start, from the most experienced ppl in the space and with scientific peer rewiew and audited ico.
If you like to compare it, feel free to do so, but to me its just a different approach. You dont even srcatched the surface with the little excerpt of what Cardano is up to. But I know its in early stage and I really dont wanna offend you BTC guys :) 
But to me its brilliant and woth to check out.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:48:46
No, nobody gave me ADA. They audited their ICO and are very transparent about funding. But Treasurys are much better for funding a company sustainable.
Not comparable to those scams like BTG xD
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:44:57
I dont think so, but maybe youre right. But it is in fact more usable than BTC already.
We avoid using BTC since months and it has been a good decision so far. 
We start building something in Berlin usimg ARK and ADA, both DPoS Systems and decent backbone Infrastructure to build up on. We want to create decentralized Companys, something BTC is the worst Option to choose :)
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:47:43
I see miners taking control over the whole thing. Driving fees to an obscene level and wasting energy for a whole country. I just dont think that is a good solution. with and without LN. Thats all. I dont wanna say dont use it. But there a a couple of better options to choose imo AND no real reason to stick with BTC.
I dont understand why its taken so personally over here :) didnt expect that.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:10:34
I meant BTC with thing. I dont like the BTC protocol, so i dont really care about LN at all.
Edit: There were so many rational reasons to not try to make something outta the very sick patient BTC, than just use something thats not broken.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:34:03
No Prob :) good idea! haha, I was mad as I realised what I stumbled across, haha
Here is a good interview, where Charles explains the Problems with BTC and ETH and why they build a new platfom.
Peace and have a good one!
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:09:05
Okay guys, I dont wanted to frighten anyone haha
Im gonna leave now! Just started discussing since I saw this post and thought one might talk about real tech issues and not throwing Buzzwords.
Have fun! 
Don't buy Cardano!!
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:19:55
If you like to find out the "Lightning Network" is just a crutch, stick to Bitcoin.
Otherwise you should check out Cardano for example :D
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:01:58
Thats unfortunately not true. BTC isnt the most decentralized and secure Blockchain.
It was a very very good approach and a nice proof of concept, but certainly not a global currency.
Have you heared what Cardano is bulding right now?
It provides already the same security than BTC does. And its aware of a lot of other problems. If I should pick one, Cardano would be it. 
Please think about BTC again. Yes its hyped, but no, it is very old tech. LN is just a try to fix the issues, but they will still be present.
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:56:31
Why not using a Currency that is able to handle just payments without any channel shit?
No need to add a second point of centralization to BTC, since we already got the miners.
Sorry but your solving the wrong problems in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:32:43
Its the original resolution on that exchange!
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:07:07
Feel free to stick to your Shitcoin ;) Guess there were still ppl using netscape.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:53:04
Believers gonna believe ;) Yes, a bit less centralized, but still controlled by a few. Have fun with it. Will stay on 0 BTC atm.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:45:39
Yes. Adoption, adoption and adoption. BUT, I never ever use BTC or its forks. Just crappy old shit, ppl please inform yourself about recent Technology. Adopting useless code is not a good idea. Use something, that is made to serve the whole world, whatever project you believe in, but BTC will not be a global currency. The earlier you understand that, the healthier you Portfolio might be in future ;)
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:46:32
Its better in so many ways :D First and foremost its high assurance code, written in functional programming, that means, its haskell codebase is much more like math, than many normal programming languages, so its possible to proof, that the code is secure, with a very high level mesaured in assurence grade. It is used for Rocketscience or banking systems, whereever you really need to be sure there are no bugs. Think of all the locked Ether last year, cause of bugs.
The founder of Cardano is Cofounder of Ethereum and in the space from the very beginning. He has alredy worked on Bitcoin sidechains, claiming that everyone who tried that, came across alot of problems, cause BTC is just not able to support those sidechains as a platform. Thats why he decided to give it a new shot. I guess he knows why, and he explains it in a lot of interviews.
If you watch some of the whiteboard talks on the youtubechannel of IOHK, the company behind Cardano, you might really understand what I mean.
Ive learned a lot! And I see the whole industry with different eyes, after understanding deeper whats going on inside a Blockchains peer to peer network.
And I've not the time, but I could go on and on and on.
I would say Cardano is by far the most advanced Blockchain out there. Youll find out soon or later!
Have a good day! ;)
Edit: Not to forget, that Cardano is in development since 2015, so its not as fresh as it seems. They just launched their system in Sep. 2017.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:58:57
You dont seem to differentiate between completely different things xD. To me you compare apples to oranges. Yes, both are Blockchains with a second layer in development, thats what they have in common. Thats already it. They were running on 100% different code. BTC with PoW, ADA with PoS and soon DPoS, by the way my favorite^^
And the philosophy behind it is very different too.
@_date: 2019-07-24 23:05:06
There will be no final mined block until we go extinct or no single person on earth wants to keep BTC alive.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:05:56
I see your point, but Linux would not be where it is, if Linus would not have been there for his project until today. Projects need vision and someone, who is in charge. Look at the stupid Blocksize debate. Thats not how progress works.
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:02:51
@_date: 2019-08-10 20:47:30
Just give a full example to understand, if you want us to follow your question properly! :)
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:34:49
Wow, that sucks! I'm also very unhappy with the single project I did Kyc on. Might never do it again, but I still think they were trustworthy. But yeah, you should not do it ever to be save from identity theft.
@_date: 2019-08-03 08:14:03
Not my opinion. I think other, better managed projects will succeed. Like Cardano, where ppl are trying to implement liquid democracy concepts. But we will see :)
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:15:42
and should not :)
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:22:56
If I had XRP, i would not be worried about it, whereever they are.
If you want them to be safe from a Coinbase Failure, you should have them on your own wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-03 04:03:24
This is shit! As said in the article its arbitrary. They just came up with an idea to tell who is guilty, its not about "real" dirty coins, its about people who say that a coin should be considered as dirty.
I dont like anything about what those researchers are doing. Its no better than flipping a coin in my view. In a world where this is implemented you cannot accept any payment before doing intensive backgroundchecks about the coin you are going to receive. Rendering BTC as payment method useless.
You are not realising the difference between peoples opinions and technical reality...
@_date: 2019-06-17 07:45:42
exactly xD
@_date: 2019-02-09 07:04:07
I see constant development and improvement in features and very happy with it. Coins I have are only 25% more devalueted than BTC. I can live with that.
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:19:01
Short answer is no.
@_date: 2019-02-09 04:25:47
Would be funny if all the BTC maximalists end up to be the real bag holders. I would recommend not to put all eggs in the same basket. The "shitcoins" are still cheap! ;)
@_date: 2019-02-11 10:49:24
No, no KYC, but you have to place a collateral, but I dont know how much. Its open source and works with multisig transactions. Its meant to be anonymous.
All info here:
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:43:31
All existing versions.
You can get a new one by the way, the earlier models still had warranty. I had luck sending some in and even got a pair of Donald Trump socks on top.
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:30:02
It will just be one Bitcoin in the end! Its just like Netscape, true and only browser there is.
Chrome and Firefox are just noise created from hype, deal with it!  ;)
Bullshit aside, no coin has any decent use so far, so BTC and all others are speculative atm, but if you understand the tech, you can make a better guess, than just beliving the mainstream Hodl stuff.
I got some chains in my view, that are from developer perspective very promissing. BTC is really not made to be interoperable. Thats in part why its so secure, but you can hardly build anything on top of it. Like the incredible slow development of LN shows at its best.
Edit: spelling stuff^^
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:30:43
They cashed out. Additional info here:

I know it will sound painful, but for other users in your Situation, I would seriously recommend to not hold that much in one adress. I never put more that 1-2k into one pool (adress).
Its safer, more private and you will loose just a bit.
Feel very sorry for you, Bro. :( Hope there is some good turnout.

You can look at lists of combinations like this, but even without numbers there are over 1300 combinations.
So yeah, you should have a brute force software and make complete lists with all possible combinations.
Edit: Some software suggestions:
@_date: 2019-02-11 08:32:19
Try Bisq.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:17:03

only in hindsight :D
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:33:57
100% stupid advise! Obviously you know shit about crypto! Your just a believer.
Sorry for being so rougth, but I hate reading this bullshit all over the place.
@_date: 2018-12-01 23:53:11
Oh, sure! Totally forgot about it, thx!
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:46:13
I dont come from an Investment perspective, I'm interested in the code and technology behind things.
I can only quote Edward Snowden here, who shares a general perspective about that matter here:
I know I can leave whenever I want, but if people give stupid advise to newcomers a broad range of opinions is a good thing.
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:45:17
Have you heared of BISQ? Its a decentralized BTC exchange working with Sepa and Peer to peer. Like LocalBTC decentralized. They are not flooded with Liquidity, but I always saw some good offers.
If you can do wiretransfer its the safest way in my view.
Good luck!
