Last year in January during 15 days currencies went down more than now. 6 month later the currencies was valued 10X more. I would not worry to much. You will be happy in 6 month if you hold now. This is one correction. The bitcoin price went up to much in to short time.

Yeah, this would honestly be the biggest thing in history when it comes to mainstream adoption. People have been hearing about crypto from SO LONG, BUT if literally everyone and their mom suddenly has crypto (whatever coin it might be) right there in front of them, adoption would skyrocket. This would be absolutely insane.
