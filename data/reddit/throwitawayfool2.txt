Since I didn't see it in any of the other posts, it's really as simple as finding the wallet.dat file on your hard drive. It's in your "application data" folder, the location of which varies depending on which version of Windows you have. You can usually type "%appdata%" into the address bar of any open Windows Explorer box and it will take you there. 
Once you find the wallet.dat file, MAKE A COPY and keep it secret. As one other poster said, you could use PyWallet to export the private keys and import them into Blockchain.info but the easier way would be to install the latest version of the "official" Bitcoin software and let it handle everything. 
Hope this helps.

I sell cell phones.  I was helping this user, brand new to smartphones, set up his Gmail account so he could access the Play Store and set up apps.  I swear to god, he wanted me to put "hunter2" as the password.  I could not explain why that made me chuckle.

The "backup wallet" feature did not exist in the earlier versions of the Bitcoin software.

I've been buying my beer and wine from Target via Gyft for months now.  Just got back from a run 10 minutes ago in fact!  
...I think I left my ID on the counter by mistake though.  Gonna go back tomorrow and see if anyone turned it in.

Insane ROI didn't stop people from investing in the "Pirate PassThrough" ~~schemes~~ scams that promised something like 7% a week.

I once paid 4 BTC for a pair of N64 controllers in preparation for a big party I was hosting. At the time that was around $30 worth. No regrets.

My close friend texted me an hour ago saying "apparently the Bitcoin CEO committed suicide". I couldn't bring myself to explain how little sense that made.

I've been really interested in FreedomPop for ages because I like their model of getting 500 MB of free data a month. It's a cool concept, and I'd love to pay in Bitcoin. That's the thing that might tip me over the edge and make me a customer. 
That said, I'm really disappointed that this phone is a Galaxy S2. That's a WiMAX phone, not LTE, and Sprint (FreedomPop's carrier) is actively shutting down the WiMAX network in favor of LTE. If it was a Galaxy S3 I'd be interested.

Rather than a full Firefox extension, it would probably be easier to make a Greasemonkey script which uses Javascript.  Apparently it's very similar to Chrome scripting according to what I'm reading on Wikipedia.

This is going to sound pessimistic, but who are you trying to convince here?  Google knows more about you than you do at this point.  We should be scared that some singular entity has that sort of omniscience.
At the same time, I'll keep letting them abuse my privacy like that because Google's search and Gmail and Calendar and Docs and Voice etc are so bloody useful in my daily life.

I sell phones for 3 carriers and AT&amp;T is one of them.  When logged into the AT&amp;T system, it actually takes more effort to REMOVE the unlimited plan than to keep it, even when switching from iPhone to non-iPhone.  The system automatically removes the "unlimited data for iPhone" feature from your line and adds "unlimited data for other LTE phones" -- and I would have to manually intervene if I wanted to change it.
EDIT:  I should add that the "unlimited data for other LTE phones" option ONLY appears if the line already had unlimited to begin with.  Sorry folks, I'm not able to go around gifting people unlimited data.  Wish I could though...

I laughed my ass off, but I cannot for the life of me find the words to explain why I find it so hilarious.  I guess you kinda had to be there at the time to really get it.  ("only 90s kids will get this!" etc)
It certainly is the most effective means I've seen tonight of stating: "take a step back for a moment and realize how silly this current panic is"

Yeah I closed my account just now as well.  Not even out of spite or anything like that, just the fact that I've never ever used it for anything that wasn't Bitcoin-related.  I've seen a couple artists at anime conventions who would accept Dwolla but I see just about as many Dwolla logos in the wild as I do Bitcoin logos (that is, very very few).  
I wish them luck in their future endeavers.

Yeah I've had the official client installed since like the start of 2011 and mine got to be 18 GB before I finally replaced it with Multibit a month or two ago. 
I saved all my old wallets just in case one of those receiving addresses was ever used again but I highly doubt it.

I think mining should still be *mentioned* but it should be much less encouraging of the idea that "YOU alone with YOUR computer TODAY can make free money with a Bitcoin miner!" which, while still marginally possible in 2011, is not really feasible nowadays.  Focus on how mining strengthens the network by solving blocks, not the fact that new coins are given to the miner who solves the block.
EDIT:  by the way Jon, I still love what you guys have done.  I still use the WeUseCoins video to introduce Bitcoin to people who have never even heard the name before, although with the disclaimer of "Just kinda ignore the part in the middle about mining, it's outdated."

Woah, that makes total sense.  I thought it looked like I had duplicate copies of those files.
So you're telling me that all this time when Explorer was telling me I only had 3 GB left on my drive, I actually had 13?  Man.
Oh well, I'm still glad to be off Bitcoin-QT.  I miss the interface but I don't miss waiting for it to update for hours on end if I hadn't launched it in a week.  
Ironically, what's now taking up the space I gained from uninstalling Bitcoin-QT is currently being taken up by Breaking Bad episodes.  I'm way behind, lol.

Whether you get throttled after ~3 GB or not really depends on your location.  If you're in a somewhat remote area and your traffic isn't causing any congestion at the tower, they'll likely let you have your 9-11 GB per month with no complaints.  
In the more urban areas where tower congestion is more of an issue, there's increased pressure to force people off their unlimited plans, so that's where you're going to see severe speed throttling after the ~3 GB mark.
(either way, you're right in that you've got a killer deal for $30/mo there)

I had my iPhone 3GS for three years before switching to an S3, and I loved everything about it except the stock Samsung keyboard.  I could not adjust to the keyboard and how it merely *showed* me autocorrect suggestions without actually correcting it as I typed.  This was very close to being a dealbreaker for me, and I was about ready to give up and go back to the iPhone.
Then a friend suggested Swiftkey and that pretty much fixed that whole gripe.  Best $4 I've ever spent on my phone.  It replaced the keyboard system-wide (rather than having to open a dedicated app to use the alternate keyboard like you'd have to do on iOS), and it was very iPhone-like (but better!) in its behavior.  
Poor viewing in sunlight I will give you that.  Even though the S4 is much better than the S3 in that regard, the nature of the screen technology just makes it bad in direct sunlight.  
Even still, I'm happier overall for having switched to Android.  Plus I get to use the Blockchain.info app to manage my funds at all times, and the Bitcoin price-checking widgets I've got installed.
@_date: 2013-09-29 04:38:10
Sweet, thanks for typing all that up for me.  I'll be sure to do this. I think I saw an "import private keys" function on my blockchain.info wallet so I could use that.

Might want to update that status, as I just downloaded an update to my Android Gyft app yesterday and now I can buy Target gift cards with it.  I'm guessing the iOS app requires more lag time for Apple to review it though.
EDIT:  I have not actually tested the ability however, and looking at other comments, apparently Target cards aren't working very well at the moment.  I'll give it another few days before giving it a try with my own funds.

Check your recycle bin.  I think iTunes merely recycles the old version when syncing a newer one over.  You can then go to "My Music \ iTunes \ Mobile Applications" and put the old version back there.

Oh come off it.  Sure Linux may be inherently safer by design, but that doesn't make it immune.  Right now it's just security through obscurity.  If people made a mass exodus to Linux, don't you think the feds would shift their target as well?

I think you're talking about Swype actually.  That one comes built-in, and that's completely different.  Swiftkey is still a regular keyboard that you still tap once per letter, but its autocorrect is like that of the iPhone's.  As in, I can just mash the general direction of the letter I'm trying to type and keep going and the keyboard still knows exactly what I was trying to say and fixes it once I hit the Space bar.
Swiftkey costs $4 to buy, so I guarantee it didn't come preinstalled.  Check it out next time you're with a friend with an Android phone (just get the free trial version) and see if you like it any better.
