They say the best time to buy bitcoin was 5 years ago. The second best time is right now.

Also compounded by the extra nagging feeling that you could be getting MORE rich. You could have bought MORE bitcoin. Like, do you really NEED your TV? Your car? Your left kidney?

Sure. It’s more efficient to buy a larger amount in a dip but if your intent is long-term investment and if you’re confident BTC will keep rising (like most of us) it can’t hurt.

Coinbase is the most popular bitcoin app. Very easy to get into. Put a small amount you feel comfortable with and see what happens to it. 
Bitcoin is currently exploding in value. It has seriously tripled in value in the last few months. It’s possible that it could continue to gain value exponentially. Put in the price of a cup of coffee and see how long it takes to become two cups of coffee

Buy very small amounts of bitcoin. They will rapidly increase in value, making you less poor. Convert your reduced poorness into more bitcoin and repeat. Eventually your poorness levels will drop to zero

Gonna take a risk here and assume this isn’t sarcasm.... 
Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. 
You will usually need to verify your ID and a bank account in order to trade it
