What are you saying? The same thing happening to Bitcoin as in being a good store of value but terrible medium of exchange? Bitcoin is superior to gold in every way imaginable.

What's the point of this? Enlighten the world that gold is the most established store of value and bitcoin isn't widely accepted as a medium of exchange? Anything else that doesn't relate you want to throw into this mess of a video you made? Fucking dinosaurs. Just die already.

Bitcoin is about freedom.
If you're here because you want to sell for fiat when the price reaches a certain point: fuck off!

Thanks, I almost fell for this scam. I just converted all my BCH to BTC by sending it to my BTC wallet.

So you just lost 60.000 USD within 24 hours. Just go for a walk and enjoy the sunset. Well, fuck off!
