You've also just got straight amount of traffic during those times. Every F5 is a little more taxing

You think people are only into bitcoin for purely philosophical reasons? Oh sweet summer child.
I bought bitcoin to pay for VPN service in 2011. My change is now worth a few thousand dollars. I've used that change to trade for more. It's been fun. 
I find the "Only my Rights matter." Attitude and inevitably of ending on a sentence where "Pedophilia shouldn't be illegal" comes out of their mouth is what makes me hate Libertarians the most.

I like my alerts. They tell me to put in more $$$

Libertarians are vile creatures not worthy of attention. Should you encounter one, spit on it and make sure it's aware that society as a whole would rather it found a hole to die in. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:18:11
Nobody gives a shit what a libertarian thinks.

Sure, in the same way we both also use American dollars. It's the strongest of bonds we share.

Lol, you political trolls are sad. You gonna try using socialist as an insult next? The only insult is self identifying with a political ideology that can be shrunk to "I got mine. Fuck you."

An infinite number of possible altcoins does not equate "perpetuating the idea of monetary inflation".  No matter how it is cut, that conclusion does not follow with that statement.  
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:53:21
Constant reimagining of what the author was trying to say are cute. It involves a great deal of pretending.
There is no mystery here, the author "explained" it, and his statement and conclusion were simply stupid. That because there are an infinite number of alts, alts are inflationary, and if you use an alt you're promoting inflation. The author is a moron.
@_date: 2018-05-17 20:12:58
You are not actually supporting your argument that "support for X coin and not Bitcoin is perpetuating the idea of monetary inflation".
We have always had the ability to create an infinite number of representations for our currency.  Bitcoin isn't some special snowflake in this, it isn't the first deflationary currency, it isn't even the first digital currency.  It is simply another in a long history of currencies.  So argument that using a currency other than Bitcoin is pro-inflationary is purely a non-sequitur.  The conclusion does not follow from the statement. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:48:28
that... doesn't make any sense.  Nor does it follow from the first two sentences if that was what you were actually trying to say. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:01:47
I can agree with this.
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:10:18
Bitcoin has fuck all to do with Libertarians. That's the largest sack of shit I've read in a while. Unless by "Libertarian" you mean "Basement dwelling Libertarian whose only exposure to the full stupidity that is libertarianism is 'intellectual' debates in chatrooms".
You're literally trying to tie this to a group of political thought which outright preaches that if a child consents it should be ok to have sex with it. Fucking Christ...

The advantage there is the one where you've assumed a metric fuck ton about my other holdings. Go see the part where I have no interest nor requirement to share my entire portfolio with randoms on the internet to determine why they're crying chicken little about a bank.
You're right, I'm not making profit off the singular coin in a bank, purchased from said bank, to be available, should I have need, or want of it. I'm glad it upsets you so :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:14:57
Because I've not felt the need to explain every motivation to randoms on the internet.
I'm sorry you don't rank high enough to warrant my financial history and life story. I am thoroughly entertained by the guesses and straight up obnoxious replies and PMs though.
My use of one exchange, two exchanges, what's in my wallet, and what's just been pout into a waste bin are completely none of your fucking business. 
My favorite PM quote so far:


As if your tiny community held any power, lmao     
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:51:02
Thanks for sharing. I'd never considered that.  If only more twats like you responded the first year I asked a question from your community
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:20:20
 what's wrong is an inbox filled with some of the most obnoxious replies, and I have to say you and scruffy are quickly winning for largest sticks up your assess while simultaneously assuming a question about a coin in a bank represents the entirety of my portfolio. 
It's a bank. I'm not scared of a bank. The bank does not have the entirety of my holdings. It has a singular coin, so I can spend it easily, because that is what banks do. They siphon a mild profit from the account, and in return, I get financial services automatically handled that are annoying, or impossible, to do on my own. It is not FDIC insured, it has higher associative risk, it has lower risk than some of my stocks, it's 2k... 
I'm sorry the concept of a bank frightens you.  
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:51:51

@_date: 2017-08-02 05:51:43
Only because you're a twat

I have BTC in a plain ol wallet. I wanted to know why the Chicken little dance was happening for Coinbase. I'll wait until I see stable growth in BCC before I move any investment funds to it. For now I'll have ~3 BCC after the fork, not 4. I'm ok with that.
I bought 1BTC on coinbase so I can buy the very rare thing I need to buy with BTC. It is laziness in not wanting to go through hoops and hassle every time. But it's my money and I want it now!  
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:54:03

Meh. You guys are notoriously bad at speculation. Excuse me while I ignore the doomsday predictions. Besides I've gotten the answer I need: "Fuck all is actually happening."
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:55:21
But in a private wallet I gain nothing... Only exchanges stand to make or loss money in this
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:37:37
So if I've got BTC on coinbase, and haven't been paying attending to fuck all... what should I be doing?
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:22:13
Good thing I don't have friends.  Also welcome to literally every bank ever. What I'm picking up from you is that you're all twats and there is no reason to do anything for the Btc vs Bcc drama.
Got it. Going back to ignoring your community.  
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:26:56
Lol, I have BCC ya tard... Jesus you're dense
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:33:28
It is a bank. A financial exchange which accepts deposits and withdrawals of currency is exactly the definition of a bank. Its fucking PayPal for bitcoin... You know the faceless online bank.
Do you imagine a bank needs tellers, or to call itself First Bitcoin or some stupid shit?
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:32:28
I do have one, it's where the pittance I mined when I was mining sit. I bought 1BTC on coinbase to use for shopping and was checking that I wasn't missing anything terribly obvious. I'm not, it's just splitting, some were apparently keeping all their eggs in one basket and going all chicken little.
My investments are diversified, even the crypto. I'm a low risk, long wait, retirement investor. The little daily ups and downs smooth out at that scale. 
Edit: If there is a better service to handle my once a year, maybe, transactions, do share. But I'm not now, nor will I be, worried about losing 2k if coinbase shutters. Well... I'll momentarily be upset, but then I'll remember the money wasn't meant to really be making me money. It was to buy me random cool shit as it matured.     
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:53:26
You died doing the thing you loved. To bad it wasn't making money. You know nothing John Snow, shut the fuck up

Meh, bought 1, have been sitting on it, I don't much care where it sits, I just like it keeps going up in price.  I have zero fucks to give about any Btc vs Bcc vs miner drama. Just need to know if my btc will suddenly dissappear if I don't move services.
