I would agree with you but I recently had an injury that will keep me out of work for a few weeks. Thankfully I'm young so il recoup quickly.

Little late got in around 9.8k with my cost average 1 bitcoin is worth 10,224 usd. Well guess I just gotta hope it grows to 20k again long term. Possibly making weekly contributions.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:23:00

@_date: 2019-07-14 22:22:11
I just called coinbase they said kinda what you did. I have 1 confirmation on trezor but 0 on coinbase
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:57:44

@_date: 2019-06-02 17:05:51
How would people verify count 20 something 0's? Mistakes would be common
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:14:04

Do you know what cryptojacking is, and how to defeat it?
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:12:19
What exactly do you do in finance?
@_date: 2019-09-05 17:07:14
I'd say it is important, if you personally trade stocks or crypto does that mean you work In finance?
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:05:14
Is it only xrp you dislike? And that's why in my original post I talked about spreading out in the market. Realistically we both know the usd is strong.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:59:56
So you dont work in finance? Your sie test? Series 7? Nothing?
@_date: 2019-09-03 00:20:15
People could also just buy xrp. And hope. Or other altcoins. Or they could diversify. I'm BULLISH ON bitcoin! (Dont ban me)!
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:39:53
To transfer bitcoin from coinbase...do you HAVE to have a coinbase pro? And debating ledger or another cold storage
@_date: 2019-05-30 01:51:14
I am curious about this as well. Is there a way to move coins fro coinbase to and external hardware wallet. And then if not what exchanges are good? I'm a regular investor of stocks, no margin bs, I want limit buy/sells.
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:06:15
Could you elaborate? I currently use coinbase but I am a skeptic of It since it kinda leaves you high and dry, no limit orders. You cannot physically remove coins. And thus far their customer service sucks.
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:01:29
You're able to transfer from coinbase?
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:39:32
That round is down range lol. Its coming.
