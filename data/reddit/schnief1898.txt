Are you mining? If not, please do ;)

Yeah, maybe DVD is safer, but also harder to have secure in geographically independet places. I'm actually quite confident to remember all of my 50+ passwords I use, but I have them also written down in a very secure place.

Not sure I fully understand what you mean. You talking about a disk image of your Trezor?
I'm afraid I don't know much about hardware wallets, I create my own offline wallets with bitcoin-core client. See my edit above, when you change a password, be sure that all previous copies are indeed invalid. Since it's hard to be sure when you've given the files to cloud services, family members etc I'd use a completely new wallet.

What software did you use?
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:54:40
Upgrading before syncing should work. You just upgrade and point the client to the existing btc directory, it will verify everything and start where the old client left off.
You can send without syncing, but only if you create and send the transaction manually, I believe. This probably isn't something you'd want to do, but there are tutorials on the web.

I think you wrote down the password used to encrypt, not the private key, no?
If you used a strong password, not used anywhere else, to encrypt your wallet, it's pretty safe to store on cloud services. Brute-forcing a very long password with todays computers is pretty much impossible and not worth the hassle.
You don't have to store a full disk image, the wallet file is enough.
Edit: Personally, I use cloud, E-Mail, USB-Stick, NAS-Server and pretty much anything I can get to store my wallet.
Edit2: I think I used this guide to setup my wallet first time:

Password storage is more difficult, you have to make sure it's still accessible in case of a catastrophe. I'd say fireproof lock-box at least and maybe multiple copies stored by trusted family members. Be careful to store it digitally.

Your setup sounds like a security nightmare tbh...Someone might very well have stolen your coins!
I once recovered a lost password for my wallet by brute-force, but that requires you to know most of the password. In my case it was a single character error I made while entering the password. You could try that with your 3-4 passwords if you want.
- Bitcoin core does not have a default password and you are not prompted to set one.
- Check for capitalization errors/caps lock
- Make sure it's the same keyboard layout u used last time
- Search for unencrypted backup copies or try file recovery software
- Try adjacent keys on the keyboard
- In the future use linux live cd without internet connection to encrypt your wallet and reboot after
PS.: Here is the program I used:  (fixed small error)
You have to run ./bitcoind as daemon and setup a rpc password then compile with your password and run the program in the same directory.
It's pretty quick and dirty and you might get some errors, but it's working for me.
PPS.: I have written the program for linux, but apart from the system call to bitcoin-cli and the exitstatus stuff it works on windows too. Bottleneck is definetly the system() call, takes forever.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:43:41
If you need help setting up or compiling let me know. There are also other programs, check this forum for example:
Some people have posted their own scripts and programs there.
There is also 
Do everything without internet connection and with live cd, to minimize the risk.

I managed to recover (brute-force) a lost password once with a bash script within 2-3 hours. Only works if you know most of the password, though.
I don't have the script I used anymore so maybe try searching for 'bitcoin password recovery script' or something, there are plenty on the web.
Disconnect your PC from the net and try them. Don't trust any closed source software!
Good luck!
PS.: Maybe take a look at 
Use a Linux live CD without internet connection and give it a try. Reboot before connecting to the internet again.

Nice, happy to hear that!

We need exchanges as fiat/crypto gateways. Yes, they're centralized, but bitcoin itself is not. Everybody that is not a daytrader and holds some serious investment in crypto will tell you to withdraw your crypto from the exchange as soon as possible and store it in a cold wallet. The past has shown us, that storing your coins on an exchange for extended periods of time is not a good idea. Ofc those exchanges will take a fee, they're capitalist companies after all. If there was no money to be made, we probably wouldn't have exchanges at all.
I'd welcome more regulation for some of the exchanges, to make sure there is no shady business going on.

If you're german citizen now you don't have to pay capital gains tax (or any tax for that matter) if you hold for more than a year. I'm pretty sure selling bitcoin is considered as an "privates Veräußerungsgeschäft" here atm, if you don't hold at least a year it's considered speculative and you pay capital gains tax.
Be careful, when you didn't buy bitcoin, but mined it, this doesn't apply.
I'm not a tax consultant, so take everything with a grain of salt and do your own research. That's what I've read and it makes sense imo, since there are no special bitcoin regulations yet and it's not an acknowledged currency.
If you're not a german citizen the regulations of your country apply, maybe you have to deal with double taxation, but I don't think so, since neither you nor bitcoin are liable for taxation in germany. (Edit: Now that I think about it, since you work here you are. But if you're not a german citizen I think that doesn't apply to bitcoin.)

Well, change the password when the time comes... I wouldn't worry about it just yet. With more powerfull machines will come more powerfull security measures, I guess.
Edit: I think it's best to create a new wallet and send all funds there when you change the password. Just to make sure that all copies with 'weak' password are invalidated.

All they say is true for the current state of bitcoin, and is a rather well informed article about the subject I'd say.
I only disagree with this: "But it is unlikely that it will be speculators and aficionados, instead of supervisory institutions, who will decide on the path to be taken by the plethora of the cryptocurrencies." I think, apart from speculators, this is the primary reason bitcoin is attractive to many: Because it's rather independent from those 'supervisory institutions'. Nobody wants their stupid crypto-coins anyways...
Edit: I also agree that ICO's got out of control and are potentially dangerous. Too many scammers out there. "It is one more way to sell your idea to venture capitalists, without having to give up either share of your equity or control." I'd take share of equity and control anytime over some shady ICO garbage...

Good luck! Let us know if you manage to recover your coins or if you need any help.

Create a watch-only wallet, on blockchain.info for example. No need to sync everything!

1) This is a huge topic, but basically whoever has the private keys owns/has access to your coins. That's why most ppl with some serious investment use cold wallets (offline wallets) where only they have access to the private key. A cold wallet, if setup correctly, is basically unhackable. There is a lot about cold wallets on the net, give it a read. Exchanges get hacked constantly, it's not a good idea to leave your coins there for extended periods of time.
2) Depends on the reason you buy bitcoin. A lot of peeps, me included, hold bitcoin as a way to divest their money from the traditional banking system. Other people are just dreamers that hope btc will be worth a lot more in the future (might happen, who knows). The former will hold their bitcoin and are much less worried about volatility, the latter will probably sell off should the hype begin to fade.
3) Currently bitcoin is mostly not used as a currency, but for the reasons above. Some accept bitcoin, but usually with a payment processor that automatically converts to fiat for them.
4) It is weird, you should be cautious! I'm not saying don't buy now. If you have money to spare go for it, but be prepared to hold for a long time or to loose some. Personally, I would only invest with money I'm sure I can live without for at least a year or so.
PS.: Regarding 1) you have to be careful with cold wallets, too. A lot of people already lost coins because they messed up and forgot the passwords/lost their wallet. Do a lot of research and ask people if you're not sure before setting up a cold wallet. With cold wallets you are 100% responsible for your money. If you mess up, it's gone!

I guess, first post with no source. Sounds fishy.

Well, if you use a strong encryption you can do that, but then you still have to secure the key/password you used to encrypt your key/password :) I have not stored the password/recovery words digitally, but I have a kind of reminder stored encrypted with keypass  + my password written down in a secure place.

So, they're building an ETF on top of the futures? meh...

The european 'Fidor Bank' is pretty bitcoin friendly. They are directly connected to the german exchange bitcoin.de and allow their customers to do instant bitcoin transaction directly from their account.
I don't think they would close down accounts because of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:06:13
Obviously you shouldn't trust any single service provider. The easy to guess password is just an assumption. As I said I wouldn't save the pw digitally either.

Bitcoin cash is bitcoin with larger blocks. Problem is, that bigger blocks don't really solve any problems of bitcoin in the long run. Block propagation time, for example, only gets worse with bigger blocks. Bitcoin cash is a short term solution to scaling at best.
Edit: To be clear bch and btc are completely seperate. They are not compatible.

There is still hope!
If you're running a Windows machine and still able to boot, try the software 'shadowexplorer'.
You may still be able to get some files from a windows shadow copy, I have been able to restore all files from a encrypted filesystem in the past by using this method.
This only works if shadowcopy is enabled for the volume you have your data on, obviously.
Let me know if this worked for you!
PS.: Also, remove the cryptolocker first...
