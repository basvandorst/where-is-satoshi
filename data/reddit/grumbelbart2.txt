My thoughts exactly. Besides, I'm sure there is a way to simply use two or more transactions that are somehow connected to store n*40 bytes.

Intersting - It's always been like this in Germany. You can still exchange Deutsche Mark from 1948 to Euro.

There are plenty of other banks in the EU where OP can store his money with little hassle. Put it into a german savings account, and the money is saver than in local banks (insured by banks &amp; state up to some 100k euros).
My point would also be: Don't bet on one horse, don't put all eggs into one basked etc., unless you can afford to lose all.

Out of couriosity: this means that the number of possible transactions per time is limited?


This is correct, but keep in mind that (1) hand-held devices are still behind in terms of capacity, and (2) there is also a cost for sending the block chain over the wire, and by today, those costs can be very high (mobile, regions with slow internet).

I am with Deutsche Telekom, germanys largest internet provider. Their latest DSL routers block outbound smtp ports (25 and 465) except to some whitelisted domains (gmail, t-online, yahoo and some other big ones).
You can deactivate it in the router's settings, though.

I wish there was some alternative way to perform PoW by doing computations that are meaningful in some way. Is there any research in that direction?
