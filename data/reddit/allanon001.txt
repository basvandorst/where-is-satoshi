More like saying you like engines but don't like Ferrari.  Ferrari cars out perform most other cars and a lot of people would like to have one.  But Ferrari is not the only company using engines.

I don't think the comparison is accurate.  I can take my $50 that I just got from the ATM and go to Western Union and send it to someone for just an extra $5.  That someone will get $50 on the other end and go to their ATM or bank and deposit.
For bitcoin I need to first get bitcoins, let's use Coinbase.  I signup, give them my account number and phone number.  Then wait 4 business days to get the bitcoins that I bought, plus 1% conversion fee.  Send the bitcoins to someone for $0.01.  That someone needs to convert back to dollars so they signup to Coinbase.  They give their account number and phone number.  Then wait 2-4 business days to get the money in their account.  Plus a 1% conversion fee.
And lets not forget how the bitcoins that were bought and transferred might not have the same dollar value when it reaches the other persons bank account.  It could be less or it could be more.  You never know.
Moving money far better?

Probably still worth more than my car.

Still not a fair comparison because Western Union is used in emergencies like student needs help with rent, mom sends money.  Kid's car breaks down on road trip, parents send money to help.  It's also used to send money to families in other countries.  All these uses implies needing fiat.  Can't expect the person you send bitcoins to find someone willing to take bitcoin in an emergency.
Seems to me the only way this is a good comparison is if the person receiving bitcoins already has a use for them.

I get that bitcoin might become a standard and banks won't be needed someday.  But today you need to go out of your way to find ways of using bitcoin.  You can't go in to any store and use it.  The average person being sent money via Western Union isn't buying things online, they need fiat.
Thanks for the info about circle.com,  I will check it out.

Not in cases of emergencies where you don't have the luxury of searching for someone to take bitcoin.  Western Union is used a lot for sending money fast when someone is in need.  Also a lot of places and people like schools and landlords won't take bitcoin so it needs to be converted to fiat. 
Yes, bitcoin is great if you have a place to spend it but compared to fiat there really are not a lot of places that take bitcoin.

I didn't go in to banking costs because I'm sure there are costs with Coinbase sending money to and from my account.  And I'm aware of ATM fees.  I just left banking out of it.  And finding an ATM is easy and doesn't take 6-8 days.  Also what happens if your Internet is down?
I compared apples to apples, sending $50 using Western Union to sending $50 using bitcoin.  If you have an easier way to send $50 with bitcoin then please tell me.
As mariusuu pointed out the ad didn't compare $50 to $50, it compared $50 to any amount of bitcoin.  This isn't a fair comparison because most need the money converted to fiat unless they have someone willing to take bitcoin.

This sounds like an easy opportunity for scammers to create fake bcash wallets and steal private keys.  How can I find a legit bcash wallet?

But doesn't the US federal government see bitcoin as property not money?  I thought the IRS proclaimed bitcoin as property so how can a federal law consider a bitcoin transaction as a money transmission?

The mining difficulty changes depending on the hash power, less hash power less difficulty.  The block rate stays the same about 1 every 10 min.  So the transactions rate should stay the same no matter the amount of miners.

Try using [Paxful](

So down the road miners will need to rely on transaction fees to make money?  If so what prevents the major mining pools from collaborating and charging fixed high fees likes banks do today with credit cards?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:45:24
I'm not saying miners can't profit right now, I'm just refuting u/Morning-Chub's statement.

I don't think he cared about the fee,  the point was to get bitcoin at exactly 12:00 AM, Jan 1.

So I could use Bing rewards to get Amazon gift cards then use Purse.io to convert them to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:45:23
I signed up but didn't like the fact that you use your own Amazon account to purchase and ship an item to some anonymous person in order to get the Bitcoin.  I don't want to end up on a terrorist watch list for aiding a known terrorist.  Or be a middle man in a money laundering scheme.  I know that is probably not the case but I'm not risking being associated with unlawful activity.
If Purse.io would accept the Amazon gift card codes and add them to their own Amazon account and make a first come first serve queue of people's Amazon wishlist items.  Then Purse.io could have an indicator telling how much Amazon gift card money they have and what the cost of the next wishlist item is.  Once they get enough to purchase the wishlist item they take the Bitcoins from the person wanting the Amazon item and distributes them to all the people that put in gift cards for the item.  They then send the wishlist item to that person.  This would make them the middle man and responsible for all transactions.

They have District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in their list making 38 regions, not states.
