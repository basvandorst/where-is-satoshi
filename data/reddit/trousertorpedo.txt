This isn't a fallacy. 


This premise does not change for the entire argument. Neither do the two other premises.
You're also ignoring the fact Bitcoin hasn't been stable. Ever. Temporary stability doesn't count as stability - it's temporary. 
In actual fact, Bitcoin is deflationary, volatile, *and* people can (debatably) currently shift the whole market. Those three facts exist in tandem - the debate is whether or not they are a problem.

This is not even close to being true. There are [1.4 million tonnes]( of above-ground silver. That's a cap of $770 billion. Bitcoin's cap is $21 billion. Bitcoins' market cap is **2.7%** that of Silver.
You are confusing it with the market cap of all Silver ETFs ($20.7 billion), which isn't close to the market cap of Silver.

I'm using burned to mean "will never be used again." Functionally, all lost Bitcoins are burned. They effectively don't exist.

1 tonne of silver is not worth $20.

Credit cards exist because people wanted credit cards. Tracking is a tacked-on feature. It's not the motivation for the technology.

The assumption is that no Bitcoins have been lost (or burned). We don't need to know how many Bitcoins have been lost to know that is wrong. It is true that at least some Bitcoins have been lost, and it's almost certain that a significant chunk have been (given the early mining rates).

The estimated market cap doesn't factor in burned Bitcoins though. In reality, it's *way* lower than $21 billion.

This is conspiratorial, wishful thinking. People like convenience. If they can swipe a card and be done with it, 90% of people will be on board with or without a megalomaniacal world bank.

You should use the median, not a low estimate. You probably have much more than 375x to go.

*Everyone* likes convenience. That it's poltically expedient for the elites is irrelevant. Most of the world *is* pushing for a cashless economy. That's a correct statement.

That sounds like a terrible idea. If you want to have a sane debate, find this community which specifically selects for people who own bitcoin? That's how 2008 happened. You need to speak to short sellers to understand the arguments against it, and they probably aren't going to bitcoin conferences.
