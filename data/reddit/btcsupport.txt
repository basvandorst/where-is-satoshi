I am not sure about bitcore, but if you can export the raw transaction, you can broadcast it for example here:

Can you export the private key from the wallet?

This is basically down to Coinbase not allowing for non-priority transactions. Lightning is one option that should be available in 2018, another is SegWit transactions that are unfortunately not supported by Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:32:20
The most secure way is probably bisq.network. However, it does require some sophistication and understanding (at the moment). Otherwise you can try Xapo or Uphold for more convenience.

No transaction found with the hash 0e0dde964d366a09ab7556a3ac4752d92799e24e5d87e0c12a834933797efe33
I think this never made it into the mempool. Did you try to manually broadcast the transaction?

Somebody is solving a big puzzle, and this will only aid them. People did all sort of things without understanding the long term consequences. How do you know what is legal where this person is? 
What if this is connected to a bigger stash and somebody goes through his Reddit history and is able to identify him? What if he lives in a less safe country where it is worth to kill him for 10 BTC? - Please do not put other people in harms way for such minor issues.


Exactly, this is the easiest way. RBF is only helpful if he has more bitcoin, which we don't know and which is needlessly complicated if you can just send the transaction again.

It is unlikely that there was a cloud mining service available at this time. Otherwise, go to Bitcointalk and search old entries. 
If it existed, somebody would have mentioned it there.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:23:47
You want to double spent the transaction with a higher fee.
As you are using the Bitcoin Core, go to the transaction history and abandon the 'stuck' transaction. Now do it again with a slightly higher fee. You certainly don't need 400 Sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:09:12
If you just want to hodle, spend some time to understand Electrum, send a small amount to your Electrum wallet, make sure it is encrypted and backed up, get comfortable and move the rest off the exchange.
You can also create a paper wallet if you are more comfortable with that.
Importantly, make sure that inheritance is sorted out in case you have an accident. Hardware wallets are useful in case you want to make many transactions and you are not comfortable with computers.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:53:55
Yes, it should be generally be safe but it is not fully supported yet.
Note:   
- Native segwit scripts are represented using bech32 addresses, following BIP173. Please note that BIP173 is still in draft status, and that other wallets/websites may not support it. Thus, you should keep a non-segwit wallet in order to be able to receive bitcoins during the transition period. If BIP173 ends up being rejected or substantially modified, your wallet may have to be restored from seed. This will not affect funds sent to bech32 addresses, and it will not affect the capacity of Electrum to spend these funds.

Possible scam, you won't have any recourse.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:04:52
You should not post addresses here for your own safety.
Just look for the address that received the Bitcoin in the blockexplorer. It should show you which transaction went in, and which ones went out.
Can you confirm that you received the bitcoin? Did you send them to another address that you control, or somebody else?
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:06:16
A transaction is usually confirmed after 10 min. if the attached fees are high enough to entice the miner to include the transaction.
Depending on how many other like to transact at the time, the competition can be tight. If you need more info look at the specific transaction fee you paid and compare it to the current backlog, e.g.: bitcoinfees.earn.com
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:57:59
    "BTC": "0.0005",
That's all there is, including transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:10:40
The transaction will go through eventually, depending on how urgently you need the funds you could just let it hang in there. Some people are comfortable to wait 4 weeks and save on the fees.
Otherwise I would suggest that you double-spend the transaction and increase the the fee slightly. This may be easier with some wallets (?) and rather complicated with others. Essentially you just send the transaction again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:09:30
Also, never leave your Bitcoin on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:51:48
Not the best choice. I suppose what happened is that the wallet uses the UTXO to show the right amount but it misses some incoming transactions. 
Possibly old ones, say you received Bitcoin in 2011, blockchain.info may not have a complete record and omitted those. If you export the private keys and import them in Electrum, for example, you would probably see all transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:17:21
Eventually, fiat will be history. At this point you can compare the future purchasing power of your Bitcoin at t1 to the possible Bitcoin you receive for your investment at t1.
In simple terms, think about it like money that is intrinsically linked to the S&amp;P500. You can still invest in growth stocks and beat the 'index'.

This is hard to say, best is to check with a blockchain explorer (e.g.  and see if it was broadcasted.


Current estimate is 4-109 ( with 1 sat/byte it can potentially take days or even weeks.


You can double-spend the transaction with a higher transaction fee. You can accelerate the transaction with RBF (increase the fee)


No, eventually it will clear, you can send more transactions to this address if desired.
Plenty of people (hodlers) do those kind of transactions between their own accounts to safe fees (not time sensitive).
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:58:13
It is advisable to be **very** careful. 
I have used this one successfully.
If it is a meaningful amount I would highly recommend to follow the security check-list, e.g. only use the offline version.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:56:17
That's very kind of you to support the network. An old computer will do, just consider that the blockchain may grow and you should have at least 200GB HDD space available at the moment.
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:02:31
It is probably best if you just install Electrum and create a wallet. You don't need to add any funds to get a feeling for it.
In short, you have to make sure to back-up the private keys (or seed phrase).
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:48:05
Great work!!!

Best is to see what is happening on the blockchain and in the mempool. 
Past the transaction ID or the receiving address into a blockexplorer (e.g.  and see if it is in mempool ready to be transmitted (or possibly gone to a different address?).
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:31:50
What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:21:29
DO NOT POST YOUR TRANSACTION ID IN PUBLIC FORUMS.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:54:44
Technically yes. However, the wallet may not let you do this because it sees that funds are already reserved.
Just try to select the inputs manually and see if you can make another transaction. Otherwise, look under the "Transactions" tab, right click the unconfirmed transaction and select "Abandon transaction".
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:25:39
That is very unfortunate to hear that your experience was lacking. Suppose your expectations didn't conform with reality, it is probably a good idea to stick to the means you understand best. - Bitcoin is still in a very early stage, imagine the horrible experience people had with electricity during the first years?


It is probably least useful for petty purchases at its current stage.


Apparently does not support Bitcoin at the moment, you could have ventured out to purse.io.


Maybe you can make the bitcoins a Christmas gift for a more tech-savvy friend of yours?


Don't trust centralized exchanges, just like you don't leave your car open. An expensive lessen many have to learn.


You misunderstand how money works, you didn't receive money over Paypal. You received a promise that was worth nothing. Your counterparty received money. - Say, did you choose the Paypal option because the exchange rate was much more promising and you were in fact avaricious instead of restrained? It couldn't have been the only offer on the market? 


Instead, you are self-reflective?


No, it's the most liberating experience I ever had.


Store of value.


I wish you well, you are always welcome.

You need to extract the private key and import it into a Bcash wallet.
Multibit is more complicated as it seems. See if that works for you:
**How to export the private keys in a wallet**
- In the 'Wallets' side panel choose the wallet you want to export the private keys for.
- Select the menu option 'Tools | Export Private Keys'. The 'Export Private Keys' screen appears.
- By default, the private keys file is called the same as your wallet file, only with an extension 'key' rather than wallet.
- If you want to output the private key file to a different directory or filename click on the 'Export to. . .' button. A file chooser opens and you can select the file to save to.
- It is strongly recommended that you password protect your private key export files. To do this, click on the 'Password - protect export file' radio button. Enter the password you want to use in the 'Password' field and then repeat the same password in the 'Repeat password' field. If they match you get a little green tick on the right hand side.
- To output the private keys to the output file specified, click on the button 'Export private keys'. The private key file is written and a success message appears. If the export of the private key file fails for any reason the error message is given on screen.
- After the export file is written, it is then verified by reading the file back in again and checking the keys in the file match the keys in the wallet. A verification message is given if this is successful.

Every transaction is composed of 1 or more inputs. Those inputs are the 'outputs' from a previous transaction.
You can have 10 different inputs in your wallet and spend 5 on one transaction and another 3 on a second transaction whenever you want.
The person with the pending transaction, can in theory, use those 'unconfirmed' outputs as input for another transaction. However, some wallet implementation don't permit this because the risk of double-spending increases.
The recipient can accelerate the reception by attaching a high fee to the next transaction, thereby incentivising miners to include both, the child and the parent transaction in a block (CPFP = child pays for parent).
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:49:49
HD wallets use a single key to generate an entire tree of key pairs. Your seed is the "root" of the tree.
Several wallets allow you to export the private key as well as your 'Seed' phrase. Electrum, for example makes this easy.

Right, you will probably want some professional help with that.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:47:47


Whatever works best for you. There is no perfect solution here.


Many people have done that, consider 2 aspects, security and inheritance. In terms of security, choose what you are most comfortable with, a paper wallet can be a great idea if you can store it safely. You can also use Electrum and backup the wallet. In either case, make sure that you have more than one copy of your private keys/wallet.
In terms of inheritance, make sure somebody trusted can get hold of it in case you are unavailable to access the wallet.


You are save if you have the private keys yourself, like you would with a paper wallet. As for exchanges, it is highly recommended no to leave funds on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:12:28
No.

bisq.network is mostly P2P and provides this functionality on your own risk.
The problem is usually to find an appropriate price feed, people could content that the executed price wasn't actually what they expected, different exchanges have different prices.
In addition, the reference could be either Bid/Mid/Ask, which can differ substantially.
Edit: correct link

It depends on how sophisticated the business is. Many just print out a QR code and pin it at the counter.
Online businesses can set-up a simple wallet as well and just work through it manually, considering that you may only get one transaction now and than.
More professional options are also available, e.g. by globee.com

You always send the change to yourself. You could send it also back to the original address, "1Mhz2VipTZU9NebBwjZh7whpDYwCpWLjmw", in your example.
However, to protect your privacy, it is better always use a different address to make it harder for others to analyse your transaction history.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:49:49
Jaxx Wallet may not use an optimal way to determine transactions fees.
It is best to use a wallet that allows you to set the fees yourself. Currently it should be quite cheap, i.e. 10-20 Satoshi/byte.
Note, the more inputs you have, the more data is required for your transaction and the higher the fees are. You seem to have 6 inputs.

The easiest is probably to migrate your Bitcoin to Bitcoin Core and manually update the blockchain now and then.

A transaction typically references previous transaction outputs as new transaction inputs and dedicates all input Bitcoin values to new outputs.


Looking at transaction "e6c70e798cf1c47dbe1f890c2b532f3499d442ff6f7b7255b1cd34ba3a13e2b7": 
- 1Mhz2VipTZU9NebBwjZh7whpDYwCpWLjmw 0 (Output) 0.5 BTC
- 13o62QALH3atv7ScGii8spzV7TKcsFG4Hv - (Spent) 0.48724111 BTC
- 1Fc5nhYTUuyxronCXaQQvK8FPeFCff1QWk - (Unspent) 0.01208089 BTC
The owner of the wallet has access 2 addresses:
- 1Mhz2VipTZU9NebBwjZh7whpDYwCpWLjmw - Now 0.0 BTC
- 1Fc5nhYTUuyxronCXaQQvK8FPeFCff1QWk - Now 0.01208089 BTC
PS: It is also possible to design more complex types of transactions.

Download the blockchain and copy it to the cold storage computer. 
Run 'bitcoind' with the blockchain, in electrum, select "Tools" -&gt; "Network" -&gt; Uncheck "Select server automatically" -&gt; go to "Server" tab -&gt; specify localhost.
EDIT: Sorry, just tried it, not that easy, you need to run an Electrum server:

Yes. You can not broadcast those transactions and wait until you find a block (which may take some time with 6 miners).
Once you generate the new block, its content, is at your discretion. You can add only your transactions or join them with others available in the mempool.

You won't make a profit in something like this because you will sell as soon as it is profitable. With this mindset, you would buy a $1 BTC and sell it for $2 ... and certainly for $10.


See if you can work for Bitcoin in some capacity, earn.com is a simple start that can bring in little. Otherwise consider hodlhodl or Bisq to purchase some coin regularly.
