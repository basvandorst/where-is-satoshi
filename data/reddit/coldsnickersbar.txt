This is paranoid and shows a lack of knowledge of history. After only a short time of being a history fan, I've been deeply affected by how unremarkable and ordinary our politics are. Humans do do what we do to ourselves without any help from cartoon villains. There's no one in control and there never has been.

I don't want to single you out, but I'm amazed you've never heard of This American Life.
It's an NPR radio program that has been going since the '90s. The premise of the program is investigative journalism of individual Americans. They do intense stories about individuals from the famous to the common, covering topics from PTSD to amazing coincidences. Sometimes, their shows are groundbreaking interviews, such as the inside look at Apple's manufacturing in China that landed on news everywhere and hurt stock prices (and the even more dramatic retraction of it when it turned out the subject was a liar); sometimes they're of whisleblowers and sometimes they're detailed recountings of kidnappings or lotto winners, or an inside look at local government.
For instance, one amazing episode was about a janitor that terrorized an entire school faculty and become a strange kind of kingpin, running a weird mobster like crew that intimidated teachers and students alike. Another good one was about a gang of soccer moms that took up PI work, but then the story turned out to be not what it seemed.
It's received numerous awards over its almost 20-year life: 
This is like meeting someone who's never heard of Star Wars. I'm not trying to be mean, but it's remarkable.

I don't think you've looked up that word, "proof".

They're going to do a full episode of This American Life about it this weekend. It's already in the mainstream.

You know, it's possible to have Bitcoin without it being a casino.
EDIT: Also, "bear market", are you joking? It was at 3k literally this summer.

Now I'm more confused. Why would the bourgeoisie invent May Day?

Huh. I mean, is there a nuisance of hangovers on May Day in Sweeden?

It's not entrapment to merely offer an opportunity to commit a crime. Otherwise, every sting ever would be entrapment. In that hypothetical example, the undercover officer offered incidental information that the target is committing a crime, and then, with no pressure at all, the target commits the crime anyway. There couldn't be an example further from entrapment than that. That's simply an officer going to a person they suspect of committing crimes anyway, providing an opportunity to see it happen, and then recording it for evidence.
It's only entrapment when you can demonstrate that the officer *convinced* the sting target to commit a crime that they wouldn't have otherwise committed. And to whom do you have to demonstrate this? A jury, in the end, but maybe an appellate court after the fact. Things such as pleading, begging, harassing, or even threatening the target, are what is typically considered entrapment. If the officer had offered up the fact that this is a crime, and then the subject said "oh, well then, no, I won't do it," and then the officer started trying to *convince him* to do it, then there'd be a good argument that it was entrapment.

is typically, uh, *slanted* toward Bitcoin Cash, while sees Bitcoin Cash as ... well, not as good as Bitcoin.
This leads to a hilarious situation where, on you have headlines like "BTC is the new shitcoin", because they often hate on Bitcoin, which has the ticker "BTC", but their subreddit is ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Plus, McDonalds will often not have to ever redeem them. They expire, and they're more often lost or destroyed than dollars are. Most of the time, they hand them out and it buys what *they want*: your appeasement, but then they never have to deliver.

I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic at this point and in this fucked up situation the world is in.

This is why every century is doomed to glorify the previous century's wars.
It's like, if you took a grid of thousands of lit candles and a rainstorm hit it, the candles that remain are like the survivors of WWII. Only the survivors themselves know just how dangerous it was and just how many died and just how lucky they were. As the survivors themselves pass away in our time now, we're left with our god damn video games and movies to tell us what it was like. And so, next century, we'll probably repeat it while thinking we're all going to magically be one of the few that makes it out on top. Even in our time, with our media, we still can't stop this cycle.

It's only about $30k worth. He didn't declare that he bought millions. Sometimes things actually happen, and it's not too outrageous to think that a person spent $30k on a thing. That's hardly remarkable.

Still doesn't mean it didnt happen. It's just not that strange.

Oh, you guys. You're talking right past each other in an "if by whiskey" fashion. 
The only thing to solve it would be to understand eachother's definitions, and then I bet you'd find you actually agree. What if you define "greed" to mean the *sin of greed*? As in: not merely seeking benefit for yourself, but also seeking it in spite of harm to others. The definition of greed, as a sin, throughout history, has implied going beyond, being obscene, being wasteful, or taking more than your share. The definition most people use for "greed" is as anti-social behavior. If you use that definition, which most people do, then what *you're* describing isn't "greed" but rather "self interest", which is often pro-social. 
For instance: 
* it's "self interested" to want to become a doctor, and it's also very pro-social behavior. 
* It's greedy and anti-social to spread pseudo-science in order to sell fake medicine.
* It's self-interested and pro-social to found a ride sharing company that makes innovations in the price and availability of rides
* It's greedy for that same service to ignore and avoid local laws to underpay drivers
* It's self-interested and pro-social get yourself off of a dangerous addiction
* It's greedy and anti-social to sell crack to your own neighborhood to fleece it of its wealth. 
* It's self-interested and pro-social to invest in a technology you believe in. 
* It's greedy to invent a financial product that hides subprime investments into bonds to deceive 401k holders into taking on all your risks while you make the profits
* It's self-interested to invent a way of cleaning pollution that you can sell as a service to cities
* It's greedy to pollute a river and accept the fines because they're less than the profits while also lobbying to keep the fines low, despite the harm to the town over. 
* It's self-interested to hold steady employment to support yourself and your children. 
* It's greedy and anti-social to exploit loopholes in government assistance programs to avoid having to work.
* It's self-interested and pro-social to start a smoking cessation program at your business to reduce your health insurance overhead.
* It's greedy to lobby that smoking doesn't cause lung cancer in order to continue selling cigarettes. 
* It's both self-interested and also pro-social to microlend to impoverished communities as part of your bonds portfolio (if you do it at 0% interest, it's not self-interested, but rather altruistic). 
* It's greedy to exploit local labor laws to steal wages from the desperately poor
* It's self-interested and pro-social to lend money to sound debtors for reasonable things, such as homes, school, cars, and businesses, and with reasonable mitigations to which they can turn if they can't repay the loan
* It's greedy to lend to desperate people at exploitative rates and then intimidate them into paying you more than they can afford and keep them underwater and also paying a never ending cycle of fees

"Literally" now literally means it's literal opposite.
