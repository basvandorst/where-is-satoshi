Yes. That is why the block size should be increased.

Fork it.

You are not wrong.   
I just find the justifications eerily similar to 2017; Wall street bonuses. Chinese new year. Now it is institutions buying, retail not in, another 10x at least.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:08:15
muh institutions

The difference between now and 2017 is that Bitcoin had lost almost all its fame after the 2013 bubble, it was a new thing 'again'. Now the rektage is still fresh in mind for most people.
It sounds like Wall Street Bonuses and Chinese New Year in here again.  
\++ you are applying the same exact metrics of 2017 to the current situation. It probably won't manifest in the exact same way.

But you don't get it. The tether is being used induce the FOMO to make people buy with fiat. Also market cap doesn't equal money flowing in.

You are wrong.

No, they are likely just speculating in the value that it will go up if the hold the coins after purchase.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:55:39
Didn’t know that! Cool.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:42:49
Ding ding
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:58:30
retail is already in. cmon. might be some more suckers out there, but they'll only join after media starts shilling again.

Holding ETH obviously.

Well, there is still the process of getting the money from the CC company, to your bank account, to the exchange + accounting and all that. 
I run a small web development business and I would love to get paid and have everything settled in one go.

IN MUTABILITY WE TRUST
MUH DIGITAL GOLD

Then you would have to get that money, either in cash or via a credit card to an exchange account and purchase your crypto of choice.

Would hardly call the developments since April 'steady growth' It is similar to the 2017 bubble on a non-log chart.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:28:49
There are already working decentralized exchanges (EtherDelta) and casino games (FunFair) on Ethereum .
But hey, it’s just a shitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:46:44
The con is pretty great actually. As far as I understand they are collecting ETH for EOS -&gt; Selling EOS for ETH -&gt; Creating false demand for EOS -&gt; Collecting more ETH. All the while dumping ETH for Fiat.
