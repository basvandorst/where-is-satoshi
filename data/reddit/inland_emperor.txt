Will their wallets be SegWit and will they batch transactions?

What do you suggest I invest in?
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:35:07
I hope it includes subtitles
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:06:38
No one knows where the price is gonna go. 
My personal, poorly informed opinion? I’d buy and hold for at least a year (if you can live with possibly losing your $1,000) Don’t try to make a quick buck. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:05:30
I’m fairly certain it’s an “article” written by a bot. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:28:53
Papa knows!
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:47:08
Yeah, that must suck. ��
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:14:53
I don’t understand what any of this means.

I use a Trezor. I love it!

I’m in this long term. I either pay off my house or I lose all the money I’ve put in.

It’s instant and there’s no fee to transfer. There are fees when buying and selling on Coinbase Pro, but they are MUCH lower than they are on Coinbase.

I would assume it’s treated just like any other property and considered community property that would need to be split between the couple divorcing unless there’s a signed prenup. But I’m not qualified to say one way or the other. If you’re asking for legal reasons, consult an attorney.

Welcome aboard!
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:09:37
This isn’t my first purchase. I’ve been in since since September 2017 and have never sold. I know how this game works. My hands are strong. Yesterday’s purchase was to put me over the top into an exclusive club, so you’ll have to look for someone else’s coins to sweep up, brother.
@_date: 2019-07-28 04:21:42
I believe bitcoin is worth about $9,400.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:30:31
I called my stockbroker last year and asked him if I could use money in my IRA to buy Bitcoin. He said no, so I took a small withdrawal, gladly paid the taxes and the 10% penalty and bought bitcoin. I’ve more than made up for the hit I took pulling it out early. If it keeps going I might soon have more retirement $ in bitcoin than I do in my IRA.

Rule  ALL IN, BABY! I’m gonna be rich! To the moon!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:52:27
I wish I would’ve known about that route. Oh well...I’m just glad I got in when I did. I can’t wait to see how bitcoin and blockchain change the world!
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:23:01
I needed to read this tonight. I bought in a few months ago and my value has tripled since. A big part of me fears that the bubble is gonna pop and I’m gonna lose all of my gains. My head tells me to hodl, but my weak hands tell me to sell.
I believe in bitcoin and it’s world-changing possibilities, it’s just that all of this FUD about transaction fees and bubble talk has got me down. I think I just needed some encouragement that I’m doing the right thing by holding. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:35:26
This really is an excellent video!
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:18:36
You’re right. It dropped to $2500 for an hour and then shot up over the next three months to $14K. I was a fool to buy any at all.
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:18:44
Congrats! I too am a bag holder.

Not to be THAT guy, but the saying actually goes, “For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.”
It’s not the money that’s evil, it’s when you love money that it can make you do all kinds of evil things.

Glenn Beck wasn’t fired. He left to start his own internet empire, The Blaze, after his contract with Fox News was up. He’s a believer in Bitcoin and the reason I started buying in. Glenn Beck is great!! 
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:37:52
Ah hell yeah!!! I bought the dip at $9390! Caught that falling knife just before it hit the ground.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:48:55
It will dip eventually. Below what it's at now? Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:52:49
No, that’s not how it works. I only would’ve lost if I sold while it was down. I’m still holding.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:57:56
I bought at the all time high of $4300
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:25

And? How are things going for you now? 
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:32:24
I had to google that to know what you were talking about and that fact means that I really have no business trading. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:25:54
It hurts...it hurts bad

@_date: 2018-08-23 01:27:11
Duly noted. Thanks
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:30:20
Yeah, I guess I do. A little. I really should know better.
@_date: 2018-05-04 22:31:07
Good. Then can they NOT crash and kill the next $20K bull run please?
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:26:25
But to accumulate, I’d have to break the “don’t put in more than you can afford to lose” rule. That’s my dilemma.
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:46:36
Solid advice! I’m not prepared for it
@_date: 2018-08-30 06:34:40
John was the walrus
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:13:44
Alright...I’m not selling, I’m hodling. But I guess I’m also not buying anymore because I’ve put in what I can afford to lose.
Sadly, it looks like I’m never gonna reach the 21M club.
@_date: 2018-05-25 03:03:31
I’m new to Bitcoin too (Sept ‘17) and I often wonder the same thing. Then I’ll watch an interview of Roger Ver and decide I’m making the right choice by staying away from Bcash.
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:29:06
You’ve got enthusiasm, I’ll give you that.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:41:59

@_date: 2019-11-26 13:24:20
These guys make a great series of videos to explain bitcoin, hardware wallets and more. Watch these:
@_date: 2018-10-31 02:42:11
Ugh...5 years til Lambo?!?
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:13:56
So has your mom
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:18:35
Right. And since he’s from the future he has the knowledge of what   bitcoin’s price will be, but what if, by traveling back in time, he created an alternate timeline and now we’re not living in the timeline where bitcoin reaches $100,000 by the end of 2019?
@_date: 2018-06-16 02:11:13
Sounds like he’s getting into Shitcoins
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:12:35
THAT’S why you’re calling b.s.?! Not the fact that the dude claims he’s a time traveler?!
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:12:29
The price has been down for weeks with no good memes. This one was posted today and the price is up $250.
Coincidence? I think not!
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:50:43
Well now I’m not sure WHO to believe!
@_date: 2019-10-09 05:09:54
Were they successful?
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:47:02
But does this coincide with what the Time Traveler promised us will happen?
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:55:27
He drunkenly claimed on a twitter post the other day that he was broke.
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:13:56
I put all my money into your feeling. Fingers crossed!
@_date: 2019-10-29 21:50:28
I’ve been hodling since September of 2017. I plan on continuing, but I’m still not certain that I’m not gambling.
@_date: 2019-10-29 21:52:18
No thank you! I’ve watched other get completely rekt from trading.
@_date: 2019-10-29 04:33:36
I already feel like I’m gambling just by owning bitcoin. I don’t need to make it even worse.
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:12:26
And now I’m blind from trying to read that. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:52:48
We all missed our last chance to buy it under 10k /s
@_date: 2019-10-04 01:50:08
I hope so. My “moon” is paying off my house and that’d do it.
@_date: 2019-06-06 07:24:00
Goodnight. When I wake up I hope to see you’re right.
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:46:44
Feels good! $9k, here we come!
@_date: 2019-10-29 05:11:21
If I wanted to do that I’d day trade.
@_date: 2019-10-27 02:25:44
Congratulations! Bitcoin literally helped change your life.
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:51:44
I don’t think the media will go insane until after it reaches a new all time high. $10k means it’s still down 50% from the top.
@_date: 2019-10-09 05:06:26
“Meme prediction”?!?
This was the prophecy foretold by 4Chan. We still have a few weeks for it to come true, but it’s looking more and more like Anon was a false prophet.
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:06:58
I don’t understand what a node is. I figured out how to buy bitcoin and keep it safe with a Trezor, but I don’t think I’m tech savvy enough to do much more than that.
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:26:09
Whoever’s in charge of naming LA street gangs is really phoning it in with that one.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:04:24
I hear BitconnectCoin is a good one. Maybe Bitcoiin2Gen. Steven Seagal recommends it. BitcoinCash...so many to choose from!
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:36:59
I overslept. Looks like you were right!!!
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:42:27
Bitcoin is now safely in my Trezor. Whew!!! 
Looks like I'm going to sleep tonight after all.
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:42:04
Cool! I’ll check it out. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:03:29
Too late. Sorry :-(
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:26:42
I’m curious to know if anyone took you up on this. Got a link to your YouTube?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:07:03
Did the guy cash out? What if he’s still hodling and cashes out during a drop? He ain’t out of the woods yet.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:23:18
That makes me feel much better for the guy. He’s not an idiot after all. He got the ball rolling. He’s a hero!
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:04:59
I plan on being a long time holder. I think I'm gonna be okay. Fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:31:12
Just bought some at $8865. Was waiting all day Friday and Saturday for the dip that never came. Figured I'd better jump in or miss the rocket to 10K.
Now I'm just waiting (2 hours!!!) for my bitcoin to show up in my Trezor from GDAX. Where is it? I'm scared! It's always just automatically shown up before. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:41:57
Thanks, brother. I appreciate it! Good luck on your Lambo dreams and Tesla wishes also. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:25:55
Glad to see that it's not just me. I've been waiting about two hours for mine to show up.
@_date: 2019-06-08 23:01:09
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:07:27
Sorry for this shitpost
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:07:51
I laughed way too hard at that!
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:35:10
Sorry, that was my fault. I bought some BTC today which, of course, means the price immediately goes down afterwards.
I’ll give you guys a heads up next time before I buy.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:20:02
Sell it all at 10k and put it into FaceCoin
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:24:28
Seriously, WTF?!?
I've got money to buy and I'm waiting for the dip.
As soon as I buy, that's when it'll dip.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:32:32
If I lost the money I've put in it would hurt, but it wouldn't be devastating. I don't necessarily want to put anymore in though in case the thing tanks.
If it ever gets up high enough in value where I can pay off my mortgage with it, I'd definitely have to at least consider selling it at that point (no Lambo for me...waste of money!). That's my life's dream, to finally own my home outright. But Bitcoin would have to be valued at almost $500,000/BTC. I don't know if it'll ever get that high, so in the meantime, I'm gonna sit back and enjoy the ride.  
I bought some for my kids too as an investment. They're 12 and 9, so I'm really excited to see where the value of it will be for them in 10 years. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:32:59
It finally came through. Whew!! Took about 2 and 1/2 hours.
@_date: 2019-12-11 07:07:07
(Is that still a thing?)
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:57:42
I buy on GDAX. I've read that their price is higher than others, but I've only been in the game for 2 months and I'm not familiar with bitstamp.
 It's currently at $8,912.05 on GDAX, so as far as that goes, I'm in the positive. 
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:09:44
Now I’m up $150
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:13:10
Here’s a step by step guide on how to trade:
1)buy bitcoin
2)FOMO buy more bitcoin when the price goes up high
3)wait for bitcoin price to drop
4)panic sell your bitcoin when the price goes down low
5)repeat steps 2-4
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:46:37
Congrats! No matter how much you have though, it’s never enough.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:35:46
Congrats! At these prices I don't think I'll ever be in the 21Million Club. 
@_date: 2019-06-13 20:14:16
Not that I’m aware of, but he makes me feel good about bitcoin so I like him.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:41:28
If I'm doing the maths right, my average is $6,572.50
@_date: 2019-12-06 07:43:50
The reason he came to you was because he’s looking for a sucker that he can scam. It’s 100% a scam. Report him and block him.
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:58:22
I need $1,000,000,000,000,000 before 2039 though for a thing I’m working on.
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:11:31
Shit! I need that money before 2039
@_date: 2019-12-06 07:48:13
At this price I’m down $35.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:30:10
I’ve got all these chips but I can’t buy any dip
@_date: 2019-12-03 01:14:49
Sounds like a scam to me. I’d stay away from it.
@_date: 2019-04-05 14:02:51
Probably neither
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:28:20
How do you acquire it?
Do you have to use bitcoin to buy it? If so, it’s a scam.
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:23:26
Doesn’t it feel more like sucking a dick than it does getting your dick sucked?
@_date: 2019-10-02 06:07:21
I do. I spent $510 in 2017 on ETH to diversify my crypto holdings. Today that ETH is only worth $350. I got rekt. I should’ve put that money into BTC instead.
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:14:50
“Hey hey heeeeeeey...”
@_date: 2019-01-18 19:29:11
Memes brought me here. I like them.
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:33:27
I'm buying for the long term investment and I'm using Coinbase to buy. I barely understand how THAT works let alone what GDAX is. I'm reading that I should transfer my BTC from Coinbase to a paper wallet. Should I not even bother with Coinbase? This is all new to me and pretty intimidating, but I can see the potential in cryptocurrency and don't want to miss out. I feel like Coinbase is a good start for a beginner like me. 
 
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:58:10
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:52:09
You’re good for now, but I’ve seen the price drop $1500 overnight so being good now doesn’t mean a whole lot.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:49:30
I used one of these same machines in Fontana, CA and it charged me 13.3%.
What a gyp. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:06:33
It can be confusing and seem pretty overwhelming for a newcomer. Especially one who's not exceptionally tech-savvy. It took a lot of reading and video watching to learn the basics. If you want me to help explain what I learned to you, send me a DM. 
Or maybe start a thread of your own. The people in this subreddit are really friendly and helpful. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:13:32
Fingers crossed
@_date: 2017-09-05 09:29:26
Okay, GDAX sounds like the way to go. I'm going to check it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:12:29
Watching it drop $100+ an hour after I bought it made my heart sink a little, I'll be honest, but its now up above what I bought it at. That makes me feel better. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:09:58
I like this idea. I know how to transfer Bitcoin into my account, but as far as using it in a store to purchase something, I'm clueless. Where can I find a place that accepts Bitcoin as payment?
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:59:13
I still haven’t grasped the concept of 1btc=1btc yet.
Maybe because I haven’t used it to buy anything and also because I can’t use my btc to pay my mortgage...yet.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:14:55
I took this advice last month. It’s worse now.

Okay, that's good advice. I'll learn more about a Tor browser for future use. Thank you!
Doesn't the way a Trezor works protect you from possible malware though?
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:29:04
Oh, that's good to know. Thank you!

I wrote down the seed words on the papers provided with the Trezor. I have one in a safe here at my house and one in my dad's safe at his house. I'll edit my OP.
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:14:56
This didn’t age well.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:08:25
More people are selling than buying.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:13:26
VPN/Tor? I'm sorry, I don't speak your language. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 04:58:30
If I can afford to pay off my house. $200K/BTC or so.
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:44:32
This aged well
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:16:12
But not the dip before that one. Yet...
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:48:14
It was probably written by a computer program 
@_date: 2019-09-29 02:07:49
I don’t know, but it’s a better time than the last time I bought.
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:21:20
Me too.
@_date: 2019-09-03 08:44:09
This is what I’m hoping for.

What did you guys do?!?

Yes, bitcoin is almost certainly going to crash, but nobody knows when or at what price. It may crash from $8000 down to $0 or it may crash from $100,000 down to $20,000. It will crash.
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:50:13
I’m still a noob in crypto. Why did he have to shut down? Was the cost to keep mining more expensive than the bitcoin he was getting in return?
