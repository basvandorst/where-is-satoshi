That will mean 1 BTC = 1 million USD. I don't think it is coming anytime soon- not in 20 years' time IMO.
@_date: 2015-12-08 08:45:03
Did you mean 420,000th block, when reward halving happens?
Is there anything special happening after block 400,000 has been mined?

Do you mean something like [this](

This is just another pump and dump. Sell now and buy in 2 days' time! 
Traders need the up and down to gain profit.

Very generous gentleman.
150 bits @_date: 2014-11-14 03:50:09
Yes, the paid-outs have been received. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:25:53
With the current inflation rate, yes, 1 BTC should worth $1,000,000 soon. 
But 1 loaf of bread may cost you $10,000...

Maybe Satoshi will not "cash out" the bitcoin into dollars. When he cash out, bitcoin will already be a currency that can be used as it is.

Not sure how this will help bitcoin to the moon. Just another exchange (JAE?). 
Unless they have any plan that will help the grandmas and grandpas (mainstream) to adopt bitcoins....
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:50:13
great job BRA|N!
@_date: 2016-03-24 23:43:19
Because it is.
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:11:32
Ha... At the current rate, it will be at most 40% on 3rd April...
@_date: 2016-01-28 02:10:35
but each device will also carry less BTC due to the high value...
@_date: 2015-05-14 07:22:32
@_date: 2016-01-27 03:11:47
Oh no... This means I will not enjoy the success of bitcoin... Damn! I will stop saving now!

I will exchange the 1 BTU with Roger Ver to get 2 BTC (in case of a HF). 
HF or non-HF, I will then split the coins equally to every one commented here before 7PM Pacific time on 31st March! 
Vote for me!
EDIT: Only within minutes I already have negative scores!!!
@_date: 2016-06-14 07:56:33
Wow! She must be rich! 3k BTC is more than 2 millions!
@_date: 2016-06-14 07:54:29
I bought some when it was in the $1000+... I guess it is still consider cheap now...
@_date: 2018-10-12 07:19:57
Is bitcoin popular in Singapore given their strong and stable currency? What is the estimate "bitcoiner" population there?
@_date: 2016-11-16 01:40:30
Is this considered as market manipulation? If you are only paying about $500 (just my guess) to mine each coin and selling it at $1,000,000... 
I am sure the buyer will start thinking to start mining OR other miners are actually willing to sell each coin at much lower price... Supply (+cost of mining) and demand...
@_date: 2016-12-28 07:26:39
The price at Chinese exchanges stopped at around 980+... I guess the current wave has slow down a bit... 
@_date: 2016-11-29 23:44:55
That's 0.04BTC! What were you mining with? CPU, GPU, 333MH ASIC or cloud mining? 
@_date: 2016-12-29 07:28:32
So did Trump ban bitcoin in China??
@_date: 2016-12-28 03:55:14
He is just a kid... I guess he just sold a very small % of his BTC and still keeping most... 
@_date: 2016-12-21 08:27:36
Wow.... This is scary! Any reason for the huge drop from $800 to $200?
@_date: 2016-12-29 07:23:18
Wow! Even with this "latest news", the price at Houbi still reached USD 1000! Amazing!
@_date: 2016-12-22 07:12:15
The possibility is very high now!
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:33:39
The highs in June were due to Brexit and was only momentarily. We are looking at a sustainable record high at the moment!
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:04:34
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:20:19
Has anyone been r4p3 by the OP?? Oh well, I guess there is still high chance that we will reach $1,000 in these few days...
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:08:42
It might go back down to 780-790 but the trend suggest that the up trend will continue...
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:07:24
Wow! 60 bits actually worth lot... in 2070!

I am getting ready to buy as many bitcoin as I can afford, if it ever dropped below $1000. Unfortunately, Mr Wright can only do that once.....
@_date: 2016-11-22 08:22:20
Oh well, we should translate this into Chinese to capture the attention of the majority of the miners....
@_date: 2015-08-28 04:22:11
if you know the public keys, you can look at the balance in blockexplorer or blockchain.info

@_date: 2015-08-04 10:14:32
This is fine. However, I think information in the references is equally important in scientific publications, so please check carefully.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:13:23
Very easy.
Go to 
Put your key into the very first input box, Section 1 (Wallet import format to private key),  like: 5HueCGU8rMjxEXxiPuD5BDku4MkFqeZyd4dZ1jvhTVqvbTLvxxx, where xxx is unknown.
Click send.
Then you will have the correctly calculated key in Section 2 (Private key to wallet import format),

Nice paper.
The one typo (maybe not) that I spotted in your reference:
"22 Peter Wuille showed via simulation that miners connected with fast channels can earn a greater profit per
hash than miners connected over slower channels. This is in-line with the results presented in this paper, as
a miner with faster communication channels would have a lower cost of production yet select transactions
from the essentially the same mempool demand curve, thereby earning a greater surplus. Source:
I think it should read "Pieter Wuille" not "Peter Wuille".

Great job! Too bad, I was away for the past few days and late to the party! Looking forward to more of this type of challenges in near future! 
BTW, what is the meaning of "Verde Es Loco(5150 Ångstroms)"??

Ha... my guess is 7890...
Good luck!

$273 (current price) * 2 = $546 due to reward halving

Everyone has a price target... I am sure when the price increase from today's 4k+ to 5k+, many will sell to secure the profit. Besides, miners can't wait as they need to pay electricity bill- they need to sell.
Just like you, I have my price target too, but it is much lower than 100k.
