Haha, yes, let us return to the days of privately funded fire stations that would simply let your house burn to the ground if you hadn't paid your dues. /s

It is true of basically every social requirement that cannot be made to be *profitable*. That is the only venue in which competition in a capital market is of benefit.
Who is going to monitor pollution and regulate industries that would be more than willing to fuck up the environment for short-term profits.
Who is going to take on the task of *responsibly removing* asbestos from all our hospitals and elementary schools built 50-100 years ago?
It is good that OP has asked this question and is seeking out *reasoned arguments* to the contrary, but the fact that so many people just adopt the absolutist view that "taxation is theft" is beyond me. How about we give your job and spot in society to some Syrian refugee that is more than happy to work happy and diligently fully aware that both "needs" and "wants" have to be addressed via different avenues.

No, it isn't going to change much of anything. Media exposure isn't going to change the speed of development...it takes *time* and *work* that move substantially slower than Jack Dorsey's opinion on Twitter. When the hype doesn't live up to the reality and people cannot understand what is going on or how to use it, that would actually be *bad* for bitcoin because they would have effectively spread a lot of negative user experience. 
Bitcoin and LN is still too complicated for the average Twitter user. That's why Jack said they brought it to the platform too soon but that he believe's it will be back.
Lastly, they'd make a greater *contribution* by furthering their work providing access to the crypto landscape via Square and Cashapp.

The *one* person?!? You exaggerate the infuelence of a CEO, let alone any *one* person.
This is fine news and all, but Bitcoin doesn't need Jack Dorsey's approval. The tech will continue to develop and dominate if it is *deserved*, not because some guy says he likes it.
