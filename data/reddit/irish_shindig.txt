Unless you believe in anarchism, I can't see a system of government existing/having power if no one pays taxes...

I also would like to follow the path of philanthropic badassery, but I've been wondering over the last couple years - at what point someone should start being philanthropic?
Think about it - is there a set sum of money where, if I kept it, I would then be too greedy? What's the amount?
I'm a high school student - relatively poor - but I worked for the last two summers and I've found that I haven't spent ANY money on philanthropy. I've just kept looking for things that just barely extend my budget. Like I wanted a great automatic watch (~$8,000) but settled for a decent automatic watch (~$300), or some good headphones (~240), or the start of an stereo system (~$400). And with a couple thousand still in the bank, I'm wondering about getting a decent used car; a BMW Z3 perhaps, (~$5,000 on Craigslist).
None of these things are necessary, they were just nice to have. Am I greedy for buying them? Probably, yeah. (Offshoot thought - am I any happier for owning them? I don't know. I need to reflect more on that question.)
But I don't need a car (yet), I still live with my parents and drive their cars. And I didn't need an expensive watch, my old digital timex worked fine, my Apple IEM's worked well, and I didn't need a stereo system. Nonetheless, it's really hard to justify giving all that money away as a donation because "maybe I'll need it in the future."
I'm just saying, it's an important question to ask yourself. At what point do I start being philanthropic, and stop hoarding my money?
