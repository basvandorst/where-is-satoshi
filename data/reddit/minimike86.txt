Except it is true... at no point should you begin to trust the hackers just because they are holding your files hostage...
Morel of the story is DONT pay the ransom.
As said best thing to do is have a backup.
If you don't have a backup then you might get lucky and researchers could find the decryption key, there have even been times when the hackers have just got bored and released the private keys themselves.

FYI you should never pay a randomware ransom. More often than not the decryption key doesn't work and thats if you even receive one after payment.
You can use services like nomoreransom to decrypt the data yourself for free. These tools come about when information security researchers have reverse engineered the ransomware to find weaknesses in the attackers software.

I suggest everyone in the world send me their coins to see how many exist in circulation. I will of course return it at a later date... I promise...

Oh cool, to be fair to them anything raised is better than nothing! Do you know if they were only collecting crypto-coins and not fiat currencies as well?

QR codes are quite resistant to error, you could scribble out a couple squares and it would still work.
