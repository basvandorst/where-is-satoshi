Of course it is about sales tax too, all taxes count.
"Research reviewed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that between 50 percent and 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants pay federal, state, and local taxes."
If you want more just give them citizenship, problem solved.

No, right away.

Nonsense. There's no a priori reason to believe anything has changed.

You also need to trust 1) the competence of the devs, 2) the quality of your anti-malware software, 3) the continued forbearance of the financial regulators, and 4) other people's willingness to keep buying lots of bitcoins. It's not a store of value without all of these things.

It's easy to prove you have access to a wallet.

As a rule, if your news site disagrees with CBO, CBO is right.

You live, you learn. Illegal immigrants pay all kinds of taxes, including income tax. If the employer withholds the legally required amounts they can't even avoid it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:38:16


Of course they do.

True, but that won't help all those people who bought at ten times the price, believing there would be a money reserve from which they could safely get at least most of their investment back.

How about evidence that it is, first. Seems is not enough.

If the present does not matter, why look at bitcoin when you can look at all its technically more advanced competitors? Or actualmoney if you're a realist.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:57:02
Lots of back taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:26:34
Keep whining, that does not change facts. Most illegal immigrants pay taxes, including income tax.

You will the moment the mania ends and people start to ask themselves why should they pay real money for arbitrary internet tokens.

You don't get tax returns if you don't first pay taxes you dumbo. Also, nobody can avoid paying sales taxes.

Not if you renounce your citizenship, and look at how well that worked out for Roger Ver

Of course I'd be opposed to a non-progressive tax system, I'm an ethical person after all.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:52:33


No it's not.

You're almost correct. However, there's no pool to take money out of. It's already taken, all of it. For anyone to sell bitcoins for money, somebody else must be willing to buy them, essentially putting some money in the pool which the seller immediately takes. There is no buffer. If there are no more buyers, no more bitcoins can be sold and the price goes to zero.

Lol if true
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:16:47
Unless it's aimed at one of your "enemies" of course.

Stealing electricity, eh?
