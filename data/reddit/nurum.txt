So if someone were to go buy a decent computer and start "mining" is this something that could be actually profitable? Like if I took $5k and bought top of the line computers what kind of a "return" would one expect?

I am assuming the idea for bitcoins is that they will eventually be used as a normal form of currency. How does this work if they are worth $1k or likely much more. Can I buy something with .000001 bitcoins?


Technically the upkeep cost of maintaining bitcoin is nearly zero.
 
This is the part that confuses me, someone has to orchestrate this, you can't rely on volunteer labor forever to run something. Even wikipedia has paid people.

Could you make money using a bunch (say 100) average computers. This sounds like it is beyond my abilities, but my business partner is a tech person and we get a near unlimited supply of free home computers (ones people leave behind when they get foreclosed on). He usually takes what is worthwhile out of them before scrapping them. If he were to string up a ton of them would he get anywhere? Or would the power consumption alone eat away any of his profits?
As for me I think I would end up loosing my ass if I tried to throw money at this, I'll just stick to buying houses. At least those I understand.
