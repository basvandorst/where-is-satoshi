so effectively create inflation in Bitcoin? The entire selling point of Bitcoin is you can't make more. But you're really increasing supply if you just sub divide infinitely. No the better solution would be to use something like Litecoin on smaller transactions. A relationship like Gold and Silver.

I actually haven't even made an assertion. You've given no argument as to why its "reasonable" that LN routes would follow airline routes. 
How many regulations are there to setup a new hub in the airline industry?
How much capital does it take to setup a new hub in the airline industry? 
You see, the reason why there is no new hubs in the airline industry to fill a shortage is because IT'S NOT FEASIBLE.... Not to mention if you NEED the airport to be in the region of Atlanta it doesn't matter how many hubs or routes are around, you are limited to the physical geography and nature of airline routes. Now tell me, does LN occupy a physical space? No... your argument is completely irrelevant. Does LN require an exorbitant amount of capital? Is LN bogged down with regulation? The industries bare no relevance what so ever to each other.

LMFAO I can't stop laughing at this. Watch, in 2 months those same people will be asking how to buy Bitcoin.

Is anyone going to tell the Bitcoin Cash people that Dogecoin has more credibility than them? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:03:29
Thanks man
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:17:37
LN is the scalability solution for the problems we're facing NOW. You're asking us to solve a problem that doesn't exist yet, so why would there be a solution in existence? The only answer anyone can give is to hope that technology makes a leap forward when we need it.

"it's not merchants and commerce moving $billions. it's speculators. so how is bitcoin great again?" 
Are you trying to use that as an argument against Bitcoin specifically? Or an argument against crypto in general? Bitcoin still has the most use case out of any crypto currency (news flash, every single one of them is speculative right now) so I don't see what your point is. Or do you like being an idiot for no reason?

"Do you really think another hub can just pop up overnight"
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:04:13
" there are 3000+ other cryptocurrencies." So why wasn't Myspace as profitable as Facebook? Does it have something to do with the network? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:03:53
ok so you're talking about specifically from an exchange to cold storage. Do you have any data representing how many transactions take place for that one specific use case? How do you know the number of transactions taking place that are from an exchange to long term cold storage?
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:29:17
ya I had to take a minute to think about it. Makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:54:24
or answer the question?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:00:31
Just look at The exchanges , Gdax is usually leading in price. Wtf kind of data do you want? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:30:03
I think its more important that every day business adopt LN than exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:12:03

Is Bitcoin currently being used by 100% of the world? No it is not. Your analysis is meaningless because no one needs to solve a problem that doesn't exist yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:48:55
These statements always crack me up. Pretty much it comes down to no one knows anything, and everyone is full of shit trying to predict what BTC is going to do. Just because something was true in the past doesn't make it so now. Behaviors can change. 50% correction seems like capitulation to me. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:55:00
I get what you mean about "completely", maybe a bit too emphasized on my part. I think people also need to realize that LN is not the end game. The great thing about open source is anyone can contribute. If there is a better alternative then feel free to contribute. I'm sure something different to LN will come along and help satisfy the decentralization aspects that LN is missing. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:26:12
Legitimate enough to attract lots of capital. People trust the agencies still. I'll never say they're not full of shit, but it still brings a level of confidence for the masses. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:57:46
Seems like a positive thing to me to give legitimacy to the market. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:41:49
That's what I'm trying to say, just make another transaction. Is OP wanting to top off and avoid transaction fees?
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:07:35
Don't you just top it off by sending more BTC to your lightning address, just like if you wanted to send BTC to any other wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:44:30
ya I'm just wondering how long Bitcoin is going to be under pressure for. I'm not big into conspiracies but I find it hard to believe there's no correlation in this dip when the contracts expire tomorrow. So I'm curious if there's a specific time in the day we'll see a pop up in price.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:26:59
Don't think anyone cares about the fees right now. Otherwise it wouldn't have 1000x this last year...
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:15:25
I saw a point on another thread, maybe you can answer it. If Tether is inflating the price of Bitcoin then why doesn't Bitfinex lead the price? GDAX is usually the one leading Bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:07:46
no, silver is a better conductor
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:37:07
Because most people parroting "centralization" or "decentralization" can't even clearly define what it means. It's exactly like you've said, in what context?
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:24:16
I'll try answer your question. With LN Bitcoin doesn't have to be looked at as only a "store of value" because fees will be cheaper. Bitcoin can now perform more like a currency. Initially you will probably get a spike in transactions on the blockchain in order to open up LN channels, but once the channels are open they can perform many transactions off chain reducing the overall transactions that take place on chain. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:59:56
you said between exchanges AND people's cold storage. Probably far more volume between exchange transactions than exchange to cold storage. Still don't see your point. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:19:59

just get a paper wallet. Takes 20 seconds man
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:30:37
How does that work? Futures are cash settled right? Don't they just put a futures contract in and then short the hell out of it? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:34:02
besides up haha
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:55:15
"Nearly the whole current transaction load is between exchange" Why would an exchange not open a LN channel for their customers? Instead of a one person making repeated transactions on the block chain (from one exchange to the other) they can have a LN channel between the exchange and go back and forth as much as they want without clogging up the block chain. How would it not reduce load?
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:40:57
You're making the assumption that there will not be other nodes with enough funds to facilitate transactions, and then built your argument around that. Congratulations, you just employed a logical fallacy. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:45:46
Don't be a dolt. The problem we have right now is literally being resolved by a solution we have like right NOW (LN).
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:03:35
If you zoom in to other times when BTC was under a thousand you get the same picture. Give me any line or shape you want, I'll find somewhere in the charts it matches up. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:14:50
"Of course than the problem exist, that 100 MB mempool is there cause of what?"
I've already said the solution to this problem is LN. When a bigger problem comes (100% of the world?), another solution will surface. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:57:22


I've been told BCH can easily do the malleability fix to adopt LN. Although I'm kind of confused what the point of increasing the block size was in the first place if they just planned on adopting LN. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:42:14
Capitulation is panic selling, sharp decline, and high volume. What's more important is what comes after, the belief that anyone who wants to get out and sell has already done so. The price then rebounds and begins an upward move. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:28:51
volume usually indicates capitulation. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:24:53
That's a chicken and the egg thing though. What comes first, less volatility or more adoption? In other words, do we get less volatility because of increased adoption or do we get increased adoption because of less volatility? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:54:47
Think volume is the difference. Had really high volume yesterday and the day before compared to other days which had pretty low volume through out the correction. Usually indicates a bottom..... Usually 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:41:47
Sure if coinbase fails I could see that. Outside of that I don't think so.
