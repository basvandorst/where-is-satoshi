Willful idiocy is bad, give your head a good shake and see if it becomes untwisted. By the way leftist does not equal "statist", in fact at this point in history there are probably more rightist in the west who could reasonably be described as statist than leftists.  How the fuck old are you any way? Shouldn't you be in school?

Kudus to you for a brave and principled post. The reactionaries will react.

You guys are pathetic.

Hey look out! Was that a UFO?
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:02:56
No, distance and "relative stationaryness" are less important than the mass of the body and its gravity well. There are many asteroids that are less resource intensive to get onto and off of than the moon.

Why do you think Tesla won't be around in 10-20 years? 
If you care to wager some BTC on that I'll gladly take that bet. Maybe an Ethereum contract mmmm, what do you say?

Was probably first invented in Africa.
[From Wikipedia:](


Main article: Ferrous metallurgy
Where and how iron smelting was discovered is widely debated, and remains uncertain due to the significant lack of production finds. Nevertheless, there is some consensus[citation needed] that iron technology originated in the Near East, perhaps in Eastern Anatolia.
In Ancient Egypt, somewhere between the Third Intermediate Period and 23rd Dynasty (ca. 1100–750 BC), there are indications of iron working. Significantly though, no evidence for the smelting of iron from ore has been attested to Egypt in any (pre-modern) period. There is a further possibility of iron smelting and working in West Africa by 1200 BC.[5] In addition, very early instances of carbon steel were found to be in production around 2000 years before the present in northwest Tanzania, based on complex preheating principles. These discoveries are significant for the history of metallurgy.[6]
Most early processes in Europe and Africa involved smelting iron ore in a bloomery, where the temperature is kept low enough so that the iron does not melt. This produces a spongy mass of iron called a bloom, which then has to be consolidated with a hammer. The earliest evidence to date for the bloomery smelting of iron is found at Tell Hammeh, Jordan (see also external link), and dates to 930 BC (C14 dating).

Fuck you and your probably racially motivated disparagement of Africa and by extension the people who live there. You sir are a shitty person.

I'm not sure the words mean what you say they do.


action by a group, army, etc., that is done to overthrow a government that is in power because of an earlier revolution.

You are right this is the biggest issue facing Bitcoin. If you can pull this off there is a lot of money to be made.

Federal Reserve has a part in the creation of Fiat Money.  Banks are the faucets and collectors of Debt Money.

Thanks man.

Lanier is not advocating a retreat to the caves. What the dread is advocating in this interview is a complete rethink of what we recognize and compensate as valuable. What he is saying is that exponential technologies will create mass unemployment given how our economies and our value system is currently organized. 
Unless people are compensated for doing creative work and interacting with others (thereby adding value to lives of others) we are going to have a bad time. 
Under our current economic model the centralization of wealth is increasing exponentially. This is an existential treat to human civilization, if there is not a reversal there will be rivers of blood in the streets when people can't feed their children because they have no income. 
Programmable money that can be used to compensate people for a much wider range of  activities that enrich human lives will be one of the vehicles that will transport us to a much brighter, pleasure filled world.

Yeah you say that now but let someone post something that offends your sense of self and you'll be whining about reverse racism of some such.

This is actually good news!
No really, after the media shit storm has washed away and bitcoin regathered strength moving back above 800, a bunch of people sitting on the side are going to say "You know what?..." These new adopters are going to carry us up over 1200. Then its off to da proverbial moon.
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:13:10
good luck with that.

Good on you Gavin, we appreciate the work you are doing. I wish some in the media would work as hard at maintaining their supossed ethical standards.
