Probably [Overstock]( They also keep a % of the Bitcoin, and don't change it all immediately to FIAT.

Ok nice straw man, I don't think Bitcoin is Jesus.  Maybe you love government so much that you have a twisted view of the way the world works.  Our founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson was a classical liberal, or a libertarian.  Milton Friedman was a libertarian.  Adam Smith was a libertarian.  Libertarian ideas are what created America Land of the Free, the most prosperous nation on Earth.  Its only recently since the inception of the Fed in 1913 that things got bad.  This country fought central banks all throughout history.  Even Andrew Jackson's last words were "I killed the bank". Yet central banks are one of the main tenets of the communist manifestor. If you hate libertarianism, maybe its because you have cognitive dissonance because you have a public sector job sucking the tax money off the rest of us producers like parasites.

We could see a price rebound if things get back to normal soon.
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:59:31
Oh that's good then.  It only looked low because the previous high was so high.

These people are so disgusting, they make me want to throw up.  They are criminals.
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:54:54
Thats the way its spelled FIAT.  Get with the notation retard.

I'm glad airbitz is committed to the core values of bitcoin, meaning decentralization and privacy.

Funny how the anti-bitcoin people, are always anti-libertarian, as shown by your posts.  If you hate Bitcoin, why are you even here?
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:55:14
You mean its fun to be a pathetic troll in your mom's basement?
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:18:53
This is not really relevant here.  I don't see many people leaving Bitcoins on their curb.  Even buttcoiners who hate bitcoin, will take it and sell it for FIAT.
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:42:52
Nah, I'm just old school like that ;)
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:32:41
Ohh I heard they accept Bitcoin internationally now: 
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:58:51
Do you have anything better to do than troll people?  He didn't bad mouth the country, he bad mouthed the tyranny that has taken over this country.  The real America that the Founding Fathers created was based on libertarian ideas, and it created the most free prosperous nation on Earth.  Its only recently the country lost the fight against central banks in 1913.  Its only recently that our constitution has been destroyed more and more.  Maybe you are the real enemy of America, since you just keep your mouth shut about all the crap going on, like a coward.

Nice work!

People give away many things of value as gifts, but they dont throw it in the trash.
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:56:23
So you just like to annoy people and ridicule them and harrass them and troll them? Nice.
