Nah, I never bought in.
There's no world where I wouldn't have lost all my Bitcoins just from sheer incompetence on my own part.
That's why I like banks: I am literally an idiot, and 'being my own bank' is a petrifying idea.

May 11th reporting in: It's $8600.

Not quite, honestly. I'd have probably put my money into Mt. Gox like everyone told me to, and lost all my Bitcoins.
Or lost track of my 25-word wallet somewhere along the times I've had to move houses.
Or maybe mistyped a single letter in an address and irrevocably sent money to the wrong place.
Heck, I've lost my actual wallet TWICE. If I wasn't able to just, y'know, call my bank and get things reversed, I'd be done for.
I really, honestly hope Bitcoin doesn't take off mainstream, because I'm not even the dumbest person.

That's cool. Personally I am gonna look back and regret lost travel opportunities, not lost productivity opportunities. I'm glad your system works for you, though.

Question: How is he not successful at life when he's doing things he enjoys doing? How are you measuring success?

It's valuable to them, but I don't have a better place to sell it.
@_date: 2019-04-27 17:49:39
They do. Have done it.
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:44:57
But you need miners to deliver it for you literally every single time. 
Said miners can effectively lock you out just via blacklisting, if the major cartels so chose.

Smart investors like Draper are still insisting Bitcoin will be 20k by year end. They are looking for bagholders. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:47:24
7 tps max is well designed? 
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:38:14
So it's not going to happen. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:56:53
Valve did. Then they bailed. 
Microsoft did. Then they bailed. 
How major do you need here? 
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:55:18
Oh no. I am not even remotely JUST'd. I have seen far worse. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:20:01
Ooh, sorry about that.
 says 1.47 right now. 
 says 8000 unconfirmed transactions right now.
Gonna go with 'it doesn't work like that', chief.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:40:59
Let's say your singularity happens against all logic and reason. I now get paid in Bitcoin. What does it matter? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:28:43
Hey, friend, how's your dick doing?
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:16:25
Then capital flight to China is not going to help you. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:21:54
Right? I pretty much would have just lost my 25-word password somewhere along the line. There's no world where the average person could hope to hold crypto and not lose it to some derp somewhere.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:33:47
Well, er, do you think they won't assume you have some good wallets somewhere with your lambo sticking out?
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:20:05
waiting on upward trend please advise
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:16:26
Eh, fivethirtyeight's the only reliable pollster, and he gave Trump 30%. Which, y'know, isn't bad.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:55:51
I had a 0.25 btc wallet in 2010 for like two hours before I deleted it. I would be salty but there is no world where I would not have lost it all on mt gox. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:59:58
Trick that way is I can't possibly end up a bagholder.
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:28:42
It's just trading the tyranny of banks and government for the tyranny of whatever mining pool and code devs own your coin. Nothing has changed.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:29:46
Well...it increased for quite a while, sure...
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:41:46
Well, the major spike came from your average person suddenly hearing about Bitcoin.
The searches for Bitcoin have dropped. The mass media influenza about Bitcoin has stalled. The stories are now about the scams in the Bitcoin world.
That's the real problem you guys are facing. When the momentum came, Bitcoin wasn't a shining star of 'move your money fast and easy to your family and friends, make Paypal look like a joke', it was a shining star of 'make fast cash right now'.
Noone outside of cryptospace talks about Bitcoin as a currency. They talk about how it may or may not make you rich someday. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:02:15
Nah. See, what I'll do is I'll just work for it. I'll perform tasks and labour that have value to others, and then receive Bitcoin for it.
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:37:40
Let's say you bought off Amazon. How do they know where to send your package? 
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:41:40
Nah. If I had bought in at like sixty cents or whatever when I first heard about it.... 
I'd have lost everything in Mt. Gox like everyone else did.
Every Bitcoin millionaire got there on the backs of bagholders. No-one produced anything of value. 
No-one has given me a viable reason to use Bitcoin that doesn't require a near pathological fear of society, or worse, libertarianism. 
Being constantly told how your fake Internet money will destroy the banks, man, for real, gets grating. 
Block chains are just merkle trees with shiny paint. Seen lots of companies talk about using it, haven't seen anyone using it where not using it wouldn't be more efficient. 
I have friends who could have sold at 20k and gotten out of debt. It's you guys who went 'no no hodl hold moon moon lambo' and stopped them.. Even if someone believes in your coin, selling at 20 and buying at 7 would have still worked.
That's why I hate crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:34:07
Blockchain doesn't really solve personal privacy issues. Like, in any way, shape, or form. 
Companies still need people's addresses and date of birth for their records. That either goes on the blockchain or does not. If it does, then it's decryptable. If it does not, blockchain does nothing.
Merkle trees aren't actually new tech.

Good luck. I have a po box and half the things I order, Amazon tells me that the manufacturer refuses to ship to Amazon Pickup points let alone my PO box. 
Furthermore, if I was that chuffed, I would just use a prepaid VISA. Same result, without all the hassle of Bitcoin.

Hornswoggled again! 
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:27:33
Sure. Many people got rich off Bitcoin. Every last one of them got rich off some other guy who /thinks/ they're going to get rich, but is instead the bagholder. 
So, this guy who's bought property and land and all that. How's he gonna pay his property taxes, anyway? Unless he can turn that Bitcoin into income, reliable income, he's just gonna get chipped away to nothing like a lottery winner.
Anyway, Bitcoin's rise is absolutely not an accident. A bunch of people made money off other people desperate to make money.
For every, uh, 'success' story like this guy, who's stuck using Bitcoin forever, there's a ton of people who've lost everything. I'm not impressed.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:34:25
I'm not sure you saw the end of that graph.
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:43:16
My coworkers were not discussing Bitcoin in 2013 and 2014.
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:15:03
Yeah. That was oil dependency. Fake internet money would not have fixed that. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:43:52
The internet also lacked critical physical infrastructure for mainstream adoption.
Crypto doesn't have that problem.
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:11:24
I was worried you weren't larping. Then this happened.
