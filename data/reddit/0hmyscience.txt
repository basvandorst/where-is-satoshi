It's an impression of Bernie though, not actual Bernie. It's just a funny post, you're not missing anything.

Computer Science question here... From what I understand, a blockchain is a special kind of linked list. Is there an efficient way of searching through a blockchain? Or is it all O(n)? Because this would probably be a big fucking n.

This sounds like a sound comment made by a well informed person.
@_date: 2016-03-11 04:45:52
This makes perfect sense. Thanks.

pardon my ignorance, but what is a tx fee, and isn't bitcoin supposed to be free?
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:26:29
What is/was Circle?

When anyone reads comments like this one, it is important to realize the difference between "It is an edited video where [...]" and "**In my opinion**, it is an edited video where [...]". Because that is what this comment is... an opinion.

This might seem like a stupid question... but if the reason some people use bitcoin is to remain anonymous, how do you get around this? Would you have to dodge taxes to stay anonymous (which means you're legally required to "expose" yourself) or is there a way around this?

You couldn't use it! That would be against the EULA!

I notice the warning is posted on this subreddit. Do we know anything about the "virus" that is contained in the file? Is it's purpose to try and steal bitcoin data? Why would they target this subreddit?

Macbook Pro, Chrome, looks good.
Macbook Pro, Terminal (curl), looks good.
@_date: 2015-03-04 22:36:27
Yup. Glancing at it, it's a trojan, has the capability to install other malware, and it's described by a couple as "Coin Stealer". So it is most likely targeting Bitcoin users. 
Thanks for the link!

It makes me a bit uneasy that qbittorent doesn't use HTTPS to let you download the file. They provide the SHA1/MD5 but it's pointless since that's also transferred without HTTPS. 
Anyone interested in fucking with people who download using torrents would have a field day today since I'm sure a lot of people will be downloading uTorrent alternatives.

So once that or those addresses spend the money and eventually "cash out", or buy something that requires a physical address, won't they be caught?

Thanks for the explanation. I see what you're saying with "fungible". I'm trying to fully understand the whole "anonymity" aspect of btc, so I have a follow up question.
If I rob a bank, and then one of the dollar bills end up in your pocket then you're innocent. However, if we could know the exact path that bill took since it's robbery to you, then we could learn some things. For example, maybe you got that dollar bill as change from Starbucks, and Starbucks got it when John Doe bought coffee, and John Doe got it when he sold his laptop on Craigslist from the person who owned the dollar bill after the bank did (i.e. me, the robber). Then we know that if we can trace that laptop, we can potentially track the robber. BTC makes this incredibly easy to do. So what's stopping anyone from trying to investigate what was bought with the stolen BTCs and figuring out who was the one who benefited from the transactions that were part of the "heist"?
My point is that at some point, the BTC must be converted to a good or to cash, and at that point, the user exposes himself to having his public key matched to a real object or even a real person. What has stopped this from happening with 450 million dollars?

Anyone have links to the rest of the lectures?

At 0h55m, he states that the coins must not have been combined. How can this be checked? And how can the same thing that could be done with Goofy coin be prevented (i.e. point to a block in the block chain where the coin hasn't been consumed yet)?
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:43:36
Just watched the whole thing. I'm a bitcoin noob, and I'm wondering if someone can explain how those bitcoin disappeared last February? Wouldn't the blockchain show where they went?
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:38:50
Awesome thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:00:14
I'd buy Amazon for 1000 USD
@_date: 2016-07-16 20:12:51
you ok?

wow, this anonymous guy is such a great hacker and also a professional quote maker!
