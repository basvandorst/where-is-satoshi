Password fault, as in the "seed" password?

Getting a loan on speculative investing is VERY high-risk. A quantitative gain with infinitive risk.
Sounds like you should focus on personal finance, then move to investing.

You could be right- I appreciate the opinions!

I'm not too sure about that. Herd mentality or the "animal spirits" would influence this situation heavily.

I'm not a fan of fear tactics in advertising... spooks outsiders, and can be seen as a "fringe" movement. I like the idea, though!

I like Megatoshi :)

Yeah, not sure. Bitcoin is still in its infancy. But if I were to express an opinion, I think I will disagree with your hypothesis. I view BTC as an "equity" of technology. This idea can paralleled with our stock exchange with fiat currency in Wall Street. If this holds true, than, like the stock market,  BTC would need to rely on investment. This is also known as capital (expressed as k in Economics).  
There is also a direct correlation relative to USD &amp; BTC (it's hard to find a job the pays direct deposit in BTC). We need USD to convert to BTC.* 
In relation to the above,  a downturn in the economy in the U.S. would most likely dry up the investment pool and retract the value of BTC. 
*Some may argue this point as there are ways to earn BTC without fiat currency, such as mining pools, hash power, etc. I believe that large institutional investors, e.g., Whales,  play a major role in BTC. Even with hash power, these Whales have a large affect on bitcoin.

Very Keynesian! Herd mentality should be considered at all times. Nice point.

If you're a long-term investor, there are no dips. Only growth. Buy when you can or you may miss the train ;)

I see your point. I haven't given too much thought to this, but it would be interesting to see (hopefully in a simulated setting). Just like the complexities of macro/micro economics, there are a huge amount of variables to consider under this relationship.

Historically speaking, talk about how BTC would potentially be the first time that PEOPLE will own their currency and not their government!
