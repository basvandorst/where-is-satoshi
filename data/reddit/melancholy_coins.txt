A bunch of people arguing over who’s payment system is better.  A decrepit BTC that needs a second layer solution to even function or a similar payment network (BCH) with still no smart contacts and nothing particularly special about it still.  Seriously.  If the only thing either can do is transfer value (the most basic thing a crypto currency can do at this point), who cares?  Pick one or pick none. But don’t go around arguing who’s dial up is the fastest.

Yup. I personally believe that he lighting network will do alright. But there are so many other payment options available at this point.  They’re simpler and faster and not to mention they are in use now.  Some of my favorite are LTC &amp; XLM.  BTC Is going to become digital gold for half of its users. At least that’s how I’m treating mine. I hold 0 BCH.

I HODL because I’m in it for the long term.

This is gold.

Agreed.

Shit like this makes me wonder who all we deal with in this community.  If we are using bitcoin and to change the world or even just to make some cash, that’s great but this cliquey us vs them mentality is a joke.  Let them do their thing and we do ours.  There are some people who hold both or neither. Like this shit right here is what you’d see in some neck beard atheist MLP subreddit. I know that’s a stretch but what I’m saying is that only (man)children attack each other with memes. Hold or trade or contribute but don’t waste your energy keeping up and making fun of some community or idea just because you don’t believe in it. That’s what does.
