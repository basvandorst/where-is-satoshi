Being from a desert region it always bugged me how everyone thought having a gigantic green lawn was necessary. You can do landscaping with cacti and other drought tolerant plants. 
Anyways, you sound like a level-headed dude and I wish you luck on your campaign.

You sound incredibly ignorant right now.

There isn't even a democrat running in your district? Good luck man. Even if you don't win you're bringing more attention to our party.

While I think he could have explained it better, the answer to any issue to a libertarian is to take the government out of the equation. 
Ex: Gay marriage. Libertarians believe that the government shouldn't even control marriage and that it should be between the people and their church. 
It's not a difficult concept I promise.

I imagine with 2 and 3 you would be able to see the time and date of claims. This would allow you to see who was the first person to claim the art.

Forum software by default logs IPs. It stops people for creating multiple accounts and helps with a slew of other things. If you don't want your IP logged, then get a VPN.

If I were to be tried of a crime, I would have fought it as much as I possibly could. I wasn't buying illegal drugs, I was buying a medication from someone that I wanted to, rather than who the FDA forces you to buy from. I don't think would have gotten convicted of anything. And even if I did, I wouldn't feel guilty about it whatsoever. 
I wasn't afraid of being ripped off because this guy had a lot of great reviews. That's the beauty of the darknet vs. clearnet for buying medications.

There was RockApp, which was headed in the right direction. Guess who bought them out and never implemented one of the features?

We have NOT went under. Our company and bitcoin shares remain profitable.

Surely he's joking.

What would you do, if elected, to break up these monopolies?

But you can only buy ribs and hot dogs with BBQCoin.

Yes like he has time to write an essay for every question on this page.

My point is that those 1000s of variations are all taken.

This is bigger news than it seems. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 03:13:32
Thanks for the insight. I'll be selling all my bitcoin and putting all my money into blockbuster stock. I'm glad we have people like you to give this top-notch financial advice.

B!old tests and checkups not included. That's adding about another $250 a month for those. I was only doing a low dose so blood tests weren't necessary.

It's a little late now. Already sold all my bitcoin.

I used the darknet to get my acne medicine. Costs $60 for a half course of accutane versus about $1200 if I went to the pharmacy. 
The medicine was indeed legit and dried my skin right up. I am now (almost) completely clear. If it wasn't for the darnknet, I would have never been able to afford it.

People "invest" in gold as well. I spend almost all of my bitcoins (with the Coinbase app it makes my credit card seem like an antique) but I don't think there's anything wrong with "innvesting"  in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:11:21
You're right, the other 2 parties think "MORE GUBMENT"  is the solution to everything. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:25:34
What about backdoors?

I called the top when it hit $12. 
That was not a good day.

Both domains you mentioned are taken.

This is insane. I'm glad I live in the land of the free.

Cash is still better for criminals. We can see where that bitcoin was transferred to. With cash it's just not that easy.

American here. 
When someone says "could care less" that means you have to have some amount of care. It makes no sense. 
I'm going to go look this up on my digital dictionary I bought off line.

This is what I want to see! Bring it on Comcast!

Sure, barely any physical retailers take Bitcoin. But there are a lot of places online that accept it.

I swear I've seen these exact same posts a year ago.
