Yes. Theoretically if you bought BTC with USD then sold your BTC for USD each transaction is subject to a gain/loss.

That particular conversation is about transactions made that are more than $20k in 2013-2015. From that specific language it tells me that *all* transactions from 2016 on are to be reported.
In other words... if you've done *anything* since 2016 you had better report.

"Bitcoin is about to be available to all retail investors via fidelity/coinbase"
Might you have a link for this? I'd really like to know more.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:14:24
Anything you pull out is subject to the before and after price. If you buy 10, it goes to 100, and you sell 1 that 1 is subject to the difference between the buy price and the sell price.
The only variable is that if you keep for less than one year it is subject to the "ordinary income tax rate" versus if you kept for more than a year it is only subject to "capital gains (15% USA)". Also, if you buy a crypto on day 1, sell for a loss on day 5, and then re-buy on day 6 you cannot claim the loss. There is a 30 day wait period.

You wouldn't.
This is important for those that have 401k's. You can't buy Bitcoin in your retirement account and neither can hedge funds. There are *billions* of dollars on the sideline waiting for an opportunity. 
Need proof? Look at the ridiculously expensive GBTC and it's meteoric climb over the last 4 months.

52 year old here-just this morning I had my "that's it..." moment. I'm never explaining this shit again ever. Exhausting. My fellow old guys are barely able to send an email let alone buy some BTC and download a wallet.

If miners ditch BTC for Bitcoin Cash then I would think that BTC's price is going down and thus taking GBTC with it. Any opinions on that?
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:35:52

@_date: 2017-08-13 03:15:40
Come to think of it they're more like 55-57 I think but it's pretty pathetic.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:14:43
It's peculiar. I mean, there's interest because of the significant gain in worth and how the the block chain is applicable in so many areas of life but then it immediately goes to "eye-roll" when I discuss the particulars on how to do it- first you go to this site, send your money, download a wallet, etc... seems to be a quantum leap for anyone over 45. The *process* is still incredibly difficult for the average joe. The idea of not having account numbers at Coinbase always raises eyebrows.
Age is a barrier but the process is bigger barrier for most. I was talking to a 25 year-old guy last night who I can I lost after "once you've purchased your BTC on Coinbase you have the choice of either creating a paper wallet or a hardware wallet such as Trezor..." I try to explain at this moment that there will be a learning curve, an "ah-hah" moment where everything will become crystal clear and to start small, never risk anything that could negatively alter your life etc... I explain while there is a bigger universe of alternative coins to explore it is perfectly reasonable to stop at simply buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:15:13
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:11:02
What happens now to the BTC? Does it simply float off never to be seen again?

Yes. GBTC is supposed to work as a percentage of actual BTC price but it has blown past that trading at a huge premium.
GBTC is definitely not one to bury in the 401k and forget about it. The swings are wild. I've been in and out of it several times a month. Until another instrument comes along and of course believing in Bitcoins long term prospects, GBTC is a no brainer-in a 401k/SEP of course. There is no need to buy outside of a retirement account.

To the average joe/joette Bitcoin is INSANELY hard to buy. I can hear it now at the HBO boardroom: "So wait...we're supposed to send a 1/4 million dollars to this 'Coinbase' website and not be handed an account number or any documentation whatsoever, wait a week for the cash to clear, then buy our Bitcoin and then we send it to a digital wallet..."
At least the thieves are smart. It's not like they said: you have *24 hours* to deliver $250k worth of BTC..."
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:53:44
HA! Reasonable connection.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:42:54

A 401k isn't an emergency fund. There are taxes and penalties for early withdrawal.

@_date: 2017-11-21 12:56:12
FIFO - First in first out. Short term is under a year and the rate is your personal income tax rate based on how much you make and over a year it counts as capital gain/loss. Further, you can't count any losses that you held under a month ("wash" rule). For example you can't buy BCC for $2k sell the next day at $1,500 because it dipped and then buy back again within 30 days thinking you're going to lock in that loss for tax purposes. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:50:17
It's treated like a stock. Your buys/sells are all listed on a .csv file that you can export from whatever exchange(s) you're using. You can import that .csv file into a tax program and it will tell you. You're taxed on every single transaction although I think now it's only transactions over $600 (need clarification). It's not up to the IRS to determine how much you made/loss, it's up to you.

I sold awhile back but I don't think they're doing a distribution. I could be totally wrong but I thought I saw originally some *very* unspecific language from them about distribution and then an announcement that they were setting up another fund. In Grayscale's defence, they may not legally be able to distribute based on how their charter is written.
I didn't like the language or the uncertainty and pulled the little amount I had.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:53:11

@_date: 2017-11-05 11:18:59
I'm reading this a lot. This question about "why not buy BTC..." completely negates that you simply CAN'T do it within many/most existing IRA's. For example, should you have a retirement account at Fidelity you can't simply buy Bitcoin however you can buy GBTC. GBTC for all of its pitfalls (price, fee, odd premium to BTC and sometimes traveling down while BTC goes up, etc...) is a BEAUTIFUL way to be exposed to BTC alongside your AMZN, AAPL, etc...
Beautiful until a real ETF comes along and then hold onto your shorts the GBTC premium will plummet and it might actually track to BTC more accurately.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:46:54


I think there's no appetite for going to jail.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:45:34
Ok, I'll just open up my roth here on Fidelity and buy me some BTC, oh wait, you can't. Oh right, I can buy GBTC instead.
Over the past year I've more and more people come around to Bitcoin and crypto. We're old, 50 plus. Do you know what the biggest complaint is from these noobs? No statements. They want to see what they own on a statement. On paper no less.

@_date: 2017-11-04 04:22:51
Interesting. I assumed it was all of it but it's not:
"Age 59 and under. You can withdraw contributions you made to your Roth IRA anytime, tax- and penalty-free. However, you may have to pay taxes and penalties on earnings in your Roth IRA. Withdrawals from a Roth IRA you've had less than five years."
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:38:44
Actually...paying your crypto tax is simple. It's treated like a stock so you list your gain/loss on your form (schedule D?) and pay depending on the amount of time you held it. More than a year and it's "only" 15%
"Ignorance" is never a defence. Coinbase already provides "tax forms" as do most (all) other exchanges. You can export a .csv file into a tax program and it will figure out your gain/loss.
Then again you could not pay. The problem with that is when you roll into your local Lambo dealer 10 years from now (there will be a Lamborghini dealership on every corner in 2025) and plunk down your converted to fiat cash or even pay with Bitcoin if that's possible the sale itself will trigger an audit. Better to take care of the taxes now.
At this very moment, completely unrelated to anything crypto, if you were to roll into a car dealership or buy a house the transaction is flagged and the IRS is notified. If there isn't a clear line to the origination of the funds then it's likely triggering an audit. This is why governments are going to want a level of transparency with crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:21:59

He could still have it in his Roth just by selling an existing position or existing cash and just buy some. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:14:36
With all due respect Trevon...BULLSHIT! I can't believe he's risking jail time and imploading his channel because of taxes. He could just hold his coins, steer clear of Bitconnect, pay his god damned taxes, and just legitimately fucking coast into being rich. There's no way the IRS is going to buy this story.
He wants his name away from Bitconnect to be sure. When Bitcoinconnect goes down it's going to be a major bruise in the Bitcoin brand and his name is going to be plastered on the side of that. Same thing with Craig.
Very disappointed in both those gentlemen.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:40:19
Because your dad wants to own it in his Fidelity account with his 401K and you simply cannot buy BTC there.  Plus, for the average dude/dudette setting up a wallet and private keys, etc... is rocket science. GBTC can be bought in a nice familiar way and show up on a monthly statement.
How possibly can the allure of GBTC not be *more* obvious than simply owning it outright? I have both BTW and will say I'm grateful GBTC exists because it's virtually carrying my entire portfolio.

GBTC is to purchase within your 401k or SEP program. If you don't have that then just invest in BTC directly. You cannot buy Bitcoin within established retirement accounts which is why GBTC is a good option. Currently GBTC is essentially the only game in town.

I just spent the weekend with a bunch of buddies I've had since high school and they watched me babble on about all things crypto. I think they thought I either drank too much or suffering from dementia. One of them actually admitted to having bought some Bitcoin upon getting a recommendation from a work associate. I became excited and asked when he got it/how much/ etc... He did tell me that he bought a significant amount whatever that means and that he bought in 2015. After I congratulated him and then he told me he "owns it in an email and he needs to locate that email to see how much he has". Ugh.

Excellent exposure to BTC within a 401K or other investment account. Not good outside anything other than retirement accounts. Trades at roughly 13-15% prior to 91-1 split they just had regardless of what is stated.
Plenty will whine about fees but it’s performance has been stellar. This year for example, BTC is supposed to wind up at $40-50k? Think of what that will do for GBTC if it’s in your retirement account.

If we’re doing cringy Bitcoin tattoos maybe just the logo and public address.

YAAAAAAHHHH! That was awesome.

Wouldn't be surprised if the prince was merely campaigning to see if his comments would leave a water mark like Jamie Dimon's while simultaneously purchasing as much as he can get his hands on. And while he's probably not waiting around on Coinbase trying to get his funds verified I'm sure he's pissedmthat he can't simply snap his fingers and buy $500 million worth.

Nice lady. You are lucky.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:30:42
2018 is going to be insanely exciting.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:40:05
Whoa that’s a lot. Love to hear a simple explanation.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:19:34
Hey big spender...want some company?
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:54:28
Give it a few days...
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:50:23
Good point. Sell everything. Computers never caught on.

Speaking as a 50 year old... WITHOUT QUESTION the red pill. My god people the aging process just sucks. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:58:55
Seems reasonable.

They know it's only a matter of time before one of the ETF's is accepted and they'll lose their shorts if they can't compete. They're doing everything they can to appear as a "stable" fund.

Too soon. Hodl. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:57:35
It’s expensive as a fund but easy to buy, hold, and if you believe in bitcoin just hodl. I bought it at 143 in the spring I think and it’s easily the best performing “stock” I own. It’s at about 700 right now. It’s a no brainer.

It's a filter. It's an instant way for the listener/reader to know that people referring to a "bubble" are stuck in 1998 analogous internet company theory and viewing the blockchain industry on the whole as a merky fishbowl of ideas they don't understand or possibly comprehend.
It's really a quick way of saying: "I don't get it so it must be bad"

Cymbal crash!
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:36:12
Yup, I'd say beginning early majority but I think the scale of that mountain is bigger. I think 2018 is going to be yuge.  
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:02:52
*That* is not my idea of fun. Would give it to him give or take $100k.

“Personally, I can’t wait to watch some documentary five years from now on how rampant the manipulation really was in the early days of crypto. The stories will make for some great television.”
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:22:34
Definitely more than 100 times over the course of just over a year and I've never seen it this fast. Sorry, not a technical person just observing and have been suffering very slow transfers since May and suddenly it's screaming. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:41:12
Exactly. Spot on.

I see a BTC sell off merely reflecting herd jubilation of getting back into cryptos. If Bitcoin craters the lowest it will go is 2000 and then start it's most historic climb ever starting around 8/7-8/8.
We will see 4,000+ BTC by the end of the year.
