if theres anything i've learned working in finance and psychology for a while now, and its something i wish wasnt true (and still hope there is some great hidden conspiracy that its all a facade), people who are 'experts' about politics and economics are wrong just as much as anyone else, except with the added danger of their phd or position to add weight to their 'expert' opinion

its not though
if we had the option of (we learn nothing at all for the next year) OR (we learn to eat human shit and molest children for the next year), you can objectively say no learning is better than learning the wrong things

a big true value of crypto that is currently unrealized is the way for websites and content creators to make money by using crypto instead of ads to generate income
[piratebay tried it for a while]( and maybe still do, an option where instead of ads on screen you would mine a coin for a certain period of time. that way you get to use a better site without ads and they make money. they did it in a bad implementation because they were mining on cpu's throttling them to 100% which worsened the user experience, but done properly i think people would be more OK with this and giving money directly to the person/site they are watching rather than seeing annoying ads (and many users using adblock for that reason)
imagine if pewdiepie and zerohedge, instead of running ads, linked to a website with their acct  and an extension button on the content creators actual site, allowing you to click and generate them a few cents of cryptocoin
you dont have to worry about demonitization, questionable content for advertisers, whatever. its money directly from you to the person without having to worsen your content viewing experience, in a way that's never been possible before
i think when this catches on, it will make a big difference

i mean you could easily use the same logic as OP and say '$1,000,000 bitcoin will just be another tiny blip'

yes if it was more popular. there were big legal problems for people who tried cornering the silver market in the 80s
