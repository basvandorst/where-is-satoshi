Ive held and bought in small increments for 4 years. Never sold for fiat which has made its way off of an exchange. Recently ive thought alot about getting my initial investment back or profiting. However, although my avg buy isnt zero technically it feels like it is because i never cared to see that money again
Its a battle now with my wife. I knew these days would always come but i never envisioned how it would go down. How it would go to $10, $20 and $50k. I want to sell my btc, not for fiat but when its requested in itself

Honestly, I gave my cousin .05 BTC on a paper wallet for graduating HS 4 years ago. He wanted to sell it. This was me walking him through how to do it. I think its bonehead thing to sell it anyways. The 14 days is what it is. 
If it gets cancelled will that show up on the blockchain as such? So that I know we can try again if need be?

I actaully was able to pull off a double spend. He gave me the private key and i swept it with a larger fee. All is good

I gave my cousin .05 BTC jan 2014. He contacted me last week to cash out. It was on a paper wallet. I talked him through sweeping it onto Bread (easy way) and its been unconfirmed for 10 days. To get him off my back i sent him .05 so he can cash out.
Right now his $40 gift has costed me .15 BTC because i cant get the transaction confirmed which he would send to me. 
Worst thing i ever did. And im someone who has never sold ever

Yes. That is accurate. Selling on the coinbase app charges a premium (same with purchasing)

I have a transaction unconfirmed for 4 days. I swept a paper wallet with Bread (who doesnt let you determine fee so its 50 sat/byte) I didnt need it to confirm right away but 4 days is alot. 
Any suggestions as to when this may get cancelled?

What i meant is... i gave .05 BTC gift, which costed me $40 at the time. He wanted to sell and and i walked him through it but it went it unconfirmed. So i sent him .05 again to get him off my back (so in hindsight a $40 gift has turned into .1 BTC of mine floating out there) 
I got the .05 back so its cool but its a lesson to just let people learn this on their own.
I had christmas with him yeaterday and it was awkward. I gave him a gift that appreciated 20x and he was all about how it was a bubble and going to crash. While i, never having sold anything ever

This is starting to be an issue for new comers for sure. Gdax for example still has minimum trades of .01 BTC. Thats $45 now when it was $2.50 a couple years ago. Listing in mBTC so people can read the decimals better is next step

I spent 4 BTC on overstock buying pillows, a car seat, toys, headphones etc. i still have the pillows they are comfortable

I got a little nervous until he mentioned the US shutting down online poker sites

Just pulled a batched transation to approx 200 outputs. Total fee paid $7.87
Batching can have a much greater immediate impact. Even if XYZ exchange pools withdrawls every 30 min or hour (or if they have data to show their busiest times of withdrawls) batch those for very economical cost. 
In december i had a 50 sat fee transaction sit for weeks. An hour with batching and very cheap fees would be fine with me
