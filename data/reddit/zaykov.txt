People must be getting more stupid over time. What is the point to buy account, especially verified account where the original owner sent ID? The new owner will load it with coins and the old one will prove it’s his and steal legally the coins...
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:53:14
Good luck with some dummy actually buying your account... 
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:41:23
GDAX withdrawing fees are ZERO, I don’t know how you manage to get charged by GDAX..?!?! 
Other than that, $8 fees are actually cheap. Sometimes I need to deal with $80-90 USD transaction costs. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:13:03
The price will likely go down, but what is your point of asking? If everyone suddenly stop buying Apple products and Apple bubble will pop... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:31:26
Probably will not, governments loves money, they will just start taxing BTC and carry on 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:50:15
If bitcoin reach zero, they will give it away, so you don’t have to buy it :) 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:30:01
I’ve never use it, so I cannot vouch for it. Check out later what is private keys, it might help you to clear the things out for you 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:20:30
Use whatever wallet you have, but it’s the best to use wallet which you know the private key in case something goes bad and they close the sites you host your BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:04:48
No begging allowed

$20k till Sunday 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:42:47
Idk than, it might be overloaded at the moment, today I waited 45 min for transaction to be sent from gdax, just too much trading and transactions today 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:22:30
Go in Gdax Accounts tab, choose BTC and you have three options - History, Holds, Withdraws, choose the last and track your withdraws from there. It will show you if it’s pending and when it’s expected to execute 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:53:06
In the worst case scenario the transaction will never happen and after 24-48 hours you will get your BTC at your initial address 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:47:15
Probably is overloaded, especially if the expected time is changing to current all the time, so it’s expecting to group few transactions in one in order to save on fees, but if there is too many outgoing transactions, may be you’re on the pending Q. Don’t worry, I had the same issue today and after 40-50 min it went through smoothly 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:01:48
Which was the published date? I have order for them at 15th of September? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:04:43
Actually that's the normal fees at the moment, BTC doesn't make difference between $5 or $5M the fees are the same in most cases...
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:00:42
That's why use other crypto rather than BTC, for BTC now the fees are around $6-8 per transaction, for alternatives as LTC is around $0.01... 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:07:13
Of course they can see it, if you use only one address the change will be return at the same and everyone can see what you have left :) 
@_date: 2019-08-08 09:18:32
That’s definitely high fees. 2 days ago I sent 0.5 BTC (&gt;$6500) and I managed to pay 3sat/b or in other words I payed just over $0.07 for that. It managed to go through within 9h
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:35:23
Wait, is your balance zero, or your address is zero? If the address is zero, but you have balance on the exchange, that’s not a problem
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:54:59
Don’t worry, sometimes happen. The GDAX is overloaded at the moment. If I have problem like stuck on withdrawing window I just close it and refresh the page, usually after that my balalnce is zero and everything is alright 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:59:29
Fork was canceled 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:16:22
Coinbase is the easiest way. But use gdax instead, zero fees (or very low) 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:03:37
Or it will start sell off after couple of hours 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:23:45
Way early than April, I think middle of December 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:53:27
Take one Ledger Nano S, it’s Hardware Wallet and the easiest and most secure thing you will need in your life 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:03:22
Use gdax for no fees to buy and sell
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:19:40
You’re not missing the point, but don’t forget GDAX is exchange, so if something happen you don’t have the private keys, so you will loose the coins, if it’s in your private wallet which you know the keys, you actually own the coins 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:08:59
The same policy, and the same email you will receive if you have account for GDAX. They will close deposit and withdraw 24 before the fork, and you will have forked coins around 4h after the fork 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:33:59
Not so limited as BTC. See, BTC have at least 1M lost in the first couple of years from lost keys or wallets. Than you have 1M held by Satoshi Nakamoto. Than few thousand stolen by hackers from mt GOX, than few thousand confiscated by FBI (and than “resold”) and right now that total is 16M if possible 21M. Remove all the lost BTC and you will see that we might end up with only 18M real total supply available. 
I agree for Bitcoin Cash for the supply, but it’s way faster for confirmations and good to buy coffee. 
LTC is the best of all of them. Great supply 84M, every 2.5 min confirmations and plenty of space left in the blocks for transactions. Do you know that LTC uses only 4% of the available block space, so there is 96% more space for transactions? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:52:20
Yes you did 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:54:14
Check the sender of the email, it might be some sort of phishing link scam 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:05:13
Did you try with live.blockcypher.com, the are usually faster than anyone else 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:12:22
I hear that for first time, but I’m not surprised, I heard about Bitcoin Diamond �� 2 days ago and the futures are already listed 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:56:53
You won’t lose them, don’t worry. Close the withdrawing window and refresh the page. You should see the balance zero, don’t freak out, sometimes when gdax is overloaded it takes time, but always arrives or it’s returned. One time I had the same issue, zero balance, but no txt on the other end. It took 40 min delay before I saw the unconfirmed transaction on the blockchain 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:58:29
The fork was cancelled 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:12:11
Don’t use Electrum, it was compromised before, I personally use Hardware Wallet for the big amounts and for the small change I use Exodus. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:11:39
No, they don’t get nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:58:01
“Soon available in your country as well..”
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:20:45
Yes. Set up buy Limit Order, it will ask how many BTC you want and what price you’re willing to pay for them, when they reach your target price, it will auto fill and you not gonna pay fees as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:15:32
It make sense what you’re talking about, but BTC is asset like the gold, and because it’s so rare and limited, that’s why it’s good for savings. The crypto cash will be either BCH or LTC, faster transactions and cheaper fees for coffee 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:09:18
Same here, half of the savings into BTC, the wife doesn’t know... I hope it reaches $15 to cash out soon before she realizes that 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:11:07
It might never goes so low, till you’re waiting. Everyone thought it will go down after BTG, but it’s up with $1300.... if you have the money, buy at small chunks
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:52:19
It might someday hit $1M but it won’t be 2018 and you know it. I would say 2022 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:04:47
It will be not more than 48 hours 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:53:54
The 1 BTC is yours, the 0.4 BTC is the change. Check what is change address and you will figure it out. It’s not yours, rather that’s the change from the transaction which is going back to Coinbase’s address. 
The whole txt comes from one output with 1.04 BTC in it, you request 1 BTC only, and the change (0.4 BTC) is returned to the original sender. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:54:47
I don’t see what is the scam here, it’s completely her fault, come on, we are in 21st century, you have Internet in your pocket, don’t be so dumb people... she could easily check the story before she got full of cash envelope to the nearest BTC ATM...
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:40:42
Your question doesn’t make sense, that’s market, there is no fair game. What you do if there is only 2 breads in the store left? Do you take only one, and leave one for the next person, just to be generous, or you take as many as you need? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:46:39
I agree with you, I like BTC and I use it for asset more than money, I strongly believe In it, but if I have to be realistic, I won’t spend BTC for coffee, but I would spend BTC to buy house for example. That’s may be answer you my vision, BTC is asset which can be spend for greater things than coffee 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:05:35
I call $15k till mid December 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:17:51
I don’t want to tell you what to do, but you sent BTC for $10k and you didn’t bother to pay $1.2 fees? 
It won’t go probably, wait a day or cancel the transaction with right click at Bitcoin Core wallet
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:27:58
They look good, but for long term I would switch that Dodge to something like LTC or even BTC, you have big portion from your portfolio in Dodge, but if price spikes for it, I would relocate funds to LTC or BTC
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:37:30
Nothing innovative here, that’s simple HD wallet, it’s already available. Ledger Nano S works the same way 
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:59:25
I didn’t see piece of paper nowhere in your question. In my opinion is possible to make it, if it’s simple digital monochrome generator. I imagine it for businesses like that - simple monochrome square QR code generator, and each time customer wants to send funds to pay for coffee/tea or whatever, they click/press single button to generate new address for that. If you want the address to be changed automatically, I believe the whole device needs to be connected to internet to determine if the address is used or not. In my example the device can be portable and offline. It can be simple like Ledger Nano S, that’s why I gave example with it
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:20:43
No, don’t get me wrong, I don’t advice anyone to trade. I’m telling you sometimes trading have really great outcomes :) you take BTC emotionally and stack till became probably million. I take BTC as asset to make money for me right now, I don’t care about forks, “free coins” or else, I don’t get emotional with cryptos, I try to make money at the day, rather than long term. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:41:01
It’s all good man, I don’t like arguing for no reason, have a good day and forget about it :) 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:08:37
OMFG... Get a life man! BTC is not everything in life, you look so desperate to make money, that pisses me off. Make Limit Order and GDAX and do what you got to do without the drama here!
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:03:51
Yeah, he makes 2 BTC per day and still hosts his blog on "Wordpress"... come on, be real here, why you believe at shitty scams like that?
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:52:51
I don’t like cursing in Internet, but go f*ck yourself, will you? Did I force personally you or someone else to trade or did I get any benefits of making you join me? It’s my money and I will do whatever I decide so, I don’t see a reason for you to tell me what to do. Have a good one 
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:44:31
Every person you get to sign up you get 7% or his initial investment, so for every $100 you invest, he will take $7, for every $1000 he will get $70 and so on.
The most famous are BitConnect and Regal Coin 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:43:21
In both cases if you HODL BTC you will receive the same amount of the new created coin, which you can sell and buy BTC back. Treat Bitcoin Gold (25th of October) as dividend of loyalty, they will give them away and predictable price (speculative) will be around 10% of the BTC price or 0.1 BTC, which you can sell and convert back to BTC 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:47:58
You mean 10k man, what will be the point of “k” at the end if you write down 10 000?
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:20:45
Exactly that’s why I offer monochrome display like old digital clock and with click you can change the address easy. I don’t know and I’m not sure if it’s possible to print one barcode on paper and when you scan it every time to be different, I just don’t see it how it will happen if it’s not digital, but paper...
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:41:06
If you don’t want Segwit, you don’t use it. Legacy addresses will never expire and force people to switch to Segwit. So hypothetically you can use Legacy chain to infinity and you will never loose the coins. Segwit offers faster and cheaper transactions, but other than that is different chain, but in not in a case of different coin 
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:51:16
Nano S as well, but believe it or not most Americans have Trezor
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:44:11
But aren’t there 2 forks, at 25 of October for the Bitcoin Gold and November for the S2X? Is that mean 2  different coins or just one split (Bitcoin Gold)?
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:04:49
What fork you’re talking about man? Bitcoin Cash fork? I’m talking about the Bitcoin Gold fork at 25th this month. And after that I’m talking about Bitcoin S2X for next month. 
For selling alts for BTC is active now, so people can accumulate more BTC for the Bitcoin Gold fork at 25th of October 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:18:35
As far as I know, just hold the coins till 1st of the next month, than Ledger will post detailed  instructions how to extract them.
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:36:46
Of course will be a good, if you don’t open it, but just store, paper wallet will be ideal place 
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:11:04
Where did you see me convincing anyone of anything? I’m grown ass and I can take care for myself, if I want to trade, I will trade, if I loose I will loose, not you. I don’t see the point to be sarcastic, I don’t make you to trade at all. Have a good one :) 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:08:52
This month’s fork will be for Bitcoin Gold, that coin probably will die after few months, for the S2X will probably need to keep it longer to see which will survive, but I strongly believe Bitcoin Core (BTC) will be the winner 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:48:58
Ledger Nano S, KeepKey or Trezor are Hardware wallets 
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:45:21
I don’t think so, as you verify your identity for GDAX at Coinbase, so I can imagine that it’s not possible, sorry 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:14:23
That’s my opinion, every1 sells LTC, ethereum and other alts to take extra BTC for the forks. See the prices of LTC and ETH, they constantly drop compared to BTC which is ATH 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:23:24
November is the S2X fork, 25th of October is the Bitcoin Gold fork, there will be 2 forks for 2 months 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:59:08
You gonna be surprised:) I use Segwit as well, I haven’t got out any BTC but the last time I checked was 30 000 Satoshi fees, around €1
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:57:22
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:20:30
If BTC reach $100k everyone will buy, but Satoshis not whole BTC, because they will see for short period of time the price skyrocket, so it will be best investment plan, better than any other 
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:39:34
But without trading like me and traders, you won’t have a price increase because you hodlers, you don’t make the economy as you HODL, we make the price go up or down with trading. So for every buck you make, you need to be thankful to trades 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:45:04
Nobody knows which exchanges yet, but one is sure, it will be dumb to sell your coins on day one, as on day one wouldn’t be much trading, so the price will be the lowest 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:35:48
Right now it will continue jumping even more than $5k, but after 25th when is the fork I believe will drop with $1k as anyone will rebuy altcoins incl me, as I sold most of them to buy BTC for the fork 
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:40:27
Local bitcoins and to buy them with cash or bank transfer from reputable dealer 
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:02:28
Sometimes is good thing to do. Yesterday I made 0.2 BTC free only on the volatility. You tell me if it’s better than only hodling? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:21:12
No, that’s the passphrase which holds all of your private keys in one place. Breadwallet contains more than one address, it creates one new address every time there is a movement in or out. If you keep that 12 words, that will be enough to retrieve your prv keys 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:21:58
You had to do it a coupe of weeks ago. I moved half of my LTC and ETH as soon as the price reached €3800, right now is around €4300 and the LTC and ETH stayed the same. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:35:31
Yes, you can transfer freely, and yes there will be fees 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:39:01
You will receive the same amount of coins with including the decimal Satoshis you have at the moment they make the snapshot of the block at the moment of the fork 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:28:42
There is not much info about exchanges and I don’t know what to tell you, I’m wondering the same :) 
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:08:33
Paper wallet is to store the BTC and not to move it much, if you take them out will be to transfer the whole amount rather than move some chunks of it, as you’ve already expose your private keys. Any hot wallets on Internet are bad, because no matter how good and safe they look, they are hooked to internet and can be hacked, so you can loose your coins. With hardware wallets is different, they cannot be hacked because they need physical action in order to do transactions. 
Coinbase is easy to use, and if you’re a bit more advanced, you can buy without fees through GDAX platform. More for GDAX you can learn in YouTube, but basically it will safe you tons of money 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:06:14
Segwit or Legacy, BTC is the same, no problem accepting any of the chains, it’s a problem to send from Coinbase to Segwit addresses 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:56:21
They revoked the transaction and you need to have your coins back to your wallet 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:22:38
Both are fine, it doesn’t matter which. As long as you have them in the Ledger, you’re fine 
Segwit have lower fees, but whatever you choose, if you go with the innovations, go with Segwit 
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:40:57
BitConnect probably, it returns 1% per day interest, but holds your initial investment for about 8-10 months and than you can take it back. Probably is Ponzi, but a lot of people put money in it, incl me and I already get my investment cashed out, I realize it’s Ponzi, but I’m willing to risk :) 
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:50:34
As long as you have the private key, it’s fine 
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:17:45
Of course, as long as you know the private key and can retrieve the coins inside, you can top up unlimited :) 
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:39:29
Segwit or Legacy, the BTC is BTC no matter which chain it uses. See, if you’re talking about loosing, you might think of a bitcoin fork like Bitcoin Cash which is completely different coin. I personally use Segwit chain to store my BTC 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:11:58
I messed up the Litecoin subreddit for it, sorry BTC don’t have any problems with Segwit, it’s just LTC 
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:19:39
If you have up to 0.1 BTC it’s pretty safe. If you have 100 BTC will be dumb! Depends what is your fortune, it won’t be smart to have let’s say 100 BTC for half a million and not wanting to give $80 for Ledger Nano S...
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:04:25
Okey, that’s your point of view, but I wonder without exchanges and trading how you will tell what will be the price of certain currencies, without supply and demand you cannot talk about price increase or decrease... if it wasn’t Asia the last year, the price wouldn’t be so high right now, and they make all of that available through trading (demanding) more BTC that we could supply :) and the good thing will happen after couple of years, because the demand will be more, but the supply will decrease dramatically :) 
I wish you all the best man, I don’t engage you with my opinion, and to argue is useless. Have a good one :) 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:21:20
Than why are you asking us what to do, if you already know the answer? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:26:40
There is always risks in trading, as well as hodling
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:28:44
It might be, but BTG is estimated around 0.03 BTC at the moment 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:39:41
Ledger Nano S is the best 
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:25:35
Use GDAX, the same account as Coinbase, but zero fees to buy and sell. Look some tutorial how to use GDAX with zero fees on YouTube 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:58:01
That’s why people say “There is a lot of risk at the exchange”, sometimes you win, sometimes loose :) 
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:42:22
If you have Coinbase account, log in into GDAX with the same account and pay ZERO fees 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:07:33
You’re welcome :) 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:54:20
The best and most secure way that you will obtain forked coins will be to move them to wallet which you know the private keys. 
Coinbase announcement was that they will support the fork (at least B2X) but to be 101% sure I will say move them out of CB and GDAX to paper wallet or hardware wallet 
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:26:32
Thanks for the suggestion. I will reconsider my position :) 
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:06:18
The market believes the price is 5k because people are willing to pay it. Other than that BTC nowadays have a solid value, bacause to mine 1 BTC it cost miners over &amp;1.5k for electricity, mining power and current difficulty. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:20:00
Because you don’t know the private keys of the addresses on the exchange, but if you take them out you will know your private keys and that will be enough to claim forked coins. In order to claim the coins, you need to know the prv keys, because before the fork the alternative coins are in the same address with the same prv keys 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:37:40
He won’t do shit, he believed that the drop in the price was because of him, but we all know the truth, that who’s involved in BTC knows that his shits ain’t real
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:14:18
It should be fine as long as you know your private key. If you plan keeping it for long time, consider moving the BTC to paper wallet. But if you’ve already purchased hardware wallet, that wouldn’t be necessary 
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:01:38
Of course, like any other transaction. But I believe it’s not so bad, the last time I checked the transaction was around $1.2
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:37:27
Everybody starts withdrawing BTC right after the first tweet and Kraken realize they are fucked if that continue cuz probably they won’t have enough BTC to cover all the withdraws and they cannot trade, and after that they also realize Bittrex will support the fork, so that’s why was the second tweet 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:16:59
Both are fine, in Europe we buy more Ledger and we love it, most of the Americans have Trezor and they love it as well 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:11:33
For me it takes 1 day always, I send the money tonight and tomorrow at 8:00 I got them in my account, every single time and I made over 100 SEPA transfers to CB

I’m glad Bitcoin is so high and I hope it surpass this 100x Times and even more, but no matter what I will continue buying gold and that’s it, I love both BTC and gold :)

If so much you insist of buying BTC before the fork, instead of draining all your credit cards to the limit, go on localbitcoins and buy from person. It will be faster and the same money, if you pay on multiple exchanges the fees will be crazy high

It will happen at 25th this month, I would say 22nd will be deadline, than HODL

But Bitcoin Gold will still make you extra money which you can switch back to BTC

If you gonna keep it and not trading soon, paper wallet will be enough for storage. But if there is movement in and out of the wallet, or trading with high volume, I will suggest hardware wallet. 
Edit: Kraken is good option to purchase small amounts, but the easiest and user friendly is Coinbase

Depends how many BTC you have, and depends if you plan to take Bitcoin Gold to Exchange it for more BTC. If you have 10 or more BTC it will worth it, as predictable price of Bitcoin Gold will be somewhere between $100 and 0.05 BTC, if you’re entitle of 10 BTG, that will make you a profit of 0.5 BTC in the best scenario, which is good I believe :)

I’m not so crazy man, I leave it in my home, wherever I would leave them usually. But I’m stacking more than using for day trading, if you day trade you can take it :)

Next time send the coins from Coinbase to GDAX, and than send them to Ledger, that’s you gonna save all the fees, because withdrawing from GDAX is always Zero fees

I just see the trading as tool making money. I don’t get emotional for money the same way as you. In the stock market you can loose, in crypto world and especially BTC it’s almost impossible. You start trading with fiat, but end up with BTC, if you keep your fiat it’s win, if you buy higher for BTC it’s win again, eventually you will get your money back in the  next 2 weeks. I play with money I’m willing to loose, and in difference from you, I don’t stack them for the bright future, i try to make the best out of them for short period of time. If the price of BTC goes up it will be because of people like me - traders, not from hodlers :) 
So in order for you to win money, you need to be thankful to traders

The fork will be at 25th of October, but they will give you the BTG at 1st next month, but once they make the snapshot of the block chain you can remove them, I will say just to wait 1 day after the fork and move them to GDAX

Trezor is hardware wallet, Electrum is software “hot” wallet, I don’t know what you want to ask with that question, but I assume you’re asking if you can use Trezor or Ledger with Electrum? If that’s the question, the answer is yes, you can use Hardware Wallet with Electrum.
Otherwise Trezor and Ledger have their own software, so you don’t have to use different wallet other than the native apps made for the hardware wallets

Yes

Don’t worry, till you cash out the BTC it might be already over $5k, as right now Bitcoin is pumping like crazy, you might like the restriction at the end :)
