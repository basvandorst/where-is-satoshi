I'm not invested in Bitcoin anymore there's already numerous different variations of block chain that are better at nearly every aspect of currency than Bitcoin is. , I made 1,500% profit from bitcoin in 2017 and in December when it hit $20K I sold all of mine, my portfolio is now comprised of Altcoins that I have heavily researched and even after this big correction and everyone is panicking I'm still at a profit and even Planning on increasing my portfolio even more considering everything is over 50% off.

Yes but if you look at past movements this litterally happens every January, this is just a correction from the December holiday hype , that has happened nearly every kid January for the past 5+ years.

This is nothing out of the ordinary , nearly every January a large correction happens after December spikes, it happened in 2015 , 2016 and 2017, this is no different

What makes you think that?

Lol you think people use GPU's for mining Bitcoin? , They have Asics for that which are 100 times more effecient and cheaper than using gpu for Bitcoin mining, GPU 's are used for mining ethereum, Zcash, and other more profitable algorithms.

Yea and the only reason that happened was because of Mt.Gox hack that caused massive FUD across the Bitcoin community , what we are experiencing now is litterally just a normal crypto January , this happens every year , the market spikes around November -december then January comes around and holidays end and all the Chinese sell for Chinese New year's and to go on vacations and then we get a market correction where all the newcomers start panicking because they think crypto is crashing to 0 . This has happened nearly every January for the past 5+ years in crypto , just zoom into Bitcoin chart for December 2016 to january 2017 for proof.
