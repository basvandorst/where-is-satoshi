nChain's CTO, Steve Shadders, is nearly as technically incompetent as Craig Wright. He was tasked to give a list of addresses based on six criteria. This was a simple task that should have taken [hours at most and under 100 lines of code]( 
Instead, he took two weeks and bodged it in at least **three** different ways:
* He incorrectly treated a byte as signed, resulting in thousands of addresses that should not have been included
* He said "multiple output coinbases" eliminated 68 addresses from the list. This is wrong. It eliminated zero.
* He said he used the Bitcoin, BCH and BSV chains to analyse the addresses. This is wrong. He included several addresses that spent coinbases on the Bitcoin chain that were still unspent on BSV.
Again, this is the **CTO** of BSV's parent company. Is it any wonder the employees think Craig Wright is Satoshi?

So multiple companies who make money on having as complete and accurate records as possible agree on this domain not existing before April, 2009, and that means **fuck all** because they are not 'official record keepers'? Are 'official record keepers' immune from errors? It's **worthless** evidence because they are for-profit companies? You don't think their reputation and business wold be hurt if a competitor pointed out their mistakes? 
Your argument boils down to "maybe they missed a registration." You don't give anything to back that up, and resort to insults when called out. Your downvotes are well-deserved.

Well, you've won me over with that compelling argument.

Nah, what's worth **extremely little** is an assertion backed up by nothing but hand-waving and insults.

DomainTools isn't some random company. And there are several other companies that provide historical whois information, so it can be checked with fairly high certainty.

If I were Satoshi, I'd just sit back and enjoy the laughs. Wright has already thoroughly discredited himself.
