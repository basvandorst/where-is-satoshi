I use paper wallets and electrum when i need to move the coins, what should i do?
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:03:22
not very inspiring:
* the molotov cocktail guy give it a bad impression.
* "you are the bank" is not very appealing too, people doesn't want to be a bank, it's one more thing for them to worry about.
* to the lay person the term Peer to peer = rocket science, try explaining dns, firewall, vpn and you will get the same reaction.
Remember, **KISS**

What about a torrent client linked to a wallet? that when you download something, it tips automatically and proportionally to the seeders.
and when you upload/seed things you can get rewarded by others users tips
peers and seeders would need to have this client too, but maybe its a good idea to work on :)

What happens to burned coins? can't burned coins be redirected to miners instead of an unused address?
@_date: 2014-12-22 20:59:48
What about side-chains? how do they work? and could they flood the market with new sidecoins driving down the value of BTC?

My Gf said that until the it's not happening until places like fish-shops accepts bitcoin. until it doesn't happens, I'm crazy.
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:43:16
I liked  
have a tip for that

My girlfriend think I'm crazy and I'll only convince her that bitcoin is the future when business like fish shops accepts it.
meanwhile I'm buying computers with it, apparently, gas is next :)
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:14:07
sure.. bitcoin is a niche of a niche.
don't think we can generate much traffic
@_date: 2014-10-22 00:15:43
one thing I can see in the future is stores scamming people with these uBTC, mBTC/ millibits and microbits, bits BTC..
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:42:08
I was going to tip you but since you already use bitcoins I have no incentives.
.... 100 bits @_date: 2015-05-26 22:22:36
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the risk here isn't about the block size itself, it's about the hardfork.
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:19:34
I've heard that bitcoin is not scalable, can someone explain?
Imagine 7bi people making min 3 transactions a day, would the bitcoin environment support it?
@_date: 2015-01-08 13:38:34
this is confusing
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:32:09
Nice.. Also we need to convince farmers, miners and fishers to accept and keep bitcoins
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:47:46
I've used it.. It works, you just need to choose someone with good reputarion, like ebay. Never had a problem.
@_date: 2015-01-08 10:19:01

had no idea of who Tim Draper is. Was expecting someone who bought 2000 bits for $200 total and thinks it's full bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:35:25
I don't give bitcoin to my relatives because they don't value it as they should.
I mean, they are getting them for free.. If they get BTC as a payment for a product / service they sell they will value it as much as money.

And how will they hold theirs BTCs?
smartphone there are [luxury]( items now.

LA as a whole thinks that everything that comes from US as evil. instead they prefer to circlejerk around cuba and venezuela.
if US is equal to "capitalism" then capitalism must be evil. 
if USSR fought capitalism. They fought agaisnt evil. Then the USSR must be the good guy.
Ohh, shit. USSR imploded, let's find a substitute... China.... NK... Cuba!! 
Yes, Cuba! why not?
Cuba is near and we don't need to speak chinese of korean with them.

DDG implemented this way earlier than Google.

"Recibiras de forma transparente el dinero correspondiente a la venta en tu conta de mercadopago"
Can I chose to recieve in BTC instead of MercadoPago Currency or fiat?
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:49:10
Just type "usd btc" and it gives the conversion
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:03:31
hope that I can withdraw in bitcoins
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:20:57
ok ok ok, let's clear the things up here..
There's no such thing as Satan/Devil worshipers on Satanism.
From [the Church of Satan:](








Also, from [the Satanic Templo of Detroit:](




Satanism is basically a Anti-Religion. They question and are against the force of religion on society.
They question holidays, marriage, traditions, monuments, statues etc.. They aren't against those things, they are against the presence of religion on those things.
I think the movement is very funny, rational and very troll too. Because the Govt must treat every religion equally the Satanists [urged for a place for the statue of Lucifer]( They say "if others religions have the right of having theirs simbols on squares, than we have it too"
To end my point:

isn't it unsafe to used old/spent addresses?
@_date: 2015-09-02 00:52:39
didn't said it isn't
@_date: 2015-09-30 12:02:07
actually they have their own currency there (MercadoPago Credits).
you can use as regular money to buy things there but if you want to withdraw it, they will take a percentage
@_date: 2015-09-28 12:08:03
problems that cant be solved without a good currency
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:06:04
BR here. Our currency value is collapsing (and USD is gaining value), bitcoin is a great way to protect against it. it's a way to buy dollars without the bureaucracy of buying dollars..
last year, 1 USD = 2,30 BRL
Today, 1 USD =  3,65 BRL
Don't think more brazilians are using BTC, I think the same brazilians are buying more BTC.

The same applies to USA, China, Ukraine, Argentina, UK, etc..
We tend to think that specially our country has the most stupid people. But people are stupid all over the world, this will never change.

Are we libertarians trully growing?
I don't see Novo going anywhere and the socialist mentality is craved in our constitution. I really see no future here.

This blew my mind. 
People here doesn't seem very impressed.
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:59:46
they accept Flattr, which accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-05 12:50:05
Price stability;
No more super-early-adopters hysteria;
also maybe, lack of new blood?

Bitcoin, Craziest thing since internet
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:23:16
They'll probably just buy dollars..
I don't see people looking for bitcoin over here yet. Our merchants are not adopting it.
besides, our inflation is too low (7,5%/y) compared to our neighbor, Argentina.
ps: If we complain about inflation our elder and parents say "back in my day it used to be 200% so you cant complain about 7%" sigh...
@_date: 2015-10-26 19:05:41
You know that Telegram has a bitcoin wallet right? 
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:53:00
KeePass is also open source &amp; free
they differ because KeePass uses .net/mono while KeePassX doesn't
