There's at least one reasonable way to approach this in Bitcoin, which is a multi signature transaction involving three parties, one of them acting as an arbiter.

I like to call it fascism. Socialism is about democracy in the workplace and bottom-up decision making. Venezuela is the oposite of a democracy, completely top-down ruling by an elite. Capitalism is also turning into top-down fascism, but the elite is corporations merged with government.

If I understand it correctly, the energy consumption of Bitcoin doesn't grow with the market cap, it will always be 1 block mined every 10 minutes. The number of transactions doesn't increase the block difficulty, only its size. It will grow as miners competition grows but I'd believe that'd be on a different and smaller scale.

Source:  I promise I didn't edit Wikipedia myself. Many capitalist countries have turned into fascism as well throughout history.  It happens whenever power is taken away from the people, whatever the political system is.

Bitcoin energy also goes into "finding them", we call it mining. Storing bitcoin uses virtually no energy, probably even less than storing gold.

Yes, but it's very promising nonetheless. Both internet service and power supply could potentially be decentralized. Even phone production with 3d printing.
