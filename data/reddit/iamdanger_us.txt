I've never used a research chemical in my life (I'm not even 100% sure what one is, but I have my suspicions), but I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding about how laws work. Laws generally tell us what is not allowed, meaning that if there's no law against something it's implicitly allowed.

Did you actually look at my link? You said 1000% returns. DCA strategy of $50 every two weeks over the last five years (half of bitcoin's life, definitely was not pennies a coin in 2014) nets a return of 1100%+. A 1000% return from 10k is 100k. If you actually start and stick to a DCA strategy I do believe you can still get 1000%+ returns from our current prices within the next 5-10 years.

Oh and to be clear I am shit about practicing what I preach... I talk a lot about DCA but am not great about sticking to it. That link represents what my portfolio *could* have been. I tried to time the market and so my numbers don't look as good as if I'd just stuck to DCA. I was kind of bummed at first when I saw that, but if anything it has caused me to rededicate myself to the DCA strategy and actually stick with it this time. Hopefully in 5+ years that will pay off.

You are just as full of crap (there, I didn't cuss) as the last time you posted, and clearly just spamming your dumb website trying to get gullible people to give you money. You posted when BTC was at ~9000 that "This is just the beginning of the fall." The [top comment on that post]( points out you said the price was going to "tank" when it was at ~7800 roughly a month before that.
You are not special, you don't have any insight, it's clear from looking at your post history that you sell doom-and-gloom, sky-is-falling panic to people who probably invested more than they could afford to lose. Your posts all link to your website and frankly you should be banned for spamming reddit and violating site-wide rules about self-promotion.
And before OP accuses me of being a troll (his go to when challenged), anyone can look at my profile and verify who I am. I post under my real name and am very easy to find online.

I still bank with Unitus despite moving to NW WA a year and a half ago... I never asked them directly about crypto so I can’t tell you how that conversation will go, but I will say that I am in the process of looking at local credit unions in my new town so I can move my banking to some place with more ties to the area. I contacted three credit unions and specifically asked them about using an account for crypto currency purchases and sales. One said no, the other two said yes. One of the two that said yes asked me to call and speak with one of their VPs, which I figured meant they were going to say no. You can imagine my surprise when I had a great 10 minute conversation with her about crypto and the impact it has had on traditional markets—she even told me that her son is a huge fan of bitcoin and ethereum and buys both! While I understand the sentiment in this thread, and it would almost certainly make *opening* an account much easier, I personally prefer no ambiguity whenever possible. I’d suggest just reaching out to banks by phone or via social media until you find one that is not opposed to you using your account for crypto. My fear with not mentioning it would be that the bank finds out, is not okay with it, and abruptly closes your account. Best of luck in your search!

This is possibly the worst article I’ve seen on r/bitcoin, which is saying something.

Usually while they have access to your account they write down the seed phrase... once you put money in they use the seed to restore the wallet and move the funds to a new address. Your blockchain account password is separate from the seed, so this provides the illusion that you are somehow blocking access when you change it. 
You were wise to be skeptical.

I *worked* for Chase when I was 21. Mortgage collections. Absolute shit job btw. I banked with Bank One and had direct deposit set up. Chase bought Bank One, then I quit (not because of that, simply because being a mortgage collector was awful). Apparently Chase overpaid me. What do I know, I’m a young kid? They never notified me or anything. No call, no letter, just withdrew the $400 overpayment from my account, over drafting it. I had been a Bank One customer for like 5 years, zero consideration given. I switched to a credit union years ago and haven’t regretted it for a second. One of the reasons I love bitcoin now is because of this experience (and a few others).

This is such an awesome thread. First guy says opinions are not facts, then you chime in to tell him he is wrong (and reference a centralized shitcoin as "proof"). You can't be wrong about an opinion, dork. You reference a price chart and say it's a "very high price level right now" (quality TA btw, though tbf all TA is pretty much guessing at the future psychology of markets), but realistically when BTC hits 6 figures and beyond buying at 8k, 11k, 6k, will be rounding errors.

Careful what you wish for, man. I'll be 39 this year and I will say that time seems to pass more quickly the older I get. I do hear you about wanting to be a bit more well off... I wouldn't say I've 'made it', but my financial woes aren't what they were in my 20s (though I will say that they are different, and more stressful, even though I no longer worry about paying my bills)... but some of the shit I went through to get here was essential to both making it to this point and making me into this person. 
Just to give one example, I'm getting married in 2 months. We've been together a little over 5 years. Shortly after we started dating, I was let go from a job and ended up spending a bit of time unemployed and trying to figure out my next move. We had only been dating for 2 weeks when this happened, but she stuck around through that pretty hectic period of my life. It wasn't easy, but the plus side is that I know she isn't with me for money... I literally had almost none right after we started dating! ;)
Anyway, this is r/bitcoin and not r/lifeadvice, so apologies for straying a bit off course. My main point is to savor those moments while you keep up that awesome DCA... You'll get there. I have a similar strategy so I'm hoping we'll see similar rewards.

Timing the market is very tricky and is (IMO) almost 100% luck. If you think bitcoin is a decent thing to buy and hold for awhile (I’d say a year, assuming you’re in the US), then dollar cost average is the best way to go. If you want to buy, say, $500 usd worth of bitcoin, buy $100 worth over 5 days. It’s how I usually buy. Sometimes I’ll do multiple buys in a day. I do personally think bitcoin will reach a period in time where it will never be 4 figures ever again. Is that time now? No idea. But it is coming.

If you've been doing DCA to try to get back to even, that's great... but you have to stick with it. Also, your early trades are probably what is causing that red, because if you had stuck to DCA since Dec 2017 it would look like this:  (spoiler: you'd have profits above 30% using a strict DCA method of $10 a week since Dec 2017).
Don't feel bad... I've been in this space for 5 years, but haven't done a great job of following my own advice. I have made some profits, but honestly [nowhere near what I would have made]( in that time if I had just DCA'd $50 per paycheck.

The reason you don’t see Robinhood talked about much here is because you’re not actually buying bitcoin. It’s not an exchange, or a wallet.

You should probably charge *something* for mason, as consumers tend to view free goods as low quality/cheap. If you put a price point of, say, ₿ 0.0006 (approximately $0.50), consumers will think they are getting a bargain discount on a high value item.

Heck, or even a true positive, but you're not the one who used or acquired the coins illegally. Example would be someone who uses a P2P service such as Bisq (or craigslist) to buy (or exchange goods for) bitcoin that is "blocked" due to association with past illegal activity. Why should that person be punished? How would an individual user of bitcoin be able to protect against this?

Interesting legal question that arises since you are not actually buying cryptocurrency on some platforms, such as robinhood (the largest example I know of, perhaps there are others). If I buy and sell on robinhood, I've never actually owned any bitcoin or other crypto, I'm simply making a bet on its price. (Not tax advice, obviously... I am guessing the IRS probably would consider robinhood activity to count for the purposes of their new question.)

I do think there are better branding opportunities that could highlight some of the key differentiators vs Youtube. I'm not a marketing person, but maybe something like noblock.tv or 4ever.tube, I honestly have no idea. But I know that Bitchute is a terrible name (sorry), as is Dtube. On the plus side, the space is still really new and growing so I'm sure eventually someone will come up with something or an existing service will rebrand.

Bitcoin is pseudonymous, which is not the same as anonymous.

(seti has still not detected any alien intelligence, as far as I know anyway, and I quit running the software around 2012.)
I just thought bitcoin was a cool idea but it didn't click with me until several years had passed. I met a guy who brought up many other aspects of btc I had previously missed: censorship resistance, banking the unbanked (something I personally empathize with despite living in a first-world country, since I was unable to open a bank account for several years in my youth due to some poor financial planning on my part), immune to seizure with proper care, aspects of game theory in PoW, etc. We talked about it a lot, I read the whitepaper, and I was hooked on the idea from there. Been involved in the space since.
Ultimately, I think a lot of internet nerds may have heard about bitcoin in the earlier days but didn't get involved because they didn't see any personal relevance or need.

This is such an unfortunate attitude. While I don’t like bitpay either, you have to realize that a ton of businesses these days are data-driven. You can damn well believe that companies are checking to see if users take advantage of things like new payment options. If nobody is paying with bitcoin via bitpay, what incentive does the company have to make any changes or improvements to their existing process? Just something to consider.

Definitely good advice, though not totally applicable in this case... I wouldn't be terribly impacted if that money never returned (though it's enough that I'm still going to work to get it back... it's a little over a day's worth of wages at my job). It falls squarely into the "could afford to lose" category for me though. The account that I used is mainly just used for crypto and other small investments (such as stocks in Robinhood), and I transfer the amount I'm buying into it, usually plus a little extra, and then make the transaction. Every few months I take the extra amount that has built up and buy bitcoin or stocks with it. As a holder, I'm also very bad at rule 2. ;)

The halving isn’t really related to mining difficulty, which adjusts as needed based on miner activity. The halving means the number of bitcoin awarded to miners is, well, halved. Currently it’s 12.5 bitcoin every ten minutes. After the next halving it will be 6.25.

Not true though. If mining activity decreases after halving, the mining difficulty will adjust, which has happened in the past. Your comment made it sound as if mining difficulty only adjusts at halving events, which is false.

Hi, Washington resident here, and my experience is not even close to what you suggest. No dispensaries by my house (NW WA) take debit cards directly. The dispensary closest to my house started "accepting debit cards", but what you're actually doing is buying some altcoin (can't remember the name, it was one I'd never heard of and I've been following cryptocurrencies since 2014) with your debit card and then using that to buy. I asked them if I could just pay directly with crypto and they said they aren't set up for that. :-\

There’s still a lot of room for growth when it comes to real-world spending opportunities. I spent the last two weeks in England, Wales, and Ireland. Spent several days in two major cities (London and Dublin), so figured I’d be able to spend some bitcoin there, but no such luck. Wasn’t able to meet up with the one taxi driver in London I found who accepted BTC (shoutout to  on Twitter). I found a place in Dublin that was listed as accepting crypto (Berlin D2), but when I got there they had a sign for some app I’ve never heard of (Feipay), only accepted LTC and ETH (wtf?), and none of the employees really knew how to accept payment. We just gave up and used a credit card. I did get to buy a few bitcoin lotto tickets using BTC, but it was a multi-step process with a somewhat high barrier of entry from a technical standpoint. 
Ironically the closest I got to a p2p transaction was with the lady who owned the sheep farm where we stayed in Wicklow County, Ireland. We owed her money for breakfast so I mentioned bitcoin. She and her husband laughed but then seemed more interested after we talked about it. She even watched a 20 minute Andreas video I sent her, but ultimately said she wasn’t quite ready to take the plunge until she had a chance to learn more. Anyway, there’s a lot of room for improvement when it comes to spending bitcoin in the real world... let’s not kid ourselves.

The concept of credit unions is better than the reality, but like most things in life it can depend a lot on context. I bank with two regional credit unions in the PNW (Unitus and Industrial) and haven't run into too many issues. Then again, I called around before picking my current local bank (Industrial) to make sure that I wouldn't run into trouble with using the account for buying and selling cryptocurrency. Some local credit unions (looking at you, North Coast) gave some BS answers about "policy" and "illegal activity", so I stayed away from them.
And while I agree with you that in general credit unions &gt; banks, the reality is that you don't "control" your money any more if it's with a credit union vs a traditional bank, at least not in any real sense. That's the beauty of crypto--it offers *real* control over one's money, although that does come with risk as well. I just think it's interesting that any traditional financial entity would introduce the concept of ownership/control to their customers when there's a competing system that more strongly checks the box for that feature.

I took a road trip from Oregon to Ohio in 2014 and didn't have to stop at an ATM once. I'd post ads on localbitcoins.com a day or two in advance of stopping in a particular city and set up meets. It was a lot of fun!

You *can* just ignore it. I've followed this sub for 5+ years and the negativity always ramps up during a bear cycle... just as the TO THE MOOOOON sentiment ramps up during a bull run. I try to ignore that stuff and just focus on the actual news and tech discussion that gets posted. Not always easy, but it is possible.
