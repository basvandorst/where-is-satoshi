People aren't hoping for the collapse of the US dollar. We believe that there are fundamental flaws in fiat money that could possibly lead to its downfall, as we have seen countless times. Bitcoin is an experiment in creating a hard money that can be utilized by anyone with an internet connection as a hedge against these potential outcomes such as hyperinflation.

If you and five other people are in a room and they decide to rob you, is it not theft but consensus?

To say that you have the right to someones property is to say that you have a claim to the labor he or she performed to obtain it. To say you have a claim to his or her labor is to make them a slave.

It disappointing to see people condemning McAfee for this especially in bitcoin circles.

Can I build a road that you never asked for/wanted/consented to, hold you at gunpoint and take half of the money that you worked for, and then ask you to thank me for what I’ve done for you?

I have no problem with property rights being enforced by violence when their own property is being threatened . I do have a problem with others using violence to take what they have not rightfully earned/created. When did I ever say that people will not attempt to take what is not theirs? There are plenty of criminals in the world. That does not mean that they should be supported or looked upon as a necessary evil. Just because people can conquer you and take your possessions doesn’t mean it is moral to do so. What I was saying had nothing to do with your response. Take your condescending strawman and go pick some boots.

Again, I’ve never said that it will hold off a conquering force. “Criminal” is not a statist concept. It is a concept that imply a that there is an objective standard for good and evil. Where we seem to disagree is that I believe that such an objective standard exists, and it includes a right to one’s life and the means one uses to sustain their life, while you do not

If you want an objective answer to that question you've come to the wrong sub. If you do, educate yourself on its mechanics and how to store your bitcoin safely beforehand

He's going to die in prison(while he appears to be framed) but hey at least he can write out small notes to be passed along to others that then post it on Twitter.
