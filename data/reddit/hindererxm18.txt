Raven pumped heavily over the last month and is still pumped. I’m not exiting my position from mining profits as I see long term value. When price is pumped you mine less coins but evens out over time. I’m running 2 mining rigs with 6 thx 1070ti on one and the other has 4 1080s. Raven uses x16s algo and is easily mined by anyone with a computer with a decent video card. Anything 1050ti and above. You need to use a mining pool like ravenminer and setup instructions for your miner are easily googled. I converted half of my raven holdings to Litecoin on a previous large pump and just holding now. Btw the x16s algo is more asic miner resistant than something like Litecoin or bitcoin. It’s not worth it at all to directly mine bitcoin or Litecoin with regular computer hardware and requires expensive ASIC miners to do any good. Whattomine.com would be most helpful to look at for you. Select your cards and see how much you would make per day mining any particular currency.

Mine Raven Coin (RVN) and convert it to BTC if you like. Or just buy bitcoin weekly on Coinbase or another option is daily buys with CoinSeed.

Nice! my first hardware device was the TREZOR Model T. I like it so far. I’m specifically loading BTC and LTC for long term holds buying over time and putting all trading profits into it.

I sold all my BTC LTC and ETH positions about 9 hours ago around 4985 btc level. Have been in those from around 3450 BTC level and couldn’t risk not locking that profit in on such a huge percentage gain. Crazy day that was sure fun, but I’ve learned my lesson over the last 3 years and that’s to sell when you get a spike of this magnitude in such a short time span and wait for some pullback. Looking for re-entry around 4K level. I don’t believe we will see a Dec 2017 run again in the short term future. But do think it has a chance to happen in 4-6 months from now. Just my .02 sats

Buying mass amounts of 5.56 and 9mm ammunition is also a good hedge. Thinking worst case.

I always tell them how lucrative it’s been for me even with the pullbacks. I’m thousands of % up since I started. I made the most I ever have in a single trade this past July in a bear market. I hold BTC to as a hedge against the dollar. I play around and speculate with my non BTC holdings to increase my BTC holdings. I’m also long term holding LTC and DGB as a speculative investment.  Different reasons for different bags. The friends/coworkers who said me getting into crypto was dumb have changed their minds after I told them about my gains when they asked. I do spend about 3-4hours of time each day looking at charts,planning/executing trades, and reading latest crypto news/cryptotwitter. They say they don’t have time for that. I tell them they don’t need to... just buy a little bit each week of BTC and a smaller percentage of DGB and LTC and just hold. Don’t look at charts or even worry about it. There’s a trading investing style that can work for everyone regardless of skill level. I want to maximize my stash in the quickest way possible so I take some risky trades and spend more time trading/researching/setting alerts.

Yeah!!!! Never put your coins on an exchange. Instead meet internet people in person and sit there with them for 15min to 2hours to transact and pray they don’t rob you. Lol

I personally think anything that can sway the market price on an exchange by 1-2% is very whale-ish. Not sure what that is all the time because some books can get rather thin. But assuming it’s around 900-1000BTC at some points.

I think a floor safe in basement concrete is the perfect storage place for heat sensitive materials. Unless the safe is extremely fireproof a house fire can still melt contents.

Just use cashapp and get the debit card for free with it to use. if you need emergency money you can convert some bitcoin and spend instantly. I have a daily buy of 20 and every morning convert that 20 into BTC. Takes seconds.

Is that like an 8 track?

Whole Foods had no idea what I was talking about and their manager didn’t either. Store in Kentucky. The cashier smirked about my magic internet money.
I gave up and used cashapp card on Apple Pay and converted some BTC to $ while standing in line. To me this is the fastest way to spend bitcoin at a store for now.

I’m one of them as of July(feels good). Working on my 100 LTC now. Keep everything on Trezor Model T. Holding 250k DGB just in case on it as well. Never know...

I appreciate ammunition. You can barter with it if everything collapses. You can hunt with it for food. You can protect yourself and your possessions. This my secondary investment to bitcoin.
