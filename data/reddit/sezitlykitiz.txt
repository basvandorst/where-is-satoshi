When a stock or commodity rises up, especially rises up a lot in a short time, quite a few people start selling, which causes a short drop in price. At some point, the sellers have sold and then the price starts rising again. Of course this happens the other way round too in a bear run.

You WANT the skeptics to learn and adopt, otherwise we are all circlejerking and bitcoin will never go anywhere.

That's like saying horse carriages were a mistake because cars. 
Fiat is not a mistake. It's a technology useful on our path to progress, which was great for it's time. In a world without global communication and without the technology we have today, it was necessary for a central authority to issue a currency so that merchants would stop arguing over whose beads are more valuable.

In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony fiat. But because, I am enlightened by my bitcoin.

Forget fishcoin. I hear Schrute Bucks and Stanley Nickels are the new thing of the future.

Dont do ANYTHING on that laptop. Install Recuva or some similar recovery software using another computer on a portable harddrive, and have it scan your laptop's hard drive to recover files. Then go through everything it recovers and hope that your screenshot is in it. 
If you are not sure that the screenshot has been deleted or not, just search for and go through every image file on your laptop.

Before regulation, we had child labor, asbestos in construction, lead in gasoline, polluting factories next to living settlements, little regard for worker safety, charlatans posing as doctors, no food safety requirements, etc. 
That said, I agree with the overall point of your comment.

Obviously you know nothing about India or the Reserve Bank of India. And even if it were corrupt, it has no advantage in deliberately misleading people for no apparent gain.... unless... oh, right, this is a huge conspiracy because they are themselves buying lots of bitcoin, right? Do you really expect them to endorse bitcoin this early in the game? Can you imagine the pitchforks coming out were bitcoin to fail?
