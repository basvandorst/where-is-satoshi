Well they keep expanding to new countries. Meanwhile i see plenty of such cancelation complaints on reddit etc. They have to improve their quality of service. And im miffed at the negative reaction i got frm users here when i shared my user experience.

Im not looking for any troubleshooting advice. This cancellation problem is one faced by many here. I was just raising my voice in the bitcoin forum. And talking about my experience. And i think this is the relevant subreddit for that

I made a similar post making the same complaint a few days ago. Some dumbos started downvoting me saying it was just me shilling. Pisses me off how people get this sort of 'im right you're wrong' syndrome even when the other person has a genuine issue.

thank u. ill just keep emailing them
@_date: 2014-10-31 07:16:39
can u suggest good alternatives?

I think theyre gaming us. They sell to us when the price suits them. When it doesnt: hi risk, order cancelled
@_date: 2014-10-30 22:26:13
This guy seems like a shill
@_date: 2014-10-31 07:17:14
good for you. i suggest u google coinbase order cancellations.

Still dont see the bitcoin logo

ive emailed them multiple times. ive also realised that these 'canceled orders' seem to increase in frequency when the price is really fluctuating. it makes me a little suspicious that all is not as it seems at coinbase.

What is your buy/sell frequency? I just bought a few bitcoins. The first transactions went ok. The other ones not so well. 
Also, i myself would like to know whats hi risk about that !
