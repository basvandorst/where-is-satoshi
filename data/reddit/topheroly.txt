Nothing too fancy, but suitable for this subreddit.

lol.... But why.  There's nothing phishy on the site.   
Edit: What causes this and what can I do to fix it?

Good thing North Dakota energy prices are dirt cheap. $0.05/kWh

In the short term, sure, but it's supposed to show that pool luck is completely random and is not affected by any outside sources.  If there was anything wonky going on, it would be easy to see.
Edit: As I mentioned in the thread over at the forums, I meant to imply that if there were any intrinsic errors in the pushpool code or stuff like that it would be possible to detect.  Otherwise it would be very difficult.

It was a god damn rocket ship climbing.

I saw there was some interest in this and threw together the site this past week.  It also now scrapes 6 of the top pools currently instead of the initial three.  If you want a larger image, just click on the graph.  The shaded gray areas around the fitted curve represent a 95% confidence interval.
Quick word about the histograms, I only just recently added bitcoins.lc so they are a bit fucked (the kernel density estimate doesn't play well with few data points).  In a few days the histograms will settle down to what they should be.  
On the stats page the q's represent quantiles of the dataset during the specified time period.
Luck does not give an indication of future performance since these events are independent, this is only neat to look at and graph and hence why I put it up for people to see.
If you have any questions or suggestions on what to add to the site please let me know.

If you have any questions about what I did to get this image let me know.  If there's enough interest I might throw up a site with an updating display every day or so.
Forgot to mention, the circle sizes on the first panel represent the length of time estimate for luck. The small dots represent a 6hr window, the medium dots a 12hr window and the large dots a 24hr window.
Edit: an kind IRC goer has added this image to his server that will update daily.  
Edit2: More in-depth discussion on the bitcoin forums

I found this through IRC a few minutes ago, chances are it's already been passed around a bit before a public paste. 
Edit: It looks like that amounts to about 14.5% of all the passwords available in the accounts.csv file.

Well we have an a pretty accurate graph of network hashing power since the beginning over at  .  All we would really have to do integrate that area to get a total Gigahash/s estimate.  Then, convert it to some metric via the processing power a normal computer can do.

In a nutshell yea, I'm also fitting a loess line and it's confidence interval, more discussion is on the bitcoin forum page if you are curious.
@_date: 2011-08-10 00:16:27
Thanks for the heads up, doing that now.
@_date: 2011-07-31 21:11:38
Sure, I'll add that to my to-do list, It will be added soon enough.

Once logged in, they do specify they are considering alternatives for withdrawal/deposits.  Here's hoping that's the case.
"More transfer, withdrawal and payment options are under consideration and will appear here as they become available"
