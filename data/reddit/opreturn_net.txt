There's one bitcoin address that currently has 85000 coins: 183hmJGRuTEi2YDCWy5iozY8rZtFwVgahM
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:01:22
Just to nitpick - but bitcoin is technically anonymous, as in, it is without names. It's Coinbase and similar exchanges that are not anonymous.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:20:14
And another way that this article is wrong - you state that 


So your calculation assumes that Sycamore is competing with a single conventional bitcoin miner, when in reality, there are many millions of miners working at a given moment.
Really terrible article. It's embarrassing. You should delete it.
@_date: 2019-10-14 01:22:36


Hi, just to clarify this answer - the value of the outputs should actually be less than the value of inputs, as this determines the fee paid to the miner.

If you're just receiving bitcoin from someone, your wallet address is all they need to know. It looks like many others have already recommended wallets to you and none of those will need your name. However, if you go to sell this bitcoin for dollars, most exchanges will require you to supply your name and some id.
@_date: 2019-10-15 04:01:40
Sure. I just sent you a PM with a link to an address with the private key and some dogecoin on it. Instructions on building, signing, and broadcasting the transactions are at the site. Let me know if everything makes sense.
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:58:34
The article is wrong about the bitcoin difficulty adjustment. It's not measured in minutes but rather in blocks (2016). So even if quantum computers can mine a block in a microsecond, after 2016 blocks were mined the difficulty would adjust for the rate, and quantum computers would be back to mining blocks to every 10 minutes.

Ok, gotcha. Yes, I'm familiar with Master Public Key, it's abbreviation just didn't register with me last night. You may be aware of it, but if not, I suggest taking a look at the iancoleman bip39 tool: [
It's well vetted and safe. You can download it and use it offline, and of course look over the source code. It'll take your mnemonic phrase to derive your address/private keys, or you can also use it with master public keys to derive your address/pubkey combos and output to a csv file. This should allow for easy input into bitcoin core or a database if you choose.
@_date: 2019-10-30 02:12:52
Also wanted to mention as of bitcoin core version 0.17, the term *label* replaced *account*, but they offer essentially the same functionality for you to differentiate between different wallets. I once imported 200,000 addresses into bitcoin core. It took a couple hours with a php script, and then the blockchain rescan took another few hours.
Here's the php script if you're at all interested. It uses easybitcoin.php to communicate with the bitcoin rpc. If you have the public keys (I didn't), you would probably want to change importaddress to importpubkey.
    require_once('easybitcoin.php');
    $easycoin = new Bitcoin('rpc_name','rpc_password');
    $label = 'btc_adds_csv';
    $row = 1;
    if (($handle = fopen("btc_adds.csv", "r")) !== FALSE) {
        while (($data = fgetcsv($handle, 1000, ",")) !== FALSE) {
            $num = count($data);
            echo "$num fields in line $row: 
";
            $row++;
            for ($c=0; $c &lt; $num; $c++) {
                echo $data[$c] . "
";
    			$add_addr = $easycoin-&gt;importaddress($data[$c], $label, false);
    			echo $add_addr . "
";
            }
        }
        fclose($handle);
    }
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:15:40
You're not understanding my point. You said that Sycamore is 1,576,800,000 times faster than the most powerful conventional bitcoin miners. You did not say that Sycamore is 1,576,800,000 times faster than the entire bitcoin network, but your calculation is making that assumption.
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:24:35
So if I give you my bitcoin address and show you some transactions I've created in the past, you can tell me my name? I'm not particularly careful when I use bitcoin, so if what you say is accurate, it should be easy. Here's an address of mine. What's my name? 
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:49:32
It would not be hours before difficulty was adjusted. It would be adjusted as soon as the 2016th block was received. Your argument is just gobbledygook. It makes no difference about network-adjusted time being a median value. That's just used to determine whether the blocks have a valid timestamp.
@_date: 2019-10-29 05:44:43
Not sure what MPK is; it sounds like it's maybe a hierarchical deterministic type wallet, where address and private keys are generated from a mnemonic phrase. Addresses are generated in a specific order, so you wouldn't need to generate all of them, which is obviously impossible. You could generate the first 1000 or maybe 10,000 addresses for each wallet, and put those in a database. I'm not sure how many transactions you're receiving. If you need more than 10,000 addresses for each app, dumping more in your database is still very feasible. Database software can easily iterate through millions of lines if you index the columns. Regarding bitcoin versions, they don't use different chains if they're not hard forks, so versions 0.16, 0.17, 0.18 are all compatible with each other. I don't see any reason bitcoin would hardfork soon.
@_date: 2019-10-14 16:56:33
Hi. I have a web interface to my bitcoin node where you can build and broadcast raw transactions. There is an option to include data such as a hash in an OP\_RETURN output. You'll need to select your own UTXOs to use as transaction inputs, add your own transaction outputs and values to send, include the OP\_RETURN, sign the raw transaction, and then broadcast that to the network. If you're cautious about signing online you can also save the raw tx and sign offline.
\*edit - If you'd like to practice building and signing transactions with dogecoin, which has the same functionality as bitcoin, let me know and I'll send you a doge address and private key with some coins to use at the site.
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:31:27
I'm not quite following why you wouldn't want to put all your receiving addresses in a database. How else could a single node track multiple wallets? Putting them as watch only addresses into core would essentially be putting them into the core wallet db, but it would give you less flexibility. If you do end up putting them into core, you would just have to continue using an older version that still supports accounts. I use version 0.16.3 and it still has this functionality. I haven't looked into whether more recent versions still support. It's being deprecated because the accounts function is better left to system administrators using their own database software as described in my first recommendation.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:05:35
Could you throw all your receiving addresses from the various apps into a database table? One column with the address, another with the app it belongs to. Then set up a blocknotify script to iterate through each txid vout to check if any of the output addresses are listed in your db. If true, execute the app specific script associated with that address.
If you don't have any database, I think you could accomplish the same thing by importing all your addresses as watch only into the core wallet and specify an account for the address that is associated with the app. You could then use the walletnotify functionality to execute an app specific script based on the account. Note that the account functionality is being deprecated in bitcoin core, so this feature may not be available in recent or near future versions.
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:19:35
Yes. If the person sending you the bitcoin is using Coinbase to purchase, Coinbase would have their name but no information about you. They would be able to see that coins from their site were being sent to your address, but there would be no way to link your address to your name until you send those coins to some exchange that does know your name. As you become more familiar with bitcoin, you will find there are ways to use it completely anonymously if you choose.
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:39:30
That's the point I'm making. Bitcoin is literally anonymous, as in anonymous means without names. Bitcoin stores no names. Anonymous doesn't mean that someone can never be de-anonymized.
@_date: 2019-10-06 15:48:49
The answer to your first question is yes (if you're using bitcoin core).
The bitcoin-cli function *addmultisigaddress* will add create a new multisig address from existing addresses that you already have the private key for. You would obviously need to import the private keys to bitcoin core first. The arguments are the number of required signatures followed by a json array of your addresses or public keys.
`./bitcoin-cli addmultisigaddress 2 "[\"Address1\",\"Address2\"]"`
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:15:59
Also, this assumption in the article is wrong:


As others pointed out, bitcoin **BLOCKS** are mined every 10 minutes, not a single bitcoin. So your calculation should include the number of blocks remaining before the final bitcoin is mined, not the number of bitcoins remaining to mine.
@_date: 2019-06-02 00:35:07
What makes you think 17A16QmavnUfCW11DAApiJxp7ARnxN5pGX is actually the scammers address? Did they ask you to deposit coins to that address? Or are they just showing transactions from this address as evidence that they pay a return? With \~40000 bitcoins on balance and 289000 transactions I doubt this an any one person's address; probably an exchange or maybe a casino.
@_date: 2019-06-02 00:47:00
I found several sites that say this is a Poloniex exchange wallet:
@_date: 2019-06-02 01:00:03
So what is it that the screenshots show? If it's only transactions from that address, then it doesn't mean anything. It's a busy address because it belongs to Poloniex, which is a very big exchange.

Someone actually did compromise bitcoin at the protocol level way back in ancient history (2010). They exploited a flaw that allowed creation of very huge outputs without a corresponding input. This resulted in the creation of 184 billion bitcoin. The flaw needed a hardfork to fix.

@_date: 2019-12-02 21:58:11
Plenty of people find the same address if they don't use good random number generators for the private key. Brain wallets for example - if you were to use your name or an easy to remember number or word as your private key, you'll likely lose your coins.
I don't think there is any evidence of a true cryptographic collision in bitcoin, and people have been trying for years.
@_date: 2019-12-24 05:30:34
I may also plug my own site, [opreturn.net]( has this functionality. The litecoin and dogecoin sql databases are up to date, so you can find the most current ltc and doge vanity addresses, but the bitcoin parser is embarrassingly slow and is only up to 2017 at this point. It still found the 1TrymeRqXLyaSypAQqCAo6uw2vTeGiyjX address though.
@_date: 2019-12-24 06:06:30
Yeah, smartbit is pretty good, but I'm not sure if you can do case insensitive searches. The sql query LIKE 'searchstring%' isn't case sensitive, so if you've got access to a database with all the addresses you'll want to go that route.
@_date: 2019-12-14 19:28:36
A valid address would be the base58-encoded (version byte)(ripemd160 hash)(double sha256 hash 4 byte checksum).
Here's your valid address: 1JaneiHateYouxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxWcw83
@_date: 2019-12-14 05:41:21
Is it a wallet.dat file? If it might be, you should probably load up bitcoin core and put it in the data directory.
@_date: 2019-12-30 01:32:11
Miners are the ones assembling the new blocks, so they include their own address in the block to pay themselves the mining reward and transaction fees. This coinbase transaction doesn't actually need any inputs like other transactions. It only has to follow the consensus rules and payout the right mining reward and fees that are not greater than the difference between all the block inputs and outputs.
If you were able to assemble a new block that met all the consensus requirements, including a hash with a low enough number to meet the difficulty, to receive the reward you'd only have to submit it to the bitcoin network before someone beat you to it with their own block.
@_date: 2019-12-24 05:21:00

If you still have the mnemonic phrase and the address 17V7XbmxbGwigNtgnSvt8PQ4KtQsKis6vd really is yours and is derived from your mnemonic phrase don't panic, your coins are safe as long as you keep that phrase safe. Don't share it and don't put in in any random websites. As others have said, it's probably a problem with your wallet synchronization. If all else fails, you'll still be able to extract the private key and spend those coins using trusted tools such as the iancoleman bip39 tool.

I'm not sure I can help you since it sounds like you've done this successfully before. Perhaps try another wallet software? I've had good luck with coinomi, although that performs a sweep rather than an import. If you're comfortable on the console you could also try to build and sign your own transaction using the privatekey. This can also be done online at coinb.in

So it sounds like you have a valid key. It probably looks like this: KwbNA5dSnKcpGsMJA67T1eTT63m4X6R7Q1afF6Gsq7v6ruA9b7p5. You said you can see 3 receiving addresses. Have you checked whether any of them have a transaction history and whether you can dumpprivkey from any of these? You can also see receiving addresses from the console by typing *listreceivedbyaddress*
@_date: 2018-11-01 08:34:38
Does your private key look like a 64 character hexadecimal string? Do you receive a message after you enter *importprivkey PRIVATEKEYHERE* at your console or client?
Do the addresses show any transaction history at all? Perhaps the online generator took your coins?
@_date: 2018-11-01 08:22:11
Are you saying you received the code -4 message after you used importprivkey from the console? It looks more like you're trying to use dumprivkey since it's referencing an address.

The multibit classic should let you export your keys. [
Is there a chance you have multibit HD? Do you have a seed phrase?
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:59:16
Not necessarily. Different wallets use different derivation paths to convert the mnemonic phrase into private keys. I'd recommend taking a look at the iancolman-bip39 tool: [ This tools lets you convert mnemonic phrases to their corresponding private keys and can use all the common derivation paths (e.g. m/0'/0 vs m/44'/0) or use custom paths.  You can use it to discover which derivation path the original wallet used by  checking whether addresses created with the different paths have a transaction history. It's well vetted and can be used offline.
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:04:19
If you had the seed phrase it would have been much simpler. After doing a couple of searches, I think your only options might be to either find a way to install multibit hd and load your wallet to spend the coins, or get the extraction tool to work.
