No, thanks.

Ctrl+F "fake". There are fourteen instance of the word "fake" that were not said by you; all of them have the word "not" close by. *You are the only person who thinks there are fake blocks. The misunderstanding is yours.*

It is, in fact, true. The reason this does not diminish the amount of 'real' work done is that solutions to higher difficulty problems are also solutions to lower difficulty problems, i.e. a hash with 20 zeros in front also, by definition, has one 0 in front. Pools give you shares of low difficulty, and the hashes that you return are solutions to those shares; only occasionally will those solutions also be solutions to the true block.
It's not entirely clear to me why you were "almost certain" here.

Sounds good to me. TH-R1955

Right, just like they do when gold loses 50% of its value in &lt;12 hours.

Okay, I *finally* see where the misunderstanding arose. The rest of the thread was using phrases like "lowering the difficulty" in a way not consistent with the spec, because in the spec, "difficulty" refers strictly to the number in the block header. A more precise description of what pools do might be a phrase like "accepting hashes of the current block header that meet a *separate*, lower difficulty threshold as proof of work". Given a strict interpretation of the language used in this thread, your concerns are valid.
However, consider this: *everyone else* caught the abstraction being made between actual difficulty (as encoded in the block header) and 'accepted difficulty' (what the pool uses for proof of work). Clearly, you didn't, and that's not your fault, it could happen to anyone, but your response was problematic. You knew that while your understanding of hashing was correct, your understanding of pooled mining was incomplete, but rather than phrasing your replies as questions regarding pooled mining, you framed the discussion as an argument over hashing instead. This made it *much* harder to ascertain what was being miscommunicated.
Looking at all of your posts in this thread, I see no questions, despite the fact that you came into the discussion (presumably) hoping to learn about pooled mining. Instead of working to *clarify* what you understood as a false statement about work verification, you recited facts about hashing to prove that it was false, as though it was vital that you 'win' the 'argument'.
Again, you were correct that given a strict interpretation of terms, the things being said about pooled mining were false, and I don't want to take that away from you. But this could have gone much more smoothly if you had adopted the attitude of a learner, and not been quite so quick to assume that every other person in the thread was a moron.

Getting linked to Wikipedia in [this comment thread]( was apparently the first time you had heard that other currencies/commodities use dark pools. *That Wikpedia page is the first Google result for "dark pool".*
You're not being downvoted for asking a question, you're being downvoted for having apparently done *zero* background research before coming to and throwing around words like "[scam]( "[sham]( and "[delusional](

If you're buying anything that anyone would have a problem with you buying, then obviously you should be using a clean address under Tor. If you do that, though, then barring a compromise of Tor's security, I'd say you have more to worry about from one of your transaction partners being apprehended and forced to reveal information about you than you do from any network-based attack.

Why would mining individually give you an advantage? You're still hashing at the same rate, and in both individual and pooled mining, any individual hash you calculate *could* be a block solution. The only difference is that in pooled mining, you're rewarded for "near misses" (i.e. hashes that are not block solutions, but are share solutions), whereas you are not in individual mining?
The only way I can understand your objections is if you are operating under the assumption that a pool will give a miner a share such that said miner could never solve the block while working on that share. This isn't the case.
