* Their English FPGA presentation video is not good. You can't really understand much.
* Their products are quite expensive even with the exclusive prices right now. Their best hashrate is 128 MH/s and is priced the same as KnC's 250 MH/s.
* [Prospectus]( They need 4.15mil USD. The shares will raise 4.48 mil USD. Where do the extra 330k go?

@_date: 2014-03-15 01:39:43
Yes, of course. The TV campaign is still on-going (even if I don't watch TV). I am following Danny on twitter and my guess right now is that they are trying to get as much merchants as possible to accept Bitcoin before giving the public the opportunity to open accounts (How can newcomers benefit from an account if no merchants accept Bitcoin?). Not to mention the lobbying with Government Authorities. We think that Neo &amp; Bee went silent after their launch but right now they are working overtime to lay down a strong infrastructure. I won't lie. I'm anxious about it too and waiting to see the results but it will take some more time.

The first two concerns are legit. Security is paramount and we will need to work on that as Bitcoin gets more and more attention. As for the retail transactions it does sound a little problematic but I'm sure we can find something to counter that. 
The last two not so much.

Yes, there are physical limitations. That is not our concern over at ASIPs. Do you know what an ASIP and SOCs are and how they work?  We do not depend on the nanometer size of our transistors for performance so the physical limitations don't quite pose a problem.

Ask them yourself. Since everyone is mining at a loss go and ask them right now and find out.


It certainly doesn't mean a 0.01 price too. What it basically means is more shares per block for you so bigger parts of that 25 BTC reward (talking about pool mining always). 


I also don't believe that we will be seeing huge leaps in the future as we have in the past (i.e. from CPU to GPU to specialized hardware).
ASICs designed for Bitcoin are already down to 28nm. Intel is currently at 22nm. Sooner or later, the hard limitations of physics are going to reached in this area.
Just to put it in perspective, a 4nm transistor can be made out of 7 atoms. How much do you think that can be improved upon - at least in the next decade?
It's a common misconception amongst Bitcoiners it seems to me that they believe that technology will continue to develop exponentially. Not only is there no guarantee of that, but it's looking like that isn't going to be the case at all. In fact it's already been slowing down over the past few years.
Wrong. Just wrong. Making smaller transistors is not the only option for building a faster and more energy efficient miner, it's just the easiest. I believe the mining game might take a turn from ASICs to ASIPs. I am currently working on my thesis about this. ASIPs can lead the way to 80-160% of performance increase (dealing with SHA-1, SHA-256/512 algorithms) with a 10% increase in chip size. These are the results accomplished by my professor by applying a certain solving algorithm through software and hardware design on FPGAs. My job is to take that algorithm and take it to the next level on ASIPs. Technology will continue to develop.

Neo failed. The University of Nicosia has set up an account with Coinbase (i think) to accept payment for courses there. People that are not interested or won't search online believe that Neo=Bitcoin so it is a scam. Only young people (usually the ones that have hobbies or revolve around computers a lot like computer science students or gamers) know what is going on. After the negative impact Neo had I don't think there will be any further progress than that of the University of Nicosia.

There are plenty of sites that offer the same product as Gox. Neo can offer services like multi-signature accounts and an easy implementation of bitcoin transactions for merchants with the Bee payment system. Multi-signature accounts are not anything difficult to implement. They didn't start accepting deposits due to the problems that came up. As far as the Bee payment system there were 40+ different merchants signed up for that (info that came from the recent post from the employees of Neo). The only thing in beta stage was the software that would handle the exchanges, if I am not mistaken.
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:29:45
Seems that some threats were made to Danny and his family alongside with not having enough liquidity for Neo. Danny goes to UK for more investments. Now he is selling his share to raise the amount needed and giving the CEO position to who ever buys that share. If the share is bought then Neo allegedly won't have any more liquidity problems and could be operational again.

When you mention configuration files do you mean the .bat file that you run in order to start mining? Usually that file has your username and **worker password**. It will only help you if you used the same password for the actual account at the pool you registered. But seeing that you were using 50miner I guess the program takes care of the conf  files for you (no manual setup). I haven't used 50miner before but you should search their site or google for documentation on where the conf files are being stored by the 50miner program and search for them.

Allowing slower miners to get back in the game of mining. 


Also keep in mind that the first ones to go are the outdated miners. When GPU-mining became a thing the first ones to leave the party were CPU miners. How many CPUs does it take to represent a mid-range GPU in terms of hashing rate? So a whole bunch of outdated miners can leave the mining scene with only a small percentage of hashrate loss. It's not like the next day we will be at 50% of hashrate or something. The slow miners leave the scene to faster and more energy efficient miners all the time. Jeopardizing network security won't happen so easily. 
As for the blocks being mined slower we are currently mining faster than 1 block/10 minutes (1 block/8 minutes), which means faster than intended. So hashrate drops will cause blocks to be mined on the actual intended rate and not faster until the difficulty is re-calculated.

Well again that is a game of the Media. I don't understand why people have this opinion. Our bankers screw up which resulted in a bail-in. If we embrace bitcoin then banks won't have direct access to our wealth if another screw up happens (which still the people have no power over. Just corrupt people in power exploiting the people's saved money). To be honest this kind of thing happens everywhere. It happened to be in a big scale for us and got a lot of negative from the Media around the world. If we succeed with bitcoin here it will be a strong message as to what can be achieved with it and show the world what a great alternative cryptocurrencies are.

Indeed, but you cannot know for sure that this will happen. We are sitting at 131k TH/s. There is a constant increase of hashrate even though miners mine at a loss. There is still no indication of your scenario (people turning off miners, loosing security, price drop).


You make it sound that this information is only available to me. Well no random man goes on the web to read about ASIPs or SOCs, find published papers that show there is a lot of potential etc. I don't blame you.

You are missing the point here. The point is no matter what the weapon of murder was, you will still be prosecuted of contacting murder. No matter what currency you used for illicit transactions you are still breaking the law. Banning all weapons or banning currencies will not stop people from killing or breaking the law. They will just move to another way of doing it. Jared Polis was tackling all the accusations of Bitcoin being a preferable way for people to conduct illicit transactions when instead the dollar is even more widely used for those actions.

* A wallet stored in your personal computer is actually hard to hack. You must of course follow common sense when using the Internet on that PC. No visiting shady sites, no downloading of proclaimed licked/hacked files (such as the Mt.Gox user database that turned out to be a malware trying to steal bitcoin wallets) pc out of reach from unauthorized people, no sticking whatever USB you are given to that PC (you never know what kind of viruses that USB has).
* Best way to protect yourself from hacking (except the tips at point 1) is that you have your wallet at a PC that is not connected to the internet unless it needs to be (like a cold storage wallet) or at least the PC that will carry your wallet is only used for the sake of having the wallet on and sending/receiving Bitcoins on the official client.
* That is a tough question. I have no favorites and currently whatever wallet services I am using only hold BTC for brief amounts of time. For example I send the exact BTC i need to from my PC wallet to Y site wallet, perform the action I was going to perform and then if anything remains back to PC wallet. If that action can be completed using only my PC wallet then I don't use any *middle man* wallet services (this is very rare. If you are into purchases then make sure you use a wallet service with escrow so you don't get scammed or anything).
* You can encrypt your wallet with a password. In the event your wallet.dat file gets stolen they will also need the password to decrypt it (if I am not mistaken). If you are going to have a valuable wallet then look into backing up your private key and encryption password somewhere. Some store it to a USB locked in a safe. Some print those things onto metal (fire proof) or paper (obviously not fire proof).
That is all I learned from others and myself while being at reddit for about a month or two.

Replace by fee transactions. If your transaction is stuck because you had a low miner fee you basically can spend it again with a bigger fee so the previous one gets replaced. If I am not mistaken the second transaction can point to a different address that the first one.

Yeah but we want 0-conf. 0-conf is the only thing I have been using since 2011.


This is all junk. Almost zero use cases for the audience we are trying to win over other payment processors. Bump the fee? How about putting a sensible fee in the first place? Or implement a nice little fee suggestion so your transaction will have a big chance of being in the next block? Bundle multiple transactions into one? Throughout what time frame? 10 minutes or a whole day? I can see this working for online shopping for stuff that will be actually shipped to me and **require** more that one day to be prepared. For point of sale transactions I only see it as an opportunity to try to scam a seller or a seller trying to scam me as described above.


You are underestimating the POS/0-conf market.


Yeah, sure if we completely disregard 0-conf the rational and sensible sender will be fine. How many of all the senders are like that? or will be like that? You are adding more complexity. Non-tech savvy people won't use this. Are we still trying to gain mass adoption or did we completely forgot about that? If you could force all the people that use Bitcoin today to be rational and sensible senders, use RBF with the correct use-cases (0 cases or attempts for fraud) how much will the network be relieved off? Will that relief be enough in the future? Is this the solution to Bitcoins scaling? What comes next if the answer to the previous questions is no?


No they are not.


By how much? What kind of tests were completed in order to measure the positive effects of this change?
In the end all I see is suddenly 0-conf being painted as the black sheep, that it is not safe or that we need a better feature than 0-conf (not saying that you claim this but it is being used as an argument for suggesting RBF) and RBF being pushed instead of focusing on the **real** problems for scaling Bitcoin. We need bigger blocks and an incentive for people to run full nodes on protocol level. If it becomes a paying job to be a full node then you will see network efficiency being increased since I earn money by being a full node. Nodes are workers for the network just like miners. It's time to put them on equal level. This has already been implemented with positive results elsewhere. We don't even need to test this to be sure it will have a positive effect. Other people have already done that for us.

What do you mean third party? There is a protocol to be followed by masternodes. The owner of the masternode doesn't sit in front of his pc to mix coins so I don't need to trust him.

@_date: 2016-02-08 18:55:32
No you cannot loose your 1000 dash. To start a masternode you just send 1000 Dash to an address you control (there is a specific procedure). That is the proof that you hold 1000 Dash and you get a masternode private key. A masternode is just like a regular node in Bitcoin but also offers other services like instant transactions that cannot be double-spent, anonymity through Darksend (mixing of whatever amount of Dash you need to be anonymized) and voting on proposals of the DGBB (Decentralized Governance by Blockchain).
You get paid in Dash for these services you provide. Currently the reward for Masternodes is 45% of the block reward, 45% for miners and 10% for proposals (if any are active and approved).

This bothers you for what reason exactly?

The suspicious transaction is just cookies again. Admit it.
