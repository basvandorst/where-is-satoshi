New to the game here.  What is a Layer 2 solution and how does it bring down fees to help make Bitcoin usable for mainstream transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:36:07
Correct but that means transaction fees will rise to cover miners' operating costs + a profit margin.
Rising transaction fees make it unrealistic for Bitcoin to function as a currency.  Based on the article, would you pay $4 in fees to buy a coffee with Bitcoin?
Okay how about Bitcoin as a store of value?  Once all the coins are mined and everyone has the hodl mentality what then?

Well no, Gold is a store of value and can also be used as jewelery for example.
What else can Bitcoin be used for? Isn't the real value blockchain tech which can be used to solve specific problems?

I see how users can control fees by simply not doing a transaction if the fees are too high.
However, if they need to have a transaction done won't they be forced to accept paying high fees to get the transaction added to the next block?
Do the other altcoins already have a solution for this?

Aren't the blocks only able to hold about 2,500 transactions due to the block size limit?
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:53:22
Yeah, but with fees already around $25 won't they just keep rising and make Bitcoin not usable unless your buying something really expensive?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:12:03
You're probably right.  Having a bunch of empty blocks is really inefficient.  Especially when people are trying to get their legit transactions recognized on the ledger.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:07:47
Transaction volume does appear to be the answer.  However, can't we only jam 2,500 or so transactions into each block every ~15mins?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:21:54
Blockchain definitely seems like the next big leap in tech for business.
How does Bitcoin itself fit into the picture tho?  For example Kodak launching their own coin for their own use looks like it just circumvented Bitcoin.

Interesting concept.  Sounds like this solution will ultimately lead to a central hub that processes a bunch of transactions between a group of individuals.
Also, understanding how to create and use smart contracts sounds a bit too confusing at present to be mainstream.  Are there plans to make using the Lightning Network not require a PhD to fully understand?

Yep watched a ton but posting a question here already has been much more informative.
A lot if noise out there too so I'm glad you guys get straight to the point.

The question is how high do transaction fees need to be to keep miners interested without the block reward?
Doesn't high transaction fees go against the idea of Bitcoin being a fast, cheap way to transfer money?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:13:52
Very new and trying to understand the whole system better.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:48:48
This is very interesting!  Long way out based on the math.
Given that time frame, why are transaction fees so high now?  Just too many transactions happening and making a backlog?
