Slow and steady my friend ��
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:59:28
Woo I love me some discounted bitcoin ��
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:44:08
With that logic, is it really overpriced if it was $20,000 in 2017? Or $12,000 a few weeks ago?
Even though I also bought some close to 3-4k, I base my current buying decisions on recent activity. So yes, relative to recent prices of well over 10k, I’d say it’s not a bad deal. I’m definitely no expert though so buy at your own risk ��‍♂️

Then maybe it’s a problem with my account specifically. My account is also level 3 verified, but I just checked on the cash that I transferred a few days ago and it’s still on hold if I try to withdraw it using coinbase pro.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:39:44
Got some more at $9500. Buy that dip boysss
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:04:59
If you can afford it, buy more when it dips to DCA.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:34:35
Thanks dude :)
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:19:20
*[dip intensifies]*
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:58:51
Bank savings account. Next time I’ll try with another bank’s checking account to see if it’s any different.
@_date: 2019-10-01 22:28:38
Np, thanks for the tip ��
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:18:19
Wish it was faster to transfer cash to coinbase pro... price shot up from 9k to ~12k in a matter of days and I missed the dip :(
@_date: 2019-10-01 05:41:33
I created an address to send bitcoin to my Trezor. I’ve reused it a few times to transfer to it from coinbase pro. Is it bad practice to reuse that address? If so, why?
@_date: 2019-10-02 08:21:21
Well that would be ideal, but I can’t always park a bunch of money on coinbase. That’s why it’s great to have the flexibility of depositing USD and buying Bitcoin instantaneously without having to wait a week. Some people seem to be able to do this on Coinbase Pro, but for some reason I haven’t been able to. So it looks like I’ll be using Gemini for instant purchases and Coinbase Pro when I’m willing to wait.
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:43:50
Filled my limit order yesterday at $7800 and it quickly shot back up. Woo!!
@_date: 2019-10-01 22:14:19
That’s the one. I don’t see any option in the app to just add a routing/account number unfortunately :/
It seems like the only other option to avoid the Plaid login is to use wire transfers like you mentioned.
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:43:35
Coinbase pro would be the less expensive way to buy bitcoin. It does take longer to transfer cash into the coinbase pro account though. So if you don’t want to wait, then CashApp or regular Coinbase is a faster way to purchase bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:29:25
But it’s not mainly about missing out on 9k pricing per say. I’m just saying, I’d like to take advantage of lower prices when possible. The long wait times to transfer USD &gt; coinbase &gt; coinbase pro, ruin any chance of quickly responding to price fluctuations. Sure there’s faster alternatives to transferring USD or other platforms to quickly buy bitcoin from, but they usually involve higher fees and exchange rates.
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:26:09
Guess I’ll be using Gemini from now on ��
@_date: 2019-10-01 08:03:26
Thanks! That’s sort of what I gathered from what I read. So I’ll create a new address per transaction moving forward just to be safe ��
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:03:14
People said the same thing last time it was at 9k only for it to bounce back to 12k in a matter of days. Even if it does dip further, I’d just buy more to DCA. If you’re in it for the long haul, these small dips don’t matter
@_date: 2019-10-01 21:24:06
I’m always looking for the fastest/cheapest way to buy bitcoin, and I’m likely going to be using Gemini activetrader instead of Coinbase pro moving forward. 
Some people seem to be able to instantly transfer usd from coinbase to coinbase pro, but that’s not the case for me. I’m level 3 verified and even when I have existing funds on coinbase pro, I still have to wait several days for new funds to clear so that I’m able to transfer then over to coinbase pro. I contacted coinbase support and they confirmed that it takes a few days to clear.
I gave Gemini activetrader a try yesterday and I’m finally able to instantly buy bitcoin when I use bank transfer. They do another form of a hold where you are unable to withdraw bitcoin for a few days, but at least im able to lock in prices at any moment. I don’t mind waiting a few days before withdrawing to cold storage. 
 
Coinbase pro’s maker fee is still lower at .15% as opposed to .25% on Gemini activetrader, but I don’t mind the small fee difference for the convenience of being able to buy instantaneously. 
Just thought I’d let others know in case you want to buy instantly without having to pay ridiculous fees like on regular Coinbase or Cash App.
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:07:28
Thanks! Yeah I hate fees lol that’s why I’ve just been biting the bullet and waiting anyways. Let’s hope the checking account makes things faster
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:02:24
It’s not immediate to transfer from coinbase to coinbase pro. The funds stay on hold for about a week before I can transfer them.
@_date: 2019-10-02 02:23:53
So I have some bitcoin in coinbase pro and I recently transferred some usd into coinbase. I’m still unable to transfer the usd into coinbase pro because it is on hold. I’m not sure what I should be doing differently
@_date: 2019-10-01 22:00:42
Yeah, Gemini used Plaid to link fo your bank account. That’s how I have it set up and I can instantly transfer from my checking account to Gemini.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:01:25
Yeah.. I want to actually own my bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:57:56
What if I sell half?
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:24:57
Rebuy and Lambo later ��
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:13:34
9k incoming!!
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:59:49
Fair point. Must resist FOMO buying
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:14:21
Coinbase pro or cash app for lower fees, just compare them and see what’s better. With regular coinbase you’ll be paying a ton of fees
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:27:59
Right, but what if you want to time the market and constantly sell and buy? Is there no way around getting taxed every time you sell?
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:19:38
If you had 10k worth of stock from a stable top tech company, would you sell that stock to buy bitcoin right now? why or why not?
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:07:31
Bitcoin it is lol
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:31:33
I hear ya on diversifying. I'm just holding for now so I can avoid short term capital gains tax when I sell. It's actually performing very well, but I definitely don't want to have all my eggs in one basket. I already have some money in bitcoin though. You mentioned trading bitcoin, so what's the best way to trade crypto? From what I've seen it can be a tax nightmare.
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:39:58
What is the best way to trade bitcoin while avoiding a tax nightmare? From what I’ve read, it is a taxable event whenever you sell.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:00:40
I bought a Trezor from amazon for about $30 a few days ago
