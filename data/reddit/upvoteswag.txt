This is the content I come for

No. These things do not tend to favor small fish. By the time it's being pumped, you're too late to buy in, and by the time it's being dumped, you're too late to sell. Trying to time it is more akin to style of investing.

"A correction means a D/D increase of 10%"
This sub hurts me sometimes.

The people spamming would be miners - they recover the fees on txs they spam and artificially inflate network fees for everyone else. It would also be considerably more costly to spam BCH than BTC.

Investors value leverage more. Sinking cash into a home isn't always the best move.

Pretty sure the verification is different. I had to verify (again) when logging into gdax for the first time. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:39:29
No. Coinbase --&gt; gdax transfer means the coins never leave "your" wallet. If it's to someone else's account, you will have to send it to their address ie fees.

It literally only hit 8k *today*. Going lower would **be** the rebound. It's not even that small of a drop, it's a fluctuation. It happens regularly. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:06:51
I usually buy in at the top, for stocks, currency, etc, after it climb climb climbs and I assume it will keep going. Like usual, I bought in around 7300. Immediately after the coin hit my wallet it was down to 7000 and dropping. So this time, I did something different, and rode the dip all the down and increased my position anytime it dropped another ~300. I think that means I hodled(?) but I don't know if I'm using yalls fancy lingo correctly there. Ready to see where we end up.

You're phrasing sounds startlingly paranoid of uncle sam aka the boogie man

ironic ( I agree with you, though )

Sorry, my last post was a little more inflammatory than I intended. Addressing your first point: Yes, but because you don't know when you're bottomed out, it can be advantageous to utilize DCA - albeit at a likely marginalized gain. Trading risk for reward there I suppose.
 If you think you can make predictions and accurately judge how the market is going to behave, by all means do so. It was not my intention to assert that you should never go all-in so to speak, but moreso that's it's ill-advised for many less serious investors without the time and motivation to learn about what's going on relevant to them. Then again, if they're on rbitcoin, one probably already has that level of active interest and (hopefully) technical knowledge to be able to make that decision, so we can just agree to disagree on investment strategy 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:45:41
Don't try to time the market. Investing with a dollar cost averaging strategy will almost always beat someone trying to buy at bottom and sell at top.

I think he’s saying to pull the coin out, which is a good idea as I wouldn’t be surprised if coinbase tried to lock them up
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:12:54
I don't necessarily disagree with that, but it's not the sentiment I see often here, which gives me a good deal of concern. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:49:46
I don't know what kind of promises/representation they made or what's in their terms, but if they withheld users' BCH without acting in good faith/commercial standards of fair dealing and caused them to suffer losses, they'd be liable for a massive class action. IANAL.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:39:33
Yall got anymore of them tinfoil hats?
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:39:26
There wouldn’t be fraud involved here, and they have “access” but they can’t just stick their hands in your pockets without opening themselves up to significant liability. You have to authorize any debits they make. IMO, coins should always be kept off exchange once you’re able to transfer them out, unless you’re actively trading.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:32:18


Past performance is not indicative of future results. Besides, how do you know when it's found a bottom? When is the right time to sell? You don't know, you can't know. We can speculate, but timing the market is a recipe for failure more often than not, it just "feels good" to be able to control it and you can "realize" your gains earlier so you get that dopamine bump. Perhaps you have a higher risk tolerance, but I would be hard pressed to make an honest argument for market timing. 
You're right, when dealing with regular withdrawals to a wallet, you'll pay tx fees, but you don't have to anyways if you leave them in an exchange, ie Gdax and are really only interested in investing.

What about the posts whining about whining? ^/meta
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:06:20
I didn't evade your question. I ignored it, because it's irrelevant as the rest of my post outlined. **It is not irregular for the pace of growth to change. The market moves in cycles. Sometimes we take hits and sometimes we boom.** You really don't seem to know what you're talking about, so i'm not going to continue arguing with a brick wall any further.

The global GDP hasn't fallen since the financial crisis in 2009. The US might be in a rut right now, but we are not in a recession, and certainly not one impacting globally, and none of the things you posted earlier are indicators of recession. Do you watch a lot of fox news? Seems like you have a very strong "sky is falling and I can't hear you nananananana" attitude. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:23:07


Coinbase. read the OP again before making needlessly inflammatory posts. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:56:14
Yeah, my biggest issue with this sub is seeing people say "it's not a currency its a stock" or some variant like... the fuck? That statement is the most bubble-esque thing I think someone could say. "I'm investing in nothing because it's gone up so much and it's guaranteed to keep going TO THE MOOOOOOON" no it's not folks. Could it? Sure, and i'm along for the ride, but i'm also not banking my retirement on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:26:44
Miners shift to other more profitable currencies, we lose hashrate which slows down Txs, panic, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:27:28
Except that’s just [not true.](  GDP shouldn’t be growing at 10+%. It’s not sustainable growth. As economies like China and India catch up to the industrialized world, you’re not going to see the same kind of % change Y/Y. Interest rates are a function of the same 09 financial, and will likely return to “normal” over the next 2 years or so. 
You can not always go up, the market moves in cycles. Frankly I’m giving very little weight to any argument you have to make, because as I said originally, you don’t even seem to understand what a recession really is, other than “bad”
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:00:04
I don’t think you know what a recession is bud.
