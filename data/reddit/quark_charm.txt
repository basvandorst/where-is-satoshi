Quark is likely heading to healthy 3rd Market Cap - and then we will see from there - continued development - no time to argue with some scared little Bitcoin kiddies you guys are the new Gold bugs !

i'll see you chumps at $1 -
Bitcoin benefited the 30 guys that mined it the start and then the Benefited the Scam company BFL - moving forward with the scam , a few ASIC Chip makers .
Quark Benefiting 1000's of working class people across the world using information dynamics to achieve this across different demographic dynamics -
Quark was presented to people when it was 0c and no one valued it .
Bitcoin 100% centralized and can never come back from it -
Bitcoin BLF is our poster-child !
ha ha

i can prove this completley wrong the only centralized scam is Bitcoin - poor little fanboys - it went from being mined by about 30 guys to a BFL scam - Quark was a CPU only mined by 1000's then it hit 0 price basically and then the working class picked it up  - let me give you an example - and show you the power of the free market chump .
i'm going to offer everyone on the now massive Quark forum to come and offer a reply. if its all a big trick why is it 20c  - (98% ha ha fool) is held and 1000's upon 1000's have brought in - ? 
the only real scam in town is Bitcoin - about 70% is held by probably 50 people .  ASIC SCAM  plus

Hows that 13TH ASIC that is coming by KnC ha ha ! a whole 1200 of those babys being sold - thats the free market ! 
ha ha at 13k everyone can have one ! ha ha ha ha !  : D     Bitcion mined by 30 people at the start - (some shell games with BFL) &gt; then mined by 3 TH 13k miners that are released i group of 1200  ? look at that free market go ha ha !
Quark &gt; mined by 1000's of CPU . Price went to 0 &gt; picked up by working class = best disribution ever - Bitcoin wishes it had the Quark base -  Quark will make Bitcoin  look bad, probably sorry about that.
