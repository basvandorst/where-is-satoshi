the difference between bitcoin and creidt cards is that customers earn valuable rewards with their cards, and also have protection incase the merchandise or service they receive is not as expected. I would very much rather pay with credit cards than with bitcoin.

That's never happened, has it? Like I know Mt. Gox got hacked and people got their coins stolen, but it's not like they "disappeared"? Or would it be a 51% computing power kinda thing?
