Haa, I do like Exodus and wish I had read this before I just sent my bcc to Electron Cash.  At any rate, it worked perfectly and as it turns out it was in Bread (all .249 of it).  Hell, I'll take it.  I wish I had more btc at the time of the fork but looks like I just got a "free" $100+ in bcc.  Not a bad morning.  It was super fast too, like less than a minute before I could see my balance in Electron.  The only thing that didn't work was the bar code scanner in Bread, I had to paste in the address ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
Thanks to everyone who responded.

Not sure, but I Googled it and came across that Exodus added a magic button too!
So I guess my only question now is, ami right that sending it to Electron Cash would be prudent?  Or does anyone know another basic trustworthy bcc wallet for desktop or iOS?  Thanks.   Edit:  I don't think I have much, maybe .4 bcc, but hey, money is money right?

Thanks, I do recall reading that and I do NOT have Electrum installed.  So I should go for it yes? (On a Mac though..)
Edit:  but in my case, since Bread &amp; Exodus have added simplified "send all my bcc" feature, it technically wouldn't be a "sweep", I think.

Did you contact Bread support and what did they say about it?  You should make a post about it, there’s a guy on here with their support team.

Nope, you can do a transaction-free instant transfer, don’t even have to wait for the blockchain.
Think of it like moving money from your savings to checking account at the same bank.
