dafuq did I just read?
go home, bot. you drunk

just me being purely speculative. I get what you're saying now, though. It' more preparing me for myself...if that makes sense. I'm setting myself up for disappointment. 
it helps me get in the mindset that a correction will come, preventing me from going crazy and selling right now. If I expect a correction, it helps me hold on to my bitcoins and not sell them. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:16:09
just an educated guess based on previous corrections and the current state of BTC. Previous corrections have been $20-40 and I think the corrections get steeper in conjunction with the rise of BTC.
Very likely i'm entirely wrong and we get a positive correction to $500.
I HOPE SO
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:08:58
don't we all? :D
@_date: 2013-03-17 09:02:21
this is a fantastic idea. Sounds really cool. thumbs up

This is the biggest problem people don't seem to understand.
The same can be applied to bitcoin. The only reason we say gold has intrinsic value is because *we say it does*. I don't give a shit about gold - the government does. Gold is pretty shiny and cool and rare, but it only has value is because people say it does. 
The intrinsic value of bitcoin is the fact that it can be used anywhere, any time, any place, and for basically **no** transaction costs. Additionally, BTC are *also* a quantity limited item. Look [here]( As time goes on, Bitcoins will be generated at a smaller and smaller rate...eventually stopping from being generated at ~21 million.
It really can be applied similarly to gold. The only problem facing bitcoin is the amount of people that must adopt it to be regarded as a legitimate form of currency. There are two fates for bitcoin.
1) As we approach 21 million, the amount of people using bitcoin remains small. This will most certainly result in a crash because the people who have the bitcoins won't be spending them because they aren't being used as currency, they are being used as a hoarding mechanism.
2) As we approach 21 million, the amount of people using bitcoin increases with the decline in generation of bitcoins. If we have enough people using bitcoins to buy material goods at that 21 million point, the price of bitcoin will harden; it won't fluctuate as much as it does now and people will actually use it as a currency.
I certainly am hoping for the latter...it's all up to us, though.

Correct, however, I was referring to this point in the game. ASICMINER is the only trustworthy mining co IMO, and putting your money in another company is risky. 
BFL has good products, but their company is run TERRIBLY. same with many others.
@_date: 2013-04-01 06:18:33
This is incredible. way to go
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:51:14
gold. thank you!
@_date: 2013-05-18 01:55:38
hey I bought 427 shares and am concerned as to where the dividends show up. Where would I see them?
@_date: 2013-07-29 02:06:39
shiiit that sucks dude. You should email the company, that's ridiculous! I did it on my desktop and it went really smoothly.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:25:37
yeah that makes sense to me. Do you think the share price will continue to decrease as the price of BTC increases?
@_date: 2013-06-11 18:29:23
thanks for the response. essentially, this would mean that i *would* get it back eventually?
@_date: 2013-06-13 06:38:02
sketchy university. Mr. Draper, the dude who runs it, has a reputation for starting you out with the resources for a company only to have his cronies to take it over when you can't handle it yourself. He sucks your ideas from you.
no source, just what I've heard.
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:40:34
well, i took a shit yesterday and it looked like the number 130 so i would say buy it now!
everything is speculation, my friend. Don't ask people on here. No one knows - go with your gut
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:01:49
exactly the same boat as you. On my mind 24/7 haha
@_date: 2013-05-28 04:25:30
why thank you. as is yours. digging the libertarian-fast food vibe
@_date: 2013-04-22 05:22:14
hahah this is so fucked up
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:39:12
IF bitcoin *is* a bubble, wouldn't you expect the exchange rate to be what it was in 2011 before the crash?
I'd say so. We're nowhere near that value. Of course, no one is right when it comes to predicting a bubble, but I whole heartedly believe this is not a bubble.
@_date: 2013-05-18 08:52:50
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:39:58
granted, the chart is only a small piece of evidence, but it does lend to the fact that it is not...or so I'd like to think
@_date: 2013-06-16 07:36:40
this. great idea - I think it would really take off because a huuuuge target of the bitcoin market is college students. I feel like a lot of college kids are, or are getting into, bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:41:07
Ok, so what happens when I get a letter saying I owe over $15,000 in taxes and penalties?
Who's the fool then...?
@_date: 2013-05-28 02:47:32
haha i got a kick out of this. thanks
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:05:57
absolutely...that gets me thinking...What if i hold an event for redditors? Everyone who came would be interviewed...oo i like that.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:05:49
another great idea! thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:22:57
Don't really get what you're saying. All I can assume is that there will be one in the next coming days. Again, I could be totally wrong, but this is just my opinion.
@_date: 2013-07-27 07:16:36
4.4 BTC. $400 bucks
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:01:47
Absolutely! Thanks for reading!
@_date: 2013-07-11 22:23:04
Craiiiig i tried verifying and it said it did not work and I have to try again in 24 hours? What gives? 
@_date: 2013-06-15 07:53:45
good idea, but there are plenty others already working on them. Don't know if they'll be good, but if you got the funds, do it
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:10:20
yeah, but I'm saying if I want to cash out in $$$
@_date: 2013-07-11 22:26:22
thanks for the reply! My only question is why did it let me put in my information to try it in the first place? I'm just concerned maybe I entered something wrong and it got flagged - so I don't want this to happen again
@_date: 2013-07-29 02:11:08
this. did the same exact thing. I've been trying for weeks! Emailed support and they responded similarly. 
I was mad at first, but then again, I don't have any credit history. Only 19 here. Do you have bad/non-existant credit?
@_date: 2013-05-31 04:15:24
i want to shove bitcoins down this guys throat. maybe then he'll see that *writing* this article was the worst idea ever.
agreed - absolutely.no.cogent.arguments.whatsoever.
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:31:59
Yeah, just realized that no one would haha.
but i could do a webchat with various people...
@_date: 2013-06-06 03:01:18
ahh thanks for the correction. will edit
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:58:29
USA. Good call. That makes sense. If my money goes from 10K to 250K and that shows up in my account, I guarantee the gov't will be like, "ummmm" you're fucked now.
Because if I avoid taxes/gains, they'll try to sue me for more money...
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:06:20
I think you mean the Winklevii
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:45:45
Chill out dude! You should be happy more people are getting involved!
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:02:16
ehhh yeah it's long. read it though!
@_date: 2013-06-15 07:58:18
here's one: 
here's two: 
here's three: 
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:51:36
thats the plan!
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:52:32
every share is 1/100 of an actual ASIC Miner share. Just got some more so now I'm at 993 so I have 9.93 shares technically
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:17:18
you will make exactly 274 dollars
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:03:19
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:05:12
Ahhh great idea! thanks! thatd definitely give me an edge.
@_date: 2013-06-13 01:37:12
this will be the **tl;dr** of probably *every* comment you see on here....
If you buy the BFL hardware (or any other hardware for that matter), you have NO idea of when it will get shipped to you. Most of these get to people after a whole year (give or take a couple months). 
If you spend 4 grand + on equipment now, the mining difficulty will be so high that you will be mining SUCH small amounts of bitcoin per day that it will take years to pay it off. 
So...buy the bitcoins now because your opportunity cost is much safer doing so. That's what I'm doing.
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:34:09
haha I actually thought the immersion cooling containers were a good idea, too! Not sure why all the hate is spewing.
I'm long ASIC miner, I just look at Havelock (where i bought my shares) and I get :(.
I *do* have faith...it's just very limited at this point.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:43:34
doesn't mean i cant make one!
I'd focus more on regular people/ public opinion - so thatd hopefully separate it from theirs
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:15:37
If i want to transfer the money into a bank account instead of having it in cash.
@_date: 2013-05-28 02:50:04
The very moment you have a verified transaction from coinbase, and the very moment you see those coins in your account, immediately store in them on a wallet on your computer so you won't have to deal with that.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:48:04
yeah I know that's what I said
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:59:06
havelock isn't really jank. They're pretty professional 
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:12:13
What if those fresh new rigs are supplied by AsicMiner?
@_date: 2013-07-27 07:20:41
hey man no need to get upset. Gyft is a great service that enables people to buy almost anything with BTC. 
And, actually, I *did* buy an iPad mini with bitcoins. I bought an amazon gift card with bitcoins which enabled me to make the purchase.
It was still a bitcoin-paid card. Yes, I understand your frustration with the lack of purchasing options with BTC, but this offers numerous choices for my BTC. 
I spent my BTC to get an iPad Mini. Nuff said
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:30:21
haha. sad for me. 
i'm still long, though
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:01:34
Give me one example where gold *truly* has a medicinal benefit. It may help a little, but medication has much surpassed that potential.
Gold just looks pretty. that's about it. Bitcoins don't really need that value. The intrinsic value is no transaction costs, monetary freedom, and anonymity. That's a pretty friggen nice thing to have.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:41:41
definitely a good call. The smartest are the ones that hold their BTC even through rough patches. They end up being rewarded greatly.
@_date: 2013-07-27 18:27:10
because I bought some BTC a $28 and now I made a shitload. I wanted to reap some benefits without spending too much. A nice little gift for myself
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:18:19
yeahhhh this sucks haha. Probably because BTC are above $220 and everyone is freaking the FUUUUCK out. 
"GIMME BTC"
fucking get-rich-quick investors. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:03:55
really fun read. Thanks
@_date: 2013-04-01 06:16:22
exactly what I'm saying. Pretty much, I'm just elucidating a *need* for BTC to be accepted - more decentralized and more widely used. No one would put all their money in BTC now and spend only with it
@_date: 2013-06-22 09:06:22
i was like you once.....unfortunately, reddherring is correct
@_date: 2013-06-05 23:00:30
hey, thanks a bunch!
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:46:05
no problem!
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:51:33
True. Any tips to put that money elsewhere in the meantime?
