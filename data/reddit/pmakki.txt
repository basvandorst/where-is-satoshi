Everyone is so smug and smart on this Reddit. Its like nothing wrong can ever happen with bitcoin. Nothing is easy in life. You are fooling yourself and everyone else. Bring the hate.

I work 2 jobs and hardly get time to spend with my son. I know about bitcoin since a long time but we dont have enough savings to invest.  A few days ago a generous customer tipped me $100 for saving him from expensive repairs. I promptly decided to buy some bitcoin with it. 
There are people in this world who are not blessed enough to afford the good things in life. I guess we play the hand that’s dealt.  I know I can never reach for the moon with a hundred bucks but right now even 1000 feet is good for me.

These are the smart 0.5% moving cash into crypto. No guesses for where the cash comes from.

Everyone is investing in bitcoin using the “whatnif i had invested 2008” mentality. Those days are gone and never coming back. First timers should take a reality check before investing now. You will get gains but nowhere as close to what the early adopters have made.

Warren Buffett once said that as an investor it is wise to be “Fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” ... When others are fearful, it may present a good value buying opportunity. Keep in mind, the price is what you pay, and value is what you get—pay too high a price and returns are decimated.

Newcomer to the game. I always thought that bitcoin promoted anonymity but most (if not all) sites are asking for ID proof to process a sale. 
I am in a third world country where its not possible to get registered on the exchanges. What are my options to buy BTC.
