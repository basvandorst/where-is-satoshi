Well at least you don't have to take a blue pill when the bitcoin charts are looking a bit limp and flaccid.

The debt ceiling feels like arbitrary excuse for political bickering and posturing every year lately. Perhaps they should set something like a Debt to GDP % limit and not exceed that. That seems like a more useful measure of the economic health/ability to repay debt for countries.
The US was at 83.2% debt to gross GDP in 2017.  Some more extreme high-debt examples are Japan at 223.8% and Greece at 180%. On the low end, you have New Zealand at 32% and Norway at 37%)

I feel sometimes no matter how confident I am in buying the dip at XYZ price, the dips keep on getting dippier.

Absolute BS scam. Tell him you're all out of bitcoin, but if he sends you 2.5 BTC, you'll trade him a huge supply of your newly mined coin "Bitconnector".

That all sounds so real and predictable that we've somehow managed to merge reality with the Twilight Zone, The Matrix, and possibly a couple seasons of The Apprentice.

I posted this on another thread, but: I think it's funny (but maybe strategic on their part) that some big companies have spread FUD about crypto-currencies being scams and tell the public "don't waste your money".
Then what did they decide to do? Quickly open up trading desks like Goldman Sachs just did and hire people to buy up coins (conveniently while the prices are depressed from all time highs).
All in all, this is positive because it means the "big boys" are going to be putting a bunch of money into the market as a whole. I expect the market capitalization of many coins to benefit in the coming months.

Good points and thoughts. Warren Buffet certainly understood a lot of traditional companies extremely well. I wonder how it would have changed his company and the tech industry overall, had he taken risks in tech or had someone advise him to? Perhaps there'd just be more consolidation into fewer hands, like normally tends to happen anyway.

Agreed, thanks for posting.

HODL my friends. Funny to see them try to appear like experts on the subject now, though.

At least the intentions were good to clean up the forum.
