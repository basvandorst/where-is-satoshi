There is no marketing team in monero though there are some enthusiasts who started to work on its visibility. It's nothing compared to marketing efforts of many other cryptos. On another note, I think monero has a very healthy dev team and community.

It's all about the price. If BCH dumps, miners flee back to BTC. If BTC difficulty drops, miners come back.

The length is just to resolve a reorg and not a fork. Using the term "fork" for a simple reorg is completely misleading! The thing with BU/Core is that the rulesets are not mutually exclusive ie what's valid for Core will be also valid for BU but a &gt;1MB block will be valid for BU and not for Core so strange things can happen. ETH/ETC was a clean fork because both rulesets were mutually exclusive. So are Monero scheduled HFs. The network is always in a consensus with regards to ruleset to be used because all the nodes must have the same ruleset otherwise they'd be 2 different networks! The consensus on which TX came before which is achieved with PoW but that must always be within a given ruleset.

Smallest non-divisible unit is a "Satoshi". Think of it like grains of sand. The agreement is that 100000000 grains of sand will be called a "Bitcoin". Under the hood, all values are actually represented in Satoshis, and not Bitcoin.
Also, when you have one bitcoin, it's really some unspent output, which could be getting it's balance from different places of blockchain. Any Bitcoin has a transparent history and it proves the validity of the balance at the present moment.

what about this foundation? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:02:09
When the paper was made, there were 0 cryptocurrencies. The implementation of the paper made the 1st one and it was called Bitcoin. I don't think the author considered alts. I read "the longest chain" as "the longest chain of the same cryptocurrency". A node defines a cryptocurrency. Nodes with same definition can transact among each other. The whole purpose of length and POW is to determine only the chronological ordering of transactions. If someone has enough POW, he could in theory rewrite recent history by censoring out transactions, adding new ones before older ones, cancelling some transactions, re-arrange order of TX-es where possible etc. - but it still has to follow all the rules (like can't spend other people's stuff, need to have balance to spend balance and so on).
Back on topic, the 2nd one took the code, changed the rules a bit, and became known as Litecoin.
If Litecoin would get 1000x more hashrate, it wouldn't become Bitcoin or in any way affect Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:52:18
It's a pissing contest.
If there are 2 different networks it doesn't matter. Miners get to pick the version of history **within** the concensus rules. Miners can't change the rules just because they made a bigger chain under different rules. Longer chain wins only if it's alternate history of the same coin. Different rules, different coin.

It doesn't matter. Once you get XMR you're in the dark. Shapeshift can't track what you do later.


As if you have to cash out the same amount at once on the other end. For locations, you can push each monero TX using a different remote node owned by someone else.


Even if you use the same, it can still work. When yoh exit to BTC you'll be a nobody who just got some BTC. But then, you could again expose yourself if you don't care how you kove those BTC ^_^

Not many people were mining at the beginning. He had no competition to mine so he won most rewards himself. He still had to win them like everyone else.

What's that got to do with anything now? Anyway, since you've brought it up, and if you look at it objectively without emotions attached - he's not advocating making child pornography itself legal. The act of producing those pictures would still be illegal, the act depicted would still be illegal. Pictures themselves, that's another story. And I understand it's touchy because the thought of someone having those pictures is disgusting. But if you consider information to be free, then the picture itself would be free as well - disgusting as it may be. For all we know, there could be some of those pictures embedded into various blockchains. Then everyone running a node is a criminal by that same logic. What about pictures videos of actual decapitation, killings etc. They make their way to YouTube for fucks sake. Should those be illegal as well, then? The act is illegal. Filming it could be illegal. But once it's out, it's out. Making any media illegal could put innocent people at liability. Laws shouldn't be made irrationally. What if I took naked selfies as a kid for whatever reason. Maybe I thought my dick was funny and wanted to take a picture of it. Now as an adult, am I a criminal for having pictures of myself as a kid which I took alone and of my free will? Could I have accidentally put my parents in prison? Should children be banned access to cameras because of this? What if someone was collecting evidence on people who actually film that shit. He'd be guilty for possession. Nothing is as simple as it seems. Headlines like this only show how shallow people are and don't even try to understand the real issues.

And they can get payback even without copyright/patent laws.

I never said I, or anyone, is entitled. But if I somehow become aware of the information, then why can't I use it freely? The "fruits of another's labor" is not embedded in the information, it's not an intrinsic property of it. Anyone could have created it (with more or less labor) for all I know, and he has his copy. Gee, I think the guy who figured out how to control fire really had to patent it, otherwise the society wouldn't work. Same can be said for any invention up to invention of patent law. Someone should have patented the damn patent law when he invented it and use it to forbid anyone to patent anything. Just because we're taught to accept this crap, doesn't mean we shouldn't question it, and eventually disassemble.

Crowdfunding, advertising, live events, collectable physical releases (hell, blockchain could help there to prevent forgery). You need to get creative.

Those feeding of the current system will be the first ones to tell you that YOU need copyright, while it's really THEY who need it, and the consumer really doesn't benefit from it. Why should anyone care about how parasitic structures make money? How is it public interest that information can be protected or have "rights"?

It... wouldn't? So what. Maybe people would start to crowdfund movies and authors they want to watch instead of being served expensive Hollywood crap. It's the only industry where you do the job once, and get paid N times for it. A physical part needs to be produced N times to be sold N times. A piece of information is produced 1 time and sold N times. How in hell does that make sense? It's not scarce. Information is free.
The only legitimate way to protect information it is to keep it secret - as you do with your private keys. Corps can do that with IP and have a head-start in production and creating a brand. At the end - why would we - the consumers, care? Let's abolish the Copyright/Patent laws and see how it works out. I'm sure they'll find a way to make money. Nothing can stop progress, and in fact I believe those laws are throttling progress. Imagine if all the creative people in the world would be free to mess with whatever tech they want! What a world! Rent seekers need patent laws, big people who push the frontier do it just for the sake of having it done.


I believe that some decades from now, having them will be seen as dumb remnant of the past, and open-source culture will be thought as most important "invention" in human history.

If you get Bitcoin at an exchange, it will break your anonymity regardless of Bitcoin's traceability properties.
If you have an untraceable cryptocurrency, you get **privacy** since the exchange won't be able to tell what you do with it.

I see what you did there:)

Tax visible, immovable assets - not money itself. Money should really be free. And Bitcoin transactions are not really anonymous. Anyone can look-up a balance of some address and track where it goes and do some analysis on that.
I see tax as [forced] subscription to services of the govt. Now it's being stolen from the people. It should really be opt-in, but then: no pay, no service.

No source, I was exaggerating. Anyways, here's a nice chart:  
Has socialism ever really worked in any country before? We're entering a new age, and with it will come new ways to solve problems. Freedom to the individual.

Unless you have a robo-enforcer coercing people into obedience to the smart contract, you got nothing

There are the fees, but it's yet to be seen how that works out:

3 . see Monero example for argument pro-HF. Already done a couple HFs as a clean protocol upgrade (actually scheduled loosely every 6 months) - if all are on-board, it's seamless.

It's not the end until something actually happens with the protocol, whatever it should be.

For me, using Mycelium in 2014 was my moment of "oh boy, this rocks"

Sure, but vested interests in the current system won't allow for peaceful migration to something better. It's just the world we live in. At the end, civil disobedience may be the only way.

As it should be. Miners should really be thought of as subcontractors to enforce the only protocol rule nodes alone can't: chronological ordering of transactions. That's all miners really do - have the ultimate say in what came first.

Yes, and it's like 1% of the budget. Give people back the 99%, and they'll easily have funds to crowdfund whatever they want in their local environment.

Why do these people make laws/regulations nobody asked them to make. I'm an EU citizen who doesn't want this regulation and thinks all voluntary transactions should be entirely free from law, where's my voice in this?
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:33:46
V is for voluntary. As if the model "we steal from you and decide what to do with it" is the only one possible. How about "I voluntarily donate to community projects that I find important"? If I could choose where my taxes go, a big deal of bureaucrats and parasites would find themselves on the street quickly. On the other hand, teachers and doctors would probably find themselves in a better position.

Same way it didn't destroy ETH/ETC


Bitcoin was never fungible to begin with. Anyways, let's say it was. After the split, both new coins would be fungible - as are any 2 independent currencies. Your value just got split into 2 stores. Pick one or use both.


Nah, the event will just be added to "Bitcoin obituaries". Regardless, don't trust anything. Diversify and adjust risk.


It can not fork at "any time". This drama has been going on for years now and it still hasn't forked. And so what if there's a possibility. At the end "the masses" don't really want the responsibility for anything so they might as well keep their Bitcoins at Coinbase or something who will make the decision for them.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:59:14
Don't *they* also need places to hide?
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:52:03
If people ever want to be free, then the mentality needs to change from "someone will do it" to "nobody is doing this, maybe I should"
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:27:27
Ok, did I give them permission to spend my tax money on this? Point is, these people are supposed to be delegates of **us**, but they keep doing things against our interests.
