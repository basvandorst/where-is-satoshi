A lot of people are suspicious that this was a real theft, but unfortunately it shows why Bitcoin isn't quite ready yet. There is too much power ceded to hackers when there is no way to reverse transactions. This is why it is too difficult the way things are to build a business on top of a trustless system. If there was a mechanism for reversing transactions then scammers wouldn't be able to lord it over everyone else when they cover their tracks. If there isn't a mechanism for reversing transactions then biometric signing would be what you would want to look at to restore confidence to this tech.

My basic test for a scaling solution is this. I keep a hot wallet with blockchain.info, and that address is public. If someone sends BTC there, I want to be able to bounce a coin from there back to my server computer running Bitcoin core. I won't be updating my computer platform or the Bitcoin wallet, so if it isn't accepted by that machine the fork is illegitimate

If my Bitcoin Core client at version 0.11.0 rejects an incoming transaction from a new 'Bitcoin', whereas blockchain.info can update their wallet, I will not as an integrity test

So my 5S stores a fingerprint for auth, also a server could theoretically store the same identification data and authorise a payment on my behalf in the future?

Personally I don't like handling cash, and it makes me feel unclean touching and using it. Modern plastic bills aren't as bad as older kinds, but coins and such are a pain. A cashless society can be a scary prospect, but if it is powered by Bitcoin or other crypto currencies and you hold the keys to your own wealth, it's preferable

I've been thinking about this as well, this is how I understand it. If you receive 'income' in federal fiat notes, then the government reserves the right to tax a percentage of the thing they issue. If you keep funds in Bitcoin, then the government does not share the risk, and they are not entitled to their share. Once you convert it to AUD, then you're in their backyard again. If you pay an employee in Bitcoin, then this is a new form of barter. How much 'income' comes from this depends on how much is converted to fiat. So you should be able to scale your income however you like, once you assume the ongoing risk of keeping funds in Bitcoin.

I think there are only two possibilities here, either Cryptsy has been dishonest with their internal book keeping, OR, they have had an amount of their funds frozen as a result of pressure from US authorities. Pretty sure Cryptsy is still the biggest altcoin exchange so it could be that pressure from US authorities is being applied to discredit crypto currencies in general, or more specifically, the diversification thereof. In terms of what you can do, it's better to wait than throw money down a legal hole.
