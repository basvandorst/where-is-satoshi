There is already a reward system in place, with which you gather some points instead of coins which you later use to get to better universities or classes. At least in Europe, several countries have this.

Good luck to you Sir I honestly don't know since where I come from schools aren't privately owned so there  are probably different rules in place.

Yes but not money. You can't use it for bread outside campus. Is it not money but monopoly money. You can give students whatever you want but you can't pay them *money* for good work

the politicians nature is to do what the public likes at that particular moment, it doesn't matter whether it's good for the public or not. the only question the politicians asks of them and their team is, will this help me in the next elections?
we've gone from society that does what it needs to society that does what it wants, and the public wants reality shows, justin biebers and lots of twitter.

It's only brilliant if you own a bank or two.

This will get shut down as soon as someone important sees it. I don't think you can pay kids for their work at school but what do I know.

Well yes, the process brilliantly exploits the people. This is the part they don't tell you, yes it's brilliant (to exploit the people).
But *today* we know most people are being exploited in one way or another, and knowingly sitting idly is just as bad.

Can you repeat the question?

We have an arrest order for you sir, please wait until the officers arrive.

Yeah and companies will in no way move their headquarters or data centers to countries where this is not the law.
The only thing here, the UK will lose money over this on the long term.
You can't stop progress, it's simple as that.

ah yes, this is what i was looking for. i also found a ATM near by where I can buy them directly for cash at a bit lowered price, but still.
Ok cool.
