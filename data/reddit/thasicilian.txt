Can you eli5, still learning the terminology

Can somebody explain what these fees mean when transferring from gdax to a ledger or wherever else? I sent 0.0001 to my new ledger to make sure it works before I send the rest. Is there a chance it doesn’t go through?

On YouTube if you type ledger Nano S you’ll see a couple good videos explaining how they work and how to use them. Thats the way to go.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:17:02
Correct. And when you do transfer it only send a tiny bit at first to verify it works. And before you do that I’d reset your device with the 24 words to make sure those are correct. Good to be safe.

You forgot periods in between each word, that’s a classic

There is a weekly limit on bank transfers. If you wanted to buy more than that limit would you do a wire?

I bought some bitcoin like two weeks ago on Coinbase and it still says pending, which is fine because I seen people here say it takes a while, but the date says dec 3. Still shows the price I bought it at though. Anybody have the same issue?

today’s ath is tomorrow’s dip :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:28:45
From gdax to ledger
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:27:34
Not sure but it’s over 10
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:48:54
I would imagine there’s a bank of words and the ledger or whatever just gives you random words, since it’s offline. Complete guess tho.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:45:51
If you do a market buy/sell is there fees? Or is a limit the only way to get no fees? Still kinda confused about that 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:51:25
God damn my credit union for refusing to wire to any crypto exchange. Hopefully it dips tomorrow lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:26:21
Gotcha, thanks
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:41
It seems that way right? But nobody knows anything. All we do know is on the 10th there will probably be something happening lol. I wouldn’t keep waiting for it to dip, if it were me I’d get some now and hope for a dip around that futures stuff. I’m new to this but just my thoughts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:32:07
No I just checked it doesn’t 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:12:19
Fuck outta here

Hey guys, I have a question about gdax and Coinbase. So it seems if I wanted to make a purchase right this minute I’d have to use Coinbase and accept the fees, right? Because sending money from my bank to the USD wallet on Coinbase (which is what gdax uses I think) takes like a week. Feels like I’m missing something. Thanks for any replies.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:57:52
Buy now. Next week this price will be the dip (maybe).  Coinbase is cool but familiarize yourself with gdax for no transaction fees. There’s a bunch of posts on here about it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:00
Can you help me understand limit orders a bit? So you can only do it on gdax and with the funds ready in your usd wallet correct? And just set a limit to buy if it hits a certain price?
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:44:22
Are people moving their btc from cold storage to exchanges for the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:09:09
I’m pretty sure wires are same day if you get it in before 1pm pst
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:30:37
What they said. Also, before you transfer any bitcoin to the ledger do a reset with the 24 words just to make sure. What I did was transfer 0.0001 from gdax to the ledger (took overnight to get in there) and then reset it with the pass phrase. Just be extra diligent when moving money around. When you copy and paste the address to send it to, don’t just trust that it’s correct, double check. I just did all this yesterday, people around here are great. Good luck.

If your bank account is linked you can wire funds to gdax and it’ll be available a couple hours later if done before 1pm PST
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:10:42
Go to the bank and wire it to gdax, funds should be available a few hours later if done before 1pm PST
