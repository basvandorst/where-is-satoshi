A short is a type of option that has a time limit, and you have to pay a price in order to build a short position. Really, this has less to do with the platform and more to do with whoever they are using for margin. It's worth mentioning that most options never get executed, so the fact that someone actually bought 44 million dollars worth a bit coins, IE it was executed, is really bad news for whoever held that short position. I'm sure multiple people lost their jobs.

You've got it backwards.  Burden of proof is on the person making the original claim, in this case that "banks can't apply negative interest rates to cash."

People distrust bankers, but they have a long way to go before they start distrusting money. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 01:21:05
Exactly. 
Price =/= value, and you're trying to buy value.  If the current price is higher than the future value of a stock, you sell it no matter how much you bought it for.  
A dumpster fire burning $100 dollar bills is worth the same as a dumpster fire burning trash.  Might as well sell if you can if the value won't go back up.

No, it implies there *are* Bitcoin manipulators...that's why they're peeing on the Bitcoin users...

Seems legit.

Not how that works
@_date: 2019-02-09 05:35:40


Couple points: first, there won't be a sudden rapture of people changing from dollars to bitcoin.  Nobody will be confused by prices, and exchanges will exist as long dollars possess any value.  
Second, the wild price fluctuations of Bitcoin are terribly counterproductive.  If Bitcoin produce wealth on its own (I.e., becomes deflationary) people won't want to use it as a currency at all.

You answered your own question
@_date: 2019-02-09 13:24:08


You're describing quite a catastrophe. It's probably fair to say nobody knows what would happen in a situation like that.


It may not be ideal, but if you look outside there are billions of people with jobs, food and housing.  Not exactly on the verge of collapse, and not exactly a failure.
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:36:23
Bitcoin as a form of insurance isn't necessarily a bad idea, particularly if you are insuring against fiat currencies in general.  But I'd be wary of anyone claiming to know the future, and fiat currency has been around for a long, long time.  Even if the doomsayers are right, they may not be right in your lifetime or even the lifetime of your children), and the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent, as they say.

Its only viable option is as a currency.  It has no inherent value and is nothing more than bits and bytes, which will ultimately be worth 0.  All other stores of value have intrinsic value.
But coin is a fad on par with Beanie Babies.
