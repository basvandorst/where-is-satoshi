the OP was talking about the company operating efficiently, making steady profits over time through standard business practices rather than trying to steal its clients bitcoin as Mt. Gox did. Not the USD price of bitcoin.

I have been trying *so* hard to do this. Unfortunately, living in Alaska has its drawbacks. Namely, no free shipping and in many cases no shipping at all through Overstock, Newegg, and TigerDirect. That's one major area where Amazon shines. They have their shipping game locked down.
That being said, I have made purchases from all three with BTC, I just have to be extremely selective about what those purchases are and whether it's wirth the extra fee to pay with BTC.

This would kind of upset me, but in a really good way, since I just overpaid a bit to buy the parts for my first rig on Overstock today.

Its not a terrible one, but it's a little overpriced compared to what I could have paid by shopping around and payong fiat. But it was a good excuse to support bitcoin and finally pull the trigger on buying the stuff I've been hemming and hawing about. If I remember I'll try to post the parts after work tonight.

I can't tell what's a joke anymore. I have no opinion on the matters at hand and have deleted my comments because they did not contribute to the discussion and I don't want to get in the way of the serious business being discussed.

Oh god. You guys. I got so drunk last night and spent like 300 mBTC on shit I don't have any use for. I bought a tent, and I've only been camping once. I bought a two pairs of these motherfuckers  and then got really excited and bought 5 more as gifts. Who the fuck wouldn't want those?? I also bought a $50 PSN card, a walter white poster that I have no intention of putting on my wall, and 3 pounds of honey.
Damn it feels good to be a BTC gangster.

My Wii fails as a game console, because I now use it exclusively as a Netflix machine. It still serves the purpose *I* want it to, though.
