But fiat currency has different prices because it's different things, and some countries print more/less.  My original question stands.

Is bitcoin copyrighted? If so by who? Why can't people just make the exact same thing?

Cool, but arn't all fiat currencies basically monopoly money. They're only worth somthing because people believe they're worth something.

So bitcoin isn't really unique or limited?

Thanks makes more sense now, still seems like crypto is not that rare if you can continually make other cryptos. If there was only bitcoin, it was worth so much but every time a new currency is started doesn't that dilute the scarcity value. And it seems like they can make as many alt cryptos as they want. There's 21000000 of bitcoin, but theres another 21000000 of bitcoin2 and another 21000000 of bitcoin 3 and so on.

So can make something that is virtually the same, with a different name? So why isn't that printing money?

That makes sense. But it still seems like all the different alt coins are similar to all the different fiat currencies. Some alt coins have superior systems to bitcoin and some don't, but they are all just a representation of worth while being effectively worthess in and of themselves.
