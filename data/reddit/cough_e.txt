OK, you're 5 and living in your parents' house. Your parents keep you safe and give you certain benefits, which is nice. (They are like a mini government). But you need to keep up your end of the deal, so you do chores. To keep track of chores, your parents give you a sticker every time you do a chore. It's a worthless sticker, but it has the value of 1 chore.
To keep things moving along, you need to give your parents back 5 stickers every week. This ensures that the cycle is running continuously and chores are getting done each week.
So let's now say that you did 8 chores this week and have 3 extra stickers. Stickers have no inherent worth, but they have value in this house. If your brother didn't do his chores this week, maybe you trade him a sticker for a candy bar. So you can now see that the worthless stickers created by the parents can be bought and sold among the kids and retain true value.
Now how does this analogy fit with real life? Obviously the parents are the government and they create dollars (stickers) to distribute to the citizens (through banks). The 5 stickers per week is equivalent to taxes. Each year you need to pay your taxes to the government, and they only accept dollars. But you can't have any dollars unless the government gives them out first, right? So the government needs to give out tax liabilities in the form of dollars. 
Simply put, the government gives out tax credits and expects some amount back in the future. In the mean time, these tax credits are bought, sold, and traded among people for various goods and services - which results in economic growth.
