Hi Jeff,
I've been playing around with rushwallet's code and found that I've been occasionally able to get the "?z=xxxxx" url additions when using the QR reader for Android. At least that's my recollection... Perhaps that's where it came from.

No, not like X11. The difference is that Myriad has basically 5 different chains with different algos going at the same time, but distributing the coins between them.

The profit in the chip industry is in volumes. If the upfront cost of design and layout (both in labor and time) is large and the threat of algo change (which can happen quite quickly if there is consensus) is real, the business case might not look so good...

key word is **centralized**
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:27:16
correct, I don't see a way that doesn't require at least one fork.

actually, with a multi-algo solution ([Myriad]( you can keep SHA miners.
Interestingly Myriad was able to use mining consensus to replace a mining algorithm (and it's misbehaving miners) in August.
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:32:19
5x the money, ideally. Hopefully what Myriad has been able to prove is that multi-algo works and there is no real limit to the number of concurrent chains.

How do we know what Coinomi is doing? Where is your source code to prove this?
@_date: 2019-08-31 18:18:22
What good is checking code that is no longer being used supposed to solve?
@_date: 2019-08-31 14:27:01
Maybe if your wallet was open source we might actually be able to independently audit its behavior. Open source wallets are mandatory for proper key management.
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:19:06
I don't see a technical question anywhere. Why don't you try asking a specific technical question?
@_date: 2019-12-03 14:48:16
Why would users need their coins "back on-chain"? I think maybe you misunderstand the "N" in LN.
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:04:14
I did, however I'm not convinced you actually understand LN and it's relation to the "first layer". I think perhaps you're just concern trolling.

I can't speak for everyone, but ThomasV contacted me for approval for my tiny contribution... I would assume the same for everyone, or a rewrite for those who didn't agree.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:25:48
The issue (at least my issue) is that key management is of concern. If you can't audit the complete source of everything in memory what's the point?
I suspect in time MS may eventually use the linux kernel, but I would be absolutely surprised if the entire OS stack is open-source.
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:38:07
Not only that, but sharing an xpub plus a single leaked private key will expose the entire xpriv, yes? My impression was that it's better to keep your xpub as confidential as possible. Perhaps a tool like this would be better if open-sourced to run offline or on your own hardware.
@_date: 2018-11-30 01:53:59


Agreed... I've always been paranoid that schemes like this are used to capture xpubs, then get the user to think that a single used or unused private key is OK to share as well. Bad idea obviously.

FWIW, I believe rushwallet's brainwallet is the same as bitaddress.org (and brainwallet.org for that matter). Meaning you can take that random rushwallet brainwallet and bitaddress.org can decode it...
@_date: 2019-09-02 02:38:34
Bullshit unless we can audit the source code.
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:36:53
I like rushwallet for random brainwallets:
Memorize the randomly generated brainwallet created and it's as simple as plugging it in to:
and you're all set to spend.
Of course, if you don't think you need to use some form of entropy, please read the precaution here:

Not saying that there's anything wrong with triple integration, just that the outside integral looks extraneous.
Also note the convenient use of white-space around the head.
@_date: 2016-05-06 15:04:38
Nice use of the triple integral, for when the double just isn't getting the job done...
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:19:02
Or maybe they're both scams, one more than the other
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:24:45
alternatively, ETC is the real ETC and ETH is the bastard chain that alters history thus isn't a crypto, just a distributed database
kind of funny how perspective can be different I guess
