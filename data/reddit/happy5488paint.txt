Plan B = run BU.  If you can't beat them, join them.

We have been waiting years.  Thank you core for being swift, simple and efficient in your decisions on simple engineering solutions that improve the network and exist today.  /S

Is that allowed her?  Expanding on such thoughts here can be dangerous.

This is ridiculous.  Bitcoin gives users the opportunity to run a full node and hardly any other system even has anything close to this property.  Major breakthrough.  You sir theymos seem to be obsessively forcing users to compulsively use this node running feature.  You can't force users to run nodes, only allow the system to handle more users and grow so that nodes will naturally be started as network grows.

Or find a better implementation

I think bitcoin could have increased blocksize years ago.  Now we have segwit as candidate.  Seems like we could hard fork this with blocksize limit increases.  Keep this thing moving forward, not sideways.

Thanks for the interest!

Bitcoin can scale now

So you are telling me two things.  
1.  It is not dangerous
2.  I am a troll
Without even making my argument you are already calling me a troll.  I don't think that is a nice thing to say.  Troll is not a nice or constructive term.  
Seems like a danger zone to me.
@_date: 2016-11-06 20:01:13
Yes.  
The reasonable next step is to remove the hardcoded blocksize limit and allow the size to increase to allow the network to grow in regards to on chain bitcoin transactions. This allows the community to innovate and evolve on this decision, allowing new bitcoin users to use the network, more active transacting amongst existing users, and new use cases which take advantage of the existence of a higher volume of on chain transactions available.
Even with this exciting increase, lightning research can continue at the break neck pace it has been progressing up to this point.  
The community does not need to split, it can actually work together hand in hand in this scenario.
The current segwit implementation strategy is a poor engineering decision.  The community may vote to not use it.  Time and logic and voting will tell.  Thankfully freedom of speech and freedom of code exist.

Perhaps there is no point in keeping RBF.  It is silly to double spend a bitcoin, even if it is not confirmed yet.  Considering that the astonishing issue that bitcoin solves is a way to prevent double spending transactions, now we have a 'feature' that allows a user to double spend a transaction.  We have been able to double spend transactions for decades, ever copy a file and send it to two people?  This RBF is not a feature, it introduces a flaw in the first ten minutes of neteork behavior until the confirmation actually takes place.

A:. Terrible question.  Think about the definition of intrinsic and the definition of maintain.  Value that is intrinsic by definition does not need to be maintained.  
B.  See A.   TERRIBLE QUESTION.  
C.  WHY oh why is there a price to block space.  For periods of time it was free.  And this was great for the community.  Free can be good!    You have this twisted.  Just because something is expensive does NOT mean it is valuable.  Likewise the best things (and most valuable) things in life are free. 
Blockspace price should not be centrally controlled.  It is a means to an end, to provide the function of a peer to peer cash system.   Ut is a transaction network, and we want more effing transactions.  Can we drop the mic on this and increase now???
@_date: 2016-10-25 21:12:36
I vote upgrade blocksize higher.  Thanks!
@_date: 2016-10-28 01:23:40
I don't really like the concept of RBF in general.  Seems to me the focus should be on faster confirmation times and reliable transactions.  Perhaps RBF could be rethought.  Perhaps we could remove RBF.

Love it.  Raise the limit.
