Sorry was basing my knowledge on when I looked into mining last year. Good to know they now take funny money lol
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:50:26

No. If I fail in crypto I don't get a bank bail out :)
Banks take insane risks because the fed will bail them out at the cost of inflation to the rest using USD. As we saw with TARP bailout from bama

Depends how much ver invested into the attack
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:05:53
Allow the clowns of bcash to make their network attacks more affordable by short selling during their attack and dumping during any recovery 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:15:43
Precisely why there is no excuse for going down. They charge more than enough fees for all the bandwidth, servers, and/or tech devs to prevent this from ever happening if it was a priority.
(Unlike segwit.....?) 
Bcash seems more of a profit priority sadly 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:43:33
LN and atomic swaps of virtual monies is not modern enough for you?

@_date: 2017-12-13 18:46:10
I'm sure a priority of their customers is being usable even in wild price fluctuations instead of having "hardware failure" every occasion. 
Sounds much more like a not publicly announced circuit breaker, like in the futures market, to mitigate cost risk.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:22:54

You cant think of a decentralized way to publish evidence of insider trading, with a crowd funded bounty perhaps? 
Just because the government doesn't/can't yet understand bitcoin in depth doesn't mean we need to rely on them alone to hold the guilty thieves responsible.

Backlogged because ver and associates are spamming the legitimate blockchain with corrupt txs
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:50:14
Suggesting such a large price increase would also suggest a larger market cap/adoption so hopefully exchanges won't be needed and you can spend the BTC for anything you'd need :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:25:43
Luckily the people who invest in crytops are usually smart enough to see the blatant market manipulation/attacks by roger ver and his shitcoin minions.

Been hanging on, will continue to hang on till the next halvening at least :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:04:35
The transactions don't necessarily need to go through from my limited understanding but sure it would cost money. But when your coin will be doubling in value due to insider knowledge I an sure some ate ending up positive in the end
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:26:31
I'm holding till the next halvening at least, don't really care much about these day to day occurrences. Well see what happens I guess

@_date: 2017-12-05 02:11:05
I've diversified in about 4 different coins. Litecoin and a few xmr, but the lionshare is still in btc. It will indeed play out either direction, but if we can look at the trend I only see it increasing imo. Maybe not explosive but sub 9k coins won't happen again unless something catastrophic occurs.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:07:40
Its btc with ltc side chain or death at this point.... Ugh
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:02:44

Didnt have enough money to start a Roth IRA before bitcoin sadly. Now I see no reason why to work backwards especially with people starting to buy houses or cars with BTC.
If bitcoin shoots to the moon or the dollar loses value the Roth IRA will seem like a poor investment. Minus either scenario happening it does seem like the best investment for secured returns.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:57:15
Put btc on a physical card or Samsung pay etc. Not a huge leap in technology for the end user if implemented in similar ways as payment methods we use now. Just hasn't been done yet
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:12:47
Bitcoin is successful not because of any socio-anarchy motives but because its an effective store of value.
If you are trading gold for bitcoin I recommend doing it in person and inside of a bank and/or with an attorney present.
No one can tell you if BTC will go up or down. Your gold will probably stay ahead of inflation regardless. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:18:14

Amazing Elizabeth, please deploy this asap and save us from bitcoin judas
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:54:37
I think it was fraud, they listed bcc at 8k then it dropped and froze buy/sells.
With no prior listing announcements like a regular exchange would do.....
Executives in coinbase belong in jail along with Roger ver who bribed them into listing his shitcoin. If not in jail at least publicly ousted as a corrupt institution and named as criminal scumbags that they are.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:54:38
I like having money that can't be seized for arbitrary reasons, nor will I pay taxes on any coin profit.
The fruits of my labor and mind are mine to keep and distribute as I wish, would rather see it rot then stolen from me at gun point.
I support feeding the poor, I support roads and affordable healthcare. Just because we are stuck in this system does not mean I need to participate in financing wars overseas and financial "military" aid to foreign country.
FIAT money is inflating because the country has been in debt for failed social programs and BAILING OUT BANKS.

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:27:56
And then coinbase gives all your information to the IRS in 2 years 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:28:57
Very true for main coins! Wish there was an easy option for xmr in my ledger.....
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:10:48
I shouldn't have to and would prefer to trade it for goods or services instead of paper tbh
If I hypothetically held any substantial coin
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:24:39
That's fine, you can still send certified mail from an attorney to the virtual office.
The letter will have the attorney's letterhead and demand either proof of fraud or the return of funds in a timely manner or else face legal action.
If you need any more advice feel free to pm me. I've had to do something similar unfortunately....

The left wing perspective relies on taxation to fund their social programs, "regulations", and their own salary.
It is counter intuitive for any politician to support bitcoin because it will make their blanket theft much harder.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:18:16
Wrong. Paypal/venmo have stolen money out of hundreds of users account with no cited issue except breaking TOS vaguely, then send an email saying we take your money and no longer wish to have contact with you.
Crypto horror stories are from mostly clueless people who didn't do research, not a central authority randomly stealing from them
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:11:52
I don't doubt scaling has its difficulty, but with the amount of volume and fees they collect this should be mitigated as much as possible to instill trust in my institution and a level playing field. 
Instead they opted to do a short term cash grab.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:20:40
Been saying this for roughly all of 2018 it seems...
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:46:12

@_date: 2018-05-22 08:17:49
Because venmo is a piece of shit thievibg company owned by old money status quo paypal.
They can seize your money at will and do not allow ANY commercial transactions (will even reverse charges paid if buyer calls and complains).
They have stolen ~1k from me after it was in my account and provided no reason and then give me a generic email response informing me: they will cease communication and I violated TOS. That's it, closed my account and stole from me. Won't respond to emails. Fuckin thieves
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:03:44

No it cannot be "hacked" because there are no servers. 
It can be manipulated via bogus tx (as we've seen last week) or other means, but the decentralized nature of bitcoin makes attacks costly and unsustainable over the long term.
With that being said I'd be more worried about keeping my private key secure and not having any typos

Legally the government entitles itself to a share of anything you produce whether from your sweat or your mind.

You are stolen from for the good of the country? Do you really believe that ? I'm curious what you think the government can do that a private company couldnt.

Sounds like the venmo of bitcoin.
That fucking sucks that they essentially stole from you, but since its bitcoin if you don't have the private key you can't do much. Funny instead of rejecting transaction they let it go through and then stole from you.
Did they cite a reason to you? 
That's enough money I'd pay an attorney to draft a letter to their headquarters demanding release of funds or face civil and criminal repercussion.

Yes, the truth can be harsh sometimes.

No. I am an individual who recognizes the government has no right to steal income via taxation. 
You clearly make your livelihood by assisting to interpret their esoteric laws, that by some leap of logic, entitle others to my bitcoin gains.

Your colleague is correct, bitcoin (currency) is the first practical application of blockchain technology. They are not interchangeable terms if that's what you were getting at.....

Its live for maybe 6 people in the country...funny part is the admin of their twitter is telling people to send him .5 ETH for a chance to win 1500 eth lmfao

Oh wow I'm new to twitters. Was obviously a scam but looked pretty convincing at first glance
@_date: 2018-03-23 07:30:56
Such a shame I lost all my coin to scams ��
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:45:20
Yep, noticed that thx. Pretty convincing at first glance

Paypal owns eBay so I imagine we'd see btc in PayPal services before eBay merchant services. Not to mention a conflict of interest....

Robinhood aka competition woke them the fuck up pretty quick eh?
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:54:20
Could be a ploy to get new users, robinhood may never even allow crypto trading in practice. Whats taking them so long anyway....
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:32:00
You're welcome! Opportunity cost my friend :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:01:51
Whenever the next havening is about to happen.
Its like dividends for crypto haha
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:25:37
Fuck you, I don't need you or anyone else siphoning the fruit of my labor. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:39:18
Sounds completely fair. To act otherwise without consent is theft.
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:41:15
Sucks that the western intelligence agencies destabilize countries by helping instill dictators or the inverse arm "rebels"
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:47:17
I agree with you, chemical weapons are evil creations of humanity!
However I don't think the true solution is to bombard an area with (a lot of) conventional weaponry instead. And this is assuming the rushed narrative is completely true��
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:56:22
Seems logical if you hold more crypto than fiat.
But also seems like an ocd compulsion if hodling for long term regardless....
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:41:59
As long as you don't sell crypto its not a taxable event AFAIK
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:38:16
The elite are good at secrecy. I could only guess at a few various motives but to distract from opposition criticism, consolidate power, and/or profiting from this endeavor.
We will find out with time probably when good people find the courage to speak out or a whistleblower tells the truth.

Puerto Rico sounds wonderful
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:06:51
I don't know what you think "swing trading" even means....if it makes you feel better just give the IRS the whopping $10 so they can build more roads
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:37:15
I love how you only need 2 Buddy's and all of a sudden you're a coalition!
If civilian lives were a concern we would be raiding the concentration camps in north Korea.
Instead history repeats itself and people forget every war we have fought in has had an ulterior motive��
