Ohh I need to buy extra hardware.  And what kind of payoff is it.  Like pennies at a time or fractions?

so basically the system regulates itself, by adjusting difficulty, this way one person does not reap all the benefits.  So a miners job is to basically do all the leg work, to keep everything on the level and they get a real small piece of the pie, which is divided up between the pool. Transactions get verified and remain anonymous because they are constantly being "solved" by miners.  (Stop me if I don't get it.)  So i spend hours on my computer pushing it as hard as it can run, computing algorithms in order to earn a few cents every few hours?

So i basically provide an address for these bitcoins to bounce off of and I get a small reward?

What would I spend money on? Isnt it open source with free programs to mine? Or am i going to need tons of storage space and clog my gaming laptop up instantly

Ohhh.  Can anyone do it? Or do i need a backround in coding or a special OS like linux.  I run windows on a high end laptop.  Is it possible for me to mine. Or will it require to much computing power?

So by "solving" a block. You are basically finding a transaction

What would I be paying for?
