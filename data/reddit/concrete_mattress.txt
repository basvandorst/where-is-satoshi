This is the way to go...if you can get ahold of them. I can't even get them to fix their reporting system so I can do my taxes. They aren't accepting support inquiries unless it's about account mgmt or deposits.

Let's take your reply point-by-point so that we can arrive at the same point; it sounds like you're pretty adamant that Ripple is causing more problems than it solves.
You're right that it's not a coin proper; it's more of a trading floor than a currency, though it does have XRP for anti-spam.
I wouldn't say that they require it to be based on being in debt to others constantly.  Instead, I'd say that its based on having trusted parties hold your currency rather than having to hold it yourself, making THEM indebted to YOU.  You have to admit; there's a certain amount of risk to holding your own USD (theft, fire, dropping it on the ground) or BTC (hacking, HDD corruption, password forgotten).  That risk goes down quite a bit by having a (competant) third party hold it.  When was the last time your Bank of America, Wells Fargo, or Chase account went down because of a robbery?
My understanding was that Ripple has switched to decentralized now that the source code is out in the wild, but that aspect of the network is less well known to me.  If you have insight there, I'm eager for you to help me understand.  From what I can tell, Ripple Labs retains very little technical control over the markets besides the XRP they've retained from the launch of the network.
Ripples does nothing to solve the problem of having multiple currencies, I agree.  But fluid exchange between currencies is the best thing you can do in a situation where there are a lot of alternatives.  It's a stretch to say that allowing people to freely and easily move between currencies is going to prevent blockchain innovation.  Why not start a new currency with the latest blockchain technology and let it succeed or fail based on its merits rather than on its exchange adoption?

Almost stopped watching when she said new-Q-ler attacks.

Don't donate unless they use the coins for something.  If you donate, and they just go and liquidate them on the market, then you might as well donate USD because it does nothing for the cause.

Why?  What's wrong with Ripple?  If Google Wallet had Bitcoin, then it would support Bitcoin.  If it had Ripple, it would support Bitcoin, and Litecoin, and Doge, and all the others.  Why wouldn't you want that?

Bill also supports the BTC economy by spending them prudently on things he likes with vendors who accept BTC.  He doesn't hoard them; he uses them as they were meant to be used.

That's a great way to hedge against price fluctuations; good for you!
