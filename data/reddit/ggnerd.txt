MOST people think 50k is a nice chunk of change

Well that's just adorable

Prove it

I would say any amount you can afford to lose is worth it.
I'm using coinbase, the verification process is for security purposes. Idk if I'd trust something that didn't require proof

That's the dumbest shit

Weird. Had the same 15 min timeout when I bought a gpu from newegg. While I initiated the transfer in time it took like 30 minutes for it to actually confirm. Still worked and should have my gpu tomorrow

Well for a situation that's already been 'addressed' why doesn't he have his money? Because this post is just giving him the run around. I sure as hell won't be using Kraken after all these horror stories.

Yeeeaaars ago back when I got interested in the silkroad. I think bitcoin was about $2 a pop at the time. Oh if I knew then what I know now =P

Hell ya! Nice. You may run into an issue with the bitcoin payment option greyed out. Originally I was going to get the gpu and a set of risers. The set of risers were sold from a third party and I had to remove them before it would let me pay in bitcoin

I mean people usually only post when there is a problem. I imagine the majority of Coinbase users haven't had trouble. I haven't anyway
Not 1 company is perfect.

Ok, sell your house and all your shit and put it in bitcoin. Live in a tent

Gotta find something to hate on eh?

Meeeeee. There's been a few times over the past 5-7 years that I got interested in bitcoin but never did anything. At the end of last month I downloaded coinbase and made my first purchase. Currently have .14 bitcoin and 1.5 ethereum. Going out to buy a better gfx card to mine some eth later today. Started watching videos to understand cryptocurrency better. All of it has me really excited

He did. You still don't understand? He never said the guy couldn't say the word, not once.

The price you buy them at is locked in when you first buy them tho
