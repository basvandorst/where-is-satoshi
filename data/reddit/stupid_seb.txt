You cannot forge BTC transactions. That is why the blockchain was created.
BTC is actually the dumbest tool to use if you want to money launder. Everything is public and trackable.
Monero and anon-coins on the other hand... should be watched closely.
And... one last thing: money laundering is NOT creating money. It’s actually bleaching money. 
A money launder with BTC would work like that:
1- you got $100,000 from illicit activities
2- you buy BTC from an exchange or via OTC 
(Note you can skip to 3 if you got paid in BTC for the illegal stuff)
3- you ship the BTC on coinbase and cash out.
It’s coinbase that should be liable for accepting the bitcoin. By transforming them into Fiat, they actually can launder dirty money.
If you bought 1BTC, held it, and cash it out when its value increased, it is not money laundering. Just capital gains. 
Again, ultimately Coinbase should be the warrant. Not the bank.
*Note: The best way to “bleach” is casino (you get 90% of your gains back and can pretend a huge gain). It works even better if you are the casino btw ;-)
Car dealers work well too (low margins, high turnover activities)*

They want warranties, because their assumption, as bankers, is that the tech won’t survive and therefore that this revenue will not be recurrent.
So, it makes sense for a downpayment (should), bit not for the full loan, as the monthly payments should be a factor of your income.
Now, if you can show 2 years tax returns, it qualifies your trading revenues as “recurrent” (and generally if you are smart you have a LLC...).
I live in the US, but was born in Europe and had the chance to live in 3 different countries. My takeaway is that the American credit system is great (credit score), but that too many people (who should not) get access to credit... and get burnt.
It generates massive inequalities between the people struggling to pay their “debts” and the ones surfing on “cashback” miles etc.
Everybody should be responsible, but a system which is too open can be dangerous too (says the “communist “ in me ;-) )

Edit: I could be wrong...
 
My understanding is the following:
Starting with something important: the Japanese court does not recognize BTC as a legit form of payment. -&gt; settlement in FIAT. With a F like in the word “Fuckery”
Which means that MtGox will still have access to all the BTC once they settle at the 2013 prices... (they sold some via master Kobayashi to cover these future settlement costs)
The Mt Gox CEO expressed remorse and said he would try to make things right for the people who got screwed (to be continued)... 
What it means: there is a shit ton of BTC either waiting to be dumped to reimburse the plaintiffs in Fiat (but some sources say that the total amount already sold covers the fiat amounts needed), or that could be distributed to people who got screwed once. Most of them suddenly sitting on tons of cash could probably dump at market value to enjoy pina coladas in the sun...
If only they could BURN the freaking BTC...  i can give them *my burn address* ;-)
Who cares anyway, BTC is at 55% dominance, we are in interesting territories... 1.5 month to go?

Actually, if all the people wanting to support Bitcoin would mine at home, the relative hashpower of mining farms would drop, hence their probability of mining a tx.
As a result, their profitability would go down, some would have  o shit down, entering a virtuous sprial towards decentralization
It’s a lie to say that mining at home doesn’t help. Mathematically it does. Big mining farms just want to kill competition in the egg.

Hopefully it becomes better. Bc it’s the worst possible coin today. I still don’t trust a coin so centralized: both on the mining side and on the development side (look who controls blockstream)
Imho: The future is public but permissioned chains: ie some node structure with KYC for the high tiers. Typically, top nodes being the institutional clients for the coin (corporations using the chain for instance, like for VeChain)
Decoupling of alts vs BTC will shake a bit the ecosystem and we will see what survives...
@_date: 2018-06-03 03:30:13
BTC is a difficult position to take: there is a lot of decentralization, the team do not need advisor, and bringing businesses to BTC don’t really change the value as it’s a currency... and it’s highly manipulated.
Funds want crypto assets, ideally securities (utility tokens have limited potential), and want to know the team and be able to be on the advisory board for instance.
-&gt; pre-ICO private rounds are the way to go, with a massive premium vs the ICO (generally 50% discount)
In a way, it’s a lot like VC investments, something they know already.
But I am certain some have BTC as well, as a side investment too. But I’d assume it’s a minor position for most.

Money is badly managed for sure.
And people should have the right to decide how it’s spent.
I agree on that. 
But honestly, Zero tax is as stupid as 100%.
That’s why I say that 20% (or be it 10% if you want) is the “right” amount. A small amount will also be better managed.
When the military comes helping people under water un Florida they are sent without asking about the costs or the “revenues”. No private solution is managed well enough to do this today. Greed is too powerful.

Some people think that the government should deal with everything (Bernie...).
Others believe in a 100% by the market way (Austrian economics).
-&gt; Both extremes are equally stupid or naive.
I lived multiple years in 4 different countries and could witness some of the pros and cons of both sides. (From the crazy taxes feeding an inefficient country like France, to the US education system mostly private: expensive, sub-par and ... corrupted.)
The right mix is probably smthg in the middle: mostly privately managed, but controlled by independent organizations from the gov.
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:01:23
I second this position. The civilization is not there yet and some form of “forced taxation” is needed to have a society in 2020.
The issues today is more about the amounts taken... anything above 50% can be considered confiscatory. And if govs cannot make it work with reasonable amounts of tax, there are big problems to come. Current system is failing.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:28:58
Or maybe I used the word “criminal” as a metaphor ... or a hyperbole. ;-)
That said, I do believe that governments failed by taking too much responsibility. We don’t need a government to take us by the hand all the time. It should be limited so specific functions.
The result of an over-zealous government is probably an out-of-control-Budget and many spending lines or tax increases that get passed by people forgetting that they represent the people... 
Consequence: the current catastrophic situation with debt and the arms-race on spendings and taxes in some countries like France
That... and the WORST collateral effects on people:
 1- political moves to get votes (70% tax on riches) luring the poor into the false belief that this money will ultimately go to their pockets.
 2- a growing people’s belief that that state will help them, or even pay for them and that they don’t have to do anything in return (universal income). Others will pay. 
Add a bit of cultural tension (“racism” claimed here and there as an excuse sometimes) and you have the perfect cocktail for a failed country: a failing government, and a failing society.

Besides Folklore &amp; Marketing (1. and 2.)
Or the fact that this mining power :
A- is centralized (china farms)
B- relies on POW, which arguably starts to reach its limits in terms of consensus (vs. POS or dPOS, or POA).
**What are the real arguments?** (voluntarily provocative here)
BTC is a great currency on paper:
- storage of value (but speculative + some volatility )
- medium of exchange (only with LN for last transactions to real goods)
- unit of account (in regards to trading alts mostly today, in a centralized way)
But the tech starts to show some limits. (Besides the 10min block and high diff). And the Core team decided to remain conservative and not go beyond Segwit today (albeit taproot could be coming soon).
For instance, ETH does the same storage of value (similar volatility), medium of exchange (30s tx, still not huge but improving), and unit of account.
And regarding unit of account for instance , it’s arguably better bc it allows decentralized trading via smart contracts.: the famous DEX (BTC scripts are not yet enabled truly)

Step 1: buy a hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-04-28 03:23:20
1- noobs buy BTC 1st bc they don’t understand the tech. It’s the gateway, where the money enters.
2- bots tend to do arbitrage on BTC vs other alts (and everybody uses the same bots) when you have strong market movements. 
3- bc of its dominance, every move BTC does destroys alts with “bitmexrekt” like leverage.
Alts is where there is real value is (“business” wise), 
BTC is master on the currency side. (Adoption)
-&gt; until real adoption, king BTC has the power to screw up everything... and it has the leverage to do so.

Imho, but I can be wrong: 
It is not “he has a ton more to sell”
My guess is that he had USD based debts to pay. Something in  the $400M as I could read, to reimburse the people who got hacked (court decided a $500 price per BTC). Hence he doesn’t need to sell more atm. That is also why they communicate now.
The rest is either “profit for them (injustice)... or, more realistically they will prevent a massive class action and will distribute some to the “victims”, but it is another debate.
So, there is probably still sell pressure, but it could be more diluted.
Any info addition or correction is appreciated.

Noob question = a GOOD question
Per coin, YES, because the hash “algorithm” is the same on every platform.
Now, if it’s a proprietary “master seed” that generates private keys you cannot access... you may be screwed.

Initialize them with the same seed phrase.

Cost averaging is the way to go.
If you bought at 20k, let’s say 0.1 btc ($2k), then adding $2.4k when btc was at $8k (0.3btc) makes you an average portfolio of: 0.4 btc for $4.4k : **$11k per btc**. Better than most.
Edit: you can also cost average the price of your pizzas bought in BTC like that ;-)

If you are ready to lose what you put in, then you should not be that worried.
If you need the money, or if putting it into bitcoin put you in a difficult financial situation then exit the game.
Cryptos are a hailmary. It’s a shit ecosystem with shit people, liars and manipulators.  Scam is the baseline here. Greed is only third to stupidity and false-hope.
But there may be a silver lining... maybe... not even sure...
Seriously: Don’t stay if you are not 100% comfortable losing a massive amount of your money.
Get what you need out and leave what you are ready to lose.

typo corrected. Thanks mate.
I oversimplified using "trust", I agree it works differently.
I wanted to give a simplified answer edible to a n00b, from your address to the recipient address, LN requires a network of "connected addresses" to propagate the tx. Not necessarily trusted by you, but in a propagative way: A-B and B-C -&gt;  then A-C. Like internet packets... Once the path is decided, you just need liquidity on nodes for big transactions.
The idea is that the BANKS can be a useful part of the LN and re-become liquidity agents, which is one of their prime role irl. 
Thanks for the correction anyway. Much appreciated!

Seed is random: Technically you can generate your own... ;-)
So use a random seed given by the 1st one... and setup this seed on the other one.
The seed is just a series of words which is a “code” that will generate all the addresses for all the cryptos you have (btc, etc, vet, xml, etc..)
It is pseudo deterministic stuff... just google it (too many beers here already tonight)

If you bought x at $20k. It happens. No worries because normally you invested money you don’t need.
Ford the bold, there had been plenty of opportunities to rebuy 2 times more at $8k.
It would make an average value of your portfolio at $12k. And you could have exited at $11k if you had wanted.

I believe that pretty much the opposite will happen when institutional money will arrive.
Wall street doesn’t give a flying f$&amp;k about Bitcoin. They will sell non pegged ETF to Dolores...period
Because they cannot control it or seize massive positions. It’s not diluted enough. ETFs will replicate that with the possibility of “owning” the honey pot. 
Real investors, like T.Draper,  want to invest in projects with industry ties and solving actual solutions. 
New hedge funds like BlockTower (the excellent Ari Paul) are a prime example of the new ecosystem being out in place and waiting for a clear road to pour billions.
-&gt; As soon as regulation on cryptos are up, and some custodian solutions emerge, big money will flow into alts.
But... only a HANDFUL of alts...

They reimburse in fiat of course. Up to $250,000 in the US as per today. Then you buy BTC again, somewhere else...
They are the 1st to do that. I don’t like Coinbase: high fees, take ages to transfer BTC, etc... but their insurance is a really good step in the right direction regarding a potential “future of banking” for cryptos. At least for mass adoption.
We all want a $100.000 BTC. It can only happen with mass adoption and that comes with regulation, and reassurance of the masses.

Never ask to remove 2FA
This is how you got stolen
1st, you went on the fake bittrex, and hackers got your credentials.
2nd you thought it was sync issues in 2FA and removed security. The main mistake.
3rd that is how they got into your account and move funds
On Bittrex, you need 2 different 2FA codes to login and transfer funds.
Double check your gmail: if they got access to it, you probably have a keylogger somewhere.

No dip this time. Pretty much the opposite on BTC: ppl will buy hoping for an airdrop.
Alts may be challenged (being sold to get BTC), but the markets are more mature already than a few months ago, and people realized that alts went up like crazy just after the hard fork... on clogged exchanges (bittrex).

@_date: 2018-02-05 00:22:04
 Not sure. You pay for peace of mind with coinbase. Same mechanism for the people like you and I buying BTC. High fees, but you pay to have your bank credential safe.
Back to the topic: LN will have 2 impacts:
- close to 0 fees
- instant tx
But you need a network trustworthy of 3rd parties. This is where banks enter the game. And where merchants a like it even more: no need for an additional payment provider besides the one they already trust (their Bank).
Its a step back for p2p payments but a huge catalyst for payments.
Direct p2p transfers would still be possible with LN tought.

You think too much with your heart regarding BTC and USD.
As a decentralized system, mass adoption is the only way through. In the short term, I’d rather see a strong regulation and even some banks playing the game that the current masquerade we see today with a fork every 3 months.
BTC incumbents (1st movers mostly) are fighting for power and destroying the reputation of BTC.
Once it’s mainstream, The decentralization will be like an undertow. But 1st we need mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:26:49
Insurance is the solution.
Today, Coinbase has an insurance if they get hacked (not if you get phished).
It’s a good prototype of what services a bank could offer, on top of proposing you to buy BTC directly from your account (with a premium on price a la coinbase).
Frankly, the day my bank proposes me to invest some of my spare money in BTC will be a great day.

It happens. 
1- rebuy if you felt that you did a mistake.

I’d go gradually if I were you: re-buying 20% now and buying dips when they occur.
Maybe it will drop sub 6.6k and you will rebuy more there.

Depends how you generate the seed.
You can do that on an air-gapped computer... (assuming the computer is clean, which is probably the point you are trying to make)
And the idea is to help the OP to make sure his device is not compromised.
Based on the recent exploit, you have 2 ways: (once you upgraded the device of course).
1- generate a seed outside, and use it on the ledger: check if this seed’s addresses match.
2- generate 2 seeds on the ledger and check is the generated addresses are different.
Don’t check on the device itself but for instance on a MEW (external).
To generate your own seed... use the device if not compromised, or a “clean”, offline / air gapped computer (does roughly the same thing)

Data recovery could help.
If it is a Mac you probably also have cloud storage or Time Machine?
Otherwise you may try a hard drive recovery... last chance.

Bc you save paying 7% of interest.
It is a typical question of  assets allocations:
Reimbursement of a X% interest loan is better than saving money for a Y% return when X&gt;Y
Now, for some people loans are also a good way to learn to be financially responsible.
I think that cuban sees it from a traditional alfa/beta point of view, and due to the volatility on btc and the risk/reward he sees, a certain 7% “saving” on future interest is a good move.
Better than BTC.
I also believe he’s like 90% of the hedge funds looking at crypto: they will go ALTS, not BTC. Bc these guys are used to Venture Capital, where you invest on teams and projects, where you can snatch deals directly at the source etc...

Misleading title, in 2 ways:
1- (as said below) entering the market does not mean buying. They can short it too. (Even though I doubt they will short BTC)
2- the article mentions “cryptocurrencies” and the author keeps calling Bitcoin
There are strong chances that these guys will not even touch any BTC. They will invest in projects where they know the team and can buy otc deals, ie not on markets. More money will flow into alts (top coins 1st, for liquidity reasons) than in BTC, or even ETH or XMR. 
It’s crypto-VC we are witnessing.

Well said.
Unfortunately, the typical “*cryptoinvestus simplex vulgaris*” does not understand it.
And it is the same kind that does bitch about banks not letting them buy cryptos with their credit cards...

Spending increases utility value. But increases velocity, hence lowers monetary value. (PQ=MV)
Hodling decreases utility value. But also reduces velocity, hence increases monetary value.

My mistake. I come here with a “stupid_seb” nick trying to have an educated discussion about “alts” in a bitcoin maximalists thread. LOL

I respect your opinion while disagreeing:
Bitcoin is great for certain things, not great for others things.

BTC pivoted from P2P to a store of value solution. (LN can change that again).

You should immediately go on Bitmex and take a position with 100x leverage.

The good answer to your bad question is:
Don’t put more than what you can afford to lose
(And there is more than BTC...  BTC is just the entry point to the rabbit hole)

Idea: Take the time to  learn that there is more than BTC? (And identify the shit from the good in that new world!)
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:28:00
I do believe that the % of alts in a portfolio should be proportional to BTC dominance.
I feel like a biologist in medieval Iran here...
