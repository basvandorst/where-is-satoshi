The BTC example was for the people who can't part ways with their BTC. They get butthurt when I tell people to buy alt coins instead of BTC. I'm just saying that instead of holding on to them, or buying it at $17k, it's a lot better to buy a cheaper coin and double your investment much faster since the prices are going up so quickly. And it's better for people who are new to crypto. $17K is a lot of money. Buying $200 of BTC isn't gonna make you any money that's for sure. You have to wait for BTC to hit $34K in order for your initial $200 investment to turn into $400.

SIA was just an example. If you want to make quick money, then BTC isn't a very smart option, especially since you can easily double your money if the price of a cheaper coin goes up by a couple of cents, which is clearly what's happening to all the altcoins. And the cheaper the altcoin, the more money you're gonna make. There's a better chance of making more and faster money by investing in a let's say 5 cent coin than a $2 coin. The only way you will double your money is if that $2 coin goes to $4, which can take quite a while. Look at what happened to Tron. From 5 cents to 30 cents in a day... BTC won't jump from $17,000 to $30,000 overnight. Even if it does, you won't make as much money as you would from a 5 cent to 30 cent jump. You dump the coin when it reached a desired amount and then instead of buying 1 BTC, you buy 5 BTC. Simple.

Transferred some ETH from GDAX to another exchange. 12+ hours and haven't received it yet.

Did you tell them that it costs like $40 to transfer their 
Bitcoin? Should've offered them some Litecoin instead.

Should've invested the $10K in Ripple when it was 23 cents. Would've had $50k+
