Makes you wonder why this story is being suppressed?  Would cause too much fear in terms of security in the NSA- our oversight for all our metadata (at least the public thinks so

I appreciate your response and all the descriptive detail about what goes on.  I understand math up to or before calulus, but I think I asked the wrong question actually.  
So the mining that you are doing, what is the .67 hashes per day. As in I understand the mining is done to verify a transaction.  So does that mean that you helped verify .67 or a number of a transactions?  
I'm sorry thank you for any advice.

if I am in my wallet and I look at the Receive Coin's tab. then it says Address.  Is that my private or public key?
@_date: 2014-07-12 21:17:45
Ya I did I just created a coinbase.com account.  So Basically I'm trying to figure out which is my public/private key.  I obviously don't want to give out the wrong info.
I will do what you said and ditch my old wallet which obviously is old and outdated like you said. thanks

I downloaded my wallet 2 years ago.  I don't even remember setting up a private key or password or anything...?
@_date: 2014-07-12 21:09:21
Is the program Bitcoin Wallet, that you download completely different from opening a wallet at coinbase.com?
Which one is safer??

I'm very interested in understanding how this logarithm works.  Can someone please direct me and tell me what I need to learn in order to understand this? Like I know some calculus and everything before that, but I would really like to know where I can learn how the actual mining process works. thanks

Thanks a ton!  I'm not expecting any donations here I'm more or less trying to figure out the difference between a public and private key.  How can you tell the difference? it doesn't seem to show me on either my 2 year old wallet or my coinbase wallet.
Thanks for the advice and info much appreciated.

Okay so if I download a second wallet is it safe to give out the code to almost anyone to send money too?  Keep in mind I don't use my first wallet ever. I have not.  I was originally looking into bitcoin's for investment purposes 2 years ago, but now I see the value of it from fundraising to security to everything.

I know this might sound weird but I cant even tell you howmuch I respect you and your profession, and your ability to spread important information pertaining to the crypto industry.
I watched your 2 hour senate hearing, and learned a lot more from watching that than I have in a month of reading about bitcoin.  This was extremely helpful for me, and I cant tell you howmuch I appreciate you spreading knowledge on what the capabilities are of this technology.  
I look at it like the pirate bay.  you can shut it down over and over but the only way to kill it would be to eliminate the entire internet medium.  YOU helped me realize why "blockchain" technology has so much potential to change and decentralize different industries, well beyond "bitcoin". 
If anyone can edit or add to this feel free.  I am still in the process of trying to really learn all aspects of its potential, and just how important it is to the future of our global connected power structure.

My brother is a PHD student and is in debt in loans.  He will finish his  PHD in cultural anthropology very soon(next year).  He was born with crohns disease and has been doing great following his new treatment.  NOW after finally doing well he has Large Intestinal Cancer... I am quitting everything important in my life to raise money for him and I don't want to put my wallet info anywhere that can be compromised.
I have followed bitcoin's for the past 2 years but have never done anything besides downloading a wallet (2 years ago) and reading into mining.  I see the value of the cryptocurrency in so many different ways, and I think raising money from all different sources including bitcoin would be helpful.  Any information would be amazing.  
OR any ideas on treatment or methods of raising money or anything would help.  He doesn't know I'm doing this and explicitely told me not too because he does not want any FREE handouts.  I have to I have an obligation and I need to do everything in my power to make sure he is healthy.
Thank you

Thank you Mike Hearn for such a passionate well established article.  I really learned alot and can relate to all the points you have said.  Thank  you so much.

Hey thanks a ton for the follow up.  I believe that due to not being able to find it on the blockchain that the program I used to send it did not infact send it yet.  It was more along the lines of I transferred money from an online poker client(that uses bitcoins mBtc.  
Sorry to waste your time but I really appreciate the help and your time! Have an excellent day
@_date: 2015-08-27 05:04:58
Thanks a ton!  I will look for in blockchain now.  not exactly sure how but im sure I can figure it out!  Thanks for response!
