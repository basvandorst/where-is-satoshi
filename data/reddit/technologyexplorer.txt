Is this true that China can take control of BTC transactions from now on. And is it possible to them to block transactions from users specifically from US. 
If this happens or is true, then it can seriously affect the usage of the said crypto currency. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 04:50:30
That's the danger of going digital.....

There is hardly any difference between pound and euro. Its just marginal. 
If we see the pound- the currency of UK against euro which is the currency of other European nations, there is hardly just some cents difference.

That's where CredibleFriends differs my friend. You are not going to offer a bitcoin loan to whole public or who is in your contact domain. 
You will only offer bitcoins credit to those who are among your most trusted peers. I am sure that many of your friends you already know and have relationships must have earned your trust by now. 
This propels the ability for everyone to rate others and also adds the privilege of giving feedback for past loans, allowing you to judge their ability to repay loans. 
However, it’s important to be cautious when allocating credit. By giving small amounts of credits to new friends, you can reduce risk and have them earn your approval for greater loans.
BTW, trusted peers can not only be your friends, they can be your GF/BF, siblings, cousins and even our own parents( a rare phenomenon). 
One of my friend, who is now working as an apprentice has offered loan to her step-mother for shopping. Recently, she shared her experience on a messaging app.
So, that's what makes CredibleFriends World's first Peer-to-Peer Credit Card.

I think the block chain can identify your sub accounts which are in your wallet. But it will display the main address in the blockchain transactions so that your sub-transactions remain anonymous. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:22:08
Ohk.....but i read somewhere that all computers reward their users with a btc when they are asked to do certain amount of calculations. 
If we take Tianhe into account it does almost 3 trillion calculations per second. So, won't it reward 5-10 btc each day...?
@_date: 2016-11-10 15:54:51
I agree with you on new address regeneration. But i guess, the blockchain just keeps a ledger of the transaction which has taken place from Alice to Joe. But doesn't know details such as how many BTC are in A's wallet. Because if this happens, then any one can hack the wallet to get those coins.
May be someone who has some experience in mining can help us on this note. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:39:25
Hope, Segwit will remove all such troubles in future. But it wasn't officially launched on November 15th,2016......right?
@_date: 2016-11-03 15:50:36
Does the bitcoin mining hardware require a special network card and network line or will they work with normal web connectivity?
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:18:25
Got it....thanks!
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:20:38
Yeah that could have been a solution. But tending paper tickets in that rush would not have been possible.
It would have attracted more chaos......isn't it?
@_date: 2016-11-02 19:05:31
OK...got it! But I am sure that the enthusiasm of bitcoins will make you use the application one day.
@_date: 2016-11-15 03:01:52
I fully concur with the above comment. Government can do anything, if it wants to. Like how it started internet surveillance without the acceptance of US populace. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 05:24:08
It is on the route. We can easily figure this out with the way the currency is surging against the dollar and pound. This clearly means that people are trusting digital currency more than ever now.

I have a question. When Bitcoin is not a centrally dictated currency or doesn't have a headquarters like structure, how can new mining farms like Bitmain ( for instance) join the mining process? How will they start recording blockchain info? To whom will they report for the permission of mining..?
Hope, i am clear on what i want to convey. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:13:50
If we google about the Segwit benefits it says that it solves almost all transaction complications in bitcoins. 
But one of my friend said that she is observing a lot of transactions being delayed these days. Is it due to this new technology adaptation....? 
@_date: 2016-11-22 05:12:28
When bitcoins is a decentralized currency what will the government do to stop its usage. 
Will it block internet usage in their region....because that's the only possible way to block its usage in a specific region. 
Or will the merchants accepting bitcoins be targeted...?
@_date: 2016-11-15 03:23:47
Can you please be more specific on your concern? The theory is that bitcoins purchase remains anonymous. That's due to the fact that the transactions are can only be recognized by wallet IDs. 
@_date: 2016-11-10 15:42:20
FYI, blockchain doesn't know how many bitcoins are residing in a certain address. It just keeps a ledger of what transaction took place and helps in avoiding the usage of same bitcoins or a reverse payment transaction.
Suppose, if A has paid some bitcoins to B, then blockchain keeps  a ledger of the payment made so that the same bitcoins are not used and A cannot pull back the paid bitcoins. 
So, does this mean each bitcoin has a identity of its own, so that it cannot be used again and again.....?
Agree that I am not a bitcoins geek and so i am here to learn from this platform.
@_date: 2016-11-23 03:06:21
Oops sorry! I missed the '1'.
@_date: 2016-11-07 02:57:53
No, CF cannot steal the money which you are trying to lend to your friend. Hope, my reply this time is straightforward.
And about the commission, we are just interested in earning a small percentage from the 'interest' you earn. Not the percentage from what you debt finance to your friends.
@_date: 2016-11-25 04:12:51
If its a fake then reporting it makes sense. Appreciate your effort...?
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:35:12
Government showing interest in bitcoins seems interesting to me. May be the demand and usage for the digital currency in that region is forcing the government to adopt it as a mainstream currency.
But as per the stats, UK was the early adopter of this currency and still acts as one of the biggest markets for Bitcoins. But the region seems to be still not interested in making Bitcoins as digital currency... or am i missing the latest....?
@_date: 2016-11-04 03:31:27
Alright! Let me be specific.
CredibleFriends just acts a medium between two bitcoin sharing parties for a small commission. It doesn't meddle with your wallet at any instance and everything on its platform is crystal clear. The platform also verifies each member's ID proof, which makes the member registration authentic to a great extent.
Just download the app and see the difference for yourself. I am sure you and your friends will love it.
@_date: 2016-11-03 16:30:40
Well, this perception changes from mind to mind. If you can become a bank to your friends, it can make you a savior to them. Here, peer stands for not only a friend but also any person. Like your mother, sibling, GF/BF in some cases and cousins. 
About destroying a relationship, this risk exists in all money dealings between an individual and corporate. So, no lending is risk-free. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:25:01
Do Nigerians exchange in USD for bitcoins. Why don't they do it in their own currency....?
May be they are more interested in buying and selling i USD because it adds profit to their wallet.

Got it....thanks!
@_date: 2016-11-23 03:17:06
That's a good news! If more such deals are offered by merchants, then the usage of btc will grow in a healthy way. However, some websites are just duping and taking away the sheen of the currency usage with some fake deals and websites. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 04:01:15
Bitcoin is growing and as the awareness grows and benefits increase, its existence will surely be applauded. 
The main concern over here is that the big farm is coming up in China. We have seen it in the past that China has a penchant to dictate terms when its products or services get into demand. 
What if china starts to control the digital currency which then causes Cartelization? 
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:02:30
Well, I haven't taken anything from you yet. And whatever I advised you was an experience and knowledge of mine. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 05:02:14
So, does that mean we can lend or borrow bitcoins through Facebook. Won't it act as a relation destroyer then....?
@_date: 2016-11-23 05:36:27
Transaction fee is mandatory for all in and outs in electrum and depends on the block size if the user selects dynamic fee option. Atleast that's what the help page says. 
If you don't pay it, your transaction can be struck and may get lost in the network. Already had that experience long back 
@_date: 2016-11-25 03:37:42
People are in a wrong notion in India that they can use their loads of black money to buy bitcoins and convert them into white. For this reason, they are turning up to bitcoins exchanges to buy the digital currency.
But what they are missing are the basics. To buy or sell bitcoins a bank account has to be linked to the bitcoins wallet. And the fiat currency which is being used to buy bitcoins has to be available digitally. Means it has to be deposited in the respective bank accounts. So, before buying the crypto, Indian should deposit the money in their bank accounts and do the purchase.
In the meantime, Indian BTC exchanges are trying to attract the people selling BTC by offering higher selling price. This is to increase the availability of the cryptocurrency. But wonder how much is being paid in actual and is reaching the physical bank accounts after the deduction of transaction fees. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:10:41

@_date: 2016-11-04 16:42:58
There is no way CF can steal your money from your wallet. Everything is transparent and needs your permission. The only thing CF is interested is in the small interest commission of lenders. Nothing more than that.

Can we buy bitcoins directly by depositing cash in our BTC wallet physically. What i mean to say that if we need to buy bitcoins, we need to make an online transfer from our savings account to our bitcoins wallet and then proceed to buy bitcoins.
My question is can i buy bitcoins directly from Coinsecure by physically depositing money in my account through one of their regional offices?
@_date: 2016-11-25 04:01:05
Can anyone read out what the news post says and give me/us a gist of it...? 
@_date: 2016-11-18 04:47:53
The said crypto currency surely has a bright future ahead. Read on reddit that the buying of Bitcoins surged before and during the election season.
This clearly shows the way people are trusting and trying to bank on this currency. 
I also started to buy some bitcoins very recently i.e early this year. 
Bought around 3 BTC for $1900 and now the price of the currency which i own is nearing $2100.
Planning to buy gifts in coming holiday season or i will sell them.
Do, you think selling BTC is a good practice these days in current political scenario...?  
@_date: 2016-11-07 15:39:34
I have a question. why is that the bitcoins wallet is asking for your bank verification....? Or am i missing something...?
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:00:04
Keeping the bitcoin safely in your wallet will earn you interest first of all. As the currency is highly volatile, you can sell it in leisure. Volatility of bitcoins is in the upwards graph and will remain so at-least for a year or so. 
So, keeping it safely and selling it off after one year makes true sense. Similar to that of gold. 
In the meantime, you can loan some coins to your trusted peers through Credible Friends, which is worlds first 'Trust' based peer to peer application. With this app, you can earn interest on your btc and at the same time spread awareness among your friends about BTC and its usage benefits.
@_date: 2016-11-02 03:30:31
If you are really interested in knowing what exactly is a bitcoin and what benefits it offers against dollars , then I recommend you to follow this link which can educate you on the said crypto currency, its usage benefits and how you can save money by using the application service.  
The application is not just a p2p lending service, it is the world's first trust based p2p service which not only allows you to introduce bitcoins to your friends but also helps you earn some interest. I am sure, you might have some friends whom you trust to the core of your heart. Just ask them to lend some bitcoins and let them shop. You can earn interest on the lending and a the same time introduce your friends to the new world of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 04:36:00
I read on wiki that it will take year 2140 to reach the cap of 2 million bitcoins. 
May be its time for me to take the help of science and live longer. Or what about Cryogenic preservation...?
@_date: 2016-11-11 16:25:23
As per my knowledge, the generation of bitcoins will reach the threshold limit or the cap in 2140 year. Who knows what will happen then. 
And about transactions, i am sure that there will be more transactions by then. But the processing fee for maintaining the ledger might drop. 
It's hard to predict at this stage.
@_date: 2016-11-01 03:20:54
Well, that might be just a suggestion from the app my friend. Sometimes to develop business they need to tie up with some eco-partners and that's what CredibleFriends is doing.
However, it doesn't push you to use the wallet. The app is just a bitcoin's lending tool which offers you the privilege to debt finance your trusted peers.
All you have to do is to move the bitcoins from a wallet of your choice to CF and then start sharing them to earn some income through 'annual interest'.
@_date: 2016-11-25 04:23:32
The crisis is being negated politically. Actually it was a good move to curtail fake currency and black money. But some politicians are making a mockery out of it. They are trying to defend black money holders and want the government to revert the move back.
Now, coming to economic crisis, it is mostly temporary and people will see the benefits of currency demonetization on long run i.e after March 2017.
The benefits are bank interest rates will come down, home loans will become cheaper, corruption in government organizations will come down, tax evaders cannot escape and such....
@_date: 2016-11-22 04:51:05
Sorry for this sales pitch guys. 
Credible Friends offers Worlds first trust based peer to peer lending platform which allows you to lend bitcoins to your friends. 
The platform is aimed not at those seeking loans, but at those using preferential lines of credit to allow people to enjoy Bitcoin and its benefits. 
Through invites and social media, lines of credit will be offered exclusively from trusted sources: by friends to real-life friends.. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:14:58
Yes, in coming months most of the transactions above Rs 500 will have to be done through card of e-wallets. This increases transparency and can keep the tax bells ringing.
As soon as this implementation turns successful, Modi government is planning to scrape Rs 2k and high value notes on a permanent note. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:12:19
That's a very good suggestion. Having backups and business continuity plan will surely help in coming out of this situation. But many government organizations tend to be reactive than pro-active and that is what is causing a lot of problems these days when it comes data security.
Although, the media is doing its part in educating such organizations, they are still lagging behind. Lack of funds to buy required to buy IT infrastructure is said to be the prime reason. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:11:53

@_date: 2016-11-04 03:44:26
First, I would like to thank both of you guys for your knowledge share---Jcoinner and jl_2012. 
I have another question. When we buy Bitcoins in pounds and dollars, there is a lot of currency disparity as 560 pounds make  1 bitcoin and 730 dollars make 1 bitcoin. 
When Bitcoin is not a centrally dominated currency and is not governed by governments, then who decides the rate of each bitcoin in fiat currency and what are the factors which influence this trend? 
@_date: 2016-11-26 04:13:22
As most of the high valued currency is now in banks, people will be forced to take bank accounts. Already, in 2015 most of the rural populace were given free bank accounts. The jan dhan drive covered almost 70% of rural populace. 
The rest who do not have may be those living in isolated placed like tribals and all those immigrants who came from bangladesh. But the government will try to cover them in the next phase of jhan dhan drive and so all eligible people will be given a bank account.
The numbers which the media is showing are fake. Some are politically motivated and some are just speculations. In reality 70% of them have bank accounts. 
As most of the money is now stacked up in banks, the financial institutions will be forced to give loans at cheaper rates. The present Indian government is planning to offer home loan rates at just 1% in rural areas and at just 4% in urban areas in September next year.
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:20:54
I have a question. I am just new to bitcoin technology and heard that bitcoins are generated when a PC makes a certain set of calculations and rewards the user with the digital currency.
So, do all super computers working around the world, like Tianhe earn bitcoins to their owners. If this is true, then they can repay their investment within no time......isn't it?
@_date: 2016-11-03 16:50:17
Well, if more and more establishments come forward with discounts, then the usage of bitcoins will surely increase. Not all can afford Bitcoins shopping all times. This is where p2p lending of credible friends will act as a boon. 
Suppose if a friend is desperate to buy a phone( just an illustration) on a bitcoins discount, and he/she doesn't have enough resources, then you can lend that friend some bitcoins and make his/her dream come true. A friend in need is a friend in deed....isn't it?
@_date: 2016-11-14 03:37:36
In my view, it's better to act as per your instincts and take cautious steps. And what my experience says is that no matter how certain you are, you cannot isolate yourself from cyber attacks. 
Local Bitcoins is a good site to invest on and it gives the following explanation when it comes to its site security. 
Coming to Exchanging BITCOINS face to face it actually makes a lot of sense. By doing so, you can get instant money in your wallet in BTC or fiat currency( on hand). 
Meetup.com and Mycelium can prove useful.

I have seen this sticker in an international airport in India. The guys over there are very particular of people who carry precious metals like gold and diamonds. They do not care about currency in cash, as most of them carry their cards and use them. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 03:24:49
Yes, i believe and that's because, US or not other country in the world has the chance to ban or support decentralized money and that's what adds trust to BTC owners. 
Now, to those who ask 'What about Countries like China which is trying to take over bitcoins market?' 
Well, my answer is simple. It will try to monopolize its presence in digital currency market for a while. Like, how it did by buying most of the gold reserves a while ago. But the interest will be temporary and may not live a long life. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 04:44:43
As all public and private banks are regulated by RBI, there is no way for bank owners to run away with the money. Even if they do, RBI will have to answer to this evasion. And then RBI will deposit the same value of notes in the accounts of users whose money was stolen. So, everything is under a regulated process and control. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 06:09:08
This is insane! If exchange sites start to question their investors on their income source then who will turn towards them? 
Or maybe some countries in which these sites are operating have formulated certain rules for them. In order to allow customers carry transactions from a particular country, these sites have to abide by the law prevailing in that region.
Very recently, India has demonetized its high valued currency and asked its users to replace the old currency with new notes. Some black money holders might be thronging bitcoin sites to buy the digital currency in order to make the money white. In order to block all such users, coinbase might be using this new policy to filter down the users.

The drop can be due to investors fear that the currency's long term fundamentals are weak. But it's just a reaction to a concern and most probably will be temporary.

Well, I would like to share my opinion which can help you a bit.
I am using CredibleFriends from past few weeks and I recommend it to you as well.
It is truly the " World's first 'Trust' based peer to peer bitcoin sharing platform which allows you to share bitcoins only with the ones you can trust. This offers you two privileges. 
1.) The first is that you can earn interest on the bitcoins you have to lend. 
2.) The second is that you can get a repayment guarantee as you have debt-financed the bitcoins to your most trusted peer.
Isn't it incredible?
Just go for the CredibleFriends app from google app store and become a bitcoin bank to your friends. 
@_date: 2016-10-30 08:40:58
Bitcoins are digital currency. Here's a web page which will answer to most of your questions.

Any specific reason...?
@_date: 2016-10-30 08:29:46
They are many if you do a bit of research on Google. But if you need a 'trust' based peer to peer bitcoin sharing app, which also virtually allows you to store bitcoins, you can rely on 'CredibleFriends' app available in your google play store.
