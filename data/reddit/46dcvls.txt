What happened to the price of gold when it was banned?
What happens to the price of drugs when banned?
Considering that Bitcoin is mostly owned by people that see governments and central banks as being corrupt and irresponsible, there is a strong possibility that a Bitcoin ban would do nothing or even encourage its growth.
If the US says it's a threat to US financial dominance, nonfriendly governments may want to embrace bitcoin as a way to reduce the US global influence.
Dangerous to tip your hat on an issue you have no ability to control. It would make the government look very weak if they ban it, and it takes off like a rocket.

Its tripled year to date. There are massive profits being taken while we consolidate. Bitcoin can 100x in a year, but dont get greedy, 3x in 7months is incredible. Markets are pure psychology. It takes time and exposure for people to anchor a price/value.
Bitcoin will likely be worth millions per coin by 2032, but its not going to all be up and it's not going to be linear. It's going to follow the course as it always has, maximum pain. Spike up 100x, crash 80%, consolidate, relief rallies,  bull traps, bear traps, boredom, disbelief rally, bear traps, 10x spike, fomo, 100x spike, unsustainable, panic selling , 80% crash.

It would be nice if the time was labeled along the y axis to compare the temporal proximity of these forks. Also I think it's a little confusing listing client implementations when talking about hard and soft forks, particularly since the alternate client implementations of forks aren't shown, and not all Bitcoin clients are shown either.
Overall really like what the infographic is trying to accomplish, but feel it either needs to include more details to show a more full picture of bitcoins history, or make separate infographics focusing on different aspects.

Vote manipulation is obviously wrong, but it's not only foreign forces that seek to manipulate.
All major parties use deceptive and manipulative language , spurious facts , sometimes outright lies, in order to deceive people into not voting for or voting for a particular candidate.
The fact that people are surprised that foreign actors have an interest in the leader of the most powerful nation is what's alarming. Those who think they are immune to advertising are the most susceptible to ads. Those who arent aware that most major nations try to influence elections are the most susceptible to that influence.

Its discussed quite a lot.
What happened when the government banned private ownership of gold? Price skyrocketed.
What happens when drugs like insulin are more and more highly regulated? The price goes up.
What happens when drugs are made illegal? The price goes up.
If the biggest and most powerful government bans Bitcoin, and the network is completely unaffected, and the price just continues going up, it's not going to be helpful or beneficial for USD hegemony. USD is held by many foreign interests. If they see a reserve currency competitor shrugging off attacks by the most powerful nation/financial system it becomes a no brainer to rebalance reserve portfolios in favor of the antifragile contender.
The US government will make regulations more onerous but an outright ban would probably be great for Bitcoin. 5 years ago a ban might have seriously harmed Bitcoins future prospects,  but today that ship has sailed. Considering the sheer incompetence of government I cant rule a ban out entirely, but from a game theory perspective I truly believe it would be a very dangerous move.

This is why box and whiskers are often used to represent the price during certain intervals.
 Depending on the way its charted in a line graph, each 5minute period is represented by 1 data point. Is that the median price during those 5mins or weighted average or something else?
Even box and whisker can look different on different time scales but generally the whiskers will still allow you to visualize the extent of flash spikes and crashes.
Essentially the reason the graphs look different is that a line graph uses a single piece of data for each time interval and as a result must use some kind of average to represent that time interval. What is an outlier in the 30min chart may not be an outlier in the 5min chart , so you see it in one but not the other, causing the pattern to look different.
Use box and whisker and you can see all the outliers and where the majority of trades take place within any time interval.

You should have two of the 3 keys. At least if I remember vault correctly , they give you two keys and they get one and it's a 2 of 3 multisig wallet. The trick is getting the xpublic of the 3rd key to craft the transaction needed and then sign with the two keys you have.
So electrum cash or whatever the electrum clone for bcash is called will support multisig. You just need a watch only wallet with the 3 xpubs and then sign it with your two keys.

I buy via ach from my checking account. Coinbase charges their own 1.5% fee for all purchases like mine, big or small.
They deliver bitcoin to my coinbase account about 5 days after the purchase starts, but the price locks in at the time the purchase is initiated.
You only pay bitcoin transaction fees when you send coins from coinbase to your own wallet or another exchange. This is usually somewhere between $0.05 and $0.50 total . Transaction fees aren't much to worry about unless you're doing dozens or hundreds of transactions a day.

For quote a few reasons, technical, social, and political.
Keep in mind this is a reddit comment and not a full article so take these as jumping points to research further.
On the technical side: BCH has less than 10% of the Bitcoin hashrate. This single fact means that you have to trust that miners do not attack the BCH chain for profit. BCH can be 51% attacked with about 10% of BTC hashrate, several pools could singlehandedly destroy BCH. For this reason BCH cannot be considered trustless, permissionless, immutable, or finite. A small minority of miners can do whatever they want with the protocol. Infinite inflation, block transactions, go back and rewrite blocks, etc. 
Because the BCH roadmap is to increase blocksize prior to running into limits without concern for node operators,  only miners will even be able to validate the blockchain in the future. That removes another layer of trustlessness. And because the blocksize will always be increased before running into limits there will be no pressure to develop 2nd layers like the Lightning network.
Because BCH chose not to fix transaction malleability they will not be able to simply drop in developments made on Bitcoins 2nd layers, and they are already demonstrating their technical incompetence in simply keeping the chain from splitting.
There's more but moving onto the social side of the scam:
BCH promoters lie. They lie constantly about things that can be independently verified.
BCH supporters say they follow Satoshis vision and the white paper,  but they conveniently ignore Nakamoto Consensus outlined in the white paper which says that when there is a dispute over which chain is the real Bitcoin it is determined by the chain with the most accumulated work. The white paper clearly states that BTC IS Bitcoin, yet they go around spreading market confusion.
They lie about transaction speed and costs. BCH might be cheaper, but it's never faster. They have 10min block times too. It might cost you more to get in the next block on BTC but you always can.  They say 0 confirm are safe on BCH and not BTC when they are equally unsafe on btc and bch.
They rally behind known sociopaths, particularly CSW. How they can support a person who claimed they were Satoshi and claimed they could prove it and then threw a temper tantrum when he couldnt prove it, that is beyond me.
Then politically:
The flippening. The entire bch narrative focuses on tearing bitcoin down rather than building BCH up. It is their stated goal to destroy Bitcoin. They are using all arsenal at their disposal to do so, adding market confusion by using bitcoindotcom to promote BCH and RIP on BTC, using Bitcoin Twitter handle, and going around making shady deals with corporations to try to overthrow Bitcoin.
Just use this info as jumping points. The BCH scam is  the biggest in this ecosystem.

The markets are unsustainable yes. But the system can manipulate itself for an indeterminate duration. The economy will collapse if something isn't done to transition quickly into a organic sustainable economy, but this could take decades. It could happen sooner with some major shock or simple mismanagement.  Personally I hope it's at least 5 years off, if Bitcoin can integrated enough then it can be a life raft that can be transitioned into. Imagine if the US govt had major bitcoin holdings and then majorly inflate the USD currency . Causing the value of their Bitcoin holdings to skyrocket, perhaps way more than enough to cover all debts. Bitcoin if mature enough could he the global jubilee the world has long needed.

Everyone has differing ideas of the ideal state of future affairs. For me ending central banks and limiting power of governments is the objective. The dollar may never completely die but will lose relevancy in global finance.
The whales only have a finite amount to sell off, and in the case of global adoption, why would they want to sell all? If bitcoin reaches global adoption you will be able to use it to purchase goods and services anywhere. If its globally mass adopted people will readily accept it as people accept cash today. Even if whales sold everything they would eventually run out and the price would have to adjust . It would take a concerted and costly effort to keep the price down in face of overwhelming demand. That isn't to say that mass adoption is guaranteed,  but if it happens it is hard to imagine bitcoins not being worth millions each.

I remember paying about 10% above market price buying BTC from ATM before I started using coinbase due to my paranoia regarding linking bank account to coinbase. 
I paid around $660 per BTC when it was $600 on bitstamp. Obviously the difference of $60 now is pretty insignificant.
Fees will come down as volatility comes down, but until then I think its perfectly acceptable to pay 10-15% more for the convenience.
 I've also paid $700 for a single transaction fee to consolidate hundreds of inputs and I dont believe tx fees are too high.

Well there are clearly some fundamental assumptions in your reasoning that I certainly disagree with. I'm not sure you're really understanding what this discussion is about or if theres a language barrier.
Proof of Work is neutral, it doesnt matter who produces the work. The nature of the work is self verifying so there is no good or bad work, it's all just valid work. Tying in a blockchain where each blocks hash is tied to all previous blocks hash, with a proof of work system is what solved the double spend problem and thus ushered humanity into the age if decentralized trust. There is no point in performing any work at all if you arent following the longest chain, since it's the work that keeps the incentives best aligned with network security. If you arent following the longest chain there is absolutely no value to performing work. But if no work is involved then what prevents people from just altering as they see fit? The principle of following the most accumulated work is what solves this problem. You have to work in a way that's provable in order to update the ledger. The nature of the blockchain tying all previous states together means that you couldnt possibly recreate it without redoing all the previous work that was done.
Sure if people dont understand this then they might not understand the value or revolutionary nature of Bitcoin. The reality is that as time goes on the number of people who understand this will only grow.

In 5 years daily Bitcoin production will have dropped from 1800 to 450.
Considering there are currently less than 10million crypto users/investors(likely around 1million), it seems to me that in just 5 years there will be many more people involved, much more money on the planet, yet less newly available Bitcoin supply.
Another thing to think about. Bitcoin primarily appeals to younger tech savvy people. Yet these younger people tend not to have much money (simply due to age) as the target demographic grows in age and wealth it's only natural to expect this industry to grow.

The difference with Bitcoin is accumulated work. The rule of following the chain with most accumulated work is the defining, revolutionary security feature that allows Bitcoin (and all other crypto) to exist.
The only way in my mind for Bitcoin to be replaced (in terms of a decentralized permissionless finite ledger) is if a fork of Bitcoin gained more accumulated work. 
There may be cryptos that eventually have a higher marketcap, but I doubt any that have bitcoins properties, and without bitcoins properties other coins will eventually get corrupted.

It be more profitable to make the crypto yuan worth a floating amount of Bitcoin. I see this as an incredible engine for a new monetary system as it allows a country to inflate its currency while increasing the value of its national reserves.
So it starts out and maybe 1 crypto yuan is worth 10000 satoshis, but the way it is actually defined is that 1 crypto yuan is can be redeemed for one crypto yuan's value in Bitcoin. Now this has instantly done two things. By tying the value of the fiat to a floating amount of Bitcoin it increases the Bitcoin market cap by the total value of the fiat it now represents. It also instantly gives an exchange value for the new token.
China could mint as much crypto yuan they want and it would just depress its value in btc. However it would be even more profitable to continue buying more btc. Since it would be established that the crypto yuan is interchangeable with Bitcoin it should be no difficulty at all to continue to mint crypto yuan and buy more btc.
For the sake of this hypothetical, say China owns 2million Bitcoin when they begin issuing the crypto yuan. China can siphon off the wealth created by the users of the crypto yuan by continual debasement, and use the newly minted supply to buy even more bitcoin. This continues to drive up the price of their 2million in reserve, while adding to the reserve at the same time.
Once a few major countries figure out the mechanics of this new engine of wealth it's going to catch on like wild fire. It will give the first movers access to enormous wealth and power. It makes me sad that China might be one of the first movers because the more powerful China is, the worse for the future of the human race.

I dont think we disagree at all, I just saw your comments as a jumping off point to expand on. I'd never have high expectations for government but I do see an enormous opportunity for first movers. Once the right people understand this the only real options are to either try to fight it or join the Blockchain Race. If China really launches a tokenized yuan the US can either choose to fight it with sanctions and regressive regulations on crypto , or they can join the race and also launch their own. I suppose the 3rd option would simply be sit back and let other countries possibly take over the future backbone of global finance but that doesnt seem likely to me.

What most people are still failing to grasp is that payment systems have never been transmitting anything other than promises, promises ultimately backed by nothing other than permission by a central bank that says the transaction is valid.
Bitcoin solves the central problem by creating a true unit of value to back the modern monetary system. The real challenge now is to find ways to hook the current payment networks into sending promises of Bitcoin that are ultimately secured by the blockchain and actually backed with Bitcoin.
What is developing is a rube  goldberg contraption whereby a quick payment is sent but in the background sets off a complex chain reaction that ultimately ends with Bitcoin changing ownership.

If Bitcoin becomes the global standard of wealth then at that time the energy cost to produce a marginal Bitcoin becomes more interesting. When everything is measured in Bitcoin you can see an items value in energy. So in a sustainable economy items for sale would have to be sold for more energy than they required to produce throughout the entire supply chain.
In our current money by decree world, there is absolutely no tether between physical resources and money. This allows us to do stupid things that would never be profitable if it weren't for injections of money out of thin air. 
With a currency that is intimately linked to energy cost, if it were to globally dominate, would reintroduce the connection between the financial world and the real physical world. Why would you spend 50kWh to make something to sell for 25kWh of bitcoin? If your goal is to earn Bitcoin it would have been a better use of your energy just to mine bitcoin. In the not so distant future increases in mining efficiency will greatly taper off and the cost of mining anywhere will approach the local cost of electricity rather than the somewhat asymmetric race for the latest and greatest hardware we see today. 
This is the endgame that people talk about regarding Bitcoin limiting the power of government,  limiting war, and realigning the incentive structure of the world economy on a sustainable path.

It does come from monetary inflation, but it's more complex due to the fact the economy is always changing.
If you have the same amount of money but more people competing for that money , the value of that money goes up.
If you have the same amount of money, but more goods competing for that money, the value of money goes up.
So in a world with more goods and more people you can have monetary inflation that doesnt always cause price inflation. 
But then you throw fractional reserve banking and credit on top of all this and I have no idea how price inflation has not caught up more with monetary inflation.

With more coins essentially hoarded it just increases the value of the coins in circulation.

Paradigm shift happened in 2010 when fiat was first traded against Bitcoin. Fiat currencies are already denominated in satoshis. Tokenized fiat is a new avenue of wealth creation for the first few movers. With tokenized fiat, debasement  of the monetary supply will directly decrease its value in BTC. The increase in BTC  marketcap will outpace inflation for countries that own at least 5% of the circulating bitcoins. It's free money for governments until they kill the golden goose and we transition to a Bitcoin denominated global economy.

I would absolutely consider that wallet compromised.
Never ever expose your keys.
Make them completely offline on a device that will only be used to generate keys.
Sign transactions on a separate dedicated device that will never be used for anything else or ever connected to the internet.
Never say the words out loud near a phone, TV, computer, person, or really ever. There is no need to repeat your phrase out loud.
Do all that and all you have to worry about is physical security. As long as somebody doesnt physically get your keys the funds are safe.
But any kind of exposure at all introduces numerous attack vectors.
Your bitcoin is on a public ledger. It's like if everyones money were held in separate deposit boxes that you can see into and nobody is really watching them. The cryptography used makes these "boxes" completely impenetrable,  however if you happen to drop the key to the box somewhere,  somebody can take their time and try to open every "box" with your key.
By speaking the words over the phone you are now trusting your cell service provider, the phone manufacturer, and you have to trust that you yourself have not accidentally got your phone infected with malware.
Exposing your key takes the trustlessness out of Bitcoin.

Difficulty is calculated every 2016 blocks known as a difficulty epoch. The protocol compares the time it took to generate 2016 blocks and compares it to the ideal 20160 minutes (10min per block) then the difficulty is adjusted up pr down to normalize block production at 10min intervals. So if on average blocks are produced at 9min intervals difficulty will increase about 10% if 11min decrease about 10% the white paper has all the details.

Getting 51% to attack bcash wouldn't be that difficult as bcash is only at about 10% of btc difficulty, so just need 10% of btc hashrate to 51%. My understanding is that the attack on bcash is to create many extremely large transactions that completely fill up the 32mb blocks which will knock out many or perhaps even most nonattack bcash nodes. Simultaneously commanding a 51% attack to create one or more forks and possibly execute a doublespend.
Nodes may even fork without any hashpower directed.  Large blocks could cause propagation issues, such that simply competing blocks are found nearly simultaneously on opposite sides of the world and have 2nd blocks built on top before  the nodes are able to propagate the 32mb through the network. This already happens occasionally with bitcoin, though orphan rate is way down over the years. Large blocks will just exacerbate this.
Bcash is extremely vulnerable, they traded bitcoins security model for slightly increased transaction throughput. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 09:28:59
That's right , most nodes except some poorly connected miners and nodes run from data centers would be effected. Not to mention the disruptions caused when blocks are found 1min apart. The difficulty algo of bch is easily gamed and is being gamed right now. When the difficulty drops significantly blocks are often produced much faster sometimes even nearly simultaneously. Also 320mb per 10min would put the monthly bandwidth over 1tb, the cap most home users in the US have to deal with

What likely happened is two things.
1) They use a different exchange with a higher rate than what your app compares to. So you might be buying $40 of bitcoin at $12000 per BTC,  but your app goes off an exchange that shows $10k per btc.
2) atm fees, and transaction fees. The ATM likely charges 5% or more, and depending in how it handles the transaction fee, you could end up paying several dollars to the miners for the transaction.
The first is bad practice,  but the 2nd is just the cost of business .

What? No, this is unequivocally good for bitcoin.
It's not like theres going to be a switch that's on or off and suddenly everyone pulls their money from these negative yielding assets and puts it in Bitcoin. But what we will see is reallocation toward other assets. The more negative yields become, the greater the risk funds will be willing to take. If we assume a standard distribution of funds risk tolerance we can also assume that as yields go more and more negative,  funds spill over into increasingly risky assets. Considering there are funds at every part of the bell curve, any reduction in future yield translates into gains for riskier assets.

It is a bad practice,  but I've never seen a single custodial service provide fee options. In this industry at this point in time, if you want to buy bitcoin from a custodian you have to accept whatever fee they pay for your transaction. If that's unacceptable you can always mine the coins yourself , find a friend to sell you coins, etc. The reality is most people find its not worth the extra time and other costs to avoid a $0.25 to $2 fee. Coinbase doesnt even allow you to set your own fee.
I agree it's bad practice, but its difficult to avoid unless you're a miner.

I believe there is a difference between identifying a single economic pressure that benefits bitcoin versus making a claim that this one positive source of pressure will unequivocally cause the price to increase.
Now I do believe Bitcoin is insanely undervalued for many reasons, but I cant unequivocally say that it will gain value over time. 
It's kind of the concept of ceteris Paribus,  if all other factors remain equal then yes I would say unequivocally negative yielding assets will correlate to price increases in finite assets such as Bitcoin. But we live in a world of many, many competing pressures with various magnitudes so I cant say from this one pressure that it would unequivocally increase price, but ceteris Paribus I would say that's true.

Halvings and other events that fundamentally change the liquid supply or demand of the ecosystem cannot be priced in even if everyone knows about it.
While people will try to price these events in, the market is too dynamic to make accurate predictions.
The whole concept of events being priced in is fallacious imo. You can buy the rumor and sell the news, but if it's not a completely controlled market you simply cant know that x event will cause y price. That's why we get a profit taking sell off usually right after the halving and then many of those people go on to regret it when the true supply shock is felt months later.
Theres too many people with various decision matrices whose actions are all interdependent on each other. The market is kind of an indras net of money.

Because while it's entirely possible tether is a scam its absurd to think its responsible for a significant amount of the run up in 2017. Its the new willybot . 
What is so privileged about tether compared to the other 2000 scam coins? All those coins can also be used to pump the price of btc.  But the result is these other coins dilute the price of bitcoin, not add to it.
Tether is likely not to have a 100% reserve, but it clearly has enough capital to maintain its price target thus far. 
Just think about the market cycles. Bitcoin goes down so people sell for tether. Demand for tether increases , if supply was inelastic would cause price to increase. So more tethers are minted and sold for dollars or bitcoin to stabilize the price at $1 . Then when people feel the bottom is reached they sell their tether for Bitcoin and the price of bitcoin goes up. So it is a natural consequence that more tethers are printed just before the bitcoin price rebounds.
If it was so easy to manipulate the price with an altcoin why don't they all do it? Why dont I create an alt and pump the price of bitcoin to a million?
Because there is a market. As I sell my shitcoin it becomes worth less and less. The only way to keep the price of my shitcoin stable would be to be actively buying it back as I'm selling or somehow create demand enough to satisfy my selling. 
Again while its perfectly reasonable to believe this process is being taken advantage of to the fullest extent possible,  tether doesnt have any priviledge above any other altcoin.  Why doesnt everyone create an infinitely inflating stable price alt and just buy all the bitcoin they want?

This market is small and the majority of volume we see is not investors but the same few coins traded back and forth on exchanges.

I'm working on a correlative analysis of this exact question.

Obviously the two are positively correlated, but how and to what degree? I have a few other correlations with price that have a r2 of 0.95 or higher.

Our modern fiat money system has largely been invented within the last 100 years, with major changes 50 years ago, and continuing major changes to adapt to the digital age.
In essence economists pretend that monetary theory is a science when in reality it is just politics cloaked in pseudo technical terms. Our current monetary theory that underpins most fiat systems has not been time tested,  and the examples of similar monetary systems throughout history have all ended in their ruin.
The USD in particular is in a precarious position. As the global reserve currency its issuing nation (the USA) gets an enormous boost in purchasing power simply due to the demand for the currency. A large portion of dollars are held as reserves by other nations. A number of agreements with many nations and corporations is what created this situation, but as the worlds relationships are renegotiated we are seeing the USD lose dominance in the oil trade to yuan and rubles. If OPEC and other oil rich nations start accepting non USD currencies, then the USD loses a use case for being held as a reserve, which naturally means countries will rebalance. This effectively increases dollars in circulation and could be the catalyst to significantly increased inflation levels. If we get $5million bitcoins, its because dollars have decreased in purchasing power, which is a pretty good bet imo.

Decentralization 
The improbability of any new coin having the same level of decentralization (and therefore security, immutability,  network effect, etc) is just so tiny.
Any competitor must be so overwhelmingly and obviously better on all fronts to get current stake holders to switch. A competitor that tries to market to new naive investors will find themselves on an insecure ,centralized , poorly developed network. Competitors must convince current stakeholders,  not just naive entrants.

Bitcoin is a global standard. In a world of changing politics and allegiances, bitcoin just keeps growing stronger. This world is becoming more decentralized. As trust between nations wanes trade becomes more difficult. Nations can "manipulate" currency to their benefit. In the past the world has used gold as an independent global standard.

Theres a few ways to do this, and it's a bit easier to do with digital art than physical.
For physical objects you will still need a 2ndary database like a certificate with a log of all the transfers made.
The certificate contains a list of all owners and previous transactions. The certificate must be digital. At each transaction after adding the new transaction to the certificate, a hash of the certificate is made, and embedded into an opreturn field in a Bitcoin transaction. This transaction ID and hash is then added to the certificate for the next transaction to verify.
So you can see that each transaction ID has a hash that matches the certificate at each transfer along the way.

Price is moving extremely aggressively upwards, check out the daily and weekly candles. 
The behavior we are seeing is a kind of shakeout accumulation. Somebody or some entities want as much Bitcoin for the best price possible. If they just market order everything the price will skyrocket and crash back down and theyll end up with big losses.
So they buy up the coins at a certain price level, and then when the price moves up it clears out the few orders placed at this higher point. So in order to get more coins they stop buying and sell a little. The market stops moving up and gives people time to think that maybe its going down and to take some profit. So inevitably more coins get listed for sale at these prices and the accumulators can get more at sub $11k levels for a few hours/days. Of course it's always a bit of a gamble because the market could fomo,  eat their sell orders, and continue moving up. At which point it becomes a race.

But how would that scenario be a negative for Bitcoin?
First and foremost there is no reason centralized digital monies will not be subject to the same kind of controls centralized fiat money is. You cant just move fiat in and out of most countries freely, and since centralized digital currencies have a point of control, they will be subject to the same capital controls fiat is.
But even if somehow FBcoin has the properties you imagine, how does that take away from what Bitcoin provides?
Bitcoin is many things, but to me its main value propositions lay in Permissionless digital gold and immutable data structure.
With Bitcoin nobody can lock you out of your funds, nobody can counterfeit(including authority), nobody can push a button and prevent you from transacting with any party you choose. Its financial freedom in the digital age and I think there is an extremely high value on that alone.
Then the immutable data store, the blockchain. There is immense value in storing hashes of documents, art, media, and other data in the blockchain to for proof of existence, ownership, and many other records. Even less secure blockchains can anchor themselves with bitcoins security by storing their hashes in the blockchain. These applications are quietly growing and I believe the value these will provide could even surpass bitcoins value propositions as digital gold.
So yes, people may use FBcoin for some payments, just like people use Visa, PayPal, applepay, venmo,  etc etc. That in no way takes away from what Bitcoins value propositions are

Mining reward has nearly halved since the $14k peak and yet mining difficulty reached it's all time high earlier this week when bitcoin was at $7.5k.
LTC is still often mined with GPU's which can mine many various currencies, whereas BTC is only significantly mined with ASICs which only have a few SHA256SHA256 alternatives.

Hard to say,  it hasn't exactly been what we have observed in the past. Bitcoin mining is far more decentralized now than in the first reward epoch when only a few hobbyists were involved.
There are obviously benefits to centralized hashing, but also benefits to small miners.
Big miners have to deal with a lot more overhead for cooling, warehouse space, electricity, maintenance,  etc. Big miners are very visible, easily subjected to regulations, moratoriums, crime, etc
The big miners typically get a better deal on electricity and hardware, but are much more sensitive to being unprofitable. A corporation burning through $1million a day will be very quick to shut down, whereas a smaller operation might not have any expenses and just accept less revenue.

There is a difference between wincing and just being thrown in the wind of sentiment/emotion.
Nobody enjoys seeing their assets go down in price (unless you're underinvested), but that's different from feeling hopeless or that the whole industry is crumbling.
I swear everytime the price goes up 10% all anyone can see is a straight shot to $1Million, and when price crashes 10% all anyone can see is a straight shot to $0. 
Bitcoin was designed to be resistant to long term manipulation,  but extremely pliable for short term manipulation. The finite supply and logarithmic supply curve means that in the long run suppressing the price can only occur by stimying demand rather than flooding supply. But in the short term there is nothing to stop whales from playing all sorts of games. So dont play their games. Buy and hold, or dont. If you want to gamble go to the casino , but you cant outsmart and outspend those with teams of quants and billions in backing.

Miners arent going to mine empty blocks to protest low fees.  The fee market is made by the users not miners.
If the same number of people are transacting why would they start paying miners more? Only if all miners worked together to set a fee minimum, which would be very difficult to achieve in a decentralized system.
Fees will increase over time and become the dominant source of miner income, but this will always be led by the users who are willing to pay more, not because miners hold the network hostage for more fees. Essentially bitcoin transactions will become more valuable over time for a myriad of reasons, and this will be reflected in the free market cost.

It's almost certainly never going to have consensus , so no this isnt going anywhere.
If pools want to set their limit at 300kb nothing is stopping them. If nodes want to not accept blocks over 300kb , nothing is stopping them. The current observed reality is the state of consensus.

You can lock in your price with Coinbase immediately,  whereas you must wait for your fiat transfer to clear on CoinbasePro before making a purchase.
So you pay a 1.5% fee on Coinbase , but you lock in your price per coin at the moment of your choosing.
If you transfer $9500 to CBP to buy 1 Bitcoin, it might take several days for the funds to clear, at which point Bitcoin may have risen (or fallen) more than 1.5%. So even if you dont pay any coinbase fees you're still ending up with less Bitcoin than had you just eaten the 1.5% coinbase fee originally.
I think of it like this; if you're a trader that plans to keep a fiat balance to buy and sell regularly, CoinbasePro makes sense. If you just want to buy and hold, you're doing so because you think the price will go up, so why would you want to wait several days and possibly miss much more than 1.5%?

Because China does not control 70% of the hashrate, it's pure ignorance that this gets repeated.
What is true is that China has some influence over some mining pools that cumulatively have about 70% of the hashing power. The pools themselves only control a very small fraction of that 70%, the vast majority are simply profit seeking miners that will move to whatever pool is most profitable for them. If Chinese controlled pools started directing the hashpower to attack Bitcoin the pools would lose their miners very quickly, they will have shown their hand , and that will be the end of them and any chinese influence.
This all comes down to the fundamental game theory that Bitcoin is built on regarding incentives within the system reinforcing the security model rather than a downward spiral tragedy of the commons.

I'm not saying there isnt real value. I'm saying that real value is decided upon by supply and demand which is just an extension of human psychology. Essential goods and services have value outside all monetary measurements because a person will spend everything they have to satisfy basic needs before spending on anything else. 
My problem is the assertion that value is tangible , with the exception of essentials there is nothing you can hold or touch that has a value independent of cultural psychology. You cannot eat gold, its impractical to build a home or clothing with, its value is purely decided by mass psychology.

Mainstream were/are perfectly happy with fiat currency. It only makes sense that Bitcoin was created and supported by people outside the mainstream , because the mainstream had no reason to question their monetary system.
As far as any specific ideology,  I wouldnt say Bitcoin is only for libertarians, but obviously its going to appeal to people who value personal liberty above all else. I believe Bitcoin itself is apolitical. It's a technology whose success does have social implications.
I would say that Bitcoin is not for bootlickers. People that get into Bitcoin purely to make a buck and dont care about its principles will get fucked.

Bitcoin has grown is all. The cypherpunks and anarchists are still here. Part of bitcoins success relies on people's greed. Beyond the philosophical reasons to get involved in Bitcoin, without a financial incentive it would never grow beyond the small group of freedom activists that originally supported and built bitcoin.
A world where Bitcoin plays a large part requires/forces changes to global governance,  regardless of the intentions or beliefs of the participants. It's not necessary for all participants to believe in the freedom principles behind Bitcoin in order for those properties to impact the world. Just as it doesnt matter how many people want and believe in freedom who use fiat, it doesn't change the way fiat has shaped global governance.
I cant speak for everyone, but I believe Bitcoin achieved a certain kind of critical mass in 2017 and is essentially guaranteed to continue gaining relevance in global governance. It doesnt need the fervent adoption efforts that the community used to rally behind.

Supply reductions simply cant be priced in correctly.

But profits are based on demand for products often without necessity. Profits are dependent upon demand for mostly non essential goods and services whose demand can shift on a whim. 
A homestead or primary residential property is the only real essential tangible asset on this list. Everyone needs a place to live, regardless the dollar value there is always utility in a primary residence.
A stock in a company that produces fidget spinners luxury vehicles, computer parts, widgets, etc, isnt worth anything if the demand dries up, just like Bitcoin.
Now I'm not arguing against diversification, but this concept that stocks, gold, or currency have any value beyond the mass psychology that drives supply and demand is fallacious. The value of all items that are not essential for life is entirely driven by supply and demand which is simply a product of mass psychology. So on this list the only one that is categorically different is real estate, specifically a primary residence.

It depends on your philosophy and risk tolerance.
If your coins on coinbase are all your holdings then I would consider that irresponsible. The likelihood of an event like Coinbase getting hacked or forced into liquidation (or "repatriation") by executive order seems insignificant, but the reality is it's very difficult to assign probability to such catastrophic scenarios. On the other hand we know that never in bitcoins history has a private key been hacked, so if you are capable of good opsec and can keep a key private and accessible then you dont have to worry about external risks like Bitcoin exchanges getting shaken down or pulling an inside job.

I used to think this would be important, but the more I thought about it the more I realized changing the unit of account only makes sense once it's really used as a currency.
Everybody knows how fractions work and those that dont arent important for Bitcoin (either in price appreciation or adoption). Changing the base unit from Bitcoin to milibits or satoshis makes sense when you are comparing to objects priced in those ranges. When you're spending money it's more intuitive to spend 100 units than 0.0000001 units. But until its value stabilizes in a few decades you'll always be needing to figure out the dollar value for any product and then convert to bitcoin. Most wouldn't feel comfortable shopping with prices only displayed in Bitcoin without doing a dollar calculation to compare to. If I was selling socks for 0.001 bitcoin would that be a good deal? Youd say to yourself that's an $11 pair of socks,  they'd have to be some great socks. If I said its 100,000 satoshi  and you know a satoshi is 0.00011 dollars it would take even longer to do the mental math. In a future when you can spend Bitcoin anywhere , the price will somewhat stabilize, and organic satoshi pricing will occur.
Anyways,  changing the unit of account will happen organically. If you want to see prices in satoshis most wallets will do that. Trying to rally exchanges to adopt an inorganic standard to make Bitcoin more palpable to dullards is just silly in my opinion.
In the past there was a lot of buzz about adopting the bit standard, where a bit was 100 satoshis. Even more convoluted,  and obviously not a generally recognized unit today.

That's the trick that allows the wealth creation engine.
They don't say each dollar is backed by 10000 satoshis (or whatever)  they say each dollar is redeemable for a dollars worth of bitcoin.
So as people exchange their dollars for Bitcoin the price of Bitcoin goes up relative to the dollar, meaning each person gets less and less Bitcoin per dollar as time goes on, yet still maintaining the backing. 
When people want to exchange their coins back for dollars they can just print the dollars, thus increasing the value of the national holdings relative to the dollar. Have a large enough holdings and their value will increase at a greater rate than the fiat currencies value will decrease. Once a few major nations figure this out we will see a global Bitcoin race.

1) Miners will get 50% less Bitcoin. All else being equal this means 50% less revenue for miners. The Bitcoin blockchain is a single entity. If some miners stop mining this just means new blocks are added at a slower rate temporarily. If 50% less mining is taking place then it would take 20minutes on average to find a block instead of 10minutes. After 2016 blocks (approx 4 weeks in this scenario) the protocol will self adjust the difficulty required to find new blocks. After this difficulty adjustment blocks will be found every 10mins on average again.
2) No. The blockchain is a highly distributed accumulation of extremely low entropy information. Miners all work together to add to the blockchain, so it doesnt matter if one or many stop. If all miners stop mining then new blocks stop getting added and Bitcoin would die, but the blockchain itself would not disappear until all copies were deleted. Regardless in such a scenario nobody would care because it would be worthless. At this point in time, barring a solar flare or nuclear war it is simply preposterous that 100% of miners would stop mining.
3) Satoshi was brilliant, but there is no such thing as knowing the future. Satoshi clearly believed in the project, but they were not clairvoyant. Anyways I'd hardly say whomever it was, was in it for "quick money" and there is a significant probability Satoshi is dead. Consider this ; Satoshis stash of bitcoins is worth an estimated $7billion USD , and yet Satoshi has never touched any of them in 11 years. All of them are still at the original addresses they were mined to. What kind of person has the fortitude to invent something that makes them worth billions and never so much as spends a single dollars worth? I'd wager Satoshi is dead or is a group of people who split the keys in such a way that they need unanimous approval to spend any ; and one or more are dead / lost. It does boggle the mind,  if Satoshi is a living individual , how and why theyd go through the trouble of creating Bitcoin to never enjoy the fruits of their labor.

Bitcoin usage has soared over the past 2, 5, and 10 year horizons, and that is reflected in the price of bitcoins.

It's the opposite of fractional reserve.
With fractional reserve, bankers realized they could utilize 90%+ of the capital saved by loaning it out to others, taking all the profits for themselves, and then get bailed out if they get overleveraged.
With bitcoin the marketcap increases by atleast $10 fo every $1 saved into bitcoin. Some estimates are closer to $50 per $1. So instead of allowing some unnecessary middleman take advantage of the time value of money, bitcoin holders are rewarded directly by increase in value created by other depositors funds.

Those assets only have the value that people assign to them, and most of those assets are not essential for human survival and therefore their value is entirely subjective.
I'm not saying a company doesn't have value, I'm saying its value is derived ultimately in the same fashion as gold, bitcoin, fidget spinners, etc. Which is simple supply and demand, of which the demand side is entirely psychological when we arent talking about essential goods.
Take a 2080ti GPU, or a stock of Apple to a starving village in Africa and see how much this tangible good is valued. Most of the goods and services in our economy only have value because of our cultures mass psychology. Go to NY or LA with the GPU or stock and you'll get much further. While you might not be financially valuable with 100lbs of ramen in the US, you wont starve.
So saying a stock has tangible or intrinsic value compared to gold, currency, or bitcoin is just not true. All these things have value driven by supply and demand only, ultimately price is an expression of human psychology.

Consensus! Nobody decides!
It's an open source network, anybody anywhere can update their node and so long as it doesnt make any consensus breaking changes will run just fine. If updated software is released on some random torrent but it was discovered to offer great improvements without breaking consensus, it would eventually get adopted and spread.
If you are asking who can introduce forks when the github dev's are gone, then you dont understand the system as it stands. Nobody, no group can introduce consensus breaking changes to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a consensus driven network and the only way for a consensus breaking protocol change to ever have the chance of being called bitcoin is in the event the fork achieves most accumulated work. 
The network drives out those who attempt to break the consensus rules. Look at gavin andresen, once respected core developer but now widely viewed as a naive enemy of Bitcoin. The same would happen to any current dev's that try to break the consensus protocol. 
So making changes to the Bitcoin network that dont impact consensus rules is trivial, does not require any kind of distribution channels as self interested parties will always seek out the best implementation for their needs. 
The existence of the github repository is a gift, its great that we have such talented and dedicated individuals donating their time and energy to improve Bitcoin for all. But eventually it will come to an end and that is perfectly fine, development will continue along many other mediums.

But the literature you're basing your research on is not legitimate! 
It would be similar to making a questionnaire about the safety of vaccines "are you aware of the link between vaccines and autism?"
Yes there are academic sources that have made that claim, but they are thoroughly debunked bullshit.
Just like there are academic studies that deny anthropological climate change. These studies exist but they dont represent a consensus of those actually knowledgeable in the field.
You can find an academic source for almost any claim, and it doesn't mean it should be an acceptable source for a research paper. The fact is that the scholarly literature available on Bitcoin is tiny and almost entirely written by people with no experience or knowledge of the sector.
I realize that this is an assignment, and thankfully wont be published.  But in my opinion it is not ethical to publish on subjects the author is completely misinformed or under informed on. It just spreads misinformation and can now be another academic source to lend undue credibility to these factually incorrect opinions about bitcoins energy consumption , or its use for "crime".

Bitcoin can be useful in these situations, but it's not straightforward yet because the global infrastructure is still in its infancy.
So your first problem is donations being stopped by a bank or other financial intermediary. You must convince your donors to send Bitcoin rather than traditional fiat, which requires a bit of education on their part.
Then you get Bitcoin, excellent! But now you need to use it. You'll either need to find an entity that can exchange it for local currency or spend it directly. Considering your political situation I can only imagine it is going to be difficult to find an entity to exchange large sums regularly. So you'll need to convince the people you are transacting with to accept bitcoin.

Bitcoins success does not rely on mainstream adoption as a payment mechanism.
Bitcoin is already it's own killer app. Sound, permissionless money, secured by the only known immutable , decentralized database in the world.
The fact is that the mainstream will never want to use the Bitcoin blockchain, and that is ok and normal.
Why would a normal person want to use a currency that they are fully responsible for? Regular Joe's dont want to have to learn about elliptic curves in order to safely secure their life savings. They dont want to have to think about confirmations, fees, seed phrases, mixers, privacy, etc. 
With a credit card they get cash back, can do chargeback, dont have to calculate capital gains, and if it is stolen or fraudulently used the customer is usually compensated.
Bitcoin will continue to grow and integrate into the global financial infrastructure, and over time those who are primed to understand and align with Bitcoin will, and will benefit greatly. While the vast majority continue to sit on the sidelines, not understanding or feeling like they already missed the boat.
Gold has always existed as a superior form of money to fiat, and not many regular people have significant gold investments. With bitcoins value being harder to convey to the average person, I can only assume bitcoin will be less enticing to average people than gold
Thankfully average people dont have nearly as much financial power as non average people, a truism, but important distinction nonetheless.

It may never crash in fiat terms. Check out stocks priced in bolivars, been on an epic tear for years.
That's what many of us woke up to in 2009. Banks and governments will print money to keep the system up rather than letting irresponsible businesses fail.
The issue is short term vs long term thinking. Letting a bank fail means depositors and innocent people lose. We could bail out the bank customers by m0 inflation, but that would have a huge impact on consumer price inflation. So bail out the people and you increase everyones cost of living , bail out the banks and the money goes into the stock market and assets, the rich get richer.
The only responsible long term solution is letting banks fail and forcing individuals to weigh risks and benefits of storing their money with various institutions. But this would result in massive economic fallout in short and medium terms, and no politician nor most individuals want that.
I believe that Bitcoin is a way out of this system, not just for individuals but first mover governments. Any nation that can amass 5%+ of all bitcoins can use them as a bootstrapping mechanism to both get out of debt and print an almost endless amount of Bitcoin backed fiat.
Similar to how the gold standard changed from a dollar being a specific weight of gold to being exchangeable for a dollar worth of gold. Except the total supply of gold is flexible and therefore more difficult to manage the engine of inflation.

Those hardforks found consensus because they corrected security flaws , which as I've stated would be the only way a hardfork would achieve most accumulated work in the future.
There is no situation I would support a hardfork except in the case that a discovered bug or flaw would make the non forked chain vulnerable. 
I mention bcash as an example not to insinuate an association. Bcash is a perfect example of how future forks will unfold. Hardforks require the network to behave in a more coordinated way than a truly decentralized network is capable of. Despite how great new features might be hardforks require active participation from every single user. The bigger the network effect and decentralization,  the more likely that some pockets of users wont even be aware of the upgrade, or will disagree, etc. A truly decentralized network wont agree on anything except when the security of funds is in question. A security bug with a clear fix will and have been adopted quickly , but other than security vulnerabilities,  getting a decentralized network to agree on anything is impossible.
Bitcoin hard forking to improve features, rather than fix a critical bug, would lead me to believe bitcoin as a decentralized project a failure.

Bitcoin is sufficiently decentralized to ward off any kind of hard fork attack.
If you can make consensus breaking changes there is nothing preventing an increase in the total limit beyond 21million and other nefarious actions.
Hardforks are centralized and self selecting by their very nature. Bitcoin cannot hardfork by definition. In the early days a hardfork was possible because the network was not decentralized. Today any hardfork is a failure of decentralization. Should a hardfork overtake most accumulated work I'd say the Bitcoin project has failed.

I hardly see this as something that would happen all at once.
Banking crisis causes many banks to fail , possible, but unlikely. 
I'm here precisely because governments dont let banks fail. Government letting banks fail en masse would be quite a shock and somewhat unprecedented. There is no good reason to allow banks to fail other than a dedication to sound, responsible, sustainable, monetary policy. Obviously neither the FED nor the treasury are concerned with those principles so this just isnt going to happen.
Governments are already front running the expected economic downturn by reducing interest rates and printing money. Governments and central banks are absolutely committed to printing money as a means to keep the system afloat. 
If Venezuela can maintain sovereignty for years in the midst of continual hyperinflation, the US and other major currencies can certainly stay alive with much greater levels of inflation.
Basically there is no way in hell that central banks and governments dont just keep printing money to keep the system going, and there is room (barring a black swan like all US bond holders cashing in simultaneously) for at least a decade if not several decades of debasement before we get to Venezuela levels.

Your understanding of consensus is highly flawed. 
Segwit was a blocksize increase that was implemented without breaking consensus. There is a difference between improving the software and altering the consensus rules. 
Bcash was a blocksize increase that was implemented via hardfork.
Look at reality. Which chain is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the chain that did not hard fork. This is a tautological truth, not an opinion. 
Forks can and will happen, but they wont be Bitcoin. Bitcoin will always be the unforked chain.
The only possibility for a hardfork to be Bitcoin would be in the incredibly unlikely event the hardfork sustains most accumulated work. That's how bitcoin works. If you dont believe me dig a bit deeper.

That's why we have Bitcoin. Fiat currencies will always collapse given enough time. Bitcoin provides a pathway out of currency collapse .
It's part of a new jubilee for the global age.
As governments approach hyperinflation , after paying off their foreign debts and accumulating a btc stash, can then decree that each dollar (or whatever fiat) can be exchanged for a set amount of Bitcoin. This immediately stabilizes the fiat exchange rate, and if it's a major economy that does this, also greatly raises the value of Bitcoin. Which also causes the btc backed fiat to gain in value.
Government can then continue printing money as long as it can satisfy demand for people exchanging it for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin can provide a painless path out of our current guaranteed debt crisis. Whether it actually manifests is to be seen.

It never could compete on ease of use.
First, buying bitcoin you face hurdles. Storing and sending require education. Spending in most countries is a taxable event.
The reality is that payment networks arent sending anything other than a promise to settle at some later point in the currency the users desire.
Visa settles in dollars in US, pounds in Britian, Euros in Germany.
Visa, PayPal, and others are payment networks,  not monetary systems. Payment networks can send a promise of Bitcoin as easily as a promise of dollars. Lightning and other higher layered networks will help increase competition between centralized payment networks and decentralized. Ultimately if you need the security or permissionlessness of the blockchain you can always pay for a blockchain transaction.
The world already had good payment networks, but lack a sound digital money for the modern age. Bitcoin is the nucleus for a new global financial system. But there will be services and products around that nucleus to make it easy for the mainstream.

So why didnt you just increase the blocksize then dumbass? You can change whatever parameters youd like yourself, there is no authority to reckon with.
Now if you want to be in consensus with the rest of the network then you'll need to not change any consensus enforced rules, but there is nobody who says what consensus is and what the new consensus will be. 
Some people did decide they would change the blocksize parameter and hoped to achieve consensus with the network. When it failed to gain consensus it became it's own fork. 
Any bitcoin user at the time had equal amount of coins on either side of the fork. The vast , vast majority of Bitcoin owners decided that increasing the blocksize via hardfork was not desirable and thus sold off their bcash tokens, causing BCH to fall to it's current level of about 0.06 btc.
The developers do not decide squat, the users do. Bitcoin development forked and if Bitcoin users actually wanted bigger blocks, bcash would have become bitcoin.

I've always felt that taking advantage of Bitcoins immutability is one of the main utilities that give Blockchain transactions value.
Whether that's altcoins that secure themselves via bitcoin, traditional p2p transactions, other time stamping purposes, even using opreturn to store hashes of important documents, hashes of original content, etc
I've always felt that Bitcoin is much more than P2P transactions, and in fact I believe most P2P transactions do not need the extreme security and decentralization provided by the blockchain. Over time the majority of blockchain transactions will be higher layer settlement transactions, businesses and governments using it for a myriad of purposes.

No such thing as true value but price is a simple function of supply and demand. When lots of people decide to invest in one lump sum at the same time it causes a surge in demand , and since supply is completely inelastic, the price spikes. Then once all those people have finished their lump sum investments , demand falls back to baseline and supply actually increases as people panic,  causing price usually to undershoot its equilibrium level. Eventually people stop panicking and price is a function of demand and mining supply added.

It was created in response to government pilfering the purchasing power of many fiat currencies in order to address economic downturn.
It's not that Bitcoin will go up in value during a downturn per se; but the recognition that downturns happen regularly and the government's response is always to print more money. So bitcoin is a way to insulate yourself from what is widely perceived as inevitable hyper or near hyper inflation of most fiat currencies.
It makes sense that until fiat truly fails that bitcoin goes down during economic downturns, but comes back better than ever at each economic boom due to all the money printed to soften the downturn.

Well yes, teasing apart the minutiae of supply and demand is complicated,  but ultimately the current price is a function of the supply of bitcoins for sale and the demand in dollars that want those coins.
Ceteris Paribus, There are 1800 new coins per day that must be purchased at market price, either by miners or the broader market.
Over time this new supply dwindles, so again ceteris paribus, the same demand meeting fewer coins means the equilibrium price must rise.
Obviously there are many factors that can cause things to not be equal , but we cant consider unknown unknowns since by definition they cant be predicted.

Lol if this were true (which it is absolutely not, just a bunch of unsubstantiated nonsense), but if it were true the FED wouldnt just be shooting themselves in the foot theyd hit the femoral artery.
Bitcoin was created because of FED and central bank manipulation. All those seriously involved understand are involved because they understand central banks lack the power to undermine bitcoin so long as it retains even a tiny following.
The more the price is artificially manipulated downward against demand, the more coins the true believers soak up. 
Eventually they run out of coins to sell to the true believers and then the market takes off again. The lower the price, the quicker they run out of coins.
Gold is a bit different. If it was easier to store and transport it wouldnt be as easily manipulated. Because of difficulty with storage and transport, most gold investments go into paper gold, which makes it extremely easy to manipulate. You never have to run out of paper. Bitcoin is a bit complicated, but ultimately far easier to store, secure, validate, and transfer than gold.
Not only that but gold mining is flexible. When gold surges in value operations that were previously unprofitable become profitable, increasing the daily gold production. We are producing more gold per year than at any other point in history but only 25% the amount of yearly Bitcoin we produced 10 years ago.

On the blockchain, You can never lose your coins due to insufficient fees. The coins are spendable from the original address until the transaction sending them to a new address is confirmed.
So even if you send a transaction that gets stuck for days, you can "doublespend" and create a new transaction using the same coins from the same address, but use a higher fee. An improvement called replace by fee simplifies this process considerably. 
Now some 3rd party services do have time limits, so if your tx is not confirmed before the time limit, the service doesnt recognize the payment, even if it confirms after the time limit. In this way you can lose coins from low fees, but that is an issue with 3rd party processors, not bitcoin itself.

Wtf anyone can see hashrate is at an all time high and we will make a new ath difficulty tomorrow. 
There is a reason we use 2016 block intervals to determine hashrate, because there is so much variability over shorter durations simply due to the random nature of block finding. Bad or good luck over a few hundred blocks is not uncommon, but the statistics of using 2016 blocks removes the influence of luck.

Its bitcoins nature. Didnt you see it shoot up $1500 a couple days ago? 
Imagine a very hypothetical scenario. Imagine billionaires and governments all wanted a significant position in Bitcoin. But theres really only a few million coins that are in the market for trade, the rest are locked up in cold storage.
If you wanted $10billion of bitcoin how would you do that without a lot of slippage? Over a long period of time while simultaneously doing everything you can to keep your accumulation price low.
Now imagine theres hundreds, thousands of entities all trying to get a significant bitcoin holding, all with various strategies. Sometimes their strategies will add together and sometimes cancel each other out.
Essentially the price will become less volatile as it becomes easier to enter large positions without slippage, which is only possible with much higher prices.

Basically a pointless conversation, your friend is opening up with a question that betrays deep ignorance and cannot be rebutted without a serious time commitment to their education.
Ask them what their definition of a ponzi scheme is, and how Bitcoin fits that definition.
Theyll probably spout stuff like greatest fool, no intrinsic value, etc. Then you need to ask them what intrinsic value is. Then when you point out that the vast majority of all things of value have no intrinsic value (outside food, water, shelter), theyll probably cling on to the fact that there is nothing physically backing Bitcoin.
Its honestly an exhausting and pointless conversation. 
You could talk about the value of permissionless, finite , decentralized money. Digital transactions that arent subject to political interference, value that cant be diluted through inflation, and a public ledger that keeps the ecosystem accountable (to the protocol). 
As others have said it's best just to casually explain your interest without trying to sell them the idea, and if you're right (as most here believe) you can enjoy the shadenfreude when they realize they ignorantly dismissed and attacked your interest in an asset that could have brought them financial freedom.

If other currencies weren't shit why would anyone care about bitcoin? 
Bitcoin is an international standard of value, and as such competes with central banks, reserve currencies, and store of value assets.
As cracks appear in the network that maintains the integrity of these centralized fiat currencies, it reminds us that alternatives like Bitcoin exist, which do not share these same weaknesses.
Countries that hold USD as reserve may feel uncomfortable that an asset they are deeply invested in,  is having its base supply manipulated erratically in the best interests of their central banking system,  rather in the best interests of USD holders.
This repo operation could be the beginning of major changes to the way the central bank operates , and as such impact interest rates, inflation, purchasing power, economic growth, and even geopolitical stability.
Nothing could be more relevant to Bitcoin than the dominant fiat currency showing signs of stress and mismanagement.

The data would simply be more vulnerable to chance and therefore less reliable of an indicator of the true hashing power. Mining is done by throwing out as many random hashes as quickly as possible and looking for one that satisfies certain conditions. It's a random process that relies on statistics of large numbers. So if you used a 10block interval for instance,  you will eventually, simply due to luck, find those 10 blocks at a 5min interval average, resulting in a 100% difficulty increase , despite the actual hashrate remaining unchanged. On the flip side the inverse can happen as well. It results in a less predictable average block time, increases the game ability of the difficulty adjustment algo. 
It's the same reason you need over 1000 people for any reliable survey, if you're looking for the true mean, youre going to be more and more significantly influenced by true randomness(luck) the less measurements that are taken. 
Sometimes you flip 10 heads in a row, it doesnt mean the coin itself changed. Sometimes blocks are found much faster or slower than 10minutes even if no miners were added or shutdown.

Who would fund the security of this separate blockchain?
In theory its possible,  but in practice nobody would invest serious resources into mining a parallel chain without rewards. So then you'd need to make an altcoin to reward them with.
A different strategy would be a soft fork, but it would require miners opt-in which just is not practical. Nobody is going to voluntarily choose to use the resources for an extra hashing algorithm when it is not explicitly required. If a serious threat to sha256sha256 is discovered I imagine softforking could gain consensus, but even then we might get a tragedy of the commons where it fails to be adopted until the threat is actually impacting profits.

While the operation is ongoing it is defacto money printing. It looks like will go at least until mid october.
It's like a payday loan, you cant meet your payment obligations so you take a short term loan (in exchange for some assets). They must then repay this loan + interest the next day. So unless there is reason to believe there will be an increase in net deposits to the sum of $105billion ($75billion overnight and $30billion 14 day loans) then this will need to go on indefinitely.
Again its like a payday loan, of you didnt have enough this month to cover your expenses, why would you have enough next month not only for your regular expenses, but to also pay the principle and interest on the loan you've taken. And just like payday loans the answer will be to take out more debt, the repo operation will expand considerably or there will be a bail in announced.

If it were to happen so perfectly like that, then yes it would be a neutral impact on miner revenue.

Bitcoin ultimately will empower decentralized power structures and disincentivize centralized structures.

Well we can see there is about $1billion USD in estimated on chain trade volume (excluding likely change addresses) and about 350,000 transactions per day. 
So the average size is around $2800.
Bitcoin isnt supposed to be anything, it is a consensus driven network, not a product. If it doesnt suit your needs dont use it or learn how to use it better. 
If you understand the white paper you understand that transaction fees are intended to wholly support the networks security , it was always a foregone conclusion that if Bitcoin achieves widespread success that onchain transactions will be limited to extremely high value transactions simply due to the fees required.

Once Bitcoin achieves a non insignificant fraction of global commerce , then we can talk about other currencies losing value against Bitcoin.
Until then it's obvious that Bitcoin is gaining value over other currencies, not that they are losing value compared to Bitcoin. That would imply you could buy the same amount of goods with 1BTC 5 years ago and today, but less goods with $300 5 years ago compared to today.
Sure, the dollar has lost value, it is goat shit fiat after all. But the real story here is that Bitcoin is gaining value over fiat, which is actually much more significant at this stage of use / adoption.

It's a legitimate question with a nuanced answer.
First we need to address the concept of a mort gage,  a death contract.
Why are homes so expensive that they require most people to enter into 30 year debt contracts ? 
Well theres several reasons, but debt based money is one of the biggest. If mortgages didnt exist would people stop living in homes?
Yes and no. Real estate would be much less elaborate, more functional, smaller, but ultimately would cost far less per sq ft than in a world where it is expected to take on 30 years of debt just for a roof over your head.
So from a consumer side, why would you take out a loan denominated in Bitcoin unless the interest rate were very low ? And since most consumers would shy away from such loans it would mean that in a bitcoin only world the cost of home ownership would vastly decrease as there wouldn't be many people looking for loans in a deflationary asset. 
Long story short, in a Bitcoin only world you would be less likely to need a loan to buy a house. I doubt we will ever have a Bitcoin only world, but I do see a world where fiat currencies are all ultimately settled with Bitcoin.

The nice thing about hard forks that break consensus like increasing the total coin limit, is that those who want the change must convince the rest of the network to change, otherwise without node operators actively changing the software , those who want change will isolate themselves without broad consensus.
BCH proved this in practice over a much more minor change. Without broad consensus hard forks fail, and there is no way to ever achieve broad consensus over changing the coin limit. Many would rather bitcoin die than increase the limit, I am one. The total coin cap is fundamental to the sound money revolution.

People involved in conspiracy often do not understand how they are being utilized. The US government obviously conspired to use the 911 attacks as a pretext for invasion of unrelated nations. That doesn't mean that the hijackers were motivated by a desire for a US invasion of Iraq.

Exactly! The payment solutions that already exist arent sending anything, just a promise to settle in the customer's preferred fiat at some point in the future.
There is no reason PayPal, Visa, venmo,  cant send promises to settle in Bitcoin. You want trustless P2P you use blockchain transaction. You want inexpensive blockchain anchored transactions you can use l2 networks like lightning. If you want fast, easy, and cheap, you can use L3 networks like PayPal, Visa, etc.
Bitcoin is ultimately about settlement. You have to convince businesses and individuals to want to settle in Bitcoin. Once that happens all the current payment networks can be used to make Bitcoin payment easy.

They dont sell bitcoin. They take your money and write a balance in your account, but you cannot withdraw, send, store or use the bitcoin network in anyway. If you cant withdraw it's just not bitcoin , they have none, any hand waving otherwise is just smoke and mirrors. Bitcoin is not like stocks , you do not own bitcoin if you dont own the private keys. Everything that is not confirmed on a private key are fake satoshis.

Ultimately it would , yes.
Bitcoin has value because free market participants assign it value.
USD has value because the US says it has value, settles taxes and debts in it. Without the US government the USD would quickly collapse.
A partial shutdown really means nothing at all though in this context.

Because its silent theft from the majority of people who work jobs with sticky wages and the vast majority not educated on the importance of making investments to avoid inflation.
As an investor inflation is good for my investments, but many dont understand or have the capital to invest and the majority of working class people lose purchasing power while the rich get richer.
It's an artificial stimulation of the economy that incentivizes wasteful spending just to avoid inflation and puts our whole civilization into massive unsustainable debt for dubious immediate benefit.

I thought it was perfect. The tougher the interview the better opportunities to address criticism. A lot if people think just like that dinosaur,  so an opportunity on air to confront those thoughts is fantastic.
I really liked the way he started talking about money as a belief system. I thought he could have taken it further by tying it into the comments made about gold being a trusted money.
"Money is a belief system, two people believe something has value and to use it as money to trade with each other. Throughout time people have believed in everything from gold, to seashells, as money. In modern times people mostly use government issued paper money. Most of these belief systems have died over time,  but others like gold are still widely used and highly valuable today. It's not a matter of luck we dont use seashells or weimar republic notes anymore but still use gold. It's the properties of limited supply and durability that allows something like gold to retain value over thousands of years. Bitcoin was designed as a digital equivalent to gold, both in its durability and limited supply. Its network is designed and deployed from the ground up to be antifragile. To be extremely resilient to attempts to harm it, and actually become stronger due to those attempts. Bitcoin is an apolitical money,  its digital gold that can be transferred anywhere in the world without relying on governments or other 3rd parties."
But they'd have gotten interrupted a dozen times trying to get that out.

Only peoples demand to settle in fiat gives it value.
Transacting a $1 bill a trillion times does not make that $1 worth more than if it were traded 10 times. What matters is how much demand for that $1 bill at any one given time.
The fact that people transact in fiat is because they want to settle in fiat , they dont settle in fiat because they are transacting in it. 
Of course fungibility is a necessity for a transactional currency to have value,  but it is not where the discrete level of value comes from.

I think it would be an interesting and valuable test of the ecosystem. While it is true that fees would increase significantly , I'd be surprised if this event added more than 1 million transactions to the network, and in the worst case scenario where it takes place all at once we are looking at a 4 day backlog or so.
It might be good for the ecosystem to figure out how to handle multi day long delays in confirmations , for people to come to understand that transactions cant get lost and what tools are available to speed up the process. Innovation arises from necessity,  people will innovate solutions around the bottlenecks as it becomes necessary and this helps bitcoins utility grow.
Maybe it causes some bad press and more short term negativity,  but showing how a bank run on Bitcoin works is valuable.
I believe a lot of the drama we see is somewhat manufactured events in order to test game theoretical principles built into the bitcoin protocol. Its ways of seeing in the real world with real world money and incentives how this bitcoin system operates under various forces.
The bch fork and failure of s2x demonstrated the lack of central governing body in Bitcoin, and demonstrated that bitcoin is governed by decentralized competing interests, users, exchanges, businesses, miners. It demonstrated the importance of backwards compatibility in preserving network effects.
The current drama in bch demonstrates the importance of following the chain with most accumulated work(BTC), and that chains that dont respect most accumulated work are vulnerable to attack and reorg at any moment.
Seeing how a bank run works in this ecosystem I believe would be extremely valuable, even if it causes some chaos.

While I agree most consumers are ripped off, its also important to remember that marginal  cost does not equal cost. The number of skilled hours input to design, iteration, and testing h is a huge burden that must be barred by manufacturer. 
For small scale production it does not surprise me to see something like this near $1k. If it mass produced and injection molded anything over $100 is absurd.

What would BTC be without the Euro?
I cant believe its controversial to say that government issued currencies would cease to have value without that government backing it. Yes the market is what gives everything value but the market would assign no value to a state issued currency whose state abandoned it.
Similarly if all miners left , the market would not assign value to bitcoin. The difference is nations come and go all the time, Bitcoin is designed to last independently of nations.

Basic supply and demand. Bitcoin is divisible by 100million units so the value of those units will go up and users will send less. Just like how a pizza cost 10,000 btc a few years ago and today we spend less than 0.01 btc. If Bitcoin is desired its value will rise as the units become more scarce, and its increase in value incentives people not to lose it. In the past one might have wrote off a loss of 1 btc in a locked wallet, but today most will go to great lengths to recover a single bitcoin.

Hashrate does ultimately decide , but I think your missing how much incentive miners have to do what the rest of the network wants and keep their golden goose. That and if it is that trivial for 70% of miners to agree on something like that then bitcoin has already failed as a decentralized network.

If you have free power that can't otherwise be stored the only question is if you'll make more BTC mining with the machine than the initial purchase cost. Most recent generation miners this is a good bet if you have completely free power that would otherwise be wasted.

Yes and no. They can and will do both.
They will borrow as much as will be bonded to them. After creditors stop loaning out money they will certainly print until its value is 0 rather than be honorable and admit it's a fraudulent system and allow it to collapse.

The very idea that this could be touted as a possible solution is beyond insane.
First and foremost binance lacks any power to rollback the Bitcoin blockchain. That's the whole point of decentralization,  that the network continues to function normally regardless of any participants desite to change,  alter, or otherwise damage Bitcoins security model. Binance are completely powerless to accomplish this and honestly sound retarded by making it seem like something they can just decide to do.
Second, if they could do so, it would absolutely destroy the whole industry. So why would they be suggesting a solution that would destroy themselves,  unless they are making this suggestion in bad faith,  for one reason or another.

I'm a long time bitcoin believer and investor but this is pretty fuzzy logic for investing.
I agree that a lot of money people spend is wasted and could be better spent on Bitcoin, but a lot of that wasteful spending enriches peoples lives and really is not a waste.
There is also truly wasteful spending that enriches nobody,  but most people dont recognize this kind of spending or else they wouldn't engage in it.

An educational scholarship would be the easiest, longest lasting charitable use of your money. You get the advantage of having your name on the fund and create a legacy.
Obviously more involved works could have greater impact, like an animal shelter, a massive community garden, a small power plant to compete with local monopolies and drive down prices. The more passionate you are and the more of your energy put into it the greater and longer lasting the impact on the world.
