Every couple of months I buy 1 btc and that's served me pretty well.
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:10:03
Hmm. Good reasons.

I don't want to play devil's advocate, but isn't freedom good and government intervention bad? Yes the Chinese Monopoly is bad for Bitcoin, but what act that is unlawful or even unjust at play?

I don't trust PayPal ever since they scammed me out of $1200.

I actually agree. People can often times see through the guise of being an "agency" when really you're just one talented guy. Best to embrace what you are sometimes.

Feel free to put the time or even a whole clock face in the middle. Qr codes are highly redundant and it will still read just fine!

Bitcoin is essentially cash, I can beleive that. "Buy only what you need" is a rule I follow closely with cash.
The percentage difference between "essentially cash" and "is equal to cash" is the percentage of your wallet I think everyone should spend.
Think about it, if I beleive bitcoins have a 90% chance of taking off (which I do) let me spend the remaing 10% that I have no faith in. It mitigates the risk of losing that 10%, while sustaining or improving the value of my other 90%.
Similarly, if I beleived bitcoin had 0% chance of taking off (let's pretend I still have a bunch of bitcoins though) then I've given up on 100% of my bitcoins and might as well spend them all.

I want to believe its running an android tablet or an iPad but if its like any other atms it'll be running a full copy of windows complete with the whole computer inside. Makes no difference for the customer of course but I like to see tablets being put in things.

Computer parts from overstock and bitcoinstore. Both were super simple and perfectly integrated, I was surprised how they pulled it off so well.
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:29:18
My company Vergilis is there as well. I'll for sure be integrating seamless bitcoin payment in the future. We are a marketplace for services, including the payments aspect, so we could eventually let our entire list of service providers accept bitcoins!

Thanks for the info. I actually just bought some from some random site but I'll definitely support your store when I need a refill!

Maybe there's a way to make an all in one nstaller dpkg for uploading to aws or digital ocean? That would make a lot of people switch to p2pool

These low priced bitcoins are coming mostly from a big sell by a few big players...What is better, that wealth is concentrated or wealth is distributed? Seems like its better for the average person to buy regardless of where the bitcoins are coming from to me.

Cool project, I hope it becomes real!

Hey I didn't know about this. Def want one. But, wasn't shift the first Bitcoin card?

Oh yeah my cousin vinny did this

Plaid is not a payment processor, Plaid provides an API to turn bank username and password into information about your account, including all transactions history and bank account and routing numbers. Thier sole purpose is to invade millions of people's financial privacy.
To avoid them is easy- always opt for using bank account and routing numbers to accept payments online.

Hmm proof of work is kind of an indirect proof of stake. Instead of your coins on the line, it's your money spent on mining operations. As long as something is at stake, crypto is stable. So proof of stake seems like a good idea, because it ties your stake in directly instead of indirectly.

I might prefer choosing the exchange rate of my transfers, but I really want to give this a try.

Do you want a new hobby? I mine 24/7 on a single 6990 and I wish there was more reward but if I can do it, you might want to too. Consider the cost of electricity and use this calculator. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 03:17:54
Yes but they claimed not to store it. Didn't check the terms and privacy policy so I can't confirm.

Something like this might do the trick

Perhaps you could use multiple services at once. If I am accurate I'm guessing there are $3 billion worth of bitcoin in existence so slippage won't be a big issue. Unfortunately even with all services combined I don't think you could manage to pull out more than $100k/week, maybe $200k if you involved a secondary bank account.

Can you use the asic used for bitcoin mining to crack a wallet? If not, why so?
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:39:47
Just a word of advice:
When you use plaid, you authorize plaid to download and rummage through the entire history of your bank activity. Every single purchase. Every single thing. That's fucked up.
Make every effort to use routing and account numbers to send and receive money into and from exchanges. Do not use plaid.
