because most of the early customers paid when bitcoin was worth about 100-130 range now they are worth almost 1k and refunds would be given back in USD
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:22:36
Trillion dollar market cap does not necessarily mean that a trillion dollars has to be pumped into bitcoin, what is offered on the open market is a small fraction of the total amount of bitcoins created, most people are holding.  So i think its somewhere in between these two gentlemen's sentiments.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:05:45
i don't think he misspoke i have heard that number from him before, shouldn't only whats being offered on exchanges for sale matter?  because if most people are holding and aren't offering 12 million bitcoin for sale on the exchanges then it becomes more valuable, right?

I think that people are trying to measure Bitcoin strictly quantitatively instead of qualitatively.  Stop worrying so much about how many dollars are going to be put into bitcoin and try to think of the many improvements to the financial industry it is going to bring.  That is where Bitcoin will get its true value.

made it to the front page with the typo must be pretty good :) , You are right the whole interview is great, he speaks to armory,  some gold buggers hatred of bitcoin, bitpay, and much more.. 
More importantly i think as an early adopter, the fact that he's interested in building out the infrastructure to make bitcoin something great is something to really take from this interview, Trace and others who are sitting on fat bitcoin holdings are not just sitting around waiting for the price to go up they are being proactive.

The "its not a big deal" posts are meant to get us used to mining pools owning that size of chunk of the network.  Well we all know its a big deal the idea behind bitcoin, is the lack of trust in a central authority.  The entity owning that portion becomes a liability.  
 I feel as though the only way the centralization of mining power on the network 'issue' will work its way out will be for community organized asic chip development which can be sold  for a very cheap price... &lt;5$.  These can be distributed to everyone and it will become sort of like running a node, one wouldn't really do it for profit, but for a vote on the blockchain.. preferably on a p2p pool.  The time for this is probably coming soon, asic chips are going to be really cheap and easily reproducible.  I think the centralization issue is only temporary, and perhaps this would be next step to think about to keep the blockchain decentralized. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 04:54:59
that could be the case or a big buyer knows the fed is going to sell and dumps some coins in order to drop the exchange rate so they can get 30k coins for a lot cheaper.

The total amount of bitcoins offered on Mt Gox is only 18k bitcoin, if you times that by 3 exchanges there is only around 54k total offered on each exchange, now if we give that number some wiggle room and say there would a total of 500k offered( completely arbitrary) that is nothing near the total amount of bitcoin is the ecosystem but if thats what is only being offered i could see the price jump up like that.

Like i said bitcoin doesn't necessarily have to be worth that much to stay as relevant as it is now, but i think that the coin would have to have some value to continue to capture the attention of silicon valley and other investors, and entrepreneurs.  The value of bitcoin gives incentive to the whole ecosystem to build on top of it and use it, that will not happen to the same degree if the price goes to zero and/or the currency within the protocol is somehow compromised.

I think youre confusing usage of bitcoin with understanding bitcoin, its probably safe to say most rednecks dont understand how their online banking works, yet most people use online banking by now or understand how to use.  Its becoming easier and easier to use bitcoin, its now just becoming a question of confidence in the system.

i think there are many more of these type of people here in this community than we would like to admit, a lot of people, who regardless of everyones advice to be modest has put all of their savings etc into bitcoin.  Some people think its crazy I think it shows peoples faith in this is great and has overcome their fear of the unknown, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.  When one truly believes in something there is always a bit of a leap of faith, id like to think that this idea over the greed factor is what is driving people to do this.

In this economy everything is high risk, where should he keep his savings?  In dollars- being devalued on an enormous scale... in bonds-yeilds have just reversed a thirty year downtrend, the stock market- inflated highs due to QE and an obvious correction is coming soon, real estate- another highly inflated market due to free credit with people at the top.  Bitcoin is starting to look more and more like the safer bet, along with gold and silver, keeping his money in the established forms of savings are much more risky in my opinion.  The context that this comment was written in is in the context that there are safer investments out there.  I would like to mention i have done the same thing, most of my savings are in Bitcoin and PMs i dont see a safer investment right now in the western economy, another good investment would be to move out of the transatlantic region because shits about to hit the fan.

I can give you a list of about 20 alt coins that thought the same thing but look how far that has got them, the net effect of bitcoin is powerful, edit: and any competitive move another crypt currency make can also be incorporated into bitcoin to make itself more competitive,
sorry you were late to the boat man a lot of us have built bitcoin to what it is today and you're not just going to come here when the price is looking good and we are getting great press and just try and say you have some "great ideas for bitcoin to go mainstream"  we are going mainstream without your statist ideas sorry bud

mining is a huge gamble right now unless there becomes a solid mining company out there that is consistent with a great product it will continue to be one
take cointerra for instance they look like a solid company with solid investors and a solid dev team, but they still wont deliver until december they started taking pre orders in august so thats three months that theyre holding 14,000 of my dollars for equipment that hasn't even be created yet, 
a lot can happen in three months including but not limited to a huge spike in difficulty and the 'real' market is looking unstable right now so i dont want to send my money away for that long, and with more efficient asics coming to the market, the difficulty percentages will only increase from their current level

this is such a scam i can't believe the quark-offs have infiltrated our sub and are trolling.  If you think your coin is so valuable then make your own subreddit.  Faggots

Zerocoin and namecoin are interesting, i doing think namecoin will ever be worth a over a trillion in market cap though.  Zerocoin has that potential if bitcoin does not implement something similar.

i think his partial ownership of coinbase (potential multibillion dollar company) would be of more significance

Henry Blodget is a douche.  How do you value any internet company such as google, Facebook, there are ways to value bitcoin.

digging through garbage dumps and scanning old hard drives from the early adoption era will replace hunting for gold near sunken pirate ships.

that interview made me cringe,
yes i understand what these companies are forced to do in order to do something like the atm. but to be excited about compliance and palm scans, is a bit unsettling for me.  Also thinking one is a "hero" for being a glorified government snitch is a bit naive, and bordering on Stockholm Syndrome

I disagree the wording in their statement "LR" could be replaced easily with "Bitcoin Exhanged" in every instance.  I understand that Bitcoin is not an institution but unless the peer to peer exchanges get up and running soon the exchange will continue to be a vulnerable part of the economy

i think we should all stop downplaying this, china is the largest emerging economy, this is about the third or four time volume in china has surpassed the volume at the western exchanges in the past couple of months.  When only less than a year ago China was completely irrelevant in the discussion.

It is so young and has so much potential not just as a currency but as a protocol a place for innovation and creativity. It truly is priceless. This will change everything just like the internet did, and pricing bitcoin now is the same as trying to put a price on the internet before tcp/ip

With the network speed increase and the current price run up bitcoin is looking as strong as ever.  Love watching this baby grow up.

This condescending boot licker just loves talking about compliance to these protectionist bureaucrats.  News flash bitcoin is worldwide and a few slimy regulators here in america aren't going to stop the movement.  I dont see how anyone can be so infatuated with compliance that they base their whole life education and start a blog on it. I'm sick of this guys shitty perspective.

No one knows when a good time to invest is because no one knows exactly what the market is going to do, the 'potential' upside for bitcoin is still great.  I would recommend doing research and to not trying to time the market because thats usually a losing game

I understand that bitcoin can be strictly used as a payment processor, but 40k a coin is not bizarre, and is actually a very low ball estimate compared to many other well established Venture Capitalists and Wall Street Investors' estimates, who give reasons to back their value propositions, not vague remarks on reddit.  Yes we've heard this song before bitcoin is volatile so is every other new investment on the planet that doesn't have a lot of liquidity.  Second market is basically the pre-show before bitcoin is headed to the big time.  To say bitcoin is being used what it was 'intended for' as a payment processor strictly for competition to paypal or western union  is laughable and there are plenty of quotes from the creator to prove my point.
