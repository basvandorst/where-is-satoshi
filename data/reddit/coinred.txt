The coins are produced to a given amount of time.
Only so many coins are available per unit of time.
So more dummies are produced to "kill time" 
If everyone(collective) put in 1MW worth of computational and electric power they would get the same out as if they put in 1GW in relation to the number of bitcoins produced.

if a smaller entity mined the bitcoins and distributed them by some method then the security wouldnt change but the coins would be produced with a lot less power..surely??

what is the minimum amount of electricity needed to have the bitcoins produced
compared with
how much electricity is being used to produce the bitcoins.
The number of bitcoins being produced is CONSTANT
The electricity being used to get that constant is VARIABLE

to my studies (correct or incorrect) the difficulty factor is only to keep the coins being mined at a constant rate ie so many coins per unit of time.
 The coins could be all mined for far less electricity if there was a method of sharing them .

Forgetting collusion and other nasties for a moment, could all the bitcoins be produced using far less electricity?

The coins are produced according to TIME, so many coins in 10 minutes.
Therefore mining difficulty is just a product of the number of miners.
ie 10 coins in a raffle,
 if 10 enter the raffle using 200 watts of electricity each the difficulty level is made low.
if 200 000 enter the raffle using 2000 watts of electricity each the chances of winning the raffle is lower so the difficulty is higher.
The more miners or hash rate just uses tons more electricity to get the same amount of coins.

my post was more a point than a question..
 I see what you are saying but the amount used still seems way too much.
thx for comments....

every one vote for Satoshi to be this small entity so the coins could be produced using far less electricity and then Satoshi couls probably conjure a means of sharing them outsome energy efficient way..
