Do you mean that you will buy BitCoins, sell BitCoins, or both?
@_date: 2011-07-26 13:18:14
Yes, but it didn't have to be *him*. Ideally, you'd want everyone else to spend and raise the value, while you hoard. It's a tragedy-of-the-commons-type situation.

That's assuming they either don't fall, or that you sell them in time if they do.

"Another"? Has there been a (confirmed) case of a Bitcoin trader doing that?

"Sell, then regret it" is, I believe, the motto of every single *successful* speculator.

Man, those sheeple, eh?

Sure, even a matryoshka of three FreeBSD virtual machines and five TrueCrypt partitions running on a dedicated computer behind fifteen firewalls is *potentially* hackable.
But to say "oh well, I'll just give all my money to \*random website\* instead"? Madness. Madness and stupidity.

Isn't it obvious? The early adopters accumulated a lot of BitCoins when the exchange rate was low and/or mining was easy. *Then* the hype gets started, the value of BitCoin rises exponentially on speculation alone - fueled by the late 'chumps' who buy bitcoins at 5-20 USD apiece - and (some of) those early adopters cash out. Everybody else gets fucked as BC fails to actually become a valid currency and its value crashes [of course, if BC does *not* crash then the whole comparison doesn't work].
It's not *strictly* a pyramid because the early adopters still have to cash out in time, but when an asset's value rises exponentially and then crashes, the behaviour of its investors is remarkably similar to that of a pyramid scheme (late buyers' money ends in the early buyers' pockets).

An encrypted USB key works better for that.

[Fort Knox](
Mount Gox
That's as far as I can guess. I don't know if "gox" has a particular meaning, or why they didn't stick with "fort", but it might have to do with the difficulty of finding an available domain that short.

The size of your pool doesn't affect the size of your returns, only their variance. You get smaller rewards, but you get them more often. (Changes in difficulty factor are another matter entirely.)

How can you tell that it's a price that should rise, held down by a big sell order  as opposed to a price that should fall, held up by a big buy order

Re: spillover
If I understand correctly what you're talking about, you have two options on Mtgox: "dark pool and normal" and "dark pool only". The latter shouldn't allow spillovers.

Student housing -&gt; flat energy bill -&gt; infinite ratio here :)
(Although I should count the slight increased chance of a GPU or PSU failure, but both should come off as negligible)

Who said you have to keep the whole 20 kBTC wallet loaded in the client?
(And even if you did so, hoping the BTC client to be utterly and completely bug-free, it would *still* be orders of magnitude safer than entrusting all your money to an anonymous operator like MyBTC.com)
