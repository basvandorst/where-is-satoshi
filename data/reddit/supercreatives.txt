Check the bitcoin ATM right by our entrance!
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:33:43
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:32:52
Yeah very good point...we will look into this as someone else mentioned above. Can’t see why not because we do a low number of transactions daily and can easily update our stock manually when we sell stuff!
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:54:54
I get you. Ok that will be phase two. Thanks for the heads up, only just figuring this out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:39:00
Cool thanks :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:25:53
Oh just realised we have a $100 transaction limit daily...oh well we never sell that much anyway haha!
Applied to lift it, should take 2-4 days. Bitpay seems a great service!
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:49:30
What do you mean? We can open a bitcoin wallet for the shop but I haven't figured out the detail of accounting for that right now. I use bitcoin myself and we even have a bitcoin ATM here in store :D
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:12:54
I like it. Be happy :)
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:37:26
Yeah sorry should have edited that.

BTC Levels was a binary options site - it allowed you to trade (i.e. gamble upon) movements in the price of Bitcoin. 
They based the whole thing on integration with MtGox...not on the price of Bitcoin 'market-wide'.
The MTGox episode would have destroyed their entire business and any trades in progress on the site.

Mobile app coming soon. Live now on Fancy.com though!

Pay by credit card is temporarily off while they fix it apparently. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 09:07:38
It makes me feel we are doomed to keep repeating the mistakes of the past.
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:10:44
See pic

This is great news. Casinos are moving on it too.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:44:01
Ok I'm signed up for updates. It sounds good. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 09:10:48
Taking a look now. Thanks lots of good links being shared.
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:02:46
Wildly speculating is my favourite kind of speculating.
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:06:29
This is good thinking. Take bitcoin and make it consumable in the simplest possible manner.
@_date: 2015-01-29 11:39:28
Haha ok sorry :D
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:48:20
How about giving some bitcoin to Skateistan - 
Thanks :D
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:20:32
I mean you can't tell them apart until you scan them. Which means there is potential for confusion. Sometimes speaking to Bitcoin people is like speaking to the Borg.
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:15:43
Harsh but fair :D
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:36:42
Hey I'm the public and I don't accept it. If I can't read the address I just pasted into my wallet, how am I going to notice if it's the right one or not when I'm making multiple payments?
It needs work for sure. Not acceptable the way things are.
@_date: 2015-01-29 09:14:59
Ok I have one big problem with QR codes - I can't read them.
This means when I click a QR code I have to trust 100% that it is what I am being told it is. I mean, if I took out two cards one with a QR code for my bitcoin wallet, and one with a QR code for Evil Corporation X's bitcoin wallet...how do you tell them apart?
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:23:40
Update -&gt; this looks good 
@_date: 2015-01-29 09:25:54


Yeah ok...just did a little bit of googling about what the hell a two way peg is...and that sounds good.
In case I got this wrong... it sounds like some kind of ghost bitcoin could be created at the point of transaction. Say for example you make a transaction to a new person, the deal has to be double confirmed before the coins transfer. 
So I send 100BTC to a new address, the 100BTC leave my account and become ghost bitcoins on a sidechain, the new address owner accepts the transaction and I receive a confirmation message - as soon as I confirm the transaction is legit, the ghost bitcoins are burnt and the real BTC appear in the recipient's wallet. If I don't confirm the ghost bitcoins burn and my 100BTC goes back in my wallet.
May only be necessary for new transactions to unknown addresses.
How I think it might work after a very quick scan of this: 
Now tell me what I got wrong :D
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:09:40
More likely Apple Pay.
@_date: 2015-01-29 10:43:57
Ok now this is what I wanted to hear! I like Multibit a lot. Great news. 
Am I alone in thinking that the development of user friendly wallets will do more for adoption than all the new exchanges that keep appearing?
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:20:14
100BTC (or equivalent) is not nerve wracking at all when I do a transfer from one of my accounts to another, or to human readable account details that I have stored, or even to a new bank account when I have the assurance that the transaction is reversable should I really balls things up.
But with bitcoin...it's scary.
I do understand that things can be built on the protocol that can make it easier for idiots like me. I just wish they were a bit more developed already and I wish I knew where to find them.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:33:22
I'll be watching and waiting...
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:52:01
Like totally.
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:25:54
But nobody knows who owns the majority of Bitcoin...or who invented it. How can a government accept that kind of loss of control? Satoshi could be anyone...he could be an Islamist terrorist, a Rothschild, an extra terrestrial or any number of characters that strike fear into the hearts of the political class.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:51:43
Yeah I know this...but I don't know who Satoshi is. If he was to come forward and make himself known to the US government (maybe he already has?) then maybe they could work things out and everything would be sweet.
@_date: 2015-01-29 09:17:13
This is funny, but worthless.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:52:13
Just pay the tax. Assuming you live in a country that provides public services, provides education, law and order etc...pay the tax. You're still doing ok. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:39:39
Can’t get this to work using HTLC.me keeps saying ‘Send Payment Failed’.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:50:03
Can someone just build the instagram clone where likes cost one satoshi and are paid directly to the content creator already?
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:59:46
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:49:01
Trezor and Multibit.
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:33:33
Cool. Much respect and thanks for answering.
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:32:59
All hail the mighty fork.
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:50:57
Thanks that makes sense. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:50:26
Got it thanks
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:34:36
Publicity stunt for Campus Society which is just another pointless and doomed niche social network.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:09:37
Bitcoin whales trying to wreck Bakkt? Will this cost Bakkt big?
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:23:38
This is big because the Aussie government just made online gambling illegal...payment providers for AU$ casinos like Visa and Paypal will refuse transactions...bitcoin won't.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:25:46
So you're gonna sell your BTC at $1000 and wait for the price to drop so you can buy more?
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:31:25
I'm not sure if you're serious or not, but you have clearly never worked for Government.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:28:19
Because $$$ is more fun to spend than BTC
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:31:09
That seems really smart. I will do the same.
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:59:45
I know that guy - he used to work for an online casino. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 10:06:24
This is brilliant! As soon as micro payments like this are able to be used to reward influencers on social media by attributing a real cash value to likes and comments we will have reached the end goal!
Made my day :D
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:31:41
Yeah I agree it’s still great to use...and I also agree I’m not sure what it should be worth but the instability does mean you can’t keep funds held in btc for any amount of time and retain the same exchange value. Stability would be good...but we have to find the price first.
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:51:25
Waiting for the comments that signal time to buy! 
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:46:05
Who needs an excuse? I don’t understand.
