Frankly, if it was paid I'd do it. Not out of greed, but I simply can't afford to take 12 weeks off of work. I love this concept.

Nice work being on top of it.

Do you have to travel there from where you are back and fourth? 
@_date: 2016-08-17 05:26:56
Thought you needed to move there. Frankly I'm going to look into this now.

I suppose what I was getting at is hopefully you're in no danger of legal problems, arrest, etc while you're there. That's just what I hope you avoid when all's said and done.

Sorry to hear that man. Will this be an ongoing issue for you?
@_date: 2016-04-14 08:44:37
Be well dude. Best of luck on your next venture, if you haven't started one already.
@_date: 2016-04-13 12:06:00
Hope you get to stay way the hell away from there.

I'm guessing you don't like sharing your social profile info? You'd rather be anonymous?

Next only to Zapchain you guys are my favorite way to earn Bitcoin. I was a noob up until a couple months ago and learned real fast about how not to get burned by wasting time with faucets or giving my Bitcoin to fly by night "investment" companies that promise 10% return. Thanks for your service!

Has anyone paid out for this event? Has anyone gotten a refund?

Looks like the website got taken down

I've found them largely reliable overall. When I lost my old phone, it was a bitch to get my new phone setup, but I thought that process was sort of built in for my benefit to keep bad guys from messing with my funds.

I managed to save a bit without thinking about it, so I wouldn't call it awful personally.

He said very clearly that he doesn't take it lightly at all.

I can't speak for them, but I believe their plans are for expansion internationally, so that includes Europe. Stay tuned.

OK, I understand what you're saying, but I want to ask you - do you agree with his assessment of the overall impact of Segwit vs. HF or not? 
@_date: 2016-03-16 05:54:59
It's a collective responsibility, is it not? He's a miner, so he certainly bears a share of the burden either way along with the rest of the community. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:00:09
Sucks man. I empathize. But try to be patient, if you can.

Holding my breath to see what happens from Seoul.

Trying to find the next rising tide so I can be a "normal" 38 year old in 7 year's time and be chillin' like you. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:07:10
This is brilliant! I want to go there! 
@_date: 2016-09-29 12:30:12
I was gonna say this.

If the dollar amount was the same and I could pay BTC or cryptocurrency equivalent then absolutely.

Loved the last one. Awesome.
