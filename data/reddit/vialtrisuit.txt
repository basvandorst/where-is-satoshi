Stop projecting.


How much of the protocol do you own when you buy a bitcoin?


That doesn't mean it has inherent value. You can use cowshit as a medium of exchange if you want, doesn't mean cowshit has inherent value.


Lol. You can also use imaginary unicorns as a unit of accounting. Does that mean imaginary unicorns have inherent value? You're so dumb it hurts.


But it's not a store of value. Because it has no inherent value. Only things that actually have value are things you can use to store value.


Sure, anything can be considered money. Doesn't mean it has value. A dollar bill is considered money, but a dollar bill doesn't have any inherent value.


Yes it is pretty clear that you are a retard when it comes to basic economics. You clearly know nothing.

I know. Also you could have just linked the wikipedia page instead of copying it. Still have no idea what your point is?
Do you know that the subjective theory of value is not the only theory of value? I mean, I happen to subscribe to the subjective theory of value which makes it all the more confusing what the fuck your actual point is...?

... You guys realize it's a bubble right?

First of all, why fiat currencies fail have nothing to do with the fact that Bitcoin is a bubble.
And secondly I know why fiat currencies fail, mainly because they don't actually have any real value. And neither does Bitcoin.

I mean bitcoin is basically fiat. A bitcoin doesnt have any inherent value. 
Also the dollar and euro etc are losing value, not exactly a bubble.

 &gt; Diamonds are an example of the brainwashing tecniques ccoporations use to sell you useless shit that its actually VERY cheap.
So what? Also diamonds aren't useless, diamonds are used for all sorts of industrial purposes and they look nice.


Yes, it's called inflation. So what? 


I am familiar. However, as usual I have no idea what point you're trying to make.

What on earth are you talking about? The internet has inherent value and things on the internet can have inherent value.
Also, you know, the internet isn't a currency?


Economic value. There is no inherent economic value in Bitcoins. Just like there is no inherent value to a paper bill with $100 written on it.
I mean, if we're not talking economic value sure. I think Bitcoin has huge comedic value considering the hilarious shitshow that will ensue when the bubble bursts. 
But hey, don't listen to me. Honestly I think you should take out some loans to invest in Bitcoin, the interest rate being 0 and all.


You know nothing about basic economics.

Because they have properties that people have a demand for.
I mean, if I need to explain why rare earths have inherent value this clearly isn't going anywhere interesting.
