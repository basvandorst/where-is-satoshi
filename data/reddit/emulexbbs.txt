You didn't answer the mining question but since you said "cheap coins", I am quite certain you don't mine and none of this actually applies to you.
Merchants routinely refuse to accept stolen credit cards. In kidnapping ransom cases, serial numbers of bills are often recorded and tracked. Heck, we still know which bills DB Cooper jumped with.
You and I differ in that I believe this is a toy for the geeks. It not for investment, thats just silly. Spend those coins, before they are worth nothing. They will eventually be worth nothing once the mining stops.

I've been watching for months and finally decided to question the general flow here. Its like religious fanaticism. It doesn't matter if you are technically correct if it questions faith in the allmighty coin.

Sorry to say, powerful, plentiful free energy will change a lot more than bitcoin will. But thanks for showing me how powerful that koolaid is.

Awe touched a nerve calling the investors fools. I like solving ciphers with pencils, yes I'm very limited but very logical. Enjoy your trinkets, sorry I mean coins, no wait investments. Proof of work? Yah.

All the talk seems to want to kick the can down the road and hope the transaction volume will be high enough to make up for the loss of block reward. So when I say no one wants to talk about it, I guess I mean no one wants to face reality. Lots of people believe Jesus is coming back too, doesn't mean its realistic.

Too many fools, sorry I mean "investors" hoping to get rich on here and can't see the bigger picture. 
No, absolutely not. It is not a good thing they are controlling 26,000 coins.
Bitcoin is a fun toy for the next few years but it wil eventually fail due to block chain size and the whole "who will process transactions when all the coins are mined" problem. No one seems to talk about that, lets just kick the can down the road. Silly kids.

There is no good outcome to the govt controlling those coins. They will either be used for stings or they will cash them out and cause a price drop. Do you even mine?

Do you actually believe bitcoin is on par with the printing press? Something like superconducting or cold fusion would bring that level of change. Bitcoin's impact won't even be close to the items you've compared it to.

Heh. Well no, but there needs to be a devils advocate and there are very few here.

I've been thinking about that for two days. I fully support that idea. The coins *WILL* be used for stings to take freedom away from more people. 
Its a good precedent. We  should enforce the idea that coins are the property of the people. If they are seized by the government, they will be deactivated.
End of story.
