Steal as a person, go to jail.  Steal as a company, go bankrupt.

I do have a Japanese bank account.  I thought someone might know of an ATM or a business like the precious metal buyers at home here that also deal in Bitcoin.

Thanks Eric.  I guess I'm curious as to the details of that equilibrium mechanism..... Is it simply programmed into the difficulty adjustment algorithm?

The site will continue to exist for its other functions that were there before....so I don't think BTC withdrawals are going anywhere.
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:51:14
Merged mining?
@_date: 2014-05-28 02:40:21
No, different situation.  From my point of view, those actions support the opinion that criminals would rather keep value in the system and steal it than destroy the system.

"Regular basis" qualifier isn't needed. I agree that some people, me included, often but one off items from little known sites.  For those sites, credit card makes sense.  For the other sites like Newegg, BTC and its discount make sense.  I don't think you disagree with each other on this?
What's exciting for me is that in future, features like multi sig and escrow will add in buyer protection, with very little overhead/additional cost.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:00:15
Exactly.  Begging miners to leave is not going to work.  Providing an alternative will work.
@_date: 2014-03-13 08:09:06
I just tried via PC Financial and ING Direct.....VOGOGO removed from both.... *sigh*  Can you add a better option, or at least reduce the $50 fee for EFT?
@_date: 2014-06-14 06:01:30
I've incorporated it by doing the btc pages myself.  You could hire a coder to do this, cause I don't think it's hit many shopping cart programs yet.

What Newsweek did was reprehensible.  What the community will do in response will be heartwarming.  Nakamoto-san, please accept sincere apologies on my behalf (for what it's worth as a member of the community) and a sincere hope for peace for your family.

Did you try to copy and paste the password?  I've had a similar issue before due to a sticking shift key.

One theory is that the US pressures Japanese banks to block access to safety deposit boxes belonging to Mark as part of their efforts to shut down illicit SR activity, a la Charlie Shrem.  By essentially transferring control to the JP government, perhaps they are able to convince some banks to release the stored private keys.  This fits the "I have them but can't access them" story.
@_date: 2014-06-13 23:24:38
This should be at the top of every one if these threads along with an explanation of why a 51% attack that easily killed ASS-coin or some other alt of the week, isn't proof that it would destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:38:07
Yeah that makes sense to me.  How many hardware iterations do you think we have left in the bag? How does this play out afterwards?
@_date: 2014-05-28 02:22:35
I feel that the hash rates to take on Bitcoin are so high in comparison to the alt coins that we can depend on selfish interests to actually prevent such attacks.  Time will tell I'm sure.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:04:14
I'm not sure the last commenter gets it...
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:35:48
To be fair, top result on Google doesn't mean much. Blockchain has scammers game Google all the time.
@_date: 2014-04-09 06:18:22
Of course they did this.  It's such an obvious thing to do with such a high reward.  I'd need proof they didn't do this, based on Occam's Razor alone.  
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:59:25
Agreed. I wouldn't put it out of the realm of possibility that Nick Szabo had Satoshi help him code his idea, and that Nick wrote the paper itself.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:05:16
Exactly. They will Walmart the shit out of the market rather than Apple themselves into a corner.
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:40:51
You posted this twice with two of your accounts?
@_date: 2014-03-13 08:10:02
I just tried via PC Financial and ING Direct.....VOGOGO removed from both.... sigh Can you add a real EFT option?

... Other than trusting random strangers on the street cash
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:08:50
I am so happy!  Thanks you Andreas!  Seeing Dorian get some sort of happiness out of this is the best feeling I've had from donating to something in a long time.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:25:26
Exactly. That's not fraud, it's theft, which it a completely different problem.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:34:39
That's a good question for Prof. Szabo.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:05:30
Yup.  Used one in Canada.  The fees suck so it's only good in a pinch.
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:31:06
Or provide a market where there is healthy competition

He's trying to not say "you are right, I was wrong" - can't you let him keep up the charade? ;-P
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:09:24
upvote this guys - it is solid evidence that the leaked strategy is legit.  this means limited btc withdrawals starting sometime in april.
@_date: 2014-05-28 02:45:57
The alt coin evidence really only applies to alt coins I'd say.  Fewer resources and fewer individuals are required to be spent to destroy am alt coin with 51% attacks.  And reasons for such attacks could be as simple as destroying a competitor's coin to retain market share in some other coin.  I don't see that as a smart move with BTC, at the very least, it's not analogous enough to be considered evidence.
I appreciate the concern, because it's a possible risk, and a possibly fatal one.  I just don't see what financial benefit can come from destroying Bitcoin this way.  Sure you can make a case for destroying alt coins to protect market share, but investors in mining gear and funds alike would rather see the value grow than destroyed I would think.  
@_date: 2014-06-12 03:06:59
The qualifier "slowly" is sure poignant.  I also agree that the hardware must soon outpace existing tech.
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:13:33
Yup :(
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:07:21
I found out about  recently too, for my NA bronies.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:47:30
Yeesh, we know what he meant.  No need to start a Cartesian reduction.  He just means someone provided a very plausible explanation based on some blockchain data, but hasn't been proven or substantiated fully by someone with access inside gox.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:19:39
Exactly. Her story is as convincing as Dorian's denial, which means there is no evidence to speak of.
@_date: 2014-05-28 02:02:25
It's actually not that big of a deal, since they'd only get away with one block of mischief, and forever tarnish their reputation.  All of the profits from that block would be on their own fork which would become useless after the rest of the community ignored that fork and maintained the correct one.  Andreas does a better job of explaining why 51% isn't the biggest problem to worry about; essentially it would be biting the hand that feeds you.
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:33:44
That assumes the 51% attack is a surety.  I don't think it is.
@_date: 2014-03-14 00:20:54
An EFT option that doesn't cost me an arm and a leg would get my business from Cavirtex

Japan has a military.  They call it the "Self Defense Forces", and have quite the Navy as part of it.

Every example risk of loss and price fluctuation you give can be mitigated by the user.  The risk of Paypal freezing your funds cannot be mitigated by the use.

Yeah Rosa, just sit at the back and stay quiet, your complaining is annoying us.

He did also mention that someone's shorts will be filled, as in people will shit their pants....

It didn't fit the requirements for 17 letters
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:23:35
I don't logic your follow.
With Bitcoin, only valid transactions are executed (added to the block chain), any fraud happens off chain.  This is better because confirmations alone is enough to rule out the equivalent of a "faked check".
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:14:06
Yeah.... I'll likely just wire the money there in the end.  I guess it's not yet quite as prevalent as I want it to be. Someday though :)

I had been using QCX but they stopped the EFT's and now I'm stuck looking for a fee free way of getting my pennies in.
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:10:37
Uh..... That's what I'm trying to do.  But why not be innovative, maybe accept my bank's money orders and not just Canada Post. Maybe don't cancel my EFT, maybe accept Interac email money transfers. Do something different or don't call yourself the MOST CONVENIENT way of buying BTC.
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:08:24
I would like to be able to use EFT or INTERAC email money transfer, for example.

Three threads about the "logo"..... yeesh.
This is his personal branding, not the logo for his startup.  It's a play on "A"ndreas "M" and his signature buzzed head with receding hairline.
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:59:06
So you're saying there's a chance
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:35:42
There is actually a chance.
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:59:28

I've dubbed this type of affliction "white belt syndrome".  Is like they've joined a martial art, and suddenly feel like a martial killing machine.
@_date: 2015-11-25 02:24:49
It's used on websites because it's electronic. Much more illicit activity takes place in person with cash.

I see. That's misleading calling them all voters if they can't all vote.
@_date: 2015-02-15 03:04:57
I think it means 364 people successfully voted, so it's met.
