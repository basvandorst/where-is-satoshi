This story makes a lot more sense than the story they had been telling before.
1) So the thief got away with 2000 BTC. That's a lot more than $1000 worth of BTC at $17/BTC. That makes sense, because the huge selloff lowered the price, so the $1000/day limit was less meaningful.
2) They admit the database was compromised with a SQLi vulnerability that probably resulted in the username/password leak.
3) The former owner's admin account was compromised, and the thief edited the database to artificially create new BTC. This makes much more sense than the old story which was that someone had the ludicriously large quantity of 500,000 BTC in their account.

It actually used to be called Live Bitcoin Exchange Data, but after Mt Gox acquired them, they went back and time and changed it to Mt Gox Live, to make it look like this was planned all along.

People are going to continue to hoard them until they are fully invested. Only when they are fully invested does it make sense to actually spend them, because then they will have no choice but to spend them on their daily expenses. Otherwise, hoarding is better because the value keeps rising (on long scales... I realize the price has not exactly been skyrocketing recently), and then it's better to spend your inflating fiat currencies on daily expenses.

He asks, "what has changed?" as though bitcoins are identical to what came before. Then he asks, "why on earth make them expensive to create?" Not realizing this contradicts his earlier point that there is nothing new. Perhaps what is different about bitcoins is precisely what gives them their value.

Thanks for the link. The excerpt given contains this:


There is a very good reason why bitcoins are expensive to make. The process of making them also checks for cheaters. The computational power of mining is a way of abstracting away the process of policing cheaters. It is inevitable that people will try to game the system. Thus, we need police. The computers are the police, and your computer is one of them. Rather than being some kind of flaw in bitcoin, it is actually just an elegant way to police the system.

You have to analyze things yourself and come up with your own decision. You can't outsource your intelligence... that will always be unintelligent.
However, if it helps, my conclusion was to invest everything and then some, because I think bitcoin is going way, way up long term. But at the same time, i invested only what I was willing to lose (which in my case was everything... but I have a regular income so I will survive if I lose my investment).

I'm not being facetious. When I discovered bitcoin, I vaguely understood the Libertarian connection, but wanted to learn more. When talking about bitcoin with a friend, Ron Paul came up, and the Fed came up, and Ron Paul's book "End the Fed" came up. That book seemed relevant, so that's where I started. I was pretty convinced by Ron Paul's argument that the Fed should be ended since it does nothing but screw with the free market and serve as a mechanism to channel wealth from productive people to bankers. I then read a few of the references that Ron Paul listed, particularly "The Case Against the Fed" and "The Mystery of Banking" by Murray Rothbard, and also "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt. It became quite clear that the banking industry is not free market at all, but is a government enforced cartel. Suddenly, websites like lewrockwell.com started to make sense. When the government interferes with the market, it isn't helping things at all. It is just making things worse.
Libertarianism is about a lot more than banking, of course, but the basic idea that regulations often do more to serve special interests than the people almost certainly applies to every industry and not just banking, since the government is so easily corrupted. So I am now pro-small government, and even more pro-free market than I already was. So bitcoin made me Libertarian.
@_date: 2011-10-11 01:02:31
You can't really separate bitcoin from its libertarian influences. It's sort of the point. We shouldn't be surprised that anti-government types and drug dealers/sellers are the ones adopting it first, because they're the ones who need it most. The people who need it a little less will take a little longer to adopt it.
It's just like the internet. Porn was huge on the internet because it needed the anonymity. It took other industries, like music, many years to start taking advantage of the internet, because they didn't need it quite so bad.

@_date: 2011-05-24 16:48:59
I think this is a good idea. As of yesterday I have started working on a project to enable this kind of charity. It's called Bit Fund. Bit Fund will be like reddit, except with proposals rather than links, and bitcoins instead of upvotes. You post a proposal to Bit Fund, and your bitcoin address, and Bit Fund will display how many bitcoins have been given to that address. It does this by simply analyzing the block chain; Bit Fund will not itself receive or send any money. This will enable donors to know how much money the charities have received.

See my post, One Week of Trading Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2011-06-08 03:59:32
$22 doesn't make any economic sense except as the result of speculators creating the demand and sellers creating the supply. With only 6.5 million BTC at present, that's only 120 million USD, far smaller than, say, the amount of money in the drug economy. If bitcoins are actually used as a currency, all the bitcoins combined will easily be worth billions and probably trillions of USD.
Note that when people say they think the bubble will pop, they never give an explanation. But why would people's perceived value of bitcoin suddenly drop to nothing? This could happen if there was a flaw discovered in bitcoin. But no flaws have been found, and after a lot of research I think no flaws will be found, at least until quantum computers make its cryptography obsolete. Are there any other reason people's confidence would suddenly drop to nothing? I can't think of any. Even if the US made bitcoin illegal, all that would do is push the economy underground and to other countries; it would not drop the value to 0. Instead, it would merely prevent bitcoin from taking over the entire US economy. But of course it could still be enormously valuable without conquering the entire US economy.
So I think bitcoin will keep rising in value until the whole lot is worth trillions of USD. To get a more accurate value, you could try to figure out the nature of the economy that bitcoins will occupy in a few years. But the details don't really matter... what matters is they are going to keep going up in value. So now is the time to buy.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:23:11
Yes it looks like you're right. It was a hack after all.
@_date: 2011-07-13 14:10:02
Two skeptics thought that bitcoins will be worthless in 5 years, but they didn't give any reasons for that (of course they didn't have much time in a 20 minute podcast). But I don't think they realize the fundamental differences between bitcoin and every other kind of money that has ever existed. I bet they are just applying their schema that "new money, like e-gold, WoW gold, Liberty Dollars, etc., never works." But bitcoin is not like any of those, so if it fails, it won't be for the same reasons. And after studying the various failure scenarios, I am quite confident bitcoin won't fail. Instead, it will thrive, because the demand for something like this is enormous, and bitcoin itself fulfills 100% of the technical properties it needs to satisfy that demand.

As I mentioned elsewhere, what matters is clearly the cost of producing hashes. Good FPGAs are expensive. They are more expensive than graphics cards because the market is smaller. However, you may be right about their power usage. So the question is... is it actually cheaper to produce hashes with them, accounting for power usage and all that? Maybe, but I'd like to see some numbers on that.
@_date: 2011-05-27 21:31:29
First, I never said these things will make bitcoin successful. I said we will know bitcoin is successful when these things happen. Now, onto your points:
1) The bitcoin economy is being driven by speculators and curious people. This is what is getting bitcoin off the ground. This is making it possible for people to do business with bitcoins. That is happening in front of our eyes, right now, as we speak.
2) Yes, there is a reason why multiplayer games would use bitcoin: the infrastructure for moving bitcoins around already exists, and bitcoins would be more valuable than their in-game currency, and people would have bitcoins ready to use in their game, and people would be able to use the same currency in different games, etc.
3) Illegal uses of bitcoin will only be possible if it works as a currency, otherwise it would have no value to criminals, because they couldn't exchange it for anything. If criminals are using bitcoin, then evidently there are legitimate uses for it as well.
4) Yes, and people are already converting their assets into bitcoins.
5) Yes, it can and will happen and is already happening. And obviously this alone would not be enough to make bitcoin succeed... I never said that.
6) Again, I never said that this would make bitcoin successful. I said it would be a sign of bitcoin's success.

In a system of truly free market banking, whenever you transfer funds from one bank or another, the new bank is going to want the reserve funds, which are bitcoins in this case. Having many banks competing with one another thus enforces high reserve ratios on banks or they will become insolvent.
Of course, if there is only one giant bank, like mtgox, and no competitors, then they could definitely keep low reserves and use the rest for whatever they want.
For what it's worth, I think fractional reserve banking is a giant scam equivalent to counterfeiting. It should either be outlawed (by requiring 100% reserves), or if that is unenforceable, we should remove all regulations on banks so they will be forced by the market to keep reserves close to 100%, and then require any insolvent banks to immediately liquidate.

I think the answer is yes. The computational power of the miners is a way of abstracting away the difficulty of detecting cheaters. People like to say it's not "green" because it uses so much power. But that power is actually pretty much exactly what is required to prohibit cheaters, so in that sense it's not that expensive at all.

If I'm understanding what happened correctly, that buy order was not a smart bystander, but was actually the criminal who did the hacking.

I agree those are the most serious concerns. However, I don't think the US government actually can stop bitcoin - they will just drive it underground and to other countries. And FWIW, I don't think the US government will actually try to kill it, but we'll see.
An exploit would be more disastrous. If a flaw in the software enabled cheaters to steal private keys at will, that would definitely kill bitcoin and set any competitors back significantly due to the stigma. But if there were such a problem, it probably would have already been uncovered. So I think we are likely safe from this.

Well enough people have been hacked recently that I think it's pretty important we figure out how this is happening. I think yours is at least the third Mt Gox hacking I've heard of recently.
Does your password have numbers or special characters? Is it something that could be found if you Googled it? (i.e., it's not in any official dictionary, but it is in the internet-English lexicon.) Do you use the same password on other websites?
If your password was 8 characters or less it can be brute-forced. Or, if it has the entropy of an 8 character password or less (i.e., it's a ten-letter English word), then it can also be brute-forced.
However, usually you can only brute-force a password if you have access to the hash. That would mean Mt Gox itself had been compromised. It could also be that people are brute-forcing right on Mt Gox, indicating they have no protections in place to prevent brute-forcing. That is something they could easily fix by disabling password attempts after 10 tries or so.
The best way to avoid cracked passwords is to use a password manager. Your encrypted password file has one very long, randomly generated password which you memorize. All other passwords are long and complicated and you don't bother memorizing them. 
@_date: 2011-05-17 21:17:25
So let me get this straight. The button submits some special code in the "custom" field. There is some kind of flaw in the MtGox merchant page... I can't look at it, but presumably they don't escape the quotes. This enables this special code to actually be executed, which downloads some script from a non-MtGox website. I can't look at this code, but presumably what it does is override the behavior of the "submit" button so that when the user presses it, they submit, say, way more bitcoins than the number of bitcoins listed on the checkout. (The movie mentions "autosubmit", but I don't understand that part. It does seem like the user has to at least log in first.) This enables the merchant to pretend to charge say 10 BTC for an item, when really they are charging, say 100 BTC. The user does not know this until after they have made the payment.
So for now, it's not safe to use any websites that run MtGox code for checking out purchases. Also, it's disturbing that the browser runs the xss code, knowing it's insecure, but without giving any visible warning without looking at that log of errors.
@_date: 2011-05-22 22:33:47

Thanks for the response.


But if they were illegal, dumping them would also probably be illegal. So they would probably remain valuable, except that the bitcoin economy would go underground.


A security vulnerability in sha256 is pretty unlikely; it's about as likely as finding a vulnerability in the encryption tools used by all financial systems. But the bitcoin protocol itself... only time will tell. Certainly, bitcoins are already valuable enough that there ought to be huge pressure to break it, if it can be broken.


Indeed. But if the market succeeds, you probably won't have as many bitcoins as if you had just bought bitcoins.

I agree, except I actually can think of a reason they would switch to a gold standard: when people start using bitcoin and stop using fiat currencies, the only way fiat currencies will be able to avoid failure will be to go to a gold standard.

That's the only way they will be able to compete with bitcoin.

Here's another similar calculuation. My educated guess is that, so far, no one has spent more than a few hundred thousand USD buying bitcoins. It's easy to imagine people spending tens of millions of USD on bitcoins, in which case the price could conceivably rise accordingly and be worth on the order of $1000/BTC.

Your argument is a non-sequitur. You've lost faith in people, but instead of opting out of society, you are opting out of bitcoin. So you're either a troll spreading FUD, or you haven't thought this through. I'll assume the latter. If you think it through, you'll realize that while the problem of trust holds for the bitcoin economy, it also holds for the non-bitcoin economy. Fortunately, with bitcoin, there is much less trust required for the currency itself. The whole point of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust any third parties to use it, unlike dollars. So if you have a problem with untrustworthy people, then you should be more willing to use bitcoin, not less.

I'm very uncertain about the near term price of bitcoin. Since there still isn't a very substantive bitcoin economy, the only thing holding the price at any particular value is the whim of people buying and selling. If a few holders panic sell, they drive the price down. If a few newbs mania buy, they drive the price up.
Overall I see the price dropping further still, in the near term, until something gives more people a reason to buy. But I could easily be wrong about that.

It's not a bubble. Buying bitcoins is no different from investing in a company that doesn't yet have enough revenue to cover its expenses. The speculation on bitcoins is necessary to put money into the bitcoin economy to encourage the development of businesses, just like investing in a company with no revenue is often necessary so the owners can buy the stuff they need to make money.

It seems as absurd to me as it does to you. But that is the inevitable conclusion I draw from the facts.

Yeah, that chart should definitely make everyone very very scared to hold dollars. If I had any substantive wealth at all, I would hold almost no dollars, and put everything in gold, silver and bitcoins. Right now I'm taking the riskier, but possibly higher reward position of being 100% bitcoins.
Edit: I would also add that you're talking about bitcoins being worth minimum $1000/BTC in today's dollars. But monetary base is still increasing rapidly and is likely to continue increasing rapidly over the next few years. Then if you do the same calculation, you'll see they are worth $2000/BTC minimum... but only because the dollar will be worth half as much.

Probably the best way to use and store bitcoins is to just use the "official" client, available at bitcoin.org. This client creates a file called wallet.dat that contains the private keys (i.e. passwords) to your bitcoin addresses. You need to save that file if you want to keep access to your bitcoins. Unfortunately, the client doesn't (yet) encrypt the private keys, so you need to encrypt the wallet.dat file yourself using something like truecrypt. Otherwise anyone who gets the file can steal your bitcoins.

I don't know, but you're completely right. Seems to me one of the great benefits of bitcoin is that you don't need to trust people with your bitcoins, especially not anonymous entities like MyBitcoin. Keep your bitcoins yourself. Encrypted and backed up. You have nothing to gain from using a bitcoin bank, because they can't provide any services you couldn't just run yourself on your own computer.

If $10,000 is too much, then wait two years and the price will be $5,000. Also, if bitcoin got this big, that means basically everyone is using it, and that means there would be a big incentive to create specialized hardware for bitcoin nodes, and that means they would be cheap.

If you don't understand technology, and you don't understand currencies, then the only reason I think you would buy bitcoins right now is to buy drugs.
However, when the economy is more developed, you'll want some bitcoins for when you use the internet for the same reason you'll want Euros when you go to Europe: it's what people take, so it's what you'll need.
Also, for someone who is that clueless, I would recommend they learn about technology and about currencies so they can appreciate bitcoin. And if they don't have any interest in that, then they are hopeless.

No. For small transactions you will be willing to accept bitcoins with 0 confirmations. For large transactions, you will be willing to wait a while for several confirmations. Putting everyone on the same centralized e-wallet service defeats the purpose of bitcoin, which is decentralization.

That's like 45 billion BTC. Quite a lot.
Edit: You can also clearly see the advantage of decentralized bitcoin when looking at the chart of vendor incompatibilities. All of the services only work with some of the relevant third parties. But with bitcoins, all you need is the phone software (which already exists for Android) and the merchant software, and there is no third party you have to get support from.

I agree with you. I just think it's important to be measured and reasonable in how we analyze bitcoin. Some people (e.g., the guy at links.org) have launched rhetorical assaults on bitcoin.

We'll know bitcoin is successful when:
1) Bitcoin is widely used for products and services you buy on the internet. (Small merchants will love bitcoin... no hassle setting up merchant accounts or dealing with paypal!)
2) Bitcoin is used as the digital currency in all multiplayer games.
3) Bitcoin is widely used for money laundering, and other illegal/illicit activities.
4) People use it to put their savings in because it is deflationary and gives a better return than US dollar savings accounts.
5) It is widely use for tipping people on the internet.
6) People like being paid in it because they can easily avoid taxes.
I do not see bitcoin being used, at least not soon, for:
1) Buying things at stores, restaurants, etc. IRL. (Credit cards haven't replaced cash for me, and I don't see bitcoins replacing credit cards or cash.)
That's all I can think of... basically, as commerce moves more and more to the internet, we'll see bitcoins become widely used in the digital economy (possibly replacing the use of other currencies). But I don't see any reason bitcoins will be used IRL... cash and credit cards already got that covered.

Every website? What about Chinese, Russian, or Iranian websites? You probably haven't ordered from such websites, because you can't with a credit card or paypal. But you will be able to with bitcoin.
Also, there are lots of reasons to use bitcoins over credit cards. Having 0 risk of having your card signed up for some hidden monthly fee, or having your info stolen, or even just having your info guarded insecurely like in the case of Sony. With bitcoin, no one can charge your account. You pay when you want. (Sometimes, there are good reason to give someone the ability to charge you automatically. That technology can be developed on top of bitcoin, but hasn't been yet.)
There are also advantages to bitcoin over paypal. Not having your account frozen at their whim is probably reason  The fees are also cheaper.

I agree that the finiteness of bitcoins is a bit odd. It's worth noting, however, that bitcoins are actually divided down to 8 decimal places, so there is actually something silly like 21 quadrillion different units that can be traded. (But the GUI doesn't presently support this even though the protocol does.)
Also, I think it makes sense that the first big decentralized currency is finite. That just makes it valuable, and thus kickstarts the digital currency revolution, because everyone who has some has an incentive to make it popular. If there is a market for having another currency that isn't limited to 21 million total, then such a currency could be constructed. It could be based off of bitcoin, but have different economic properties. If this other currency were better than bitcoin, then it could acquire a larger economy.
@_date: 2011-06-16 19:04:54


Deflation is not a problem. The number of monetary units is irrelevant.

He assumes people won't buy 50-core computers to run their own nodes, but I think he's wrong. People buy washing machines, furnaces, air conditioners, etc., for their homes, which cost thousands of dollars. A 48-core computer costs roughly $10,000 (and will obviously be cheaper by the time bitcoin is this big). I don't think a $10k computer in addition to all your other appliances is an unreasonable expense to ensure your independence from banks.
You might think that you would have to upgrade this computer every year, but once bitcoin has reached VISA-level transactions, its rate of growth will have slowed significantly, and thus the same powerful computer may last for several years as a bitcoin node.

The safest way to secure your bitcoins is just to have an entirely separate computer whose sole purpose is to store and send bitcoins (receiving bitcoins doesn't even require having a computer). On that computer, your wallet should be encrypted and only accessible with a password. It should be backed up, in encrypted form, somewhere that is physically separate from your computer.
