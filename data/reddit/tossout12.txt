You want to pay interest from donations?
That is the best business model ever!

If a single person can own 10% of the entire economy, the whole design and protocol is fundamentally flawed anyway.

That's the "laundering service" kdoto mentioned.
If you rely on a "trusted 3rd-party", sooner or later you will lose either your cash or your privacy.
For the OP: no. Either it is verifiable to prevent fraud, or it is anonymous.

That's him, over there.

You could just compare the difficulties; NC difficulty is 0.04051 * BTC difficulty.
Mine BTC, buy NC.

Selling BTC is no different than selling widgets.
There are fraudsters on ebay; news at 11.

This cant be true; the IDs in their referral spam are already 5 digits.

You dont have to own the computers.
botnet, bored sysadmin, lots of possibilities.

Create 2^N throw-away accounts.
One half predicts it will rise, the other half predicts it will fall.
Discard the half which was incorrect.
Rinse, repeat.

Anyone using this has an email which is probably compromised already, and has not already changed their password.
Now it is a race.
@_date: 2011-06-21 23:22:43
It certainly seems that way looking at some of the BT forums.
@_date: 2011-06-21 01:49:21
at any point, really.
And not just BTC exchanges.
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:17:29
My point exactly; there is no point disposing of the 'old' economy only to replace it with exactly the same problems. (Except worse, instead of the top 1%, now you have the top 1 person.)
BTC is a good attempt, but not enough to "overthrow the system".
@_date: 2011-06-21 23:49:53
One minor mistake in this article is that it claims the "1 account with 500k BTC" would need a short password to be cracked.
You dont need the original password, any password which generates the same hash will do.

The exchange logs + the block chain and there goes a big chunk of the anonymity.
I'm sure a few people would be interested.

There is a world of difference between a $1 -&gt; $0.97 change and a $0.01 -&gt; $20 change due to speculators.
Tulip bulbs are stable if you keep them in a cool-room, but you dont see me putting my life savings in that either.

If you had 1/12 of the bitcoins, would you put them *all* in mtgox in one go?
Even if you planned to sell them slowly, surely you would transfer them as needed, or sell through multiple exchanges.
Eggs &amp; baskets etc.
How does 1 person acquire that many bitcoins, but have no common sense?

Years ago there was a dude who gave sound conservative advice on a stock market forum I used to monitor. He did it for several years that I know of, probably more.
Gradually a lot of people started to trust him.
Then one day he pulled a massive pump &amp; dump, and left the country.
At no point should you trust any one person or company beyond the current transaction.
@_date: 2011-06-22 11:04:41
You're kind of right.
Half-arsed approaches like this without a deep understanding of the problem only provide a false sense of security.
There are techniques for securely splitting a file into X parts, so that the original is only recoverable if you have Y parts.
