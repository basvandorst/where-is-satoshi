There is not enough Bitcoin in the world, people start to realize this, it soon becomes impossible to dump this coin, if they start, there are plenty of buyers, 50k-100k-1 mill. here we come.

Good projects are been dragged down by the digital gold. The good altcoins need to decouple from this dinosaur. OR the the best altcoins will drag Btc up

BTC at 8000, far too much. Almost no utility, only thing is the 'digital gold' narrative, how long will that last?? Lightning network is a joke! Volume at $100 000  per day after years in progress?

A quality technical site (investtech) that has been right all the time: Automatic technical analysis. Long term, Dec 8, 2018Bitcoin has broken the falling trend channel down in the long term. This signals an even stronger falling rate. The stock has support at 440 and resistance at 6500. Negative volume balance indicates that sellers are aggressive while buyers are passive, and weakens the stock. The RSI curve shows a falling trend, which supports the negative trend. The stock is overall assessed as technically negative for the long term.Recommendation one to six quarters: Negative (Score: -87). My comment: No real support until $440, then $220
