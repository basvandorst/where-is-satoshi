Yep, you got it. There are a lot of delusional people here who think that because Bitcoin was something new, it's not bound by reality and the price can only go up, up, up!
NYTimes said it best:

No, they can reach zero if people abandon the platform entirely or jump to a better-designed currency. It can most definitely reach zero, even if the coins still exist.

I didn't miss the point at all, I was seguing into the current state of BTC versus that quote from 18 years ago.

If you're in it for the long haul, then this current bubble doesn't affect you in the slightest, so no worries.

Schiff is known for his...well, let's say non-optimistic views of American currency, economy, etc. Or, to put it more bluntly, his nickname is "Dr. Doom."
Yes, he predicted the housing bubble in 07, but so did many other economists and investors (Most of Goldman-Sachs were shorting the market as they knew it was going to crash).
For an opposing (non-Austrian school) viewpoint:


Krugman's response:

Bitcoin won't straight-up die off after this, but this kind of rapid, unsustainable growth will be followed by a major crash, and it's going to take some time to repair that damage.

A currency without a wildly fluctuating value?
I'm not trying to be a smart ass, but how are national chain businesses supposed to accept BTC when the value quadruples (or falls by the same amount) in a month? How do they label things for cost in the store when the cost would be changing daily, if not hourly? And how do you process returns for small quantity items, bottle deposits, etc.?
Say a customer buys 2 pomegranates at $2 USD each, and both turn out to be rotten. If they go back to the store, they get $4 USD back, regardless of how the Euro or Yen is doing.
But BTC right now is still heavily tied to those fiat currencies in terms of intrinsic worth. If the price of BTC is $150 USD when they go to the store, then they'd cost somewhere around 0.1333 (repeating) BTC. So what happens when later in the same day, the price is now $130 USD per coin. Does the store refund 0.01538461538 BTC per pomegranate, or the original 0.133 (which is now devalued)? Either the customer or store are taking a loss.
Why should the average consumer want to deal with any of this? They especially won't want to deal with fractional amounts like the ones above. At the current exchange rate, 1 or 2 BTC would be enough to cover an entire large grocery trip, so paying for individual items would mean extremely tiny amounts.
I just don't see it. We geeks will love it, but until these types of issues get sorted, I don't see the widespread POS network coming online.

No, we're well past the homebrew stage; the homebrew stage was 2-3 years ago.
This is being picked up by every major financial newspaper, public radio, evening news, etc., and the price has more than tripled in a month with people running in and throwing money at it; that's a bubble, and we're nearing the top of it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:32:16
Or wait until the day after and buy $10 worth of drugs...
Statements like yours are classic bubble statements. There is *no guarantee* that the price is going to continue to rise. $20 USD in a day is not sustainable.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:20:55
But isn't that exactly the same thing that BFL is doing right now?
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:34:38


While it's not technically stock, it's also not liquid. Stock is actually a good comparison to what it is right now.
The only reason that people are freaking out about Bitcoin right now is solely because of its fiat conversion amount, which makes it exactly like the stock bubble. Shares in a given company aren't worth anything, if you can't eventually convert them back to liquidity (fiat). Same with bitcoins; having 6500 bitcoins means *nothing* if you can't move them into a fiat currency or if the value *in fiat* is what it was in early 2011. 
The OP here is only a millionaire because he can sell his bitcoins for over $1M USD. Therefore, it's exactly like someone who had a block of stock in Apple or Google and was able to sell it off for USD.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:21:18
It's not going anywhere near 500 USD/coin right now. And yes, it will likely drop back to the mean, so look to where it was before the recent insane run-up started.
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:44:38
This is the right answer. If you're into BTC for the long-run, then the current price has no real concern for you. The people who care about the current run-up are the people speculating for cash; we've hit the point where the media is interested, outsiders are trying to get in fast so they can make a killing and convert out to fiat, etc.
When the price does go down, people who got in for the quick buck will vanish, and things will continue as they did back in January, when the price was a mere fraction of what it is now.
@_date: 2013-04-07 02:09:17
I'm honestly hoping the price does go down to shake out the short-termers.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:42:41
Depends on who you talk to. I would argue not. Look at the volatility. Watch the bitcoinity market charts. Today on bitfloor, the price went from $179 USD to $197 USD back to $179 USD in a matter of 3 hours.
To make any serious money off of that, you would have had to be in for a sizable amount of BTC at or before $179, and then sell quickly on your $18 gain, before you lose what you started with ($177 right now as I write this).
If you're trying to day trade, to make a few hundred on an $18 split would mean you'd need to buy at least 10 bitcoins and resell the difference, so a starting investment of $1790 USD, unless you're already in.
But that's just my take on it, others here will tell you something different entirely. I honestly didn't think we'd see it crack $150, so I was wrong there, but either way it can't sustain this current growth.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:22:12
Yes, *may* hold long-term promise, which currently BTC does not when the price triples in 6 days. I get it, everyone is thrilled to be able to cash out at such high values right now, but this does nothing good for the long term usage of BTC as a stable currency.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:53:22
Still a loss. Let's say Kodiack went in for his BFL anytime before this February (pre-order opened up last June).
According to him, $6k in coins, that's at least 33 coins (assuming current $180 USD per BTC). If you figure yesterday's rate of $160 USD, 37.5 coins.
BTC were ~$10-15 USD end of last year. $250 USD would have bought him 16 to 25 BTC.
He would have been better off paying in USD and keeping the coins he paid with instead.
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:41:54
The verification queue has nothing to do with the price of coins. The price could theoretically plummet while people are in line to get verified.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:54:47
And back then, everyone was talking about how you can't lose, how tech stocks are the greatest thing ever, they were all over the news, front page of newspapers, etc., and then it all collapsed. Repeat with the housing market. Repeat here, most likely.
Bitcoin is a crypto currency, sure, but mathematically modeled after real world currencies. A bubble can happen here just like anywhere else. Anyone saying otherwise is either trying to bump the price or is about to lose their shirt.
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:47:25
Honestly, just use another exchange. I transferred everything to BitFloor, was verified in a day.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:55:52
I'm actually inclined to agree, should bitcoin not be totally abandoned after this bubble selloff, I think we'll see a repeat of this.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:35:20
Excellent points.
@_date: 2013-04-07 02:49:14
One went for over $20k. The difference is that Avalon has actually sold hardware though, so you know their products aren't total vaporware. There have been fraudulent Avalon sales on eBay too, unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:22:14
Reminds me of 1999 all over again. People who were overnight stock millionaires, but never converted it into anything liquid. A lot of "wealth" vanished overnight.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:31:52
How is that even remotely relevant or comparable to this situation?
If I move from the US to Europe, and I exchange USD to Euro, that's a currency conversion. If the Euro more than *tripled* in value in a 30 day period because of speculators, then that's a bubble.
Why is this so hard for people to see? Tech stocks, housing, oil futures, anytime something jumps MASSIVELY up in price in a short time frame, there's always a portion on the other end where it flattens.
Look at the checklist here:
We have all the classic symptoms. Parabolic growth, a complete disconnect from reality, the press going madhouse, and other crypto-currencies like litecoins suddenly jumping from $0.05 cents to $4+ USD in 2 days, because they're closely related to bitcoins.
It may not happen today or tomorrow, but this is a bubble, and it will pop.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:31:20
You got it. Very few people are using it right now as actual currency. Most are hoarding it or now cashing out.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:28:27
If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck...
Many of us have made a nice chunk of change cashing out BTC to fiat currency, but none of us should doubt that this is indeed a speculative bubble. The price has gone from under $30 at the beginning of the year to over $900 today. In the last week alone it has more than tripled. These are not the underpinnings of a stable currency, unfortunately. Any time a price chart goes nearly vertical, it has to reverse at some point.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:19:51
Should have paid in USD instead. Then you'd only be out ~$250.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:16:33
Agreed 100%. I really don't see it going much higher than this in the immediate short term (these claims of it hitting $1000 BTC is just...no). People are going to sell off to move to fiat, and the price is going to crash heavily, way below $40.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:49:58
You might be right. Either way, we're both in agreement that this current pricing and growth is ridiculous, and 99% of the people looking at it are going, "Yep, classic bubble". Good for the people who got in early, but unsustainable.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:44:04
Right now, too much money is chasing too few assets (BTC). When that money sells off and people start leaving, the price will start to dip. Others will sell in a panic, and the remaining investors, desperate to not lose their money, will go into a hoarding mode and not buy any new BTC, which perpetuates the downward fall.

He's quoting "The Social Network".
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:46:28
So at current prices, you pay them .018181818 BTC for a sandwich. Ugh.
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:25:21
Agreed. They were terrific, very easy experience. Sad to see them go.
