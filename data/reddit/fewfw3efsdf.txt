how can you say that? we've barely even tested $6X, and the only time 50 has been tested was twice, immediately following the biggest BTC runup in history. support is really hard to find around here...

"$BTCUSD bumping up against resistance. breakout above 80 looks like run to 88 then 97  "
he's full of shit

no, it really isn't. the only possible reason someone with any amount of trading intelligence would put in an order like that would be to run up the price, or "buy a little to sell a lot". otherwise its just some moran paying more for coins instead of picking at the walls and letting other sellers line back up. 
you have to realize the game is a little different when you're trading 1000 coin lots.

daily and 3 daily charts look like bull traps. weekly chart still looks like shit. even the ticker charts just paint the picture of someone coming in and buying when there wasn't nearly enough liquidity to cover his order. I mean 6000 coins ordered in 3 minutes? Not smart buying. And don't forget, after 6 weeks where we saw 60 straight points of loss, we could just be seeing some antsy shorts covering and protecting their gains. honestly, I'd stay away for a few days and see how the market reacts to this.

most bitcoins have been purchased around &lt; 15 dollars

has it really though?

hey, you traded cash for bitcoins. welcome to the game. 
anyways, you can't seem to wrap your head around the fact that a single trader ran up the price of bitcoins for about 5 minutes because he was slapping the buy button. I don't know why you're getting all offended at me rightfully calling him a moron and warning people that now might not be the time to go long if you're expecting bitcoins to go up. get a fucking clue already, I don't care about your made up scenarios, this is what is happening right now.

Phrenico, I'm just going to straight up say you are a bad trader. If you don't understand why buying 6000 coins in a minute when there isn't enough liquidity to cover your order within a couple of points is a bad trade, then clearly trading isn't for you. 
I can explain it, but I can't understand it for you.
