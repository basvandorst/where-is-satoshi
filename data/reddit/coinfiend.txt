If you are trying to argue that bitcoin is not volatile based on a 1 day window when bitcoin has shown extreme volatility since conception you are wrong.

If anything it’s the other way around, we are the unstoppable tank baulking at the little regulators ��‍♂️

I agree that many of the “this is good for the bitcoin” rhetoric is laughable. However what is positive in this instance is that Facebook can be stopped by government but bitcoin can’t. 
No one expects the gov of the worlds reserve Currency to be pro bitcoin which is its greatest threat but acknowledgement of that threat is at least interesting.

There was also a large negative news release directly related to Tesla.. horrible comparison

So you waste water and power... great �� ��
@_date: 2019-07-13 06:54:31
On that I agree, volatility has taken us from .08 to 20k and now at 11.5k so It’s not a bad thing while we discover price. I don’t think Trumps stance surprised anyone the fact he tweeted about it probably did.

Why do we have to see every 2 bit operation that takes crypto... yes they have a crypto wallet great.. you can have a bittrex account and accept every shitcoin On the platform as payment it doesn’t mean anything.

Bitcoin is not dead, McAfee is an opportunistic charlatan however and his only interest in this space is taking  money, crypto or whatever else off people in pure self interest , I wish he was taken less seriously
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:51:07
Whatever you do be cautious, I had a friend try opening an old wallet and corrupted the shit out of it and lost them all. Get proper tech help but make sure you can trust them

Tokens are upgraded, that’s not the issue it’s been a fuck around but I think it’s a ledger hardware issue as I have to use an intermediate piece to connect as my laptop is USB C in any case not something I want to spend much time on while on vacay so I’ll tackle it when I’m settled thx for suggestion I understand this would be the most likely issue for bcap movement issues.

In today’s episode of when fomo goes bad �� I prefer seeing shorts wrecked though something more satisfying about pessimists getting more pessimistic.

Yes I think the quote when asked about btc was “it’s probably rat poison squared” and this was sometime ago I think anyone who has been in investments for years and is highly wary and doesnt understand the tech would have this approach and although a fantastic technology blockchain has been a vehicle for a multitude of  scams. For how much he’s asked about it he comments very little it’s just the crypto community is so sensitive to outside criticism.

Haha a bunch of basement dwellers calling the most successful investor of all time a fraud and a moron... He’s fkn 90 he has no particular interest just let him be if you’re right about crypto you don’t need his endorsement if you’re wrong you don’t deserve it.
@_date: 2019-06-15 04:13:58
I don’t even think he hates it, He has successfully operated for many years in the legacy investment  system he would have contacts, friends associates in these industries and companies and be confident investing within these parameters. Bitcoin and crypto are still also very small and relatively nascent I agree anyone of considerable net worth should have a little btc and crypto even as a hedge but I think the anger of the community is disproportional in his case

Do they though? Bitcoin has failed spectacularly as a currency so far that’s why we are doing the store of value thing now..
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:10:27
Wait until a definitive trend reversal forms, it’s bearish and will continue to drop you will just catch knives all the way down. Don’t buy on small upticks because the trend will resume down, wait for a clear reversal if it never reverses you save investing in a dud anyway.

You should get the funds back immediately.. people taking binance side are you serious? They locked a shit ton of money and gave flippant and contrasting reasons.. now there trying to call you out on social media has a bad actor?? No you provide a service and get paid very well for it binance your involvement stops there. Stop trying to play god with peoples money this is why we need decentralised exchanges operating effectively ASAP.

Yeah its good operates as an interface without seeing or knowing private keys have had no issues. Hardware wallet is better but if you need to trade its one of the best imo
