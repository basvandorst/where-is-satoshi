I don't have a webshop where i sell my music. Until now i've been using iTunes &amp; Spotify. Seems like libertymusicstore.net is what i needed..

1 beer  NiemiV
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:20:12
Just voted. If i had one wish it would be for Alibaba &amp; Aliexpress to accept bitcoins.. That would give merchants a place to stock up their products using only Crypto. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 10:11:39
Then let's continue the revolution 50 bits

I see. Buut not really what i ment. The reason we havent "mapped" every genome or DNS string. The reason why we havent calculated many aspects of space travel. The reason for theese, and a lot of other things is that we simply dont have the computing power to do so.. im thinking to make a coin that is simply designed to gather computing power and use it for important stuff. The people with the coins would decide what calculations the network should do

@_date: 2014-11-18 11:09:55
Ouch! 100 bits
@_date: 2014-11-18 13:06:19
@_date: 2014-11-18 12:14:56
thank you so much you lovely person.

true, true!! 50 bits
@_date: 2014-09-29 07:42:08
I see. But don't seem very harmless when they do so i cannot access my coins. Scared the s*** out if me. Coins are moved to cold storrage now!
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:32:17
p.s. small note to all you US sellers.. You should not forget the rest of us... SO many didnt ship to Denmark, and with a global economy, we need fast and global shipping.
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:23:34


every item that aliexpress send it free shipping and with tracking. I even have to sign when i get stuff from aliexpres. So when the order is marked as "recieved" i will know
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:17:18
and yet not a single chineese B2C wholesaler offers bitcoin as payment.. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:50:31
This is awesome!
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:26:30
Sometimes i hate myself for not buying more.. But hey, i was broke,
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:07:15
i bought a bunch of stuff using bitcoin today.. You should try it
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:41:05


Thats also what i did. WooCommerce and set up with wholesalers :) Can i see your site?
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:43:57
That is true.. It will be a new age when they do accept it tough. Then you can buy EVERYTHING with btc. From clothing to cups
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:42:51
thanks a lot :) appreciate it 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:56:48
Who is talking now? He's pretty awesome
@_date: 2013-12-13 11:15:30
Thanks. I also think it has something to it.. If there were more people interested i would gladly post the report that i wrote about it..
