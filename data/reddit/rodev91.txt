Spoofing.

That simply is not true. The comparison is made all the time and that is exactly the reason it is talked about in relation to Bitcoin so much. People are *potentially* falling victim to the things Bitcoin was supposed to protect us from.

It is really energy intensive, something I've always thought to be a huge negative.

They way he talks.... I don't know if I could ever stand having a real conversation with someone like this.
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:51:38
Is it?

I added .25 to the arsenal today!

It seems to me just as dangerous to deny a viable short term solution simply because "that's what the bad guys want."
Where do the core developers say 2mb blocks lead to centralization?
Thanks in advance.

You can all do your part by searching "Bitcoin" and navigating to the bitcoin.org page and leaving it open for a few minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:34:13
I like this idea.

Shuality quitpost!

Is there anything inherently wrong with 2MB blocks? (hodler) 
Edit: The hostility I'm seeing in the responses are is disappointing. The community really has changed. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:11:36
I would be willing to work on this full time if I could get some support from the community. ;)  
Looked for someone to reach out to at Bitcoin.org , do they have a primary contact email?

Bitcoin has been around for nearly a decade. You haven't learned anything? He's not allowed to perform a historical analysis of market trends and make estimates based on this? Keep in mind his post contained mostly real stats. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:50:41
Sounds like you've got it all figured out...
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:10:50
It didn't hit 6 figures.

He mentions that the mining pays for the electricity consumption and thats about it. The profit comes from reselling the equipment and a higher price. So you do understand that he is claiming to make literally nothing off of the process of mining. You do understand that...right?
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:00:31
So wouldn't it make sense to not mine and just buy and resell these machines for more money?
