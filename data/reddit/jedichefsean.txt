yeah, i don't have a ton of BTC, and i probably never will. i just opened a breadwallet and i really like what i see. i may just keep both, maybe 60-40 breadwallet and blockchain...

Qoinpro is something I'm trying out...
This is a referral link, and yes, I will supposedly get credit for anyone who signs up using that link. They gave me a one time deposit of 0.00000250btc and will give anyone this deposit who signs up. You also get a daily btc deposit of some micro amount. (Lots of zeroes and a 1) but I'm trying it out, it's free and doesn't require me to click this or captcha that...I signed up and will probably forget my login info. But hey, if it gradually builds btc, then why not?

That's awesome. Side question: how do businesses reconcile BTC transactions? Is the value immediately converted to usd or are BTC amounts compiled separately and then either held that way for an indefinite amount of time or converted in larger groups?

Very cool, thank! I'll have to check it out

i just mean ever since the blockchain thing, and i was a fan, is there really a wallet service that i can 100% rely on? i suppose nothing is fool proof, but i just never thought i'd have a reason to doubt blockchain. maybe i'm just a dreamer.

Thank you. The best response I could have hoped for. I always worried businesses were putting themselves at risk for accepting BTC.
