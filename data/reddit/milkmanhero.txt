It's a lul, and it's nice to see things fail, it's nice that things CAN fail, unlike too big to fail banks.
There has to be order, if someone makes a mistake they need to be culpable, if its a mistake that takes down their company then so be it, why should everyone else have to chip in at gunpoint to fix someone else's fraudulent behaviour?
This is one of the reasons why BTC will indeed prevail IMO.

You *might* do OK off those domains but I wouldn't hold my breath, you're correct that a lot of Bit related domains have been taken up but how many have content and how many are purely speculative and will just not get renewed? I'd wager many fall into the latter.
The issue is compounded with all the new stupid toplevels like .store .app .blog .mail etc, unless it's really 'brandable' there's nothing stopping someone grabbing something punchy on one of these new TLDs and making a go of it.
Anyway, all the best with it, I'd just forget about them and see what the market says in 2016 :)

I've outlined plans for the above using the BTC address as a unique identifier to allow content to instantly stream upon receiving payment to said address.
It has, has, has to be open source though, and that's what I've been working on in this project 'backbit' otherwise it's a horribly backwards implementation of legacy thinking on what is supposedly next gen finance!

Sigh, I gave him a dollar :(

I can think of 7 reasons why you're right.
1.) You're right.
7.) He's wrong.
@_date: 2014-12-09 14:32:52
1.) It didn't
1.) Fraud (IMO)
2.) Fraud (IMO)
3.) It's considered much more than just a currency, but if someone is willing to accept it for goods and services then yes.
4.) Yes, lessons have been learned, it at least shows that too big to fail doesn't exist in this space at least for now.

This is such an important subject yet never seems to gain much traction or interest.
The most responsive thing I've seen to get others to give a rats ass is the bail in infographic above.

Sure, that's the role of an intermediary, and plenty have worked out bitstamp, bitfinex etc
You've also got arbitrage that the company can actively get involved in.

Transparency and trust, many legacy systems don't sign up to these ideas as a way of business, many of the zombie banks would cease to exists (rightly so) without unscrupulous deeds.
It's important we don't just repeat the mistakes legacy systems have made, hence open source is surely the way forward.
Alas it seems plenty don't think like this and just want to be the next useless intermediary like VASA or MOOSTERCARD, that's where the wrestle comes in.

"Please avoid saying 'magic' as it may come across as patronising."
I'd try to steer clear of using an analogy if you can, again depends on audience I suppose but it seems most people nowadays will BS there way through everything pretending that they know what you're talking about rather than asking a question.
I'd get a few solid topics in,
 I'd go through the basics of fungibility.
I'd also go through the basics of what goods and services people are willing to accept Bitcoin for.

Anyone? :D

If you don't want a huge monopoly then help me build an open source payment handler, I've already documented how it would work, I keep saying it on reddit, not one person listens!

“The demand is starting to dry up,” said David L. Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “I think a lot of the excitement may have bled out of investors.”
Pictures speak a thousand words.

Very interesting idea Vespco, there's definitely an upswing in 'board game' type games recently IMO, the idea sounds complicated but if you crack that I think you're onto something there.
