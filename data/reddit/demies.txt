Friend of mine has a vegetable garden after school activity, where kids learn about nature, good healthy food and how good grow them, that always needs help. It's tiny though.

Yeah, received a transfer of BTC this morning at 12, still not even 1 confirmation, with a queue of around 280k to go. This might take a while.

That is beautiful. I so wish we would ever hear again from Satoshi.

In Spain there is an agency that lets you buy houses with BTC, so it's not a mortgage, but its better since no banks are involved.

Aaah loved my old E71. It had maps, chat, ELECTRONIC MAIL! It was magic and the keyboard was great until apple dashed its clunky Os and its aspirations in the ground, one laggy app at a time.

Everything before the event didn't happen, never happened and will be wiped from all records.

So buy btc, move to binance, sell for usdt, or anything else and setup shop somewhere else? It's their right to close your account, as long as they give you back the money or its value in BTC, or am I wrong?
