You can't scale Bitcoin to 7B users purely on chain any time this century. It's impossible for the network to manage 10GB blocks. The very best you can hope for at this stage is 32MB blocks, bringing us to a *whopping* 100 tps.
If the thought of depositing $1000 into multisig for your daily payments via Lightning, Open Transactions, or sidechains scares you, you need to sell all your BTC now because by definition you aren't here for the long run. That, or you're sticking your head in the sand.
And it's just mind boggling why some people insist on calling out core developers Wlad, Pieter and Greg who all believe Bitcoin needs to scale, each of whom likely owns more BTC than you and I combined ever will for not wanting the system to dominate.

I've seen countless 20MB proponents conveniently presupposing *all* Bitcoin startups will have "enough of a reason" to run their own full node. 20MB proponents claim that because these theoretical businesses will have theoretical reasons to run a node, and because there's no incentive otherwise, the only way to increase the full node diversity is to increase general adoption of the blockchain. They suggest doing this by increasing its size.
However, this is demonstrably a false narrative going by the actions of ShapeShift.io. If ShapeShift.io, *a literal Bitcoin exchange*, doesn't see enough of a reason to run their own node internally, how can you *possibly* suggest a majority of late adopting Bitcoin businesses will run full nodes? It's just a patently bad assumption, *already*. And we're not even at 1MB blocks yet. It's already a problem amongst early adopter Bitcoin companies to run full nodes.


OK - does a Bitcoin exchange like ShapeShift somehow *not* need the security benefits of running a node? If a literal Bitcoin exchange is outsourcing their node, what business *would* need the security of a full node? Guess those incentives really *are* lacking. Or maybe it's just that the only way to increase node diversity is to make it cost effective enough, and simple enough, to do on the average person's home computer.  Color me shocked that the original model under which Bitcoin QT was launched, a desktop Bitcoin client, remains the only viable model to see to its general widespread adoption. Since that's a problem due to the block size, the block size limit must be held back for the benefit of the general public.


My post is about full node diversity, nowhere did I even suggest businesses wouldn't accept BTC, just that they won't run a full node.


The exact same arguments for increasing the block size from 1MB to 20MB apply to increasing the block size from 20MB to 400MB. You cannot possibly give any assurance that you will not rile the public up to pull off the same contentious hard fork in the future if you're able to do it now, to the dismay of the majority of core developers, and before block size is even a problem! Come back to me when people are making videos in tears, literally *sobbing on the streets* because they can't make a Bitcoin payment - then I'll be sure to support a block size increase! It's not worth sacrificing the future of full nodes before that tipping point is reached. People can deal with higher fees, really they can.

You stated:


As if core developers like Greg have commit access to a multi billion dollar project *for no reason at all*. Even *arbitrary* reasons. I'm sorry if I came off emotional to you, but what you're saying even if it was done tongue in cheek, is abrasive and disrespectful.

So what you're saying is, contrary to the present reality, masses of average people will suddenly *care* about which currency they're using on a daily basis? This in absence of a total financial meltdown, *why*?  What reason does the average person have to invest all of their money into Bitcoin unless they live in Argentina, Venezuela, Greece, etc?
Do you not understand Bitcoin doesn't have to do anything at all to outlive fiat currencies? Worst case scenario, post-collapse people will just have to use Coinbase or Circle. They'll still be buying into a fixed supply global currency that can't be debased by bankers or inflated by political whim. From Coinbase, they could deposit into multisig for Lightning, OT, and sidechains. Mix coins, anonymize the bulk of their savings and put in cold storage on the main chain, keeping spending money in multisig for OT, LN.

It's impossible to spend the same inputs twice in Bitcoin barring a 51% attack, only one transaction spending the same inputs can be valid. I'm not surprised this isn't yet common knowledge. Just because you're not used to doing something doesn't mean you'll be ready to abandon Bitcoin's network effect, wallet infrastructure security and most importantly *liquidity* for inferior cryptos or fiat currencies. And if you do want to abandon Bitcoin over something so trivial, chances are very high you're not here to endure. Just get it over with and sell out now.
By definition your other myriad "concerns" will depend on market conditions.
Bottom line: if you want mindless instant, free, stable coffee payments, you have three options:
1. go back to PayPal, bye!
2. deposit $1000 into multisig for Lightning, Open Transactions, or a sidechain
3. use Coinbase, Circle etc
For everything else, just pay a higher fee!

Because everyone who holds BTC will immediately sell it in anger for a featureless clonecoin if Bitcoin's blocks are full and fees, God forbid, *rise*.

Mixing: The very best the main chain has are shady DNM sites that charge insane fees, and joinmarket.io which has brutally low liquidity, so I just don't know what you're talking about here. It's going to be much more viable to mix coins with CT sidechains or ring signature sidechains. Open Transactions comes standard with receipt destruction, allowing you to make untraceable swaps.
HD wallets: you're not liquidating 100% of your BTC holdings day in day out are you? The bulk of your BTC remains unmoving in cold storage HD wallets, doesn't it? What's the last thing you even paid for with BTC, and how much did you even spend? Whether or not the blocks are full, the bulk of your money is staying in cold storage, period. If block size prevented people from withdrawing money from Lightning, Open Transactions, sidechains, or Coinbase, *then* we could look at increasing the block size. We're talking fees becoming $5 to $10 per BTC transaction, then you could reasonably argue this is an impediment to depositing or withdrawing money into your cold storage HD wallet.


Because a fixed supply global currency is useless to you unless you can liquidate 100% of your BTC on chain day in day out? SMH.
No matter what happens, you'll be able to keep the bulk of your life savings in cold storage.
You should be keeping trivial daily spending money in multisig for Lightning, OT, sidechains. God forbid you keep $50 on Coinbase.

SPV payment channels are a good idea, but only a partial solution. If the block size becomes so large that the up front investment in deploying a full node as a business is $100,000+, it's no better than the state of ASIC mining and the result is still an ISP model.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:40:31
The Pareto Principle would suggest the market for full nodes will still converge around a handful of the biggest companies, such as BlockCypher and Coinbase; 20% of competitors will corner 80% of the market. What are the implications on privacy? What are the implications of paying BlockCypher just to make a Bitcoin startup or a basic Bitcoin application? What are the implications of shifting the majority of `bitcoind` users to regulated and identifiable corporations?
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:33:48
1. People who "follow mkts" are not average people.
2. Who but  do you think codes and maintains Bitcoin's consensus layer? If you think they're going to capitulate, shouldn't you be advocating for the widest possible distribution of full nodes and decentralized exchange? Decentralization makes capitulation of  core developers irrelevant. That's the entire idea of keeping the block size manageable for the average person, or at worst, the average motivated person.
Move to an ISP model and see how resilient Bitcoin becomes to government pressure.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:57:06
Your plan is SPV payment channels? So who will provide these channels?
Today, anyone. But if block size becomes so large that the up front cost of launching a full node is $100,000, the situation is very different. Hence, SPV payment channels for nodes are **an incomplete solution** without an artificial cap on the block size.
For simplicity's sake, I suggested BlockCypher *or similar companies* will run the $100,000 nodes.
You then suggested $100k is no big deal for a company, to which I responded, fine - but then the Pareto Principle would suggest 80% of the market gets served by 20% of the corporations serving that market.
You claim this isn't a problem, because:


Do you really believe the NSA/GCHQ etc *care* about legal jurisdictions when it comes to usurping data wholesale?
I ask you again: what are the privacy implications of routing 80% of Bitcoin network traffic to a handful of large, regulated companies?
If 20% of full node providers, e.g. BlockCypher, dispatched 80% of all Bitcoin transactions, you'd be sending 80% of network traffic to large, identifiable, regulated corporations. I'm pretty sure the NSA/GCHQ has a playbook for that one.
And what are the implications of making the majority of `bitcoind` users regulated companies? Wouldn't that create a different set of pressures on Bitcoin Core developers? Wouldn't regulators be able to exert pressure on BlockCypher et al in ways they couldn't do to individual node operators running them on a RPi?

Resend your transaction with a higher fee then. I know I know, First World Problems.
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:06:14
Sorry, but it's pretty clear that you are either a troll or are woefully inexperienced and own few if any BTC.
This would be different if people were constantly sending others BTC for free on the streets as a means to spearhead adoption. But that never happens in reality. The closest we come is media blitzes where someone holds up a QR code on national TV. Would a $1 transaction fee stop some of those PR payments from going on? Maybe some, but certainly not all.
Anyone with over $10k in BTC at this point will NOT be spending 100% of it on a daily basis, period. That's just not how savings accounts *work*, and you would understand this to be true if you had saved a large amount of money in BTC for any significant period of time.
You don't need to have "write access" almost ever aside from your most valuable transactions. Trivial low value payments can happen on Lightning, on Open Transactions, or on sidechains for cheaper, at faster rates and likely with better privacy. And God forbid you leave $50 on Coinbase after you buy from them.

Then increase your miner's fee until which time Lightning, sidechains, and OT are ready, and your transactions will confirm with priority. The only significant future of full nodes is on the desktop, and it isn't worth further wrecking the full node diversity just so that more people can spend less on transaction fees. Most people can afford to put $1000 in multisig for their *spending money*. It's like funding PayPal from your bank account, except it's trustless and you can do it anonymously.

Could it be because Hearn's XT fork was vehemently rejected by:
- 80% of developers with commit access to [Bitcoin Core](
- Adam Back
- 100% of the maintainers of Bitcoin.org
Could it have something to do with the fact that the creator of XT, Mike Hearn, has lobbied for [Bitcoin redlists](




Or that it was also Hearn who lobbied for Tor [hidden service censorship](






































Could it be because Bitcoin Improvement Proposals like BIP100 exist, are better than XT's proposal, and are also the only officially sanctioned mechanism by which to interject sweeping, foundational changes to Bitcoin Core.
Could it be because a significant majority of technically adept Bitcoin developers have cast serious doubt on the legitimacy of the XT fork?
This XT fork is starting to sound rather controversial to me. Fancy that.

Bitcoin's earliest adopters were tech savvy and dedicated to the cause. We've saturated that demographic already. The people who are running Bitcoin startups where full nodes are necessary, are largely already aware of Bitcoin, and they're already *outsourcing* their nodes to BlockCypher. ShapeShift.io is doing exactly this, and it's headed by Erik Voorhees, who of all people you would expect to be able and willing to run a full node.
As more and more people adopt Bitcoin, an increasingly bigger majority of them will see no reason at all to run full nodes or run a Bitcoin specialty startup. Unless doing so has clear privacy benefits to them or it doesn't come with much additional cost or complexity, they will never run nodes.
Hence, Coinbase, BitPay and the established industry giants will run full nodes, and will lobby for increased block sizes with more and more efficacy because if they're allowed to have their way just *once*, this makes it more difficult for individuals to run nodes, and it's a negative reinforcement loop, making the entire space revolve around them and giving them and by extension regulators an increasing amount of power and control.
Late adopters will tend to give exponentially less of a f*** about running nodes or starting businesses etc, just by nature of the technology adoption curve. With an unrestricted block size, there's no reason to think we can avoid an ISP model dominated by industry giants where only a tiny minority of large regulated middlemen can run nodes.

No. Let's pretend "we the people" (WTP) are poor, which isn't exactly a stretch from reality. The WTP Party is going to vote on city taxes. Since I'm poor, and you're poor, and in fact 90% of us are poor, WTP Party proposes to tax the richest 10% in the city *75%* of their wealth. A wealth tax designed to effectively nationalize and redistribute to the poor their private property. Sounds good to me, what about you, Bob? Are you in? Yeah Alice, I'm in too, looks like we have 90% of the vote!

Bitcoin is the only form of money with fixed supply not able to be debased by political whim that exists outside the traditional financial sector. That's why I'm using it, at least. If it "runs out of capacity", I'm not changing that view. What else would I do, switch to *goldmoney*?


MultiBit is taking a 1000 Satoshi fee per on-chain payment. They clearly have a direct financial incentive to support more on-chain payment activity: they get paid more!
Electrum is teaming up with CryptoCorp to take a fee on unlocking multisig protected coins for on-chain payment activity. They clearly have a direct financial incentive to support more on-chain payment activity: they too, get paid more!
Both of these profit models directly incentivize their developers to increase the block size for their own selfish profit.
SPV wallet developers that bear none of the direct costs of the block size increase, since none of them run full nodes, and who have a direct financial incentive for their users to make on-chain payments, are obviously going to favor increasing the block size because it's profitable for them to do so.
Meanwhile, all the Bitcoin QT developers except for Gavin are vehemently *against* a block size increase.


Oh? BitcoinJ doesn't support Lightning or Open Transactions or sidechains? Boo hoo! It's not like your first world problems are the end of technological innovation. If you're not willing to write the code, I guarantee you someone else will be more than willing to pick up for your slack and take all your users.

Now, according to 20MB proponents, an exchange like this is the epitome of a Bitcoin business that warrants trustless blockchain polling, "virtually guaranteeing" they run full nodes. In reality, ShapeShift is outsourcing their full node to BlockCypher.

How could a private blockchain *ever* be a store of value, let alone a *global* currency?
Cash USD has value to people, even people outside of America.
It's because the USD cash is good at the point of sale, it's perfectly fungible right then and there.
You can put USD cash in a suitcase and walk away no matter who you are. That's what cash has to be.
Let's just forget you made this comparison with private blockchains because the entire concept of a "private blockchain" is a complete joke when it comes to global currency. It's patently unworkable, and I'm perplexed as to why anyone who understands Bitcoin would make this comparison. edit: is a buttcoiner troll, makes sense.


The only time transaction confirmation time has mattered in my experience, is when I'm in a hurry to make a trade on a centralized exchange.
Is your experience different? Give examples. I've been at this since 2012. Aside from those cases, it's never been a problem. I've paid international contractors 100s-1000s of USD in BTC, never once did confirmation time matter.
As for this hype about how the entire Bitcoin system will crash and be forever destroyed - it would be almost buttcoin levels of FUD if it weren't first spewed by Mike Hearn. To think Bitcoin will forever, permanently be destroyed just from hitting full blocks is complete FUD, and Gavin admitted to such on a recent interview. If you can't somehow pay for your coffee instantly on the blockchain, it's not the end of the world.
As for other other FUD:
1. "Full nodes will randomly crash". False. It's only true if `bitcoind` strictly *needed* the mempool to store unconfirmed transactions, which it doesn't. Full nodes can easily cache unconfirmed transactions on the hard disk instead of RAM. It's just a simple upgrade of the full node software.
2. "People will have to resend payments with a higher fee". True, but then maybe you should've deposited $1000 onto an Open Transactions voting pool, or onto the Lightning Network to avoid that predictable outcome. OT and LN are trustless, unregulated, and anonymous. For small time payments, it's all you'd need and is in fact cheaper, faster and more private than using the blockchain. What counts is denominating transactions in a fixed supply cryptocurrency that can't be debased by bankers. LN and OT still accomplish that, and they do it far faster and cheaper than the blockchain, which at its core is only meant for high value usage.
3. "But coffee transactions should be instant and free, and altcoins will eat bitcoin etc". Again, see OT and LN. You're saying you "cannot" accept a compromise of depositing $1000 into multisig or LN or OT? What is so hard about that? I guarantee you it will be no harder or slower than opening a bank account and funding your debit card with fiat.

The very best you can hope for is 32MB blocks, bringing us to a *whopping* 100 tps. That isn't enough for global adoption.
Sidechains, Open Transactions, the Lightning Network are unavoidable in any significant adoption scenario. And my God, what is so bad about depositing $1000 in multisig for your daily spends? If you're like most people, the bulk of your BTC savings *never move from cold storage*.
The Deniers are just harming Bitcoin by sticking their heads in the sand, thinking 10GB blocks are achievable without only ISPs being able to run full nodes.

Define "serious financial risks". Whatever happened to "never invest anything into Bitcoin that you cannot afford to lose".
Define "crash". Whatever happens, how is this theoretical "crash" any less bad than a hard fork where two diverging Bitcoin networks exist. Do you believe **definitively** proving to the public that the supposed "rule-by-math" of cryptocurrency is illusory, will be *less bad* than people having to re-submit payments with a higher fee?
I'm here for Bitcoin in the long term. If it takes ten years for hardware capacity and network availability to service what many of you believe is Bitcoin's inevitable just-around-the-corner massive adoption spree, then so be it.

It's like the chief engineer of your billion dollar investment who is also a majority shareholder is pointing out systemic issues and refusing to budge.
