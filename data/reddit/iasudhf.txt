doesn't matter.  we already know the total BTC that can ever exist is capped at under 21 million.
Bitcoin's (the payment system) utility X bitcoin's (the currency) relative scarcity = the moon one day

Indeed.  Those who understand Bitcoin's globally disruptive potential are looking much further ahead than a few months.

Let me translate your post: I'm shorting BTC, listen to my FUD so BTC are worth less
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:36:34
I'm not trying to stop people selling.  Sell your BTC, I'll have them! And so will anyone else who understands Bitcoin's potential. That's what I'm saying.

FWIW, I sat the invigilated MENSA test one time and scored 154 on the Cattell scale (within top 2%)*, which qualified me to join.  Never did join, as I only did it to find out my score.  And I think Bitcoin is a brilliant idea and stands a very good chance of seriously changing the world of finance (just for starters).
*No, I didn't get an infinite number of monkeys to complete the test for me, though they would (eventually) qualify to join as well.

I really don't care what the price is today, tomorrow, next week, next month, or in 6 months.
I started backing Bitcoin when I realised its utility and potential.  I'm in for where Bitcoin will be in 5 years+.
Strap yourself into the rollercoaster, keep buying bitcoin, and don't bail out for 5 years+.  
You'll thank me for that advice in 2019+.

Let's see who's views are retarded in 5 years shall we.
I didn't post my original message because I do care what the price is today.  I posted to explain why I really DON'T care what the price is today.  
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:23:55
That doesn't make sense.  In effect, you're saying that every time someone says they don't care, that means they really do.  It ought to be obvious to you from your own experience that there are things you genuinely don't care about, and, most probably, you will have expressed that view about not caring on occasions.  
So you know from your own experience that it's flawed reasoning to conclude someone does care because they say they don't.
By contrast, your comment about me being 'desperate and afraid' is classic projection.  You don't know the first thing about me, so you cannot possibly know my affective state.

Hey thanks!  I've never been tipped before though - I've seen ppl tip and claim tips, but don't know how tips are collected or claimed.  The only link in your post is to the changetip page at reddit. I followed that link, but didn't see any instructions on how to claim.  What do I do to collect?  Cheers!

You only get that result by arbitrarily analysing the BTC exchange rate over 9 months.
The volatility swings with BTC are admittedly wild due to relative lack of liquidity, which is only to be expected in a new, young currency at this stage.
But look at the BTC/fiat exchange rate over the life of BTC, 5 years or so.  It has been nothing but upwards.  Exponentially so.
Feb 2010 - less than $0.01
Feb 2011 - $1
Dec 2012 - $13
April 2013 - $266
At time of writing - $305
The ones who sat tight during previous wild swings have always seen their value come back and seen gains too.
The ones who don't have the stomach for the volatility swings and bail out do of course take a loss.
Price stability will come over time as adoption and use of Bitcoin increases.

It is not a defect that Bitcoin is not backed or supported by a large organisation and/or government.  It's an essential feature and benefit.  With Bitcoin you don't need to trust anyone because the cryptography takes care of that for you.
You reckon USD is a 'secure fiat'???  Go check out QE and inflation, and see how much your dollars are progressively losing value, and have been losing value for a very long time.

There are far more thefts, hacks and dishonesties going on in the world of fiat currencies and banking.
Looking over the last 5 years since Bitcoin was launched, it has been a huge success - Bitcoin was no more that one person's abstract idea with no-one else at all backing it when Satoshi started it.

The people who understood what they were buying into, and why, who understood how Bitcoin has a serious chance of changing the world, are still holding (and buying/spending too).
I've been buying bitcoins for a while, have bought at both below and above the price you quote of $700.
If you bought in early this year expecting to go to the moon in 6 months and are now quitting cos it didn't happen I think you need to re-evaluate Bitcoin.
Bitcoin still has the potential to go to the moon price wise  - and change the world for the better in various ways too - but don't expect this to happen ultra short-term.  You need to think further ahead than that.
