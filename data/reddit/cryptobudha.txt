That's what I got as well.
What I don't get it is why anyone would want to buy them on a crowdsale as they are planning to do to fund themselves. 
Usually participants in those expect future raise of the value of the token if the app gets traction. But here seems more foggy if it will increase in value EVEN if the app gets traction. Right?
@_date: 2016-04-22 11:46:37
Next bubble will make the last one look boring.
@_date: 2016-04-26 13:26:46
The absolute volume in BTC will still be high. It's just the chinese exchanges generate so much fake volume it makes the real one look small as %.
@_date: 2016-04-25 11:35:04
Looks suitable. Are they any good though? 
@_date: 2016-04-22 11:51:00
Yeah I believe it was the same principle. What happened with them? Anyone?
@_date: 2016-04-28 14:17:32
anyone tried them? 
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:24:46
First time I even hear they are doing crowdsale?!
@_date: 2016-04-22 11:47:30
It doesn't make sense to follow laws which you yourself are responsible to observe for not breaking. Right?
@_date: 2016-04-22 15:14:53
do they have virtual cards? not physical?
@_date: 2016-04-28 14:11:35
ah ok :)
Waiting for the news coverage then. Hope they clarify by then.
@_date: 2015-12-16 15:48:57


Sure about that?
@_date: 2015-12-14 12:53:26
Isn't that the official Forbes twitter account that linked to this random blogger opinion though?
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:03:47
Exactly my thoughts!
@_date: 2015-12-22 14:21:00
Ah that is great! 
I'll take a look at the new wallet as well.
@_date: 2015-12-14 12:46:40
This is actually a great idea and has the potential to be a killer app. Business can get more sales and be paid with less fees. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 19:19:55
1. What is the currency conversion fee when charged in non-EUR?
2. Isn't 3 days to fund the card excessive, when most people in EU can load any EUR card they have with SEPA wire from any EU exchange in 24 hours?
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:43:53


They tried to put him behind bars, but he thought they are snickers bars and ate them. 
Now seriously, I vaguely remember some official note from the Japanese government how this is not something they will deal with. Google a bit if you are interested.
And I'm not sure US government has global reach of it's gag orders. 
Well, they can gag order him with a drone I guess, but he is not that important yet :)
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:28:54
Sounds pretty fucking cool

and then I give them the finger on my way to my mansion. :)
@_date: 2015-12-21 13:02:57
How is that? Isn't the sepa wire costing you only 90 cents?
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:42:31
Ok I read all comment and still not entirely clear what exactly is that and what are the benefits? Someone smart about those things please?
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:40:36
end to end encryption with open source local clients is the only serious way
@_date: 2015-12-09 14:55:56
Finally someone to notice!
He just registered close enough email at a service Satoshi was using.
That's all.
@_date: 2015-12-14 12:51:25
Just 2 years ago bitcoin was a tullip now Forbes actually recommends to invest in it.  
Smile on my face. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 13:02:06
um, yeah? What's yours?
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:49:40
My thought as well when I read this.
40%+ awareness among the young ones within 6 years (3 active ones) is pretty damn good in my book

cause the one posted is analog? :)
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:49:29
My bet is he is just a slightly crazy person obsessed with Satoshi and desiring to have achieved  what he did so bad that he is ready to make it all up.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:41:42

The gag order theory is just a wild speculation.
He is french based in Japan. Japan wasn't interested in investigating.
How the fuck US would gag order him?
I think he is just being fat sociopath.
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:16:10
We all know you are sociopath so let me be the one that puts it to you straight. Nobody cares about unimportant mispresentations about on which floor is your office and how many hours you spend on the stupid care. 
The only thing people care about is what happened with the 800k bitcoins. You for sure have a lot to say even with the investigation but choosing not to do so and  that way prolonging the agony of a lot of decent people. Do you understand that?!

ear protection is for pussies. Everyone knows that.
@_date: 2015-06-02 14:27:13
solid reason :)
@_date: 2015-12-15 11:15:56
Yeah because their own currency is much safer :)
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:04:46
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:59:31
Yeah I'm like that since 2012
We are the crazy ones now. That might change.
@_date: 2015-06-05 11:56:14
I see your point now.
I agree a lot of people will prefer that peace of mind.
Actually most people maybe. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 11:52:06
ah, u funny :)
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:09:22
Actually he should win like all of them.
@_date: 2015-06-05 13:11:36
It uses only bitstamp for this? I didn't even know this. 
Well at least they don't use just 1 outside provider of randomness, oh wait.....
anyway, now seriously, what they do use for calculating all the local currencies in their mobile wallet?
@_date: 2015-06-02 14:33:31
Those legacy people with their legacy ideas. Bitcoin doesn't need bank because the idea of bitcoin is to be your own fucking bank.
Still, it's  not bad to have that option for the legacy thinking people.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:46:06
I think it should be a dynamic limit based on the meows in the last x amount of purrs.
@_date: 2015-06-02 14:24:15
So they added PGP for the notifications but not as an option for person to person messages? Huh, classic.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:08:36
but of course.....
@_date: 2015-06-05 13:12:31
so there is a moon on the horizont? 
@_date: 2014-09-11 11:34:44
I hear ya, and I also have stopped talking to people about bitcoin, unless they ask. Then I become quite passionate....
It's sad to see how ignorant most people are. And how you are alone in what you clearly see to be the best thing in the last 2 decades.
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:02:22
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:42:17
Amsterdam 2014 which was the most major even for the year was cheaper and it was a 2 days one with absolutely legendary people speaking.
Also I'm a business and find it expensive. 
Which means that even less people will go which makes it even more expensive for the social element provided.
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:18:48
but do you buy the bitcoins though?
because if you do you are taking a risk
if you aren't the customer will be pretty pissed if the price increases in the meantime
@_date: 2014-10-12 11:00:59
solid point indeed
@_date: 2014-08-04 13:10:04
how otherwise you expect to have a bank card? :)
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:22:53
Actually that's great point. There is so many merchants in europe dodging tax that this initiative alone might be enough for some of them to start taking bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:13:20
Great project, I would like to see it done.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:29:27
Is that service stupid or I just don't understand it?
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:45:58
looks pretty good! Do we know anything about them?
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:53:02
How much money they've got? How much are they putting in? When?
Is it Christmas already?
@_date: 2014-10-16 12:35:18
Well they answer that in the faq
"If you wait to debit my funds, what happens if I move value out of my Coinbase, Ripple, or Dwolla account while the transaction shows as PENDING? What if I disconnect my account(s)?
We are working hard to shorten the time between authorization and settlement, but for this beta program, it’s very possible for you to put Shift on the hook to cover your transactions. Our hope is that we don’t have any bad eggs in the batch! If we encounter any suspicious activity, we will have to deactivate your card. "
Hoping to not have bad eggs in the basket doesn't sound like a serious business plan to me.
@_date: 2014-09-12 09:06:43
lol, that was actually really funny :)
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:41:04
Is that a SWIFT wire? If so, you are pretty lucky to have it that fast.
Yes, SEPA is just for EU.

@_date: 2014-10-10 10:31:32
Wow, that's great.
Those your first 5 bitcoins or?
@_date: 2014-10-04 11:55:41
Just download Armory and take care of your bitcoins YOURSELF.
Blockchain is probably the best web based wallet (it's a hybrid actually) but still there is a vector where you trust 3rd party to not backdoor the script you download everytime you log-in. Well you can use the chrome extension but still, it's not as serious as Armory which is client you run on your own pc and is security focused.
Paper wallets are great to isolate yourself from internet threads, but what about the old world threads like robbery, fire and so on? You need a lot of back-ups of it, which increases the potential to be stolen and cashed out.
It's funny to use solution of the past as paper with the most advanced technology of money.
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:36:27
40% inflation in argentina, how much is the inflation in Russia at this point? 20-30%?

You have no idea about entrepreneurship,risk taking and following your dreams, do you?
This person wants to change his life because he us currently unhappy, it's many times better to try that and fail, than never actually trying. Because in his last hours he won't be sorry about his failures but about  the things he never tried.
It takes a lot of guts to make this decision and the last thing he needs know is someone with dead spirit to question his decision.
Show some support.
@_date: 2014-11-25 11:13:16

Well done. We have to show them by actions that this community won't take shit like that.
I loved what they tried to do in the first place, that's why I'm so disapointed they ruined it now.

We still have 4 months ahead of us which is 33% of the year. A little early to call it over, isn't it?
It will again finish at all time high but that won't last forever.

I'm seriously asking
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:02:58
What about the chargebacks though? How do they deal with those?
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:05:25
Well for the average retarded Joe that's better than trusting himself with the private key.
The key is that if someone wants to control the private keys he can. 
If he wants the convenience he can leave them there and hope everything turns out ok and the insurance is working.
@_date: 2014-10-10 18:53:01
woooho, that would be awesome!

@_date: 2014-10-03 09:54:43

How come not even creating his own video?
So he will do with 200k what xapo failed to do with 50M?
How come he will make the card from steel? Would that even work?
@_date: 2014-11-28 12:09:57
How come all the media claims Russia has got over 30% inflation just from the beginning of the year then?
Or 8.5% is the OFFICIAL inflation statet by the Russian government that has interest to lie?

Yes. until before bitcoin every digital token that did NOT rely on central authority keeping a ledger (database of who owns what) could be copied as many times as you like.
Bitcoin is the first to solve the fundamental "double spend" problem. That and the blockchain data structure are the actual innovations that made this currency possible.
Nobody could solve this problem before. That's why the founder is a pure genius!

What makes you think your opinion is absolut and true by the way?
I mean, you talk like some kind of authority that we should give a shit about.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:17:51
You are reading my mind!
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:36:07
I'm stopping this now because I overestimated your inteligence. 
It's especially obvious after you didn't understood AT ALL the first point you are citing here and also how you keep blabbing about buying bitoin on the top and then complaning why it isn't profitable later...
@_date: 2014-10-12 10:23:18
Well the game seems to be pretty much on now after that statement.
Hollywood has been fighting torrents for 10+ years now.
How do you think banks fight of p2p money will differ?
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:26:19
This will actually solve the 51% pool attack problem for good. We just need to make it more popular. It has about 1% of the mining power right now

They beat you with a big rubber baton until you give your encryption password.
If beating doesn't help, they shove that same baton repeatedly where sun doesn't shine often.
I imagine most drug dealers aren't tech savy much, so we don't even know if that guy used encryption at all.
@_date: 2014-08-27 09:49:51
It won't because the rapid increase in price will save most people bad investments.
As long as they don't sell the mined bitcoins immediatelly of course.
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:30:09
The article sounded like they've got the money already and about to put them in.
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:22:27
Well but how can a genuine dick behave like he isn't a dick?

This is why internet and bitcoin was invented, this singe site gives purpose of everything!!!
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:35:25
This is actually really clever, well done!

How can you trust cash when there are even more cases of it being stolen?
@_date: 2014-10-04 11:43:59
Yup, that's how I feel

You are indeed a gentleman.

@_date: 2014-11-06 12:20:16
If falling to it's intrinsic value of zero is inevitable to anything without intrinsic value why fiat hasn't went there already?
answer:  Both have functions, to store and transfer value. That in itself is useful enough and doesn't really need intrinsic value on top of it. Especially in a digital age.
Credit cards don't have intrinscit value, the electronic cash that they authorise you to spend doesn't have either. Still fiat and cards are widely used.
Bitcoin is much better than both of them.
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:47:15
we can't ask questions now? You forbid that?
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:22:46
yup, another crazy move
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:56:13
Well it's not perfect analogy for sure, but how come putting beautiful female bodies on a shirt becomes offensive? I think we are going to far with that politically correct shit.
If ugly women are offended because guys like beautiful women so much that they put them on a shirt, they should shut the fuck up about it and go back to the kitchen :)
I'm kidding (mostly) of course :)

I could use some.

Don't think most people care about that.

Well this price will be market price in few months. So he is just visionery :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:14:00
What you did, a chargeback? :)
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:10:57
He means his comment "Scumbag Gems. Guy values his privacy, Gems records the entire conversation and uploads it to Youtube." was a joke.
Anyway, i was hesitant if i should invest less or more and your explanation you did here helped me make my mind. I'll invest MORE :)
Just couple of hours before the end of the first period. I hope you guys earn enough to finish it as planned.
this is how telegram works pretty much but I guess you are familiar with it. Of course adding currency on top of it brings it to another level alltogether :)
now if you figure out how to decentralize the central server/servers part so that everyone can run a node and be compensated for it that will bring it even higher!
@_date: 2014-10-08 11:17:35
Yes because bitcoin price has been very stable last few days, omg
@_date: 2014-12-22 12:33:31
This news is coupel of weeks old
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:03:46
ATMs should profit from the fees so they shouldn't care about the price right? Because they just buy that from an exchange in real time to sell it to you with 1 to 5% mark-up?
@_date: 2014-11-24 13:18:56
He should have said he accepts blowjobs
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:49:52
the transaction fees are not monthly fees.
By monthly fee they mean the $5 you pay every month, no matter what. 
They will reimburse JUST THAT. Which is funny because they wrote it like they don't know for sure if there will be such fee. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:35:55
We will talk again
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:35:26

Yeah so the % you are citing is the official one.
Do you think that this basket of limited goods really represent the real inflation?
There is much more that people use and has increased more.
Especially the imported goods since a lot of them are traded in $
What if a Russian wants to travel abroad? He will be able to buy 30% less.
Also if you have held bitcoin for the last 2 years you would have made 10 000%
With your bank you would have made ~20%
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:20:30
So you are ok trusting your bitcoins to a company that does bitch moves like this?

Because it's not solution when a carder uses your card.
It only solves the problem with dishonest card owners that claim chargeback on their own card.

Now let's move to the actual question.

That's nice, thanks.
And now we need a graph to see if they touched

um, so what?
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:44:21
Well if to be ignorant as fuck is pretty normal for you, then I can see where you are coming from.
@_date: 2014-12-22 12:25:44
I do that all the time
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:26:06


Thanks but I meant the "This is gentlemen" joke
should have clarified
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:12:45
Because they are bought out!
And they don't take bitcoins for the ads, just for the gold.

That's a shame

It's not about someone not showing respect to your stupid browser....omg

It's kind of you sharing that.
On a sidenote is there a reason for the raspberry B+ to be $40 when it's $35 with free shipping on ebay.
With the 15% discount it matches the ebay price but that's 1 day in the year.
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:37:39
Is that huge or what?
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:07:37
Ok, i'll have just cookies then. Hey it's something!

@_date: 2014-10-02 10:26:52
Ok, circle allows almost worldwide, coinbase to half the world, where is the mutha fuckin buy pressure?
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:31:48
Well, I didn't mean to offense you specifically but just to make my point that people often stress about minor stuff when there might be an elephant in the room. 
And while design and colors have their part, if a user has to submit his birth certificate, finger prints, retina scan and mail in an anal sample, even the most heaven like colors won't help :)
@_date: 2014-09-27 10:07:38
yeah right, can't do it, i'm hooked up.

@_date: 2014-10-29 11:48:38
I imagine major hurdle for most people will be if they have to submit ID/utility bill/whatever before being able to buy with card.
I would imagine that is wall for like 90% of the people that can't be bothered with that shit.
So, since I don't know german and can't test the site, my question is how does your conversion funnel looks like?
How many and what steps are necessary until the user gets bitcoins into his own wallet?
Buying bitcoin with credit card is very rare service, only circle and bittylicious do it as far as I know, so there should be demand, unless it's not too hard.
I realize it's very hard to provide that without the security checks because of the carders, and even Circle that are so well funded are struggling to find balance between security and actual usability.
So, I would look into that.
Bullshit like background color and the like mentioned here, are several orders of magnitude less important than that.
If you provide smooth credit card buying experience people will buy from that site even if there are swastikas all over it :)
Or at least that is my very humble view.
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:01:59


U looking for trouble?
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:49:35
oh, so I guess you work only with US customers. I see.
What are the limits of those transfers by the way?
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:15:29
Where is that graph from?
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:35:20
Call the food control agency on them
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:16:24
I believe most merchants keep like 10%
Overstock keeps 10% for example as  confrimed by them
It's a safe and reasonable thing to do for a business. Most are conservative.
So, 50% of them keep 10%. That's like 5% of the total is kept in bitcoin.
Not much, but I suppose most are hodlers, so 5% of the spent bitcoins are taken out of circulation.
It's something.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:19:27
u r fat bro

The idea of free market is that nothing is illegal there.
True freedom comes with major responsibilities but it's fun :)

@_date: 2014-09-19 10:38:09
This is the funniest thing I've seen in the last 23 days!
@_date: 2014-11-29 12:38:05
Well even the ones of the site above state that some might be made in China and some in UK, they don't guarantee which one will send.
It doesn't really matter in this case.
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:13:18
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:57:20
Yes, he just needs cheap way to buy the bitcoins. For such amounts best bet would be an exhange. Because buying that from people face to face is full time job in itself.
Btc-e has a lot of ways for Russians to load fiat.

@_date: 2014-09-03 08:38:36
Why people keep using old conceptions to secure conceptually new stuff? Putting gold in a safe I understand. But with bitcoin there are so much better ways to protect them against both theft and losing them. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 20:13:34
i'm stealing that!
@_date: 2014-11-24 13:15:13
Should we start a petition asking google to include bitcoin in that experiment? 
I believe it will be easier to make them do that while it's in development as of RIGHT NOW.
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:55:37
Well i Imagine that's for both usability and letting you lock in a price.
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:46:58
Hey, it's not like we are still mad at you guys for that.
Actually I'm going to watch this tonight
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:20:46
So the saying there is no bad PR is actually not true.
Terrorist related PR is actually bad? :)
@_date: 2014-11-18 10:34:48
That's really cool!
Bitcoin and lasers, feels good to live in the future!
@_date: 2014-10-01 09:42:53
you serious?
@_date: 2014-11-04 11:42:01
Hey will be even more fun if you put "Donation to the terorirst organisation ISIS. Also some cocaine and money laundering, got couple of slaves too." 
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:40:15
Entire? yeah right
@_date: 2014-12-22 12:23:51
Well they had a temp problems with few hundreds of addresses (their fault) and few man in the middle attacks from tor (not their fault really), but overall they are really good service. Better than most actually.
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:02:17
Wise words and that's why I invest in everything that makes sense by bringing something new to the table. It's natural some of the tried out stuff to not make it eventually. It's all part of the game.
Actually I have fair sized investment in ETH, and is really interesting to follow this discussion. I'm not worried, since even if some of project fail to get traction, in the open source community that's still a win. Good code is produced and can be re-used or inspire the next step.
The end result? The whole ecosystem wins. One way or another.
@_date: 2014-12-08 12:44:22
The comment is even more "great" :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:15:40

@_date: 2014-08-04 11:19:24
source showing he didn't actually raise the money?
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:31:50
I see. Thanks for claryfying.
I suppose if there is certificate for a given domain already issued by anyone, the attacker won't be able to get another one for the very same domain?
@_date: 2014-12-22 12:39:52
When his bank is jumping aboard and how much will they invest.
I need exact figures :)
@_date: 2014-12-10 12:28:10
If it stays stable for some time it will go mainstream much faster and that will make the price unstable and go up again. 
So you can't really have both at this point.
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:48:35
How come you don't get into any details about the research outcome. GIve us more data to prove it.
@_date: 2014-09-11 11:26:51
What's good to buy there if you are abroad?
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:00:41
omg that was pretty funny actually
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:24:58
Someone said like 1-2 years ago that over 50% of bitcoin companies will fail.
We are watching this now, and I think it's normal part of the free market.
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:18:50
Paying is not free to use, because you've got the monthly fee.
And 3% currency conversion, when it's not clear what's the native currency of the card?
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:20:53
and reddit is free and much more informative :)

Easily the best article about bitcoin i've ever read! 
So, objective, much to the point!
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:10:38
ok, that's embarassing, sorry! :)
@_date: 2014-11-28 11:40:51

@_date: 2014-11-06 20:54:00
Well most retailers make their money even selling at the normal price just because they get stuff cheaper.
I can buy it at $399 and get it delivered everywhere anyway.
I would buy you from you for the convenience to use bitcoin if the price was the same, but i'n not paying premium for the "privilege" to use bitcoin.
It's supposed to be the other way around.
@_date: 2014-08-04 11:21:29
What you are missing is that we are not mad about the fees. But about the LIE.
They build a hype for 3 months about a no fees card and then hammered the users.
Are  you ok to entrust your bitcoins to company that does that??

@_date: 2014-10-11 10:40:04
I can't believe you are using the excuse government officials are using to take away our privacy and freedoms.
If someone is hosting anything illegal suspend him and give whatever info you have about him to the authorities.
Don't treat all your customers like criminals because of the misbehaving 0.01%
It's bad business and you will quickly turn into the most hated company around.
There are plenty of hosts that take bitcoin and none of them asks for ID or credit card on top of it.
Let me ask you something, if you were selling hammers on the street and someone comes and buys one with cash. Would you ask him for ID to put it on record too, because he can use the hammer to hit someone?
2014 is the year when people finally started paying attention to their privacy and realized it's being invaded, if you start asking bitcoin users for ID you will get a lot of bad PR.
If you just start accepting bitcoin you will get good PR and good new business.

Of course this is misleading because right now it's mostly air after $400 and more limit sell orders will appear as the price go up, but still kinda funny how little (for the conventional financial world) is enough to rock our world.

@_date: 2014-11-05 13:28:05
Good story, thanks for sharing!
Another option is that the other side has their online banking hacked, or as you said comitting fraud.
Either case it's amazing how sometimes even bank wire can be reversed.
So, only cash and bitcoin are not succeptable to chargebacks at the end of the day

You are one of those that can't be proven wrong, no matter the arguments, aren't you?
1. Richard Branson has talked publicly about bitcoin number of times and he is really into it. We don't know if he holds but that's irrelevant.
2. Shouldn't Oprah also care for something trending to fill her show with? Or if it doesn't make her money directly she can be bothered.
Come on.

oh and also If I'm not mistaken the first use limit is 60 euro, that would be the 3rd turn off for me as a customer
so we have
* 1. 14 days wait, omg I don't even know where i'll be after half month
* 2. i have to submit sensitive stuff to not established site, meh, well i could do it but only if it's really worth it fast and convinient and there isn't easier way
* 3. all that for just 60 euro, omg come on,  fuck that shit, i'm out of here and maybe just buy some heroin of silk road, they don't want any of that shit. 
just an example of the thoughts of an average customer :)
@_date: 2014-10-08 11:18:02
Good enough for me :)

I suppose not requesting ID and selfie with the ID is impossible nowadays, but do you really need to wait 14 days? I suppose this is to check if a chargeback will show up but I guess they can do them anyway for much longer than that?
Those 2 (sending ID and the wait) are the biggest turn off for most people, I'm pretty sure.
If the 14 days wait is not required by the banks I would drop it and count just on the ID and selfie.
Now while ID scans are easy to find online, selfie with the ID in hand I haven't seen for sale. And that's actually something the user can do within seconds with his smartphone so it should be the lesser turn off. 
So, my humble advice would be, drop the 14 days wait if possible,  make the selfie submission as automatic as possible, like the user pulls up his ID, his phone, snaps him and instantly sends it FROM the phone to you with couple of moves.
if he has to connect the phone to his PC or download from dropbox.......you just lost another 10-20-30% conversions. 
you will always have some level of fraud, but since they charge you high 5% for processing, there should be some room for that, right?
Do they tell you what % of chargebacks will be tolerated?
@_date: 2014-11-06 11:35:18
That's cool but why the 10% mark-up though? 
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:54:23

Your arguments are invalid because you are supposed to negotiate terms with the card issuer before telling everyone it will be free.
Also the monthly fee is for sure going for them, since no card charges mothly fee.

After this video I can confidently say "BITCOIN IS MAINSTREAM NOW"
@_date: 2014-10-15 15:54:04

Yes that would definitely be more secure way to do it but not the only one. Also it's a way that often leads to terrible amounts of procrastination because you are in your zone of COMFORT. Determined man can do literally MIRACLES if pushed to the wall. Burning the bridge behind you (leaving your old job just like that man did) is hell of a motivation to not fail or procrastinate. Yes it's the more risky way to do it I agree, but it also has the potential for higher return.
Since you are pointing the finger at me now, let me ask you this.
What do you do for a living right now? No need to be specific, just tell me if you work for someone or for yourself?
Let me answer first, I've been working for myself for over a decade now. I have some slight idea about risk taking and following your dreams.

@_date: 2014-08-25 10:05:40
Omg, this guy got so many things wrong. Bitcoin exchanges are NOT banks. They are not supposed to lend money. They are basically markets where the only comodity is bitcoin. You go there to buy or sell your bitcoins, that's it. It's no deposit account. 
Not to mention it will be highly illegal for them to operate as banks without the proper licenses. 
And creating bitcoin out of thin air is not nocessary to meet demand and create liquidy. If the demand is higher than the supply, the price will raise until enough people are ok to sell at that price and then you get the liquidy. It's called free market. 
I can't believe they let this stupid person to write for forbes...

If you understand the technology and believe in it, it's not reckless, it's the only way to not be sorry when you look back few years from now and realize you've missed (probably) yet another opportunity.
I have to admit that i'm biased since i've got even more invested but I believe that bitcoin has the potential of the internet in 94 so for me it's a no brainer.
Still, someties i get cold chills but just for a bit.

yes, i'm feeling the pain even right now
@_date: 2014-10-27 11:58:34
Well I didnt understand since you invest bitcoins with them, do you get back bitcoins even if the price of bitcoin increases?
If that's the case it would be pretty neat but I doubt it.
Also I wouldn't mind paying 2% for the convenience of investing with bitcoins directly from my sofa, as long as it stays in bitcoins for me.
Because if you gain 10% on your stocks, but miss gain of 30% on bitcoin, because your bitcoins were converted in dollars there isn't much point.
@_date: 2014-10-18 12:26:59
Oh thank god it was about time!
@_date: 2014-08-04 11:27:54
That they builded hype with a no fee card for 3 months just to switch after shipment. Are you ok with trusting your bitcoins to a company that does that?
@_date: 2014-10-25 13:36:56
Yup, exactly!
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:19:16
and? 
@_date: 2014-12-11 13:12:27
How using both methods at once helps though?
They have strong initiative to sort it out themselves to get the extra money locked.
Or the arbiter is just like second backup?
@_date: 2014-11-13 10:59:21
You are indeed a gentleman.
100 bits
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:17:43
here ukranian friend 1000 bits for you
stay safe there!

@_date: 2015-05-08 12:00:31
Beautiful. Android app much?
@_date: 2015-05-01 11:30:30
thanks 
here is a donut for you
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:53:57
ok tell me the hybrid web wallets that are more secure? and tell me at least few of them.
yeah, i thought so
@_date: 2014-11-15 13:10:26
Ok if it's that easy how many bitcoins I have right now?
Yeah you can monitor random amounts on random addresses but how you are connecting that to real world identities on an usable scale?
Waiting for the money to get to address owned by an exchange where the owner is verified? Ok, how you know which address is owned by an exchange? 
The only way I see it would work if an government agency has real time access to all addresses generated by exchanges.
I would like someone to prove me wrong though, since this is just of the top of my head.
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:22:24
so, you think the $5 monthly fee isn't pure profit for XAPO? :)
@_date: 2014-08-26 09:09:42
The problem is the lenders are from all over the globe. Quick glance shows a lot of them in Indonesia. Collect that :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 10:44:31
so 553 to the moon?
@_date: 2014-10-20 11:13:17
If you believe this has potential as big as the internet in 94 you know this is once in a lifetime opportunity for most so it seems natural to then invest BIG. 
That's how I feel about it, i've invested BIG for sure and don't look at it as a gamble but an incredible opportunity.
Of course investment is just part of it for me, I'm also developing business in the ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:38:21
I'm sending you a donut right now.
Let's see what happens.
@_date: 2015-05-21 09:40:57
So you say sink in the title and then believe that you will lose them...
if you are so negative about it why invest at all?
and how someone that is supposedly familiar with it can be so negative about it
@_date: 2015-05-27 11:05:54
I was one of the ones that really disliked their card fees move but now I'm turning around to like them AGAIN.
@_date: 2015-05-19 14:24:59
yeah ok, but what are the differences in practical terms for a layman like me?
@_date: 2015-05-14 12:34:11
Can't find it in the torrents just yet
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:56:29
to be honest, this problem was result of the combining of 2 outside factors going wrong at the same time.
yes, they could have done better, but come on, it's not a stupid mistake really
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:47:53
I was wondering the same thing, but so far no :(
It's funny the slogan there "A new way to bank"  yeah but with the old fees :)
@_date: 2015-05-28 11:55:34
Someone would do this whole neat site just to troll Ethereium?
There has to be more here?!
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:14:04
so, basically dumb fucks? :)
@_date: 2015-05-11 12:21:56
dafuq? that is a joke right?
@_date: 2015-05-17 11:50:18
I see.
 What i want to know is, is he more the philosophical type of bla bla author or more to the point real useful shit one?
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:30:40
Turned out they couldn't deliver the terms they promised before launch and everyone hates them now.
@_date: 2015-05-02 13:37:19
That's fucking great!
@_date: 2014-10-21 09:55:52
Definitely. It's not about me.  It's about changing the fuckin world.

But shouldn't true democracy give the freedom to people to make stupid choices as well?
I mean if someone starts to decide for you to prevent you from doing something stupid it goes a slippery slope down to where we are now
@_date: 2015-05-28 11:36:17
it has 1% load fee I believe? or was it 2%?
and some other fees too
@_date: 2015-05-14 12:16:45
Arizona is famous with it's moon rockets right?
Coincidence? Don't think so!

I actually have a an online bitcoin project that takes and pays 100% in bitcoin only. Everything, from hosting to employees is paid in bitcoin. 
It's easy actually. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 10:52:40
But you are smart enough to admit that like an intelligent human being so you deserve at least a donut :)
@_date: 2015-05-15 10:28:25
I couldn't help but notice that this girl has enormous boobs.
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:01:31
I'm not expert so please help me understand that.
Even if the sites uses https, what stops the man in the middle attacker to just hijack your dns query and serve you his own fake version of the WHOLE site which is again https.
He would copy the original site, change the bitcoin address, host it and serve it himself to the target encrypted as well.
It's harder of coruse but other than that is anything else that makes this not viable?
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:24:03
Here is an advice.
Kill'em all.
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:57:21
Well I guess it's good that bitcoin uses sha-256 from the start :)
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:36:28
yes I got the obvious but thought there is more to that?
Like for example why are they not included yet?
@_date: 2014-08-04 11:28:17
no, they builded hype with a no fee card for 3 months just to switch after shipment. Are you ok with trusting your bitcoins to a company that does that?
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:25:11
not really, it's fine. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 20:10:17
you forget the anal sample
@_date: 2015-05-19 14:34:39
This picture is as historic as this one 
only difference is the now we are talking about real shit
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:48:41
no donut for you
@_date: 2014-10-15 11:55:52
I'm actually going to try to understand that. Wish me luck! :)
yes I do have math background. But it's really just a background :)
@_date: 2014-11-13 11:03:58
Your art is great, do you sell high res images that can be printed and put on a wall?
@_date: 2015-05-27 11:06:36
He said that only few months ago. What did you expect?
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:04:11
well if it's not from sepa exchange to sepa account it might take up to 5 days and there are 15 to $50 in fees.
also it helps to hunt for a bank that offers free to use debit cards
@_date: 2015-05-13 07:54:41
and if it didn't work at all it will be called "scam"
@_date: 2015-05-08 11:48:44
Isn't that pretty good indication that when the coin ETF and Swedish NASDAQ kick in, conventional investors will be ready to really push the price high?
@_date: 2015-05-19 14:40:19
Well I thought you knew.
Otherwise I would have checked myself.
Nah, wait, too busy with other shit to do that now. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 11:35:14
Because load fees are not that uncommon (not that I like the $10 load fee, it's very high)
charging the customer at the POS is very rare because the merchant pays up to 3% as well.
@_date: 2014-11-21 09:45:23
$5 fee to send up to $50
so in best case you get charged 10%
even mafia charges less
@_date: 2015-05-09 11:52:29
You have no idea how much I agree :)
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:15:02
Paying 10% premium for the privilege of using bitcoin? I think that was not the original idea.
@_date: 2015-05-29 10:30:39
You have a gift for explaining complicated stuff in simple terms.
Made it clear for me too. Very clear!
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:34:07
usb sticks tend to corrupt themselves

Here is a crazy idea.
Keep you private key secure. :)
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:06:22
They don't say how one can check if he has been affected?
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:21:30
That pretty much sums it up yeah
@_date: 2015-05-07 12:42:35
@_date: 2015-05-01 11:49:51
Steve is really cool :)
@_date: 2014-11-27 10:22:09
Did you notice how ignorant, stupid and morronic most answers are?
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:11:27
Actually when you have something as big as bitcoin I agree one should make changes very very carefully and planning well ahead.
It's the smart thing to do.
@_date: 2015-05-27 10:49:20
How can people be that stupid?
@_date: 2015-05-01 11:48:42
It's coming. I kinda can feel it.
@_date: 2014-10-20 11:45:08
Those videos are great, really well explained!
@_date: 2017-02-20 12:45:38
ok you win :)
@_date: 2014-11-05 13:19:21
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:27:34
smart way to put things in another perspective :)
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:29:38
You are kinda saying it as everyone on the planet uses iPhone.
Those guys don't even have android version, neither web one.
As mentioned what i like about blockchain.info is that it is very convenient (you can use the same wallet on your PC and phone) and has above average security even with the occasional problems.
@_date: 2014-12-11 13:32:04
The guy that replied that
"I seriously doubt it. Maybe in 5-10 years if Bitcoin or some other form of crypto-currency becomes mainstream, maybe. I was genuinely surprised when they started taking PayPal, tbh. "
was so wrong, haha
@_date: 2014-09-08 11:26:05
What you say is all true and logical. There is just one "small" thing you are missing. People don't need to understand it in order to use, they might not even know bitcoin technology is underneath the new system that allows them to send money everywhere in the world instantly. And this is just one of the uses. As soon as the tools allowing the average Joe to use bitcoin without even knowing it, mature, we will have a homerun. 
Example, most people have no idea how electricity works but they use it all the time, right?
We just need simple tools for the masses, that's it. And those are being built as we speak here. 
Infact like 250M have been invested in those tools just this year.
@_date: 2015-05-01 12:23:40
priceless :)
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:00:24
I'll take it
@_date: 2015-05-19 10:48:39
What is the difference? (i'm 5 years old)
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:15:12
that's exactly NOT true
xapo and bit-x are the only 2 cards at the moment that have bitcoin balance and sell bitcoins in real time to cover the transaction
@_date: 2015-05-15 10:30:18
I would pay few bitcoins to get a ride on that baby. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:41:39
Bitcoin hookers?
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:19:57
Most servers are linux and most phones are linux (android is linux)
so it became mainstream without average Joe even knowing
cool, huh?
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:15:24
what if technology is fo far ahead that there simply isn't much to do for the humans?
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:48:25
it's easy to say that now
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:49:57
He also seems to have interesting books. Anyone read any of them? Recommendations?
I'm thinking of reading BOLD
@_date: 2015-05-19 14:43:08
This sounds great but if someone can explain us like we are 5, how exactly it benefits us in practical terms. Except of course, legitimacy. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 14:29:53
So, why we are not at the fucking moon yet?!
This is like the 10th moon-like-event in last few months. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:53:14
I completely agree most people are idiots and shouldn't have a say in anything important BUT current model where a lot of power is concentrated in very few people is extremely well proven NOT to work.
Even psychologists agree that when you give a single (or limited group) man power, psychological changes start to make their way and after a while he is ready to do more and more to preserve and increase that power. 
In short, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts... (finish that)
Anyway, what I'm saying is that neither of those systems is perfect but we know for a fact that the current one is terrible. Direct democracy will come with its own advantages and disadvantages and I have no illiusions it will be the final one.
It will be just a stepping stone to new form of organising people living together that we might have not even imagined yet.
Of course, direct democracy might not even come as an intermediate, this is just a baseless speculation on my part. 
But whatever it is the blockchain data structure finally gives the way for people to try new ways!
@_date: 2015-05-21 20:18:47
ah yes. Ok the question now is is the google play client susceptible to this kind of encryption downgrade?
@_date: 2015-05-29 10:33:02
lol. Give me one technology implementation that never had any problems?
The advantage of widely used ones and open source ones is that those problems are found faster and taken care of. 
That's how it goes in real world. In your imaginery one there might be 100% secure shit that never goes bad. This is the real world. Deal with it.
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:39:47
I came, I ate their lunches, I won!
@_date: 2015-05-01 10:25:04
yes this is a valid concern
@_date: 2015-05-05 11:03:06
Can someone sum up the OP in one sentence?
There will be donut for him.
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:14:25
but the dumb fucks are the majority?
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:26:15
Of course they aren't.
I look at them as you would look at real life wallet.
You wouldn't store your life savings in the leather wallet in your back pocket right?
But you will gladly store up to several hundred dollars there just because of the convenience?
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:07:22
Not quite.
If you sell your bitcoins at any of those 2 exchanges you will withdraw the fiat. But the buyer of your bitcoins will be stuck with them in his exchange account.
So I don't see how a single bitcoin will leave any of those 2 exchanges in this month.
@_date: 2015-05-01 11:41:54
fuck them. Behaviour like that should be met with outrage in the community.
patent fucking trolls.
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:26:45
You are a smart man and you are really interested in politics?
Don't you think that currency is only the very first application of bitcoin and one of the next one will be giving power back to the people through the magic of direct democracy? And politicians will be quite obsolete.  
After all they are just another middle men, like the banksters and everyone else that will be made obsolete by trustless peer to peer interactions. 
Well, there will be time before that happens, so I guess you are hoping to work in that interval, but still there should be better things to do.
@_date: 2015-05-08 11:40:15
one of the many things sports teach you is sticking to it.
@_date: 2015-05-09 12:46:44
Looks really promising! We are looking forward to it! :)
@_date: 2015-05-02 08:24:29
That's explained in the video too.
That leads to a fork. People will stay on peoples blockchain. 
Please really, people watch the video before commenting, it's not long.
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:41:51
Yes, but they are crazy expensive.
If you can open bank acc for free and get a free debit card with it, what's your beef?
@_date: 2014-08-21 09:04:06
So it's money when they have to send you to jail but isn't money when this means you will pay less taxes and use it easier? Nicely played!

"Beating you with a baton" attack will always be possible and they always will get back to it.
The good thing here is that there isn't a single person in control of anything that they can intimidate. 
You can't intimidate technology with all the batons in the world. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 08:50:40
What is he saying now?
@_date: 2015-05-14 12:16:05
We need options like that for that people that don't need or appreciate privacy.
The ones that do, just don't use them. Plenty of other options.
@_date: 2014-09-11 11:28:07
How would one buy them though? Card, wire?

For even crazier 1% POS fee?
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:53:58
How come they always announce shit like that when the price has been briefly over $1000?
@_date: 2017-02-13 17:34:45
duh, of course?! 
I was just clarifying that it seemed like you thought bitcoins can leave the exchanges by being sold. Anyway.....
@_date: 2014-09-04 10:03:51
If you are just an investor ok, but if you are enterpreneur, your next vacation will be like 5 years from now.
Now is the time to innovate and build shit!
@_date: 2015-05-01 12:26:34
It's very nice of you to put the time to make that site.
Please have a donut.
@_date: 2015-05-28 11:37:51
If you load $1000 at a time those $10 are effectively 1%
of course it's better to just pay 1%
or use xapo and pay 0% a the POS as it should be
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:14:53
Yes they have had problems but they are also the most used hybrid web wallet and problems are seen faster when a lot of people use it.
Using another web wallet that never has been in the news for issues doesn't mean they don't have any. They just might not have been found.
Blockchain.info tickes a lot of boxes for me, security and convenience wise for small to medium amounts of storage. 
However, if you know wallets with that level of convenience that are better I'll be glad to look them up.
And I'm talking about everyday wallets, not cold storage. For that I have Armory.
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:21:17
ah, ok
@_date: 2015-05-11 16:57:46
if you have the brains to get to 800 btc you better have the brains to secure them, right?

Thank you for this great explanation!

Like 90% bitcoin income now.
Spending is still rather cumbersome, but that will change in just few months
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:38:54
It will be $5000 before the end of the year, so 10k in 3 years seems rather conservative.
No, I don't have any proof, just speculating.
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:47:39
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:23:31

One dochebag talking about another (bigger) douchebag. Priceless.
The chest hair isn't helping either!
I can't wait for the ecosystem to mature enough and weed out this kind of characters. Idiots with money and ego.
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:11:29
What you do is nice but not competitive for EU customers. Since SEPA wire to bank account with debit card tied to it is like 1 euro.
And there are banks that give free cards with no ATM withdraw fee. 
So bitcoin to cash, costs 1 euro in total and takes 1 to 2 days max.
But I understand that this is hard to beat. 
Now if you have something that goes bitcoin to card instantly (maybe with your own card?), even with some fees, that would be acceptable. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:18:44
Yeah this Karpales guy looks like bigger and bigger piece of shit by the day.
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:08:31
I see. That's great!
Any plans to make Wordpress or any major shopping cart plug-in?
I'm asking because for example there is WP plug-in that takes advantage of blockchain.info to provide super simple/few clicks integration.
Also as far as I know with blockchain.info they don't have the private keys since they are encrypted on the user side.  They are basically providing the bitcoind and web interface for you to use them. That seems to be good enough for a lot of people.
But if we have that ease and functionallity with your solution, well it will be even better! 
Just sharing my thoughts, hoping it helps at least a bit. Since what you do is really nice.

Not the defense, but one of the  witnesses that was undercover cop mentioned that they thought it might be him at first.

What about the wordpress plug-in?

Here are some questions from me
 What documents are necessary and what citizens can apply? Non-UK? Non-EU? 
What would be the anual fees and taxes?
How to open bank account once the company is done?
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:46:37
you are the shit man!
@_date: 2015-01-10 13:25:09
Yeah Russians are good at this shit. Bravo BTC-E!
@_date: 2015-05-13 07:58:23
i wouldn't mind that at all
@_date: 2015-05-27 22:12:42
Bitstamp this is nice but the $10 or 2% load fee is a BIG turn off for the community.
Also you are not saying how long it takes for the funds to be available for spending. 
And having fee for spending at POS is a bit over the top too.
For a second I was excited about this. Now I'm just sad. :)
@_date: 2015-01-09 10:21:55
You should try at stand up comedy :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:17:30
Your post gave me idea about that I just posted here. Feel free to provide your input since you should have quite the expeirence.
@_date: 2015-01-10 13:10:19
Anyone up to sum the report for me in just one sentence?
Yeah I'm that busy :) (and cocky)

@_date: 2015-05-29 09:38:00
Feels about right. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 11:57:25
I see, now that i've discussed it, it's much more clear, thank you! :)
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:52:17
That sucks. I'm tired of being descriminated on a bitcoin basis.
Can't wait this period to finish.
@_date: 2015-05-07 14:40:19
Would you explain a bit more on that?
I don't understand why?
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:18:02
You keep 180BTC in an exchange?
Have you heard about mtgox?
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:43:54
I haven't looked into this one deeply, but can you summary for me and others what are the advantages compard to running your own bitcoind or just using the blockchain API?
@_date: 2015-01-17 11:31:17
I think it's to late to cover it :)
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:48:16
Well I overstated a bit, she just has this high pitched voice that reminds me of my GF and she drives me crazy when talks like that :)

You missed the most important bit of information, until what price your operation will be viable?
And even then I suppose the mining farms in China have good 50-60% margin below that.
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:23:43
very good point!
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:15:41
So, that fee is a feature now? lol, that's priceless!

at the current difficulty 
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:13:34
I'm lazy to do that, but I bet many people will be interested if they do an AMA here.
A lot of bitcoin businesess are looking for friendly jurisdictions to incorporate. (and UK is decent one)
A lot of them are also nerds and don't know much about legacy offline business world and burocracy.
So, they can tell us a lot if they want and get a lot of new business.
Just saying.

You don't have to use them. It's an option. It's good to have regulated options for regulation demanding users.
There are plenty of unregulated wallets and exchanges as well. So there is something for everyone, right?
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:12:25

If you can't beat them, join them.
Well done bank!
@_date: 2015-01-10 12:35:11
So you will be using a card after all. Do I need to say more?
okpay card fees are comparable to the fees of a lot of cards issued directly by bank in your own country.
That's why I was asking about them.
Most other cards have stupid fees.
And if bitcoin&gt;okpay&gt;card&gt;cash  takes faster than exchange site&gt;wire&gt;bank&gt;card&gt;cash
Why not?
@_date: 2015-01-07 10:37:40
Even the whitest hat hacker would turn black for $5M I suppose :)

They are not quite better because you won't have secuire enviroment to use them in. 
Hardware solution will always be better as in more secure, but not always better in usability.

What needs to be provided to get your account verefied and how long it takes?
About the supermarket, it's nice too! Do you ship to the whole EU and how is shipping generally calculated?

Hey that's great, thank you!
@_date: 2015-01-09 10:05:50
The 2 days transfer is a huge deal breaker.
Most US and Europe people can just make a wire from an exchange to their own bank account with card tied to it within a day.
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:54:06
Yes know about them. They used to have 3% conversion fee even when used on POS whch makes it unpractical for use in non-USD countries.
Don't see this fee now though?
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:44:28
Got issues?
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:54:52
uhm, Hitler was speaking german right?
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:28:54
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-05-04 11:10:03
I agree
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:24:16
thanks for the explanation
please have a donut for it
@_date: 2015-05-15 10:32:30
I do. It's nice.
@_date: 2015-01-29 11:13:49
How long it takes to withdraw to card and what are the fees?
There are typos in the texts by the way
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:01:52
Ok, that makes it pretty neat out of the box cold storage solution then. 
Just couple questions I'm sure many have in their heads.
Is there a business model behind this or it's just contribution to the community?
Will there be documentation on how to check if such modified distributions have been backdoored in case some people want to use it online too?
@_date: 2015-05-13 07:55:25
Am I supposed to just read up all those just because you posted them here without explaining anything? 
yeah ok
btw, bintcongress project was abandoned (I really liked it)
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:02:10
Fine with me
@_date: 2015-01-24 11:54:16
Because as long as your solution is software only it can be uploaded and retrieved from anywhere.
You can't download a hardware wallet though.
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:14:01
I think we are at Panic, but the price feels more like capitulation.
Well I thought it won't go further down at 255 as well so....
Well, interesting times

Karpeles was never rich because he spent all on fancy lattes. Everyone knows that :)
@_date: 2015-01-29 11:34:35
He used to be big fan of it, now that....
@_date: 2015-01-17 11:35:17
I understand. Overall it's really good article clear and easy to follow and I like that. 
We could use more of those for sure since most bitcoin people are not the type that's into economics and we could use people that can present this otherwise boring stuff in an interesting way as you did!
Me personally, I would love to learn more about money velocity, how is it measured, and stuff like that :)
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:30:22
omg the best thing i've seen in my stupid life!
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:00:42

@_date: 2015-01-28 12:06:11
Did you buy the Tesla with bitcoins too? 
@_date: 2015-01-16 10:17:43
This article makes sense for the most part but one thing. He assumes all the 13M+ bitcoins are to be used for the transaction volume and derrives the price by dividing the total transaction volume by 13M.
Truth is most of those are out of the market, and all the current transactions are done with fraction of that.
Other smaller thing is he just takes the daily volume and divides it by 4 just because he thinks not all transaction are real ones (like real economic transactions) 
The number 4 comes from the air.
So, if that number is not 4, but for example 2. (whch is alco quite pesimistic I believe) 
And not all 13M bitcoins are used to transact but 1M
His estimations will be 26 times less than the actual ones (mine are based on air too) 
His highest one is $266 (which accidentelly matches what was thought to be bottom) and if we multilpe that by 26 we will get potential price of 1 BTC of $6916
So, all those articles are fun though excercizes but just 2 small assumption can throw them off by a factor of 26 as I just showed.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:33:06
I know, i'm just pointing at another solution and asking if someone has integrated it and what is his experience. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:39:52
That would make it 21 bitcoins.
Damn, I'm ahead on this one
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:47:36
That's what I'm asking, someone that did it might share about the fees.
I think circle doesn't withdraw to non-us cards?
Thanks for sharing your insight on what's smart and what not. While bank wires are of course better, cards have their use cases too. Don't make the mistake thinking that your narrow view can see the use cases for all people and enforce your "smart" opinion on them.
For example I would like you to see make a wire to yourself while travelling or missing a price jump because you had to sell and wire 2 days early.  Not counting the weekend.
And many other situations. 
Having a card doesn't mean you can't do wires anymore, it's just another tool.
@_date: 2017-02-02 10:06:35
Simple but priceless joke :)
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:56:28
2 of the 3 biggest exchanges have all bitcoins that were there, stuck for at least a month. So, the totalitarian government can seize them at any time. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 12:48:48
Ah I see.
Yeah makes sense to use as ready out of the box cold storage system I guess.
Is everything else ubuntu wise untouched?
From your experience is it somewhat usable when booted from USB 2.0? 
@_date: 2015-01-23 12:42:27
It's more a problem of carrying around 2nd hardware device.  Not time or money problem.
One of the advantages of bitcoin for me is that you can be entirely in the cloud. You could travel naked and still retrieve money when provided with internet access.
Being able to sign only with hardware device limits that freedom. 
It's more of a philosophical concern at this point but still fun to think about.
@_date: 2015-05-17 11:52:04

Please describe in detail.

Wise move! Now buy some more and enjoy every second of it!
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:29:56
not to send, to receive wires while raveling
@_date: 2015-05-05 11:09:10
So they hold 2 of the 3 keys and they are not open source.
What the fuck are they thinking?
Sexy design though. People will buy it anyway.
@_date: 2015-01-29 11:22:03
Timeframe is like this
Day 1 they approve the ETF
Day 2 bitcoin is on the moon.
Day 3 dancing like there is no one watching
True story!
@_date: 2016-03-17 21:29:10
They do that for every country how?
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:10:18
Is there some sort of campaign we can do to convince them? 
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:09:36
Why would one need ubuntu with 4 wallets pre-installed?
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:05:13
Great! Thank you for this project and your contribution to the community. That's exactly the kind of things we need! 
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:21:52
It needs to have the opiton to be spent everywhere but a lot of peope to be choosing to hodl anyway. Then price goes in that direction ^
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:09:27
Uber and airbnb here I come
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:38:28
Ok, what other option we have for instant buy then?
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:17:34
you are the one who created those?
have a donut please
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:39:31
Somebody explain me, how stupid and self-unaware you have to be to act experty-like on this subject if just less than an year ago ~700k bitcoins growed legs on your watch? Come on.....
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:14:46
I'm sure they will have that covered somehow.
In the meantime just in case sign-up for some martial arts lessons :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:46:32
yeah pretty much that's it
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:57:09
What documents are necessary and what citizens can apply? Non-UK? Non-EU?
How to open bank account once the company is done?
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:27:50
Or it means you don't undertand the curve at all? :)

I'm hodling, you?
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:37:46
Don't settle!
@_date: 2016-01-10 11:55:51
That is much needed because there is big disconnection between China and the west.
@_date: 2014-11-20 10:51:50
Actually you can't.
99% of the prices are pegged to usd or euro.
@_date: 2015-05-20 11:52:40
Would be nice to have list of the features at a glance. I barely managed to watch 3 mins of the video.
So, seems like it just takes paper wallets to the next step making them magnetic wallets?
I was kinda hoping to be able to pay to nfc readers like mastercard paypas and visa paywave. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 10:22:41
hm, actually yes
do most web wallets support those?
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:33:24
I would like to also know

you are a poet
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:57:30
yes but dumb people are easier to misguide :)
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:17:24
Do they require UK or German resident address or any in EU will do?
How do you prove your residency/citizenship?

I like this guy sense of humour :)
@_date: 2015-05-28 12:02:33
What I'm looking at?
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:18:41
Does it have mobile version though?
Isn't it more like email, rather than IM?
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:20:11
here is a donut 
(you will need it)
@_date: 2014-10-01 09:04:32
That's not right, because they don't have profit margins with which they can cover the loses.
@_date: 2014-10-26 10:41:25
so, that's what you've been doing?
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:25:27
Thanks for the info! Few questions though.
- Is it accepted everywhere Visa is accepted (it was visa right?)
- is it really free to ship the card during beta as promised? 
- i guess it's to early to know if they waive the monthly fees?
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:17:43
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:54:45
It's not worth it to have bitcoin on a PC?
Ok this is a new one.....
You are kidding right?
And what about the non-iphone users? 
@_date: 2015-05-18 12:35:05
Because old, rich people have no idea how to buy them directly and would rather not learn. They will however gladly buy if it's in a way they are familiar with, in their comfort zone.
Also some people like the regulations and assurances of governments. 
We just got an option for those people. Until now it was mostly, younger, at least a little tech savy people. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:53:28

Ok if malware on the everyday account escalates to root, the other user will be encrypted so you are good until you decide to use it.
When you switch users the root malwave should be able to retrieve the pass when you are loggin in and you are owned at this point, right?
That's something I haven't thought of. 
But everything short of malware getting root should be ok? 
For example you have the malware but it's not root. You switch to the air-gapped user. That malwave shouldn't be able to do a thing, right?
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:58:01
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:25:27
How is it smaller then?
@_date: 2016-01-10 12:00:58


You serious? US government is one of the most oppressive, controlling ones with UK being his little brother. 
The only reason it's not represented like South Korea or China is because they own 95% of the world media. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:23:17
That is nice if it wasn't for their crazy fees.
Heck, they even charge 1% for POS transactions. That's unheard of.

Yes, it wont raise the direct demand of course, just the indirect one by adding ton of legitimacy and show people one of the many uses.

It is not that
@_date: 2015-05-23 16:13:50
Yes, but only 2 points of failure is still risky in my opinion.
For long term and significant amounts that is.
Since it's properly encrypted why not spread it around the cloud too?

I agree with you, sir.

yeah i can see that used like completely bullet proof method for high risk transactions.
Otherwise most people won't go through the extra hassle.

At this point I'm not sure if you are trolling or just very stupid :)
@_date: 2014-12-01 12:30:17
This inflation you mention is not independently measured for few reasons.
1. The goverment decides what gets into the consumer basket
2. The stuff in it is limited and often it's prices are goverment controlled directly or not (subsidies, protection laws and etc). It never represents the actual cost of living. Because nobody limits its consumption to just those goods. Not to mention services prices are not there at all
So, this is the official government manipulated inlation which is always much smaller than the real one.
You should be asking yourself how there could be so huge difference between the official inflation and the one measured to the outside world.
The dollars for sure didn't raise it's value with 30%. So, is the whole outside world going crazy or maybe just the government is playing it's games as usual?
You don't come of as dumb man, just a little brain washed maybe, so please think about that and let me know. 
The example you give about bitcoin. Yeah of course if you have bought on TOP of the bubble you will be on loss now. So is the case with every other asset.
You are just picking short term unfavourable time period. 
Again, look at someone taht invested in bitcoin logn term. For example he bought 2 years ago and planning to hold even longer.
Even now when the bitcoin is low he  has like 3000% profit. 
So, for some reason you are anti-bitcoin pro-Russian goverment which isn't a problem in itself but your arguments are kinda biased because of that.
I will be glad if you proof me wrong with constructive arguments though.

@_date: 2017-01-03 21:48:33
Thought the same. I think they can and having password protected your wallet.dat file won't help if someone gets the seed words. They will just generate the master private key from them and won't need the pass that encrypts wallet.dat
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:18:00
How does it work? Does it converts/sells the bitcoin in real time as the purchase happens or you "pre-sell" them to load the card?
How does switching the currencies work?
Oddly they don't say anything about this on their site.
The fees are good though.

That's definitely a great thing.
But completely not understanding something and writing a whole totally misinforming article comparing it to dropbox is plain and simple stupid. That's completely missing the point and acting competent about it at the sime time.
We all know that it won't be professional of you to agree with me of some people criticizing you being stupid, especially during the crowd funding period, but feel free to private message me  :)
I'm (mostly) joking about the stupid part, I don't want to offend (much) anyone, but doesn't hurt to critcize a bit the criticizer especially when there is a really good reason to do it.

Did you just use rasperrian and downloaded the blockchain from scratch or?
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:50:44
Yes bitcoind tends to crashes often with 512mb to 1gb ram. Swap takes care of that.
There are tutorials, takes 2 mins to make.
This battery outputs 1 Amp
i thought raspberry needs at least 2 amps to work stable? How is it doing so far?
@_date: 2015-04-24 11:32:13

Won't it make more sense Mastercard to be the actual client of BitPay since that's where the money go anyway.
Otherwise mastercard will have to trust OneBit to forward the money it already authorised for their customers to spend.
Would be easier and safer if money go direct from BitPay to Mastercard. Also Mastercard can afford to pay BitPay whatever because they will be making 2.9% in fees from the merchants that got paid that way.
?

@_date: 2015-04-11 13:14:22
How do you do that?
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:37:10
The only risk I see is since BitPay takes 24 hours to wire the actual USD. So, mastercard auths the charge now and get the funds 24 hours later.
Should be something they can handle though? :)

While clearly that kind of app is the future, replacing plastic cards, I believe mastercard dropped them. Meaning they didn't choose this start-up to continue.
So, not sure how they will pull it at this point but really hoping they do!

The best way would be that bitcoin wallet that uses NFC to fool mastercard paypass to think your phone is a card. (on the backend uses bitpay to convert bitcoin to fiat and forward that to mastercard)
Too bad it's not a reality yet, but I see this as the logical next step.
so, did you get laid anyway?

well mention just 1 then

The idea of Satoshi is that until the time the bitcoins are distributed the fees will be enough incentive for miners. If they aren't the economic incentive for miners is not enough, miners will quit, difficulty will fall, incentive for the rest will be better, they will make more money, other miners will join because of the better incentive, difficulty will raise, economic inventive for miners won't be enough, miners will quit, difficulty will fall, incentive for the rest will be better, they will make more money, other miners will join because of the better incentive, difficulty will raise, economic inventive for miners won't be enough, miners will quit, difficulty will fall, incentive for the rest will be better, they will make more money, other miners will join because of the better incentive, difficulty will raise, economic inventive for miners won't be enough, miners will quit, difficulty will fall, incentive for the rest will be better, they will make more money, other miners will join because of the better incentive, difficulty will raise, economic inventive for miners won't be enough, miners will quit, difficulty will fall, incentive for the rest will be better, they will make more money, other miners will join because of the better incentive, difficulty will raise, economic inventive for miners won't be enough,

If you don't see value in having unchangebale with back date, time stamped data, proving the existince of certain data at a certain time even after reading the whitepaper and lacking to funamentally understand it I'm afraid we can't help you.
Still can't understand why you would write an entire article about something you clearly have no clue about.....
This is not about decentralized dropbox, this is a system that can be used for anything from writing in deeds  of anything to setting history and facts in stone so they can't be changed ala Orwel 1984
Actually using that technology for history reasons is even mentioned here
Honestly I'm baffled that so many people even here are having hard time to understand innovations like this and the value of it. We are supposed to be the ones that get it right?  And we agree that currency is only the first use of this break through technology.
We have something that uses the technology for something different than currency and half the people are like yeah it's scam.
Same people said nothing about 99% of the alt coins that were really scam? 
I feel you for having to deal with so many stupid people and patiently explain them all and try to convince them in the obvious.

    What do you think of the product?
it's great
    What can we do to make it better? What are we doing poorly?
Personally I would like to know in which countries it's working
    What can we do to inspire trust?
Be around some time and don't get hacked

@_date: 2015-04-18 10:28:00
Well what if someone just uses other person neteller account instead of poker site?
@_date: 2015-09-11 10:31:44
well at least he will lose some weight
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:32:14
is that shift card thing out already?
@_date: 2015-04-30 18:38:08
yes, i'm aware.
But the link makes it harder to copy to clipboard. 
I was just wondering if more people have client setup or use web wallets and copy/paste the address as text.
@_date: 2015-04-06 13:28:18
So 2015 will be the year of wall street entering bitcoin after all?
@_date: 2015-09-12 10:33:32
This one is good too
@_date: 2015-09-14 09:30:07
Is not liking a fat fraudster who ruined the life of many and not giving a fuck about it while drinking an extra cream frappucino to keep himself fat, making me a racist ? Or what exactly is your fucked up logic here?
@_date: 2015-04-29 11:42:08
It's an option. Let the old school people use their means. We have ours.

Wait for him in an alley.....
@_date: 2015-09-14 09:31:24
Show me one other wallet that is as big as they are and not having any problems at all?
It's kinda expected the biggest wallet to be hit with issues first. And those issues are found there first. Which is good. In the longer term of course :)
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:08:52
What if someone that loaded his neteller account with bitcoins sent you funds to your neteller account? 
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:33:06

Did you add swap?
battery specs?
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:40:58
Not that I doubt you but is there a source confirming that?
@_date: 2015-04-30 18:09:29
ok it's done
But at this point I'm not sure if people prefer to just double click and copy or open a client? I mean how many actually use desktop clients? 
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:37:08
Nobody is asking you for money so what is your problem with people actually trying to do something?

Dude Coinffein was announced few months ago. What the fuck you want?
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:15:23
Does it ship to USA only?
@_date: 2015-04-24 11:30:21
I agree. We had problems with that too.
Basically we try to auto identify the return address and pre-set it but also give the option to the user to set his own. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:32:27
Please, please do that. I beg you!
If you need help, just ask the community I and many people like me are willing to help. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:22:16
I've been waiting for this!
@_date: 2015-04-03 10:05:51
so we have a new term here, blockchain encryption
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:15:32
all they do is sell your bitcoins when you peg them to an asset and then buy them back when you want to cash out.
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:38:17
You are childish!
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:17:29
So, you wrote the article? It starts with at least a couple untrue facts.

@_date: 2015-11-26 13:57:23
That is good, right?
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:55:14
It's a PR problem. If a lot of people lose money because of bitcoin based ponzi a lot of ignorant people will relate bitcoin with ponzi. You know how media reports.

Brace yourself for "Brace yourselves" kind of posts.

Actually he does. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 10:21:15
because e-coin is decentralized? :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 12:56:51
Excuse my ignorance, finance is not my primary field.
Since all those bitcoins backing up the shares are already bought. And new investors will only be bying shares for bitcoins already bought and hedl for 12 months how will this affect the price?
Unless the original accredited investors that are selling now choose to rebuy again fresh ones to hodl for another 12 months?
@_date: 2015-11-05 08:43:53
How come he can believe that if a government forbids something it's forsaken? History is full with examples showing the opposite. 
And let me just stick that quite at the end to make this post fancier.

That is clear, the question you can't even understand I'm asking is, how and where they hold the crypto currencies different from Ether?
How does it happen technically.
But I'm pretty sure you are not a technical person so you don't know. Since you can't even understand that someone would be asking that.

So if we follow the logic of this dinosaur we shouldn't trust anything that is NOT invented by a goverment.
So, don't trust electricity, don't trust phone. It's all being invented by some crazy guy that had no credibility at the time.
He talks for bitcoin as Satoshi Nakamoto is it's CEO and has control over it. 
Why they allow so ill informed people on the TV?
I feel like I want to slap this guy in the  face.

Our generation is the one that takes the power back to the people. We finally have the last piece of the puzzle.
@_date: 2015-03-12 20:47:12
You can make unlimited altcoins but they won't have the network effect, use and hence the value of bitcoin. But you can't make unlimited bitcoins within the existing blockchain.
Fiat US dollars are one system and they can make unlimited tokens within it.
Tre are other alt systems as well, other fiat currencies.
The thing is that with fiat you can make unlimited altfiats and unlimited tokens within each.
With bitcoins you can make unlimited altcoins but only limited tokens within them.
As with fiat currencies the alt coins that get the most real use will have the most value.
Hopefully that makes sense now :)
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:05:16

the buyer chooses the moderator so there will be different moderators for most transactions.
So, how do you do exit scam then?
Don't tell me that you convince them to be off the chain transaction because then it is not OB problem. 
Give me a way that it can be done on OB with their current design.
Tip awaiting! :)

business day is about to end in China, why they didn't move this price today?
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:28:47
Yeah. That's why I said 99%. It isn't perfect. 
But can be pretty good.
For problem 1 I agree competely it's tough on the new guys. But it's even harder to start and license your own company right? In any case you will have to put the work in, even work on a loss in the beginning as many start-up business do.
Problem 2, yes of course, there will always be % of unfair feedback. So, what?
Most people will buy from you regarless you have 100% or 98% positive feedback.

Great to have you here! Is there recent research on how well the new version works?
I've read your report on the original one and I'm curious to learn what has been changed/improved? 
I guess you were involved in the update?
Not sure if would be better to make another thread for just that. 
I'm sure many people will want to learn more about the options to keep their financial privacy, somewhat. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 12:25:49
well? :)
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:59:13
Ok, give me scenario how they get your encrypted bitcoin wallet stored in the cloud when they don't even know you have bitcoins or even storing something in the cloud?
Goverments have power but not magic.
@_date: 2015-03-21 13:15:44
Only difference is bitcoin has the technology to make even that doable, dollars don't.
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:47:51
and if you invested $100k during 2012 you will now have $60M
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:57:14
So the biggest news today without havnig actual news?
@_date: 2015-10-21 18:35:12
yeah I know about them. However, this is not helping here.
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:36:53
Which country is that?
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:16:35
you are thinking too small, how about mining watch? 1TH/s for a start
@_date: 2016-05-15 18:52:11
yeah neat idea actually :)
@_date: 2015-03-25 12:55:51
How does that work exactly?
What are the fees and conversion rates? How long it takes?
@_date: 2015-11-26 13:58:16
So they are finally seeing it? Good!
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:06:59
Because at 22 there is catch 22
@_date: 2015-03-12 15:37:56
I love how he says bitcoin is bad store of value because it can be replicated over and over again.
He only forgets to add that dollars can't be printed in unlimited quantities at the discretion of selected few.
@_date: 2016-05-10 09:05:58
Hey people should have the choice. You don't have to do it their way but there are people that prefer THAT way. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:03:25
I read the full article before asking. I asked because it was unclear to me even after reading it.  If you couldn't ellaborate further it would have been much better if you didn't post anything at all instead of posting NOT helpful shit.
@_date: 2015-10-21 13:55:00
Seems to be approaching for the lead pretty fast.
Is there any audit of the code? Any security issues so far?
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:20:20
"Davis was careful when it came to digital security"
And yet he kept his bitcoins in 3 web wallets/exchanges
kinda contradictory 
@_date: 2015-03-21 12:32:24
Yes definitely, but we are talking about ddos protection here.
This is a problem from completely other ball game.
@_date: 2015-03-04 12:39:14
He doesn't. They are trying to seize stuff even from HK.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:19:24
Ok this could explain the rally?
@_date: 2015-10-28 10:10:52
so deep bro. You should become a zen monk or something.

Would you spend a minute to check particularly the bitcoin fudning lifetime limit? 
I saw screenshot of someone here that said it's $650
His account was unverified so that might be the reason.
@_date: 2015-10-16 12:10:24
Looks cool, good luck with that guys!

@_date: 2015-10-16 12:19:28
Perfect sum up! 
As a somewhat of a joke I'll add one more point 
* A guy posted fractal analysis or whatever that predicts bitcoin hitting $40 000 soonish. Then fall back to $6000 and then the next cycle would hit $140 000 or so. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 09:53:58

Or one can get $35 raspberry Pi 2, 64gb memory card or thumb drive (~$20) and a raspberrian image with bitcoind setup and blockchain pre-downloaded (do we have one?) and be noding in 15 mins.
Actually if someone could set those up ready to plug0in, I'm sure most people woudn't mind paying up to $100 for the convenience.
But $150? Most people won't pay that.  
Still it's good they do that and we have that option. It's a nice start.

Great article. Really the fundamentals are better than ever. Everything is much better. Price is the same.
Sounds to me like price is bound to change any day now.
I like to believe that with having much better infrastructure now and not a single point of failure like during the last rally (mtgox) if another rally is to happen it will be stronger and won't be stopped for at least another few thousands $ per btc.
Thing is I'm feeling like this is about to happen any day for about few months now :)
But on the other side what are few months in the grand sheme of things?
It's definitely going to be interesting. One way or another.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:46:26
Yeah, i don't really need it if I'm keeping track of just one.

Where is this guy now? I want his opinion. Any contacts?
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:31:13
What you do guys is great! That service is long needed, because now there is one argument less against bitcoin.
You can have option to chargeback now if you choose so.

can you run it in terminal on a VPS?
what are the prices for seeing so far?
@_date: 2015-10-07 12:06:42
Last halvening price raised from $12 to $14 immediately. Then nothing happened for couple of weeks. Everyone said because this was well known event it is already factored in. Then it jumped to $30, then $70. 
Just saying. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:10:06
Now that is a good advantage. Thanks.

@_date: 2015-10-15 19:12:44
Isn't that just using different words because otherwise they might have problem with US authorities? 
So how in practical terms this is bad for the IPO buyers?

So, that's the reason for the rally? :)
@_date: 2015-10-29 09:07:46
My guess is $10,000 within 2016
usually each next cycle is more violent than the previous and this time we don't have single point of failure as last time (mt gox)
And also the 2nd time people will be like "Wait, wasn't that dead already? If it isn't there might be something to it if it's still around"
But time will tell
RemindMe! 1 year 
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:17:26
yeah ok, ALMOST the lowest

It sucks a lot cause there is nothing one can do in such situation. 
Paying up is not an option obviously, being out of business isn't nice either.
I'm wondering if services like cloudflare could help at all with attacks that big.
Would someone knowledgabe about this let us know?
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:30:49
Let me put it that way.
Digital value is much easier and cheaper to secure and transport if you know what you are doing.
Companies spend fortunes on physical security, armored trucks and so on, but tiny fraction of that if anything on digital security. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:38:17

Compare that to the cash stolen since it's creation.
Bitcoin is digital cash, yes it will always be stolen. 
It's much more secure than physical cash but still it's not fool proof.

@_date: 2015-10-12 17:58:41
Yes but you are missing moderators have rating too and bad ones will quickly fade away.
There might be isolated scams here and there but nothing on a massive scale or exit scam the like.
If someone decides to put the time to build a rating and then use that to do a hit or few yes that could work. 
I don't think there is a system anywhere to prevent that. 
But still seems to be pretty good system OB, at least better than the current ones. (ebay and the like)
At least I think so.

Ok since you know so much, just answer me this one simple question, what backs fiat? 
Government and economy are not real answers. Give me something else.
And what exactly is tangible version of bond, fiat? Yeah all kinds of paper are tangible but so what? it's still paper backed by PROMISE. 
I don't trust promise, do you?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:39:31
Thanks for nothing. That is understood.
The question obviously how does it work? I guess you don't know either.
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:31:41
If it's fast and the fees are fair it might just be decent yeah
Don't have my hopes high though.

@_date: 2015-03-09 13:59:03
I suppose having plug-in for popular ecommerce platforms that gives that functionality to merchants and buyers in an easy way is already in the plans?
If you offer that you are instantly ahead of bitpay and coinbase in terms of functionallity. Could really explode your business I believe.
Ideal use for me would be. Easy to use WP plug-in, that lets the merchant control his private keys but without hosting full bitcoind node and that lets the customer to use escrow/charegbackable payment if he choses so.
Hope that feedback helps :)

to $1000 yes
but the rally from $10 to $100 was 3-4 months after the halving. 
this is 10 fold increase  shortly after the halving. Dictated not by speculators but real life economics.
Then everyone heard about bitcoin and the rally to $1000 followed later that year. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 12:12:50
I see, very helpful.
So, it's the same as any sepa suppporting exchange only like twice epensive in fees.
Bitstamp goes at 0.5% as far as I know.
Well at least there are choices.

Should have been more clear.
@_date: 2016-05-08 21:10:18
Yes but all the merchants you use have their prices in dollars and calculate in real time the BTC value. So your buying power varies greatly depending on the BTC rate. How you deal with that?

Will the Winklevis ETF be actually buying bitcoins proportional to the demand for the ETF shares or how it would work?
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:34:07
ah, i was wondering what was that next to my nick
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:13:08
Do they have any plans to decentralize at least a bit?
Like open sourcing the front end and letting people run their own ones and providing them API access to the DB to match buyers and sellers?
Would be kinda nice.
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:59:13
Very professional notice and exit.
If I have to speculate, considering that it will be continued by someone based in Antigua, I would suppose that the current and known team is under scrutiny from some goverment agency. Most probably USA one. 
The tone feels like they are under legal risk and afraid to continue. 
If someone knows where are the current co-founders and team members based we could speculate some more.
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:47:42
I see. Thanks for the clarification! 
So, once their ETF is finally live, we should expect reasonable increase in demand and hence price?
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:38:33

The ninjas after you bro?

I can't even read the article because of truck ad blocking half of it.
Can't be closed either.

reddit notes could have been an assed on top of bitcoin blokchain, counterparty much?

Please enlighten me what is the difference between this hedging and just selling your bitcoin at any exchange and keeping the money at the exchange in fiat ready to buy back when you need bitcoin again?
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:48:30
I find it hardly an advantage. Something else?
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:36:45
Seems nice. I think it's pretty much like localbitcoins right?
If that's the case what are the advantages compared to them?
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:33:30
ok, i kinda got it now
it seems to be good then :)
@_date: 2015-02-06 12:22:16
The difference being bitcoin is young and everything is being built as we speak.
Fiat monetary systems are old and proven unefficient and not working.
@_date: 2015-02-06 12:16:46
I don't think he means you should keep 100% in gold or bitcoin.
Either that or putting 100% in risky business would be stupid.
You just do both.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:38:38
Yes they are asking for anal DNA sample.
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:19:42
Not long ago I heard by a grown man the statement that the US dollar is safe because it's backed by the US economy.
Another grown man (and actually well educated) said that the US currency is the only safe store of value at the moment because they can print their own money.
WHAT THE FUCK?
The disinformation and non-thinking is at alarming level these days.
@_date: 2015-02-18 13:29:49
I love how the media was so eager to condemn it as the worst investment for 2014. Yeah if you buy on top of the bubble when everyone else buys of course it will be worst investment. Because you are the worst investor.
At the same time it's the best investment of fucking human history when you look at 5 or even 3 years span. The media somehow misses that. Of course.
Everyone that has been around for a while and genuinenely interested in bitcoin made a ton of money. Most people that were lead by greed, media hype and what the other people say lost ton of money.
And I speak for experience because I've been around since early 2012 and never looked at bitcoin as speculative investment or a way to make easy money. Actually when people were buying at $5-$10 the most brave dreams back then were that it will eventually go back to $30 after the block halving in 2012. Even that was often dismissed at bitcointalk :)
The people that holded then because they were not motivated by greed but by love for the technology, unbelivingly watched how price got past $30, $70, $130......and the ones that were not in for the profit actually made the biggest profit at the end.
Interesting times.
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:00:40
You are obviosly retarded and probably under 18.
I'll just leave you with the thought that debts are nothing more than PROMISE to repay + interest. 
Now you can fuck yourself and have a nice life. Don't bother answering. You totally ruined the conversation. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 13:15:48
You are welcome. I have to deal with stupid people all the time too. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:20:41
Ok, great news, where is my price bump? I need my fix :)
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:30:33
Yes, nobody denies that.
It's just a payment system. It doesn't need to be backed by intrinsic value a many people believe.
But it's funny how many people think fiat is backed by something and only bitcoin is not.
@_date: 2015-03-04 12:48:06
So basically ApplePay eliminated the need the carders to write the card info to plastics and can use an iPhone instead?
With the added inconvenience of phone call to the bank?
As long as they can obtain the full card info from inexperienced users they will be able to use it to their benefit.
They will be also be stealing bitcoins from inexperienced users I have no doubts about that.
Even the best technology can't protect people that don't use it well, so seems more like a problem of human nature than any technology to me.
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:24:58
u da man!
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:37:51
Ok the bonds are backed by fiat and but what is (in practical terms) backing the fiat?
Average joe doesn't have bonds but fiat.

Cool, please let us know how it goes

Cocaine for everybody! :)
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:42:22
um, it's a community driven site?
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:32:17
Again history in the making and we are on the front row, gentlemen. It's gonna be extremely exciting 2015. Mark my words.
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:22:52
You realize the whole article is ironic right?
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:43:36
Yeah good point. It's a usability thing I think.
Especially when you have to make it work on a site not designed for bitcoin microtipping.
Like where does one put his address and stuff like that.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:39:19
I understand but what about companies incorporated within EU (for example in UK)? Any luck with those opening accounts there?
@_date: 2016-07-26 08:47:19
8% per year, for real?
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:03:12
That's not even true.

Clueless users doesn't make bitcoin itself not secure. It's technology is way more secure than any bank. Which by the way get robbed, hacked and defrauded every day. It's just not news anymore. 
Is it easier to rob you of your 50$ cash or your 50$ that you cary in encrypted wallet on your phone, that you have to decrypt and send to the thief wallet?
Come on.
Ah not to mention you could carry even millions in bitcoin just in your head. How do you rob that?
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:38:32
Yeah my concern as well.
If we know the money base before the banks leveraged it 10x to 100x we could get very very rough idea what effect will this new cash have compared ot the old one.
Isn't it funny that this info is nowhere to be found? 
@_date: 2015-02-13 11:37:17
fuck it right in the pussy
@_date: 2015-02-20 14:05:40
yes, exactly
actually, they go agressively against everyone for everything
seems to be the only way they know how :)
Actually if they ONLY fine you, consider yourself lucky. They could also drone the shit out of you as well.
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:47:19
It's much easier to get subscribers to funny, entertaining sub-reddits than serious ones.
you are comparing apples to oranges.
Also please mail your opinion to paypal, microsoft, dell, and the VCs that poured 300M+ just during 2014 in this thing bitcoin that isn't going anywhere....
@_date: 2015-10-16 12:20:52
you kidding right? Just read it, it's quite the innovation.

Did he end up in jail?
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:35:01
Exactly! 
It's all based on social agreement that achieved enough adoption. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 12:32:38
Doesn't matter, you will be just fine in the matrix. Have a nice life.
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:33:25
yes about 5% of it's value is thanks to it's utility, the rest is because it's perceived and generally accepted as a store of value.
@_date: 2015-02-06 12:12:47
I agree, it's amazing statement. Finally they are starting to see. And once you open your eyes it's almost impossible to get back to the old way of living.
(damn I'm getting philosophical today, must be the coffee)
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:03:53
Isn't technical analysist just glorified gambling?
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:17:34
Lol, so we went to the bottom of it and that fiat is backed by debt. 
That was my whole point from the beginning. Not sure why you were arguing  though? 
Debt is obviosly not backing. But quite the opposite of it. 
Your second point about not breaking a promise for 100 years as something that should be argument  I won't even comment.
Just a small hint, see the dollar devaluation for those exact 100 years you are talking about. It's something like 98%
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:45:38
And will actually be true for the average viewer.
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:35:36
This doesn't sound good though.
@_date: 2015-02-02 12:26:27
where is my moon rocket now?
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:11:46
Ah now I got you, yeah that might come handy.
In this case I just closed the site. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:53:03
