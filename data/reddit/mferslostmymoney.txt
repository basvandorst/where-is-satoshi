That's not what it proved at all.  It only proved that BTC is still volatile.  What did the $1100 drop from $2900 to $1800 just a few weeks ago "prove"?

Buying something with the highest value could be seen as a negative because more downside risk.  And of course it has a couple of unique things about it, but so does BCH and most every other altcoin.   The point is that BTC is not that different from all the rest and some of the newer coins are technically much better than BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:15:14
How do you get started buying it?  You buy from an exchange or from someone on localbitcoins or similar.

No, actually many of them have been right.

You don't know that guy.  It doesn't matter if he did it or not.  The point is that some people do it and he could be one of those.   I know you are desperate to believe that no one can consistently profitably daytrade but deep down you know they do.
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:45:20


Which would be terrible to work for yourself, instead of doing your shitty job every day to make someone else profits.
But most people suck at trading, so I get your point.

What do you mean what is the password...what a goofy question.    And the pw is stored in your head or write it down somewhere in a place it's not going to be found or understood.  It's a lot better than printing a paper wallet and putting it in safe deposit box where the gov't can seize it whenever they want or someone else can steal it.
It's a good suggestion and no one even knows that you have Bitcoin, vs. a Trezor which you have for a reason and costs $100.

Of course it does.  Lower supply means higher prices.  It's basic economics.  Lower supply of coins leads to lower supply of coins to sell...but this is all super obvious.

They don't need to own 1 Bitcon when they can own 1 Ethererum or 1 Monero or 1 BitcoinCash and accomplish pretty much the exact same thing.
I know you don't want to accept it, but Bitcoin has less than 50% of the overall crypto currency market and had only about 1/3 of it a few weeks ago.  Even if people care about crypto (and the overall majority do not), owning some Bitcoin isn't necessarily something they want to do with other options out there.
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:08:26
But you forget that 99.9% of people don't give a fuck about Bitcoin and never will.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:50:52
That's what you (and others) said when the other exchanges started accepting BCH deposits.  Instead the price went from $200 to $350.

I don't see any trillion dollar market caps, so again, if it was possible, then someone would have done it.   
You are making some kind of point there, but not the one you said originally.   But I agree that marketcap is not 100% everything.

ETH is up 4000% this year and the guy lost money on it.  And alts as a whole are up something like 1000% this year..much more than BTC.
So OP is just a poor trader and he admits he made newbie mistakes.  It doesn't say anything bad about the altcoin market though.  If anything ,it says it's great for trading, because if you shorted those when he went long, then you would have done well.
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:07:49

It was never implied that they were 100% equally shady.  Bitfinex seems to be a close  though.
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:46:32
Only if BTC goes to $0.  If he cut his loss at 5%, then he could only lose about $15,000.

Yep I am trying to lose weight and realized that I'm a stone cold addict when it comes to junk food.  So trying to treat it as such and drop 15lbs somehow.
And I got in early with both ETH and XMR and sold them for a small profit, when I woudl be a millionaire if I held till now.  It is frustrating but oh well.

Ok maybe that was a bit strong and I changed my comment.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:56:29
Yes if you think BTC is going to go up in value, then makes more sense to buy a big chunk now and not trickle funds in slowly over time.

Ok the conversation above speaks for itself.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:30:02

Again, you know little to nothing about encryption and how to generate a secure password.

@_date: 2017-08-03 21:52:13
Yes I know your post wasn't just for me and is for everyone reading this and I agree with what you are saying and it is helpful.  I'm just old and already know what works and what doesn't for me.  Decades of trial and error (and taking advice).
I refuse to get a fitbit and count my steps.  I would rather try to hike regularly.  I will get older and to the fitbit stage eventually, but not yet.
Again, i know how to lose weight but I am a degenerate junk food addict and that is my problem and I need to deal with that addiction and the rest will fall into place.  I'm just 15lbs overweight so not a crisis just from that number, but I'm killing myself with my eating.

@_date: 2017-08-07 03:29:38
Yeah it is definitely not easy to do.  I have caught some bottoms of the dip, but very stressful for a few to several hours later until you are in the clear.   Then I cut my profit too early as it bounces further.

@_date: 2017-08-12 04:16:38
Just sell it and take a small loss if it drops 5% or 10% or whatever.  If not, you risk 80% loss like those who bought in early 2014.   But if you are ok with losing 80% of your money in the hopes that it comes all the way back and goes higher, then that's cool.  It's not for me though.

It is considered the best and it is also considered the worst.  It just depends on who you talk to.  But it was the first, which is why it has more market cap than any other coin right now.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:31:18
Nope , total cryptp market cap is about $134 billion so if your goofy idea coudl be done, it would have been done already. But it hasn't because it can't.

I never said it is currently worth more to the market  Follow the conversation.

You are absolutely correct. $10,000 is moon.

@_date: 2017-09-19 16:40:51
Yes removing the ability of 1.4 billion people to use Bitcoin is definitely good news for Bitcoin.  If you made it so 8 billion people couldn't use it, would really be great news.
Incredible logic there.

@_date: 2017-09-07 15:01:18
You are deluded.  There are multiple scenarios where BTC would go below $1000 and stay there.  It's not likely, but it's possible.
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:20:38


They aren't going to stop you.  They are going to arrest you for it and throw you in prison for a few years.   And nice how you minimize the challenge of using Bitcoin without access to the Internet. 
"You can't kill Bitcoin!!!  You can still use it without the Internet!"  Yes that is really practical and watch usage drop 99% and the the price drop to the double digits.
But Bitcoin will still exist in the world, so I guess that's all that matters to you.  My god, you Bitcoin cultists are just as delusional as fundamentalist Christians.

Dumb article.  They did crash the price of Bitcoin pretty well.  It came back after that, but doesn't erase the crash.
And Dimon didn't cause the price to drop.  His comments came out when China was already banning or leaks about it, which is why the price dropped.

No one is saying it's dead.  That's a very lame and cowardly straw man.

I have that, but I didn't think you could manually adjust the fee.  I used it 4 years ago and then just installed it again recently to easily sweep some private keys.  I'll have to dig into the menu system, more but I didn't see that option before.

@_date: 2017-10-16 18:13:40


I never suggested I was going to impose this on the Bitcoin economy.  I don't have magical powers to do so.
And there was no "collective decision" made about fees.  They are what they are as a result of power struggles and free market dynamics.  However part of a totally free market is that someone can put a gun to your head and demand your money.  Or they can use other unethical actions that benefit them and not the other 99.99% of the people in the Bitcoin economy.
I didn't say anything about how to "solve" it or that it's "wrong" or "right" or similar.  I said it's an absurd joke compared to the way it used to be and how Bitcoin was designed to eventually work.  People are gaming the system and I don't blame them, but to pretend that isn't happening is naive or disingenuous.  And the result is that Bitcoin can't be used effectively for retail transactions or to buy most anything else in a practical way.

It's kind of tough to spend it when you pay 20% fee to send a relatively modest amount.


So true and I've seen it change over the years from fear of regulation to cheers for more regulation because it might cause the price to increase.

They don't fear Bitcoin.  They have the power to squash it and prevent most everyone from using it and they are well aware of this.   
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:58:32
I know people hate articles like this, but the guy is saying that Bitcoin will die because of gov't regulation, not because of anything else.
That is tough to argue with, at least for me.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:48:29
I suppose that is good advice.  Do you know which wallets allow that?

@_date: 2017-09-08 18:28:09
Either you are Chinese gov't official or posting nonsense on here.  I would suspect the latter is more likely.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:55:00
It would probably take months or years for a fork to "route around this" and of course China can just block that new route as well.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:44:14


They don't have to try to kill it.  They are trying to severely decrease it's use.   And they already succeeded in China and could do more if they wanted.


That is a nonsensical statement.


@_date: 2017-10-13 02:48:10
He didn't say Bitcoin would be "stopped".  He said the price would collapse, due to regulation.  It will exist, but the gov't will have stopped many people from using it.  They already have.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:55:24


It will be too late.  It should have already been done.  You can see how difficult it is to gain consensus to increase the blocksize or anything else.
And yes, of course some gov'ts will ban all crypto coins.  
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:04:06
The question was absurd and just being honest about that.  But yes I was probably kind of rude and could have been a kid asking it.  But still the question made no sense whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:59:23
What a dumb thing to say that Bitcoin is impossible to ban. 
When you make it illegal to buy good with Bitcoin and also make it illegal to buy and sell BTC itself, then Bitcoin is banned.   No one is suggesting they can erase it from the face of the earth, genius.
Is cocaine banned in the USA?   Yes.  Do people still buy and sell it on the black market?  Yes.  Do people go to prison and rot for 10 years for buying and selling it on the black market?  Yes.

It doesn't look like that at all.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:37:27
I got that part and it's still a drawback that BTC is not used for recurring payments.  Even porno companies won't accept it because of that.  It's a negative, not a positive.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:58:44
He is smart to try to enter a less risky long position.  And he will probably get his chance eventually to buy at around $3000 or lower.
We had the same threads like this in late $2013 when price was $900 and of course the patient ones bought for about $200 several months later.
Of course "This time it's different" like it always is to you guys, but usually it is not.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:09:47


Ummmmm...that's why people are scared it's going drop a lot more.  If it was $4500 a month ago, then would not be so much risk in holding right now.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:01:23

@_date: 2017-09-11 05:29:29

@_date: 2017-10-16 16:09:57


I didn't say anything about fraction of a penny.  I was talking about fees that make it reasonable to spend BTC.  I "expected" fees less than 15% of the transaction.   You can even send $2.00 of BTC from some apps because the fee is more than that.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:50:32
Bitcoin doesn't stop it.  It doesn't allow that and also doesn't allow much, much more.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:57:11


That isn't a feature, it's a bug.  Or at least it's a clear drawback in some cases and not a positive.  He even points out that hopefully smart contracts will fix this in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:58:15
He doesn't need the support.  He says he has gone 100% bitcoin years ago and has been paid in BTC for most all of his work.  Therefore he is filthy rich at this point.  
So he doesn't need the support, but he still deserves some money for his work if you are enjoying it.   
He probably also has made Bitcoin holders wealthier by spreading the Good Word so often and so far.  So that is another plus.  I will donate to him, because I've enjoyed some of his content and was somewhat educational, although I wasn't a noob when I started listening to him.  Roger Ver was the main dude when I got started.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:13:57

@_date: 2017-09-07 06:04:11
Having that first attitude would have allowed you to buy near $4000 instead of $5000.  What madness.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:02:23
Ok, I don't believe it and he is just being smart so he doesn't get kidnapped because he's super wealthy from all his BTC.  He went "all in" with BTC years ago.  Simple math shows that unless he was broke years ago, he is loaded now.
So I think he is "exaggerating" here, but I don't have any issue with that, because he doesn't need to be hiring 24/7 security if it isn't necessary.
And again, he's an awesome dude and deserves to be super wealthy and I suspect he is.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:51:44
In the real world.  I sent $12.00 of BTC with CoPay app and used "Super Economic Fee" and was still something like 14%, I think.  I don't remember but to use a fee that was supposed to confirm faster, it was 25+%.
And we are talking about spending Bitcoin and most people don't make $200 purchases often.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:00:22

It used to be a lot of things.  It was first a tiny group of enthusiasts, then it was a small group, then it was a medium sized group, then a large group and then adoption starting taking off and wasn't just enthusiasts and fees were still very low and not they are not.

That is part of it.  Even that would be devastating, considering all the public keys that are out there with funds in them.   If you check an address online, that pulls up the public address and then it is exposed.
And in theory, perhaps better encryption could be forked to the BTC protocol, but you know that's not going to happen until it's too late.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:41:43

@_date: 2017-05-24 14:36:39
If you are buying on the dips and making profits on the way back up, then also makes sense to make profits on the way down to the dip.  But of course not as easy in a bull market.

Biggest threat is gov't regulation.  Blocking Bitcoin nodes from access to the internet and also making laws where if you own or transfer Bitcoin, you go to prison.
Also when quantum computers are developed more, they will be able to crack BTC private keys.  That would bring the entire house of cards crashing down very quickly.
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:16:39
Yes good point, because BTC price is guaranteed to go up forever, especially with it losing crypto market share every day at this point.  It's already below 50% and still dropping.

Because they are dumb.  They have low IQ levels, generally speaking.
They also say that if they price of BTC dropped to $1, then they haven't lost anything because they haven't sold.  They are just dummies.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:01:10
Yes I was there too and "despair" is a good word for those trips below $200.

$3000 a month for rent/mortgage??  Some of us are able to live without spending nearly that much.
And some of us don't have a car payment forever either.   So yes my original point remains that of course some people can't retire on $10 million or $100 million because of their lavish lifestyle, but doesn't apply to everyone else..
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:44:04
That's because they didn't lose lose 30% of their money then.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:37:41
I had 100 that I was going to hold "long-term" back in 2013, but then I lose so much money on them in 2014 that finally bailed and sold them for a big loss (from their high).
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:44:38
Makes a lot of sense.  Go for it.   According to my spreadsheet, you would not do well but perhaps my math is off.  :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:30:28


Holders and DCA types aren't great at math and they don't really care about average return.  They don't understand it.  All they care about is getting more Bitcoin and holding it.  However much money they end up in the end really doesn't matter to them.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:38:59
I had $5000 worth of ETH when the price was something like $0.88.  Then it dropped and was down to $3500 worth and I took the loss.  Of course now it would be worth something like $500K.  And that was only about 18 months ago.  And similar story with XMR but would be worth even more.   Oh well..
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:12:40
Yes at least you realize you (maybe) aren't smart enough to be a great trader.  I'm not smart enough to be a great one either, yet I also I admire those who are.  
Many people here will say that great traders don't exist, because somehow it hurts their ego too much to acknowledge that reality. But at least you are smart and brave enough to face the truth and I try to do the same as well.  I wish I was smarter and a better trader and I would have much more USD and BTC than I do right now.

Pretty much everyone in the USA has access to the Internet and if they aren't "educated" in the way you are talking about, it's because they are stupid.  It's because they have a low IQ and do not read the news or gain any new knowledge in anything besides perhaps music and entertainment.  
It's not about education. It's about how well their brain works, which is shown by IQ level
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:05:23
"Sexist" to you is saying that women have two breasts and men don't.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:33:59


No but don't have to wait 20 years for people to be saying today how they put 5 BTC worth into BTC and not into "shitcoins" like ETH or XMR last year and then sold their BTC at $2700 and were so happy.  When they could have had 20x that.  (And incidentally I'm one of those people lamenting that).
And I am not anti BTC but also not anti non-BTC crypto either.
In case you haven't noticed, BTC is losing market cap % to the altcoins.  BTC is losing to the altcons when it comes to return on your investment.  
And yes, there are like 20 merchants on the planet that take Bitcoin when maybe 5 take Ethereum.  So congrats on that huge victory.
Anyway I love BTC and it changed my life, but some of you are disconnected from reality a bit.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:12:58
Women suck at math and they suck at Bitcoin.  It's just genetic, for the most part.  
And speaking generally and not about 100% of the women on the planet (for those simpletons out there who easily misunderstand).
And men suck at many things that women excel at...this should be obvious too.  But math and bitcoin and chess etc are not in that category.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:58:56
I had the same thought.  People are giving the guy tons of "press" and attention, which is what he wants.
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:25:40
It's not about education, it's about IQ.  It's about having a brain capable of critical thinking.  I didn't learn anything in college that made me especially more intelligent.

I wasn't talking about you specifically.  I don't care if you switch to Ethereum or not.  I was speaking generally and enough people are not leaving BTC right now to hurt the miners enough.  Maybe they will "someday" but not in the forseeable future.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:57:15
Not quite.  BTC still lost a huge amount of its market share and it's not getting it back.

Amazing that you have to explain this basic, obvious fact to people.  Better they just hold forever.  They can't understand the very basic facts of money management.

No the key (I think) is to trade without being emotional.  Cold and calculating.  I occasionally find that groove and realize it's the way to go, but I can't maintain it.
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:38:24


The reason no one has done it is because no one can.   Coinmarketcap or the other sites would not list it with just one trade and no one else caring about it.

Anyone who held from $3000 to $1800 is dumb and I"m including myself in there.

Like women don't rate men, etc etc. etc.
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:09:30
There is some lesson there, but if you would have tried the same thing with XRP a week before, you would have made 1000% return and would have 10x the amount of BTC that you do right now.
So what you did was not necessarily wrong or dumb, but your timing was just off. 
And I say that as a trader who does really dumb things all the time, including today.  I won't go into it, but it's definitely tricky and mentally challenging.  But holding is for the weak and for those who don't want to have much control over their destiny.  Of course you can flip a coin and decide whether to hold or not and if what you hold goes up forever, then you are set.  But if not, it can get ugly really fast.

No you don't.  If you could do that, then someone would have done that and they haven't.  Because they can't and you can't.

You can stay most people are stupid and I might agree, but I would also agree that all people are stupid.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:54:40
It sounds like you are in the reseller business, not in the BTC mining business.
Of course you if you are able to buy the mining hardware and use it for weeks and sell it for a profit, then you will do well.  If I could buy a car for $1 and use it for weeks and sell it for $1000, then I would be turning a profit too.
But most people can't buy the mining hardware for that much under market price.  If they could, them more would do it and supply would push the selling price down to where the profits would not be significant.

That's 2 better than 0 but still a joke.

So your definition of success is evil governments trying to co-op crypto for themselves?
You know they are going to regulate and abuse and pervert everything about it.

Your empty threats are a a joke. You aren't doing shit.  You aren't going anywhere.

No "bitcoiners" aren't ignoring "FUD" (which you most likely define as any bad news, true or otherwise)

That is not great advice, because Bitcoin fungibility is one of its greatest strengths and lack of fungibility would be one of it's biggest weaknesses.

I was lazy about getting my funds off Gox and lost several $K.  I was lazy about finding an alternative to Bitfinex and lost $10K+.  You are right.  Don't be lazy.

People are stupid and most should not be buying BTC.  The only way they can buy stocks and not lose a fortune is with index funds or else getting lucky.

Poor analogies that reek of desperation.  People have been saying this since 2013 and still virtually no one uses BTC for anything but speculation and store of value.  You can fantasize all you want, but not going to change reality.
