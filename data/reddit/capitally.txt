Could you have chosen a better typeface? That looks like helvetica or ariel and the B in Bitcoin is unique.
It might also make sense to use a light font because it's a small part of the B which is bolded.

It seems like every instance of money being stolen was because they didn't have 2FA on.

They're too diluted with greed to think the price will go anywhere but up. They don't want help, they think they know it all. I try to explain but they just yell at me because "nothing like this has ever existed before"

Yes I had this experience today. You need to click on the button in the bottom left that says "Code not working?" and then choose the SMS option. It will send from there.

The purpose of an escrow is an unbiased party, specifically when they can't agree. The best system for escrow is the current one. You'd need to send the BTC to the escrow service who would release it to the other party. What's stopping an escrow service from stealing your cash? Paying in BTC shouldn't change that.
The two parties in most cases won't agree so that's the job of the escrow agent. Who are paid to provide the unbiased service.
They would need to be reputable, just like a fiat escrow service. Plus most of the time it's not cash for cash. Current escrow doesn't require the party reviewing funds to put up cash anyways.

Awesome. I only use Coinbase so it would be valuable to me with their exchange

What you're saying is why Bitcoin is disruptive. But Bitcoin is not disrupting the Human Genome. In fact, Bitcoin was designed to have a limited supply. Supply &amp; Demand fit perfectly into existing human behavior that the less supply there is the more demand there will be.
Yes Bitcoin is disruptive, but it's not changing human behaviour.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:47:58
You're forgetting the most critical element is that humans control the price. Emotions drive trends in the market. And humans are predictable and never change. What you're trading is irrelevant.

That's absolutely **not** the definition of a Bubble. A bubble is fueled by speculation, not credit.
"A stock market bubble is a type of economic bubble taking place in stock markets when market participants drive stock prices above their value in relation to some system of stock valuation."
* A Bubble
* Bit Coin
* 2001 Nasdaq Bubble
* Housing Bubble
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:04:10
Speculation doesn't require funds. The media posting about the housing market could affect it's speculative value. Purchasing Bitcoins is driving up the value. People who purchase are speculating that Bitcoins are going to be worth more than they purchased them for. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:58:02
When you "cash out" is Coinbase actually buying your BTC?
Whats the difference between cashing out and selling your BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:01:12
Very interesting... How do you think coins will be labeled in that circumstance? Like "Coffee, B10^-19" ?

I literally laughed out loud! Soo true!
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:22:00
We're expecting a drop very soon, I would have waited until the value declines to maximize profit. However, BTC should be around $10k/each in 2017, so not as large a profit but still good.
