Of course I wouldn't be ok with it but the network needs to be designed in a way that it doesn't matter, or it will happen.

If there are 1,000 transactions in a block (above average) that's 0.1btc if they all pay an above average transaction fee. It's absolutely nothing and paying somebody to manage the settings for these transactions would cost more than you make. You don't need to be a miner in order to do basic arithmetic. 
So if you mine a block with an above average number of transactions (double, actually) and above average transaction costs, you've made less than $25. Being generous and tripling the transaction average still doesn't make it worth it unless hash power plummets.
