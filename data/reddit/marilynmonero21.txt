Yes, I'm very skeptical about the stable coin because it's introducing trust, unless the auditing company is also decentralized. 
We need a decentralized stable coin auditing block chain to go with it

A bail-in is the rescue of a financial institution that is on the brink of failure whereby creditors and depositors take a loss on their holdings. A bail-in is the opposite of a bailout, which involves the rescue of a financial institution by external parties, typically governments that use taxpayers money.

I guess it makes sense. What doesn’t make sense in light of this, is why did these banks ask for bail out, if they had insurance ?

Someone told me the most secure computer is in the box and has never been turned on. So yeah nothing is bullet proof but adding these layers might help. One of the biggest issue our community members have is being unaware of most of these. I just want to make sure my folks secure their assets ”at least this much” if that makes sense... 
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:11:10
I think they are true. But I tell you this
I have a friend I know personally. IRS Came after him and he had a 7 ( yes that’s seven) year’s court battle with them. He won. He actually 
WON against IRS BUT His marriage fell apart, they intimidated his wife and pretty much destroyed his life. 
I think finding a loophole and being right will not prevent IRS coming after you.
However if you fancy ending up in a case like that after years of stress just so you can prove you are in fact right , please go for it!
I’ll rather just pay my taxes

Merge mining with RSK 
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:45:31
Very solid. What is most compelling in this solution is the keen attention to "weight/ overhead" at the end consumer level ... basically - it has to operate quickly on a mobile platform (cell) because their network model is emerging market / mobile.  It reminded me of early DOS when the command line coding was the only way to work and memory / storage were expensive.  Code had to be tight and elegant to work quickly.

Wish there was an actual law that penalized misinformation - Fudsters would be out of job. Peter never denied any of the shortcomings of the technology ,  but it’s important to recognize that it is a remarkable computer science breakthrough. Also the part when he said  that the banks are “REVOLUTIONIZING” the financial system through Fintech which is NOT Blockchain but AI &amp; Big Data ( HA-HA) - 92 BofA Blockchain patents the last time I checked

@_date: 2018-11-28 05:19:43
That’s fine. I’m pretty sure the resistance was the same when the first Credit cards appeared. Whether or not you are early adopters, early majority, late majority, or laggards, it’s beautiful that for the first time in history people have a CHOICE. In case Visa stops working or credit cards are frozen during the next recession ( like it almost happened in 2008) , we have a viable alternative to resume trade with!

Do you have any specific details about how much ?

The Phoenix bird is associated with the rising sun, illuminating the sky ( hence illuminati). Its also interesting that the legendary bird regenerates much like Bitcoin. How many times did Bitcoin die and regenerate? 
@_date: 2018-11-08 01:50:44
Ok, that is a red flag in my book. Don’t you have bills to pay? Doesn't make sense that a business doesn't make money.

If you don’t believe in Bitcoin why spend so much of your time on Bitcoin Reddit? You’re worse than Vitalik and Wells Fargo combined ��

How do you guys make money?
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:00:02
Volatility is 5% usually, especially within short time frames like 1 week. So you can get 95 cent on the dollar or 1.05 cents on the dollar, but when it comes to credit cards you will always get 95 cents on the dollar.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:57:39
Remember the 1988 cover story for The Economist that shows a picture of a Phoenix, with a coin that resembles Bitcoin? I'm sure you’ve seen it, but if you haven't — you can pull it up in Google. Well, Phoenix bird is the representation of Pluto, and turns out that those born between 1983-1995, have Pluto in Scorpio which is a representation of decay, collapse, institutional corruption,  and societal change. This generation was born for social transformation. The next 7 years will not be pretty — but I think the constant ups and downs in crypto have trained us for whatever comes next!

Thanks for sharing that, I will have to research it. Are you happier with their fees?
@_date: 2018-11-13 00:59:07
I agree! I think most companies are not only unaware of these opportunities and benefits, but unaware of Bitcoin altogether !
Not sure where you are based — but we have a massive community of users across the state, yet hardly any of the businesses are accepting Bitcoin. That needs to change so we are trying to raise awareness among local businesses 
Like you said if they have an international website that’s even better! 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:15:26
Is that Visa tho? Europe has way better options— however a lot of merchants don’t accept non Visa cards. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:59:24
Sounds good ‘ I’m sure it will only get better!
@_date: 2018-11-29 06:09:38
Yes free atm fees, 2 % cashback , no overseas fees! I think it’s a very attractive hybrid even for non crypto users. Thanks for sharing 
@_date: 2018-11-13 01:00:48
Even if they choose not to accept Bitcoin , we would like to know what is their concern because they are paying 5% on credit cards rain or shine
@_date: 2018-11-28 06:29:05

@_date: 2019-01-27 21:15:01
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:43:31
Lol yes sir. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:58:06
Did you know that you can immediately convert it into USD ( if you choose too ). You pay 5 % to credit card companies rain or shine; but you can now be your own payment processor as well for 0% commission and cash out for 1.25%  
Settlement is also faster. Credit cards typically take 2 days to settle, while Bitcoin settlement is 6 confirmation. Not to mention you attract new clients 
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:24:53
I think everyone gets that! Visa doesn’t need promotion. This is for fiat liquidity not for Bitcoin commerce ... but if I have to choose between waiting 3 days to cash out from Coinbase to my bank account, or waiting 0 days, I choose the latter. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:22:27

Slavery = public ignorance + legislative opportunism / corporatism. Capitalism is evil , but if you want to be a free person today, you absolutely can. You can build your own everything and not be subject to this “treadmill” system. People just choose to participate — so you can’t save the hoi polloi from their own ignorance.

Sadly it will — exceptions are early adopters, but by the time the hoi polloi will ”discover” Bitcoin and stop listening to the mainstream narrative, Wall Street will have it pumped and it is going to be way too expensive for average folks.
