I think yo can consider it in the future of trade.  It's an investment in a payment and savings system.  A bank also provides and charges for these services.  Also it is a sort of government investment.   It is common to invest in currency or bonds which essentially is investing into the country and its government.  Bitcoin is an investment into a different governing style regarding money.

Absolutely, and which is better is a different question, but the whole movement of these decentralized crypto currency came not from the idea of a ponzi scheme but rather to stop investing in the corrupt monetary system we have and invest in one that is open and honest to all. (and other things too,  easy to use, easy to move, etc)
There is definitely a lot of bad speculation going on with short term profits in mind, but underneath and the real value isn't in how much money it can make you, it is how much society can be better with a better and more honest financial system.
The internet bubble indeed had a lot of bad apples, but we still came out with a tool, a system of communicating that past generations could onky dream of (which of topic is one reason why net neutrality is so important)
In the same sense, yeah a lot of shitcoins will hurt a lot of people but overall if society comes out of this with a better financial system, that is a great thing to invest in for future generations.

As much as I believe in the potential that crypto has, I believe the big part will be in the transparency.  I am very conscious of the fact that the rich are the ones that will own the most crypto in the future.

Nope. That's not it. I know that I got the amount that I asked to send. .3 btc. But both coinbase added for fees and then so did the transaction

If people only buy to make a buck then it won't gain any value

Why was it restricted?

If you are in Canada you can't sell since they can't link to Canadian banks

But I think it's saying something different.  Essentially the 1% will have the majority and even though I might make a little money from crypto, the wealth gap won't be closed by any significant amount. Even if I adopted earlier, simply for the reason that their buying power VS mine are on different levels entirely.

Sounds like something ethereum would handle

Sounds about right but don't forget all those people who invested years ago believed in it but nobody could actually know or be sure.
