There is no such thing as 'naked' short selling.
They borrow from the exchange, because it is the exchange that is left to cover in case the bitcoin rises and the short seller defaults.

So she took a shot and missed. No big deal, the guy doesn't seem to mind much and the public got to hear more about bitcoin.
Problem is she really didnt seem to understand that bitcoin is as good as cash, and that walking around with half a billion in your pocket IS ridiculously dangerous.

If you are talking about an 'emergent' pattern, you can't say the network 'doesn't know' or 'isn't thinking'.
The pattern emerges from a network of people who are all having their own reasons for doing what they do. They do think, just not about the pattern that you think you are seeing. 
I am pretty sure that people link the value of bitcoin to it's future potential use, not today's. So you can't link today's use 1:1 to today's value, no matter what the pattern is. If you don't know what people expect, you cant disprove a better link there. Of course there may be a high correlation between the rise in today's use and the rise in the expected future use. But that correlation will break at some point.

**Every currency supply 'schedule' is the same, as long as it is fully predictable.**
Bitcoin's slowing down growth, a constant increase or even a currency hopping around like a frog, it is irrelevant.
People thinking that a fixed supply currency goes up forever in value just because the underlying economy grows are dreaming of a free lunch. 
Such currencies exchange rates react to unexpected changes in demand only. Never supply, because that is known.

It's not a drawback, it's a feature of bitcoin. :)
In bitcoin there won't be the fractional reserve banking's credit bubble inflating and deflating causing boom and bust. 
I think it is the 'credible lender of last resort' function of the central banks that has corrupted the system from the start. It is what stops people from using their common sense when depositing their wealth.
Especially when you see that even good willing central banks must allow for much more credit expansion than is healthy, simply out of regulatory competition. Either give in or lose a lot of economic activity in your country.

@_date: 2014-03-18 12:47:44
But that is exactly what I mean. Instead of smartening up about what your bank is actually holding, the risk got passed on to the central bank. This way it could turn into a much larger systemic risk, instead of an individual bankruptcy. 
Historically the move is understandable. But it has gotten to a point where we don't need it anymore. Bitcoin banking can be done fully transparent about liquidity/solvency.

My favorite:
Aug. 27, 2010: I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something.

MtGox trades GoxBitcoins against GoxDollars.

@_date: 2014-02-18 19:50:53
They wont default over losing 10-20%, there is no mechanism to force them. 
In that case they will drag it out long enough so confidence recovers enough for some people to keep funds at Gox. Then Gox will have enough to cover immediate withdrawals, not likely to be as high as 80-90%. 
So no problem then, it's like fractional reserve banking. They can continue to cash in on commissions and nobody will ever know if they have the btc or not.

Aug. 27, 2010: 
As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:
- boring grey in colour
- not a good conductor of electricity
- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either
- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property:
- can be transported over a communications channel
If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.
Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you’ve suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.

Bitcoin supply is predictable. 
The actual schedule is irrelevant, it can go up, down or hop like a frog, it will never make headlines and as such you should not expect it to have any price influence.
A growing underlying economy will be anticipated and met with an early price hike and substantial hoarding as soon as that becomes apparent. No such thing as a risk free slow price change up or down, that would be a free lunch for all.
This grade C economics of sticky wages and prices is just laughable. That comes from the vocabulary of a government that can suck value out of an economy by unexpected increases in the money supply. Really a totally different scenario.

Compare it to a 'shared cars' plan that has more subscribers than it has cars. Knowing that normally they won't all show up at the same time to use the car. Or a fitness club that has more members than capacity. That doesn't mean they don't all have a right to use the car or the fitness equipment at any time.
Under 'normal' circumstances there is a loss of economic value leaving the fixed part of the deposits unused. Just like there would be if the shared car plan had a parking lot full of unused cars or the fitness center had half its treadmills unused.
Bank runs aren't caused by liquidity shortages, just when solvency is in doubt. It is just that the liquidity shortage becomes apparent first and it fans the flames.
It is about 'normal' circumstances. In extreme situations the 'term mismatch' will be a problem. The fat tails of the market. Like you can't even get into the fitness center on the 2nd of January..

**Any supply schedule that is fully predictable becomes completely irrelevant to the market.**
Supply can increase, decrease or hop around like a frog. It doesn't matter. 
Governments may have been able to keep a certain level of inflation because that is what they look at when steering the money supply. So the money supply in Central Banks hands is fundamentally unpredictable. It requires knowing every economic variable in advance, which is impossible. Then it matters. When it is mathematically determined, like with bitcoin, it is completely irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:15:24
The bitcoin price on MtGox was overrated due to the imbalance between moving bitcoin and dollars to and from the site. 'MtGox dollars' were worth less due to the difficulties in withdrawing them. This made bitcoins looks worth more on mtgox in terms of 'MtGox dollars'. Don't forget, an exchange rate is a relative price.
Now the reverse has happened and bitcoin withdrawals are even harder than dollar withdrawals. So the price on mtgox has made a big swing from a surplus in dollars to a deficit.
This is entirely a MtGox problem, little to do with bitcoin itself.

As a central bank you are a 'credible lender of last resort' when you owe money denominated in the currency you yourself can create.
In Cyprus the European central bank chose not to cover the losses fully. Because now the problem is system wide and they recognize the need to put the risk back into the hands of the depositors and bank owners. 
And the Cyprian government doesn't have control over the euro so they are powerless.  If the deposits were denominated in Cypriot pounds, I am sure you agree things would have been solved differently.

from an insider:
I've been wracking my brain trying to make sense of everything.  What gets me is that Mark isn't an idiot.  If I assume that the Crisis Strategy Draft is truthy, a scenario like this is more plausible than what we've been fed:
- Gox was robbed of a massive amount of coins (800k+) at some prior point in time, possibly June 2011, and has been operating a fractional reserve since.
- Gox determined that it was better to continue operating the exchange, probably both for the sake of Bitcoin, and for their customers who would eventually be made whole from fees earned.
- Gox knew of transaction malleability and had been keeping that scapegoat in their back pocket to use in the event of a bank run.  
- Or, they didn't know but the losses from TM were actually recent and minor.  Or, they didn't know but the losses from TM occurred over a long period of time and they never noticed because they never reconciled the books, because they knew they wouldn't match anyway because they were already fractional.
- Fiat withdrawal problems led to an increased uptick of BTC withdrawals, outpacing BTC deposits and draining reserves to 0.  This may have been compounded by an actual problem with transaction malleability that accelerated the process.
- Gox spent its fiat reserves and customers' fiat reserves to buy up BTC in order to keep the ship afloat until they could launch their rebranded Gox.com and Bitpocket wallet, which they'd hoped would provide more runway in the form of additional BTC deposits.
- Gox doesn't make it happen in time and is forced to shut down, negative on fiat by millions and having lost all BTC.

Difficulty rises to make sure a block is found once every ten minutes on average. Once blocks contain many more transactions and calculating becomes more work, the difficulty compensator could come down. Especially once the block reward is much less than it is now, halving every four years.

You wonder how it is possible that with so many true believers, the bitcoin price is still quite low compared to where it would be if it all panned out as we think it will. Bitcoin's market cap is still in the range of a tiny country's money supply.
My idea is that the bitcoin community is still fairly small, nothing close to the population of a small country. And most of us couldn't possible invest more in bitcoin even if we wanted to. 
That means we will have to wait for larger investors to enter the game, like the big institutional investors. That might well happen in 2014, who knows..

But the difference is that in the normal banking system there is always a credible lender of last resort, should something go very wrong. The central bank that can make the currency out of thin air.
In bitcoin there is no such thing. So fractional reserve banking on a system wide scale is just not possible. It will lead to defaults and people will lose money.
Of course when the central bank picks up the bill with the printing press, it is every holder of the currency that pays. But you could see it as an insurance scheme. 
In bitcoin you need to be much more careful where you store your money. Nobody will save you when a MtGox gets hacked or BTC-e gets arrested.

When you define a deposit as money that has to be liquid at all times then ok, can't argue against that. But there is no point in that, we don't need a bank for either safeguarding or providing checking facilities anymore.
You're going to see traditional banking in bitcoin with banks lending money out of cash deposits and people accepting it knowingly against an interest. 
And those banks will be able to make a living out of it without endangering depositors by hiring people specialized in judging business plans, mortgage applications and what not. That is what they ought to be doing. (There are stockholders to cover losses too)
Money has a time value, even without taking on risk. There is a risk-free interest rate to be earned. 
Anyways, triple entry accounting should make it much more transparent how a bitcoin bank uses its funds. Might even provide an insight in the term mismatch and loan performances. I think that is where the focus will be next, after bitcoin the currency and bitcoin the payment system it's bitcoin the accountant. That could reorganize the economy.

There will still be the 'duration transformation' that banks do. Attract short capital (bitcoin cash) and lend it out for a longer duration. Can't go calling that a casino. It's is the traditional function of a bank, they make money on that given an normal interest rate term structure. (short term rates lower than longer term rates)
I could imagine accepting some of that from a bitcoin bank, against an interest or valuable services. 
Do you think in bitcoin there is a fundamental difference there?

The fact that bitcoin doesn't need a 'checking' system or a guarded vault will limit the need for depositing your cash balance with banks.
But there is such a thing as the 'time value of money'. There is a risk-free-rate of return that still needs to be earned. If you don't need to use your money, a bank could lend it out and you could earn an interest rate on your deposit. And that deposit may still be made instantly available to you.
That is a normal banking activity. But if a bank uses a fractional reserve, you want to make sure you know they do. And get an extra reward for running the risk of a bank-run.
I think this will not turn out to be a problem in the bitcoin world. The present banking system is more fucked up than you think. Outrageous fractional reserves will cause failures in the bitcoin world and people will want to know about it. 
**Unlike the present system where the government as the lender of last resort can bail out anytime, there is no credible lender of last resort in bitcoin, since nobody can make bitcoin out of thin air in case of an emergency.**

The no-intrinsic value argument. Someone please write these **Satoshi quotes** on their walls (then run before they come crumbling down):
Aug. 27, 2010:
"I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something."
Aug. 27, 2010:
"As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:
- boring grey in colour
- not a good conductor of electricity
- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either
- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose 
and one special, magical property:
- can be transported over a communications channel
If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.
Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you’ve suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it."

**This is not what is says. It says bitcoin 'cant rely on the public sector playing catcher behind the money creating  banking sector'.**
It acknowledges the risk of the banking sector's money creation, but says your money is safer because the government can always bail them out.
But the government playing catcher is EXACTLY what has caused all the problems. People have turned a blind eye to fractional reserve banking, because the government can always bail the banks out with the printing press  during a crisis.
In bitcoin there is NO credible lender of last resort. So system wide fractional reserve banking will be impossible. Not even the government can create bitcoin out of thin air. 
So no more credit bubbles causing boom and bust!

GOX doesnt need to be solvent to continue. 
Even if they lost 20% of the BTC value, all they need to do is convince enough traders to not withdraw more than 80%.
And that is perfectly possible if they can drag it out long enough to rebuild a bit of confidence. So expect the need for extra 'verification' and 'withdraw limits'.

The amount of coins is totally irrelevant to the price, AS LONG AS IT IS PREDICTABLE. A change in the rules will give a sudden price shock, and then nothing else..
There is no such thing as a predictable price decline over time just because there is a predictable supply increase. That would give a free lunch to anyone shorting the coin. Economics 101 really.
What dogecoin has shown is that it is not predictable, that they can change the rules at any time. That is what makes investing in this coin dodgy.

(see 
Several arguments against the success of Bitcoin are doing the round:
1. Bitcoin is a bubble, the present $1000+ price level bears no relation to the small bitcoin economy.
2. People are hoarding bitcoin and not using it. How can that possibly be a successful currency?
3. Bitcoin has a deflation problem. The general price level has to keep falling to accommodate the growing bitcoin economy, because of the fixed supply of bitcoin.
These arguments are false, and below I will show why. I will do this in terms that many students of economics are familiar with; the Quantity theory of money:
M · V = P · Q
or the Money supply times the Velocity of money equals the Price level times the Quantity of goods. This relationship holds by definition.
People could argue that when the money supply M is fixed and the economy Q grows, the price level P must drop to accommodate it, which would mean deflation.
But then you are falsely assuming V, the velocity of money, to be constant.
What happens when people expect a drop in price level P? They will postpone spending. You know your bitcoin will be worth more tomorrow, so there is a free profit to be had. This drop in spending now would mean there is less bitcoin chasing after goods today. People are hoarding bitcoin. Price levels in bitcoin will adjust, going down today. Saying that the price level in bitcoin goes down, is the same as saying the value of a bitcoin goes up.
This hoarding will continue until the price level expectation does not provide a free lunch anymore. In a bitcoin economy with its fixed money supply, it isn't the Price level adjusting to the growing economy. Instead it is the amount of bitcoin used in spending, or the Velocity of money.
So we can expect bitcoin to be hoarded at first. The bitcoin value should be expected to climb rapidly and then stabilize. 
What the Quantity theory of money shows us is:
1. The price of a bitcoin wil move now, up to a level fitting the size of the future bitcoin economy. Assuming bitcoin adoption, the $1000+ price is no bubble. The total value of bitcoin of about $15 billion is still very low compared to any reasonably sized economy. (
2. Bitcoin hoarding is normal. The velocity of bitcoin will speed up over time. Bitcoin hoarding is a logical consequence of the expected growth in the bitcoin economy, in combination with the limited supply of bitcoin.
3. There will be no constant deflation with bitcoin. The value of a bitcoin will jump to a level that fits the future bitcoin economy size and then stabilize. It is the number of bitcoin used in spending that will adjust to the growing bitcoin economy over time, not the price level.

@_date: 2013-12-01 00:22:13
Just because there is a fixed supply of bitcoin, that does not mean prices will have to keep going down. 
No price can consistently and predictably move more than 'the' risk free rate of return, simply because that would provide a risk free profit that the market would adjust for. Bitcoin worth more in the future? I buy now and keep buying until the expectation of a further price rise is gone. Lowering today's prices of goods in terms of bitcoin and raising future ones in the process. The coins I bought I will spend tomorrow.
The Fisher equation isn't bad in showing what is happening. MV=PQ, the supply of Money times its Velocity equals the Price times the Quantity of goods. We know M is fixed and Q is growing constantly. When we wrongly assume V to be a constant (as is often instructed) then the Price level would have to accommodate for the increase in quantity Q by going down. Deflation as some say.
But as I have shown, P can't move predictably without affecting people's decisions on postponing to spend. A predictable price drop tomorrow will cause less coins chasing after goods today (we are hoarding) and more coins thrown around tomorrow (we will spend). What happens is that today's Price level will lower and tomorrows Price level will go up, equalizing the price difference to within limits of the risk free rate where it can persist. 
This effect of hoarding is exactly what Velocity of money means to say. Because of the fixed supply of coins and the growing economy, we can expect Bitcoins to be hoarded. The velocity of bitcoin is lower now than it will be tomorrow. The price level on the other hand will be stable within bounds. (Not keeping into account other demand fluctuations)
The problem I have with the Fisher equation is that it seems to describe money using independent variables. As you can see P and V are linked, so you cannot determine the change in a one of these two variables when you know the change in the other. There will be second order effects. In this case, a change in P will lead to a change in V now, which in return will reduce the change in P...

At the moment mining is first of all a method of distributing bitcoins 'evenly'. So you should see that separately from the cryptographically locking up of transactions.
To just process the transactions, even 10k per second in a much larger block size, there is already enough computer power. The increased difficulty shows the surplus power available. So I don't think there is any reason to think fees will be higher, especially because the difficulty can drop after the block reward falls further.
Correct?
