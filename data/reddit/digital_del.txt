I'm not.  Bitcoin as we know it has a permanently lower market cap because of the hard fork.

Wow, what a conversation for the record books.  
Jgarzik proposes a block size increase and Satoshi essentially says not now, we can that later

You won't believe

because that's terribly misleading, and people react poorly to mislabeled and misleading concepts

Bitcoin cash underwent some specific technical changes to fork itself away from the other clients.  
It also kind of boils down to simple majority in this case.

it's probably waiting for your deposit to confirm enough number of times to become available

Ouch, sorry to hear about your loss

A thought experiment for you. 
Imagine I make a cryptocurrency that has 100 million units, then I keep all of them except 1, which I sell to someone for $1. 
My cryptocurrency now has a market cap of $100 million dollars.  Is it really worth that much?  No.  Tiny price movements can change the market cap value dramatically.

Sooo, was this Coinbase or blockchain.info's bug?

I had to double check, looks like they have 99.91% uptime in the past 90 days

This is their only official communication on it.

I think Coinbase is doing right by trying to give access to both chains.  Even if you're for one chain or the other, you get the chance to sell the forked coin for the one you want.

Say you have 1 BTC before the fork.
After the fork, the two chains are incompatible with each other, so while they share the same history they can be spent independently of one another. 
This means you now have 1 type of BTC and another type of BTC.  To avoid the crazy confusion, they can't be called the same thing.  Eventually it will be decided by the community about how to label them and which one really gets to be called "bitcoin" still. 
The two different coins you have do not have the same value.  There are futures markets going on right now that try to estimate what each new coin will be worth.  No one knows for certain right now, and the value can change very rapidly at the time of the fork or shortly after.  
It's also not guaranteed that both chains will necessarily survive (although it's certainly possible).  One chain might not have enough miner or user support to give it value and do the work necessary to transact in reasonable timeframes.  If a chain is not popular or usable, then demand will dry up and the price will tank.
If you really want to make your own decisions, just keep your bitcoin in an address that you control the private keys to (before the fork), and you will be guaranteed to have ownership in both possible chains in the event of the fork if/when it happens.  Then you can decide which to keep later.

With this type of fork, the entire transaction history of the chain is being preserved in each new chain. 
So if you own bitcoin at a particular address before the fork, it will still be recognized as being held on that address on both chains after the fork.  Spending the currency one one chain won't necessarily spend it on the other chain.

Wait, how is that possible, don't litecoin addresses have a different format and start with "L" instead of 1?

The flipside of this situation is that while there is a large amount of BTC shorted, all of that volume is committed to be bought back at some point. We're in for a wild ride.
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:05:47
oh god, I can see why exchanges don't want to support both at the same time, talk about a nightmare of lost coins
