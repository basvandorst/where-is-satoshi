Or you could think of the hashpower that you could buy with that wealth in the future.
Unless China can maintain a consistent monopoly on ASIC production for decades and subsidise ever-growing amounts of electricity it is irrelevant in the long-term.
If China were to censor transactions they would either be deselected, out-competed or destroy the value of their investment. We've seen this before with ghash reaching 50%. If they continue to subsidise mining without censoring transactions then they are performing a service for the network and being reimbursed for it as per the whitepaper.

Upvoted OP for the showerthought. There is surely some blood-pressure correlation as well. 
I suppose there could be supplemental hodl scores for previous addresses you could prove were yours. Security is a process and not a state. It's unlikely that many people were able to secure their coins in the best way imaginable straight away. 
Respect to those that got it right first time but don't let your hodl score prevent you from moving to multisig or some better arrangement than you currently have.

They are not relayed by miners, they are relayed by nodes. As a node operator I can choose how much I would like to subsidise Bitcoin to support the vision of its future that I believe in. Miners don't have more costs than a node operator with respect to a higher transaction throughput.

 * a. The one that shall not be named.
 * b. I don't mine so that's not an issue. I favour a fork that restores Bitcoin to Satoshi's original vision.
 * c. Because I wanted to know how many transactions were in the backlog and I could not trust the web views of certain nodes that were specifically compiled with incomplete views of the backlog. It does not matter that I compiled mine with a transaction limit way above the memory I have available right now. The client that shall not be named has transitioned Bitcoin to have a global mempool by nodes randomly dropping transactions in their mempool when their limits reach 50k transactions. If I didn't compile it with an insane transaction limit then the same effect would be had by the global mempool. 
Also, if I didn't someone else would and I wanted to make sure that Bitcoin could cope with someone running such a client. What I've actually seen in response to the global mempool is a very sad attempt to follow the anti-virus companies in their regular signature updates, ever more complicated policies and heuristics that convince me that the simpler approach of raising the MAXIMUM blocksize limit is the right way.
You could say that I believe BIP101 is inevitable, almost here and welcome. I'm just waiting for the rest of the Bitcoin world to realise this is the way forward (just like a few years ago I was waiting for the rest of the world to realise that Bitcoin was the way forward).

Physics for sure, information theory, the minimum cost of computation, the reason why some aspects of Bitcoin were chosen.

My overall point is that user coins are at risk by depositing with magnr.
@_date: 2015-06-12 03:04:04
Because no other miner would build on the block that the dishonest miner published because it contained an invalid transaction. It would be an orphan (as well as invalid) and the valid transactions in it will be included in other blocks. So the coinbase will never mature (100 blocks later) and the miner has wasted their time.
That's all assuming there were a bunch of dishonest nodes forwarding invalid blocks (honest nodes wouldn't) or that the block was able to be transferred between miners via stratum (don't know if it checks since it's designed for speed).

Check you can send from the location beforehand an your network is not blocking port 8333 or you have good 3g.
Perhaps you could send money to three people, who keep a little and send the bulk to three others and so on while you present everyone gets some.
Make sure you use a wallet that doesn't have to wait for a confirmation before being able to compose another transaction (most wallets are OK I think)
You could mention multisig and multisend, perhaps by an analogy to a cheque with multiple payee and amount boxes and n of m signatures.
I agree with others that especially for this demo you should use a simple wallet that has no sign up.
Good luck!

If there is a split all there needs to be is a shapeshift between them. The block chain will carry on recording transactions in both economies. People will have white or black wallets and shift between them as needed. People can buy their bitcoind from circle, shapeshift and buy their drugs.
Sure, there's hassle but it only takes a few market makers to open the channels. If NY is isolated it's not clear to me that their coins will be more valuable. They have additional scarcity but reduced utility. It will be hard to have enough of both to be more attractive than the (almost) global currency.

So rename the Bitcoin unit to mean a million satoshis instead. Or a thousand depending on when you need to do this. I'm not advising it but it would happen before the cap was raised.
Better to just advertise satoshis or bits and start with multiple units. This is what we do already, satoshis are the unit of account, 1 Bitcoin equalling 100 million of them is just a convention.

This doesn't destroy fungibility as the satoshi can still be used as a satoshi in a Bitcoin transaction, only economic incentives of the holder prevent it from being used as such. No claims of fungibility beyond that are claimed or required. All this can do is add value to satoshis, it cannot subtract it. The satoshis must have value already to be useful here.

like quadrupling the monetary base (US, last 6 years) to extract wealth from the rest of the world? Bitcoin already has protections against that, thanks. Perhaps it's time people learned some personal responsibility. It is voluntary after all.

Not at all. If you could prevent transactions being included in blocks, Bitcoin will fail. If an exchange chooses not to process certain coins, the market will decide if it is a smart move for the exchange in question.
There are OTC trades and the coins will be distributed to individuals that would then have no reason to beleive these funds are stolen. Is bitstamp prepared to piss off that many users in the next wave?
What evidence would a localbitcoin user buying $20 be expected to analyse? There could be coins from 100 heists in there. Either this is electronic cash or it isn't.

Ah yes, I remember now. Around November '13 when fincen started doing their thing. I'm not sure what his current views are either and I was certainly worried about the issue at the time. Now I'm not convinced it's possible to achieve the damage they want with to do to fungibility.
If there's a centralised list then what happens when the list goes down, do all payments stop? Will all exchanges keep an eye on that same list. Propagation speeds alone mean different companies have different views on the list. A slight glitch on a company's list parser and they're stuck with dud coins. Nobody will stand for it.
And how is this list updated? How do I prove I had a secret and lost it? I could make claims against any coins I'd just used to make a purchase. I could report them stolen then realised I moved them. How does this list reliably deal with all this? Who will run the servers? How much will it cost to run? How much will it cost to use?
There will always be leakage. Even if list adoption meets with limited success you now have green and red bitcoin, there only need to exist one zerocoin that can shapeshift between both and now all taint can be removed. The two economies can also exist side by side with cash, gold, hawala or even cigarettes acting as the bridge between the two.
So that's how I learned to stop worrying and enjoy watching those chasing coin invalidation fail.

Regarding MV=PQ (defined below), the economy can work if M is fixed (or increasing at a known rate). You then have PQ (Nominal GDP) is proportional to how fast money is flowing through your economy. That makes sense - if people are making and buying more widgets and beers, your nominal GDP is higher.
But what does Nominal GDP really mean? That products are being made and sold? What if those widgets are locks for a gated community that has become afraid of itself? Or an alcoholic nation working un-fulfilling jobs to buy enough drink to forget about their misery? Do many of these economic parts constitute a healthy "Gross Domestic Product"?
The GDP measure came with a whole raft of caveats and we are and have been breaking or bending most of them by things like QE and creating financial instruments that appear to increase the MV by any means in order to rank highly on a world scoreboard. A scoreboard which has no consideration for the way people feel or treat each other and no relevance for over 99% of people on this planet.


Correct, prices are going up. The dollar has lost 95% of its purchasing power over the last 100 years. Prices won't go down if you keep printing money.


I want to tackle this, I really do, but I need to pop out.
Your link states "Friedman's k-percent rule is the monetarist **proposal** that the money supply should be increased" so it's not a rule, any more than Moore's Law is a law. I like Friedman, especially when he points out that the system he is working in to be imperfect and imagines the possibilities of being able to free ourselves from it.
M= money supply, V= the velocity of money, P=prices, Q=quantity of production or activity. PQ = nominal GDP

Falsifying the time-stamp would have to be done in a coordinated fashion, with some luck, to achieve a minor manipulation of difficulty adjustment to produce very small gains that would average out over a few difficulty changes.

Once an address is spent from, the public key is recorded on the blockchain. If the address only has only ever received coins then only the address (the hash of the public key) is stored in the blockchain.
The public key being exposed once might offer a route to the private key only if ECDSA was found to be fundamentally flawed. Multiple signatures by the same private key increases the risk that more minor flaws in ECDSA or its implementations would reveal the private key or reduce the  keyspace that needs to be searched.
I think there was an example of a wallet that didn't increment k, leaving users private keys vulnerable to the same implementation error that caused Sony to lose their playstation keys.

Third, is the impact on monetary and financial sovereignty. Modern day currencies come from monetarily sovereign nations. If your pocket is filled with USD, what you really have is a representation of the US Government’s, or the US Federal Reserve’s obligation to you. Even if only USD were circulating around the world, other countries would still limit its use. The growth of this type of USD power has heralded the development monetary functions designed for the world of Internet finance; for instance, Bitcoin. In the past, Bitcoin has experienced a downturn but is slowly recovering because this Internet money [Bitcoin] has found living space and necessity to feed off of. If somehow the future Internet only accepted RMB, this would not be feasible nor wanted. Another example of Internet finance is this, on the Internet you can provide financial services to people in an entirely different location on Earth. In the future, the concept of monetary or financial sovereignty will be broken through: Bitcoin has a lot of space to exist. Bitcoin is a sort of money, and though it is not currently accepted as legal tender, any government could accept Bitcoin then limit its use. Because we are a sovereign state, the economic sovereignty of the country is largely dependent on the monetary sovereignty. In the future, in the Internet generation, every country will slowly relax sovereign control and even dilute the concept of sovereignty.

A good Python dev contractor in London is £450 per day so i can see that's ballpark. Trouble is that's for custom software. I think people were thinking it would be a stylesheet on a regular out-of-the-box forum package rather than attempting to redefine the forum software space.
As for the code, I've not dived into it to determine quality but it is much less than I would do for that amount. Personally I would have tried to do this through volutary contributions and one guy pulling commits in and filling the gaps. But that's not what was advertised by theymos. It was advertised as build forum software so I guess he's doing what was asked.

1.) Smart contracts.
Transferring a private key is not making the transaction. It would have to fall under the same regulations as though the attorney was speaking a secret to the third party or passing on a locker key I'd guess. I've no idea what that means in terms of attorney-client privilege. Since there would be no blockchain transaction involved there may be nothing to report.
2.) Ethereum and DACs (digital autonomous corporations) 
Once someone creates a DAC for something it will obey whatever rules the creator specified. There's nothing that can be done to stop it. Other implementations can come along (more fair, more open or more profits) and people can choose whether to move their investment in exiting DACs there.
There is nobody NYS can go after as nobody owns the DAC. They can try and trace all the Bitcoin investments but then the investors might not be able to change the objective of the DAC. The worst they could do if they find people is scare them into cashing out but this would (in a good DAC) only slow it down until enough people re-invest after mixing their coins.
The code and the ideas are out there, there's no putting it back in the bottle. DACs will be built, mostly by anonymous creators. They will be launched, and nobody will be in control. They will operate without a country of origin, articles of association or bank accounts. Anyone will be able to do this, and simply. It does not require Ethereum (the company) to do any more than it already has (though the more progress they can make, the better).
3.) Sidechain Altcoins, Testnets
I'm sure they would want to track both the sidecoin tranasctions and the interactions with Bitcoin.
Since testnets reset frequently and often operate at an accelerated pace I doubt they count as currency any more than plastic toy money - they can't hold value and they have no market. They are free (valueless) by design, otherwise they cannot operate as a testnet as people would not be able to obtain them. 
Having said that, I see no reason a DAC couldn't use a testnet as an accounting system, transferring state between resets. There could already be a steganographic communication system happening right now on one testnet or another, operating for free.
4.) Digital Ecosystem
No reason for a DAC to use a web wallet. Bitpay could only know it came from the DAC, so it would be forced to reject it. You'd have to go full-bitcoin to offer your services to a DAC that maintains privacy.
5.) Voting
I would imagine a voting system would entail an address that you own that you declare/register as your voting address. It need not have any funds in it, you just need to sign a message using the private key of that address (no booth required) and to send that message somewhere to be verified and counted.
Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.

The cost for the mission would be roughly static so you would just have to wait for a large/rich enough asteroid to float by to make it economical.
To give you an idea of the cost, there was a an analysis done whereby we could have had NASA do eight major space programs including capturing an asteroid, moon base and Mars base for less than the cost of the Afgan/Iraq war.

Namecoin's value is small right now because it is waiting for the disintermediation of ICANN. It's value in protecting bitcoin sites from the threat of domain name seizures. It is still doing its job, like mutually assured destruction. It wouldn't work better with the bitcoin blockchain as it would bloat and overcomplicate it.
Bitmessage has no currency because it needs no blockchain, only the mempool.

GentleAlarm in the Play Store has this feature. It fades in quietly a set time before the actual alarm in case you're in light sleep since you feel better if woken that way earlier rather than from a deeper sleep later. Allegedly.
It also has a feature that asks you maths questions of the form (a*b) + (c*d) and you need two correct on the run to switch the alarm off. So either your tardiness or mental arithmetic improves.
As for your idea, I'm imagining it going this way as well. How do you see it working? The way that gels with the way I've wanted to see voting work is something like you get 100 satoshis per month and you can weight your vote for certain issues. I see some people using one per issue on 100 issues, some throwing them all at a single issue and everywhere in between. Unless that breaks democracy somehow, I'm no expert.

Didn't know what Bitcoin was but then he came to know
The implications for his portfolio
Some AnCap was layin' down some hashes 'lotta coin, 
he said
Then the dollar did seem to fade
Came back to gold on a wave of trade
That weren't no B.S. that was groovy crypto coin
There's a old white man crying all the time
He'd like to come and kill it
But he needs to warp our minds
There's a old white man crying all the time
He's told us not to buy it
Cause he fears that it will shine
He told me:
Let the miners lose it
Let the good firms use it
Let all the cronies boogie
I had to post somewhere so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out you heard the bullshit too!
Switch off the TV 
we may even see him on channel two
Look right at him I can see his fright
If we change nothing but push capital flight

You can't change the details of the transaction without the private key.
Edit: having now read the scorched earth link I certainly won't be using a wallet that signs two transactions or uses anyonecanpay indiscriminately. If it's lunch the seller can take the risk, like they do from tab walk-offs now. If it's anything more expensive it can be bought an hour before and then collected, or people that want to do fast, high value transactions can use their brokers. Let's not change the core protocol to suit an edge case for the rich. The risks of centralisation and tyranny are not worth the little convenience it brings to a few.

Thanks to you and for trying to clarifiy. I still don't see why this kind of rule changing would result in blocks being rejected by nodes (and the rejection being effective) while ones containing doublespends by the 51er would not trigger such a fork.

A keylogger would be irrelevant on an offline machine. But then you'll counter with the existence of airgap-busting malware and keyboard sound keylogging.
I wouldn't trust *any* bought CD for a serious amount. You can (and should) verify the *open source, reproducible* iso you choose with the public key of the creator you have chosen to trust. Once burned you can verify it on the offline machine or any other.
If you're saying that every machine in the world has the malware that identifies hacked md5sums (even for isos that haven't been released/updated/conceived of yet) and displays the genuine one instead then you're describing a world that desperately needs bitcoin to curtail the reach of the current powers.

OK, so what you want is one of the passive validators that are in the works. Satellite beams down the blockchain and you can passively (with a battery powered device) check that the paper wallet you receive has the necessary funds on.
Admittedly you can't sweep it without power and you have to accept an amount of trust. Once reputation systems have been deployed and are being widely used you would not risk a black mark on that for sweeping back the price of a cup of coffee.

Going public is now free and crowd-funded with Bitcoin, expansion in their field doesn't need such significant investment (some development and more servers) and they could make acquisitions using a different corporate vehicle without sharing out their existing BTC assets.
So I don't see anything they would want to do that would require USD in exchange for equity. I'm wondering what you think, specifically, the money is needed for. If those were the only things you have then if I was coinbase or others I wouldn't be interested.
Mainstream media is expensive and less effective going forward than the  (viral or) community-based recommendations that have served them so well and I imagine it would be particularly ineffective at this stage for getting new coinbase users unless they found themselves in a war with circle for mainstream users. If circle have big media buddies they could afford to compete unfairly on that front so even then if I was coinbase I would be trying alternatives first.

Making drugs illegal makes them 'cool'. If drugs were pure and available for people to take in a supervised environment there would be few deaths. Doctors sustain opium habits for decades with no outward signs of abuse because they use pure substances, not street shit.

Can you point me to where we can see a transparent audit of funds you hold?
If people are prepared to use changetip they should be aware of the fees:
 * Beginning January 15, 2015, there will be a 1% fee to withdraw from your ChangeTip wallet.
 * The Bitcoin network may charge a transaction a minor fee to move money. ChangeTip has no control over the application of such fees. For more information about Bitcoin transaction fees, see bitcoinfees.com.
Everybody should realise that they do not control their own funds and this company will be skimming 1% of your funds and you could easily be goxxed. This is not what bitcoin is about.

If a miner were to try and credit bob with alice's coin the signature and therefore the tranaction and therefore the block would be invalid. Obviously if the miner has 51% with dishonest software they could get the network to accept it but all honest clients would know there was something fishy going on.
You also seem to be conflating selfish mining with a doublespend. The dishonest miner could simply create many valid transactions in one block, moving their own coins to many addresses they control.
As far as I can tell it seems to boil down to how well wallets validate blocks. They could reject the longest chain because of an invalid coinbase, invalid transaction signature or invalid block containing doublespending transactions. But what do the majority of them actually verify?

There you go. And just to correct you on a few things: Bitcoin is inflationary yet you claim it is deflationary. Central Banks are dumping dollars right now, individual merchants will follow in due course, the smart ones first. Gold has, in the long term, pretty much *held* its value, not *increased* in value.
This paragraph:


There is so much wrong here I assume you're trolling. It has lost 98%, not 17%. That means if you had $98,000,000 dollars in 1913 you would have $1,000,000 dollars now - you have your example backwards. The Wolfram Alpha link you give uses the (manipulated) CPI. In terms of gold it has lost 98%. You say the US economy has tripled, but presumably that includes your "burger manufacturing" industry. America no longer exports anything of substance besides toxic financial assets, war and entertainment that cannot better or more cheaply be obtained elsewhere. I can't remember the last time I saw "Made in USA" on anything, and if I did I would think of the [Labour camps owned by the USA](

It is not enough just to replace the mechanism of currently legitimate trade, we have to support all trade for this to work. As a bonus, when the government gives up trying to regulate the unregulatable they will have more money from taxes and less expenses on the police state.

When they bought their initial users, published terms that said they would sell all your details then changed it when people voiced concern. It's like this, they are a company looking for profit.

I think you get your own escrow account on localbitcoins (I signed up but have never traded) so you would likely get the same coins back but it would look the same as if you just sold them to another user.

Sure, but he could test that with multiple prosses on different ports or local interfaces with some iptables rules or VMs. IMHO he (they) would have had large resources to test this on before launch. After launch they would have known they would be leaving such tracks and so wouldn't have done it.

Im also nervous about sidechains. Seems to me though that sidechain currencies can only be worth at most however much bitcoin is locked. If sidechains were to devalue Bitcoin they would devalue themselves. 
Sidechains also need to secure their own blockchain in some way which makes them somewhat less efficient.
If the sidechain would fail the backing btc would be available again. The danger of people moving to a sidechain and not coming back is a danger though. I'll keep my coins on whatever chain satoshi has theirs on. Bitcoin has all the properties I need from my currency.

Er, no. If you have enough random data you end up accidentally producing a sequence of bytes that match a virus signature. Nobody 'pushed' a virus into the blockchain. That sequence of bytes is data, it is never executed. Try executing /dev/urandom as root and see how long your computer lasts.
All this shows is how dumb virus scanners are and those who rely on them.

I know that coins don't actually get sent from or to an address. In your example using several coin chunks that are controlled by a key represented by the 'sending' address, once ownership is transferred it requires the key of the 'receiving' address to move it further.
It is the key represented by the 'sending' address rather than the 'receiving' address that has become weaker since the public key and signature of the 'sending' key that is now in the blockchain.

OK, and sorry for the late response.
First off, the idea of the blockchain means we're all looking at the same events happening at the same time. All the staging of information that has been used by cronies is gone. Think burying bad news, movie releases by region, keeping other countries down, divide and rule etc.
Second, I think the relentless inevitability of the next block discovery drives the pace of innovation by pitting people against each other on a global scale. There is no uncompetitive advantage, it is a true meritocracy/technocracy. This competition is also driven by the idea that the sooner you launch the sooner you can grab first mover advantage and your early trades will be larger than a company coming along a year later could ever hope to achieve, driven by the progression of the blockchain (reward halving) and adoption.
I'll especially agree with pa2013 and cryptolynx - patience is required waiting for the world to catch up. When I was learning Linux years ago I complained at a LUG meet that it was moving to fast to keep up with. A more experienced Linux user complained instead it was too slow.
What was actually going on was that I was catching up, learning what he already knew. When I got into Bitcoin about 18 months ago I was so gripped by every piece of news that I want to (and you currently can) know just about everything about it. With Bitcoin I'm where that other Linux user was, waiting for the world to catch up with the implications of the cutting edge.

Thanks for the detailed reply. Sorry for the delay, was watching the imitation game in the cinema. I'm sure you're doing everything you can. I'm guessing you're using OT. I do have a few questions though.
Why would waiting not create infungibility? It seems to me that if regulations enforced infungibility the value would plummet proportional to the size of that jurisdiction. The losses to such a jurisdiction would be immeasurable.
Coinvalidation is a worthy thing to avoid but is that not just at the fiat gateway? There are plenty of ways to shuffle coins around to give anonymity once inside crypto. What is your primary focus, regulatory compliance or anonymity?
Sorry for a bunch of broad questions but I can't tell from your site what you're thinking. Sitting idle (the website) for ten months is like a decade in Bitcoin.

Another related issue is being able to make multiple payments in the same block. Hopefully wallets in the future will use multiple change addresses for transactions so in the future multiple transactions can be performed in the same block. Perhaps the wallet could note that you typically make ~10mbtc payments so split the change into say 15mbtc chunks to allow you to spend rapidly in the future.

I said inflation and bail-ins are kinds of stealing. I did not say making other people's property less valuable is stealing - you are twisting my words.


We were talking about n of m, not nFA. The 2FA that I mentioned is their key plus an SMS (assuming they do that). If you generate two keys in your browser you have enough to spend the bitcoin, just like you would if you had access to a username and password (which is 1FA).

Here's a 'provably honest' way to present your business case of being able to predict the market:
1. Make your predictions for the week. Maybe it's "buy BTC wednesday morning" or "short LTC when the MACD crosses". Something that demonstrates foresight. Write them in (separate) text files.
1. For each prediction in a text file produce a hash of it. Weekly (say) publish a text file containing these hashes with the earliest dates they could be demonstrated to have come true.
1. Hash that file and record it in the blockchain, perhaps using the proof of existence website.
1. Now your predictions are timestamped and able to be disclosed to the world as the dates on them arrive and you can't remove the losing bets from your history (like if you had actually broke even you could not disclose the losing bets).
I hope I'm explaining this well enough. This is a simple, first thought of what people into crypto that are looking for even more risk should be looking at in terms of investment guarantees.
Personally, Bitcoin is quite risky enough for me.

Which wallets wants 2FA to decrypt keys? The 2FA I've seen is to webwallets that explicitly manage your private keys themselves. Blockchain.info explicitly don't.
If you think of blockchain.info wallets as a dropbox for your encrypted keys, an API to post transactions to and a separate bit of javascript that handles your dtaa in your browser then it makes more sense. Perhaps it has got more complex just when new users are looking for a simpler interface, I don't know.
If you ask me, the private keys shouldn't be on your computer in the first place. If they are then only for occasional spending wallets. Regarding backups, my research leads me to it being an AES-256 scheme and not known to be a vulnerable implementation. You can see the source needed to decrypt it in their code on github and in multibit's code as well. If you are saying there is something wrong with the implementation in either of these places please be specific.
There is nothing stopping you having a separate browser just for doing blockchain.info stuff if you're the sort of person that likes to install every browser extension you can find.
Any web wallet that doesn't let you manage your own keys is more insecure (from the third party disappearing, just like mt.gox).

I never just believe what I read on the net. I think I misunderstand you rather than not believe you. From your references:
The attacker can't:
 * Reverse other people's transactions
 * Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
 * Change the number of coins generated per block
 * Create coins out of thin air
 * **Send coins that never belonged to him**
So in your example was Mallory was sending Alice the coins first and wasn't just the dishonest miner in this scenario? I'm sorry to hear you won't discuss it any more, though the points you are discussing are not quite the point I was trying to make.
Can anyone else help me understand why it is not the case that a dishonest miner with &gt;50% of the hashing power and &gt;50% of the full nodes couldn't change the protocol (even if honest nodes wouldn't honour the new blocks created) then please do. I have read just about everything about how Bitcoin works over the last year so I'm not starting from a position of total ignorance.
From the whitepaper (regarding SPV clients):


vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes **can** verify 
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated 
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.
So the question I'm asking is, if a sustained attack of this type happened now, how many wallets would reject the dishonest chain if 1) the miner double-spent his own coins or 2) the miner increased the coinbase or 3) the miner included transactions with invalid signatures?

I've just introduced a first year economics student to it.
Her lecturer mentioned Hayek as an alternative to the 99.9 % of the course material when she questioned the assumptions of the problems she was set. She is intelligent, self-motivated and principled and welcomed the most full-on explaination that only two or three hours and freely flowing beer can muster.
As a sweeping generalisation women understand that cooperation is less destructive (and therefore more desirable) than competition. Money has always had a competitive side and maybe bitcoin shows it can have a cooperative side too. The yin and yang of money perhaps and the birth of a society that has matriarchal and patriarchal aspects that agree with each other. Might be waffling now, had a few (hic)
So maybe my answer is to find female economics first years and see if some of them like the look of the rabbit hole. Even if they cant invest themselves they will be the family money geek and could be pursuasive with older money.

There was precious metal coins which needed little trust. Since paper currency every world reserve has collapsed through abuse of trust. Our current banking system relies on obfuscated trust and electricity.

I'm not interested in having a debate about trading here, that's for r/BitcoinMarkets. The only discussion about trading that makes sense in this sub is how Bitcoin differs to all other traded items, namely greatly.
I've never traded a stock before because they have all seemed like snake oil. Being able to remove the snake oil vendor from the equation is why I like Bitcoin.
I've not invested more than I can afford to lose and have the patience of a saint waiting for the shorters to run out of coins and the next few reward halvings. I'm very content with the number of coins I have regardless of the meaningless dollar value I paid for them. Though with bargains like this to be had it's hard to resist.
Most of the volume traded over the last year would have been between traders although this would be hard to prove myself as I don't trade. As a physicist I would look instead at the coin generation rates and note the following:
Back then there were 12 million coins in circulation and now there are 13.5 million. So if 12 million coins were in the hands of happy owners this time last year there can be only 1.5 million in the hands of owners still waiting to see a profit.
Unless you started playing dice or shorting or any of those other games you like to play that Bitcoin is designed to be resistant to, in which case you only have yourself to blame.

Over half of that was Lehman brothers. So might as well just put aside  6 weeks of fed money printing and let people off with their premiums. Or, you know, prosecute those that obviously need prosecuting for their corruption.
They might have been useful in the past, but I doubt they are going to keep their 99% track record after the coming collapse of the legacy finance system. A record that is easily achievable with an inflating currency.

They are working on it. Several of the changes in the last few releases of the reference client have been changes that needed to be made to wallet code and miner code in order to pave the way for floating fees. Which in turn will help keep down blockchain bloat as we scale.
10MB implies 1k per tx but it's half that or less.  I come out with a figure of 432GB per day though - 500b * 10000tps * 60 * 60 *24. So running the world's banking a few years from now requires as much disk space as a handful of keen torrenters today.

Sorry, I'm not convinced. I see that list of what they can and can't do in many places but just think about it for a minute.
It is easy to get a majority of nodes for relaying bad blocks and transactions while limiting the propagation of others. If someone then has 51% of hashing power they can run modified code that accepts higher coinbases as valid. Honest nodes including non-mining full clients would not be able to validate the longest blockchain.
Whether all wallets validate the coinbase as well as doublespends I don't know.  Whether they could do anything about it if 51% of the hashing power disagrees I also dont know.
I suspect a fork would happen, though why a fork due to invalid coinbase value would be any more impossible than a double spending fork I couldnt say.
**tl; dr** the software 51% of the hashing power runs *is* the bitcoin protocol.

The moment I saw it on slashdot February last year, based on my understanding of computing.
When there was no warning or encouragement from all governments (or media) about it within two or three weeks I figured they knew it was in their best interest to free themselves from the grip of the banks and they knew it had to be a grass roots project in order to succeed.
I still can't decide if it was a black ops or presented to them by the crypto community just before I discovered it but it doesn't matter. There is such overlap between the crypto community and the government crypto people at that level that they are one and the same and have similar agendas.

I have a problem with the number of false positives that can arise with these techniques. Let's say I owe a friend £20. I ask him for the address to send it to and he gives me a silk road address (I've no idea how it actually presents to the user) to pay it into. Now from the blockchain it looks like I bought drugs.
There have been suggestions that the number of on-chain transactions can be reduced by businesses doing just this. I pay my supplier directly by getting my customers to pay to their addresses. I've also no idea if the addresses the supplier gave me are owned by them or the suppliers they owe.
This way it is not possible to extract such clear information without several off-chain ledgers and the number of false positives will hopefully make sure these kind of investigations end up being fruitless.

Personally none, though there are some out there. Others have chosen a way of life that falls into an exemption. If only people would understand the power they have by acting collectively. 
My point was there *is* something bitcoin can do about that. Prevent them from taking your money. They can currently take money from your bank account or future salary or assets from your home and some people still see this as being without force.
They would have to crack out the $5 wrench to get your bitcoin. I look forward to a future where taxes are paid voluntarily because we can see that they are going where we want them to go.

Depends on how much cash people actually had on them when it all switches off. The wealthy could be someone with £100 in their pocket, people with more money but who only uses cards would be the new poor. Barter and tabs would prevail until the power and internet needed to determine account balances was restored. Those systems would be more fragile, interdependent and harder to bring back online than the bitcoin network.

They will buy any remaining physical gold from America with those very dollars, then demand a stronger currency once the dollar collapses, perhaps Bitcoin, it depends how many months (to a few years) the dollar has left.


Didn't ban, just another consumer warning:  No, we're not going to move the world reserve currency to the Ruble, we're going to move it to Bitcoin otherwise the same bad shit happens all over again.


No, 2140. And yes [Monetary Inflation]( is a thing.


The USD will stop being created once nobody wants it. Every loan made is new *debt* created. No need for loans to stop but Bitcoin loans won't be around until adoption is much higher.


It doesn't inflate after that, but it doesn't deflate beyond people losing their coins. If we get that far then we will likely have very different problems to solve and hopefully a world that has been rescued from the brink of destruction on an industrial scale. Sorry, I don't know much of the economics of other coins, except that their value is negligible.

I like the idea and it could be integrated into android wallets. I'd really like to see a signed challenge response message from the wallet though as part of the process.  It's easy to send a message that appears to come from any phone number and combined with sniffing and jamming bob's signal alice could end up sending money to a hacker.
The phone itself is still a weakpoint but at least we shouldn't weaken the security it already has. Also, rate limiting this is important. Don't want people using it to get loads of bob's addresses that another deterministic wallet might reuse or end up leaking intermediaye values by signing messages repeatedly with the same key.

Companies should be able to decide what they consider "retained earnings" to be vs operating Bitcoin wallet. If their operating Bitcoin is actually a cold wallet then they side-step this requirement.

It would be nice if could confirm that companies can keep their retained earnings in Bitcoin to avoid this unregulatable situation.

Regulations are not applied to bitcoin, it is self-regulating by design. None of the NY regs affect Bitcoin. Regulations apply restrictions to people by means of the threat of force.
If New Yorkers are fine with that then the rest of the world doesn't care. If New Yorkers want to not be treated like babies then they need to stop these regulations being applied to *them*.

I can see all the little £1 or £2 transactions I made when setting up random strangers but it would be nice to be able to easily see how they cluster over time and how many have unspent outputs vs people actually using them.

A 30% drop for a few hours. Meh. It would be up more if we thought those coins were gone. Instead this was a land grab by an established power that is protecting Mark.
In no particular order it could be the Japanese, American or other government not happy with Satoshi's potential support, one of the banker-killing banks, hackers or even Mark himself.
It doesn't matter, just that the coins are not likely destroyed and they are not fairly distributed and the market has priced that in. Hence I'm saying this incident did affect the growth of bitcoin but in the 3 to 5 year timescale it doesnt really matter about the market. The land grab is about power.

The banks aren't changing much because to make a change adds to the overhead of maintaining a Heath Robinson system for accounting and reconciliation.

Are you talking about privacy of people moving their funds to and from decentralised-bob-backed-lighting-contracts (savings accounts) and their own lightning-contracts (coffee money) and their larger purchases (unencumbered bitcoin)?

Their original terms explicitly said they would be selling your data. That changed but I don't believe them as they have been far from transparent. They have also moved the date the fee starts before. Gotta give out enough free crack to the kids so they get hooked.
I predict they will steadily increase the fee after it is introduced and then gox the lot after another year or two (they hold all private keys).
We have no idea how many funds they hold or how fractional their reserve is. Moving the fee date could also be to defer a run that would demonstrate their insolvency.

Let's see, when the dollar collapses other currencies become relatively stronger overnight and more people around the world can buy more of what china is selling. There will be some disruption to China's exports - they will now go to BRIC nations, their African partners, Russia and Europe.
If America isn't buying because it's now able to buy cheaper Vietnamese products then yes, China loses out to Vietnam. If America isn't buying because their currency has collapsed then China is not losing out. They get to make slightly less product and charge slightly more for it to the rest of the world that can still afford it.

Namecoin rewards are NMC.
Fiatcoin was proposed last year but is it built? If privately mined it doesn't benefit from a blockchain.
Bitmessage only uses a blockchain (if at all) to hold messages for a few days, not much more than the mempool. Hence why no bitmessage currency.
Votecoin, from your description there is no incentive to mine. Better just use Bitcoin coloured coins with government approved addresses.
You have failed to separate a useful application that requires a blockchain from the reward incentive required to mine it.

Not sure how PCR works in any detail. I know it copies DNA but I have no idea of the energy (theoretical minimum or actual with today's tech). As I understand, the first molecule is printed kinda mechanically and the rest it's a biochemical reaction, though I could well be wrong.
I'm open to suggestions about all this including the reading. The answers (the nonces) could be encoded ahead of time. We just need to do something at the molecular level once the tRNA has found the hash to indicate which nonce met the difficulty. I imagine nature would be a good place to start, enabling some molecule to start copying the answer or machines that cpoy the answer.
Perhaps we could have the nonces fighting for the receptor - once the tRNA has found a hash that doesn't meet the difficulty it releases it so another can bind. We don't have to be perfectly systematic.

Not arbitrary, in the interest of the hardware available. Do you run a node? Do you mine? Then you're not incurring the cost of securing the network.
I agree with you that very low fees are important and free-for-all would be a dream come true but as block rewards recede it is the transaction fees that will secure the network. This is unavoidable until we transition to vastly cheaper storage, cpu and bandwidth and something like proof of idle.
I'm sorry to hear you don't think Bitcoin will lead to a better world. Maybe you're just in it for personal gain. Good luck!

I think you misunderstand me. Let me break down the meaning behind my words:


I'm not being derogatory; OP said exactly this.


I have a background in IT support at all levels. Diagnosing front-line issues at 3am was the most fun. When making decisions to serve as diagnostic information you have to be sure of what you know otherwise the diagnosis may be false. See Kepner-Tregoe for example. 


OP's point 3 makes assumptions about the attackers intentions that may not be true. Just because the attacker takes 6 BTC and doesn't take 0.01 does not tell you anything. This is OP's first hack but the thief's umpteenth. Leaving 0.01 as bait might seem clever but like anything, once you know it, it seems obvious.
Knowing the history of the devices that generated the keys would be more useful. Also, the 'hack' is perceived at being at the same time as the funds moved but this does not have to be the case.
I wish this didn't happen to OP and I'm glad they shared to continue the tradition of warning others. I do care, I'm with the Bitcoin faithful and know it will win out with truth and people changing their behaviour, not sugar-coating it. The things I tell OP are no more negative than the reality of the situation and I will not stop, no.
@_date: 2015-05-02 23:01:19
I can imagine a decentralised Bob where you move coins to back Bob's contracts and earn interest like a savings account. The money comes from the (cheaper) lightning network fees from others. I think that would form the largest lightning network, eclipsing private efforts.
The lightning network does have these problems until we take the leap to a decentralised Bob.

Edit: In before the corrections, **on average** for less than 50% makes sense. In the special case of just over over 50% this means the minority might be slightly luckier at times and find blocks faster than the majority.
The proof of work will be greater for the majority (it is just the difficulty, not the number of hashes actually attempted) but if they get a run of bad luck and can't solve a block to bury the double-spend, while the honest nodes luck out and get a couple in a row, the attack could fail. An attacker would also likely run a Sybil attack to suppress blocks from honest nodes to at least offset this.
Maybe 51% vs 50% covers that variance in block discovery luck. Which would mean that other coins with different block times might have a slightly different point where the chance of failing to perform an attack theoretically (assuming block discovery time/variance is tending to 0) vs practically (with the block discovery/variance being specified/derived in the particular coin's spec) is the particular value you want.


mations will reduce the success rate below 100%.

From the wiki, one clock period is 11.5ms and it is a CISC machine that still takes several clock cycles to perform an operation. So say 50ms or 20 hz.
This helps me estimate how fast a 3d printed mechanical computer could do it. Say we could achieve 2hz that would be 800 seconds per double sha. Now if I knew how long the 1410 would take to do the ecdsa signing I could have a ball park figure of how fast (worst case) a 3d printed mechanical computer could sign a transaction.

The ideas that still discourage centralisation include pruning, market-based fees and headers first block propagation before raising the block size arbitrarily and they are being worked on by Gavin. There's a bunch of changes that have gone through/are going through that need to be done in sequence to get there. There's also Moore's Law on the side of decentralisation.
It's good that people aren't assuming Bitcoin is perfectly anonymous without effort because that's not how it was designed. Before Bitcoin incorporates anonymity in its protocol (probably via a sidechain) or wallets with coin selection we'll see alts and third party services continue to dominate this space.
Also, cash has serial numbers but people feel comfortable doing all sorts of dodgy things with that. Most people I know using Bitcoin are not doing anything illegal with it.
Partial spending patterns could be linked to a pseudonym via analysis. One vendor could reveal the ID of a pseudonym though I'd say there's a stronger business case for them not to. Right now the NSA et. al. have full R/W access to your accounts. The ability for anyone having flakey partial read at worst sounds like an improvement to me.

If there was ever a weakness in the ecdsa bitcoin uses it might be the case of miners upgrading, wallets upgrading and your hot coins automatically moved like the java.random weakness, then you should move your coins to an address secured by the new key type.
A more serious bug in ecdsa would possibly allow thieves to move all coins quickly which would require a hard fork back to before the theif started as well as all the rest of the measures and not too many lost coins or loss of confidence to rescue bitcoin.

People who aren't trading don't care if the exchange is fractional as long as they don't have a run while they're exchanging.

I'm guessing also that it's more accurate to call a time rather than a block height with something so far in the future.
Nobody knows how mining is going to go over the next 10 months. Hashpower increasing means we'll get there sooner while hashpower decreasing means we'll get there later.
Hashpower changing over a long time can cause 10-20% difference between expected and actual time that blocks of a certain height arrive.

The peer to peer aspect suggests to me it's how I might settle up for buying something from one of my peers. As such, it might well be a low value transaction. More to the point, it's the common electronic payment method that we both prefer, so more like bank transfers, cash and personal lines of credit.
The store of value has to be secondary to being a useful payment network. That you will be able to spend your bitcoin next year depends on a wider market, which depends on lots of users.
Since paper gold is already traded at inflated volumes to control the physical there's very little difference between gold and fiat right now anyway, but I digress.
There's no use case I can see for using Bitcoin as an open settlement system supporting the upper layers if one group has control of most miners. You might as well use a private, permissioned blockchain (database).
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:44:57

@_date: 2016-03-03 21:25:10
I don't believe that will happen even if we removed the limit completely, and others have proved the sky certainly wouldn't fall with a modest increase. 
Node centralisation is less of a concern to me than miner centralisation as the barrier to entry to correct an imbalance remains less. As Gavin wrote, it's possible to run transactions at close to mastercard levels on his home computer and connection. A few iterations of Moore's law and much greater than that is possible. 
Going into a datacentre with a node at that scale even today is affordable for the serious hobbyist, especially with features like thin blocks and pruning and so on. Datacentres does not undermine the decentralised nature of Bitcoin as much as the distributed nature (which right now is less of a threat). However, mining managed by only a few people undermines the decentralised nature of Bitcoin and that is more important than the fact that the distributed nature is also impacted by datacentres being used. 
Users can decide how much node decentralisation they want by leaving Bitcoin for alts or layer 2 solutions if it becomes an unsolvable problem rather than being forced to move now to a system that doesn't exist. If Bitcoin hits a limit I want it to because market forces said so, not a cartel that happens to be selling solutions. Otherwise we've learned nothing useful from the experiment.

I'm aware of FATF and it is specific examples of the abuse of this that I'm most curious about. 
I guess because the exchanges need bank accounts they can get the banks to deny stable accounts to those that don't comply, hence the period during 2014/15 where bank accounts of exchanges were being shut down and KYC was brought in almost all over the place.
Would you agree that, in theory at least, the US should have no jurisdiction over non-us users of a non-us site trading in a non-us country and non-us currency? I live in the UK btw.
I'd say the volume that's most traded is the closest to an 'official' currency that BTC is priced in, though it is now the Yuan anyway if you believe the exchange volumes.

There are simpler ways to fix the traffic on that 84 lane interstate you're stuck on. Give tax breaks for telecommuting and flexitime.

On the plus side:
 * we have a better understanding of real mempool limits
 * we have a better understanding of real miner reaction to spam
 * we have a better understanding of attackers means and intentions
 * we've exhausted the 'if' discussion about block size and considered lots of options for the 'how'.
@_date: 2015-08-18 21:06:20
This is slower than Moore's law and simply sets the new status quo of max block size in motion and on track for returning to no limit. If $REASONS arise it can be changed to $BLOCKSIZEGROWTHALGORITHM as it would have been shown.
Decentralisation is preserved in that there will be many miners and nobody you need to ask permission from to start mining, not that you can run the world's cash transactions and more on a laptop in the jungle. There are many other options for scaling that the network can converge on even after the fork, roll-forward if you like, doing nothing is unlikely to win. We should not fear change, that's the old way.
I hope we see more clients and more modular and user-decided features/defaults to avoid bundling unpopular changes with a popular one. I also hope miners are tagging their blocks with their choices so we can see the way the miners want to go. I'm sure it has a BIP already.
@_date: 2015-08-13 21:35:17
Well there's the stratum network for miners that I know very little about but I understand that otherwise miners would like a number of peers to be sure they get both transactions (maybe to max fees) and blocks as fast as they can, as well as broadcast their blocks to as many other miners as quickly as possible. FLBT (if i got that right) sends the rules the miner uses to the other miners to avoid needing that bandwidth burst.
So we armchair miners can't see what the problem is it seems.
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:02:33
One machine can produce many spam transactions. Invalid transactions are not propagated across the network, valid ones cost a small fee.
The ledger is fixed in size so this causes regular users to have to up their fee to be included right away. Everyone has a copy of the ledger so reading it does not need to go over the network.
Caveat: simplification.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:20:50
Or some people that want small blocks (and are early adopters) want it to look like the market doesn't like large blocks. Obviously cock-up would be more likely than conspiracy, but I would not be surprised if conspiracy helped in this case.

If the economic majority decides they won't accept just the longest valid chain but from a certain block height a valid signature from a key is required in the coinbase free form field, that other miners agree is a non-governmental miner.

I really can't see that vector being fruitful but if it did go down that way (with all countries agreeing) I would see SSL, steganography or even an alt coin as a better defence than Tor.
Tor seems like a really low priority core feature and not something that deserves much representation in the block size debate.
If you're thinking about growing Tor as Bitcoin grows and making it default for the net then that's laudable. If Tor is the only way to run a node then some would say we have already lost.

Are you in a position to determine the version string or are you pooled? You're really telling me that miners consider faking the version string a sensible thing to do?

I knew XT increased over the years but not the specifics because it does not matter. If we can change it once we can change it again. There's no gurantee that XT will still be the most popular set of features/defaults by the time it rises beyond 8M. If it chooses well it lives, wrong and something else is called bitcoin. Right now it only has to offer a choice other than standing still to win.
Anyway, this all does not matter in the slightest because either you have bigger blocks with most transactions on-chain or you have sidechains and LN and you then have to hold those databases too to be able to claim to be a fully decentralised, fully validating nodes.

And if the choice that merchants have is between core and XT they will choose the one that delivers reliability to their customers (which ideally would be the one which had the majority of hashpower and nodes, failing that they would side with the hashpower and deploy more nodes).
Merchants are also more likely to favour large blocks since their business models were built around growing a user-base around payments, not settlements.
Also, I don't understand why miners would be so self-destructive as to fake the version data. Sure, a few pranksters, but a significant proportion of miners suddenly coming over all suicidal? I doubt it, besides we are at the mercy of that any day of the week.

What rewards will induce the hash power to secure the network when block rewards are gone? The answer is only fees. There are two competing ways fees can do it. Either lots of small fees through lots of transactions (which will consume huge amounts of resources and cause the centralization of Bitcoin) or through fewer BC transactions with larger fees, which protects decentralization. However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave. If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, Bitcoin would be vulnerable. This is the scenario that happens under an implementation of both XT and Lightning. Why would we hinder LN, the more elegant solution, when cap increase is not urgent? It makes no sense.
What are you jabbering on about man? It is you that makes no sense. You keep repeating yourself, you must acknowledge that LN, cool as it is, is not as elegant as raising the blocksize? 
It is a different solution to a different problem at a different layer of the stack anyway. It enables guaranteed zeroconf. It is caching to Bitcoin's app server. It will have its place. But even the LN developers want a raise in the block size.
I'm sure I will be res-tagged forever as 'the guy who didn't know that 8GB was hard-coded into XT'. Well...
    redfacedquark grep -Ri 8GB .
    Binary file ./src/qt/res/icons/bitcoin.icns matches

No, without miners choosing to sacrifice short term gains for for the long term interest of Bitcoin, which they did and will again. When the sky doesn't fall it is only people like you that will be proved wrong. The block stream guys won't go on record directly with specific concerns for fear of looking foolish if core capitulates and everything continues to work.

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Inaccuracies are still Inaccuracies when presented in a scary voice. There may be a grain of truth in there somewhere but some of the facts are wrong and it is not being argued from reason, just fear. I made it halfway through.
What you're feeling I think (having considered it before) is the fear of being tricked into tricking others into a dystopia. The options are:
1. we stay the same and join the butters
2. It really is as good as it seems
3. It was the best laid plan in history, requires making people realise that they have the power to define their own currency, then try to take it back again without us realising we can fork? That's not bold, that's fucking stupid.
4. they saw it coming, realised it would free them from the tyranny of the banks and fired up a few nodes early on but accept a smaller role in the future.

We know that it's difficult to get feature/bug parity between different implementations (WINE anyone?) and that argument is often levied against XT. I'd support that argument against some features XT but not the max block size. You could also consider the dodged bullet that was the potential openssl fork. Exactly the same thing, essentially consensus code being handled by an external library. 
Both of these issues involved inconsistent validators. The validator for the max block size is as simple as it comes and is not changing, only the value. The potential sources of problem is of an individual miner's resources being insufficient. If some miners feel disadvantaged they should support the development of [IBLT](
Before these issues, bitcoin core hadn't been re-factored to clearly delineate code relating to consensus from the rest. This was partially done to allow other clients to be implemented without these edge cases.

To me the gentoo issue is similar to the SPF settings on mail software.
Discussions happened at the distro level from what I recall, particularly Debian. It was understood that there are decisions when packaging that affect the protocol and that the distro had a responsibility to make the default decision for their users based on the distro's philosophy.
I'm not sure what gentoo's philosophy is or how that could be expressed by setting package defaults, though it wouldn't surprise me to hear that with gentoo there are cases where explicit user choices are required.

A million HD wallets per night is nothing, but more important than the numbers is the concept I need you to understand: you are NOT eliminating the millions of addresses.
The addresses in no way help you predict what the twelve words to a winning wallet will be. Targeting HD wallets rather than private keys directly does not reduce the search space to a more manageable level. It does however *increase* the difficulty of calculating the first key (see: "Type 2 hierarchical deterministic wallet...The seed is used after 100,000 rounds of SHA256 to slow down attacks..." in my link above).
Back to the numbers, unless you have a list of those private keys you have no way of knowing you've searched them. 32 bytes times your million is a somewhat reasonable 32MB/night but to be effective on average in 15 years on one (random) wallet you'd need to be storing 10^35 bytes (a billion yotta bytes) per second (it goes giga-peta-exa-zetta-yotta) to say nothing of the kind of RAM/DB would be behind your "Enterprise IT" system or how many power stations it would need to operate. You can at least double that as well as you can't look up by private key, you'd need to store the address alongside it.

4k word lists of 12 words is 4k^12 = 2e43 which is still on the large side. I get what you're saying, if you get the seed you have more keys to check but I think generating the next key in a HD wallet is just as intensive as generating a single key and reduces your ability to parallelise the task.

I believe the idea is to have a substantial delay (a day or so in the video I saw) to redeeming the Bitcoin to guard against a serious re-org on the side-chain.
If the sidechain disappears I believe that would mean nobody was mining it, or that it was so broken it was not possible to run a node. If people had an investment in a side-chain they would have the motivation to run a node to be able to withdraw.
It is more likely several people would be mining it in different directions, hence the requirement for the many confirmations of the transaction on the sidechain that is 'cashing out'.
If there are no nodes and no stable blockchain there is no value in the sidechain and the bitcoin that were locked against them would (presumably) either be burned or returned to the investors on some dead-man's handle, whatever rules were defined at the sidechain's inception.
Edit: skating at the edge of my knowledge here but I believe the dead man's handle could be implemented as part of the merged mining rules where solutions are accepted from both chains (at different difficulties) and so there should be a number of Bitcoin blocks in a row that indicate the merge-mined chain is dead.

So support [IBLT]( since that's clearly what the miners want.
So the whole network should be limited to support small, Tor miners who can't be arsed running a full node over the clearnet and using an out-of-band air-gap to pass the headers to the tor node?
It looks to me from the [bc.i pool list]( that more that 90% of the hashing power is 'out and proud'. It is going to be harder to hide a significant amount of hashing power going forwards anyway.
If small, dodgy miners CBA using the two techniques above why should we support them further by over-complicating *our* lives? And with much greater complication than the two solutions mentioned above.
Every other part of this drivel conveniently ignores these two, simple technologies in order to make the same, tired point. As do all these guys when pressed about them in the fora. The argument is only somewhat cogent if you ignore these two, simple changes that need to be implemented by the minority groups that need them.


The government could walk up now and try to regulate the incumbent, open mining majority. Small blocks don't save us from that. What saves us from that is recognising that censorship is happening and to add a signature from a mining web of trust that does not censor to wallets and nodes to only recognise the longest chain where blocks were signed by that WoT.
Simples! ;)

In order to find out what those addresses are you need to generate each one using the previous one.  If the HD wallet user started by generating a bunch of receive addresses they will leave empty (recommended) you have to decide how many more to generate and check before ruling out that wallet.
True, there's also nothing to stop someone picking one of the HD addresses or another HD wallet crossing it. Very unlikely, obv.
Very unlikely is also a phrase that should be associated with the 2e43 number I mentioned. If 10bn people each had 10bn HD wallets each, each with a satoshi in it, you'd still have to check ~ 5e34 HD wallets before you found one, on average. If you could check a billion a second you'd need 5e25 seconds to find one, 3.15569e7 = 1.6 billion billion years.
Houston, can I get a check on my arithmetic please? If these numbers are wrong who knows where we could end up. Disclaimer: I reserve the right to be out by a factor of ten in two places.

IMHO if you leave your coins on an exchange then you give them the right to sign messages with them and I don't have a problem with that as long as it is widely understood. The fact that coinbase offer to sign messages you provide is a feature for sure, but does not change the fact that they hold your coins and they could move them and sign a message voting the other way as soon as you've finished. It also means you have to expose that message to them.
Exchanges can move all the coins under their control so moving coins won't work for a vote. Also, I could pay for goods and use the address the merchant gave me as the voting address. I've now voted and I no longer own the coins. What if the merchant then votes. What then? Can we just keep moving coins from A &gt; B &gt; C... and vote with A, B and C?
The only way to know for sure is to involve an exact time and only count messages signed by an address to the value of funds they have at that time.
I've no interest in discussing with luke-jr things that luke-jr considers pet peeves while the censorship and irrational behaviour remains (ignoring reasonable points that invalidate their arguments). I have a wall here I can bang my head against, it would likely be more productive.

Nope, you just think it is.


Who is this chosen 'we'? As is being explained in this thread, it only takes a majority of miners or merchants to make a decision. The requirements cannot be relaxed as there are no more requirements that'the majority agree'.

I had a feeling I would have to elaborate. I understand your countrymen are generally not very aware of what happens outside your borders. I will show you how our software developers are highly paid, almost certainly more so than those employed by your large companies that take the profits.
I'm a software consultant. An independent purveyor of open source solutions to clients from government agencies and private industry. I usually only have one main client at a time and this allows me to focus on their needs much better than a larger company.
I recognised the value of such a business model in the early naughties and adjusted my career appropriately. Some time after your banks fucked us over, our government [decided]( it was phasing out awarding contracts to big US companies that overcharged and provided poor service.
By hiring small, independent software consultants they were able to develop services for their citizens in an extremely agile way, reducing their costs by 80-90% in many cases. They even open-sourced this work so this work could be re-used by any country and reviewed and improved by anyone needing to overhaul their IT services for their citizens, here's [one of their github accounts](
Besides the cost savings the government now owns its own projects rather than being beholden to a years old contract to deliver something that has become irrelevant. Contractors can come and go, there's no hiding bad code and the latest best practices of the private sector are used which delivers a better product that is more maintainable by the next consultant that comes along.
This is what I mean by quality over quantity. Total spent on software is not a good measure of its effectiveness, just as GDP is no longer a good measure of the health of a country's economy. Also, on top of the massive cost savings the local talent get the spoils and are more likely to pay tax and spend that money in the UK economy.
Another example: earlier in my career, before I went contracting, I was a permie on a measly £30,000. A CRM solution was bought for £250,000+ from a half-billion dollar software company. The highly paid consultants of this closed source (they actually didn't have the source to some components) took 6-9 months to get this up and running (our DB was Oracle and though they claimed to support it they appeared to be doing it as they went along).
A solution was needed before this and over the first month or two I cooked them up something part-time that was better than the spreadsheets they were using and provided maybe 80% of the features they wanted from the product they were buying.
My current client has also had a bad history with large software vendors being more interested in extracting money from the contract rather than focussing on delivering a great product. They now have an in-house agile team with a velocity that increases every sprint and delivers exactly what their users require, even if they change their requirements from sprint to sprint.
Quality, not quantity.

Yes they can, in as much as it matters. If miners have different minimum fees the user can choose the lower fee and they may have to wait a few blocks before being confirmed. Thus a free market for fees exists - first class or second class if you will.
This somewhat applies to censorship (e.g. 1dice) and replace-by-fee thing too.

Both these issues would affect the fiat system severely as well. There is not enough physical cash to allow fiat to function without the digital pounds and dollars. A globally destructive solar flare would break the derivatives trading which would crash the system anyway.

I wasn't, I was talking about the terrible MSPs and snakeoil vendors below them that gouge and cheat to make their livings. But since you brought the big ones up, let's add CISCO to the list and take a look at [where]( those companies keep their money to hide it from your government (hint: it's called the Double Irish Arrangement).
People pay for windows because Microsoft themselves bully manufacturers into not making other offerings. People buy Apple because they like shiny. Less than 2% run Linux, unless you count web and other servers running some version of Linux and the [80% market share]( that Android has.
The trend that I'm seeing now is for cheap Chinese Android phones and phablets which bodes well for Linux but less for the names you mentioned.

There are many different questions and audiences. 
There's not much point in burning your savings to vote on some decision that affects your savings. There will always be a wealth disparity and I would consider any burning or fee voting to be particularly unpleasant as it is easier for the rich to partake than the poor.
The message signing I'm talking about is the idealised proof of solvency. Most exchanges that do this don't necessarily go as far as they could, like by signing with funds that will be there at a particular time to prove the same coins were not counted twice. As for the linked article being 'a bit shit' I agree. Besides tying up your coins and vague hand-waving about wallet interoperability and contradictory statements about whether their software ever has access to your coins, I see no details of their claims of being publicly auditable. Seems we just have to trust them to point to some addresses and say look, people voted this way. 
When applied to proof of stake voting (either for consensus rules or some random reason barely related to Bitcoin) there can always be votes bought and sold, but then people could just buy Bitcoin, vote and then sell it again, i.e. there would be a market for votes. Any question being asked to this audience must take this into account.

Those running core were dropping the spam due to their sorting by fee, another particular client was preserving it by dropping different transactions on individual nodes and relying on the clients effectively operating a distributed mempool.
Compare [tradeblock on core]( with [statoshi on another particular client](

You may be right, though a transaction could be malleated after being mined due a a reorg. Sidechains wait for their own maturity of related transactions so I suppose this should not be a problem.
I'm probably thinking of LN requiring both and two way pegs only requiring the opcode, not the malleability fix. Crazy to think we're only one opcode away from a two way peg.

In general, very few trades happen at the correct price and usually the merchant gets the advantage. When competition is not allowed this problem is exacerbated. We could call that a scam too.
Fiat scams are worse because they become legitimised and are allowed to operate indefinately.

$ bitcoin-cli getmempoolinfo
    "size" : 90159,
    "bytes" : 1151027992
I watched all this last time, it's fascinating.
I use a client that drops random transactions from the mempool rather than the more common clients that use a prioritisation that changes and increases in complexity as time goes by, a bit like those virus definition updates that windows users may know.
I think random is a nice, simple, robust approach to managing the mempool and a poignant time in Bitcoin's life -- **the mempool has gone global**. The implications of even a small proportion of clients contributing to this global mempool means it's very hard to get rid of transactions as they remain valid and mine-able forever.
If any miners at all decide to include these valid low fee transactions (that they heard about from a member of the global mempool) then you will download them in the block sooner or later. Since the global mempool now exists, it seems to me it would be easier to abandon prioritisation, rather than messing with your settings every other month for the sake of an unnecessary memory management issue.
I'm not unaware that this is a politically contentious issue and any post here may be my last. I've chosen a niche and contentious currency, use a a niche and contentious client with niche and contentious settings. Some may compare me to a spam relay and I have given it some thought but there are some key differences:
 * spam email is potentially infinite while there are a finite number of satoshis and utxos
 * spam email is virtually free while low fee txs drain the spammers wealth 
 * I can identify spam email or run an algorithm that only affects my own false positives, not potentially block a poor person's access to Bitcoin
 * More people running open email relays worsens the problem of spam email, while once a few people are running a random drop policy more users only strengthen the global mempool.

Thanks for engaging me on the point and the unexpected upvotes. Happy BTTF day to all.


They will if they are configured to do so. The fact that people can do this means the network must be prepared to deal with the results. This patch is part of one larger set of views that treat this with increasingly complex rules in an effort to keep Bitcoin usable with small blocks. The alternative set of views accepts that random is better and embraces the larger blocks that that implies.


Parts of this patch are a small part of a larger fix being applied to a non-problem in my opinion.


Transactions still propagate, miners would have included them in blocks already if they had space. I have 80k transaction right now, I had 90k last week so someone is mining some of them (sure, some others would have been double-spends and been invalidated rather than written to disk).
I'd say we need both a global mempool for resilience against spam and larger block sizes so we can prevent expensive RAM storing these transactions and get them written to disk more quickly. That's why I run an alternative client.


Switching to a fixed mempool size appropriate for your node and dropping random transactions fixes this. It's madness to me that anyone other than miners should be needing to worry about fees. A core function of a node is to relay transactions. Fees should be between users and miners. The global mempool is not going away, it needs to be faced.


Until they get included in a block, then they are downloaded to disk and verified, bypassing the already-full mempool. This patch though is not about preventing relay loops, it's about mempool micro-management. There's no bandwidth problem, the problem is not in the propagation, the problem is the mempool is too large because the max block size is too small.


You're not using the air or lines as a buffer, you're using the fact that you'll be in at least a significant percentage of nodes at any one time.


So let's get them written to disk then. It's no coincidence that [REDACTED] client has the feature set that it does, they are linked in that the simpler mempool management implies larger blocks sooner (since low fee transactions don't now just vanish) and the simpler relaying of double-spends complements that versus the more complex RBF etc.
**TL;DR: It's impossible to look at max block size, mempool eviction policy and double-spend policies individually, only collectively.**

Using the bitaddress bit of html/javascript on a:
 * Online machine:
   * Lots of attack surface from other software on the machine
   * Keys can be sent/spent by malware instantly
   * All the vectors of the next two
 * Machine that has been online:
   * Could be persistent malware on disk or firmware
   * Malware could undermine your RNG
   * Malware could swap bitcoin addresses in the copy buffer
   * Malware could violate the air gap by audio
 * Machine running on tor:
   * Man in the middle attacks for http sites at exit nodes if you get your bitaddress html from there
   * Hints that bitcoin usage over tor can deanonymise your tor session
   * What operations are you using tor to perform? Full node would be bad, spv client would leave the SPV server with your fingerprint as well as the deanon above, offline operations should be done on your offline computer, publishing a transaction would make some sense.
 * Machine that will later go online:
   * Malware could grab printer memory containing private keys you printed offline
   * Malware could find temp files from certain wallets (browser cache for example)
 * Machine that has never been and will never go online:
   * Machine has a vulnerable RNG
   * Machine comes installed with malware
To get around the last two vectors you buy a random, new, cheap laptop from a big store, blat it with a trusted OS, keep it offline and roll dice to get your entropy.

All valid points. I've read (and mostly understood) the tor devs response to the attacks of last year and took from it some comforts regarding false positives and negatives as the attack scales.
I don't doubt they're deep into it but I'd like to think they can get 30% rather than 90%. But that's theoretical. With weak implementations of nodes (especially putting them on vps) it does start to look scary.

In attempting to build a reversible payment system on top of an irreversible payment system you are taking on risk. By removing the Pavlovian response from your users you are encouraging them not to learn from their mistakes. This transfers more risk to you as you grow.

It doesn't solve the Byzantine Generals problem theoretically, it seems to solve it practically - good enough for these purposes. It is similar to hash cash which came before it which was(is?) used to prevent email spam.
Satoshi's genius was putting the various concepts together, recognising the idea's time had come, choosing the magic numbers, starting a new p2p network and the work he did with individuals to get the economy going.
It amazes me that he thought it could work (given the state of people, not software) and that he could make it work - if I was Satohi I wouldn't feel confident unless I had enormous resources to counter a small percentage of the obstacles I could foresee.
On the other hand, making it open, fair and the first/biggest would be the best incentive for adoption. If that can't work for at least the crypto mailing list and their friends then clearly the world doesn't want fair.

I'm convinced there are dark mining pools about to come online and steal way more than 50%, especially since yifu is involved. Can we add a pgp web of trust to the existing hash power? So you have to know a miner to join as a miner? With some growth restrictions.
I think we need to do this very urgently.
If this web is built from the keys from the addresses of the coinbase of mined coins so far then we should exclude satoshis millions just in case he is the nsa.

From your link:
-receive a scanned copy of the actual deposit slip used during the deposit transaction.
-receive a scanned copy of the business card of the bank employee who accepted the deposit who can be contacted to verify the deposit.
random comments from forum users:
 * site is not even https secured?
 * its a good idea, but localbitcoins.com is much larger and more popular and many sellers offer direct bank transfers as well
 * Any reason why your asking for home addresses?Also think you need to be registered with FINCEN or something like that.Think that's the main reason fc4b.com is MIA.
I'm surprised you linked to that thread. Is that the best feedback you've had that you can point to?
My take:
This method is not anonymous, has higher fees, more manual processes, work and risk on part of the buyer and seller than others. The site owner does not appear to have or have bought solid IT skills. Good luck though, bicoin-brokers!

Also note that if your wallet has received many microtransactions, when you go to spend them the message size can become so large that there is a significant fee required. Someone recently had a 90% fee to try and spend ~0.1 BTC because of this.
The answer is to do coin control properly. Something like: send 0.01 to the account, then using coin control send that plus a few the contents of a few other microtrasaction addresses to a new address. The new address now only has one input. Rinse and repeat.
I've not tried this yet but will need to look into it as I'm trying to get a large charity to take BTC now.

Having considered these and other points about altcoins carefully (before this post) I have concluded that they are necessary. Governments could attempt an arms race for sha hashing power.
Having another coin that they would have to destroy to fully eliminate the possibility of digital currencies taking over, especially one that would require a different set of hardware and attacking more distributed (and differently located) miners, strengthens Bitcoin from this attack, either by making it less likely or by offering a new start if it happens.

Within the same country? How bad are the banks there? Online payments here in the UK are usually instant and reversals are rare things as far as I know. Rare like getting your account frozen, that kind of ball park. And both parties still risk that.
I think the main problem I have with your model is that you're misrepresenting it. It is not innovative, it is an coin escrow service and meeting place.
On the escrow front your site does not instil confidence that this is a well-designed and well-tested code-base so there can be no trust in the service.
Especially when you compare this to the quality and price of service BTCrow and others can offer.
On the meeting-place front, you have said that you don't believe a reputation-system has any value so there's little chance of trust developing there between buyers and sellers over time. The buyer and seller do all the work and take all the risk and you take a cut for inserting yourself between them. You hadn't looked properly at your competition as you didn't realise they offer OTC, online payments and IRL options for buyers and sellers to choose from and have a really efficient, well-designed and well-implemented system.
I also don't think you give enough (any?) control to the buyer or seller in setting a price and I don't see how you have proven that you are being transparent in giving the buyer and seller the same proof of the price.
Finally, if all you have is bank account details and a bitcoin address, how are you going to deal with the buyer reversing the transaction. Are you going to phone their bank and get their address and sue them or hunt them down or what?
I wouldn't buy Bitcoin with PayPal but some people do and it works for them. I wish you the best of luck in your venture, I hope you find a market and turn them into satisfied customers.

Without the private key they can only verify. Only the private key can sign new transactions.
Thinking of the children (hopefully those above the age of consent) or others in this situation (adulterers?), they can use a brainwallet passphrase and install/uninstall the app when they want to update/verify their address.
The verification service would collate certificates from the clinics and keep them available and up to date and associated with their function. Signatures from the clinic could then be easily verified by the app.
The verification service can also verify the user separately through a variety of means, (age, name, marital status) ultimately determined by what the users of the system demand.
Maybe someone else could offer reputation and escrow services tied to this type of verification service to help the legitimate sex trade.

I think the difference of the wealth of early adopters is that unlike those who own or control the supply of large amounts of dollars, they need to invest it wisely to stay in that position.
In the legacy economy the monopoly on banking extorts a high tax on transactions. Miners can't force exorbitant transaction fees as there will always be some money to be made by some miners accepting lower fees so the market will find a fair rate.
The other thing I see affecting the way wealth is distributed comes from the public nature of transactions. Companies will likely be forced to declare the addresses they own. Assuming 10% of companies are honest about this, the governments will be able to find other addresses belonging to $DISHONEST_COMPANY that relate to transactions with $HONEST_COMAPNY and so the dishonest companies can be found and penalised. Once this happens people can see transparently how companies manage their affairs and fair comment and informed investing can be made, including based on ethics of wealth distribution.
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer!

Very true. People with STDs shouldn't think "I have x so I'm safe with other people with x". You then have two subtly different forms, especially in the case of HIV.
A false sense of security and the public not understanding probability strikes at the heart of the idea. If condoms were effectively used though we wouldn't still have such growing problems. It seems even with that safe sex message people are still putting themselves at risk.
The "instant confirmation" of a past partner just receiving a positive result affecting your score is not that instant, likely of the order of weeks to months.

I get: Ooops.... This page doesn't exist. Thank goodness the Internet can remember, even statistics quoted without sources:
While nearly a third of Britons questioned in a poll said they had heard of Bitcoin, many of those who are aware of it (38%) think it will be the currency of the future.
In the first ever major consumer survey of attitudes towards Bitcoin and digital currency, seven out of 10 Brits (69%) who had heard of Bitcoin said that they trusted Bitcoin, with 14% saying they trusted it more than the pound sterling.
Research conducted by On Device Research in association with st-art, the organisers of the forthcoming Bitcoin London conference ( also found high levels of confidence in Bitcoin in the US and Argentina, the two other territories where the research was conducted.
In Argentina, where Bitcoin awareness is higher than in the UK or US, 73% of those who'd heard of Bitcoin trusted it, with 22% having more confidence in Bitcoin over the peso. 62% of Bitcoin-aware Americans trusted the digital currency, with 16% having more trust in it than the dollar.
Other key findings of the report include:
-Nearly a third (32.2%) of Britons had heard of Bitcoin, compared to a quarter of Americans
-16% of Bitcoin-aware Americans trust Bitcoin more than the dollar
-44% of Bitcoin-aware Argentinians find Bitcoin appealing as it means they don't have to deal with financial institutions
More data from the research can be found below.
"Confidence and awareness of Bitcoin and digital currency is growing fast as perceptions of traditional currency have been hit hard by the recent financial crisis," said Pamir Gelenbe, founder of st-art and Hummingbird Ventures Venture Partner.
"While negative perceptions of the national currency and high levels of confidence in Bitcoin might not come as such a surprise in Argentina, the data from the UK and US is more striking - with high levels of awareness and a strong feeling that digital currencies are the future.
"Digital currency also represents a significant opportunity to help the four billion people on this planet that don't have bank accounts - Bitcoin makes it possible to hold money on a phone or PC and transfer money seamlessly from anywhere to anywhere in a split second, without expensive wire transfer fees.
"Over time, these 'unbanked' consumers around the world will adopt Bitcoin - just like they have adopted mobile phones - and use it to store and transfer their money," he continued.
Bitcoin London will take place on 2 July in the heart of London's financial district, with Bitcoin investors, entrepreneurs and evangelists under one roof for the first time in the UK's capital city. Speakers at the event will include Spotify advisor and investor Shakil Khan.
"We're delighted to have such a high-profile list of attendees for the first major Bitcoin summit to take place in London," Gelenbe said. "Many Bitcoin startups are beginning to see significant traction and an event like this can really help to steer the the future of the Bitcoin ecosystem, with ideas, insights and opportunities from key players in this space being shared openly."

So meet in a public place appropriate to the amount and either wait for a confirmation or use a client like a blockchain account that can spot doublespends.
If there's no doublespend in 20 or 30 seconds it is very unlikey that one could slip in ahead of your unconfirmed transaction.  If its more than a few btc you would wait longer obviously.

An few episodes of the apprentice where the teams are paired with a bitcoin expert (to answer questions only) and given 1BTC.  Whoever comes back with the most after a week or two wins. Ah, grenathius already suggested this.
A Dragon's Den episode where the usual panel is replaced with Bitcoin angels. Film it as part of an extra day at the next big Bitcoin conference on your continent.
Also, the suggestion Just2AddMy2Cents made, maybe with a back to the future-style, two or more different future timelines.
Look to shows like the Keiser report or madbitcoins.com to see that there is enough content to fill half an hour a day of interesting content aimed at a higher level. Avoid slipping into every 'in-depth' 3 minute article introducing it like everyone's a noob every time by making some 5 minute VT explaining the basics and giving links to further research and run it a few times a day.
Last one, combine the apprentice idea with the charities idea and see who can do the most good with their 1BTC.

So lets say you neighbour monitors your bluetooth. They can see the transactions you're passing to the trezor to sign. They get themselves a similar-looking address and spoof the amount to be 10-100 times as much one day when you're getting some savings out.
You've done this half a dozen times before so now you press the button instinctively and bam! savings gone. Or just spam you constantly and hope you press the button accidentally while putting it away.
Yes, you should be checking the address and amount carefully and yes you could still have this attack from a compromised machine via USB but why buy a device to minimise your attack surface and then buy another one to widen it?
Also, there's another battery to change.
Seriously, I don't see the value of this product. Considering you might plug it in once a month when juggling your money around is plugging in a USB device so difficult? Would you not have to plug your trezor into your device anyway? Do you have wireless charging for all your devices?

Genius idea. It would be NCP that would benefit most from this though.
I would be a bit worried about the amount of coin they could hoard given they have either paid their land investments off or probably finish doing so with the long tail of their fiat income, their product is essentially free for them, they have lot of it and they can command a premium.
Most big business support that would clearly benefit the Bitcoin economy has many other people involved that would get paid along the way. It might be nice to start with that company that lets Londoners rent their drive. It's more peer-to-peer.
All that said, NCP profits are not much use to them if they don't spend them at some point. If they had floated this would be a nice way to re-distribute but they are limited and surely raking it in. Anyone know if most parking in the world is owned by private individuals/companies?

Why do I need to justify mining effort if I include a fee in the transaction? If I pay for a clinic checkup I expect almost the same transaction to happen as far as Bitcoin is concerned. Are you upset about the idea of multisigs? You didn't answer me before about that.
None of the clinics, the app providers (note plural) and the users are a central authority. Yes, we make trust decisions every day


OK, you've made yourself very clear.
Charging more is fine if there is competition but not if there is a central authority imposed.
The idea of a blockchain (even if it's not the Bitcoin blockchain) *is* a good solution to how to distribute such data.

That's what I'm talking about. Company restructured and I can take a huge hit in taking it in cash or have to put it in a fiat pension plan. I'm cool with that choice but I'm wondering when a pension firm will give me that option.
I mean, I'm only asking them to hold a piece of paper for a few decades, I don't want them to do any work or take any risk. Just wave whatever magic wand to make the big number become BTC and not the little number! Also I'm only talking about the pension contribution for this short period where they've suddenly given me the option, I'm not betting the farm. Not that I have a farm.
As for replacing GBP, I was exaggerating sorry. If the world reserve wasn't any particular country's currency then all the others wouldn't have such large problems. Although if the market cap was a significant percentage of trade then wouldn't banks go into an un-profitable spiral?

Calculations I did last week showed me ~6 GH/s ASIC miner returns ~0.18 BTC/day less pool fees. Runnng at 50 W it is more than paying for electricity and could pay off the few hundred investment for the kit in a couple of months.
Can I ask how much hashing power you have and your power consumption? What pool are you in?
If everyone takes a punt on just a little ASIC then the risk and reward are spread more evenly. If it doesn't quite work out economically this iteration then no person has lost too much, but ther BTC will have gained anyway hopefully. If it's a good iteration for miners then the rewards are less concentrated.

I think you just did.
One reason Bitcoin has succeeded is that it is logical, it makes sense. Rational People can understand and explain it. Some random ponzi scheme will not succeed because the Rational People can see through it so they don't recommend it and it can't take hold.
Hopefully there will be clients that Rational People can recommned to our friends that warn them off the merchant telling them that such a transaction will devalue their remaining Bitcoin savings and future earnings.
That takes care of the merchants and customers. The next attack will be taking over the hash rate. Perhaps there could be some safeguards put in place that the current miners would be wise to deploy to avoid to sudden a change in network configuration or force noob limits until they had been fully verified as non-govenmental or non filtering miners?

So I selected buy 15x10$ of coins and sell 15x$10 of coins and now the cart is asking me to deposit $300, is that right? You have a selection of banks but only take USD, why not just have one or two? I'm guessing it's too far between branches of any particular bank in America?
Is this designed for anonymous cash transactions and that's why I wouldn't want to just deposit using online banking (which would go through straight away with no fee)? When mtgox(was it?) had an account at Barclays with which you could do counter deposits but the stopped this as it wasn't a dedicated business banking service, was costing them too much to administer and was open to fraud. Have you been able to get assurances from the banks that you will be able to continue with this model as you scale up?
Does the seller get to decide when to sell at mtgox prices then, as well as the buyer picking up the 2% fee? What level of automation do you have to consolidate the fiat and distribute the Bitcoin? Have you spoken to BTCGlobal and are you registered/registering as a money transmitter?

I'm thinking you could have multiple accounts with different network providers (including the upcoming wifi/mesh projects) and use the micro-payment feature that is under development. Not sure how they're getting round the race attack with that one.
That keeps transactions for every call down to off-chain transactions. You can still use the bitcoin addresses relating to the transactions as identifiers. I'd imagine that it could work well if done right, good luck!
@_date: 2013-07-14 12:40:39
Bruce Schnier has some scary stuff to say about spoofing of TCP checksums. Perhaps the only reason why exploited machines are not used more is that it would expose the level of exploitation. Think South Korea a while ago, forty-odd thousand computers across 5 companies bricked overnight. How many more could they have done if they wanted?
Stealing Bitcoin keys as part of regular pwnage and waiting for a reasonable amount of money being at the address before exposing the exploitation. If you can tell it's plausible that the keys could have been stolen elsewhere you can steal the BTC without necessarily expose the exploitation.
If you're being paranoid:
 * Offline Linux (or better still OpenBSD perhaps) computer
 * Good source of entropy
 * Use QR codes to pass in and out unsigned/signed transactions
 * Use your online computer to put the signed transaction on the network, via a tails/tor/vpn solution depending on how tight your tinfoil hat is.
I like to think of it like this though: most leet-crackers-turned-Bitcoin-thieves are on a path of diminishing returns. They have already stolen big amounts and will have to work harder for ever smaller amounts as time goes by.
Meanwhile, they would be worried to spend some of their big hoards for fear of reprisal and with new taint tools coming even small thefts could be realistically investigated by authorities, identifying and prosecuting the thief without causing the unwitting buyer to be out of pocket by actually tainting their Bitcoin.

Use the blockchain.info API to get the payments made to your address. You don't need to generate a new address for each donation.
Generating new addresses for each transaction lets *you* be more anonymous (not really needed when accepting donations on your site) or to identify specific transactions in the flood of transactions (think point of sale device at the pound shop - lots of £1, £2 transactions).
Hmm, the BTC equivalent of the poundshop would be the complete opposite - everyday more and more expensive things in there instead of a race to the bottom.

I wish it could work, a voluntary rating system so that customers can be informed of the security of the processes controlling their funds, like an AA rating or Michelin Stars but I think it could end up as corrupt and ineffective as some of the existing rating systems.
I've heard of a company that prevents cars parking on gravel when the ISOxxxxx inspectors come round to get the certificate but then let them park there again once they've left. This sort of attitude to a wallet service would be fatal quickly.
The most important part of the process is the security of your IT systems and the strengths of your application. Key aspects that Bitcoin business will need to think about above your average site include a good understanding of randomness, PKI, OS hardening, anti-DDOS, a good development process with thorough testing. All these things need to be done well or that AAA rating drops right down to a F.
It could be a good idea to create a shared table of concerns that either pure BTC or with-fiat projects could look at to make sure they consider each concern and implement in their own way from the start. They can volunteer information on how they address them and maybe inviting an auditor in to check that it appears that you're doing that is another item on the list by which you can be judged.

If the former then you don't need gox. Sign up with Bitstamp and do a SEPA transfer from your bank to theirs in Slovenia. Bank charges for a few hundred should be less than £20, though I don't know if that goes up for larger amounts.

It is proposed to increase it. The limit was to prevent spam in the blockchain.


Running a full node using multibit or bitcoin-qt is good for the network. Hard disk capacity grows faster than the blockchain, even with more transactions, providing pruning is done.


It takes 10-20 seconds to be sure there is not another transaction on the network trying to spend those coins (where only one would win). After that you would have to have a lot of hashing power and be doing a very high value transaction with no recourse for this to be a problem.


Depends on what you define as illegal operations. Also, localbitcoins.com and OTR purchases.


More interesting stuff is bitcoin contracts and smart property. Also, there is a checksum in a bitcoin address. You won't likely make a typo and hit a valid address.


You will be able to borrow bitcoins in the future. Although it would be terrible to avoid fiat debts, the current system asks for more interest than money in existence, so it would be impossible for everyone to take such a moral stance.


With an asset based economy you don't start out in debt. Don't borrow coins and that won't be a problem.


Making a transaction on the blockchain is an expense for miners. Efforts to bundle transactions when designing systems is a therefore a benefit. Also see the coming micropayment system. Facebook-tx, the bitcointip bot and all the exchanges already do this.
@_date: 2013-06-21 20:45:57
Others have nailed the obvious flaws here but just one more thing, by double-spend, what is meant is actually multiple-spend. If you can maintain enough hashing power to fake enough blocks it doesn't really matter what the transactions are as long as you have some coins to sign away when you start doing it. You could send the same 1BTC to a thousand people if you wanted during a 51% attack.

OK, perhaps a contrived example but if there are two pieces of knowledge, A and B and knowing neither meant no reward, knowing A alone causes a loss but knowing A and B causes a reward.

The governments, who are the lender of last resort when the [run] ( on the banks [happens] ( are getting sick of it too. Do you think the government *wants* to lend the banks money and then have to borrow it back at a higher rate? Sounds like they're getting well and truly bent over.
IMHO, people would be better off with a tiny amount of credit rather than an enormous amount of debt but the current system cannot exist if everyone paid off all their debt. There is not enough money in the world for everyone to pay back what they owe. The game is rigged from the start.
I'm all for banks taking long-term savings and lending it wisely to make a profit and interest for the kind people who gave them their money to look after. That's honest banking. Maybe if the banks had accepted a small bust when that model reached its limit instead of pushing it as far as they could we could have stayed with a stable fractional-reserve system.
Heck, if they'd have started lending more recently when the government told them to they could have got out of it (see the khanacademy videos) but they were screwing each other on the LIBOR so why would they take the risk and responsibility of kick-starting the economy again.
**tl;dr: The banks were the first to lose faith in their own system, we can't blame the governments as they don't have a real choice in the matter.**

Anyone know about the UK situation?
I have a bit of money that needs to be paid into a pension as if I take it in cash I lose 70% of it through tax and losing the employers contributions.
How can I get that value locked to BTC rather than GBP that will be worthless when I'm 65 (or 70 or whatever they put the retirement age up to by then)?
I'd love to be able to put the whole thing in BTC and say to the government: "check the blockchain - if I spend it before I'm 65 then I'll pay the tax, otherwise, STFU!"

Those with a large number of coins can't do stuff on this scale efficiently yet. It's hard but disasters happen all the time and the choice is to fix this one or ten or a hundred (or better, establishing a self-sustaining relief operation) in the future when the price can support it.
Any attempt to try and help with Bitcoin now won't be as effective as we know it will be once it is ubiquitous. Half their infrastructure is likely down and it's not the time to be teaching people to use wallets.
I've know idea how stable the country was before this disaster - was the political or economic situation fragile before? Were the people already looking for a fix? Is the finance sector still working (savings, insurance) And is the GDP of the region considerably larger than the BTC market cap? If so Bitcoin can't help here much. There could be a few calls for help on here from embedded bitcoiners that could be answered.
Also, it could look like we're trying to cash in on publicity.
Edit: meant to say the things they need will likely be bought with dollars or pledged and millions are already flowing on the fiat side. We need to fix BTC charities to avoid scams while there's not a crisis going on. If only the various players in international disaster relief could get along.

The first place photonics was supposed to be heading was backbone routers. Is the hashing protocol simpler than a full-blown router in photonics? I've no idea but I'd guess so. If it was it could perhaps test some of their ideas.
The efficiency and hashing density would be insane. 1 nm is about 100 atoms, a few more developments after that and we would be getting into the ball-park of thermodynamic limits.

None of what the OP asks is about fiat. I think the OP is enlightened enough to want to keep his hard-earned coins. In which case you can start really quickly with any regular wallet with a static Bitcoin address and print off the QR code for that. To verify you can just have the address open in blockchain on a device by the till.
The clever bits are getting a new address for each transaction and creating the QR code on the fly. The bitcoind program can generate new addresses for you though you need to know how to poke it with RPC commands from your POS. Getting exchange rates should be straightforward, plenty of sites have APIs for you to use.
You should be able to do this without agreeing to hand over a percentage of your takings, too. bitpay take 0.5% for converting to fiat while bitmerch seem to charge the same just to forward it to another address.

True, this is a bad thing, anyone got some good links about Bitcoin doxing? Whatever other mechanism could do this would have to share something with the other individual and they could then post that online. If the clinic acts as a mixing service and the token is never spent except to redeem (when you're bored of free love) your token amount through another clinic.
Topping up that address could be a new token from the clinic or maybe the size of your STD address becomes some sort of fertility symbol, peacock feather or notch on the bedpost! If someone finds out you've bought your STD medication or vibrating love eggs they could hold that over you, too.


I accept it's not needed but its size and distributed nature offer advantages in security. The core dev team are interested in having the right thing being built on top of Bitcoin, not that I'm saying this is the right thing but it's fun to think about them.
Given how many addresses are created for sending and receiving transactions by the average person using Bitcoin normally, the fact that you have one more address that happens to have a few extra certificates on a transaction, is that really any more bloat than having a transaction with a few more inputs? I genuinely don't know.
Thanks for the input.

Bitcoin has its own URI scheme so I think you can set up your web server to redirect  to bitcoin://1MyReallyCoolAddress1yty?label=mysite and let your browser's helper open your wallet for you and initiate a payment (pending your confirmation of course).

@_date: 2013-07-07 11:50:40
Maybe what the idea needs above your typical site is a web of trust and reputation system to prove that you have one account, rather than some spare clean ones. The gpg etc. webs of trust didn't achieve widespread adoption as they were tech-specific.
With x509 certs coming to Bitcoin clients we are only a few steps away from a web of trust on top of Bitcoin, one that relates to money that everybody uses (heh, in my dreams). When you're playing poker with (even just a little) real money instead of free chips you get real involvement from players.
This is why I think the web of trust that evolves on top of Bitcoin will be the one that will be used for the most official and important things.
I can't imagine setting up and maintaining the world-wide infrastructure needed to do this the traditional way. I thought this would be a simple way to start offering the infrastructure to the clinics and given that it was just one, slightly non-standard transaction every few months for only part of the population I didn't think it would be that bloatful, but I was wrong!
Thanks for taking the time to convince me. I've learned a lot.

So let's say BP are known to be taking BTC for fuel. They could be forced by government to declare their addresses otherwise the government would have to estimate their income in BTC and levy this high guestimate on their fiat accounts.
If they only declare some of the addresses and try to trade BTC with another company that declares their addresses and the addresses they trade with, the government could look at the blockchain and would be able to see the undeclared activity.
With a significant percentage of honest businesses they could accurately estimate the size of this undeclared income and so guestimate better before slapping a fine on top.

We're not talking about proving that someone else generated the same key, we're taking about proving that when you transferred the money to another account, that you own that other account. This proof has nothing to do with maths and has more to do with the plausibility of the specific situation in court.
So let's say I have 10,000 BTC in an account that can easily be associated with me due to AML at the exchanges. I transfer this to another account. If I'm asked, I say that I bought a pizza with it and ate it. Now the burden of proof is on the prosecution that I didn't buy a pizza and that I still have access to the funds in the new account.

That's my favourite line from this drivel.
This "International Cyber Security Protection Alliance" is a tiny, misguided self-interest group in Buckinghamshire, UK that the government is not likely to listen to. Even if it does listen to it, they are not saying anything the government wouldn't be thinking anyway.
What they are actually calling for is a regulated exchange at both ends, which we have. They just don't get that exchanges are only temporary until Bitcoin is the main unit of account. Then if anyone is still interested in fiat and haven't taken up the government's national crypto-currency that is pegged to Bitcoin we can have the exchanges demand AML/KYC regs of the fiat-lovers to know where their dirty cash comes from before letting it pollute our blockchain.
I imagine the payment to register will be large and denominated in BTC. Perhaps they will never be able to afford it without already owning lots of BTC. Hmm, now what does that remind me of?

Testing for a pattern in the private/public key as well as the address is above what vanity address generators do. All addresses and keys are roughly the same length.

The two key features of Bitcoin that elevate it above all others are the amount of work in the chain and the fact that it is so efficient compared to the legacy infrastructure. Nothing with a hint of legacy/centralised thinking can come close and will inflate in comparison because of this alone.


*OT* is perfect for these people to peg their currencies against *BTC*. Why they would want to is beyond me though, for trinkets inside the walled-gardens? Sure, have a database of facebook credits or whatever and *promise* you're not going to inflate them or take them or withhold them. The only reason companies aren't using real money for online micropayments now is because the fees.
This is not revolutionary though. It's just what IT people do and, due to layers of management and competition instead of co-operation, are usually forced to do it inefficiently. It would make more sense for *countries* to use OT/Coloured coins and have monetary controls over their own fiat but no-one else's.
Litecoin deserves respect for showcasing what can easily be done differently. *Something* else is needed for micro-payments in order for Bitcoin to scale the way it will. It *must* be pegged to BTC somehow; by merged-mining/coloured coins or a OT stake.
The key things that have value, to me, are a fixed supply, a distributed nature and the binding nature of a payment (and contracts and...). Ripple is the opposite on every count.
Why should Google or even proprietary businesses use Ripple when they can use GCoins that are pegged to an exact number of BTC? They have their brand and stability of BTC (hah!) without creating a new PayPal.
**tfl;dr**: BTC=Win!, LTC=almost BFF with BTC, Ripple=IOU, funny money.
Edit: I think I did Litecoin an injustice there. It's cash for the masses (Yay!) and and a life-boat for Bitcoin and  I'm sure not that all *that* easy to implement.

freelancers.com would benefit from some transparency. It seems it's all being done through PMs and this loses some of the value of the network above craigslist.
I would much prefer it if each project was discussed in abstract in public and bids had a public price with a summary of the implementation. Most of projects I see look like they have either been underbid or the buyer will have been misled about what they are getting.
There is a $50, $500 and $5000 solution to just about any problem and without seeing the details it's not possible to bid sensibly so you get a PM thread explaining the idea which probably differs in requirements form another bidder's PM thread.

Bitstamp have a Slovenian account that can be funded from most UK bank accounts by doing an international SEPA transfer. For ~£100 or so the fee has been &lt;£20 which I've generally made back in a week or two as the price has risen. I don't know about bank fees for larger amounts or how bitstamp's prices differ from gox's but bitstamp's fees seem very low.
Once you've bought BTC you can transfer them to a mtgox account for day trading and I don't think you even need to wait be verified by gox unless/until you wanted to withdraw the fiat from there, though I may be wrong on that.

One practical reason would be to allow reconciliation for transactions. If 0.01BTC was a common transaction and you've taken 10 in a minute how do you know which customer just had no money at there address and just attempted a double-spend. Since you don't know all the customer's addresses you can't reconcile using that.

I think you may be forgetting about some of the self-correcting factors. Block rewareds halve every 210000 blocks, not every 4 years. The rate of block discovery self-corrects towards 10 minutes so you can't extrapolate from periods like now when the block discovery rate is being pulled down to 6 minutes due to asic miners.
Do your calculations again in a day or so after the next correction and see if they still hold.

But with a different app it is never a problem in the first place.


Which is why I'm soliciting alternative suggestions. You speak of blockchain bloat but how do you expect the blockchain to be used? By ordinary people for ordinary transactions? Because then you'd only have one tx per x thousand that related to your sexual health. Involved in those transactions is the payment to the clinic and the ability for you to move this back to a normal address or spend it. What is you specific concern about blockchain bloat? The multisigs?


I would consider someone who could demonstrate a clean history to be more trustworthy than someone with a history of 2 check-ups (depending on their age of course). My health is more valuable to me than my wealth and I wouldn't place any trust in a system that didn't try hard to protect against fraud, hence thinking about using the security of a popular blockchain.


Think more in terms of smart property than transactions. You only prove you own the address, you don't spend money every time you have sex. Well, some people do but that's a different thread.

There's crypo-anarchist's FAQ from '92 that has a summary of the things on the mind of that community at the time and it mentions crypto-currencies along with a lot of other stuff, though I can't vouch for its authenticity.
The amount of work that went into both it and its deployment suggests a team effort to me. Whether it was one one man, crypto-anarchists or non-US governments it doesn't matter. They all wanted it, this is the only challenger that has ever stood a chance to change the status quo and if it were to fail it won't be possible to mount a similar offensive in our lifetimes.
It is what it is and everyone has the same knowledge and opportunities. Anyone fearing moving large amounts of ill-gotten gains will seek out someone who knows Bitcoin and increase their anonymity.

The tech for sign language has languished in academia for too long. There are too many projects that were started with terrible software and videos that are nowhere near finished.
The regional variations even within BSL are so stark and interesting I'm sure there would be much discussion over the etymology and proper use. The videos wouldn't take up much storage at all and they can be updated as fashions change.

Hello, batshit-crazy here, reporting in. **tl;dr: I don't know.**

In one video from the San Jose conference about the future of Bitcoin the developers talk about the directions it could take. What I've said in that thread was first said by them and in my mind it is not inconceivable. There are only two options - the moon or bust, with all the implications for the future that outcome brings.
As for the trend in upvotes, I've not been redditing long enough to comment. I joined for for understanding and then front-row seats and have not been disappointed. Are other subreddits as exciting? 
I read hot exhaust(ive|ing)ly and dip into new when I can. Maybe upvotes should be more specific - slashdot has funny/insightful/interesting for example. Reddit must have solved this problem before? Ask the scientologists!

I like bitcoincharts.com and blockchain.info but I don't trade. Traders are more interested in mtgox prices but they probably look at many other sources before committing any large amount.
Google on the other hand has to give a fair price that you can use regardless of your activities. If they only gave the mtgox price they would be accused of ignoring better value for their users. If they ignored mtgox they would be accused of the same. If they were to make an index based on the weightings of various sources they could be accused of manipulating the price.

A well written vanity generator (I've never used one) would spend much more time making candidate key pairs and addresses than checking what amounts to a number of short and straightforward regexes. The checking side of things should scale fairly well. The program will be bound on CPU or entropy.
You're right, you could imagine a badly written vanity generator or totally abuse the pattern engine on an under-clocked raspberry PI, though the key generation code would likely slide the same way on the quality scale to restore the balance.
Edit: To be clear, I'm not slagging off all vanity generators, just saying I've never used them.

Why would you want a high-entropy pattern in a vanity address? I suppose you could encode a message in it. Unless you mean a short private key?
A regex can look for a lot of combinations at the same time in a very memory- and processor-efficient way. The can be built up in smaller parts and can use look-ahead and look-behind features. They can be compiled like a pair of special glasses and as the data streams by the matches pop out.
You can only do this pattern matching after creating the key pairs and hashing the public keys endlessly, to produce the Bitcoin addresses which is both the computationally expensive part of the process as well as my original point. 
Now awaiting flaming for praising regexes too highly.

We could, but many couldn't if it's not available in a GUI client or web wallet. And then we end up with a gazillion implementations, most of which will not be robust and easily maintainable. My attempts to get gnucash working with easymoney with some sort of real-time, automated, synchronisation with my bank failed miserably.
I suppose this is a big difference between a wallet and a current account; for most people STOs and DDs are the cornerstone of managing their money. I see this as an obvious product that should exist round about now in the adoption phase.
If I knew nobody else was about to launch something I'd throw some serious effort into it. There's lots of scope for Bitcoin-specific thinking in the feature set. I might start with [ledger]( for my personal stuff for now though.

Bought ~£120 worth of BTC using BitStamp. Despite my bank (Metrobank) charging £17.50 to do the transfer to BitStamp's (Slovenian?) account, the money was available to buy BTC with the very next day, less than 24 hours, and BitStamps fees were practically non-existant.
I was lucky enough to buy-in during the drop on 7th May so within 7 days the bank's transfer fee was essentially re-imbursed :)
I've been trying to get coin since Feb I was just missing every option by days/hours (Barclays counter deposits, Pingit, Transferwise), even localbitcoins in my area had just two people, one of whom didn't get back to my text and the other had not long cashed-out.

Let's say your malicious wallet app tries to double spend. Let's also assume that they put the two transactions on the network at different sides of the world at almost the same time.
Now, for a well-connected receiver, within 10-15 seconds it is clear which transaction will be accepted by the network and which one will be a double spend. Saatoshi's idea, not mine.
@_date: 2013-07-07 12:50:59
Bad analogy perhaps but I'd say that the current system of tests of individuals is more akin to confirmed transactions whereas tracking the verifications between accounts and updating your risk status based on the new test results of others is more like checking for double-spends with unconfirmed transactions.
The clinics already try to do some mapping but they are constrained by the lack of perfect knowledge of the complete network and the relatively poor tools available for them to analyse the data. They do a great job with what they have but if they managed to encouraged people to use such a system what could they achieve and what effect could that have on society?


Yeah, perfection is not a realistic goal but I do think there would be a network effect if it were reliable enough to gave some value to some people, and then you might tend towards perfection, especially with an incentive to increase testing rates for a period once adoption was widespread.

I'm a science/software guy and a humanist, not an economist, so forgive me if my framework is different to yours.
Bitcoin has a predictable, inflationary money supply. The deflationary aspect you see is an effect of the adoption from [weaker currencies] (
Bitcoin inflation is running at 10% but we know it's going to fall rapidly in steps in the long term. The big fiat currencies might be approaching that (can we ever believe their 2% figures?) and everything points to this rising further in the future. So which is the stronger currency?
This is something you already model you should be able to figure it out by adding Bitcoin as a country with a government whose monetary policy is known in advance and whose citizens are the early adopters. There is an open immigration policy, no laws that cannot be enforced mathematically and the running of the finance and administration system is as efficient in human labour as it is possible to be (~0% vs 40% of GDP).
Or model it like an ideal gold, a new metal that had all of gold's good properties but none of the inconveniences that prevent it from functioning as a deflationary currency (the coins become too small). There must be models already to show what happens if you let people have gold or the fed wouldn't have banned ownership or pegged the dollar to it.
The Mises Institute probably has more information you might like, you're a large part of their intended audience. They've put out some great videos of talks as well. One of my latest [favourites]( about the history of private coinage in Britain. Maybe also try and get some coursework from the Digital Currencies Masters that The University of Nicosia is offering. 
In the end, I don't think it is possible to model the period of chaotic change that is coming beyond the fact that we're going from a bad place that use these models to a better place that uses these other models. If anyone will be to blame for causing unfair distribution of wealth during these last few waves of adoption it is the mainstream media for misleading the public.
If I'm still evading the "how" then it is because I'm missing why there must be some requirement for deflation. From the wiki on deflation: Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). But we know that Bitcoin is inflationary and known to never go negative.
There is no deflation, merely a return of the value of labour to the people that produce it along with a reassignment of the investment capital to the smart, dedicated and random people.

I'm not searchable so I would have to add you. I have practically nothing on there and go on so rarely they've changed their site every time I do. I use it to pm a few friends to whom facebook is the Internet.
I did my worrying a long time ago and didn't sign up. Then, when I realised they could have shadow accounts of me anyway from what friends were saying about me I created an account to be able to pm and decided there was no point in worrying about things I can't control. I accept they get their value out of me by what my friends can be conned into saying about me in their 'quizzes' and I get to be able to pm these people when I absolutely need to.
The NSA wouldn't be interested in me. Would I not be more suspicious without a facebook account anyway? Do people who do dodgy things live their lives  off the grid or do they have normal happy profiles for the NSA to mine and then do the dodgy stuff on another computer, from another location, over tor or even in person depending on the dodgy thing.

That's a great idea! Almost like the double-spend protection.
But not a random dirty answer, the unknown could give a rating or more detail based on recent verification requests and the status of those requesting.
Imagine someone who is verified clean and only had sex with two clean people since then. They make moves on number 3 but one of those other two just failed a test so your risk rating goes up. Gutted! But effective.
I wonder how quickly we could get rid of STDs, or would we just stratify as a society and diverge as a species if this were to work?

I would like to see companies offer to spread the transfer fees across the various employees that want to receive Bitcoin. I would imagine there would be an option to say how much of your salary you wanted paying in Bitcoin.
As the price becomes more stable that percentage can be increased without extra work for the company beyond tweaking a value. The reverse also applies - the more of their salary people accept in Bitcoin, the more stable the price will become.

I thought there was. I know nothing about stock markets though.
There are a lot of early adopters with coins that cost them next to nothing. They could dump their coins on the market and drop the price, or just dribble them on to stabilise the price. While you're trying to maximise your USD day trading then there are people trying to maximise their BTC. 
If I was day trading with FSOJ I'd expect there to be a minimum cost of oranges that would be a significant part of the price of FSOJ. There is nobody in the FSOJ market that has lots oranges they got for free and wants to help generate a stable market for FSOJ so their oranges are still being traded in a few years.

This is a great summary of the events. I would like to add though that the quark pumping was a completely different style to the rest of his G/S/B stance. I didn't like the sound of it, he clearly lacked conviction.
I'd like to think this was a lesson in spotting a genuine coin versus a pump and dump. Before making a decision to invest or not you should consider the parameters behind it.
Max has been a great education to me these last few months. When something you hear fits into your framework of understanding and gels with the neighbouring concepts you can be fairly sure that's the way it is. Quark did not fit into the framework Max had been building in his audience if you ask me. The most important lesson is when not to add a barnacle to your clean framework of understanding.

I went like that for the first few weeks. It's caused by the dichotomy that you can see the potential it has to change every aspect of the world but people keep going about their daily lives as though nothing has changed.
Never before have people needed to understand, trust and invest in a revolution so quickly. Can I ask, do you have an IT background? People who do can relate to the tech and are thrilled at the programmability of money. Is that where you're coming from?
Edit: Then I went through the 'gotta get my bitcoin business idea out now, now, now!', then mining fever (got a hobby asic rig), then a dabble in localbitcoins, then seemingly fruitless evangalism and now helping colleagues get cash into coin. So don't expect it to slow down any time soon, or be go exactly where you think it's gonna go.

That's some good information right there, thanks. In particular I'd forgotten the two week period. I read somewhere though that the time between changing difficulty was likely to be changed if the rate of change of the hash rate changed enough.
But yeah, that would be a headache if people were able to obtain that sort of hashing power suddenly. At the moment at least (and for probably this reason) money can't buy such power.
I don't see how mining for a pool and not submitting results would help. Are the pools so dumb that they report the hash rate your client claims rather than calculating it from the proof of work you provide? 
I also doubt that managing to up the average block time to 12 minutes for two weeks would scare the non-technical people, plus the next difficulty would be determined by the average hash rate for the last two weeks, so if they turned them back on after that change, we'd have two weeks of 8 minute blocks, no? Given the variety in confirmation times at the moment it might be hard to notice!

I can offer you [this] ( about transaction fees being based on inputs but I did read (can't find the link now, sorry) that they were considering calculating transaction fees based on the rate of transactions at the time of spending.
This has the effect of spreading the fees out more fairly between both users and miners. Maybe that change was included in the multibit client. I don't have any coins in my multibit client so can't test this easily.
Can you tell us what version you're using please? Some people will get their client from their distribution's repos and there could be a delay before those versions are in there.

Like everyone else here I'm just trying to keep up with as much Bitcoin news as I can. Any effort you can spend building and presenting a case for this being a scam before posting is effort that many others don't have to do in parallel.
A few examples of bad service and people crying scam on facebook 4 or 5 years ago when dino were just starting out does not detract from the fact that millions of products are now available to buy with Bitcoin from "one of the biggest global online retailers" (that I'd never heard of before today).
Any business could be a scam and any transaction can go wrong. You have to make a trust decision before doing any transaction. Did you distrust the OP's link or did you distrust the dinodirect site? Or did you look at neither and just google 'dinodirect scam'?
Finally, this is not a stock or mining rig where big decisions need to be made fast, this is an established store with considerable recourse that has opened its doors to bitcoiners. Buy something at .1 and see if they deliver. Let them earn your trust.

Forget the calculators and think of it like this. Blockchain.info's [hast-rate]( chart tells you how many GH/s are in the wild. Most recent peak was around 140000 so if you have 5 you have 5 / 140000 = 0.000035714 (out of 1) of the hash rate.
The reward is 25 coins per block and there should be 144 blocks generated every 24 hours. So that's 144 * 25 = 3600. So all being fair, you should be seeing 3600 * 0.000035714 = 0.1285704 BTC per day.
I'm ignoring changes in hash rate (extrapolate the graph above yourself). Difficulty is irrelevant if you look at your total share of the reward but can give people putting large amount of hash rate benefits over others over a week or two.
I'm also ignoring the pool's revenues here though they should be well-known for each pool. How long would you have to run solo before winning a block reward? That should be the same as the average time it would take you to earn the value of the block reward which, all things staying the same, would be 25 / 0.1285704 = 194 days. For some people it will be longer, for others shorter. 
Any calculator doing more than that is guessing the rate of growth of the network. If we knew the shape of that growth that would take we could calculate how much worse than this ideal figure mining profitability will be but we can't so that would be guesswork.
If anyone knows of any protocol-based reasons (rather than stats-based reasons) why my solo reward numbers are wrong then please enlighten me :)
Edit: Blockchain's [transaction-fees] ( chart seems to show that with solo-mining you can get very lucky if solve particular blocks, or at least earn a fraction of BTC in fees typically. Who knows how many transactions and fees could be in the block you solve by the time you solve it?

I would prefer my next job to offer a split between BTC and fiat that I could adjust each month. Or just BTC if that's too difficult. I understand there are some difficulties/volatilities with salaries in terms of market price. Having a reasonable BTC remuneration in your contract is going to be bad for you unless you can re-negotiate every time mtgox has a bad day.
I saw something here that talked about a rising global wage floor emerging after x, y and z have happened but I think in the meantime (thus year at least) I'd have to agree the contract amount in fiat. If the UK, companies could offer to spread the GBP/EUR/DOL conversion fees across many staff wanting a portion in BTC.
There is also the issue of keeping taxed vs untaxed income seperate. Permanent vs contractors might require different levels of transparency/declaration.

I also don't understand your question  
If you add an order to buy and an order to sell (as works on localbitcoin.com) the cart adds them both values with the same sign - the sell doesn't appear as a negative amount. Try it, it's a joke.

If I understand your idea right, its that a public QR code that doesn't change takes the buyer to your site which then produces the Bitcoin address to put the money in. Why would you want different addresses for different payments that all came in on the same project QR code?
I think you can embed an informational URL to a Bitcoin QR code as a parameter, though the clients probably don't support it very well at the moment.
People would have to trust that you didn't slip your own QR code in there for 1% of visitors. What do they get in exchange for that trust? I'm not seeing it, sorry. Good luck though!

Sorry for being stupid but I really don't get it.
Why do you have shipping addresses? I haven't created an account but do you have buyer and seller feedback? If I shouldn't be able to buy and sell at the same time then the site shouldn't let me try.


Bitcoins are not kept at banks (yet). What you mean is 'we have no users wanting to be paid into this bank'. However you also say:


So you're an escrow service. The problem is you're trying to take 1%-2% of transactions without offering any added value as far as I can see. I could do this on localbitcoins.com without the fee or use BTCrow for 1%.
If a seller puts $100 worth up for sale there is no reserve. If there was a flash crash the buyer could be matched with more coins than the seller has or is prepared to part with. It sounds like there are a lot of manual steps and you didn't answer my question about automation.


This reeks of unscalable manual processes and opportunities for you to be given all sorts of stress. It seems more like a legacy banking service than a Bitcoin business.
Even the fact that it is a (contrived) way to get coins for cash the one advantage that could have (anonymity) is lost with the bank account. I also have to find a branch of the seller's bank and go out and put cash in, get a receipt and business card from the teller (investigations into deals gone wrong for you are not going to be cheap). How easy is it to fake a deposit slip?
I can transfer money in the UK with online banking. Why would I want to take cash to a bank and deposit it in Jo Blogg's account?
The main reason I'm just not seeing the value in this idea is that it is easier, cheaper and safer to use localbitcoins to buy or BTCRow to escrow. Good luck though.

Moving all the coins would be more like stealing. Move your own, for sure. Make sure the change gets back to the original address since you could be using clients that handle change in a different way.
You could see if the address is tagged in blockchain.info or similar but no way to message them. Try sending some back to the sending address and see if they notice maybe?

Different languages, the person might not believe it, notaries cost money, I could set up a fake site with fake letters for people. Mainly, the global nature of Bitcoin and once people trust that they will trust simple things like this based off it. Make it just another site that they feel might get hacked in a few months and it's hard to get buy-in. I know, keys need protecting either way.
By using it as a clearing house between clinics and users it allows for multiple verification apps/sites to compete on a level playing field with access to the same data regardless of them not being the first to market.


Have learned my lesson and am writing my lines now, "I shall not poke Bitcoin with a stick"


What about by including fees on a normal transaction? I wasn't serious about 'STDcoin' I was just looking for some lateral thinking. The consensus seems to be 'use certs and signatures, don't use Bitcoin' which is cool. People like distributed solutions though. I've found clinics to be all separate, run using different rules etc. even just in this country and trying to say 'use this big centralised global database for these newfangled accounts is going to get funny looks.

Your wallet does some magic. It sends change to the same address. Not all wallets do. Wallets that respect your privacy send your change to a new address (a new ECDSA keypair) that they create. If you make a purchase from such a wallet after importing your paper wallet, then destroy the software wallet thinking your coins are on the paper wallet, then you will be wrong and poorer.
Edit: Armory creates a deterministic sequence of private keys and a seperate sequence of public keys (and hence addresses). Generate and store the full wallet.dat on an offline computer and create the watch only copy for your online computer and the person paying into that wallet.

Yep, MetroBank to Bitstamp with a ~£17 (for up to a grand at least) fee, at least every month for the last few months. Waiting for some to clear from yesterday evening. Think I'll miss this weekend's action :( If only I'd got it in before 2pm yesterday.
Barclays say they charge 15 but ended up charging me 25. Metrobank explained the options of paying fees for both ends and have been really good (in conjunction with bitstamp's bank at least). Barclays committed to a fee during an online transaction with no disclaimer, then charged 25.
I just missed transferwise and it was the third and almost final avenue I'd explored (UKash, pingit much earlier this year). So I learned a bit about SEPA and now feel I know more about it than the poor staff at the counter.
If you want to trade localbitcoin then I don't know how they would react.

I was thinking that the reasons for using the Bitcoin blockchain in some way might be:
 * the clinic could charge for the service using the transaction
 * the system remains distributed, trust-able and maintenance-free
 * security; a chain dedicated to this would be so small as to be easily attacked
 * anonymity; the blockchain is downloaded by 'everyone' anyway
You're right, I understand that some things shouldn't be in the Bitcoin blockchain. I was looking for discussion about where/if/how it could be implemented in a better way than before Bitcoin upped everyone's game. Namecoin-like merged mining maybe, or coloured coins?
Good point about the mixing of keys. I imagine a separate 'STD' app for this purpose. You could still pay for the clinic's services as normal from a new address from your normal wallet. The clinic act as a mixing service and could then send a multisig transaction to a new address created by the 'STD' app.
Even if the user entered the same passphrases for both their normal wallet and  the STD address, as long as the STD app doesn't aim for deterministic Bitcoin keys in the same way as wallets, you would have different, unrelated keys.

PayPal isn't a currency. Maybe they want to use OT to make PayPalPounds or get a foothold in a solar-system-scale blockchain. Great PR but nothing to actually do for decades and the problems have already been solved by others.

True at a stretch. Maybe the whole team will adopt the name. Keep up the good work Sean!

Bitcoin won't scale to every tiny transaction made in the world.
At some point it will likely become the international currency reserve or gold standard and other currencies will be pegged off it, OpenTransaction style. There can be inflatable, centrally-controlled, government-backed currencies as well as distributed, capped ones that provide quicker confirmations or different economic parameters.
Don't know why I wrote this as it has little to do with the topic. Ah well.

Good point; rapid, en-mass adoption by Iran wouldn't be great for Bitcoin's image.
Although how do we know Satoshi wasn't working for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad?

This is their pre-built kit I think. If they are delivering these now they may release the chips just after, just a guess though. I'm in SebastianJu's group-buy (batch 5).
These batch numbers don't correlate with the group-buy batch numbers though.

And that's just at 2% simple interest.

Can you sign up for sites using 1mybitcoinaddress I tried to sign up and got:




No twitter account so can't send a but report, sorry. Unless you also accept them at 1BUGzQ7CiHF2FUxHVH2LbUx1oNNN9VnuC1

Cool. So to be completely anonymous now you can get a new face using your anonymous Bitcoins.

I'm now thinking they put them on mtgox. You know that 6000BTC sell wall at 267? Well...

True enough. I don't like the way there are dozens of companies that have access to everyone's records here in the UK because of the backwards way the NHS IT was 'modernised'. I heard the project was behind and Google were stepping in, not sure how that panned out.
It's opt-in though, that should count for something?

So according to Apple it's illegal to spend Bitcoins anywhere in the world? Would that be the storing of private keys (done by other apps presumably), signing of transactions or putting them on the network that they are otherwise happy for you to talk to?
What would they say to three apps, one to hold a key, one to sign and one to put on the network. What you gonna do now, Apple?
It's obviously to keep iPhone users from seeing the benefits before they've done some work on their patent for iMoney that relies on exactly the same regs.
FinCen's clarification isn't enough for them then, they want a blessing from every department of every government before they'll let that one through. They clearly don't have anyone there that knows about being subtle when abusing their position in one market to try to corner another. If they didn't have such a small and shaky mobile market they would be ripe for an anti-trust case. Not that there would be one of course.
I do hope this is the start of the end for Apple now and I'm glad I've never given them a penny. I wonder what [Wozniak]( or Jobs would have thought of Bitcoin.
Slightly less cynically, maybe they're just afraid of people losing money and Apple getting a bad name for security.
Edit: grammar

Haha, in that case it should be much higher!

Deprioritorisation, my bad.

I think you get paid out (a smaller amount) if you lose. Never used it though, and you should use it with restraint, too. Beware gambling!

Doing something unspeakable to Gavin or other developers would leave Bitcoin where it is in terms of developement for a short time but the network would continue to run and transactions would be unaffected. Others would come forward to take on the role, most likely anonymously.
The idea of killing all the early adopters and supporters (if you can find them) won't work either. These people have day jobs that support the legacy economy so it would be cutting off their nose to spite their face.
If they wanted to do something insanely severe like that I'm surprised they didn't nerve-gas the San Jose conference. They must have done some reconnaissance there and added a few names to their 'naughty' list.
As the quote goes, "Look, the people you are after are the people you depend on. We cook your meals, we haul your trash, we connect your calls, we drive your ambulances. We guard you while you sleep. Do not... fuck with us".
