I would rather stay where I am. I would rather not be subjected to violence by men in silly costumes.

Honestly, [this]( video would likely answer a lot of questions involving how law would work without a state. It is an excerpt from "The Machinery of Freedom" by David Friedman. Reading the book would also answer a lot of your questions. It is available online for free [here]( It is  a quick read and I liked it a lot.

Your'e right. I forgot that banks are 100% unregulated and that is why they do such terrible things. /s

I don't hold a high opinion of police, but in the current state of affairs there is little that he can do. Should no one be a doctor because the field of medicine is a racket? Should no one farm because of agricultural subsidies?
I have heard no specific incidences of this man doing anything wrong in particular. He seems to be as libertarian as we are likely to get. This is the same town that threatened to shoot down drones.

Could you do me a favor and provide an article that describes something he does?
If that something could be a daily occurrence that would be great.

So. What about the Jews in Germany during the Holocaust? 
Were they allowed to fight back or were they to lie down and die because of the "social contract"?

too true

Are you asking these questions because you want answers or because you think that they are impossible to answer and therefore validate the state?

We get it, you like violence, now go shut down a kid's lemonade stand.

Actually, this guy is performing a job upon which the state has claimed a monopoly. He can't provide private law and security because the state won't let him. He's apparently doing his best to live free in an unfree world.

They can never answer this question. It is so sad.
