Bitcoin won't reach mass adoption so I guess no problem there.

Their service was never reliable in the first place; I don't know why people keep using them.

How much did you receive from Bitcoin tips? If you don't mind sharing of course. My estimate is about $300?
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:38:08
You could buy an Amazon.co.uk gift certificate with [pock.io]( I've spent over £900 on there without a problem.
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:23:12
Is it better now?

[I think this answers your question](
I'd advice going with Armory, they offer a solid feature for paper wallet backups.

It's really nice to look at all those achievements and being able to say "I remember this". Thank you.

They have literally the most unreliable API I've ever come across. I've actually lost money because of their terrible error handling (throwing an error but sending the payment anyway), and that's just one example of my awful experience with them.
@_date: 2014-12-08 13:57:21
I've been addressing this issue for weeks, today I messaged the mods with my concerns. This needs to stop, memes, comedy, bashing should completely be deleted/not allowed here. Whoever wants to laugh at retarded memes can create a new sub for that.
@_date: 2014-11-18 12:54:28
Editing the comment doesn't change the tip amount if the bot had already seen it. Thanks anyway.

I guarantee you there's more beggars online than on the streets. It's easy and you don't need to show your face.

That doesn't make any sense, it's the same thing as not storing anything. The point of having the credit card saved on merchants is for recurring payments and user convenience (not having to re-enter the details again).
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:59:44
Why aren't we over this? I've see this shit on the homepage countless times.
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:45:28
I said **should**. I made an educated request to the mods, it's up to them to decide what's best. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 13:25:35
1 bit = 0.00000100 BTC (one millionth of a bitcoin).

Not unfortunate and not lost.

If people understand what Bitcoin is, then learning how to use bits can't be that much of a deal. And I guess it's better to do it now than later on. BTW, even though I agree with using a new term for *100 satoshis* I don't think *bits* is the best because of the metric system.

How is this site helping Bitcoin succeed? All I see it someone who put 2 hours into making a website to then collect money from unaware advertisers for their fake "high traffic page". I guarantee you they will send you SPAM and/or sell your contact information (email address) to some shady companies.

This is the kind of post that makes outsiders think we're all idiots. We're here to discuss the topic "Bitcoin" and anything relevant to it, not to make cheap jokes and laugh at stupid memes.

Wow, that is really funny.
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:46:46
Just to clarify, they have received 28 donations in Bitcoin, not 28 bitcoins in donations. The total donated amount is currently at [6.5 BTC]( which is pretty nice.

Legit question. How was a block mined at the exact same time he made the transaction?
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:17:26
That's definitely related with Bitstamp, all the bitcoins on my deposit address were transferred to 1L2JsXHPMYuAa9ugvHGLwkdstCPUDemNCf. I really hope the address belongs to Bitstamp and not an hacker.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:10:14
Working perfectly for me. Probably something wrong with your DNS, try to clean your cache or use Private Browsing, if that doesn't work try using Google DNS servers.

What about the human factor? I've tried to get a healthy discussion about this but I got downvoted to oblivion last time.
The human population is constantly growing, doesn't it affect deflation?
If you have 21 million BTC for 6 billion people on Earth and then 10 years later there are 12 billion people the average person should be holding half of 10 years ago. I think inflation is necessary because of this. Think about all the big companies that hoard more and more money, it cuts circulation, and if happens too much the inequality would be even greater than it is now.
This is just my opinion, don't vote because you agree/disagree, I want to see what others have to say about this.
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:14:51

I have received my Bitcoin withdrawal just now, 2 minutes after requesting it.

I'm sorry but I won't do that, I've been using the same address for over a year so I don't feel comfortable sharing it.
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:32:21
Same thing, you'll have to trust the other party to broadcast the transaction.

~400€ for me.

Now? It has been happening for months, if not since the very beginning. Most of this community is made by immature people with 0 knowledge of economics and day dreamers that think they will get insanely rich (soon) with 10 BTC.

Most people here think that bank/credit card annuities are the most horrible thing to ever exist, yet spending $119+ on a hardware wallet is fine.
