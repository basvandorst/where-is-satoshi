well if we see some more collapse in euro and no jobs it could be going a way to germany with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-13 09:11:17
well explained.
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:15:47
nope there isn't,even the so called Kuveyt turk one bank in germany is making profit of intrest in his own banking system,that is where it gets tricky,muslims can't use it even if the bank calls it "halal" banking.

wish i could argue with you about this specific thing petro islam.my damn english is not that good.but one thing; petro islam,wiki refers it to wahhabism.wahhabism is not "the" path to islam.
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:55:39
this is so true,there is also a very big open market in the finance sector for muslims,there is no "halal" bank in entire europe.

@_date: 2013-12-26 18:33:47
my "newbie" friend have them send to a random "adress" tab on bitcoin-qt   
there are now on my phone but i see that it is impossible to know the private key...
the adress 
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:10:59
so how do i obtain the private key from bitcoin-qt then ? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:52:56
that's the problem i can't obtain this private key,so it is now some expensive air :D
lesson learned:never tell family about the new technology....

Preconfigured adress was on the desktop,That adress is never been used,it is saved on the desktop.at the moment is it on my blockchain wallet and cant send it to an other adress.to s3nd to another wallet IS BLOCKchain asking for a private key.thats the story
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:35:44
in the adresses tab of the program.it's a random one (bitcoin-qt)
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:33:35
