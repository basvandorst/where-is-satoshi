I can add log chart in settings in the next version.  Let me know if you guys have any other feedback.
From my understanding it's fine to have tipping so long as it happens in safari instead of in the app.

You can't send gold halfway around the world in seconds.
I think gold is a good store of wealth, however, I think it has no chance of being a currency in the 21st century.

haha true.  Edit: you can't *easily send gold halfway around the world in seconds.

bummer, ok.  I'll resubmit it with imgur.com once the app is available.

Thanks, no android.  I only know how to program iOS apps right now.

I used swift for this one.  It was actually my first time using swift.  I wanted to become fluent in it, so I bit the bullet and made this one 100% swift.  I really like swift after learning it.
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:51:33
I agree with this.
@_date: 2015-03-02 02:06:45
Cool, thanks.

It's possible Apple Pay could integrate with Bitcoin in the future.
Then shiny product in shiny box.
@_date: 2015-03-02 01:55:36
Hallelujah!  Thank you.

You would simply load it with paper and ink and press print.
Then you'd send money into the paper wallet with the QR code.
It would never ever connect to the internet to prevent malware.
Its random number generator would be based on a ton of stuff: built in accelerometer, temperature, etc (to make sure it's truly random)
You could store these in a safe or something.

No not right now, just beginner level.  That would be cool.  Maybe someday.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:39:48
Thanks.  I was actually impatient with Apple's review process last week and it motivated me to start learning about android development.  But I'm still a total beginner and am really focused on iOS.  So maybe someday but not in the near future.

If I use my card at a store the transaction shows up on my site a couple of business days later.  A transfer takes longer to show up.  So I basically never know what my exact balance is.

I was originally planning on having a way to subtract spent bitcoins but I wasn't able to find an elegant solution that I was satisfied with.
Right now as a workaround you can just edit a purchase and subtract the amount you spent out of it.
but that's a good idea of having frozen value at the time they were spent.  It's still working in the back of my mind.  I'm sure I'll think of an elegant way to implement it in the future.  It might work better if I just create a brand new app for that.  Otherwise this app might get a little bloated.

You oughta sell those orange pillows!  I was so about to impulse buy one.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:30:32
thanks ;)
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:30:57
sorry about that.  I'll add other currencies in the future.

Here's my understanding: (please someone correct me if I'm wrong) 
Retailers actually save your credit card number.  Technically they could charge it at anytime, but they don't because then you'd report them as being a fraud and they'd get chargebacks.
However, hacker's could break into their system to get the card numbers and start to use the numbers until the credit card fraud department shuts them down.
So every time you use your card at a new retailer you are increasing the risk of fraud on your card because it's possible that their system could be hacked.  (This is one of the features of ApplePay is that you can store your card in just one place: Apple's database and then they never hand over your credit card number but instead transfer special payment keys that verify the transaction.)
With a Bitcoin transaction, you don't give "access to your account" and trust they don't abuse it, but rather you're actually sending an asset that they now have access to and you don't.  Just like when you exchange paper currency with someone: they now have the paper and you don't.
So you can't make a false payment (fraud) with bitcoin like you can with a credit card because you're not giving access to your account, but rather are transferring ownership of something.
Again this is just my understanding, so please someone correct me if I'm wrong.

Good idea, I'll look into this.
@_date: 2015-02-24 03:38:54
Yeah, it's interesting.  Thanks, I just posted it there too.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:04:27
Good point.  That one feature opens up an entire industry of potential applications.
