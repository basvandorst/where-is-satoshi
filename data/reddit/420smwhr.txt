I have always wanted a white face Rolex Daytona and thought once my crypto is worth enough to get one it's going to be tough to HODL. The day came and went and despite how bad I thought I wanted the watch I found I wanted my bitcoin more and didn't even give it a second thought and still HODL. 
One day I might reach a point where I will want something more than I want my bitcoin....always wanted a Ferrari too!

I heard from a friend that you can use clean piss from someone you KNOW is clean. It won't matter the age or sex of the "donor". You can put the clean pee in a tylenol bottle and wrap a Thermal care heat wrap around the bottle to keep the temp up (this will keep the temp within the necessary range for a few hours. The container can be held in the cup pocket of a jock strap until you are in the stall and ready to pour it in the cup. I recommend doing the transfer over the toilet in case of spillage.

Right now Coinbase decides what happens to your coins during a fork or anything else and you have to trust they have YOUR best interest in mind. If you hold your coins on a hw wallet you control what happens with your coins with the thought being you will have your best interest in mind. Now that I've said that I used Coinbase for over 2yrs to hold my coins until I felt comfortable moving them. The only thing worse than an exchange losing your coins is you losing coins by making a rookie mistake. I would order a ledger nano s or something similar and learn all you can in the time it takes it to get delivered. Best of luck
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:36:21
I started by setting them up a coinbase account and sent bitcoin to it. Once they had a little bit they were much more interested. They didnt want to pit their bank info in for the first few months so they would send me cash and i would buy on coinbase and xfer it to them. Eventually they set up their bank info and we cut that step out. Since they were on coinbase I then slowly showed them ETH and LTC; now apparently my dad has heard about IOTA somewhere. I eventually moved their coins to a ledger nano s i had as a back-up, transferred coins for then, made a short video for them about how it works and sent it to them. My dad now keeps the ledger locked in his big gun safe. Which is good because I use my parents as a safe storage place for a copy of my seed and I have a copy of theirs in case something happens

It's not the regulation as much as the regulator that scare people. Laws are written with so much gray area that how the regulator interprets the regulation and how they implement regulation to achieve what they think the goal of the regulation was meant to be. This is what creates the problems that people fear with the introduction of more regulation: the person doing the regulating.

IOTA is already like this where iota is the basic unit but all pricing and trades are done in MIOTA which equals 1,000,000iota, 1000MIOTA = 1 Gig-iota and so on and so on. Go look at the iota sub posts from back in December and look what a hell of a time new people had wrapping their heads around it. Its died down lately because they stickied a few posts about it. My point is tho that if you have heard of IOTA and you are looking to buy some then you almost certainly already have bitcoin or have heard of it before IOTA so imagine the issues bitcoin newbs would have trying to do the same thing. Plus take a look on Ebay and see how many ads there are for IOTA but they are selling 100iota for like $50 and buyers think they are getting 100MIOTA because that's all they see for prices or on exchanges. We need to make it easier to onboard new people and not make them more confused and prone to getting scammed.

Bad in which sense? It will undoubtedly lead to price increases across the board and a much larger user base.

If you really believe in Bitcoin and are looking for more than a quick buck it is not too late. If in the long run you believe that (a) one day each bitcoin will be worth 6 figures + or more or (b) you never will have to sell because dollars will be priced in bitcoin is it really going to matter to you if you initially paid $5000, $6000 or even $10000? If you don't believe in it do not get into it and do more research about it instead or you will sell at a loss on the first 20% dip and miss out anyway

Generally it takes a mature market to crash an economy. The more mature the market that's is crashing the further the fall. The housing market caused such a big dip because it was a mature market that reached into every corner of the economy as a result of exotic debt products and possibly too much regulation in some aspects. Even if Wall Street gets involves now and crash it the size of the market would limit the damage. Look how many years Wall Street was involved in the housing market before they screwed it up. I agree that they will eventually screw it up but it wont be overnight and it wont be anything like the housing bubble or even the coming soverign debt problems. Wall Street will start out trading crypto for themselves and clients but when the market matures and returns level off they will start rolling out debt/credit instruments and other crazy stuff simply to gain alpha that is when it's time to jump ship but until then enjoy the rocket ride. As much as I like bitcoin nothing lasts forever

I have only used the Ledger but from what I understand the trezor is also good but doesn't support as many alt coins. The set up is easy just be sure to write down the recovery seed and test it with a small amount before sending the whole amount. When these forks happen just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy the show. Once the dust clears Ledger will post instructions on Reddit for how to proceed. If anything happens to the physical device you are safe as long as you have your seed. The other plus is you can have multiple accounts on the same device with separate PIN numbers to access them. I also keep a 2nd unopened Ledger in a safe place in case something happens to the loaded one.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:04:44
In that case my honest advice would be to keep doing what you're doing. Your instincts at $5100 were spot on  but even with that I bet you were surprised how quick it recovered. One good thing about investing in bitcoin is that it doesn't require any more of your time than you are willing to spend on it. There are no quarterly reports to monitor or the latest press release from the company and such. Over time I have been surprised at what things I am willing to cut back on so I can just learn more and more about it but as an investor mybreturns would have been the same as not looking at it at all. Not to mention that you are using holding an investment as a way to better yourself which will be the best investment in the long run.

I have had a fairly good job since 2010 and been maxing the 401k every year with a 100% company match. My crypto investments over the last 2 years has almost equalled my 401k total and the amount I got from cashing out the BCH was about half of what I had invested out of pocket in BTC. I have a retirement outlook for my cryptos.

@_date: 2017-09-19 23:11:48
My 2 bits... seems like you are young and have a long time horizon before retirement. The stock market is headed for a crash this fall and everyone knows it. With that in mind say you do take out a loan on the 401k and you pay 6.25% interest TO YOURSELF!!! So while the rest of your 401k balance is going down the toilet you know that you will be making 6.25% on the loan portion which will help offset the loss in the rest of your 401k. If bitcoin is up enuf by the end of the year you can sell enuf to pay off the loan with interest. You end up with a much smaller loss in your 401k as a result of the stock market correction and profited the BTC you didn't have to sell to payback the loan. Same thing works with longer time horizons but the stock market performance becomes more unpredictable. I'm just saying that 401k does not only go up they also go down in market corrections. How these people can say "don't put your eggs in 1 basket" and also say to basically keep your 401k money in an "approved" basket and don't touch it for anything else shows how brainwashed they really are.

Coinbase allowed me to buy and hold bitcoin with little to no knowledge about what I was buying. Once I had skin in the game I started learning more and more. Buying little by little and after considerable price appreciation it became more and more of my net worth and i just decided that I knew enuf to have control without screwing it up. I never had a problem with coinbase and it stung a little when I took the 1btc out of the vault since I put it there in the $300 range and at the time thought I would never move it

Maybe not overall but think of the early adopters that heard of bitcoin because "their friends" were buying stuff on there with bitcoin. When society has a choice between 2 standards it is often the deviants that point us to the eventual winner.

Doesnt seem to hurt the USD value and it's way more popular with criminals than BTC.

@_date: 2017-10-15 14:02:15
It's a little more complicated than that as the rise in price will take at best a few years and more likely 5 - 10 years. During that time there will be population growth, economic growth, more gold will be mined and God knows money supply growth all while the max number of coins is constant. If there is a serious financial crisis all bets are off as far as valuation goes. For reference look at the size of the gold market at the financial crisis and how much it moved to knock on the door of 2k an oz. Bitcoin will also reduce costs and increase productivity in an economy as it is implemented which also has a knock on effect. Asking what the possibilities are is like asking in 1994 what the internet could be worth...just so much that we don't know we don't know

A month ago I took a loan on my 401k and invested the loan proceeds over a couple weeks into BTC. Thought process ran like this: EVERYONE on Wall Street is expecting a pullback from current levels. So instead of my 401k taking a hit in the coming pullback my 401k will have a 5.25% return from the interest I am paying on the loan. Once the market has corrected and looks set to go back up i will sell just enuf btc, which at that point should be much higher than where it was when i invested the proceeds, to repay the loan and keep the profit along with any forked coins I pick up along the way. Since my 401k plan allows it I am considering another loan if the stock market pullback hasn't occurred by mid November

what would I do with myself if I wasn't checking the price every 2 mins that's half the fun

I did take a loan on my 401k in Sept and jumped in around 3500. Granted I was already In BTC for a while but with everyone on wall street calling for a downturn in stocks I figured i am better off paying interest to myself than loose it in the coming stock market correction. I didn't take the max amount since it was my first time doing it but I have plans to take a larger portion in the near future. I plan on paying the loan early with my btc profits and ended up getting the BTC at a good price while guaranteeing a 5.25% return thru the markets coming turmoil.

Bitcoin ticker widget by XBT apps on Android will allow you to point the app at the exchange of your choice for the price.  you can use multiple widgets for multiple cryptos or different exchanges or to see the btc price priced in different fiat currencies. I have an entire screen of them with each tracking a different crypto. I have been using it for a couple years and it's great.

Not that I agree with him but he is very smart guy and didn't get where he is by constantly tipping his hand or being stupid. I have a feeling when everything is said and done we will see he knew exactly what he was doing with these outbursts. He already found out a lot of other major banks (his competitors) thoughts on crypto with his previous statement without having to do anything.

I have been holding for a few years and finally spent some btc 2 days ago buying a bitcoin shirt I saw here on Reddit. Then I immediately went and bought more bitcoin plus a little extra just for good measure.
At .0063btc it will prolly end up being the most expensive shirt I ever own ��

If that logic held we would never have had the last bull run. In the lead up to the bull run there was a nearly 18month crypto winter where the very same groups you talk about (hodlers, 1st timers...)were having the same feelings when they had purchased BTC at the previous high and yet it still didnt work out quite the way you describe.

We could all start mining on out laptops again before it gets to $0 and there are way too many believers with spare laptops or PC parts lying around and would put them to work

Coinbase is a great place to get your feet wet or if you are just trying to get rich quick but if you take the time to learn about bitcoin and why it was created then the "why not coinbase" question will answer itself.
