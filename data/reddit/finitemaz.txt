There's nothing to agree with.  I just want to use an exchange that works, and if it doesn't work I will come to reddit to find out what the hell is going on.  Your comment is not needed.
If their site is down, throw up a simple twitter update saying what is going on.  I don't get why people feel the need to stand by coinbase and attempt to belittle peoples posts about a clear flaw with them.  Talk about truly pathetic.

Coinbase is back up for the time being.  I took my entire wallet off of it, this company needs to do something different if they want to be taken seriously.
No twitter updates, constant problems with back up credit cards, problems logging in, randomly sending me messages about my limit being increased when it hasn't, randomly requiring ID photos be uploaded, 10 errors when trying to upload said ID, expensive fees.  All in all, why does anyone choose coinbase?
How much longer are you staying with coinbase? You're holding yourself down man, be done with those fools.

Is it illegal to get it shipped to the US?
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:29:15
Yes, it's irritating.  There is always an issue with coinbase it seems.

Does anyone know anything about this new tax rule for 2018? Something about 3 year long term holding rather than 1 for lower capital gains tax?  I read something but can't find it now.

It's all fun and games until they issue a real scam token, and people start losing real money for a hyped token that piggybacked on a viral show.

"Call their altcoin "Bcash", ask them how it's better than Dash or Ethereum."
You missed Litecoin. 
Honestly, Bcash is better than Dash and Ethereum lol
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:36:13
Just opinions here... ICOs are scams.  Ethereum's only utility is for scams.  Bloated chain.  Never meant to be a store of value / or good "money".  Massive 72 million ETH premine. 
Litecoin has already won scaling and has Segwit.  LN development, tumblebit, rsk, etc...
Just my opinion of course...
@_date: 2019-10-16 13:10:22
What happens if majority of hash decides to stop enforcing segwit rules and spend the "anyone can spend" segwit outputs?  Does longest chain prevail?

How complicated is the UASF code?  Is there any chance of bugs that would be devastating for BTC/LTC? (where value could plummet to zero)
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:50:40
Can this run both a BTC and LTC full node at the same time?
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:12:42
not really a good testnet if they don't have value.

I have met the threshold, and still did not receive anything... have you? Wondering why I would have been left out, I dont want to contact Coinbase support in case they end up sending the IRS forms that they normally wouldnt have about me.

You're arguing to make your own scam coin to compete with Litecoin?  Nothing about what you linked to says it to be a scam, and what about those things would be different in your new shitcoin? (besides maybe parameter changes) Honestly, after reading through your comments today, I have to seriously reconsider your efforts with UASF.

The entire ethereum network is suffering from giant backlogs due to the BAT ICO. Network-wide issue.  Sorry to all ethtards thinking Ethereum was some sort of fairy dust savior in scaling. LOL
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:56:09
Have you looked at the eth network lately? lol

Oh, so there very well could be no news about the ETF at all lol.

Ethereum will never be a good store or transfer of value. What is so hard for people to understand? 72 million premined (out of ~92 million currently in circulation), no hard cap on supply, never mean to be a store of value, only "utility" is for scammy ponzi ICO's, no real world usage other than that, get rich quickers buying the top of the bubble is becoming really really obvious. No one knows what they are holding. It is not supposed to be a good store of value for investors. It is not good money.
What you are seeing now is a hyped bubble in ETH land.  I do wish you luck in your gambling game of musical chairs though.

Segwit is a signal to the market that Litecoin is the leader in scaling &amp; off-chain market &amp; research. BTC wont see scaling but it will remain the immutable protocol for settlement it was designed to be. There will be no upgrades to it's protocol imo. Too much risk. LTC will win scaling. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:08:07
Nothing. Because nothing will happen on August 1st.  BTC will remain the immutable protocol for settlement it was designed to be, and will receive no upgrades. It will still be king.
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:27:06
Why does it have to be replaced? Segwit is a signal to the market that Litecoin is the leader in scaling &amp; off-chain market &amp; research.  BTC wont see scaling but it will remain the **immutable protocol for settlement it was designed to be**. LTC will win scaling. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:20:48
You say "stagnant" as if no one will be using it.  There will still be value because it is valued today.  Bitcoin unchanged is still the Bitcoin that is valued today.  Plenty of altcoins have been doing everything it does and more.  Bitcoin is king the way it is, and it will remain king even if it doesnt get upgrades.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:35:21
There's a chance, but I dont see it happening.  The elites and mega whales will not let the risk of that happening take place.
