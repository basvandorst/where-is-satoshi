They are growing to be quite common in London now.

Take some clean piss with you just in case though.

Honestly don’t waste your time or money mate. Ledger supports literally every altcoin so if it’s not even on there that’s telling you something.

Your wrong. Coinbase do offer a service that allows their customers to access forked BCH coins.

Crazy when you think about it. If he had committed the same crimes in Europe he would have been sentenced to 6 years and been out on 3. They love throwing away the key in America. 
* European law dictates that a person can’t be imprisoned for the duration of their life. (unless they are a complete nutter that can’t be fixed)

The word Regulation makes the average person feel comfortable, very few are actually running away from regulated services. Without regulation the world we live in would be even more chaotic that is currently is. 
Main stream adoption goes hand in hand with regulation, this is the reason congress and governments all over the world are discussing bitcoin!!

It’s not the building of the houses that’s the problem, it’s the space to build them on. Unless you live in a shit hole town in which case you probably got loads of space

It’s funny that you think the London protest against trump were done because of his argument with our mayor and not because of his treatment of women, Hispanics, people of colour and those with disabilities etc. 
Trump doesn’t even like red necks or working class white people yet you clowns voted for him. Congratulations you played yourself.

Because China isn’t one person, it’s a country you muppet. Some of you Americans are really shitting your pants over China’s progress on the world stage. 
Nothing lasts forever it’s their turn now.

LTC halving is not like BTC halving. historical data would have shown you this.
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:25:56
Don’t over do it. Just keep your private keys hidden and that should be enough for the average bitcoiner.
@_date: 2019-12-27 12:45:17

Curious to see what happens if you beg for money on the internet. Really ?? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:20:12
How many transactions are you averaging a week. ? Are more people buying or selling ?

Let’s not get carried away now. He’s still a criminal, the real issue is with the USA justice system. If he had been convicted in any European country he would be a free man now. Travelling,   talks and writing books.

LOL what kinda people have you been giving your name and address to
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:13:02
75% into bitcoin now means you get to retire early as apposed to never. Go for it!!

I’m from the UK, it’s super weird seeing Lizzie on your notes. Also she looks a lot younger on UK notes.
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:23:40
Yeah basically, that’s why guys in Nigeria make a shit load of money from telling people they have inherited a fortune from a relative they the know doesn’t exist but need money to release the funds. 
2019 - “ get rich from crypto without spending a penny”
@_date: 2019-09-26 22:13:16
LOL you actually sound really hurt by all of this. Best thing to do is just stop following it on a daily basis. It’s not like the price  tomorrow is going to be much better than it is today.
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:34:21
LOL what’s your beef with Coinbase ? Or do you have beef with any company or organisation that makes a shit tone of money. Good for them!!  
It’s a free market, people can do whatever they want, learn to accept that. 
If someone wants to buy a shitcoin let them, one mans shit is another mans gold. Plenty of people have made millions trading shitcoins and will continue to do so. 
Most of them move in sync with bitcoin, people don’t care or understand the tech they just want to make money. Same as you!!!
@_date: 2019-09-25 22:50:24
So what your saying is you can make me rich ?? and I don’t have to do anything ?? 
I’m interested, How much ??

@_date: 2019-09-24 12:44:22
This is really captivating!! You know 
Listening to two guys who clearly don’t know anything about bitcoin. I Couldn’t even listen to the end.
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:45:53
LOL you’ve probably never been to the UK or left America. Fox News is not a reliable source for information regarding international politics!!!
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:09:17
Sure, “a possible theory” you have no idea what your talking about. verbal diarrhoea
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:15:39
I think it looks kinda cool.  The resurrection gonna be a madness
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:50:47
Don’t listen to this clown. He’s has no idea what he’s talking about. Probably never submitted tax information to HMRC in his life and never will do. 
Just take a look at his profile and you’ll see that  he’s not just dumb but also lazy and can’t seem to figure out why women don’t find him attractive.
