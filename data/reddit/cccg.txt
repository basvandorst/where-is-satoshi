Well, I lost some money in Gox, but I don't think it's up to the community to reimburse anyone from mtgox. As Adults who willingly sent their money overseas to some exchange in Japan who had information online about the withdrawls situation, I would argue traders should have been aware of the risks associated and are therefore responsible for the loss. They should have just done their research better (that's what I tell myself, anyway).
Maybe what's better is to constantly remind people new to mtgox how to securely store their bitcoins themselves so that they can't get stolen, and reiterate to never keep large sums of money on an exchange, reminding them this whole debacle in the years to come. MtGox was not a bank.

well, I think the parallel is fair but not entirely accurate. Full Tilt had its accounts frozen and were investigated by the FBI. We do not know if a criminal investigation today is what shut down mtgox, and can only speculate on hoards of unverified sources.
I feel like we will know very soon what the outcome will be, and whether folks even have a chance of seeing their funds again.

or move to a redneck part of the US where no one has heard of BTC

I like this story. More than the idea that we could run an exchange for 3 years and not notice BTC being gradually stolen, or that he was never solvent from the get-go.

but it sounds like they found out to the same media outlets as the rest of us (dubious scribd presentation, twitter, and a site being down). Anyway, they're probably right...

I just like to gamble/predict things like anyone else involved in speculation (IE everyone in this forum pretty much).

True, all 15 of my goxcoins which I doubt I'll ever see.... If you read this post or just the title, I'm just saying we will hear from them soon, not that they will resume withdrawls

On what account? also, the word *appear* makes it look like they don't know what's going on, and are trying to make statements to reassure the general public. mtgox.com being down is obviously bad news, but there is no specific information as to why it's down, what will happen next next, where is all the money etc. Just a bunch of speculation.

yeah, pretty much. I feel like this is a metric I would have been monitoring in real time if I were an exchange.

Thanks. I can't imagine how a Japanese lawyer would be able to get me funds from a bankrupt company to me. Besides, there's definitely a lesson to be learned in losing $10k by being greedy and trading on a shady platform.

correct. I'm sure with the forex and transfer fees, I probably owe someone money if I try to withdraw it though.

I am not sure exactly, but I probably messed up my claim. The initial deposit was $10,000USD. When they shut MtGox down, I am pretty sure most of my deposit was in BTC. I filed the claim asking for cash.  I am guessing this was the issue.
@_date: 2016-06-02 22:57:49
just the table. I'm sure the forex as well as the transfer fees make that 0.
