you aren't going to get as good of a price with bitcoin though. You are also going to have trouble marketing it with bitcoin.
If ebay or amazon took bitcoin as a payment method however, that would be a whole differen't story

lol you people say I'm over exaggerating yet yall freaking out of a 4% fee.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:06:18
I just paid the automatic fee.
Not sure how bitcoin is expecting to keep going if transactions take more than 1 minute to complete with large fees.
There is no way for businesses to expect to accept bitcoin if it takes as long as cashing a check. Without anyway to validate the legitimacy of the transaction.
A new cryptocurrency will replace it just saying

because I was talking about selling using paypal. a fee of 1.9% is not absurd whatsoever. That's barely any.

I was originally complaining because I thought I had done everything right and that bitcoin was just slow as shit. clearly I was wrong there
The fee was automatically applied. I assumed it was correct.

I know for a fact paypal's fees are not absurd. I actually buy and sell stuff using paypal as a payment method.
It's nice to know bitcoin has a faster speed with a larger transaction fee, wish blockchain.info would automatically set it bigger so I dont wait over 2 days for a transaction to confirm

...... you serious? lol. You want to talk about ridiculous fees look at selling on amazon. An average of 20-25% selling fee.
