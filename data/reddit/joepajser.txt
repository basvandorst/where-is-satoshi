It is possible to make direct donations to the RED CROSS and government on the links provided in the article.
We have created a public address and is currently in the proccess of activation and tagging by blockchain:  
I will be here for some time if you have any questions. 
Things are bad arround here and a lot of people lost everything what they have been building ther entire life...
**EDIT: if you believe this is a scam, checkout other news and sources and help either way you can (you have official serbian government paypal here:  ) or save the children

I'm glad people like it and show support (Luka from crobitcoin here). We will definitely work more on building the community in Croatia and the region! Thanks guys and big shout-out to bistri for starting the podcast
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:38:59
I'm not trying to convince them, I just asked that maybe people would share some good methods and arguments with me that they tend to use in such conversations. I always say on the beginning of such conversations. It's up to you to use just like you would use Euro or USD you can use BTC.

Sabotage and propaganda are the tools of the party which is loosing the "war"! ;)

Yes they work, the central regions are hit the most. Maybe you can send some old tshirts, clothes, blankets whatever you feel it might help (basically everything)

There is a community voting in process till 20th of May.Check out the video for Coinsulter Team and if you like what we are trying to do, feel free to support us with your vote (don't forget to read the vote instructions in green sidebar). Let's show that Bitcoin technology has a great social impact!
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:27:36
exactly, that's why I started this thread. In my mind I understand everything or at least "I think I understand". Skepticizm is good because they show me where should I gather more knowledge and how to improve. That why I asked people if they could share some experience, to see their views and opinions how they see Bitcoin and how they explain it.
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:45:44
Yes my fault, go save them children now :)
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:49:19

@_date: 2014-05-10 15:17:42
or vote for some other team, maybe you help them win something if you think our is rubbish :)
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:12:45
In my mind I understand. Or at least I think I understand. I must admit I started intersting myself for Bitcoin in 2011 but in the last 6 months I did an intensive resarch of the whole concept. Of course i'm doing everything related to Bitcoin only from my private aspect but people ask me and I give the the answers and arguments. My intention in the post is just to hear different opinions from you, the users, the skeptics and everybody else. It gives me insight how people think and what they want to ask. Also I heard today a lot how other people take different approach in explanations. This is not a post intended in "preaching Bitcoin religion". No, it's just a conversation about how people view this from different perspectives, and how to show someone or to make them less skeptical with Bitcoin. Not to convert them or make and inquistion on them. ;)
@_date: 2014-10-19 08:16:54
Excellent site!
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:48:44
Wow, thanks for sharing all the thoughts and experience. Well I must say I never traded something and in that sense I'm completely noob. Im studying information systems so I'm more on the tech side then economy but I feel that Bitcoin is just the connection for me. Would like to start something and share it in Croatia as I think we are a little backwards as a country and still not on the level as western countries (of course not all people) and be somewhat successful in it. So all tips are welcome because as I said I'm completely new to this. Thanks once more.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:45:17
you did well ;)
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:38:27
And it will stay like that... until they find something better!
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:11:08
thanks for your support! :)
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:07:21
I did answer and I do understand. Or at least I think I understand. I must admit I started intersting myself for Bitcoin in 2011 but in the last 6 months I did an intensive resarch of the whole concept. Of course i'm doing everything related to Bitcoin only from my private aspect but people ask me and I give the the answers and arguments.Maybe I'm not good at those arguments, maybe I am. Some people seem to be fascinated with the idea and some not. My intention in the post is just to hear different opinions from you, the users, the skeptics and everybody else. It gives me insight how people think and what they want to ask. Also I heard today a lot how other people take different approach in explanations.

A tee my friends and me designed to raise some "WTF" around people in our country and promote us ;)
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:14:05
As much as it would be the easiest way like that, I'd rather take a harder approach :)
I'm currently studying on faculty that is in Information &amp; Business systems, and the people that are there are smart and understand IT. There is people who accept Bitcoin but there is also skeptics with questions like I mentioned before.
But the point is not to explain how it functions on the technological level but the whole concept of Bitcoin and why should they accept it? 
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:15:49
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:21:46
Exactly, that's what some people told me today - that it is really abstract for them...
@_date: 2014-05-10 18:36:11
Thanks a lot! It has to be. Even for us its already a big achievement to be in the finals and we want to show that there is people also developing projects in this field! At least it made a bit noise on our faculty and community :) 
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:13:19
Ok maybe I exaggerated a little bit :D
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:53:11
But one question. Is that like trading on real stock exchange ( FOREX etc) or you can do that on cryptsy. I'm mainly interested in trading bitcoins for altcoins and vice versa but don't really understand the concept where do all those altcoins come from (Collosuscoin, BBQ coin , etc) do you have maybe a little insight and time to explain that? :)
@_date: 2014-05-20 08:18:35
yes, sure, right away!
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:36:19
Interesting answers, I like them! Here are some other questions they tend to ask me...
"What if the system fails? Who can take responsibility for my loss?"
"Why would I use Bitcoin for international transactions? Beside banks that are slow there is a number of services -Western Union, Paypal, Moneybookers"
Also... I told them the same thing.... in some countries the situation is good but what about the others.
I also told them about the possibllity of microlending and loans where you can help a farmer in Kenya to get his grains. Then they asked me..."How do you know that behind that address where you want to lend is the farmer, and not a fraudster?"
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:27:30
And how did it work out for you? As you said amateur investor - are you going plus or minus overall? I mean I would just like to hear you first experiences and thoughts from your first trades :).
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:02:31


This was my main question. I never wanted to convince anyone: "You should start using bitcoin now!". Just give them arguments and reasons why it has the potential to be something really good.
I always remember 5 years ago when i played a little World of Warcraft and had to buy subscription - my father always said "The police will come in our house because of your Internet and stuff..." because he didn't understand... Today he uses Internet Banking on his smartphone. People that first encounter a concept that is new or strange from  something that is "traditional" in the society are skeptical, of course. In my opinion Bitcoin technology has the potential to be something great and it doesn't need to eliminate everything before. But to show people that there is an alternative to something first you need to make them "a little less skeptical" and show in which ways they can benefit and in which ways take risk. This is just my opinion :)
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:39:55
When you see the logo, what you think? 
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:33:15
Yes I agree with that approach!

Help guys, any donation is useful. If you are located in the nearby countries there are probably some collection points where you can donate basic supplies.

Croatian Bitcoin Portal ( Hrvatski Bitcoin Portal ) is one of the media partners of the biggest Central European Bitcoin Expo held in Vienna next weekend (31.5 - 1.6). Check out the "English readers" section of the article for more info as we are giving away one ticket worth 150€ through a simple twitter competition/lottery. We are mostly oriented on the Balkan region so don't be confused becuase the website is in Croatian and this might be most appealing to the central European readers so you can read the article also on Croatian( if you understand :) ). Cheers!
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:00:48
Thanks for the advice. Well I guess to start real trading like that you need some real capital. As I'm a student I simply can't get to that amount of money for now. So I would actually try the concept as you said with something less just to get a grip of it. Btw. where do you trade bitcoins for real shares (NEOBEE)?
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:09:48
Why would you use paypal instead of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:17:44
Wohoo, you gave me some enthusiasm now :)! I will definitely check that out and I know Neo &amp; Bee as I recently wrote an post about them regarding to the Cyprus Central Bank and statement that Bitcoin is not illegal in Cyprus so that will give them surely some wind in the back so I completely agree with you that that is a valuable company to look on to.

It would be really good to talk with people like you, because that is the way where I can learn also and have better arguments as also gain knowledge about how the other party thinks.
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:12:35
Why would you say that? The three of us are trying and developing this app and project and investing our time in this, and as you see we ended up in the finals with several rounds of interviews and selection before? Why then insult us? If you don't like it just ignore...
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:16:11
and opening a bitcoin wallet takes 1 min. "But why didn't you go to try 5 other banks and read 10 other FAQ? absurd..."
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:47:24
Any experience with complying to existing inventory then? I mean if you sell 2 coffees and don't have a standard receipt for but instead you make a bitcoin checkout with the SUM - how do you synchronize between the "regular" system and the bitcoin payments. Don't you end up with irregularities then?
I hope you understood somehow :D
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:41:14
This is actually a great advice! thanks man
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:27:12
It's right on the square behind the big statue. . Once we set this up I'll give you a heads up :). 
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:25:22
I actually did that, and now when I get there with my girl, Im pro bono ;). But I'm asking in a more broader view like... industry view for someone thinking of making a living from this
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:19:08
True, I totally agree with you. And this is why I told him that I can't charge anything here. Well 20 hours is in my "time budget" as I have to write down all the implementation parts, steps. Those are people who heard about bitcoin but don't know anything else. So here is the education, opening wallets, demonstrating all to them. There will surely be some maintainanance in the begining like "Hey this does't work, come check it out" and so on. So I think it is a good estimate :)
And this what you said.. billing a few hours should be ok. I don't know where to look a benchmark for this type of work. How much do others charge their expertise and so on. And of course, me like most of you here is doing this for wider spread of bitcoin and a "greater" good but there comes a point where you have to charge you skills, especially in this way where a business is looking for extra exposure meaning that finally they are there for more profit. :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:18:22
If you read my post, than you would see that I explicitly said that I don't have andy benchmark I would relate to and this is a ROUGH estimate. I already lost one day (Sunday 8-10) hours in crawling throughout the forums, seeing different solutions where there are around 10 that I tried and checked out. You are forgetting that those are people who don't have any knowledge about bitcoin so there will be several more meetings, documentation (guide), education, opening the necessary accounts (wallets, BitPay, QuickBooks maybe?), demonstration, testing and probably some maintenance like “Hey, this doesn’t work like expected, can you come check it out” - which will require for me to commute there, spend time and get back. Probably it wont take me 30 hours (although I added a range from 20-30 so I don't know why people are sticking to the upper limit) more like 10-15, as I just popped the number while I was writing the whole post, not actually making a project plan and estimate before I intended to ask this question. After all this I said this is an investment for me... and I asked how much would you charge in this domain not how much specifically for 30 hours on this specific project... It's more of a general question, hope you understood :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:20:18
In the first place I'm offering my knowledge and skills in the cause of implementing bitcoin on more merchants in Croatia :)
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:40:21
Well I run a regional portal - Croatian Bitcoin Portal, and recently I've come in the position that people are starting to contact me and inquire about this stuff. As much as I like to share knowledge there comes a point where it consumes to much of my time and in the end some of the people that inquire are also here for some added value... of course! And now, a moment has come where my IT background and skills, expertise from this domain should somehow have a ROI, at least on the time I spend learning more in this industry. SO thanks for you insights and comment! :)
@_date: 2015-11-15 21:58:15
Don't know, crypto-currency maybe? :)
I just thought that many new people come here and listen about things like private and public (keys) addresses and cryptography as the backbone on this technology so thought maybe someone not so tech-savvy might be willing to see some basic crypto algos in the whole story
@_date: 2015-11-15 19:57:28
Thanks! Well, I've been developing on meteor since the beginning of summer and now every app/project I do, I take meteor as I want to get the most grip on it. Here I used "crypto.js" and "node-forge" for the algorithms and just "compiled" them all together on meteor. The biggest reason is that I want to sharpen the skills on meteor.js :)
EDIT: About the time - it took about 20hrs more or less, but now when I found out some tricks it could take maybe one weekend(10-12 hours) :)
@_date: 2015-11-15 19:42:18
I just tested it in Chrome and didn't to other browsers yet so there might be some snaps! 
Anyways, I just finished few days ago and hope it can demonstrate a little bit how some crypto algorithms work, or at least what inputs/outputs are needed in those!
@_date: 2015-11-18 09:17:17
Will be after the weekend! :)
