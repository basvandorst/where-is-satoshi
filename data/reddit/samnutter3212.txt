What? A humanistic and rational response to drugs and their place in the arsenal of human medicine?
I love this generation sometimes. 
Keep it up.

At risk of being an edge lord this is just another reason to dislike superstitious, Bronze Age bullshit.

Hi there. Firstly, well done. Truly.
Secondly, whilst I do not work for either charities, I can recommend (both UK)
The David Nott Foundation (a personal hero of mine. A surgeon who works in places like Syria and trains surgeons in absolute hell holes with no doctors left).
The Migraine Trust: I suffer from migraine and have done since the age of 11. Please consider donating something to this organisation which helps people with this widespread but relatively unhighlighted illness.

I so nearly broke the 5 figure mark - I’m talking about £7. And back down a full grand it goes. Fuck’s sakes...

Hitler was *trying to save Germany*?
Mate, what the fuck are you on? Expansionism and racial politics wasn’t saving anyone.
I agree that the War on Drugs is a travesty and one dreamed up by that old crook Nixon but you should choose your comparisons more carefully.

I’m hanging in there. I believe in the technology and I had £14000 of crypto in December. I now have just under £6000.
I’ll be pissed if I sold and it recovered or, even worse, became more and more adopted.
At the end of the day it’s your call. If cashing it in means you’re able to pay your bills then cash it in. If it’s money you don’t *need* back stop checking your portfolio, make a cup of tea, learn an instrument, go outside and stop worrying about things you can’t change. I’ll be right fucking there with you!

Excuse me, I'm new to this. I have money in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin all of which are in my Coinbase wallets. Is this what you recommend or is there something else I need to do here? Thanks.

Will do, thanks man.

This. Though perversely the misinformation may boost confidence in crypto...
