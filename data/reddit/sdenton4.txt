*Basically, the author see's alot of bitcoiner's holding bitcoin and not spending it, then wrongly believes the same thing will happen if a merchant does not accept bad money(fiat).*
I see people holding bitcoin because of its deflationary nature.  It's all well and good that you're up for buying milk and eggs with bitcoin, but how much milk and eggs do you need?  The tendency with delationary currencies is to concentrate in large pools held by people who can get away with spending a minimal amount of their pool, while poorer people are forced by their necessities to spend a larger proportion of their pool of currency.  This means that large holders of the currency become sinks, as they have fewer things they need to spend on and will naturally want a bigger pile of gold to pass on to their three-year-old daughter.
In fact, there was a massive bullion problem in the middle ages in Europe caused precisely by the tendency to gold to accumulate at such sinks.  In the end, it led to lots of people resorting to credit and local currencies, which in turn caused trade to break down.  Boats of goods would show up at port, but no one would have bullion to pay for the goods, and they would head back home profitless.
(The Wikipedia article on the 1920-21 recession seems rather less bullish than you are: Deflation happened during a recession and the 'roaring' part of the twenties occurred during/after the recovery.  Deflation during the thirties was also not fun, or so I hear.)
You're certainly right, though, that a deflationary currency can be fine to trade other currencies against, much as the local currencies in the middle ages (and the old american dollar) were typically expressed in relation to gold.  The question then is whether bitcoin will actually be used in this capacity in the long run.
