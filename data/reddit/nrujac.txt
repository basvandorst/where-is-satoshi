This doesn't hold the way you think it does. Here's a trivial example:
    2 = 2
    2 + 1 = 2     // obviously invalid proof step
    3 != 2 so reject the hypothesis, 2 != 2
Said another way, failure to prove is not the same as proof of the negative. In this case, your S is really "Craig signs a message with Satoshi's key" and P is "Craig controls Satoshi's key". But we don't have !P. We have a failed proof of the implication.
(I should also say that it's fairly clear that Wright likely does not control the key, but it's not modus tollens that gets us there)

Right, I'm saying that this isn't strictly (obviously, axiomatically) true. There may be some convoluted reason (possibly/probably illogical) for which he chooses not to sign the message.
I agree we have evidence of absence. And I agree it's strong evidence. But evidence alone is not a mathematical proof.


There isn't too much to expand. I was just trying to make the point that an invalid proof is not the same as a proof of the negative hypothesis. From your original post: 




You're applying modus tollens by moving the proof into the propositions themselves. My example shows how this goes wrong:
     
    S = "I want to prove 2 = 2"
    P = "I prove it via the method shown"
    S implies P, P is obviously false, therefore !S.

That's exactly the right answer. No passwords are exchanged, just the public key.
