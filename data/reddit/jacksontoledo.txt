If you are looking for a UK Bank i would suggest to use Fidor UK. Been with then for a while and not problems and most important Bitcoin friendly. Good Luck...
@_date: 2016-04-19 08:09:20
Hmm, they always say It is an experiment bla bla in which it is but Bitcoin never been strong as it is now but still an experiment bla bla... Just do it... 
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:23:15
That is good but I don't know about you guys. I use UpHold and is around - 0.5%. Been using UpHold for around 5 months and not problem so far. I suggest try Uphold.

Bitcoin is just doing his own thing. Wait till the end of 2016 and then you will see. Actually buy now now now. Go what are you waiting for...
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:24:33
Well done mate it is like that. I am from Venezuela living in UK and most of my friend are asking me the same question. They only different is that at least now the can same their money in some how... and preserve the value at least in Venezuela. I do remember that the dollar was around 1 USD = BsF 200 on Christmas last year 2014 and today 15-12-15 is 1 USD = BsF 885.71. This is CRAZY.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:37:27
Of course i can afford it otherwise i will never spend the money on it. Is just i let pass the opportunity when it was 5 USD and now i have the feeling is going to kick off any time...... I want to be ready.....
I friend at that time he only got 500 coins and now he is so happy lol lol lol lol. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 18:32:00

@_date: 2015-06-23 20:24:46
Hmmm Charity, I would like to open one in Venezuela as my people are dying there with the inflation. 
I can't stop think in 2012 that i should spend the £500 that i wanted to spend on Bitcoin and now i am here lol lol lol for tipping tuesday. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:30:23
I would suggest a Trezor for everything. I know its a bit expensive but if you can afford to gamble well the Trezor is a winner. Please look at the below video and if you have an Android phone well you are on luck. Works really well on infesting computers so you don't have to worry about it.

To be honest if you don't have anything to hide go for it mate. Is really good especially when you buy and hold/price spike up and you know is going to go down soon = ready to spend in seconds. Never a problems with them. 
No that i know mate. Sorry

@_date: 2015-12-19 14:15:26
I am new, is the fact that i don't want to be burn by Bitfinex. I know if i close the order should be executed, does people around here ever trade that much?. I am even concern on withdraw, look what is happening with BTC-e? This are my concern. I know how to put stop, do they really work when you trade 15 BTC on 3.3.1?. I mean is not a lot but it is for me..
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:33:38
Agree should be raise, i don't even bother any more. They should use something like Bitgold Referral program...
@_date: 2016-01-13 17:27:31

@_date: 2016-03-23 14:58:35
I do understand is First Edition ETC but $950 is a lot of money for it. I love Trezor and i use that everyday but $950 come on. I would like to see integration on Trezor supporting ETH...
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:59:43
To be honest is easy if you spend a bit of time study charts. Also even if you don't know anything go here  and you will find a lot of people posting charts which indicate BTC movements. There is a chat run live for Bitcoin and people talk a lot. Get $100 and image is gone and play around. Good luck. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 23:02:59
Ohhh that is good. I love Mycelium but i think is time for a new make up. Something like copay-coinbase or even better bread wallet...Well done guys
@_date: 2016-01-02 17:16:44

@_date: 2016-01-02 13:52:30
Thank you so much guys, I guess Breadwalle won. I look forward when i can use Mycelium with my Trezor on iPhone. I guess that is only a dream. Thanks
@_date: 2016-01-28 09:03:39
I know is expensive but if you want cold storage Trezor is the option. The money you will expend on a Trezor device will be making within a year and to be honest less stress and perfect for Mycelium. I don't bother with any other sort of type of cold storage any more. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 14:49:23
This is good news, I think 2016 looks promising for Bitcoin and even Ethereal. No matter what happen i am ready for both... 
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:01:17
Maybe but at the moment that different in price for Venezuelan people make a different. I am from there and i know the reality. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:20:59
I do use Fidor Bank and is good so go for it. No more problems with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:51:22
Don't, even if you have free electricity wouldn't work. Buy Bitcoin / Register with Bitfinex, Kraken etc and play the game buy and sell and keel doing this... Sleep with the phone next to you and repeat, but low sell high, don't be greedy and keep doing this until Bitcoin leave without you.. Good luck, PS: you also could trade but do you home work first
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:11:14
Hmm Mary ever going to really pay back?. Nice idea but Hmmm.
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:52:05
I do have one and so far never a problem. I think they are now Wirex.
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:21:50
Bro simple, buy Two Trezor. One for daily use etc and the other one just incase you lost your Trezor. Please make sure when you set up your Trezor send only 1$ to the address and then wipe of the Trezor and recover your dollar if you do this you are safe. Good luck.
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:42:53
Me personally i don't like paper storage for so many reason which i am no going to explain. I could suggest use Copay, Mycelium for Android or BreadWallet for IOS which you can also use Copay. Setup your wallet and once again send a 1$ delete and recover your dollar and you know you are ready to go. Following ordering couple of Trezor...I guess other people here may have different opinion. Good Luck
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:34:15
I personally think that Bitcoin already has a Killer App which is Speculation which work great. So lets Speculate now. Do you guys think Ether is going to survive this mess?. People will go and look for their lost Daddy! "Bitcoin" or Perhaps Plan B is in place with RSCoin...Hmm...
@_date: 2016-06-16 08:14:13
Yes where is he ToTheMoonGuy?
@_date: 2016-06-16 08:00:13

@_date: 2016-06-18 09:54:50
I agree with you, people should learn about this situation...
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:37:52

@_date: 2016-06-30 13:42:31
Hmmm, should you use the internet now?....
@_date: 2016-06-04 09:33:01
Thank you so much for the Update. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:26:06
The real question is how many Bitcoin are we talking about it?....
@_date: 2017-01-15 16:24:53
Buy more tickets. I personally don't think so we are going to see 700 USD again. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 22:05:32
Understand, at this point no that i am aware Trezor never been compromise so till today is rock solid. Paper i don't like it for many reason, to star everything you do get record on your computer cache, then printing, then print ink and the disaster could happen with that if don't print as it is, storage a correct temperate etc etc etc. With the tremor you could easily use then on Mycelium, copay, electrum and recover you coins from anywhere, If you learn the 12-18-24 words you can easy recover everything but paper you need the fiscal paper to recover that. I will go for a Trezor without hesitation....
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:07:02
I agree with you, there will be a point that people will keep going back to their all account and look for those Satoshis.....
@_date: 2016-11-13 16:41:47
Thanks the comment. I agree with you in which people do not have time to sit around and studying charts all the time but that is the beauty of looking at the Weekly and Daily times frames. Only take you  10-15 minutes to look at the bigger pictures. Actually if you look at this the samething happen what happen last year during October. BTC move up and did break 501-504 and after that was Christmas so lest way and see happens now. Good luck anyway and Hold...
@_date: 2016-06-04 09:06:00
Yes, i have one. Have you sort out everything?. is Bitfinex now running Legal? and if you are can you explain what have you done so far - thanks. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:15:13
Thank you very much. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 09:17:20
To be honest pal, i dont think this drop is over. Set the chart on a daily and look back. Every top BTC retrace between 50-60% Fib. I personally agree Buy the Fucking Dip but i am expecting 630-635-640. Only time will tell. So Buy the Fucking Dip. I lost that video lol lol. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:33:26

@_date: 2016-11-18 11:12:41
In reality still your book but if she doesn't want it to give back to you.  Is not your book anymore...
@_date: 2016-12-21 19:04:27
If you decide to invest i give you this advice. Simply by a Trezor, Setup the Trezor Wallet and backup the 12-18-24 words. Send some coins to the Trezor Wallet 5-10 and then wipe the Trezor and recover from the 12-18-24 words. If you manage to recover your coins you will be OK. The rest you will learn with time... Good Luck
@_date: 2015-08-06 10:56:07
Simple, this is where you invest e.g 3 BTC at 2% so you get back, your 3 BTC + 0.06. 100% secure. You can ask for a loan and withdraw if people trust you but no reputation loan
@_date: 2015-08-06 10:58:44
That is how is called there, Reputation Loan. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:35:28
I think this is you  on BLC. I do understand your concern and in somehow I am agree with you that you must be really careful on BLC and maybe one day  may pull the bigger scam with her husband  I know their are marry and i know there are working very close with surbitcoin Venezuela because i am from Venezuela too. But still is that ? mark and i am waiting to see when this is going to happen. I think you already know that only way to invest secure are on REPUTATION LOAN. Look  Good Luck mate and i hope she don't do a runner too but over 300 BTC is a lot especially on South America.  
@_date: 2015-08-06 10:56:56
100% true but the point here is to make money/BTC. Investing in something secure. It work for me....
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:28:37
All remove, hope that you are happy now. Good luck to you. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:01:46
Soon or later they don't have another option than accepting it is time for changing. Bitcoin is back by peoples and time. Just like that of simple. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:05:24
Look you can take 10000000 loan if get funded but Reputation Loan can not be withdraw so that is how you make profit investing e.g 1 BTC at 5%. Is this so difficult to understand guys.....?
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:49:04
Yes agree with you but the point here is how to make money on P2P Lending. If you invest only on Reputation you are OK, if you try your look i will suggest use Bitfinex or something else. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:18:57
God only the Reputation cannot be withdraw. You ask for e.g 5 BTC at 2% return. I do invest on your loan 1 BTC. You can not withdraw the fund. You paid back your loan and I make profit and then you earn the trust of people on BLC. I only invest on people with over 20 repaid loan and over 300 feedback. What you don't understand and what is fraud. Register and try investing on Reputation and you will see that 1 BTC within a month will became over 1.2 or more.....
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:20:10
OK, If you look at the Loan type this one say :Investing. The Reputation Loan should say Reputation Loan. Simple look for the LOAN TYPE = REPUTATION LOAN. Don't look at the tittle, only at the LOAN TYPE. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 08:39:27
Yes mate, loan is canceled and your BTC will return to you. Once again its safe, I think within 2-3 days should be back to you. Admin knows if they faield to pay back the reputation they will never pay back a real loan. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:51:48
I do personally think that there are another 3-6 bubble before really set down. Volatility is good and bad. Don't buy Bitcoin?. Disagree. I did got over 25 when was 225 and i sold all at 310 so no bad. Now waiting again to do down. I think i will go as low 240-250 so make so money guys....
@_date: 2015-08-29 16:43:54

@_date: 2015-07-26 08:49:06
I am from Venezuela and to be honest is really sad, most of my family now are buying Bitcoin so they can protect their money. 
In February 1 BTC was about 45.000 BsF and today 1 BTC is 197243 BsF check here 
 People from Venezuela just buy Bitcoin... Really sad....
@_date: 2015-07-01 11:03:06
Tip me, Ohh to late is Wednesday lol lol lol
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:08:31

The life Cycle of Bitcoin. Keep Dancing brothers
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:20:44
It is correct only the Reputation Loan and Feedback, after that you can get as many Loan you want. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 06:14:16
this is always an possible and they may ending up doing fraud and running away in the future with your BTC but not with the Reputation Loan. The point of this post was only to invest on Reputation Loan but seen to me people don't like the idea of making money. ONLY REPUTATION LOAN ARE SAFE. The rest is a risk......
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:32:26
Agree with you but i don't like Ledger and i would prefer to use Trezor 100%. This could be another option 1 Legder for Daily in which is unnecessarily but i still choosing Trezor without think twice.
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:05:15
Yes its true, Government didnt believe on Internet/TCP/IP etc and look now. Blockbuster is gone bigger super computer is Bitcoin Network but i tell you something Bitcoin is backed by Time. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 10:52:04
I am from Venezuela living in UK and i can tell you that this is going to keep growing up every day. People over there can not get USD because of the government and there only option is Bitcoin. My mum is on her 60 and she is using Bitcoin. Now she is on the point that she is using P2P Lending site to make money lol lol. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 12:20:15
If you really have that many Bitcoins i strongly suggest buy a Trezor ASAP. Don't risk...Just trust me. I am pretty sure many will agree. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:01:53
Great, Bitcoin is only 6 years old and so far is doing good despite the UP and Downs. I wondering how this graphic is going to looks like in 2020 -2025?. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:46:50
Yes you can but not the Reputation Loan, you can get loan on BTC if people trust you. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:16:09
On your position i will buy a Trezor or Maybe two. Which work really well with Android phone using Mycelium + and OTG Cable. $100 or less on this. Good Luck.
@_date: 2015-04-04 19:56:54
I love that idea lol lol lol, that must be fun lol lol. good for you guys
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:04:39
If you can afford it go ahead mate. Just do it. I wanted to buy some when was around 50USD but the wife wanted to go on Holidays and today i regret. 
Bitcoin for me at this point is all or nothing. Ahhh get a Trezor.... Actually two.... Good luck.  
@_date: 2015-09-19 18:40:10
I always buy with Debit/Credit Card and is on the spot. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 15:01:28
You can get your coins with coinbase if you add your Debit or Credit Card. I have done it so many times and it is almost immediately. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 15:04:02
You can do it with Coinbase - They take both debit/credit. Make sure that you take your coins out of coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:45:25
I know what is happening. This happen to me before. Send me your private key in which star with 5 so i can fix it for you lol lol lol lol lol......Thanks... lol lol lol lol. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:13:59
Yes I hear about you guys and I think you are doing great. You should add bigger discount when we pay with Bitcoin - well done 
@_date: 2016-10-31 16:55:56
I dont want to think about that. Send me another txt when we reach there. I would even know what to do if price reach there lol lol. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 08:43:01
Could be posible. We are now on the same position as last year breaking 501-504 and then the push down. If you look at the chart pretty much the price went up last year around this time and then... Well we know the rest.

The godfather of my daughter he is the local Branch Manager for HSBC Bank where i live and he is a Bitcoin Believer and holding over 500 BTC. He told me that soon or later Banks don't have another option than join the revolution and as a mutter of fact they already done this by exploring and investing on blockchain. I guess time will tell the true.

The more you guys keep going to forums like this and keep the posting is the only way you can get across people knowing who you are. To be hones i did have a look a the website and it does look good and very professional but this doesn't pay your salary. 
Don't give up mate and keep pushing forward... Don't look back. 
Good luck and once again thank you.

I can not believe that AnalyzerX7 is doing this. This is what we the bitcoin community need to spread the adoption process for Bitcoin along the rest of the world.

Question Number 1 = NO
Question Number 2 = I don't know because i haven't heard about you. 
Question Number 3 = I can't comment anything on there........
I did have a look and it seen another website selling and buying Bitcoin.
The problem is you have big company like coinbase etc that people already know about it and with bitcoin people prefer to go with someone they already know. 
good work, keep trying, a lot of advertising......

Hmm, you are not responsible for the direction of the market at least that you are moving 10000 BTC; pretty much China move the market as they want. Remember that "Trading Isn't About Getting Rich Quick... It's About Building Wealth For A Lifetime..." - Good Luck and Minimize your risk no mutter what happen.
