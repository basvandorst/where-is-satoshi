I haven't had contact with the customer. I sit here, colleagues from the marketing dept. come over to my desk and tell me 'here, take this, fix it, has pictures he wants to keep'. I do research, and discover it's slain by a cryptolocker variant. I tried to come up with a solution and thought that bitcoin transactions were seen in public as soon as they were made, but not 'valid' until accepted by 6. (or 3.. not sure?). So I fire up a question on reddit. A question indicates I don't know the answer, right? So I ask for help, not stating I know the answer. I even stated I am not experienced with bitcoin. Now please excuse my ignorance.

And what exactly makes it required to be experienced in cryptocurrency if you're an IT guy? Really weak statement you bring up here. That's like saying your go-to-car-mechanic should be experienced in mounting an intake for a Boeing.

We gave shadow volume a shot but there were no viable results. Pretty sad to see. The customer's computer contained photo's of passed away family members so I'm desperate to find a way to trick the system, because he's willing to pay the bitcoins but that's only going to support the cyberrats.

Just because your car go-to is an experienced mechanic does not mean he should immediately know how to mount an intake on an airplane. Just because I am an IT-guy does not mean I should immediately know how cryptocurrency works in-depth. Being experienced in a field doesn't mean one can assure he's experienced with whatever's even remotely related.

Where did I, in the first place, state that I were an experienced IT guy? Where did I say that I have been working in the IT sector for years? Where did I say I am even of legal age? For the love of god pack your stuff and piss off. And no worries pal, I do get educated. That's why I am currently taking internship at an IT corp to get educated. Retry.

Yeah I wasn't too sure if they did, that's why I was giving this an attempt. I assume they do though, so that renders it practically impossible now.

That's an interesting link. Let me give that a shot!
Edit: bummer, it only takes cryptolocker and not cryptowall :( Thanks for your input though!

We took a full disk image before tinkering indeed. He had taken no backups and we failed to recover any of his files sadly. They allow one free file decryption though, but that's only going to recover one photo... And yeah, who knows. That'd be seriously great!

Well, the decryption happens on their servers which I need to access over a TOR address. Otherwise it'd be definitely a possibility!

What if the customer simply wasn't aware what's possible nowadays in the world of computers? I mean, you can't accuse him of being a cheapskate if he had no idea this could occur. Most people know things can die and break and crash, but if he isn't your average computer user who knows the default stuff he simply could've not been aware of the risks in this cruel tech world.

I'll fire up an isolated VM and see if I can get infected (I think I traced where they got infected from) to be able to capture the packets. I'm not sure if they RSA pub key is embedded into the resources of the executable but if it contacts a server, maybe it's as simple as 'GET /getpubkey/8f3js9', which maybe also has 'getprivkey' ;)
I'll get back with the results.
Edit: capture file when I ran it can be found here:  for those interested
