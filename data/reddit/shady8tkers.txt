I find that if you have your penis out and you say, "I'm having the sex with you."  When the girl freaks out, I just ask, "Oh, you don't take my penis?"  Then I pull out my credit cards and cash and suddenly they're interested.

Man, I know you're in a tough spot.  But it does sound delusional when you say, "I just think my time is better spent doing what i do best, which is trading and analyzing markets."
You have $55K left of $300K...Do the math.
I know you want someone to tell you that the market will turn around and in X number of months BTC will be at $1000 or more.  NO ONE CAN DO THAT.  If someone does, be VERY SKEPTICAL of their advice.
If you have the experience trading FX and BTC and doing analysis, then YOU already know everything that people are telling you in this post.  Yet, you keep hanging on to whatever past "successes" you had that, in the long run, did not help you financially.  I understand that you may have made a few gains, but if you were honest with yourself and looked at your journal or ledger of trades to calculate your win /loss percentage, I think that you'll see that it's not as good as you think it is.
No one can tell you what you want to hear.  I don't know what a good answer is when you've gambled with money you couldn't afford to lose.  If you hadn't done that, the answer would have been easy. because your own stops would have provided the answer a long time ago and you would not be in this situation.
Some of your "ideas," such as switching and taking a short position, make me realize that your title is correct...you are desperate.  The reason why is because you want someone to tell you what to do because you know that you've lost control and have no idea what to do.  You can't blame the irrational market.  You are the only one being irrational based on your post.
What I worry about is that you didn't have permission to be doing what you're doing.  I hope that's not the case.   
I believe bitcoin and the blockchain technology have great potential and will one day be more valuable than the current $350.  I don't know what the current forces are that are affecting the price.  I'm not sure anyone does.  The issue for you is time.  If you had the time, I would say STOP "investing" (which is you just gambling with your family's money) and wait for the price to recover.
Like I said before, I'm not sure what to do since you've invested money you could not afford to lose.

Man, thank you for the tip!   I'm never one to not appreciate the kindness of strangers, but let me tell you how this went down.  
I excitedly redeemed the tip and then sent it to my phone wallet.  I then rushed in to change into my best "strip club" going outfit. (Ass-less chaps and a bow tie.)  I got to the club and as I was walking towards the front door, I opened the hot wallet app on my phone.  I held my phone directly in front of me at arms length and then, like an FBI Agent showing his credentials, I thrusted it to within a quarter inch of the bouncer's face and said, "Bitcoin motherfucker, step aside."
I actually don't have any independent recollection of this.  I'm am putting together what happened based on the security camera footage that the bouncer posted on YouTube and the accounts of the police officers who were laughing while telling the hospital staff what happened.
The next thing I know is I'm waking up in the hospital.  Apparently, the jealous bouncer punched me square in the face.  I was out cold before I ever hit the ground. (According to Koko and Michelle who were on their smoke break.). I'm ok though.  My pride is just hurt a little bit....I've never been hit that hard by a woman before. 
So, I never got to buy a pole dance with my BTC, but there's always next time.

What you are pointing out is a hind-sighted view of the market.  This will not help you make buying and selling decisions once your in.  It will also not help you make timing decisions on when to enter the market.
What your advice is missing is an examination and understanding of the fundamentals, human psychology and an understanding of and the application of technical analysis.

Even if he had a business set up.  Plus, he's not doing the second example you gave.  It's not anonymous.  He's taking a known person's property and putting it into a decorative form then mailing it back to them.
Plus, I don't believe my hypothetical friend, or Mike fit the definition of a Money Transmitter as defined under 31 USC 5330...Just read about what the BTC coin company was doing and then look at this definition.  Also consider the spirit of this statute.
(d) Definitions.— For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) Money transmitting business.— The term “money transmitting business” means any business other than the United States Postal Service which—
(A) provides check cashing, currency exchange, or money transmitting or remittance services, or issues or redeems money orders, travelers’ checks, and other similar instruments or any other person who engages as a business in the transmission of funds, including any person who engages as a business in an informal money transfer system or any network of people who engage as a business in facilitating the transfer of money domestically or internationally outside of the conventional financial institutions system;;  [1]

The problem I see here is that your coins are too close to the door.   I know every time you shut the freezer door, the coins fall forward and then fall out and onto the floor the next time you open the door. 
You're going to end up losing them under the fridge.  Then you'll be posting on here in a year how you "used" to have 3 BTC but lost them and now you regret it because everyone else is on the moon and you're just sitting there masturbating with your Baby Ruth ice cream.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:57:55

I made the analogy yesterday that this was like me sending my friend a $100 bill so that he could fold it into an intricate origami bird because I love those fucking things.  I love them so much that I pay him $10 to do this because I can't even fold my damn socks.  Then he mails my beautiful fucking origami bird back to me.  Per FinCEN, my bird making friend would be a money transmitter.

Yeah, this is what I'm worried about.  I would love to arb Coinbase and Mt. Gox...buy for $30-$50 cheaper with level 2 instant (10 coins a week) on CB then send to Mt. Gox and sell there for a quick $300-$500.
But then I couldn't get my money out.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:39:54
I would second that...but add that, if you are in BTC, maybe pick up a few cheap coins here in the next few days.

@_date: 2013-12-13 13:44:36
Yeah, my real concern is that this is actually the fat cat bankers manipulating the strings of their Federal puppets at FinCEN.  I know it sounds like I've been drinking Jesse Ventura's Kool-Aid, but just think about how many crooks and fraudsters in Wall Street got IN ANY trouble over the mortgage and/or financial crisis!?
@_date: 2013-12-28 19:23:37
You have to understand, many of the down-voters on Reddit who downvote a post like yours are nothing but neck-bearded, immature, basement dwelling losers who have no life, girlfriend or friends.  All they have is the anonymity of the internet to hide behind.  If you were standing in front of them, they would be so shy and reserved because of their low self esteem and bad acne, that they wouldn't even be able to talk.
Your concern is legitimate and it's discouraging that this happened with such a new technology that we are all hoping catches on.   Please keep us informed as to what happens and what you are told by the merchant(s) involved.  I for one am very interested in the outcome of this.
Good luck !

It tool me about 2 weeks to get my account verified.  I made my first purchase on Dec. 3rd and am supposed to have the coins on Dec 9th.  They have withdrawn the money from my bank account and that part of the transaction shows as "COMPLETED" with a tracking # assigned.  So I hope that is good news.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:39:29
Mine took 2 weeks.  Coinbase is experiencing massive growth and, remember, they are not part of the banking system, so they have to submit their transactions to the Automated Clearing House (ACH) to do the deposit.  This takes time.  I know it's hard watching the price go down and not being able to buy, but there will be more dips in the future when you are able to buy.
Coinbase has been a very positive experience for me.  Just be patient as all of us are getting in on this in the early stages.  
And remember, once your account is linked and you make your first purchase, you CAN NOT make another purchase until the first one has completed the entire process.  This can take from 4 days to a week depending on traffic and the market.  So make your first purchase count!

Mmmm...a $70,000+ transaction and you're asking how to do it?  Sounds like either you're making this up or you seriously need to educate yourself.  Do some reading and learn about bitcoin and the process.  If you did, there really shouldn't be a need to ask how you get started.
Search and read through some of the posts here.  Be responsible so you don't get taken advantage of.  And know that you can lose everything also.

I can only speak for Coinbase, which does experience some problems with high volume.  I have never experienced it personally, but have read several people complaining about it.
I have also read that it occurs on other platforms as well.
