You have to admit, you and  are the outliers in your age brackets.  Majority are to scared or not tech savy enough to venture into the crypto world....which leads to the subject line of it being a ponzi or whatever else they want to say negatively about crypto to make themselves feel better.

might be better to show Tx per day over time as a growth indicator - but not sure why there's a drastic difference in confirmed tx per day and total number of transactions

Appreciate it... I'm just trying to show the growth trend of wallet addresses over time
@_date: 2019-07-24 19:47:50

Propaganda by the gub to create FUD and hysterical sell offs from the crypto nubs.

I think the OP's intent is to leave Coinbase all together after their horrid service over the past few weeks with the influx of newcomers.

I sent another 7,500 to help pay for a small fee to move his money as well.  No sweat, he's going to reward me with a few million for my assistance.

We'll send in non-profit cryptocurrencies in to assist with the little baby bitcoins and restore and legitimize the new replacement blockchain technology government.

@_date: 2017-11-06 16:04:33
