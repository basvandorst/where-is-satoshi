Itbit.com seems a fair option for HK as well.

Technically it can only go up or down, so only half of them can be wrong ��

How is this btc related and not marketing another ico?

Seems to work fine, just walked through the entire process. On the first page you choose whether you had claimed before, online or offline. Later you’ll update security (2FA mandatory) and even get your balances shown. You can even choose whether you prefer settlement in cash or btc. Very solid process.

Please look at BTCPAYSERVER it’s fantastic, easy to deploy and no middleman needed.

Hi, the BTCServer acts as a node but his main purpose is BTC payment flow processing onsite or via module on a variety of shopping carts. So I am not sure what you try to achieve exactly. You can connect your node to BTCPayserver, yes. 
Nodes are simple network relays and verify input to the blockchain. So if you goal is payment processing you can host BTCPayserver yourself or use any of the out of the box solutions like Lunanode and connect your node. 
We had setup self hosted BTCPayserver before without using the docker image which works well. But given its rapidly developing missing a „one click update“ seemed not feasible and we went back to the docker image installation. Hope that helps?

Hi, there are quite a few good options now offering online and/ or POS checkout options. If you “just” want to add BTC as am option to accept and directly convert into USD you might look into BitPay, Coingate or Coinbase. If you are here to support the case or use BTC without the central control of a company have a look at BTCPayserver which is a open source BitPay Copy that’s surprisingly easy to setup and run without the need of a middle-man.

BtcPayserver isn’t complicated at all to setup, use the LunaNoda Hosting for a test and you’ll be surprised how easy that works. Self-installation isn’t recommended as you wouldn’t have the option to update it easy.

Same here actually. Took around a week, some KYC had to be redone (picture of ID in hand) after that was done it took another 3 or 4 days. They failed to actively inform about threshold changes twice in a short time span and that applied for existing customers, to me that is very bad customer experience.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:38:44
Can only speak for myself and have not received any information on this prior or after change which I found rather odd and made me withdraw. Other emails from them (2fa, withdrawal, kyc request) regularly received.

Within the last 2 months they reduced Tier 1 for btc (6.2% APY) from 20 to 10 and now 5 BTC. Result is the exceeding amount in Tier 2 gets 2.2% APY. Without any notification this means a broken customer promise that you’d had to figure out yourself. Not building trust that way.

In addition you’ll find a couple public available BTCPayserver installations to use (some free) on the projects main website, this could help to try it out without even setting up your own BTCPayserver. Please make sure to verify whether that suits your purpose as they might not be around for long or charge a fee at some point.

When sending stock to Amazon you can choose to either mingle or not mingle stock. It’s a setting in your SellerCentral Account. If the item has a serial ID (not sure about Tresor) you can as well prevent mingling based on SKU Level Serial required “yes”. Sorry to hear you had such bad experience as that is certainly not what it was build for.

I saw an incredibly intelligent young man who refused falling into rhetorical question with simple answers to complex problems. I saw the same young man fighting for the one and true believe he has, security. 
I saw another man repeating kind of misleading numbers and kind of word twisted quotes to try to proof his view to an extend that it got boring, kind of too obviously prepared arguments on repeat. 
Maybe that discussion showed a problem of our society between fast and simple answers and the actual complexity of solving problems in a consensus driven group. 
It also showcased the fine line between moderation and censorship in a world where a noise level is often mistaken for a the majority voice. 
I also saw some some wining girls in the background, like someone took their toys��
Investing two hours watching this wasn’t bad, at all. If I’d had to do business with either Juan or Roger it would likely be Juan to be honest.

Yes for a given amount it is. Look at bit4coin.net where the combination of phone number and bank transfer buys you €500 without registration. Netherlands are quite forward with btc in many ways and bit4coin gets around many of the btc problems by issues an alphanumeric-voucher in € which can later be redeemed against btc withdrawal to any wallet. They charge 5.9% i believe but are very successful, imagine the customer who want to buy something with btc doesn't have to worry a lot fluctuation at all.

Any merchant service requires kyc, otherwise there is no way to have access to fiat banking. If you are "just" processing there is gourl.io with fair API and costs. If you need a finished solution without kyc there is coingate with very nice code yet as the option to keep all funds btc only without the need of kyc. However the moment you want to transfer into fiat or withdraw anything but btc you go through full kyc. It's money laundry law to have kyc above certain amounts.

Bit4coin.net has a physical gift card that looks quite cool but it is in Eur

Mandatory safety delay, happens quite often. You can cancel and try to split amounts until you do not get the delay message or go through some kyc (scan of id and selfie) to release funds right away. Unusual behavior triggers that and it is supposed to be a security feature. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:29:13
buy.bitcoin.com, buy.coingate.com (both use simplex which is expensive but works, kyc required incl. holding the card into a camera)

True, as far as I know the US is the only country practicing non-resident taxation based on citizenship and forcing banks around the world helping using facta. Taxing a non-resident (an US Expat living and paying taxes anywhere else in the world) just doesn't seem to make sense, which is probably why no other country known to me at least does it?

Thank you ����

They don’t need any verification as long as you do not need fiat conversation, literally can use a new email for a new account, new api key and let the old account be for good?
