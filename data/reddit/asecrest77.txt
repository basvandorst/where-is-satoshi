The very fuel that started this all.... the Government lol
@_date: 2019-07-28 04:45:46
Hahaha bro... same. I got into it because the government is trash... little did I know going into bitcoin, that it is the very reason most of us are here.
@_date: 2019-07-30 06:21:54
Is it me or.... mainstream financial outlets have been pretty bullish recently in regards to btc... that last run probably woke allot of people up, including myself. not gonna lie, I first got into bitcoin as a short seller, but the more research I did, the more aware I became about how revolutionary this technology is and it turned me into a bull ��
@_date: 2019-07-28 06:19:34
Hahahahaha damn... touché

Allot of main stream/older investors don’t like just buying crypto cause it’s risky. Someone like myself who started with stocks, people are very very interested, but never got involved due to market uncertainty and the massive amount of scams involved. They’re targeting the paranoid main stream crowd. I on the other hand said fuck it and just bought
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:02:47
I actually view this as a flaw...

Not your keys, not your bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-01 02:23:30
Lmao bruh... nubs always get shook during price corrections lol I love it. Gives me time to accumulate more
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:37:57
Supply and demand... lol I mean, theoretically they could, but they’d end up spending a fuck load more. I’d consider it to be like a “hostile takeover” when buying stock, but less people would be keen to sell btc
@_date: 2019-08-04 08:35:22
I would have given it back too tbh. He was straight up with you, didn’t try ripping you off so why fuck the guy over.
@_date: 2019-08-03 06:34:45
Banks have somewhat tried this w/ credit cards... and failed lol
@_date: 2019-08-03 20:22:02
Wow... all I have to say is... wow ����‍♂️ I’m sure there’s allot of kids here that are naive, but DO NOT DONATE TO ANY DEMOCRAT. I’m not a republican either, so don’t even try... the Democratic Party wants the polar opposite of what crypto currency is aiming to do. They’re for the centralization of government. They’re for UBI, higher taxes, universal healthcare, mandatory minimum wage, gun control, and all around more government interference in every day life. If you think I’m wrong than you’re just a naive clueless kid.

Taxation is theft. They don’t

Yea.. I feel like we’re forced to choose either communism or fascism lmao I just want to mind my own business, shoot guns, bang lines and fuck whores... just like the founding fathers intended
@_date: 2019-08-04 02:43:13
Lol I may have over exaggerated the “evil” aspect, but I agree to an extent. Cheers ����

Because it’s not sustainable and actually lowers the quality standard. Also in America you’re free to pay how ever much you want to fight disease or get whatever surgery you very well please. In countries with universal healthcare the government can dictate what surgeries you receive or what diseases you fight based on odds of survival and cost efficiency. It happens far too often actually. For example, if you’re terminally ill and there is a treatment that may or may not extended your life if it’s successful, government can refuse the treatment even if you’re willing and want to fight it. There is a reason people come to America for certain surgeries... the over all quality is much higher here because it’s not mandated by the government... which governments notoriously cut corners and budget terribly
@_date: 2019-08-05 02:26:09
Think of it as a unit of measurement. Gold is traded by the Ounce, but you can also go out and buy grams. Think of 1BTC as the standard unit of measurement similar to 1 ounce.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:03:53
Why don’t you just sell for a stable coin and hold them?
@_date: 2019-08-04 22:20:08
I use coinomi. It supports almost every coin and is secure
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:20:26
Wow.. you people are clueless ����‍♂️ I hope you understand bitcoin and this clown contradict one another
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:13:06
Not your coinzzz BOI
@_date: 2019-08-03 08:19:13
Your best bet is to use a paper wallet. I recommend buying a house in a low lying area that’s prone to flooding. Deposit your life savings into a paper wallet. (This part is important) DO NOT BACK IT UP!! You wanna make sure you own the only copy. After funds are deposited, place it in your sock drawer and forget. This is how you achieve financial freedom... btw. You owe me 5 payments of $420.69 for my program.
@_date: 2019-08-09 07:51:34
Lmao blame good old Bill Clinton and the government for that mess.
@_date: 2019-08-04 02:14:14
Very true... lmao
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:47:10
YES!! I’m a die hard libertarian/AnCap and that’s why I love bitcoin. I share allot of the same beliefs the cypher punks that created bitcoin. One this that does piss me off...  Crypto attracts naive kids.
@_date: 2019-08-04 02:17:18
I too also took profits on my pot to buy bitcoin lmao my three favorite investments... precious metals, the devils lettuce and.. Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:25:51
Reddit is for the birds. All I see are 16 year old kids confusing socialism with libertarianism and it’s trash.
@_date: 2019-08-04 02:13:46
I gotcha.. but with a pretty good understanding of history and economics, I can say with the utmost confidence that the liberal ideology is dangerous. It’s dangerous because the underlying intentions are good, yet the policy is destructive. Surveys on college students have shown that the majority of left leaning students majored in philosophy and arts while the right or even libertarian students studied economics and finance. This is dangerous because the people who push for leftist policies have good intentions, yet lack a real understanding of economics. They push for laws which sound good on paper, but they neglect to account for the repercussions. It’s dreamers vs realists
@_date: 2019-08-09 07:54:09
Don’t even bother. College is a scam and once you graduate and realize you never truly needed a degree, you’ll be pissed lol for example, JPM isn’t even looking at college grads for invest bankers. The market is so diluted with people holding degrees, youre better off saving the money
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:34:39
�������������� I like the optimism though
@_date: 2019-08-01 02:26:34
Jesus Christ... why is this guy in the bitcoin feed... if you believe in bitcoin, yet vote for this turd.. you either 1: don’t understand economics or 2: don’t understand bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:51:43
Brainwashed? Lmao bro.. the Democratic Party is shit.. I’m not a republican, but it doesn’t take a genius to know how corrupt the left is
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:43:40
Universal healthcare is a terrible idea.. governments notoriously cut corners and it’s proven the quality of care is much lower, mandatory minimum wage interferes with a free market and can actually have very detrimental effects on the economy, gun control is ridiculous and it’s an idiots solution to a much more complex situation...
From your comment I can tell you’re not an actual believer of bitcoin, because if you were you would understand that what you mentioned above strips the general public of their liberty, rights to make their own decisions, and contradicts the very foundation of free market capitalism..
My assumption is that you’re here because of money.. which is fine, but don’t spread the moronic idea that more government = better. Especially on a forum that’s related to a project that is the polar opposite of what you’re speaking for
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:50:07
There are many cases where universal healthcare has enabled governments to block life saving treatments because the odds weren’t very good, BUT life is precious and if you want to do anything in your power to preserve it, you have the right do do so. Governments only care about saving money which is why they refuse treatment if the odds aren’t in the persons favor.
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:33:52
 Please for the love of god, look into why this contradicts bitcoin.. bitcoin was founded on the principle of a free market... Socialism is the complete opposite and it’s foundation is based on the disproven theory of “late stage capitalism”
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:27:03
Lmao how high are you?
@_date: 2019-06-09 23:40:37
Lmao I wasn’t coming at you at all.. but I’d say it’s political due to the fact it’s based off of propaganda used by the communists..? Another thing that makes me LOL is how easily influenced and naive my generation is... it’s propaganda for a reason.. its “cool” because it’s made that way.. which was intended to garner interest and subconsciously promote a failed and dangerous status quo. socialism is trash, communism is trash, and this poster is trash.
@_date: 2019-08-01 02:30:43
Says the government who has amnesty boxes for tooth picks lol I’m sorry for my brothers in the UK... but jeez... that country has gone to shit.
@_date: 2019-08-02 01:20:51
Healthcare is one thing you do not want to trust your government with. I was in the US Army and we used government healthcare lol and it was terrible.
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:08:18
Nah, two party system is fucked and Republicans are shit too.
@_date: 2019-08-03 20:09:12
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:37:08
Idc. Regardless that’s a bad look and shows how naive people are... it’s trash imo. Maybe use the American revolution or France storming the bastille instead. There’s a massive difference lol
@_date: 2019-06-09 20:49:44
Lol I get the idea, but I don’t get the reference to commie propaganda... since bitcoin is a decentralized currency and communism is complete and total centralization of everything... people are naive.. lol let’s see some American revolution references.. at least that’s more relevant and meaningful.
@_date: 2019-05-09 08:43:05
So much hate for the Oracle of Omaha lol regardless of what his opinion on bitcoin and crypto in general is, the guys an investing guru lol people forget the guy is old.. he just doesn’t understand the concept behind bitcoin. When he thinks “investment” he sees Coca Cola and GE as good calls lmao remember... everything, including price and speculation is only relative to your concept and understanding of the underlying asset..  if warren was in his 20s/30s like us, he’d be a whale and dominate the emerging sector
@_date: 2019-05-19 05:24:03
id be more excited if people still watched TV lol
