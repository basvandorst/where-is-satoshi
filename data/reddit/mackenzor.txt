Is silver a fixed value? I feel like silver and gold are pretty useless. They are weak and only aesthetically valuable.

I guess I just need to learn more, and start watching the stocks. Do you think bitcoin is better partly because it started the cryptocurrency trend? I read the article, and it seems to say that bitcoin is simply more stable and will absorb other cryptocurrencies. Can you explain for someone who knows very little why this is?

You're so right, the evidence is right in front of me. Bernie, I'm selling my bitcoin and joining the fight!

Our government is a bullshit pyramid trickle down scheme. Honestly though, just explain how it works and how it's a safe investment as you should not be investing more than you are willing to lose and the potential gain is very high.
