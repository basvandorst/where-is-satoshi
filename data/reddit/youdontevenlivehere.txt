Probably because you can buy a futures contract for a fraction of the price of an actual bitcoin

Then drop $100 or something else. Small steps are okay. Think about 5 years from now. If it averages 3% yearly then  you’ll be beating inflation.

What cost basis would you even use
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:15:28
Not OP but i think it’s basically dollar cost averaging where you select a fixed dollar amount and spend that amount on a recurring basis. So for example you could acquire $100 worth of bitcoin every month instead of spending $1200 to acquire bitcoin once per year.

What if you don’t remember how much you paid for the original bitcoin? Is it fair to estimate? Also just wondering could you deduct losses from bitcoin- assuming that you bought high / sold for a loss

Technically (per the IRS) you are supposed to treat it as a taxable event

It isn't so much global economic crash, moreso hedging your local currency/economic crash. Buying crypto gives you access to a more global currency market. It obviously cuts both ways though, if you're talking global economic crash then yes bitcoin and other cryptos would likely be affected in some way.

Yes it was actually supporting your point.
They also have "insurance" per this page
But agree with you that storing bitcoins on their is a dummy move.
