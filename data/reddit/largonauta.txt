True that! But out of curiosity how would that even work? Like is it even possible, like physically possible to sell that amount on bitstamp? Even if, and then what? One does not simply withdraw 46 million dollars from bitstamp.... I presume.

Ok no problem, thanks anyway. One thing is for sure, I won't be using armory anymore (as soon as I get my BTC moved somewhere esle). I'm not a poweruser and armory is way too slow and intense.

ok I see. Yeah I made a paper backup. I guess I'll try to uninstall it now... or maybe I'll install armory on another pc and import the wallet there. Can I have mutliple armory wallets (clones)?
@_date: 2017-06-30 08:17:24
Yes I will. Btw the problem just got solved :D It wasn't fully synched, after several rescans I did a rebuild and re synch from the help menu.

hmmm, where do I get that (on multibit classic)? Is it the long string of characters in the transaction details?
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:45:48
But I only sent 2 BTC to my armory wallet! What are the other 5? 
Anyways I tried to rescan and restart armory. Maybe I'll unistall armory and bitcoin core and then just reinstall armory?
Thanks for you help and time btw.
