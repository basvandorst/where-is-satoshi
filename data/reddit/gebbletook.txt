Using localbitcoins for that amount is probably a good way to get yourself robbed. Take a trip to another country where it is legal. It'll be worth it to spend the couple hundred dollars to know you aren't going to be robbed of 10's of thousands of dollars doing shady deals. 
That is probably the safest way.

It isn't becoming, it already is. I've been using it every for like 2 years for finding torrents and talking with really fucking weird people. I'm old so I remember the early internet and this is the new early internet.

I think if you'd need to pay me BTC to take a philosophy course.

if satoshi ever cashes out he will just convert them to monero or some other privacy protecting cryptocurrency

How much energy do modern banking infrastructures consume?
In the future if crypto currencies take over and physical bank locations disappear there may be a net reduction in energy consumption.
On top of that, refining of the consensus algos may make mining more efficient. That is pretty much one of the key benefits of burst coin, proof of stake and monero.
Also, as we move away from coal and towards renewable energy this will be less of a concern. Mining companies are already looking into making wind and solar mining operations. 
Currently it is definitely a problem though.

It is sloppy and the attitude around "computers are jsut getting better don't worry" is a bad attitude when you're engineering something that needs to scale to global levels. What happens when 4 billion people use bitcoin everyday? That 1TB could become 1PB because people think about things in such a lazy fashion today. Same poor thinking behind destroying the environment.
