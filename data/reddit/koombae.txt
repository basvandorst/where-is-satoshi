Thanks mate. I tried the app its really good. I found several hotspots in my city. Already recommended it to most of my friends.The simple interface is seriously cool. Its kinda like the material look on lollipop.
Keep up the good work :)

Im from Sri Lanka and we have tons of tourists all year around. I really think this would help them. Ill give it a try :)

Btw the tourists would love this. Any ideas on promoting this among them?

Cool  
I shared the app with a few of my friends. I'll try to get them to cover as much as they can.

Sadly I kinda see what you mean :/ I just thought it helped to let people know about Bitcoin and get into it.

Im not really sure where you could find bitcoiners here. But most Sri Lankans use Facebook in comparison with other social media. That would be a good place to start I think.
