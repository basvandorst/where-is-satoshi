Whoops.  Looks like I was looking on Amazon and it is suddenly expensive as hell on there.  I don't see an option to purchase with USD.  Maybe I am just being dumb on the ledgerwallet site as well.

Didn't these used to be cheaper?  I bought a Trezor last year and I thought this was the cheaper alternative....I go to look it up and it's $150 USD now!

Jamie Dimon, while shit-talking bitcoin, summed up economics in one sentence. He wasn't trying to sound like an idiot, but (surprisingly) he did.
 "Bitcoin is only worth what the next guy is willing to pay for it."
Thanks. That's a groundbreaking insight into all currency and goods.

I am going to give Gemini a try. I really do wish Gemini allowed for credit cards, though. I can buy bitcoin and send it to my Trezor all within a few minutes on coinbase. I can't find any other website online that could make that happen for less $.
I don't know what to believe or make sense of when I read Gemini's website, so I'll hope you can answer. How long does it take you to decide "hey i wanna spend $400 on bitcoin!" and then send it out of your Gemini wallet to another location?
Saving some money would be worth a wait. Thanks for your help ahead of time.

100,000? Wow.  Seriously I've tried to find other methods that were as easy as coinbase and all of them had much higher fees.  That's been my personal experience.  The convenience and relatively low fees makes coinbase my go-to.

Can someone explain briefly what will happen to coinbase accounts when segwit is activated?  
That is a major concern among beginner users without any experience mining.  It is the easiest wallet/exchange for me to purchase bitcoin without paying crazy fees (I have tried other sites before).
Myself and others I know don't feel like the fees are currently all that exorbitant coming from there.  I don't have more than a year or two of experience in using bitcoin, so I don't have a perspective on what is different that would cause a need for change.  
Also, is it a great idea to put some money into Litecoin while it is so cheap?  Have very little to lose at the moment if there is some potential in Litecoin.

Give me an example of a website with fees comprable to Coinbase without any catch.  I couldn't find one when Coinbase was fucking me over.  Only found websites with exorbitant fees that I wasn't comfortable with at all.  The ease of use is Coinbase's best trait and I really don't think the fees are out of hand.  Sure, I don't like them...but whatever.  I didn't find anywhere else that was better.

When Coinbase was locking me out because they wouldn't verify my ID without me jumping through hoops, I looked hard for other websites with equivalent or cheaper fees that didn't seem sketchy.  That landed me in a situation where I was sending emails begging for those websites to delete my bank and personal info off of their servers.  I appreciated Coinbase so much more at that point.  In the future, where would you recommend I go and why?
