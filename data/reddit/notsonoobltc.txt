New Noobling here.. bought in a little high so my 1200 is down to around 900. I am holding tight tho.. I wanna buy more but i think it’s gonna dip a bit more
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:50:36

@_date: 2018-01-22 21:31:27
You have no clue what your talking about 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:29:23
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:14:39
If you bought high hold. if you bought low I would sell and watch these next few days for a good point to buy back in.. I wouldn’t buy today I would wait. My opinion but what do I know??? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:16:38
Yes. Your purchase price is your price no matter how high or low it goes afterwards
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:59:09
Fight me
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:59:32
Wait so you have to pay taxes on your coins even if you take a loss? That makes no sense 
@_date: 2019-07-30 19:23:50
Your loss.. next time do your due diligence
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:39:01
I was debating on trying to gamble with 10-20k last week and I’m so glad I didn’t. I started with a way smaller number just to see how the market works.. I didn’t say investing because at this time I would say most people are gambling with CryptoZ
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:59:27
Fight me
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:56:05
Going back down too 3500-4500.. bitcoin is something but right now it’s just a pump and dump.
@_date: 2019-07-06 04:05:27

@_date: 2018-03-02 01:19:52
Lmao scam 1000000%
Copy and paste the link into google and search. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 19:35:55
You guys are  way ahead of the game
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:20:20
Scammer get the fuck out 
@_date: 2018-03-25 02:56:57
Should be bitcoin and cash not bitcoin and card makes no fuckin sense.. what a dweetus
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:14:48
Not sure then some banks are having issues with coinbase
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:34:10
I don’t think it’s going to bounce back up tho that’s what I’m saying. Next 2-3 days just hovering around 7-9k
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:48:54
Time as in another 10 years??  This bull ain’t got no balls brothaa
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:21:31
Shut the fuck up you just posted this scam in another thread 
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:10:26
Gonna bounce back to 7700-8000 then shoot back to 10 during the week
Tag me during the week to remind me how correct I was 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:07:57
Bitcoin is gonna keep going down. I wouldn’t buy or sell right now. The hype is over and people are realizing that bitcoin has no real use yet ( high fees ) 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:16:09
I second this 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:24:16
Them HODLERS can HODL my SACK
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:08:01
You liked the fact you lost 100k? Stop trolling 
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:16:40
Cool bro 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:30:46
Where are the HODLerzzzzz
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:41:43
Let it go let it go let it go!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:34:43
How you hodling up? What’s your loss looking like 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:28:42
I already sold. I took a small loss.. I wouldn’t buy back in unless the coins go around 6k a coin. It’s gonna bounce back and fourth but it’s going to go to around 5k. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:12:00
I would say only 5% use it as a currency the rest are trading it. The ones who used it in the Silk Road day are the true holders 
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:38:38
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:19:03
People been saying this shit about the Wall Street bonuses for like 2 years.. just stop the shit is going down in the dm down in the dm
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:48:01
No not really.. right now it’s more like 2 sellers and one wanker buyer 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:39:18
People lost money. People are pulling out and not coming back in ever. I don’t think the price will break 15k for a long long time 
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:25:33
Hype is gone and I don’t see it going above 12k for a couple months.. I pulled my money moved over to weedstocks
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:59:31
Shitcoin won’t stop farting ⛽️⛽️
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:23:08
Well if you bought ATH you can’t sell.. no reason to take a 50% loss. You gotta hold and pray it bounces. I don’t think bitcoin will ever see 20k again.. 5k is the target price. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:16:49
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:00:30
Your wrong.. having a good credit score shows you do make good financial decisions. It’s not solely based on you paying on time. It’s also based on how much debt you have and how much you spend on credit cards etc.. You must have a low score and are very sour because of it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:56:37
Bro I am stoned as shit give me some slack 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:42:58
I took a small loss and sold. I don’t see a future in it.. just hype.. I’m not embarrassed to say I lost 500$. That’s a half day work for me
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:53:46
Good man. 500$ is whatever if you lose and whatever If you don’t.. but your prob gonna end up with like 3fiddy.. 3 fiddy
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:55:39
Why do you guys have to charge a FEE and also a premium when buying.. it’s never the actual price it’s always a couple hundred more 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:20:18
Looks like bitcoin is down almost 50% in the last 30 days. The hype is over and people are realizing they have no idea what they are investing in. If you made money take it and run it’s a wrap for shitcoin!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:33:37
They should give loans to people who pay them back. If you have 800 plus credit you should be able to buy whatever the fuck you want with a credit card. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:46:19
Idk i feel like it’s too late to make money and it’s way too risky right now.. I don’t see it going up really 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:18:39
Your not better at investing you just lost 100k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:44:22
Sell it’s going to 7 then 6
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:17:21
Try transferring money into coinbase wallet.. and there is plenty of other options for you I’m just not sure. I used coinbase..  currently don’t hold any coins 
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:24:18
That’s why he’s here dude..  yes yes and no.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:11:47
Can’t use CC. Has to be debit or Transfer 
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:57:19
Wait I been buying shytecoin it’s not real!!? They promised major gainz
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:23:15
You do the same! 100k is a lot of money 
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:31:11
Sounds like issue could be on your end. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:47:33
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:43:20
You just said you have been in since pre Silk Road.. and now you say you sold... stop trolling 
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:59:03
Let ya nuts hang 
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:27:16
Lmao this yeah back down too 5800
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:52:54
Sell half
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:50:47
When I see people using these I cringe
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:57:31
Fuck this pussy
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:06:22
You guys actually think bitcoin will touch 250k a coin? I mean come on that’s a little much no? If we can break ATHighs that’s what I would focus on.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:27:12
When bitcoin hits 250k I will eat my own shit
