Bitcoin is most likely not going to go under $3,500, but even if it does, it will surely crawl back up. And it will get more of my money on the way!

You forgot the lower demand for bitcoin overall. We can't neglect that part. It's not all batching and Segwit. But we are moving in the right direction for sure!

Visa vs Bitcoin, i'd love to see that movie made :D

Oh great! The money throwing iOS users can use cheap lightning to save up on costs as well!  *wink
Jokes aside, nice to see it evolving to something easy to use and compatible with all the OS's

Spot on!

Let's play some poker then mate!

Forbes doesn't need to maintain reputation, but readers, which are mostly just that, readers. They don't do research, or anything of that sorts. So if they can make a nice headline AND manipulate the market a bit... WIN-WIN, i don't see why wouldn't they.

Being condescending towards bitcoin bad, but it's as bad to think blockchain IS bitcoin. blockchain will live. Bitcoin will most likely remain the first and greatest blockchain utilization, but there is so much more you can do with blockchain. Simply, one is not the other, blockchain is a far wider term.

While people might be very agreeable with everything bullish regarding bitcoin, take great care in the people that speak the good and bad things. Peter is not... the most trustable person. But its good news anyways, hope it catches some traction market wise

Hahaha, +1 +1 +1

If you are from the U.S, don't even think about it. Tax man will come beating you with a stick
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:06:16
Yeah but transaction fees + taxes + trading risk for a low % gain... wouldn't be the best decision

I guess maple syrup is enough, screw the robbery.

Well if Bitcoin does want to be globally utilized and adopted, these kinds of controversy will not amount to any good... We need to address it with respect.

With free health care and apologetic people, he shouldn't worry that much, hey?

Anytime mate!

Judging by his car (not a lambo), the plates are words of regret for not hodling

Exactly. Save up and buy with above 50 bucks.

This is great news, but sadly got close to no traction with the news. Hopefully that will change

Scams... More failed projects OR scams, most of them are not intentional. But then again, check the startups, the success/fail rate is close to the same.
