@_date: 2018-01-31 19:17:03
if people are not spending prices of goods and service drop. your USD/EUR is worth more.
with bitcoin the same but the more transaction are done with btc the more value it gets. but it's a complete different mechanism as it's just rising in value compared to the currencies it substitutes.

it's just performing a slingshot to 100k. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:53:59
but we have to keep in mind that it'll have to rise in value the more adoption it gets in order to track the increasing transactions. we have three driving forces for its value to increase:  
- speculation
- adoption
- deflation (growing economy + fixed money supply = essentially a brother of adoption)  
after the stages of adoption and speculation the value increase will probably get lower significantly

got a 1060 for you. best bang for buck a few months ago.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:02:34
the problem is it has to increase in value drastically in order to track economical transactions on a significant scale. there is no way around that.  BTC as world currency must have a value &gt;&gt; 1M$. the incentive to be thrifty is high. which is not too bad regarding sustainability.

adding to 3)  
some exchanges like coinbase pro have feeless withdrawals. so simply withdraw right after the purchase. always use a hardware wallet (trezor, ledger) as if you have a longterm perspective even a $100 may become $1000-10000 or whatever. means if you lose the BTC you might lose more than the current value.

@_date: 2019-07-29 07:08:49
because Bitcoin is all or nothing and if you don't understand nor believe in its properties then it can only go down a lot for you. maybe that's the reason.
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:29:43
the marginal profit you gain from increasing your hashrate shrinks because you increase difficulty AND you have to add relatively more hashrate to gain the same share increase than when you have only a little share.
Just imagine having 100% of the hashrate. how much hashrate should you provide to make the most profit? answer is as few as possible. But you cant' control it in a competitive environment.  
Means if you have a high share already to increase your profit by 10% gets harder and less profitable as your weight is so high that you increase the diffculty by your own at some point.
Also mining is not a closed system where the rich get richer without anyone being able to take share away, as investments can be injected from outside.  
POS is questionable because you can airdrop coins with inception and it has circular logic, which means the network is secured by its own value. In PoS you have to secure the network with external ressources. Also once a staker has more than 51% coins you can only reduce is share by destroying the integrity of the protocol.

wow but:  
*To protect against multiple spending, the Bank maintains a database of spent electronic coins. Coins already in the database are to be rejected for deposit. If the payments are on-line, this will prevent multiple spending. If off-line, the best we can do is to detect when multiple spending has occurred. To protect the payee, it is then necessary to identify the payer. Thus it is necessary to disable the anonymity mechanism in the case of multiple spending.*  
nope, not decentralized. Would be VERY surprising if they actually had a solution to the double spend problem.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:35:23

everyone is egoistic to some extend. but are you so egoistic that you would let others suffer and die so you can amass more wealth even if you are quite wealthy already?  
Being rich in a society which is mostly poor and fighting for survival reduces your quality of life due to increased crime and so forth. So it can be quite in your interest (egoistic) to have a healthy balance in regards of wealth equality.

i am not sure if the dollar weakens if they dump for assets like gold and Bitcoin.  
if the dollar gets weaker to the yuan, they have an easier time to keep their high exports up.  
so if they go for assets that preserve value and weaken the dollar at the same time it might be a total win for them.

when I thought about Bitcoin reaching new highs I became kinda confused actually. many want to make gains in local currency. But when Bitcoin goes to let's say 100k-200k, will local currencies be even considered safe? Do I really want to sell my Bitcoin by then? Is averaging out of a new money that might become dominant an option? I mean this is not a stock speculation, you trade money for money. one replacing the other.  
this is the moment when I think it clicks and Bitcoin becomes a true SoV.

credit is surely an important mechanism to reallocate ressources. the question is if this reallocation is real by being backed by equity or if it's theft by doing fractional reserve.
@_date: 2019-07-19 09:18:02
all it does is inflating asset prices without creating value. especially real estate could be more affordable if money was a place to store value over a long period of time. on top real estate and stocks aren't as liquid as money. so the barrier to spend it eventually is lower.

that's quite impossible, respectively not worth the try.

1) they have to prove it first and handle at least as much transactions as Bitcoin. all they do is handle a pityful amount and claiming they scale.  
2) you must scale while staying decentralized. if you scale giving up decentralization you are not scaling at all  
3) how far do others alledgedly scale? 1000tps? that's not enough! we need more like 1M tps to serve the world, not to mention micro and nano transactions.

@_date: 2019-07-14 10:09:02
no financial advice but maybe it helps:  
1. if you understand Bitcoin and it's implications and you believe in them, then hodl. the upside outweighs the downside and it's a tool against future financial surpression.
2. if you do not care for Bitcoin besides the price and you invested more than you want to lose, then sell. it can crash to near zero (for example induced by an inflation bug in the code)  
if you want to learn more about Bitcoin the easy way:  
- check out speeches and videos from Andreas Antonopolous  
- read The Bitcoin Standard by Ammous or watch his speeches.

I think you mix things up. population growth has nothing to do with inflation in money.  
the type of money we use regulates ressource allocation in space and time. 
space:  
while an inflationary currency makes people invest in real estate simply to preserve their wealth, a deflationary currency does not provide this incentive. housing prices drop. ressource allocation in space changes.
time:  
while an inflationary currency gives incentive to consume on credit due to low interest rates and inflation you might prefer to buy something as soon as possible. a deflationary currency will probably lead to higher interest rates but at the same time increase in value over time. this gives people incentive to think more economically about consumption as opportunity costs of time is higher. ressource allocation in time changes.  
now while it seems obvious that a deflationary currency would reduce activity in some areas, it will increase activity in others. for example as credit isn't as cheap anymore people will tend to repair their cars instead of throwing it away and buy a new one. activity of local car mechanics might increase while global car production and scrap might decrease.
 it seems very logical that longterm thinking will play a much bigger role.

you even opened a channel after it didn't work? wow lol. it seems your understanding of lightning is lacking and ofcourse you need some knowledge about it at the moment. that's true. same for regular Bitcoin though.
a channel is absolutely mandatory and the receiving end also needs a channel. at current state it's problematic to start right away sending money to friends via routing nodes because you both start with a maxed out capacity if you open the channel with funds. means you can't receive funds if you don't spend some first.  
Loop IN/OUT functionality will make it much easier. It's about to get released and find its way into wallets.
I was a noob in LN as well, but didn't have any problem and I use it almost since the first day it went live. it's already great for spending, not so great to transfer funds to friends if they are noobs.

It's actually not that hard to buy and store Bitcoin. All the terms are very confusing in the beginning though. I remember the first time I was coming to this sub, I was like "holy shit. I don't understand any of that shit posted here. These guys must be geniuses to understand all this terminoligies" lol.  
Learning about the properties and implications of Bitcoin is great fun. As probably almost anyone here I recommend you the book "The Bitcoin Standard" from Saifedean Ammous. It's more about the economics than the technicals.  
You can contact me anytime if you have specific questions.

At first people won't hodl like maniacs for a 1-2% increase in value. People will always consume and desire things that are luxury. IMHO a currency must reward saving as it provides capital for future improvements. If you are saving you are leaving the ressources available to others. The reward for spending is satisfaction in the now.
If people hodl too much prices go down  
either --&gt; People spend more and prices go up  
or --&gt; Production gets reduced and prices go up  
Now if production gets reduced jobs get lost. Catastrophe! Some would say. But actually if people rather save for a few percent gains then these products aren't really necessary. Also it results in reallocation of ressources where people actually prefer spending.

as you can see with Bitcoin you can build systems with exactly the degrees of freedom that allow individualism. A protocol governed society therefore isn't necessarily leaning towards socialism (in terms of central planning).  
If there is competition between protocols, the protocols which are most broadly accepted will prevail. This ensures theoretically the right amount of degrees of freedom and most effective elimination of corruption.

It's about where your private key gets stored. You can use your regular PC with a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger Nano S). These are devices that store your private key safely. In order to access your BTC you gotta connect them to your computer. The private key never leaves the device and it's only connected when you really need it. That's called cold storage in contrast to hot storage on devices that are always online like your smartphone.  
If you are buying a for you significant amount of Bitcoin do not save money on the hardware wallet! Buy one or don't buy Bitcoin or any other crypto.

Yeah it's purely digital. Gold was used as money because it was hard to inflate and therefore very stable in value. Bitcoin is even harder than gold in respect to its inflatability.

use a pop filter and use it close to your mouth (~10-30cm) and not 2m away. make sure the signal does not overshoot above 0. It must be 0 or a slightly negative value in the recording software. You can also use a compressor so the signal gets less dynamic. means if you speak quieter the signal will be increased by the compression and if you speak too loud it gets decreased.

depends on general sentiment towards Bitcoin at the time of the crisis. If people see Bitcoin as what it is, the hardest money that ever existed, people will flood into it.

FIAT is also just believe or rather trust. We have a lot greedy wanne be speculators around these days. they might have to learn but I think I am pretty aware of what cryptocurrency is respectively can become and it might be way better than the current system. Not because there will only be one single national currency, but because there will be no law which currency to use. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 23:33:53

@_date: 2018-09-03 22:38:01
not extremely short.  
after the 2014 Mt. Gox incident it took 18 months for the trend reversal and 100x from bottom. Before that Bitcoin went 500x in two back to back bullruns (nov 2011 - nov 2013).  
so having a trend reversal 9-10 months after the crash (in a pretty positive environment without negative incident) wouldn't be extraordinary.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:53:13
what you explained seems to be true for an equilibrium in the market. But if there is a participant who wanted to short but there was no candidate to match this bet the short had to adjust to find a trading partner. this alters the price.  
your explanation transfered to normal trading would mean "price can't go up or down because if some one sells another one buys for the same price"

As a beginner simply use a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano. Setting up a full node on your regularly used computer doesn't make it the safest place. It's good as checking account for smaller amounts and to verify the tx yourself, but not to store large amounts safely without deeper knowledge.

Exactly. Debt based systems are inherently prone to bankruptcy if deflation kicks in as the effective debt increases with falling prices. This can't happen within a commodity based system as the debt level is way lower. Debt can still exist ofcourse but only in a 1:1 ratio so everything is backed. FRB leverages this risk to a extreme.

why would he change prices if people are forced to use his street. if one company owns all streets in south manhattan there is no incentive to keep prices low. price will be set for maximum profit, so that people don't switch to the subway, but way higher than in a competitive market. result will be a welfare loss.  
I can see a solution in your proposal though. If streets are publicly owned you can still charge people for using it the way you proposed to cover costs. this way you can reduce tax rates, which could be a welfare increase.

If YouTube for example couldn't exclude pornographic content we'd have porn all over Youtube, which would harm the experience because sex simply dominates other topics. There is no problem having porn on dedicated websites only. You actually have no restriction in accessing this content. On the other hand porn would probably always flood new popular streaming/vod platforms if not restricable because of 'freedom'.

Monero is the only coin I see as legit next to Bitcoin, even though I am also holding some ETH and ADA. But all those coins mentioned are threatened by Bitcoin not vice versa. ETH and ADA are 'threatened' by the likes of RSK Bitcoin sidechain. Monero is threatened by new privacy features in Bitcoin. The chances that Bitcoin assimilates the emerging altcoins is way higher than a new coin taking over.

Deversification is mathematically proven to have an higher EV. But you need negative or at least low correlation to increase your EV.

**1a** same with Gold then. You know who really is the greater fool after everything is said and done? the FIAT holders, they are at the losing end. That's why institutions will buy now cheap, set custody for rich people in place and small retail investors come last. This keeps the rich rich. 
**1b** Government can make holding Bitcoin illegal, but can they really stop it if people actually want hard money? no. Can they technically shut it down? definitely not because it has no single point of failure.    
**2** Yes but they are all very low in value. Bitcoin is the most secure and decentralized system out there with a first mover advantage on top. We are talking about a lot of wealth here. No one but speculators will prefer a fancy unproven altcoin over Bitcoin.   
**3** Bitcoin has 'brand value' and for the younger generation it has more and more sentimental value. If you dismiss Bitcoin, a digital gold for the digital age, you gotta explain how gold could become what it is today. so this is no argument at all.  
**4** Nothing has intrinsic value. The subjective value for people can have different properties. For now it's a ideological and speculative asset shape shifitng into a store of value and finally into a daily transaction method and unit of account. It depends on what stage we are. Gold was a medium of exchange, now it's degraded to a hedge or respectively to a store of value. The value of Bitcoin for people can be: censorship resistance, decentralization, limited supply, medium of exchange, flexibility, speed, store of value, privacy (has to be improved) you name it.  
**5** Blockchain is a buzzword. Blockchain without Bitcoin or other decentralized cryptographically secured systems is nothing but an Excel sheet.  
**6** Cryptocurrency issued by the state is worthless. Like a said above. Blockchain without a decentralized system is useless. Then we are better off with the current system with the option to use paper money. Bitcoin is a global money standard. Governments can bow to that or get rekt eventually.

yes but: a part of the mcap of the real estate market consists of speculative capital which overvalues the asset. this part can potentially be transfered from the housing market to Bitcoin if we are in an uptrend.

how is this FUD? 1000x is rediculous. it still is if it's 'only' 100x from todays value.  
I verymuch disagree though that awareness reached its peak in 2017. if you heard 'Bitcoin' and 'Blockchain' it means nothing. knowing a few new words is NOT awareness. there is still a lot to come in that regard.
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:31:41
not 100% correct. in a competitive market within the system fees have downward pressure and must at least cover cost the transaction causes. so the technical efficiency is definitely a factor!

LN is for payments that have to be instant and very low in fees. In your case you don't need LN. In its current state is very restrictive. No doubt. Everything we need for easy daily use is still in development but will come undoubtedly.

Yahoo was one of the better bets compared to the 'correlated' stocks that went to fucking zero. I mean yeah if you were buying the top you were fucked anyway. 
I assess the market by correlation, past developments and outlook in regards of adoption. Which coin has any adoption besides BTC that isn't pure marketing or ignorant merchants that ALSO accept e.g. Dash? In other words, who is accepting any altcoin but not BTC?

because it means rules are set and can be changed by those who opted in. Theft is again a very complex case. This would only be possible if all property is tokenized and more. That's not what I think will be of relevance. In 50-100 years property will be a less important concept due to high abundance and virtually free access to many material goods.

this discussion is very one-dimensional. The real question is what causes corruption in general. Factors are surely power and poverty. So the more distributed the power is and the wealthier the people, the less corrupt society is.  
Now you can argue that socialistic societies have a relatively powerful government and less wealthy polpulation, so those countries tend to be more corrupt.  
Cuba on the other hand has a powerful government and a poor population. The corruption is alledgedly rather low. What is it that could explain this?  
You also have capitalistic countries with strong governments (dictatorships) which are utterly corrupt and people are poor.  
This makes me believe it is mainly the power structure in society that leads to corruption, not the economic system. Therefore societies have to limit power in politics, bureaucracy and the economy. Decentralization might be the way.

that's exaggeration acting like the bug abuse was imminent. It would have required a miner to manipulate the block which is directly against the miners interest.
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:21:21
you know. Bitcoin in 2010 could have had &lt;1min blocktime with very small blocks. Your altcoins are either not secure, controlled or simply so small they can handle the load easily. Dogecoin or Litecoin for example are not the better bitcoin only because they are faster and cheaper. Think in perspective.  
Bitcoin is THE money of the future or no crypto will be it. Other crypto is interesting for other usecases but will often enough probably just end up as bitcoin 'sidechains' eventually.

What I mean is all debt can't be paid back at the same time, because debt equals money, therefore no debt no money in circulation. For every credit that's paid back someone new has to take a loan in order to not to shrink the money supply.  
It seems not obvious because anyone can choose to live debt free, but just as wealth, debt is not distributed equally.  
This guy explains the money creation system very well:

you are confusing free markets (voluntary interaction) and capitalism (private ownership/reapplying accumulated capital).  
What you describe as Socialism is not its definition. What you describe is the result of corruption which is inherently in centralized systems like Socialism. Same happens in Capitalism with growing mega companies and widening wealth gap. Extremely powerful corporation produce corruption. But you probably don't wanne see that because capitalism good / socialism bad.  
free market capitalism is the better system, no doubt. But we need to have more decentralization and less rigid company structures which produce corruption with growth.  
My hope is decentralization will make conventional companies the dinosaurs and bring us a completely new form of organisational structures (like OS) which reduce power and corruption immensly.

@_date: 2018-09-01 10:58:31


is it? Imho it corrupts the intelligence of humans. No one is thinking of the future, everyone mindlessly consumes in the now like animals. How the fuck can the US have a ~0% savings rate or even a negative one? Also the artificially increased economic activity is producing bubbles as supply can way easier overreact to demand than in a sound money regime.  
 




the economy simple wasn't as developed as today, that's the reason people were poor. Travel tickets were way more expensive and people could earn less.  
Hoarding is not bad. It's an important decision between saving and spending. If you save you give the market a signal, that it has to try harder to get your money. Today this meaningful decision is distorted and that's why people buy so much meaningless crap (on credit) just to throw it in a trash can a day later.  






Gold coins were actually the medium of exchange for hundreds of years. Gold as money disappeared because the states confiscated it and created the fiat money by decree.  
They will exist together for a while, with fiat ending up only being used for state related services. if at all.

with bitcoin in context of your logic    
1) if people don't spend, production goes down and prices rise. bitcoin gets worth less and incentivizes spending. 
2) if people spend a lot, production goes up and prices decline. bitcoin gets worth more and incentivizes saving.  
It will probably a very stable economy without extreme crisis and less crap produced. hard money will produce smarter people as they have a meaningful decision to make about the now and the future. and I mean this literally. People will care way more about the future, which is something we need more of not less.

Mining or Proof of Work (PoW) is needed to make writing to the blockchain expensive in order to make attacks expensive. The mining "CPUs" need to solve mathematical problems in order to write blocks.

that's too one dimensional. If they get cheap electricity in one area it doesn't mean they will getting it at a cheap when expanding the operation rapidly expanding there electricity demand. Marginal costs are almost only electricity. means market price for energy at increasing demand is determining if they have an advantage or not.  
but admitted the big miners are probably the ones that can sustain a low price for way longer than ASIC garage miners. But if the mining rigs aren't financed via loans the small miners also don't get into liquidity trouble and can put their rigs on and off at will. all they lose is profit.

you are right I do not agree with the article. Also not interesting because no new counter arguments. I've heard of Bitcoin several times but it was as late as mid 2017 that I digged deeper into it. Even though I was always bullish I also knew it would crash at some point, as many others who are in favor of crypto.  
regarding the article:
1) "Bitcoin is Tulip bubble 2.0" --&gt; ehm no. Tulips are no network which get more valuable as they 'grow'. Typical strawmen argument including a logical fallacy. 
2) "My fingernails are rare too" --&gt; same as 1)  
3) "Currently only speculators drive price" --&gt; yes that's true, and that's true for all investments to some extend.  
4) "Bitcoin is no investment as it creates no value/returns" --&gt; Bitcoin is a special case for an investment. It's value increases with network growth and demand for it. As a store of value and transaction method it very much creates value for people.  
5) "Investing in Bitcoin is a waste of time as you as an investor create no value" --&gt; The fact that the network gets more valuable as it grows proves the contrary point. As an investor you help the price to increase and in consequence the awareness and adoption to rise. The profit you make is the reward for helping the network to spread over the planet. Profits are high in the early stages as it's the most risky time for the network and they will decrease over time the clearer the victory of Bitcoin as hard money becomes. (if it wins at all)

2008 a lot of money went into gold. If sentiment has changed towards crypto, a stock market crisis might shoot crypto out of the milky way.  
regarding real estate it's not only about people looking for a home. It's about investors looking for a place to keep their capital. those and low interests are driving the price.

There is no intrinsic value in anything. That's right. But if people want to use the Bitcoin network because they have an advantage of it, it has value for them. It gets naturally more valuable the more people use it. Just like Facebook. It's utter shit if you are the only registered user.
You can predict percepted value if it improves the life of humans. That's what you do when you market a new product, predicting that people find it valuable.

Did you lose shortterm because you FOMOed in at 20k? Can't remember when I had to read such a nonsense. Are actually trolling? 
all time price of Bitcoin is nothing but increasing. It's vice versa. You have to pick your timeframe carefully to claim that Bitcoin is losing value. If you bought at 20k and sold at 6k. Well, bad decision which could've been be prevented with some studying.  
Based on the price charts Bitcoin is tulips? Based on reality Bitcoin is absolutely NOT tulip. Bitcoin is a network that creates a hard money system for the people who use it. Tulip is a fucking flower.

it's about the incentives. in fiat the sole incentive is to spend like there is no rressource limit. I can imagine in an not developed country it might be superior in order to maximize growth with the known side effects like bubbles.  
with bitcoin you get rewarded for saving, namely saving ressources for others to use. in theory it's a much more sustainable approach to manage ressources. this doesn't mean no one will spend. the incentive to save is just reducing rekless consumerism.

**1a** Gold has other uses but these are miniscule today, also due to its high price. It would be used in way more products if Bitcoin would overtake golds position as uninflatable store of value and free up the gold reserves for actual economical use.  
**1b** I don't think governments will make it illegal. It's very unlikely, at least in democracies. Most countries already gave it the status of privat money and are rather looking for regulations than straight up bans.   
**2** ---  
**3** Bitcoin is still young and still most people at least heard the name. Gold has a very long tradition, but as you might have noticed, the community and promoters are building a bridge by calling it "digital gold", so people get immediately into the right mindset.  
**4** You can be sure that value is always subjective. As far as we know the universe doesn't care if you die or not. So even food has no intrinsic value. It has subjective value to living things due to their survival instinct. An apple has value to a human and an elephant, but has it value to a moskito? Does gold have value to an elephant? I don't think so. It's all subjective as strange as it might seem. What people call intrinsic value is the illusion of obejctive value produced by community consenus and the feature of shape shifting like gold has when it's used as money and alternatively as industrial metal.  
**5** Just imagine an table in an Excel sheet. One line is one block of a blockchain. And in every line is a transaction noted. Now you simple keep adding line (blocks) to that table and continue the book keeping. That's it. Without distribution of this ledger and cryptographic security it's worthless.  
**6** yes it's possible to use bitcoin simply as a reserve currency, which is pretty much the same as a gold standard. But don't be fooled, this would be a fragile state as banks and governments will always try to corrupt the system. Not meaning that they are evil, it's just natural egoism.

oh it makes a lot of sense. If Bitcoin is desireable, otherwise the whole talk here would be useless, the adoption will come from those who want this desirable thing.  
2 little examples:  
1) *Adoption driven by spender*  
Technology e.g. Smartphone. The spender decides what will be adopted and what not. The spender adopted the smartphone and not vice versa. 
2) *Adoption driven by receiver*  
The invention of money. I have cow meat to sell. Someone else wanne give me shoes for it. I say "fuck you! I want that universially interchangable thing in your pocket so I can decide later on what I wann get for it". The mechant is the desiring actor here because the buyer would be happy to get rid of the shoes from his own production.  
Generalized: What ever you want adoption for it's forced by those who want to make the holder give it to them.

I'd consider myself rather a social-liberal. Bitcoin and decentralization is interesting in order to seek solutions that further social equality while being regulated on an individual level. lefties usually refer to the state as a central organ, but I think for left imperatives to truely come into action it must be based on freedom and a decentralized systemic approach that incentivizes social behavior on the smallest organizational unit, the individual.

Many are anticipating a huge crash. The reasons are nebulous yet.   
as long as no one can point on specific reasons, like 'dotcom bubble' or 'real estate loan bubble' there is no reason to think a crash is immenent.  
QE alone is no reason at all. It can become one if speculations are financed via loans and the asset prices are falling due to a shock. but what will the shock be?

most importantly:  
1) Bitcoin is hard money with virtually uncorruptable limited supply. It's purely digital but harder than gold.  
2) Bitcoin is a decentralized network, which allows to transfer money peer-to-peer without the use of a bank. Just like giving cash to someone. The decentralized property also prevents corrupt people to change Bitcoin to their advantage.

@_date: 2018-08-13 18:30:00
1) the misconception of what drives Bitcoin adoption (falsely the spender) comes from the standpoint that's it's viewed as an ordinary product. As we never witnessed an innovation of money, you can't blame anyone. But this view is plainly wrong imho. Innovation in money turns what we usually experience on its head because it's the other side of the same coin.    
2) "USD devaluation" can be a catalyst but first of all it's consequence of Bitcoin adoption or in general adoption of other money, simply due to supply and demand. 
3) The big assumption we have to make in order to talk about Bitcoin succeeding is that it is (or will be) in fact the better money for a single person from his rational standpoint. Wanting and holding a money that rises in value is rational.
There are three phases that (might) lead to universal adoption. They are not sharply devided:  
- Phase 1 "Ideology" (past): Like minded people become the first hodlers. They have kind of a political agenda and don't act in the sole desire to increase their wealth. Price rises.     
- Phase 2 "Speculation" (present):  People speculate on further rising prices and drive the price upwards. Memes like "HODL" conveniently serve as propaganda in order to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. This builds the foundation for the mass-adoption. The higher the price goes the better.      
- Phase 3 "Mass-Adoption" (future): People who exchange their good&amp;services for money will start to demand Bitcoin as it's more and more becoming a cheap way to transact, a secure way for the merchant as there are no charge-backs (!) and it holds or rather rises in value. This will force Hodlers to liquidate their holdings and it will force the late majority into Bitcoin.

just look at the crashes in the past. imagine you invested right at ATH. you'd feel horrible if you had any feelings about it the next months.
this is simply like any high risk/high reward investment. It can pay off massively, crash to 100$ or maybe simply hold its value (which is a possibilty very few consider to be one).  
and additionally it gives me a nice ride witnessing a revolution unfolding right before my own eyes. I don't give a shit if it's dropping, even though I'm not invested with peanuts, as I am actually very confident BTC and ETH will keep improving. Also always consider the billions of $ miners invested in bitcoin mining. I don't see it simply crash and go away.

it's mostly used in speculation and as an store of value. usage for daily purchases is very low. some accept bitcoin already though, for example to buy computer games. but adoption is increasing. we are still in the very beginning.
the usual way to get bitcoin is buying it through an exchange. For example localbitcoin, coinbase (US/EU) or gemini (US). after buying more than just for a few bucks to play with, you should use a hardware wallet (Trezor, ledger nano s). Otherwise you can use a less secure hot wallet on your smartphone.

1) hodl  
2) price skyrockets / fiat devalues  
3) merchants force hodlers at one point to spend their bitcoin because they only want sound money.    
4) moon landing / stable price

"Deflation spiral" is very likely a fiat myth. If due to hodling prices fall, production will also decrease, which reduces supply and increases prices again. So tell me, are the companies producing anything of real value if people rather hold their bitcoin/gold instead of spending it?   
The saved bitcoin/gold will eventually flow in goods/services/investments that are interesting enough for the people to spend their beloved hard money. hard money forces a real decision between the now and the future while fiat simply serves the now and risks the future.  
 
Consumers going into debt for the 2nd and 3rd TV. What a joke. Fiat made us animals again only living in the now.

we already have crowd funding and it'll probably increase in size. Additionally traditional banks can still give out loans but only the actual existing bitcoin. This tendentially increases interest rates and lets only the most promising opportunities realize, which as a side effect decreases chances of bubbles and crisis. Todays saving rate in the US is pathetic. Guess why. This rate will increase and ensure investments in the future.  
Also I wanne note that due to higher savings, a lot of the 'plastic garbage' you can find for 99cents in every grocery will almost disappear, as people actually have an incentive not to buy that trash.
thought experiment: what if no one wants to use hold fiat because it's losing value and governments can't ban bitcoin?

imho there ought to be principles that underlay a peaceful society. and these principles may not be used by parties that want to violate those.  
for example the NSDAP (Hitlers party) was a democratically elected party, therefore they used the democratic system in order to overthrow it. at that time being in the resistance wasn't exactly populistic but legally and morally right.  
now, there is freedom of speech in germany, except that you may not incite others to anti-democratic political actions. especially nazi propaganda.

for bitcoin to become stable you want adoption and it to skyrocket.

what's the message here?
@_date: 2018-05-31 09:53:11
if there was no lending at all.  
companies and people with debt will go bust in a deflationary phase as they generate less revenue due to falling prices. debt is nominal. 
this could only be resolved with a seperate "lending crypto" in existance as the trade value between bitcoin and the "lending crypto" makes the nominal debt to relative debt.

@_date: 2018-05-31 12:42:16
1. interest is necessary to incentivize lending no matter if we are in a inflationary or deflationary regime. this doesn't work in a deflationary regime if the debt is nominal. that's why we'd need a vehicle in order to make debt relative (and btw this is also true for profit meassurement as a nominal loss can actually be a relative gain in a deflationary regime)  
2. yes but the debt is nominal. It doesn't account for the change in value of the amount that has to be paid back. So actually your real debt increases over time.

if bitcoin has a positive outlook, means price rises, merchants are very interested in accepting bitcoin. consumers (in the industrialized world) will just use it for fun mostly, and as they get paid in fiat still simply replace the amount of bitcoin they have spent.  
adoption is still extremely low but it happens. if it's gonna explode is another question. bitcoin definitely needs 2nd layer to achieve that, otherwise tx fees will be too high.

yeah but this is not cut off or something. it is all price data there is.  
the exponential growth until today doesn't imply that it's getting significantly harder. with increasing adoption you also have improved foundation for further growth. At some point it will get harder, as there are only so much people who can put all there money into Bitcoin, I agree. But we will see this in the chart, that it's flatening at some point. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:26:28
not because one processor denies some other company its service, for quite decent reasons imho.  
There are different reasons I stayed:  
- I want fiat to be replaced by a global hard money. More profit for the value creators instead of for the middlemen. Growing global consciousness.    
- I want digital privacy. Because I think the digitization of money is inevitable, even with fiat. So I have no choice but being interested in Bitcoin and Monero.  
- I want a more and more decentralized world in order to destroy corrupt power structures. A new form of organization without throwing free markets over board.  
- And in the process I wanne make some money.

this only measures the amount of people having crypto. but most have probably less then 10% of their free cash in crypto. which makes the 3,5% a 0,35% in a best case scenario.
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:16:44
bitcoin is already slightly beyond being a collectible. And yes Bitcoin is providing a service. people misinterprete it because there is no company behind it charging them. but actually miners charge you for the transaction service. not as a company but as a participant in the network.  
this is a decentalized system, a whole new way to run a 'business'. I think the huge majority simply can't get their head around it yet.
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:20:49
bitcoin is digital cash. if you withdraw money with your debit card you actually declare that amount as it's known from where you had withdrawn it. it's traceable.   
A Rolex is a border case. Regarding the EU you have to declare gold, silver, diamonds, stocks etc. but not jewellery.  
this is very hypothetical anyway as you can memorize your seed and recover the wallet whereever you want. but from a regulatory perspective I could imagine that they will treat it as cash.

nice this would make me $6000. home cinema inc.
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:39:53
it's an issue of interpretation. Your HWW respectively access to your HWW can be considered cash. Actually it's rather cash than a debit card, because when using debit card it's still open to scrutiny.  
objectively from a regulatory perspective it makes more sense to consider it cash. I wouldn't be surprised if that will be the case for the regulations coming.

1) buy Trezor (or Ledger Nano S)  
2) Check if packaging is damaged  
(yes) send back and demand a new one  
(no) proceed
3) go to trezor.io plug in your Trezor and follow instructions like writing down the seed which has to be stored in a safe place. The seed enables you to restore your private key on a new device in case you lose it. be very accurate in everything you do. 
4) set at least a PIN-code so not everyone getting hands on your trezor can transfer money.      
5) transfer your bitcoin to your trezor  
6) spend&amp;replace or hodl strong

BTC always increases dominance when prices fall and loses when prices rise, as altcoin are way more volatile but correlate strongly with BTC.  
this btw might be evidence (if it's not clear already) that volatility decreases with liquidity respectively adoption.

what if i told you that BTC dominance goes down because alts are a pump-dump-festival to make a lot of money?  
go through the alts and realize that not even a handful coins are NOT close to 100% correlated with bitcoins price. (ETH, ZCASH, DCR ...). 
taking this correlation into account BTC dominance is more like 80%

example for a miner before the halvening:  
mining: 10 BTC  
expenses: 5 BTC  
--&gt; a 'hodling miner' now throws 5 BTC on the market to cover his expenses  
example for a miner after the halvening:  
mining: 5 BTC  
expenses: 5 BTC  
--&gt; the miner now has to throw 5 BTC on the market to cover his expenses    
for this extreme case market supply is the same and changes nothing in price. It firstly reduces his savings (in BTC) and not his sellings. So the halvening has only an immediate price effect if miners do not hold and throw more than they have to on the market AND if the halvening reduces those profit sell offs.

pretty good and objective write up. I really dislike the general rejection of fiat as evil, while actually it has very useful traits as you described it.  
But right now I still cannot grasp how Bitcoin or crypto has to evolve to form a even more sophisticated systems approach. The increase in supply of Bitcoin through the block reward is a complete different thing than increasing supply through lending. the block reward only ensures network security is build up in which the network can grow. The supply is not directed to economic entities that actually generate economic activities with it. This is what fiat does.  
For me this is the biggest puzzle to solve. How can crypto "reach into the future" without intermediaries?

Imho this is no FUD at all. It's how you could see things realistically.  
It says: "Bitcoin trends 'bad' on google, wallet count doesn't rise as much and real world adoption has to kick in to pump the price again. This could take 3-5 years."  
imagining a flat line for 1-2 years and for example LN kicking in to pump the price doesn't sound too unhealthy to me.

at first if you assume a equilibrium of 50:50 of those   1000k.  
+ 8k can change the ratio to 508:500  
+ the news can influence traders decisions as there was the rumor Mt.Gox holdings sell off induced the crash  
+ once a downswing is detected panic seller jump ship.  
+ we had an upswing and a downswing was very likely anyway after 10k wasn't broke through.

Bitcoin is a decentralized system wether the coins are equally or unequally distributed. Bitcoin is not responsible for wealth distribution. If you want to concern about this then analyze the economic system of which the monetary paradigmn is only a part of.

how can you take opportunity if you are not educated?  
how can you educate yourself if you are not healthy?  
how can you be healthy if you end up homeless without social security?

I think developement is accelerating and it won't take 2 years for the next rally. too much is going on in the space. I wasn't around in 2014 but I'd assume the awareness about crypto has changed a lot, even though the general public still isn't very interested nor does it understand bitcoin.  
I say longer bear if bitcoin falls below support at 6500. bull starts this year if it bounces off a third time.

So much ignorance and misunderstanding. It were the dictatorships and centralized economies that caused so many deaths, not Marx. You are still confusing Marx with historical communism. That's like saying Adam Smith is responsible for the millions that died under capitalist oppression. Marx was by no means responsible for that pitiful execution. Lenin was by the way a complete moron to believe he can turn a peasant state (russia) into a centrally organized economy. And as we know today, decentralization is a way better concept.   


Especially the article you posted was not anti-semite.
Did he "for no other reason than ego" lived a life in poverty and rejection relying on others to make meets end?  


At first, one of his huge realizations were the alienation of the human from his nature through repetitive work. 12-14 hours a day the same move over and over. Childs at 8 years working like robots. He actually wanted the human to be free from this oppression and being able to do different things throughout the day.  
But for you it seems to be human nature to work at Foxcon, even today still a slaver company. Hierachical oppression is also human nature right, especially for those who are oppressed? Capitalism actually demands from many humans not to be free and follow their desires.  
Capitalism today is 1000x better than the historical communism. But Marx isn't that communism.  


lol dude. This was everything to him. He had a lot of admiration for the innovation potential of capitalism.  


wtf man. Even the communist manifesto demanded free education. actually that was one thing that actually worked in those communist countries. illiteracy rates were historically low.

I am not talking communism here, I am talking Karl Marx. And you definitely have not to educate me on this matter, as I was born into a devided Germany with relatives on boths sides.   
He never worked out more than the communist manifest regarding a communist system, which was barely a description but rather a political pamphlet. and the communist manifest was written in turbulent times, when half europe was in revolution fever. first he thought the working class should lead the revolution to dethrone the emperors and kings, but then paddled back and favoured the capitalists (bourgeoisie) to do the revolution.  
His main work which was "Das Kapital" dwarfs the few pages of the communist manifest. All he does in there is describing the capitalist system of that time. For him it was about knowledge, and not really about a political system designed on the drawing board. He btw rejected all self-proclaimed Marxists.  
I think it's very important to differentiate between the philosopher Karl Marx and historical communism.
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:31:54

doesn't work because the wealthy would leave the system while those in potential need stay. a society either agrees on helping the weak/poor or it doesn't. this is a political decision.  
we have this with health care in Germany. you may leave the statutory health insurance if you earn over about €50k. this leads to the young (healthy) and 'wealthy' leaving the system, which makes it overall more expensive for the rest. it still works but it could be way cheaper.

If you are a socialist Bitcoiner I think you can't believe in a socialism with central authority. imho people don't see yet what is possible in the future by decentralizing power and huge advancements in technology. I believe in 'socialism' when I see it naturally unfolding by market forces towards decentralization. this is not a political question but a systemic question of how society organizes itself without arbitrary authority.

I am not an anarchist. so count me out.  
I was thinking revolutionary once, but I came to the conclusion that a systematic approach is much more realistic and effective. simply give people new possibilities to organize the economy and society and things will get better in terms of freedom and properity.  
for example communists want to seize all capital and redistribute it. It's violent and arbitrary. Nothing good can come from it.  
instead introduce new tools and ways of organizing economic entities without much of a hierarchy. counteracting the concentration of power. if it works better, it will win in the long run without disruptive violence of an arbitrary revolution.

Private key = gives control over funds (your bank)  
public key = let anyone see your balance (yoir balance is the sum of all addresses/UTXOs)
addresses = like bank account ID to receive funds or send funds to, only that you can create a new one for every transaction. why? because if someone has sent you funds he has the address and with this address he can check the blockchain what happens on this address. that's why you generate a new address everytime you receive funds.  
in any wallet you can press a 'receive button' somewhere which will generate a address that you can share. public key and private key has no use for you right now.

the puzzles start to fit together. 
If a currencies crisis starts people will flee partially into US Dollar. The US Government knows that and wants that. Bitcoin and gold are the threats that may reduce the demand for US dollar, so they are not interested in making it easy or very profitable. taxes also create demand for US dollar.  
other countries have the opposite view. It might be better for its people to flee into Bitcoin or gold instead of USD to reduce the pressure on their own currencies compared to USD.

don't mix up personal preference with facts. Bitcoin is not cheap to run, especially if you want to keep it decentralized. Samson saying it's (currently) not for people earning less than $2 doesn't mean that he WANTS to exclude them. Increasing the blocksize indefinitely is like printing money. you devalue the coin over time by centralizing it. We'll see it with bcash. (or maybe not because actual blocks are very small because no one uses it)

QE and FRB aren't actually the same. Also FRB doesn't necessarily create inflation. Inflation is only happening if the money created and the investment that follows doesn't increase economic output. If someone lends money to buy a used house, you are inflating the supply. But if you construct a new house you are actually creating new value.

there is always a next crisis as far as we can tell. if you consider it inevitable it's not an emotional question, but rather a question if you prepare yourself. high savings split in fiat, gold and Bitcoin. if you can live off your fiat savings for 1-2 years you should be fine.  
in case fiat inflates drastically your gold and Bitcoin holdings should keep you afloat.

there must be a mechanic to limit supply/inflation. giving every wallet a coin would inflate the coin into oblivion. doesn't work.  
fairness is subjective, no doubt. but premining a huge stack and market the coin as neutral global money doesn't work for me.

building the street is the service.

it's a very interesting idea and it opposes current economics.  
usually you have zero marginal costs of selling another mp3. which makes artists earning millions on a month work. it scales enormously and everyone else working in the physical world can't do that.  
your concept brings this physical world to the digital, just like Bitcoin did with scarcity of digital goods.  
corporations won't support it though as it reduces their margin on digital goods drastically. but maybe I am wrong and they actually can put a price tag of $20M on a song.

idealism vs realism
there are roughly two ways to mass adoption. mass adoption over 30-40 years only p2p or fast mass adoption in 5-10 years with third parties for the start. you may not forget many people can't even start a PC on their own, not to speak of using a smartphone. it needs a generational shift to make it fully p2p.

premine means that the founders of the coin get a stack for free outside of its operating  mechanics. early bitcoins were cheap to mine but everyone could do it.
@_date: 2019-11-30 23:51:40
not really. it 'just' defeats some purposes.  
holding BTC in a bank still lets you use it as SoV and speculative instrument. and if they later fund the capacity of your LN wallet then you also can make anonymous payments.  
it's not just black and white.

you see it only from an individuals perspective.  
if a street is proposed to be built through a village the service is offered to a group of people. if it's not decided by majority vote you'd have the situation that almost everyone would opt-out in order to let the others pay. group decisions which overrule the individuals choice are a reality you'll always have to deal with. if you don't want that you gotta live all alone somewhere in nowhere.
now the question how you arrive at such decisions overruling the individual is another one.

we are talking about money and the money's function is not only medium of exchange (MoE). It enables to spend at any later point in time, so it enables you to save for the future. in order to fulfill it's function as store of value (SoV) fully it may not inflate. On the other hand it doesn't diminish the quality of money as MoE if it deflates. at any point in time it is as good as MoE as an inflating currency would be.  
so for now Bitcoin usage is mainly saving and speculation. Why would I spend Bitcoin if I also have Euros/Dollars that lose value over time?

Your oppinion is based on severe misconception of the matter. Socialism as we experienced it in the past, was always based on a nation state and central control. It's not the opposite to nationalism.

ofc there would be a crisis. people holding Bitcoin doesn't make fiat debt disappear. and especially if people would all switch to Bitcoin we'd have a collapse of all those inflated asset values.

you must be familiar with the S/F model to understand the charts.  
the first chart shows upper and lower bounderies as a multiple of the "fair value" accoring to the S/F model and how those bounderies become more narrow (or Monero? kek). the dots are realized multiples at given time.  
the second chart shows upper and lower bounderies and the actual price instead of multiple.

scaling with altcoins just means you trade security for throughput. you could as well use some kind of sharding on Bitcoin. result would be the same. security trade offs at the base layer aren't acceptable tho if you want to have a financial system for the world. you simply can't afford a failure.

we don't have to deal in absolutes. With Bitcoin many more people will hold their money by themself than now with fiat. it's a massive improvement and banks will have to compete with their custodial service for customers. much healthier environment.

LN is completely off-chain and has different mechanics. you can't send money without an invoice and transfer amounts are limited to channel funding. On the plus side it's extremely fast and cheap.  
afaik Liquid is a side-chain with settlement on per tx basis. It's way slower than LN but you can send unlimited amounts like on the Bitcoin base-layer, but it's not on the base-layer.

@_date: 2018-10-25 00:03:31
bitcoin cash follows an unsustainable path in regards of scaling. bitcoin has the better long term solution (2nd layer) which beats bitcoin cashs approach (big blocks) 1000-fold in speed. bitcoin cash supporters ask you to accept 0-conf tx in order to make it instant. while I think that's acceptable for small transactions it's by far not an end solution for higher transaction speeds.

**Healthcare in Germany:** If you are employed, you and the employer pay approx. 14% into the statutory health insurance. So people with low income pay less and people with higher income pay more up to a limit from which you don't pay more. Only if you are in the high income bracket (approx &gt;60.000€ a year)  you may choose between a private insurance and the statutory health insurance. Once you left the statutory health insurance you may not go back, which mostly results in lower cost when young and healthy and much higher cost when old and sick. No matter what you must be health insured. In case you are unemployed insurance is paid for you by the tax payer.  
**Retirement in Germany**: Same as health insurance. Employer and employee pay approx 18% of your wage into a statutory pension fund. Germany utilizes a current income financing. People who work today pay for people currently in retirement. Your pension is calculated by the amount you have earned compared to others during your working phase. You can retire between 65-67 years. You get approx. 45% of your average net income after taxes and insurance, which means for many it's not enough and they still rely on social benefits by the state.  
hope this was interesting for you

what's the problem of it not being inflationary?  
You know why current economists fear deflation and want a little bit of inflation? It's because all money created is debt. debt contracts are denominated in fiat. if a deflation starts companies have less nominal(!) revenue but still can be profitable as before. BUT the debt stays nominally the same and therefore effectivly increases. this causes profitable businesses to collapse under the debt pressure.  
that's a sickness of a fiat currency and does not apply to a commodity money with fixed supply.
@_date: 2018-10-13 22:45:06

If they use BTC as collateral for fractional reserve to create Euro loans the valuation of the reserves would be very volatile. 
FRB BTC loans are not practical as they would have to have a seperate payment network apart from Bitcoin to circulate fake Bitcoin that then can't even be sold on regular exchange, except they are integreated in this parallel network. Would not work or would not be sustainable. 
I don't think that this even CAN be part of the law.

1. Bitcoin must go 100-1000x before it gets stable. no way around that. we are witnessing gold's history of thousands of years compressed in 20-30years. In time lapse so to say.  
2. very few people will spend their Bitcoin on Amazon before it has topped out and took over the world. You use bad money (fiat) over good money (Bitcoin). that's reasonable to do no matter what your motives are. 
3. the motives of someone buying Bitcoin are secondary at best. If you want Bitcoin to succeed you need it to spread until it's distributed all over the world. once it's stable and fiat is dead or secondary at best people will widely start using it because there is no bad money left. All these pipedreams of Bitcoin being a daily MoE are baseless. It's stupid to use it as such until it's the ultimate worldwide SoV.  
I am not concerned about regular moon boys. The people who contribute to the code and run nodes are in control and those do understand the true value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-15 22:06:22

I see your point and I agree. It's not a main property of Bitcoin. Nevertheless it is needed at one point and I anticipate that LN and side-chains will deliver on their promise. People like to hear it and the opposition will argue Bitcoin is slow and expensive.

careful. in the event of a fiat currency reform debts might be partially cut but also reorganized by setting an arbitrary exchange rate to the new currency. they might release a law that converts all debt contracts to the new currency.

@_date: 2018-10-18 09:16:26
theoretically less sell pressure. but miners always have to cover their costs. so it will only increase the price if miners do not hodl their profits. means the halvening decreases profits and therefore the selling pressure. otherwise the sell pressure wouldn't decrease.  
part of the price increase might also be psychologically induced.
@_date: 2018-10-19 09:34:33
what you define as a lot's of is not a lot at all. probably mostly people who care for the idea. but you need adoption by economic necessity which is when Bitcoin is seen as the best money and SoV and has significantly pushed other money aside. before that regular people will spend their fiat (soft money) first. I use Bitcoin for the sake of it if it's possible as it something special. But rationally I'll always spend my fiat first.
@_date: 2018-10-30 09:54:58
at present risk adjustment is applied as well. it's no real difference. If I can decide to lose 2% or 10% I'd ofc take the 2%.
people will still consume what they need and what they value. people pay $1000 for a smartphone just to have it now instead of waiting 2-3 month and get it with a &gt;25% discount. they obviously won't consume for the sake of consuming. that's sick. stable money gives every human meaningful decisions to make, if to save resources (and leave them to others) or to  spend ressources.  
Do you want to save some money every month or do you want to spend it all? What's sane and what's insane? the era of blind consumerism must come to an end in my oppinion. we'll be much wealthier as a society if we manage ressources more economically. that's just common sense dude.  
jobs are threatened anyway. unemployment is always too high and technology won't improve the situation in this regard. I think in the long run the way we handle work/income must change. I don't know how but considering the massive outputs we produce today, in 20-30y it will be kind of anachronistic to fight for survival on the job market.

efficiency has zero effect on total energy consumption it just sets you ahead inside the mining market over other miners. it's the costs to mine that determines the consumption. if electricity costs would go to zero, mining would increase drastically and vice versa.

If you take a loan for a house you are in debt for 25-30 years. I see many people suffering from this because they get stressed and insecure when they feel they are threatened to be forced to sell their house after paying back for 10years already.  
That's how I see it. If you are cool with taking a loan, that's your thing.

Speed and fees isn't what makes Bitcoin king. It's not what makes crypto great. Why do think was it a problem to begin with? It was one because other properties are more important, and those alts with speed and cheap transaction in their base layer are destined to fail as they are not secure or not decentralized. Those alts attack from the 'speed and cheaper fee' vector because that's where they see their window to lure people into their coin. On the important fronts they lose.  
 
Bitcoin is fast and cheap already. It's just a question of adoption on the 2nd layer, which keeps Bitcoins base layer virtually unbreakable.

Makes no sense because:
As long as there is a huge speculative upside, MoE can't be thing for the average person as spending comes with a huge cost in terms of lost profit. Which means it's SoV until the speculative upside is small enough for people to use it as MoE.  
MoE before SoV is alchemy.
Silkroad is a special case because people just wanted to be anonymous and therefore was a usecase remote from general MoE and SoV. Today it would be done with Monero.
@_date: 2018-10-19 10:12:53
it can only apply to efficient markets and even there regulations are needed as the capitalistic system is not fit to take all costs (e.g. environmental costs) into account. radicals of the free market want to apply it everything tho, not understanding there are natural monopols/oligopols like basic infrastructure which can't be handled efficiently by free markets.  
@_date: 2018-10-04 09:45:19
I don't take any socialist or communist who relies on a strong state serious. Wolff is one of those who has understood that central control is not what socialism should or was meant to be.  
it sounds counterintuitive for most, but libertarians and socialists have common objects like maximizing peace and individual freedom. and both must refer to decentralization.  
Bitcoin can bring decentralization of money and both ideologies should be in favor of that.  
@_date: 2018-10-02 09:22:07
if I understand your question correctly you are asking why hashrate is increasing despite price decreasing.  
mining is a longterm investment. it's not as flexible as the price. also it's a speculation. if you are already invested in mining it might still be profitable to mine just above the variable cost, as you make your profit in future when prices are higher again.  
difficulty adjustment is inherent as it makes sure blocks are created every 10min and not faster or slower. as an effect block rewards per time do not increase or decrease.

Bitcoin won't exclude anyone. It' public money for everyone. It takes the money creation monopoly away from the banks and that is as revolutionary as it can get. If Bitcoin doesn't keep its properties because of institutional investors it is honestly not fit as public money and has to be changed accordingly.

that rich people are better off is always true. working poor though get wage cuts due to inflation. that's one reason why you need unions in the first place.
well sitting on your cash is still worse than investing it. hoarding would increase profit rates (interest rates) on investments. So the incentive to invest will still be there.  
also hoarding reduces prices on consumer goods (deflation) which gives a natural incentive for spending, which again will ensure rather stable prices on the market.  
a deflation spiral can not happen in a bitcoin economy as it's not debt money.

There is a lot of money flowing into real estate just to park it or to speculate on a further expanding bubble. This money can flow into Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin will definitely reduce housing prices, which are way way too high. First drawing capital from real estate into Bitcoin and secondly, once fiat ceases to exist there will be no credit money anymore to inflate prices. This would be endame, and one of the most important things to achieve. Affordable homes for people.

I know "fast and cheap" is not a main property, but it will be as there is a lot of development focused on it and people like to hear it. It's not dishonest.  
It prevents credit financed bubbles as every credit must be backed 1:1, which prevents at least this kind of crises.  
The privacy part is definitely anticipated. Ressources are going into it and things like LN, Dandelion, Coinjoin etc. will make things more private than any centralized system will ever be.  
So from my point of view and ofc some anticipation it is not dishonest.

@_date: 2018-06-25 09:54:16
that's why 'hodlin' and 'get rich quick' is very useful. it brings bitcoin to price levels that reduce volatility.  
also merchants have an incentive to adopt btc anyway. no fee and they can easily sell the coins immediately in order to mitigate a loss.  
so the consumer 'hodls' and 'gets rich quick' and the merchants safe the fees. this can build a good basis for critical mass of adoption.

If you are objective and disect fiat, you can say fiat is very flexible in taking every economic opportunity that arises. If there is an opportunity that promises to pay at least the interest on top of clearance you will get a credit.   
with bitcoin on the other hand saver must supply the credit. shortages on credit increases interest rates and therefore only very profitable opportunities get served. If you have a small business that makes 3% EBIT, which is still profitable you might not get a credit.  
bitcoin doesn't remove debt. It's a widespread generalization that fiat is debt slavery and bitcoin would free us from it. debt will still exist, but now the economy depends on the rich savers to give loans. This creates a new delicate situation.  
The debt created in fiat is also from savings, but savings from the future, as you have to pay clearance. In this regards it simply accelerates the economy, but brings of course other problems like bubbles and more malinvestments.  
I'd like this to be discussed objectively with a scientific spirit. I think Bitcoin as vehicle for austrian economics is not its obligation. We need a new form of credit system which is dynamic but doesn't destory the sound money property, which is kind of squaring the circle.

I honestly don't think so. Ethereum is the worse SoV, so 'no one' wants to store value in ETH. It's IN do the operation you want and OUT into Bitcoin as fast as possible. That procedure is objectively nonsense. If Ethereum will be a thing in the future you will represent value and pay transactions with Bitcoin.  
Ethereum is not money and it should not try to be one.

did you make clear why you are so sure bitcoin is not invincible? double standard?
Bitcoin is said to be the most attacked network ever and wasn't hacked once in 9 years. The network will probably never be down and no one can stop you to transfer funds. Also Bitcoin is under colluded social attacks by bcash and fiat and it doesn't give a fuck. It's pretty much invincible.

you can definitely have a fixed supply with PoS. no reason for premine or a dev stack.  
 problem with PoS as I see it is:  
1) it's a built in snowball system. as staker you acquire an increasing stack of the token supply by simply doing nothing and adding nothing. In PoW you have to put money 'into' the system (energy) from the outside to make a profit on a very competetive market. ofc if you are rich already you can build huge mining farms, but this all comes with entrepreneurial risk.  
2) in PoS you are securing the network with its own value. holding the token is a weapon to attack the network once you acquire enough. also once you have 51% of the supply no one can change that. in PoW you again secure the network by putting network independent value from the outside into the system. acquiring 51% of the hashrate is possible, but you are not locked into that position. anyone can increase his hashrate to reduce your share below 51%.  
so PoW is a way to seperate the network from its security while PoS merges the network and security aspect. which in my current view makes PoS a no go.

A has a channel with B

as I said we are talking about actual usage/adoption.  
my point is not, that altcoins are gerally bad or useless. my point is that btc has by far the most 'real world' tx. which makes most if not all altcoins at this point in time irrelevant in this regard. I mean even bitcoin 'real world' tx are very low. I don't know how many but we know that acceptance is very low still. But if I see mechants accepting crypto it's always Bitcoin and mostly Bitcoin only.  
that's the whole point of Samourai stating why they only developing a Bitcoin wallet.

I think the value offered to the market is important not the amount of coins. with increasing price the (value) supply doesn't necessarily shrink. that might be the reason why we see a slowdown in growth on the log chart. it get's harder to get new people into Bitcoin as it currently 'just' represents monetary policy, about which the average person doesn't care.  
I forsee a massive acceleration in the next years when Bitcoin has scaled enough to become a convenient payment system which triggers an additional network effect. Most people (who don't own Bitcoin right now) just care about daily use, not the policy behind it.

to my understanding LN can't be used for such an attack. (can be wrong to some extend)
1) you receive sats on reddit (managed internally).  
2) you send an LN invoice to pull the funds to your LN wallet.  
now the trace is already lost, as the invoice is not pointing on an UTXO that could be traced. (LN doesn't use UTXOs)
3a) you send your funds via LN. not traceable. at least not without nodes colluding heavily.  
3b) you close your channel with the new channel state. you perfom one tx and create one new UTXO. the sender on reddit has no knowledge about that UTXO because he didn't directly 'create' it by sending sats to one of your addresses.
@_date: 2019-10-03 09:24:37
very dependent on what happens on the world stage. will events happen that fuel this revolution of finance or will it be surpressed (slowed down)?  
If the economic crisis is delayed to 2021 and the S&amp;P as reference sets new ATH, Bitcoin might go to 20-30k. If the hell breaks loose Bitcoin might go to 50-100k or higher after an immense drop. If a Bitcoin bug inflates the supply we go to $1-10 (without a k).

a cool idea in general, but everyone running a node to have an authenticator is unrealistic imho. It should be anonymous and trustless with a service node, which on top better hides your identity as proxy than a node from your IP...I guess

it must be less private as the rod node must know you are the final receiver of the funds. in this case it'd be not a satisfying final solution.

i came to the conclusion that we will need at least two layers.  
- one fully anonymous if ur identity is irrelevant for the contract partner.  
- one where your digital identity can be 100% verified for cases ur contract partner needs to know who you are and needs to law enforce in case you break the deal. (e.g. loans, tax).  
let's be real. You won't lend anyone money if you can't ensure he doesn't rip you off. I at least must be able to sue a person that breaks laws/contracts

not that I don't like Cardano, but I think every token that tries to represent monetary value will fail. Bitcoin is the UoA in crypto. It started with exchanges where BTC is the value reference and it will further spread into the ecosystem outside the exchanges.

it's easy to create a coin, yes. it's hard to get the hashrate from the miners. there are billions invested in mining equipment which secure the network. it costs immense amounts of money just to pull off one double spend attack on bitcoin.

UBI in some form is inevitable. I think it should be financed by fully automated DAOs. Is rather a vision for in 10-20 years, but my thought process behind it is simple.  
Humans run businesses for profit. Machines have no profit motive. they can run a company (in a field that fits their capabilities) at lowest cost, make a profit and distribute it in society. All it needs is some altruistic humans to kickstart it and such a 'company' would outcompete any profit driven company with ease.  
This is how I can imagine a sustainable and efficient UBI that's not fixed but varies with actual earnings of the DAOs

people are just not used to protect sensitive data. Your comment is like saying companies will never connect to the internet as it's a attack vector on their valuable data. Still they did and invest in security. Sometimes successfully, sometimes not.  
It's actually easy to have and use a hardware wallet. Also in the future people will probably simply use third parties in conjunction with 2/3 multisig to secure their funds. full control and still easily managable if you want to lock your wallet in case of loss of you smartphone or whatever. call a number and tell'em to not sign any further transactions.

leveraged longs. like you give 1 BTC and borrow another 10 BTC to go long with 11 BTC. But you have to give the 10 BTC back. 1 BTC is your collateral. If the price drops 10% you get liquidated because you need the 1 BTC to cover the losses on your borrowed 10 BTC. When you get liquidated you automatically sell the 10 BTC which pressures price further down. That's why we have such price jumps. market is still too small.

probably also depends on the situation in the mining industry. if profit was low before the halving the new supply sold at market gets drastically reduced after the halving. if the profit was very high before the halving and still is after halving the supply doesn't change much.

the SF model is based on scarcity and not the network effect of Bitcoin.

it's not a dichotomy between market or state. that's 20th century thinking.  
You simply have to be careful if you explore austrian economics. Libertarians highjack the school of thinking and they are radicals just as (real) socialists. They do not accept any other answer than "muh free muhrkut!!"  
the free market has no ethics. It's based on material advantage. If your ethics can't be used to increase the economic pie the market will not provide a solution. 
Example 1:  
The market starts to offer electric (green) cars because environmental ethics require that. That's a kind of ethic you can make money from if you follow the demand.  
Example 2:
The market doesn't give a shit if people suffer and suicide in factories in china or whereever. There is no demand for "ethically" produced smartphones. So the market doesn't solve the problem of unbearable work conditions.  
Example 3:
The market doesn't include external cost. Companies calculate with costs in money. If they can dump their waste for free in a river many will do it, externalizing the costs.  
You don't necessarily need a central state to solve this, but a normal market will ever act on profit signals.

you are exaggerating my statement and vision. I am not speaking of a total autonomous economy, only certain fields which are fit for such OS endeavours.

no altcoin has proven to scale better than Bitcoin at the same security and decentralization level. don't get fooled. they buy scalabilty by giving up the most important features.  
also Bitcoin is scaling with trade-offs on additional layers (Lightning Network, Liquid Sidechain etc.). Scaling is difficult and don't let others tell you otherwise.

Android wallet Samourai can do it for example.
it can also adjust the fee after sending the tx as long as it's pending. used usually to increase fee if your tx rottens in the mempool, which is currently not very likely.

1) an holding that goes 2x in a year is still absolute top notch.

the model only makes sense if it's not fiat devaluation adjusted. means when SFR hits infinity in 2140 the Bitcoin price would be infinite as well. ofc that can't be true in terms of purchasing power. But it can be true in terms of fiat, as fiat can go to zero.
@_date: 2019-08-18 13:13:21
exactly. Percentagewise it was the weakest. The foundation for the climb was better and all.  
But if you like, keep your CME narrative even though retail who bought Bitcoin and brought it to 20k do not even understand what CME/Futures is. And if they understood they would know that cash settled futures have no influence on Bitcoin's price, except for manipulation by whales shorting while dumping their BTC on the market.

for example yes. but this will happen way earlier imho. in 120 years, I think money will be used differently. production of goods will be highly decentralized and automated (evolution of 3D printer) and money will mostly just be used for spam protection. material goods will be so cheap that market prices won't exist for many goods. so what we need then is to prevent spam orders.

as I understand it's not more efficient in terms of data volume, but in using blockspace over time as the inclusion into a block of a part of the data gets delayed to a point when blocks aren't full anyway. it just smooths out blockspace usage, which makes it in deed more efficient feewise.

altcoiners are attacking BTC continuously for their own gain. Ofc this triggers defence.  
I am not mainly focused on Bitcoin because I need the tribalism. I am focused on BTC because I have my view about how things can realistically play out.  
I think because of the ICO hype 2017 the ecosystem is disturbed and must be restructured. I think that ETH was the wrong baselayer for alternative coins because Ether is not money. In my view the internet of value must be based on Bitcoin and altcoins that fulfill other functions must use Bitcoin everywhere where value is represented or transfered so those altcoins (or better altnets) can focus on their actual idea.

I think BCH and its unlimited blocks have a far greater scaling issue.  letting the blocksize grow unrestricted means a bad propertie takes over and that is network entrance cost. Not regarding buying stakes but getting into mining and nodes. If decentralization and low participating costs are a core value, unsrestricted blocks are its enemy. blocks will be increased in the future, but not unrestricted. 
in my oppinion devs should think about a 'decentralization index algorithm' which can asses the meassure of decentralization and can decide how big the blocks may be.

"how I lost 4 BTC on the Bitcoin network"  
1) typed wrong address  
2) lost keys  
3) lost phone, no seed backup  
4) PC hacked  
5) you name it
honestly the warnings are out there to not use LN with high amounts as it is still experimental. backups are still an issue. also you must use customized software to have capacity of 4 BTC, so you should know what your are doing.  meme ftw

In a Bitcoin world (nominal) returns will be much lower on diversified investments. It would actually be good to tend towards zero at a certain level of diversification as the longterm risk tends towards zero as well. A meritocracy doesn't allow riskless returns (only from deflation on savings). It's a pyramid scheme if you can earn 200k/year doing nothing.

like I said it will be resolved by an economic crisis, once we 'found' the trigger that contracts the money supply, because QE is undoubtly an unnatural state.  
hyperinflation in Germany didn't happen within a day. this time you have actual alternatives to flee to. back then this all wasn't as obvious and easy to dodge.  
my point simply was that going all in on Bitcoin and not holding any EUR is a play with fire as it is right now. the risk staying in EUR might increase and favor Bitcoin at some point.

it's not cherry picked data. dunno who you come to that conclusion.
bitcoin is the only network with real usage. if other cryptos with the same scarcity would successfully rise they would share the monetary premium explained by this model. It just doesn't make much sense to have two monies with the same properties.  
so you are right. there is one ingredient missing and that's people creating demand for a particular scarce asset. without this trust-level or network effect in a particular asset this model can't work.

running a validating node is essentially doing nothing. and if you are wealthy you can freeze funds without a problem and collect 'interest'. that's plannable. 


If Bitcoin is brought down this way your mining rigs will be worthless. all PoW coins running the same algo will be considered attacked if Bitcoin is successfully attacked rendering them worthless as well.
Keeping up a PoW attack is extremely costly. keeping up a PoS attack costs nothing but ofc the potential loss of value of the token. so if you have the conviction to attack, no matter what, the PoS coin will be under permanent attack without additional costs and needs a very ugly hard with a roll back and isolating the attacker (seizing his funds). the network is not neutral anymore.
In case of PoW you can at least counter attack by activating new/inactive hash rate. in case of a necessary hard fork you can change the algo, rendering the mining equipment worthless, but do not touch any funds. the miners are rekt(!) but the network stays neutral. this give every miner an incentive to keep watch that no other miner is able to 51% attack. you can't do this in PoS.

1. little deflation would be fair as it rewards savings. If you save you effectively leave ressources for others to comsume for a cheaper price.  
2. private debt is irrelevant as it's non-productive. if you take a private loan, your problem.  
3. business loans are relevant as the money borrowed shall increase the output of the society in the future and therefore benefit everyone. deflation is bad for such loans as nominal revenue shrinks over time. means you need very profitable investment opportunities for such loans. which again means, the probability of malinvestment is much lower.

the thing is, a breaking bug will probably destroy all value you have in Bitcoin and if you are not online and aware when it happens you won't be able to sell in time. very low risk but total loss.

FaceCoin will not be the last and only one eventuall. While a cashless society without a decentralized system looks dark, Bitcoin will not lose against this. People will always have a way to switch to Bitcoin and they will at the latest when pressure gets to high.
there might be several problems along the way though. If major countries collude to prohibit Bitcoin acceptance by merchants, adoption will be hindered massively. But I don't think this will happen. Huge parts of the world are actually fed up by US dominance and will not simply support FaceCoin by prohibiting public crypto like Bitcoin.

weekly is better for better averaging. in regards of gains it depends:  
in a bullmarket it's better to do it montly, because otherwise you miss out on gains in the weeks you are holding the fiat back.  
in a bear market weekly is better for the opposite reason.  
the question is now are we really in a long term bullmarket already?

It's not about hoarding it's about saving to invest. We live in a paradigm of 'low savings' and 'high consumption' in order to increase velocity for the capitalists which have the benefit of the first credit receiver. Consumption for the sake of consumption. That's what I call stupid and dysfunctional. A system that has to be wasteful in order to provide jobs is nothing to strive for.
A stable supply currency rewards saving as it rewards consumption while a FIAT currency rewards overly consumption. I want to have a choice and not to be forced to invest in risky/volatile assets just to beat inflation.

money, contracts, virtual owenership in general


that's a hard one, because as long Bitcoin has huge upside only a few want to spend it. Everyone is prefering to spend their fiat before BTC. 
imho the best way to prepare Bitcoin for being a payment system is:  
1) Bitcoin debit cards: People can hold all cash in Bitcoin and pay with the debit card which pays the merchant in fiat. This way people can conveniently transition to holding Bitcoin only.  
2) Demand from shops to integrate processors (PoS) like coingate (BTC-&gt;FIAT) or BTCpay (BTC) that support LN  
3) Support LN in adoption and building if you are a programmer.


imho Andreas Antonopolous is the best convenient source for general information. (books + youtube channel)

This. You should have an huge independent channel to receive payrolls.  
Another solution might be that employers open channels via channel factories for all their employees every month anew. Then you can send as much as you want to your independent channel. This way you would be sure your independet channel does have enough capacity.  
But honestly, I think channel management will be very different in 2-3 years. What's a hassle today will be a breeze.

as the word network in LN says it is a network. you can send funds to anyone with a LN enabled Bitcoin wallet as long there is a route to that receiver. (at certain size pretty much a given) the money then hops from channel to channel until it's at its destination. trustless and very private as the nodes/channels forwarding your payment do not know who the originator was and who the final receiver is going to be.  
means you should at least have one channel open to a routing node. those nodes who agree to route payments make themself public as advertized nodes
A has a channel to B  
B has a channel to A and C  
C has a channel to B   
A &lt;--&gt; B &lt;--&gt; C  
A can now pay C

miners at least partially sell their rewards. after the halving they have less Bitcoin to sell. means less supply at same demand equals higher price.  
it depends on the price, the mining costs and how much miners actually hodl instead of selling at the point of halving. you can't simply assume supply pressure get's halved.

A stable supply currency gives reason to thoughtful consumption. Ever thought about the reasons why we still have to work &gt;40hours a week while being several times more productive than 50y ago? One big reason is a shit ton of useless bullshit we buy and throw away.

1) spread is a delta between buy and sell price. So you get a little higher price when buying and lower price when selling  
2) you can't compare the exchanges like that because they have seperate price discovery and the price is not the same at the same time. Next time CashApp could offer a worse price.
@_date: 2019-06-12 09:36:56
don't forgetto pull out. please compare the top at the last halving pf LTC in 2015. it was 1.5 months before the actual halving and the halving itself was the price bottom.
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:27:56
yeah 30-40% retrace is reasonable. but if we go parabolic to ATH this usual pattern may not apply. it could be worse and burn normies once again.

a deflationary spiral is defined by bankruptcy chain reaction. In a fiat system all positive balances have a liability as counterpart. the liabilities are nominal. a deflation increases the real value of debt while decreasing the nominal value of revenue. this lets companies go bankrupt.  
in an equity based system you have real positive balances without liabilities. this makes it robust against deflation.

@_date: 2019-02-17 10:01:10
my thesis:  
the slowdown is explained by the network effect of the SoV function. the marginal utility with the growing SoV network declines.  
If LN keeps growing at the current rate and increases adoption the network effect of the MoE function will be added on top. the marginal utility will be very high in the beginning and potentially accelerates Bitcoin again. additionally if LN is a success the currency altcoin market will shrink relative to Bitcoin.

I think you must differentiate two different effects:  
1) Phase of wealth transfer to Bitcoin. 'going from 0 to 10M'  
2) The actual usage of a decentralized sound monetary system after 1) is completed. This is what Bitcoin stands for, not 1)
peope who get rich in 1) won't stay rich if they can't manage money. for some 1) won't have a lasting effect and is actually not what Bitcoin stands for. the transfer phase is just a necessary step to get this thing going.
2) is way more important in the long run for people as they can reliably store the value of their work. no one can steal it from them by financial politics. no one can confiscate it and everyone can be a 'global corporation'. It won't mean paradise by any means, but I think it will be a huge improvement for humanity, especially outside the western world.
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:27:05
I agree with you except at the stage we are you can consider it investing because Bitcoin lives from its growing usebase and with buying Bitcoin you support that growth.

It can't be both right now because it needs to go into the millions per BTC first. it's not rational to spend a money that's rising in value that quickly.  
you can argue that if we had solved the scalong problem completely already more and more people would go allin Bitcoin and apply 'spend&amp;replace' which would accelerate hyperbitcoinization. but you may not forget that it's still a technical risk as we still apply upgrades to the code.

 widespread payrolls alone would congest the mempool. You need a LN solution for that.  
payrolls might come before MoE adoption though, as serious MoE adoption can pnly happen ones Bitcoin has stablized at much higher levels. MoE adoption might still grow if more and more people start to have all their cash stored in BTC, which forces them to spend BTC.
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:23:40

it stops the control over the money supply, which is a huge leverage against anyone who is in your way. the state must finance solely through taxes and be transparent and efficient with its expenditures. financing of war is impossbile if people are not willing to finance it. there is a lot Bitcoin can potentially do to a global society.

1) less decentralization on LN is not as bad as on the base layer.  
2) AMP as one of the earlier innovations for LN already helps the decentralization as it is unproblematic to fund multiple channels except for highee fees which should still be negligble. why? because micropayments won't need AMP and larger payments that use AMP justify a fee of 1cent or so.

the bug was not exploited and it was fixed immediately. bugs are possible, no question. that's one reason why ossification will set in more and more to not introduce a critical flaw in the base layer.  
we were talking about miners reward and that we can't know yet what will happen. Bitcoin as multi-layered system will evolve and we have to see what happens along the way. 2140 is a long time away.

afaik running a LN node makes no sense without running a BTC full node.
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:27:09
no it's different than 'usual' inflation. in case of fiat it steals value through dilution. in crypto a new curreny steals value by people switching the network e.g. by market valuation. it's a market decision to adopt the new crypto and leave Bitcoin behind.  
for the holders it has the same effect if Bitcoin loses value through this process, that's true, but it is not inflation because people only switch network if it's better money. also you can follow to the new network and make gains if it grows. you can't do that when a fiat curreny gets inflated.
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:33:01
while this is true and you can't assume actual supply sold on the market is halving, we don't know yet what the circumstances will be. as supply gets halved nontheless the longterm effect must be positive for price assuming damand doesn't drop.

@_date: 2019-06-17 00:22:36
they can sell it and crash the market by 80%. nothing we didn't live through already several times.  
if they just want to have monetary power they would actually push Bitcoin to victory. the respective state would have 5% of all coins in existence and with privacy coming to Bitcoin they could wash it and disguise the ownership, but still have high economic weight.  
 All we could do is a fork which blocks addresses from 2009 if a huge majority agrees. But this had to be done soon and won't happen as it violates the core principles. only when it's too late people would agree.

scalability: Nano didn't fix it. it trades decentralization and security for throughput, not to mention that its tps still isn't enough.  
volatility: no new money can become stable before it reached a high level of adoption. DAI is pegged to the Dollar. it's not a stable cryptocurrency in itself. so what you say is we should stay with the Dollat, which is an oxymoron  
privacy: yes. it's in the works though. you probably gonna have good opt-in privacy on the base layer, sidechains and Lighting. not unsolvable.  
environment: same as with nano. it's a trade off. you have to use flawed or at least unproven consensus models to get rid of the energy usage. Bitcoins security does not depend on the amount of energy used, but on the amount of value spend. if energy cost rise, energy usage will go down at almost the same security. Miners always want to use the cheapest energy available. make it renewables and especially excess energy which would be otherwise wasted and the environmental impact is much lower. also Bitcoin replaces other systems that use energy.

no. the loaned money can be spent without inflation as it must get into circulation before it can start creating price inflation. The interest you pay is partly eaten by inflation and also you got money for doing nothing for immediate spending, while others save to spend later. But as you are an asshole you simply take a loan and rob the savers.

a normal blocksize increase is a hard fork. unlikely to ever happen.  
I am unsure if the blockweight of SegWit could be further tweaked to increase blocksize via a soft fork. that'd be realistic to happen within the next 4 years and could be done quickly assuming quick adoption.

The economy should work to fulfill our needs right? But the paradigm we live in is that we shall consume in order to support the economy. Isn't that a perversion?
We have a distorted goal system imho. we look at GDP and unemployment to evaluate the wealth of a society. imho what we seek is happiness which is the greatest wealth you can have. For that the economy must serve the people and not the other way around.

misconception. deflation is a huge problem for fiat systems not for equity based money systems (like gold and Bitcoin).  
why?  
In fiat every Dollar in existence is equivalent to one Dollar debt. every account is mirrored by a liability. As all debt is accounted for nominally a deflation increases the real value of debt by reducing nominal revenue. prices nominally go down but debt doesn't! This creates a spiral of bankruptcies.  
In a equity based system credit still plays a role, but to a far lesser extend that deflation bares no systemic risk.

That said, Musk also pointed out aspects of the industry that are keeping his companies from getting involved in using and applying the technology.
Speaking to the downsides of cryptocurrency, in the case of bitcoin for instance, he said he believes its use of a large computing network to secure its ledger is “computationally energy intensive.” He added that, for a company that aims to boost the adoption for sustainable energy, it may not be “a good use of Tesla’s resources to get involved in crypto.”

Many are working on it for years already. The BTC devs are actually taking the hard paths, namely data compression (increasing capacity on-chain) and things like sidechains (drivechain) and LN. Such are long term projects which need obvisouly time. Such changes have to be the focus right now because it takes years to make it a full fledged solution.
A blocksize increase is lazy, bad for decentralization and can be done anytime. I don't see how we need to take such a measure now in order to be considerate of future users.

exactly. channel stays open. the downside for now is capacity. you can only receive as much funds as you have capacity. but your employer might wanne open the channel with you which gives you the needed capacity. merchants also will need huge capacity, otherwise they would have to loop out to often.  
I mean you could simply open a channel with let's $10k then loop out 9k which leaves you with huge capacity but only 1k in a hot wallet. (i guess that would work)
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:31:17

dude just in 2018 an inflation bug was detected. it was descretely disclosed by a bcash dev to the core devs and fixed before it was announced publicly. as long as the base laser geta updated we gonna have risks to bear. that's why it's important that ossification increases with time and reduces the risk to nearly zero.  
I don't believe in total and uncontrolled destruction of major currencies like USD and EUR. the only thing that could happen surprisingly is the a currency reform which won't be announced much time before it gets resolved. In any other case I think if you are vigilant you gonna have enough time to react.

free markets work well in many cases but not all. free markets get especially out of hand as soon as you have concentration of power (centralization). therefore I see decentralization as huge step forward, even though it's still very vague and abstract what it will be like.  
essentially capitalism was also a decentralization of power. as it has centralizing tendencies we again have to make a leap towards more decentralization. it might be the renaissance 2.0

LN works outside of Bitcoin. You lock up funds in a smart contract on the Bitcoin blockchain, which then can be moved around off-chain.  
It's like going into the Casino, locking up funds at the cashier (getting chips), playing all evening long and when you leave you settle your balance at the cashier again. (except that on LN it's actual bitcoin you are using and not an altcoin/chips or something plus you don't have to leave)  
I've used it several times. Worked flawlessly so far, even though it's far from feature complete. if you are into computer games you can pay via LN on  or  As wallet you could use BlueWallet, which is easy to use but custodial. But for testing just fine.

on the UI level you talk about you can't do things that weren't possible before. sending money is possible today and there is no difference to crypto for the average user in that regard. you could also do smart contracts on conventional databases. no need for crypto.
Crypto was always useless to the average user. you make it seem like it were different in the past when you say 'was'. but it gets interesting for more and more people because of its underlying properties. at some point the average user will see value in it because he will get even more sensible than 2008 when the next 1% attack hits the economy.

deflation is bad in a fiat system because it's solely based on debt. The debt is accounted nominally. Deflation increases the real value of debt and ruins all corporate balance sheets which leads to mass insolvency.  
this can't happen in an equity based system.

FIAT does reallocate ressources but it's not actually increasing ressources. As you need no consent by the ressource holders to reallocate ressources the risk of misallocation is probably much higher. Only in endeavors like conventional wars this mechanism brings an advantage of one country over the other in the short term.  
So FIAT has advantages like a dictatorship has advantages over a democracy. Doubtful.

money stock is about $100T alone. we may not forget that people partially only invest in real estate and other assets to escape inflation. which ironically inflates asset prices. buying existing stock of real estate helps no one as it physically changes nothing but makes housing for ordinary people less affordable.  
it would be an advantage for society if more people could hold their wealth in Money. Real estate would become much cheaper and improve lifes of people and families for real.

I figure it's not that easy. in case of a inflation bug and given new privacy features you might not be able to trace the created coins and exclude them from the airdrop. so you need to rollback the chain, nullifying all legit transactions in the process and remine them, presuming you can exclude the addresses you know where involved in the exploit. this would be a hell of a mess man. many will lose trust in the system.

'using Bitcoin' is like saying 'using Dollar (FIAT)'. Bitcoin is mainly a new form of money and not a processor.  
BTCpay, Bitpay, coingate...those are free to choose processors for Bitcoin you can compare with Visa, MasterCard and so forth.

I am also really curious for a solution to this problem. The only approach I came up with until now is that deflation has somehow to become the new money creating process. So we are left with two things. 
1) Lending only happens with existing bitcoins  
2) The more efficient the economy gets the higher the value of 1 BTC becomes (goods become cheaper). This results in increased savings by the people as they are not incentivized to spend everything on consumption due to inflation. Means deflation can free up ressources to be invested by the people themself leading to ever increasing passive income, which would go wonderfully hand in hand with automation of all economic systems. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 10:31:08
@_date: 2019-02-26 09:46:08

@_date: 2019-02-20 19:54:00

1) there is no last block. It's only the reward that that will be zero in 2140 (miners still earn fees), which leads us to 2).  
2) as the reward gets halved every 4 years Bitcoin has a counter balance to increasing market value. This slows energy consumption down, so there won't be infinite energy consumption. The system just has to make sure it is expensive enough to attack it. Also Bitcoin isn't backed by energy consumption. The energy consumption increases with price and not the other way around.  
3) maybe pool-mining can be decentralized in order to make sure the hashrate isn't arbitrarily moved to another chain for attacks. the current structure of mining surely is not perfect but probably good enough and with some add-ons as mentioned above it could be improved.

it's actually not backed by nothing. It's backed by borrowers promise to add value to the ressources allocated to him in one form or another. Also you can't invest "realized money" considering the whole system. no credit no money.   
and that's the point. how can bitcoin sufficiently allocate ressources to promising endevours.

In this particular case surely.
A full blown environment of negative interest rates will only happen if cash gets abolished, which is planned for a long time already. You can't sit on the cash then because you'll have to pay interest on your balance.
People will invest especially in real estate and this will inflate asset prices. In consequence more and more people can get more money on their inflated real estate value. Then the bubble pops and everyone has to pay back the loan, but their real estate is suddenly only worth &lt;70%. Many will be burned and ruined!
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:20:42

@_date: 2019-06-17 18:45:36
1) ofc Bitcoin being a SoV and MoE is simply an agreement. not by decree but voluntarily by the market. if Bitcoin manages to soak up most of the monetary value in the world there will be zero risk in holding the purest form of money that ever existed. at that point no one rational would allow himself to deny payment in Bitcoin. industrial use would be comforting as of now but as a grown monetary system it's even better without alternative uses.

MW and LN are two different things though. MW brings privacy by default, has no transaction amount limits and can scale very well. I think it definitely has a place in crypto and should be tested which is done by GRIN, BEAM and now LTC is also following.

Bitcoin has 2-digit drops regularly. It never spiraled to zero because someone dumping his BTC doesn't cause a change to the fundamentals and people will just stack cheap sats.  
if anything a whale dumping his coins helps distributing the wealth more equally.

sure. the only way to stop bitcoin is convincing the revolutionaries (hodlers) that it's worthleas. we might be past the point though. Bitcoin is socially backed by many famous people already of which no one represents bitcoin, which means there is almost no attack surface.

I'll take a further price inceases happily, but I won't see it as a true personal achievement eventhough I'd feel some pride proving others wrong.

If it requires a hard fork (of which I am not sure) yes. But adding decimal places won't be contentious at all compared to raising the supply.

traditional lending will be less common. investing in form of equity share will be more common. and yes much of it can be P2P via decentralized platforms.

1) it's not 1000 people but 1000 addresses which also includes exchanges which hold funds of their customers.  
2) you simply can't destroy Bitcoin by selling. Bitcoin might drop 90% and then it will recover as the fundamentals stay the same or are even improving because you got rid of a whale.

I partially disagree on the "anachist direction". while we can have way more freedom and fewer laws, I think law enforcement will become digitalized and way more rigid, meaning not possible/easy to circumvent. If Bitcoin is the start just think of its rules enforcement. You have practically no chance to bend the rules of the protocol.

to be serious Bitcoin raises a TON of questions about how the economy would work:  
- deflationary currency  
- no money creation for loans  
questions that follow:  
- how do companies gather enough capital for investments?  
- how are investments decisions made under deflationary conditions?
- how does it change accounting? Under deflationary conditions NOMINAL deficits might become normal. Do we have to change to "relative value accounting"?

why is 2% good? Even keynsians don't say it's good. the 2% is a safety buffer to not slip into deflation. why is that? because all fiat money is debt at the same time and in case of deflation the debt burden increases and crushes everyone. an equity based economy doesn't have this problem.

that's not the root problem. The root problem is the tandem of concentration of capital (corp.) protected and favoured by the state. These go together since the 'beginning of time'. That's why I think we need completely new organizational forms that destroy the current hierachies and decentralize the power. Capitalism and the nation state did actually the same. It got us to a higher grade of decentralization of power from monarchies and the church. Time for the next level.

1. how is deflation a problem? the economy should serve the people and provide what they need and want. keynsianism turns the logic on its head and says people shall serve the economy and spend as much as they can. I think a society that has a real decision between saving and spending is much saner than one that consumes for consumptions sake.
2. the housing market is inflated by credit which makes housing much more expensive, so you have to load on much more debt. there is no free lunch.

In a deflation nominal revenues go down and companies can't pay their nominal debt even though they are not necessarily making less money in real terms. This is a problem of a nominal debt based system. In a Bitcoin system equity/shares would be predominant, as it is flexible to deflation/inflation, which allows the economy to stay stable.  
The deflation spiral is actually a bug in the code of economic law so to say.

imho great. It's going faster than I expected actually.  
- Network grew like &gt;20% per month over the last 1.5y, which actually has to slow down because otherwise we would have all Bitcoin in LN by 2023 or so.  
- used it quite often. I actually guess I have more LN transactions than on-chain transaction by now. never failed me and feels great to have that instant transfer.  
- alpha versions of Loop IN/OUT, Watchtowers and autopilot are about to get released. afaik with the next Bitcoin Upgrade Watchtowers won't be needed anymore as SIGHASH_NOINPUT gets implemented and there will be no need to surveil the channel state. AMP and Splicing will be surely next and make LN much cheaper and easier to handle.  
- there is a new proposal called "Statechain" which might enable us to open channels without on-chain transaction instantly. Comes with trust trade-offs and is in very early state though. Curious to see what will happen on that front.

you carry quite some misconceptions:  
- stablecoins are a bridging technology. like internet through telephone copper wire.  
- the volatility of Bitcoin decreases with adoption. just imagine Bitcoin capturing 100% of the money market and you see it can't be volatile anymore. volatility is a meassure of opportunity. the higher the adoption, the lower the opportunity, the lower the volatility.  
- tx/s are not dependent on mining activity due to the difficulty adjustment.  
- Bitcoin is in fact similar to gold with huge advatanges though, because you can have trustless 2nd layers for mass transactions (e.g. Lightning Network) For gold it would always require trust and therefore lead to corruption (see gold backed paper money in the past)

1) the economy should work to produce what people want/need. the logic that we need 2% inflation to incentivize people to spend their money is turning things on its head and acting like people live for the economy instead of the other way around.

because you think it's fueling the economy and creating jobs?  
just imagine the extreme and you'll realize it's not the case if you actually have the sane assumption the economy is there to meet peoples needs and not the other way around.  
If you have a inflation of 100% per day you'd be prone to spent your money immediately. Any purchase of choice would be better than holding cash. Means your marginal utility per $ spend will tend to go near zero, means you are wasting ressources (materials and most importantly human time). Inflation is only good for creditors and those who leverage their business with it.

It's the same for on-boarding on the base layer. you need at least 1 tx to get your coins. the aftermath is worse tho because every following transaction would have to be on-chain as well.

this comes close to reality. as Bitcoin will also be a low risk deflationary store of value quite some value from real estate, stocks and other assets which are bought to counteract inflation, will be transfered to Bitcoin. $5M/btc is rather a low estimate if hyperbitcoinization happens.

yes. you lock-up coins in 2/2 multisig smart contract on Bitcoin. then you transfer as much as you want off-chain. in the end you 'agree' to close the smart contract with the party you opened it with the new balance after the off-chain transactions. the coins in the smart contract will then be distributed to you both accordingly on-chain.

BitPay is taking the risk for the receiver in case the transaction is invalid. that's why it's so 'fast'.

@_date: 2019-12-02 19:55:47
Conventional banks (not bank-like institutions) will disappear because the holding of your Bitcoin can be as or more secure without storing them at a bank. 
Colaborative and institutional Multi-Sig will be a big thing. For example: You will simply setup multi-sig with other users or bank-like companies. you will set an max amount they will automatically sign. If the tx exceeds the amount, they will not sign or require further authorization. If you lose your phone/wallet you can block any transcations by changing the max amount to zero. 
your coins are totally safe and still in your full possession. and the UX is similar to current systems.

we need one coin to be the UoA though. otherwise you don't get rid of volatility. If Bitcoin is the UoA all other coins/tech must be pegged to Bitcoin in a verifiable way (e.g. side-chains).

@_date: 2019-12-27 00:20:22
when we talk of inflation we mean price inflation not stock inflation. price inflation can be local in spending classes (consumer goods, assets etc.). that being said. it only produces price inflation in consumer goods if the money increases demand for those goods faster than supply can keep up. (assuming it's financed mostly by taxes and not simply printed)
@_date: 2019-12-14 22:10:53
As far as I can tell it's very well related because Bitcoin is not a regular investment and you can't know how deterministic its development is. I suspect it's golds history in time lapse.

you can't add just any payment system without enabling FRB, except with trust-minimized solutions like LN. saying that banks can handle the payments is too broad and in context of what Bitcoin accomplishes simply wrong.  
I assume though that businesses will only accept such trust-minimized payment networks as it's in their best interest and of highest security.

it's a default channel capacity limit so people can't lose too much money in case of bugs or mistakes. can be removed now by the users and will be increased or removed by default in the future.

no it's not symmetrical. There is always an imbalance between buyers and sellers. If it weren't so the price would not move. just imagine the extreme case in a big enought market, that everyone wants to buy Bitcoin but no one wants to sell. The price of 1 sat would be 'infinite' and fiat would be worthless. Ergo relative value is transfered, but not nominally.

@_date: 2019-12-07 00:30:11
1. you get the dividend on top of deflation. why not?  
2. buying stocks from emissions is a real investment. buying it from the market after emission is not, as it doesn't increase the liquidity of the company for investments but 'fills the private bag' of the previous holder. markets in general will not pump that hard without FIAT, so people are forced to look for fresh opportunities and not stacking Amazon stocks forever.   
3. well-educated jobs tend to be the most interesting ones, so why do a worse paid boring job?  
4. It does not slow down progress in the long run. no, because markets are not artificially pumped by credit bubbles in a Bitcoin system. You usually do not destroy the ressources if companies go bankrupt. In an ongoing credit bubble scheme you actually destroy ressources, because they become useless once the music stops and everyone recognizes the demand wasn't real. sound money means facing harsh reality and act accordingly.

okay so invest in the expectation bitcoin will actually be the currency in the future and be useful for economic activities. that's at least a reason. most people seem only to see numbers crawling upwards and still think of dollars in their pocket. and now if bitcoin in particular doesn't fulfill the promise it will crash inevitable. because for now it has no use in daily activities.

your balance in the wallet consists of UTXOs summed up. everytime you receive a transaction a new UTXO is created. So if you receive a random transaction it's isolated as its own UTXO. If you now send your whole balance to a new address all your previous UTXOs get consolidated into one single UTXO. Which means the guys who send you the dust can now spy on your transactions by following the dust which now "infected" your whole balance. 
Some wallets let you mark UTXOs you don't wanne spend to keep'em isolated.

true. But my peronal hope is that once money is decentralized the management of society (governance) will go through a similar process supported by decentralizing tech. Bitcoin might be the preposition for this, as tax revenue and the efficient spending of it would become way more important.

It's about everything that a decentralized blockchain is bad at.  transactions per seconds, fees and settlement speed.
LN settles within seconds. Has zero or close to zero fees. and can handle way more transactions per seconds. It's not clear yet how many it'll be capable off. Could be thounsands or millions per second.  
Scaling on-chain alone is linear, not enough, and can't ever be faster than now. If you would want to reach 1000 tps on-chain alone you would currently destroy Bitcoin's decentralization and therefore Bitcoin itself.

HODL is important. Bitcoin must suck in all fiat to conquer the world and for that it must be seen as a store of value. becoming a medium of exchange is self-fulfilling once Bitcoin has so much economic mass that there is no way around it.

if anything it encourages pumping asset prices. no one buys a TV because he thinks one year later his money will be worth less. people with higher savings will buy assets though, because for them inflation is in fact a factor. they pump asset prices and make housing for example unaffordable.

@_date: 2019-04-07 09:41:35
with 'real' i meant that the blocksize is decreased in the practical sense that the network effectively has lower throughput.
SegWit acted as a blockksize increase without potentially isolating nodes that do not upgrade. any node can verify SegWit blocks, it depends on the miners if such 'segwit blocks' with SegWit tx are produced in the first place. So it depends on miners if the new consensus will be applied at all.  
in theory you only need one miner to apply the new rules, but the effect would be miniscule, just as with SegWit if no one would adopt it.  
I simply do not see the support for the blocksize decrease to have any effect if offered as an upgrade.
@_date: 2019-12-26 09:21:33

on the other hand there is no doubt that without 'censorship' any platform would become a 'pornhub'.

doesn't have to do anything with the difficulty adjustment. miner rewards get cut in half, means less Bitcoin on supply side. If demand stays the same and supply drops price necessarily goes up.

You as an individual can use Bitcoin as payment system right now. It would be useless if that wasn't possible, lol. so if you say leveling up slowly, I agree. It will be gradually, but it's not that important right now, because Bitcoin goes up in price as it spreads, which 1) disincentivizes spending of Bitcoin and 2) draws speculators to push the price even further. the payment function will be really important when, and only when Bitcoin takes over the world and becomes stable that way.  
If done right your Bitcoin are very hard if not almost impossible to steal. Bitcoin shall be like cash, means fungible and private. that also brings a downside that if someone physically threatens you to give him your keys your coins are gone, just like the $100 bill in your pocket if stolen. that's why custodians in conjunction with multisig wallets will definitly have a place.

He says credit was subordinate to equity based purchases in the past (19th century and before). So that's in line with what I think a Bitcoin Standard would lead to.  But sadly he doesn't expand on the possibilities how Bitcoin and other cryptos might be instruments for equity based financing.  
I imagine you had a rather hard time in the 19th century to find investors. So today with the internet and especially with crypto we might have the instrument to gather money for our businesses on the market place very quickly, easily and cheap. Just upload your accredited (cryptographicaly signed by authorities or whoever might be applicable here) revenue reportings and every human on this planet can buy into your company as a silent partner even with very small amounts.

coinbase has 10 BTC

this has nothing to do with Bitcoin. To derive that the ability of streaming money will result in corporate super-states is more than far fetched. With Bitcoin you have no corporate token and you alone decide where to spend it. 
your conclusions are rather based on AI lead coprorations (which is only a possible scenario at best) and maybe corporate tokens. With such corporate tokens you can steer the flow of money into your corporation and make it hard to move it somehwere else. Bitcoin is the opposite.
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:41:55
no. we'll go down again from here or 6k. I don't agree with Tone Vays that we go as low as 1.8k but I think shitcoins will be crushed and lose another 80-90% from here. When the bullrun starts Bitcoin will have &gt;60% market dominance.

1) no blocksize increase in the near future   
2) segwit adoption must reach &gt;90% first.  
3) data compression (Schnorr) can effectively increase the blocksize by another 30-50% (more tx in one block)  
4) LN has its own possibilities to make onboarding much more efficient.  
blocksize increases are really a last measure.

hindsight is 20/20. trading might even lead to bigger losses than hodling. if you are bullish long term, hodling is safe as fuck and still made people unprecedented gains in the past. 
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:01:42
do you know how LN works in general? assuming yes...
ELI5: with AMP you can now pay bigger amounts on LN because you don't have to pay from one "wallet" (actually channels) but can split your payment and pay from several "wallets" and mitigate "failed routings" due to insufficient capacity in the hops to the receiver of the payment.
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:14:29

with reduced polemic you can say:  
you can buy assets instead of holding fiat. Ofcourse this would pump the asset market. Also means every human on this planet eventually would need to take on market risks or pay interest for not taking any. So essentially it reduces money to merely a medium of exchange. you can make the case for it with the respective ideology.  
Besides putting the cart before the horse by making GDP the primary goal and not human wellbeing, the real problem in my view is that it makes institutions like Banks even more powerful as it makes it even harder to escape them.
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:49:46

@_date: 2019-04-30 16:02:54
halving is not exactly bad. lower inflation means also higher price. as you can see in the past, price rose before the halving because some people are frontrunning the supply cut.
it's kind of a compromise because you have to distribute the coins somehow until all are distributed and you have to incentivize miners for some time until fees are enough to pay their service to the network.
@_date: 2019-04-02 08:17:45

your question is formulated in an unclear way.
the paper says 'without custodial risk'. you can use LN without custodians, but doesn't mean there won't be any.  
the paper says 'no blockchain centralization'. means the blockchain will stay decentralized as compared to with a enormous blocksize which would be required for millions tps. If LN itself has any tendency to centralization is open for debate and empirical data as it grows. up to now it looks like the network stays very well decentralized.

I mean that I slept 8 hours and syncing after that took already minutes. But it's the same with mobile wallets that only sync when opened.  
other question: Is Autopilot still lacking accuracy. I let it create channels, but I couldn't pay to tippin.me on twitter. no path I guess.
feedback: I think the client should better indicate that autopilot is working. I was like 'wtf how do I let it open channels?' at first. Also a max fee should be setable. Autopilot paid like 100sat/b.
@_date: 2019-04-09 06:17:50
it's actually based on a very simple assumption:  
As long as Bitcoin has increasing perception as the future store of value the halvening MUST increase the price.  
there is no way around it as long as the assumption is true. then it's likely speculators frontrun the halvening.

doesn't matter in the long run.

It's a very reasonable approach by german authorities, because they do not try to make Bitcoin a security just to gather taxes. Bitcoin is money and that's how it's treated. That you don't have to pay taxes after one year is just the result of this realistic judgement, not because they want to encourage hodling.

the limits are still a burden. as long as you are hovering inbetween all good, but when your channel is full or when you get below the channel closing threshold it's getting inconvenient.

My point is that miners might be against a blocksize decrease, so they keep mining 1MB blocks and even if their nodes will be the only ones verifying it. Means a UASF only works if at least some miners agree on the changes. So I would assume a softfork wouldn't be effective because miners wouldn't upgrade.

I am puzzled by **third**  
It only makes sense to me that in a equity based economy under a sound money standard if credit business gets superseded by equity business. A nominal credit would be a damocles' sword to a business. On the other hand equity and the payouts to its shareholders are more flexible.  
 
Considering that crypto might revolutionize the way we invest in companies, we might ditch credit instruments and create a world of shareholders. Banks new business model is custody and portfolio management.

You either do fractional reserve and create money out of thin air or you increase velocity on equity. The increase of velocity on equity is miniscule compared to the other part. So when we talk FIAT, for simplification, you can describe it as I did.  
You know, when central banks are buying stocks like in Japan, or buy state bonds like in the US and Europe you know this shit is not going to end well. In Europe the ECB wasn't even allowed to buy bonds (for a reason maybe?), which ofc was done after 2008. They are artificially supporting market prices with air (no value added). If you believe in physics you know this will end bad one way or the other or it will be a ponzi without end.
Pure FIAT does only exist for less than 50y now. This is nothing and no proof at all that this will work indefinitely. Especially when considering that they NEED to abolish paper money in order to enforce negative interest rates on deposits in order to counter act a recession. What a joke. How shall this go on? -20% on deposits in 20 years?

I certainly agree with most of it. But take consumer protection laws. They surely are reasonable in general but take the freedom of companies to do whatever they want.

people earn money because others are willing to go into debt for their service. It doesn't have to be a direct relationship. Your very own company can sell products for equity only, but somewhere in the world someone has to go into debt so you can pay back yours. Otherwise a deflation spiral, which only applies to FIAT, would cause an immense crisis.

this is just joking about the discussion of Bitcoins energy usage. the energy Bitcoin uses is necessary to secure the integrity of the network. It's currently securing $100B worth of bitcoins and will probably be trillions in the future.  
In the long run energy is no problem, as we can produce virtually unlimited amounts with renewable energy technology. It's essentially very clean because it uses the most universal form of energy. If mining would consume oil it would be different.

okay. putting jet propulsions on planes is just duct tape on the issue, that planes are otherwise to slow.  
means at first it has to be shown by any other 1st layer technology that it's even possible to have a secure and immutable decentralized system that can scale to millions of transactions per second wihtout a second layer. Because I tell you no plane can fly 800 km/h without jet propulsion.  
that LN leads to centralization has to be proven as well. decentralized doesn't mean perfectly distributed btw. It just has to be ensured that the system can't be taken over by a minority.

hydro is flexible when using a dam. true.  
other renewables us natural energy flows you can't control.  
well the point is, there is no shortage on electricity and the environmental impact can be kept short. The problem is not Bitcoin mining but the energy production.   
The argument is misleading and potentially a trojan horse for promoting inferior consensus mechanisms.

We all don't know what the tipping point might be, but as you said it might go suddenly. Imagine a severe global financial crisis and people turning to Bitcoin (the anti-thesis to the finance industry monster). This shit goes like boom in a time span of 1-2 years. Banks might be ordered to cut connections to exchanges (for ordinary people) and slow it down. That way the rich will load their bags first to make sure they stay on top.
I can't imagine humankind going forward the next 100y like the last 100y. We need to reorder society to the better by shrinking the financial sector and focusing on the 'real' economy.

the Bitcoin Blockchain as you know it is the 1st layer.  
A 2nd layer is build on top of Bitcoin. For example the Lightning Network, which is live already but still in beta and in need of developement. It's purpose is to make transactions off-chain and therefore very fast and cheap. It's meant for the smaller daily transactions.

why using inferior cryptos if you can use BTC layer 2?  
**How Bitcoin is advertized:**  
- hardest money ever in human history  
- securest blockchain out there  
- completely open source and user/community driven  
- no premine, no developer fee  
- most decentralized network (yaya china fud)  
- second layer will provide for low fees and fast transactions  
**How altcoins are advertized:**  
- low fee  
- fast transactions  
Bitcoin holds $100B dollar on the securest network ever and probably Trillions in the next years. That's what you wanne have as merchant, that's where you wanne hold your cash wealth.  
Altcoins just jump on the alleged weaknesses of Bitcoin because that's their only chance to gain traction and leech money. They mostly neglect the base features of hard money, which most people overlook in their superficiality.

The capital draws money from the wealth creators, the people who actually work at the company. All profit goes to the share holders, otherwise it's not profit. I get my dividends from my shares while I am scratching my tea bag and create no value at all. It's not even risky if you diversify correctly.  
So it is theft if you want it to make it so! Same with taxes, which is the dividends for the state from your earnings/profit.

normal market logic doesn't apply here.  
people may buy more cars if the prices get lower because they get the same value for less money.  
but if you trade 1$ for btc you still have 1$, no matter what the price is. Only speculation will increase the price after a price drop.

So we better stop using cars? Bitcoins energy consumption is necessary for it being secure. If you think Bitcoin and sound global money is useful, you shouldn't consider the energy wasted. we should just transform energy production, which makes sense anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-07 10:02:03
I can't say that. Bitcoin is a global hard money with the prospect to prevent total control in the digital age. money will probably be fully digital at one point and leaving it to central authorities is very dangerous. So I think even if Bitcoin uses a lot of energy compared to for what it's used right now in the daily life of people, it is probably worth it. at least the market says it's worth it.

Banking today is completely inflated. Alone currency trade goes into billions (trillions?) each day. Bitcoin will bring Banks back to the boring business of custodianship and lending (1:1 without fractional reserve). Banks are a necessary evil as anything that doesn't produce value and should be shrinked as much as possible. Instead we have this inflated monster dominating the economy especially in the US and the UK.

@_date: 2018-03-31 12:55:31
the hurdles are mostly technical imho:  
1) we need a almost feeless system working (LN?). 
2) we need merchants to accept btc on a great scale. 
3) we need a use case that's not possible with current means, like money streaming. imagine paying streaming services like Spotify each second when you stream music instead of a flatrate.

Energy is one of the most used attack angles on Bitcoin.  
You should realize though, that electricity is of no concern. It's the only ressource we have virtually unlimited supply of. On top of that Bitcoin mining will always be located in areas with lowest price for electricity, which means it uses excess energy which would've been wasted otherwise.

edit: oops. wasn't supposed to be an answer. whatever... :)
I can think of three accounts that display the resilience and value of decentralized systems.  
1) gold is a form of decentralized money as its quantity and form is governed by the immutable laws of nature. it bested all competitors and could only be pushed aside by centralized powers after it took over almost the whole world and served as global money. it's still very valuable.  
2) the capitalistic market economy is compared to other forms before the most decentralized economic systems in history. nothing created that much wealth and it's still spreading across the globe.  
3) the internet is the most decentralized communication system in history. anyone can set up a website and spread information. in a very short time it took over the world without much resistance and still growing.
decentralized systems that give power to the individuals respectively small groups or prevent central power might tend to win in the long run. Bitcoin will probably win in one way or the other.

changing the network in social media or being on two different ones is essentially free of cost.

In such a scenario you have to remove the profit motive!  
Means robots will provide their service for the cost of their selfpreservation which includes their replacement with a better model. If you think big, the fully automated economy will provide services for fractions of the costs today. Everything would be dirt cheap as there is simply no profit motive.

the reasons why people think it's ponzi is:  
1) they don't understand the mechanics of a new 'commodity money' entering the world stage.  
2) they don't understand Bitcoin.  
as soon as someone understands he'll know why we HODL.

I agree on the reduction of excessive consumerism. On the other hand it will cause a decrease in necessary production and therefore reduce jobs. Therefore we probably have to change the work/income-relation.   
My hope is we will finally realize with how much less work we can operate a wealthy society nowadays. It's contradictory that stress in some branches is even increasing despite an X-fold productity increase since WW2


In fact the economic growth isn't exponentional. Growth rates shrink with maturity of the economy and therefore interest rates drop.  
But we are only talking GDP here. Technological advances aren't directly meassured in GDP. Imagine a Star Trek replicator fueld with cheap solar and wind energy. It costs almost nothing to operate. GDP goes down, wealth goes up. That's why the "GDP economy" must be rethought imho.

yes ofcourse. But is it Bitcoins fault how we produce electricity? Bitcoin doesn't care were the electricity is coming from. So we should rather say we have to transfer to renewable energy.  
Cars are different. They require a specific form of energy (oil). That's why transitioning to electric cars is reasonable. It's the most universal form of energy (electricity) that is virtually unlimited on this planet

that's not how it works. The amount of coins generated is not dependent on the mining power. If all miners would shut down I could mine this shit solo in my 1k€ PC because the difficulty would be adjusted downwards.  
Assuming a stable price, when halving occurs less miners can mine profitable. They stop mining. Hashrate goes down. Difficulty goes down. New equilibrium reached. BUT the price is increasing ever since, therefore hashrate increases nevertheless. Once Bitcoin tops out and becomes stable, hashrate or rather energy consumption will also top out.  
[all-time log chart of hash rate]( 
1st Halving 2012-11-28  
2nd Halving  2016-07-09  
we see price is driving the hashrate. In the last mania 2017 mining was already so specialized and big that the reaction of the mining market wasn't that extreme. Mining investment also lags behind the price development. It is currently flattening because of the bear market. So if price becomes stable at one point, mining will also become stable.  
Besides all of that, we have unlimited supply of green electricity on earth. We just to need to harness it with renewable energy technology that ever getting cheaper from year to year. It even beats conventional energy production by now and we're just starting.

An option on a future without total surveillance and control! 
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:04:36
at first, yes it will slow the economy down but...  
1) People must buy what they need, so there is a base consumption.  Housing, food, water, transportation, energy and a lot of electrical devices.
2) The logic that people won't spend anything on luxury like a nice car is false. If I wait for tomorrow indefinitely I'll never have my desire fullfilled. It would be bad for the GDP economy when people only buy a new smartphone every 3 years instead of every year, but it would be reasonable. Deflation forces a sane decision rather than a insane one. 
3) What do you mean with healthy trade? Even if we do not grow GDP anymore we'll have technology improvements that increase quality of life wthout increasing GDP. I think we have to stop to only evaluating GDP and think about new forms of work/income relations. Today we are totally reliant on GDP growth in this GDP-economy to keep people in, sometimes unnecessary, work. Also for example, GDP grows if a society needs more medication, therefore I think GDP is not a good indicator to rely on alone. It is dominant because it is very important for the capital/work-mechanism.
@_date: 2018-11-07 10:57:47
Do you have detailed data?  
hashrate is exponentially increasing while miners get more energy efficient. the reduction of the mining reward every 4 years is counter acting an infinite growth. that's theory though.

@_date: 2019-01-04 03:01:30


You shorten the effective availble supply. If you decide to hodl you signal desire and support the price. Bitcoin needs a much higher price for it being able to 'mirror' the world economies transactions. That's why price rallies and volatility is a given until Bitcoin has eaten the whole world or it failed.  


If you hold AAPL instead of selling you support the price. Nothing else. People think they invest in a company and support it, which is a fallacy. They already got the money from the emission. You only support a company if you buy the emission of stocks. After that it's just trading, but no new capital raise for the company.

nothing has intrisic value. Gold has no value to a dog, and air which has a lot of value for humans has a price of $0.  
Bitcoin is not widely adopted yet, that's correct. But how long do think did it take for Gold to establish worldwide dominance as a store of value and medium of exchange? We are seeing the history of Gold happening before our own eyes in time lapse! Bitcoin is a new money and an unpresedented event for thousands of years in human history. No wonder it looks like a ponzi scheme on the surface. But if think about how a new free market money could establish itself, it's exactly what we see with Bitcoin. People are slowly coming in and pushing the price up so it can actually function as a global money, because supply is fixed and there is no other way.

if you want things to work you must assume egoism. self-preservation is a basic instinct. Extreme greed is simply an exaggerated sense for self-preservation. It's like the more you have, the higher your status, the less it's likely for you to die.  
Effects for the common good must be seen as emergent from the social system we live in. If you assume altruism as a basic instinct the system is very likely to fail. People will become the more atruistic the more they are safe and free. Safety and freedom surpresses the survival instinct and let's us strife for more.

mass adoption can't happen before the next crash in 3-4 years, before LN is easily usable, before on-chain efficiency isn't improved by a lot and before decent opt-in privacy.  
Maybe we have easy to use and proven LN in 4 years

the scientific method is the most powerful tool mankind invented. even though scientist invest their lifes in careers, still no one respectable will ever claim he is telling you absolute "truth".

your logic is off.  
doubling your efforts means essentially doubling your costs at lower reward.   
if anything low profit margin miners pre-halvening will shutdown their miners in order to mitigate huge losses post-halvening, which keeps it profitable for high profit margin miners pre-halvening.  
now if most miners sell all their coins for fiat in order to realize profit in fiat instead of hodling the profit in BTC, the supply gets reduced. if most miners hodl their profit it has a very minor price effect as supply wouldn't be effected that much.

economically you are redistributing from capital/savings to consumption, which is quite the opposite of Bitcoin's incentive and the proposal of furthering cost reduction. We must save and invest in order to develope and built production facilities that provide the basic needs for much less money.  
on the other hand the UBI will lower the incentive to work for a pityful wage, therefore raise wages and create incentive to automate more low paid jobs. So UBI might have that going for it.  


I'd argue a UBI is much bigger political effort than exploiting market incentives. UBI also reduces government control. It potentially lays off a lot of people who are working in agencies. 


completely agree. there is nothing I wish more for than a drastic reduction of force on humans and the environment. but I'd rather see this come true by technical means in a 'natural' way than by applying force. that's actually one reason why I want Bitcoin to succeed. I want to see of we can, by incentivizing savings instead of brainless consumption, improve production costs much faster.

with everyone participates I mean everyone is winning when we are able to cut costs drastically. Has nothing to do with utopia.
 


I can't think of any. But it would be the most stable society imho. That's what drastic cost reduction would bring us. (for example Jeremy Riskin's "Zero marginal costs" points towards this)






I don't think so, because you have a lot of people against UBI. From their point of view people aren't equal under UBI, because net receivers are favored against net payers. UBI would be a relief for the poor, but an felt attack on especially the middle class and the rich. 






what is true freedom? Not one single person lives in true freedom from a certain perspective. All we can do is reducing the force nature and society is putting on us. UBI is just another force. We need pareto improvements, from which everyone benefits.

sure. I am from Germany and I am glad we have a kind of decent social safety net.
nevertheless imho cutting costs is much better than just giving money away because:  
1) cutting costs is acutally natural anyway in an competitive economy, redistributing money is not. It can be accelerated by certain politics.  
2) everyone participates. You have no situation of net payers and net receivers. no social tension between two groups and therefore no potential for political parties to play this potentially hostile situtation.  
3) people have a sense of sustaining themself, but still have more freedom to do what they like. Again, no one can point fingers on others.

I think crypto COULD be the catalyst for a radically reorganized capitalism from vertical to lateral organization. (time span 20-30 years) depends on your point of view if you'd like to give it a new name or if you'd stay with capitalism.  
it's not anti-capitalist per se. Though it might get rid of some unloved traits capitalism has.

Bitcoin maximalism can also be cringy you know.  
Grin is a MimbleWimble implementation. No pre-mine, anonymous part-time devs depending on donations and testground for speculative tech like a new PoW algo. Reaction from Bitcoin maximalists like Jimmy Song and Tone Vays, even knowing less about the project than me, are like "SCAM!!!" Let's me doubt their intelligence tbh.
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:21:22
yes right, it's also propagation.
so there are two main factors:  
1) price per mb harddisk.  
2) quality of propagation which is dependent on dedistribution of bandwidth ans propagation mechanics.  
nevertheless. a little bigger blocksize should be feasible within the next years.

how does it increase inequality if the people you speak of have no wealth at all at the moment? The biggest redistribution will be from inflated assets to Bitcoin. Those who are invested in inflated assets are those who are wealthy already. The lower and upper middle class who just have self used real estate aren't necessarily victim to this redistibution because they use it anyway and aren't planning to liquidate. So price doesn't necessarily matter that much.  
So in theory the redistribution happens from late adopters to early adopters and not from poor to rich.  
Countries where people are worse off than in the west might adopt earlier and therefore gain wealth.

I had economics in university. please stop condescending.
assuming bitcoin gets wide spread its value will stabalize as the speculativ trade volumes will decrease in comparison to purchase transactions. stable value means let's say a deflation of 2%.
the assumption people won't spend and instead hoard everything above their basic needs is a fallacy because it implies that humans main purpose is to accumulate money. at least I wouldn't give up on my vacations for the sake of accumulating 2% more money. inflation just pushes people to spend more than they actually need. (therefore credit bubbles, pollution and faster ressource depletion.)

people will simply use it if they want to. I will spend my fiat before Bitcoin or gold ofcourse as long as fiat exists. Why? Because it is more valuable to have. Your argument is Keynsianism, which is not a holy grail my friend.  
Deflation is only a chatastrophe in a fiat/debt system, because the real value of debt increases and totally reks the balance sheet of companies. In a money system wich is built on equity this can't happen. Fiat is a debt system that creates bubbles and you pay the price daily. Inflation, high housing prices, market crashes and so forth.

Bitcoin goes through the history of gold in time lapse. It's an unpresedented event in human history and therefore awkward. In order to become global money it must increase in value drastically, otherwise it can't serve the global economy as medium of exchange. That's the game theory behind it to make it a global money in the first place. early adopters get rewarded, which makes it look like a ponzi until you understand that Bitcoin is:
- the hardest money ever (limited supply)  
- decentralized (banks/politics do not control it)  
- immutable (decentralized consensus mechanism) 
- censorship resistant (decentralized transaction verification)   
- pseudonomys / partially anonymous (privacy)  
- eventually fast and cheap (it is already in terms of settlement but we need 2nd layers)

UBI is interesting but as a static tool (flat amount) I see some inherent problems. best would be if basic needs would tend to go down to zero cost somehow.
1) housing  
(no speculation on real estate anymore, new construction techniques)  
2) food
(fully automated vertical farms running on improved renewable energy)  
3) electricity  
(cheaper renewable and decentralized energy network possible)  
4) medical care / insurance  
(I don't know how but I think licensing of medication might be the topic to tackle. it's ridiculous that people can't afford to stay alive)  
5) clothing  
(rather cheap already)  
6) mobility  
(autonomous cars on scale and mobility on demand will make mobility very cheap)
if this was easily payable with any job 20 hours a week the hard to implement UBI wouldn't be needed. when we are heading towards full automation the things above could partially be OS-style community/society efforts.

to be fair: the difficulty adjustment essentially prevents reducing consumption. if miners get more efficient the electricity costs decrease which causes more miners to be installed.  
nevertheless. the incentive to use cheap  renewables and overcapacity reduces the impact drastically.

1) The tax income of the state is laveraged through FED loans. If there were no interests on it the laverage effect could be theoretically infinite. That's the nature of it. What you siad is kind of implying taxes are useless cause they can create the money as they wish anyway.
2) that's the nature of debt induced money systems. When companies take loans the central bank also create the money out of nothing.

uhm. Fixed money supply isn't about price stability. That's the point. It fluctuates in order to direct the market.

appearently it's you who doesn't know how it works.  
the difficulty is dependend on the provided hashrate. more miners = higher difficulty. Blocks are never scarce. The difficulty is set so one block is found approx. every 10 minutes. Forever. If miners become less the difficulty gets lowered (which might attract new miners). 
My point/theory is that once Bitcoin is fully scaled and price will become stable, a reward halving will probably be problematic to some miners, so they have to quit. There will be so much hashpower that losing some miners won't be problematic. The point is, that energy consumption is limited by the price of energy. There is no way the consumption can grow exponentially forever.

You are working with a base assumption, namely that BTC will always rise in value due to it's deflationary structure.  
In that scenario people hold almost all their money in BTC, it would be stupid not to. why would I hold inflationary currencies? I'd like to take a loan in USD yes, but for nothing else.
you are confusing scenarios to strengthen your argument.

it would be better if it wouldn't need energy, no doubt. But nothing of value works without energy.  
china is massively investing in renewable energy as they still grow pretty fast. Europe has around 20% in renewables already, but has the problem that it's energy usage isn't growing and therefore would have to deinvest the existing power plants. The same for the US. Africa might leapfrog to renewables.
renewable energy will completely take over planet. costs are already very low and they are still declining exponentially. and the cherry on top is that energy production can now be partially decentralized. fucking awesome!

Evaluation:  
I can't tell you what bitcoin is actually worth. But in general bitcoins longterm value will be determined by network usage. It's worth arises from the promise of the advantages of a decentralized uncorruptable network. you might hold it as a store of value but only as a derivative of the network value, not as intrinsic value. this is not to be mixed up with speculative market value, what we see right now. a bitcoin thats widely used in the economy would way more stable, as most transactions would have their origin in trade not in speculation.  
what has value?  
my comparison with the flight ticket is not too bad. the ticket gives you right to take a plane somewhere. the paper it self has almost zero intrinsic value. bitcoin is your ticket to use the network, to transfer value. but without the rules of the network your bitcoin is worthless. without the plane your ticket is worthless. Yes you can't trade the ticket once you used it, but can you trade the bitcoin you've spent for a flight ticket? for you it's consumed as well.

I do not bash other projects in general. It's just too extensive to describe every nuance. I do not only hold BTC btw. 
But let's say this:  
- Bitcoin 2nd layers can be automated so that you as a user won't even notice you are using it. The tech allows to just use Gold. In the past humans needed silver and copper (altcoins) for the smaller transactions. This is simply not necessary anymore.   
- Bitcoin RSK side-chain is a Bitcoin smart-contract platfrom with contracts written in solidity just like Ethereum.    
- Bitcoin has many privacy features in developement. Maybe it'll never be like Monero, but Bitcoin will probably be private enough.  
for me there are way more reasons to stay in BTC than to get into other coins.

people in general overestimate the current adoption rate heavily imho. if you are in this sub daily you are in an information bubble/filter which makes it appear way bigger than it is.  
2018 can be decisive if btc even makes it to the mainstream era. if developers manage to make ecommerce heavily adopt btc as direct payment with LN and so forth btc will probably hit critical mass in 2019 and take off for really meaningful adoption rates above 1%. then it could be unstoppable no matter if (slightly) better tech comes around. no one cares for better compression than mp3 for example after it hit critical mass.

1. currently way too few shops and still a huge investment opportunity. why spend if you can potentially do 1000% profit? once it stops being a investment it'll start being a currency. this will happen gradually if successful.
2. requirement for it being a currency is refuting mainstream economical school. listen to them and see if you/we/others/time can tell a different story and refute it. (keywords are deflation/credit supply/volatility)
economy must work with deflation, credit supply (or a new form of pre-finance) must be secured and volatility must go down with increasing rate of adoption.

@_date: 2018-02-16 14:35:15
this is a VERY good question! and I am searching for answers as well...
imho:  
- in a deflationary paradigm we'd have to change our book keeping in companies to relative perspective. means even if you write nominal losses you might actually be in the green zone taking deflation into account. this also allows logically for (variable) negative interest rates above deflation rate calculated by the network.
- as of now loans can't be given as an added money supply which forces us to give loans from limited liquidity. in my mind this might be a huge problem even though the value of BTC would rise with expanding investment opportunities. it definitely constrains felxibility for now.

by buying and selling you can speculate on anthing with monetary value.
Bitcoin's value is not based on fiat. We just denominate its value in fiat. you could as well price Bitcoin in bread and beer. 
Bitcoin main difference in a monetary sense is that it has a supply cap and the issuance until 2140 is only for the miners who protect the network with their hashrate. Inflation for anti-fragility
Fiats issuance is theoretically limitless. It gets issued for credit/liability, means all fiat in ciculation is debt. Bitcoin has no debt attached to it when it comes to its issuance. (ofc you can lend out Bitcoin)
You should invest in Bitcoin if you believe in its longterm future, for example that it will replace gold as a store of value in the digital age.
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:51:15

@_date: 2018-07-13 20:13:55
for every buyer there is a seller. so in the extreme case of bitcoinization (100% bitcoin adoption) dollars won't simply vanish and someone has to hold them. all debt is based on a contract, fiat-denominated. if this currency get worthless because everyone wants to sell it for bitcoin you'll essentially devalue all debt and people would get debt free pretty easy if it's fiat-denominated.  
the new debt will gradually build up in bitcoin respectively in the new crypto credit system, that must be developed before bitcoinization, because at some point no one would like to give loans in fiat anymore as it devalues drastically.  
so there will still be debt. some will be lucky to pay off their fiat debt easily due to devaluation of fiat.

the US should just stop sanctioning countries just for economic reasons. They fucked up Cuba big time, which is a beautiful and peaceful country even though they live under a dictatorship.  after the collaps of the SU Cuba had no one to trade with and US isolated them so hard not giving a fuck about the devastastion they bring to the Cubans.

monetary expansion could happen through prolonged terms of payment throughout the supply chain. So through IOUs the bitcoin supply can be increased to a value above basic expenses of a company. so essentially the most liquid companies will be the P2P banks of tomorrow pushing their sales and in case of investment goods like machines pushing investments in the economy. all without a middleman.

not really because everyone will except LN payments as Bitcoin payments. the 2nd layer FRB system creates coins that didn't exist but they must be transacted on its own network. No one will accept these coins as Bitcoin. If you like you can bend it but LN is defacto no altcoin.

the abstract idea of bitcoin exists for 3 decades already. no AI in sight. and AI today is still very stupid. it's just the types of tasks that computers are better at since the very beginning.    
your theory pretty much impossible to be true. even now, almost 10 years after the first block was mined.
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:59:22
that's a reason to accept it as you might profit from holding.  
also people might spend more wisely but they won't stop spending. People reducing their (over)consumption is economical and not bad.  
the only problem I see is unflexible credit supply. But this might get solved or might be refuted.   
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:57:36
it's pretty new and it works. The network is growing. Nevertheless it's still not even close to perfect and a lot of work lies ahead for the devs.  
In general the bitcoin community has big hopes in LN in solving the scaling issue alongside some other 'problems' like privacy.

even though this model is developed based on Bitcoins past, its claim is not being an extrapolation but an descriptive model for scarce goods (especially with monetary premium). meaning it should describe the behavior of any good with the same property parameters.

yes it (potentially) scales Bitcoin 10x-1000x or more. Even if you refill your channel once a month and make your daily payments, let's say 50 a month, it already scales Bitcoin by 50x. Now you could also receive salary via LN which reduces the necessity of refilling immensly as only the employer does the on-chain transaction for his employees. ...and so forth.  
this being said,  
1)  any improvment in data compression, tx batching or even a blocksize increase has a immense effect on Bitcoin's scale.  
2) Any improvement in LN channel management, which reduces necessary on-chain tx, has an immense effect on scaling (Loop-In,Loop-Out,Splicing, AMP etc.)

Bitcoin's code can be copied and it has been multiple times. But it won't be Bitcoin (BTC).
You can't copy the users, the miners, the network in general. This makes any copy pretty much worthless. There will only ever be 21M Bitcoins, no matter how often the code will be copied.

no one is prohibited to defend himself. maybe you can't imagine it but here in Germany you don't know people who have guns except they are prosecutors, hunters or sports marksmen.

the receiver could see this feature enabled and any merchant could deny such payments.  
paper money is more secure in that regard. It's very hard to give it to the wrong person, especially $400M. And if you do, you have information about the receiver and the money can't leave the country that fast. with bitcoin the money is gone. no chance at all except when the wrong receiver is honest.

capitalism will shrink over time and not necessarily dissappear completely everywhere were things get decentralized, digitalized and abundant.

@_date: 2018-07-01 18:17:59
exactly  
4tx/s is not a magical barrier. Bitcoin already processes 7 tx/s. the bigger the blocks the more people get excluded. it's gradual. and gradually the decentralization is reduced. It's not only keeping up with the chain but also propagation time. Only because we might have &gt;100 mbit/s you can't assume this globally. Also needed disc space increases to amounts that may require adding new HDDs regularly. which is an investment for voluntary nodes. those people will stop verifying at one point if the costs get too high.  
it's worth the research to make data volume smaller instead of blindly increasing block size. I am sure blocksize will keep increasing over time, as last resort.

1. Channel factories will allow to create several channels with one single on-chain transaction  
2. I am 100% sure blocksize will be increased again at one point. The later the better.  
3. data compression in the blocks will also increase tx/s the coming years.  
4. Visa level won't happen instantly. this is miles away and only the parabolic time frame of adoption will be critical. I think this is years away and enough time to set everything up.

behind the counter of a pharmaceutical store, i.e. he knew there were no weapons behind the counter, and stabbing the employee dozens of times.
I simply used the same method as you. 
So what ya wanne do. Everyone should carry when walking the streets? If that was the case the attacker would have simply shot him after getting out of the car. simple as that. that was probably a psychopath with no empathy paired with material desperation. You cannot no prevent that with weapons. You can just prevent it by helping such people to not get that desperate. If it's a psychopath who kills just for the lust, well then you have no chance anyway.

not as far as I know and actually, they would have a hard time to justify a change. It's not like that the government can change tax laws without validation by the fiscal courts and Federal Constitutional Court. Also it'd not be a change to the law but a change of the interpretation. Bitcoin didn't change, so there is no justification to make a 180° turn in that matter. Germany is just a hardliner in regards of requiring a banking licence to operate an Bitcoin ATM.

the fiat debt system doesn't allow it do be paid back because it would destroy the money in circulation.

has no basic clue how this system works really. Such statement disqualifies this person to have further debate.

debt gets transfered to bitcoin (macro view). in the process many (micro view) who hold bitcoin and therefore are not or less affected by the fiat devaluation can pay their debt back with way less effort.  
it's pretty much the same when hyperinflation happens. then you can pay back your house mortgage with a loaf of bread.

@_date: 2019-09-01 14:36:08
they can change their stance, but the taxation of Bitcoin in Germany wasn't decided by the government, it was decided by the administation/courts that Bitcoin is private currency. It doesn't generate capital income, so there is realistically no way to change this interpretation. They would have to make new specific law for Bitcoin, which is unlikely to happen as it contradicts the taxation of other assets. It's not that easy as you might think.

Still the theory behind FIAT it is not a fraud. It makes sure ressource allocation in form of loans is possible anytime for profitable opportunities. A limited money supply does not allow that.

It's unlikely you will have any problems. Bitcoin is considered private money in Germany. "Volksbank" and "Sparkasse" are each regional bank networks. Not cheap but rather classical conservative banks.

might be a problem. especially in a world where excessive investing and consumerism is necessary to keep the economy running in order to keep people in work.    
But I think the system might be following a wrong logic if our goal is a healthy and happy society. we should at least consider that our current paradigm isn't as healthy as we might think.    
**Inflation** incentivizes investments and consumerism. Generalizing, it's better to spend now than later. increases GDP.  
**Deflation** incentivizes savings. Generalizing, it's better to spend later than now. might decrease GDP.  
logic of economics/politics now:  
1. 'everyone' needs a fulltime job to survive   
2.  economy must grow (in GDP!) in order to keep people in work, otherwise unemployment produces poverty. actually unemployment is a necessary evil to have a pool of workers to reallocate fast.    
3.  for the economy to grow (in GDP!) people are required to spend as much as possible (Inflation helps)  
now I think a much saner and efficient logic could be:  
1. the economy produces what people really need when incentivized to save ressources, not to rather waste them. In a sense you get rewarded if you do not take ressources from others if you don't need them as much.  
2. this results in 'necessary work' that has to be done by society instead the other way around that the economy has to produce so much work that society can work fulltime.  
3. GDP growth of the economy is no end in itself anymore. Technological advancements will still grow wealth.  
so this seems unrealistic because this would be a MASSIVE paradigm shift in history of humanity. but I think this might be the way to go in the upcoming fully automated, decentralized and also in many respects decapitalized economy.

I think fractional reserve or a similar systems at least make sense in developing economies with many profitable investment opportunities and therefore higher interest rates. In developed economies the interest rates decline 'naturally' with shrinking high profit investments. make no mistake, there are still very profitable single investments to make, but we are looking at the macro level here. with an interest rate spiraling towards zero, one can at least make the thesis that fractional reserve has no positive effect anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:17:38
we are in very early stage and we gotta see if stability starts to reign sometime. Also I do not think it'll be all bitcoin over the world. It will be a complex interwoven system which opens up space for several currencies with different usecases. As you I don't see right now for example how bitcoin can provide the (maybe) necessary flexibility in providing loans (ressource allocation). But I am optimistic that there will be sidechains or interoperable altcoins that will serve this function. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:24:02
bcash fork isn't the problem. completely by the rules. but the people leading it are deceivers for their personal gain and commit fraud at any chance they get. that's why bitcoin people hate on it. do you see anyone hating on bgold or bprivate?

this makes no sense. opening one channel results in multiple tx. how is that resulting in 'prohibitive' fees? LN will have way more 'hubs' than we have miners and decentralized does not mean equally distributed.

adoptionwise 80's ... ultimate crash wise 95. we'll have a crash that will eliminate &gt;80% of coins.
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:16:33
are you serious? we are talking about one of the most impactful paradigm shifts in history and you think the adoption would have happened in a single year? No. people do not simple shift to something they don't understand. Also the infrastructure has a long way to go. this will take another 5-10 years to even reach a substantial world wide adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:37:56
official intention: he (not a developer!) thinks bitcoin should only scale on-chain with bigger blocks. counter argument of actual developers is that it leads to centralization. therefore bitcoin refused to go his desired route. End of story, roger co-initated a hard fork. now guess where all the good developers work. hint: not for roger.  
imho: roger just wants power and more money.

the door is never closing until full adoption. at any point you'll be better off accepting Bitcoin as money. Bitcoin doesn't exclude people. It embraces all of them.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:27:58
that's true if you do not take your limited lifetime into account.  
compare insurances. Statistically they are only profitable for the insurer. But still it's absolutely worth for low risks with high potential (financially ruining) damage, as your lifetime is limited. If your lifetime wasn't limited you could recover from any damage. 
btw I think the chances are way higher than 1% that bitcoin/crypto will be a huge success.

my cut toenails are also rare, they have no value tho. so it's not rarity, but demand that makes it valuable. the air we breath is inifinite and costs no money, it's still valuable to everyone of us. rarity and demand gives it a price. therefore value and price are two different things.

not correct. right now bcash isn't even faster. also if speed is your desired property RIGHT NOW go for Litecoin or nano. And with some adoption LN will be way faster and cheaper than bcash.

yes it has value because there is demand, it has a price because it is rare. if it's used in commerce doesn't matter. if it was used in commerce both, value and price, would increase.

in case you are not a paid shill, better sell your bcash now or get exit scammed on later. this will end badly for bcash holders.

impactfulness has no unit. so you can only derive it from economic impact (GDP, wealth, trade), political impact and so on.   
It's a difference to establish something new and to replace something that is actually considered by most in the industrialized world as working. we are talking about money, what everyone wants and needs (in context of modern society). dude this is a whole other level of change. this isn't just spending money in super markets. Bitcoin respectively crypto gives rise to a lot of important questions. (credit supply, tax, state budget, economic policy etc.)  
if decentralized crypto is going to be the dominant world payment system you were happy to see one of the greatest revolutions of human history. I am very sure.

@_date: 2018-04-25 21:44:58
it has limited money supply just as bitcoin. means you can't expand volume by credit creation. not sure if this is only a good thing.  
difference to gold is though that the addition of new bitcoin is planned in advance.  
bitcoin is theoretically limited like gold but can be used as money in a convenient way. 'theoretically' because you could change the system simply by consensus.

example: you want to pay a car worth 10000€ with LN. no channel in the LN is funded with that amount so it would be impossible to pay. you have a route with 100€ though. In order to pay you'd have to split the 10000€ into 100x100€.

unsolved problem. I am waiting for a serious discussion since I entered Bitcoin. I really would like to see a solution but until now this is what Fiat is better at. 
Giving loans only from savings (from the past) is a step back in economic evolution. With fiat you simply save by paying back the loan. This makes everything more flexible and dynamic.

tx on exhanges happen when someone cashes out or in, usually not when exchanging on the platform.
before batching e.g. 100 customers that transfered their bitcoin to a wallet resulted in 100:100 (inputs:outputs)  
now with batching this results in 1:100 (inputs:outputs) which reduces tx size.  
somehow that way.

you do not understand shorting.  
you make a contract with someone who agrees upon buying X from you for  $10 in 30 days. If the market price is $1 at that time, you pretty much buy for $1 and sell for $10. 1000% profit.
profit calculation is the same as when going long.

bitcoin doesn't have to be on top. there will be many crypto currencies which act as mean of exchange and there will be others for other applications. atomic swaps will merge the whole ecosystem to a very dynamic system. 
we are entering a world where people can choose their money. if states create their own crypto they can make it legal tender but it won't be used as much if it isn't attractive.  
FIAT isn't inflationary by nature, that's why they reduced interest rates to near zero. they feared a deflation. there are two was to see it. inflation is good to make people spend and boost the economy. deflation is good because it creates an incentive to save ressources and use them later. we live in a paragdigm that needs GDP growth for jobs to be created. and thats the pitfall. we have to be wasteful to survive. that becomes insane once a society has actually reached a very high standard of living. and that we spend money on digital goods (game cosmetics and so forth) underlines that.
And I guess there will be a FIAT coin for credit supply. the value of this coin will be  somehow referenced with bitcoin or another deflationary currency. this will control the emitter of fiat in some way.

all transactions are on the blockchain. if you are de-anonymized your activity is traceable. for example if you give away your public key or if you re-use receiving addresses.  
you can clean your record for example by swapping to monero and go back to BTC on a new untouched  wallet.  
BTC will get more private by default in the future. On the base layer and via LN.

no it's not likely they will. The market tends to choose one money. The most important feature is security of funds. No coin existing today beats Bitcoin in that regard. Fast and cheap tx are secondary to security on the base layer and that's why it's build on second layer. The altcoins try to be fast and cheap on the first layer and that's why they will fail.

that's like saying the internet is not the internet, hard drives are.  
Bitcoin is not a product, it's a network. in crypto you can't switch the network without risk and cost. with every day that passes it gets more unlikely another network can win.  
Bitcoin wasn't the first mover actually. every predecessor just failed. Bitcoin got it right and every network that followed is very likely just a cash grab exploiting Bitcoins success. I give it a &gt;99%  chance that Bitcoin will be the totally dominating crypto in  5-10 years. Nano fails just by that fact that it uses PoS.

The strenght of the political attackers is their ability to create money. If they have to buy Bitcoin first to get mining equipment they will pump the price respectively devalue their FIAT in the process.

I don't think that was the point he made.

Bitcoin's value is determined by two aspects (in the long run).  
1) holders as SoV  
2) transactional use. means the more economical transaction are taking place over the BTC network the higher the price must be in order to represent the value of the transactions given the same velocity.  
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:47:49

@_date: 2019-05-12 01:38:55
1. the whale who pushed Bitcoin above 4.2k can now cash in.  
2. check historical price action and compare. we went up 125% from the low already. there is always a correction of at least 30%. so if we go to 8k (155% gains) we'll still go down to at least 5.6k. no guarantee but very likely.  
so buy now if you can't stand it or just be patient.

I can only speak for Germany. Here it's formulated that you must accept Euros as a business. But it doesn't prohibit other forms of payment. Bitcoin is considered private money.  
I'd assume in most if not all democratic countries it's formulated that way. So they would've to pass a law that exclusively prohibits Bitcoin, which should be difficult without heavy opposition.
Bitcoin surely is liberal. Anything that works liberal should be liberal. I don't think 'liberalize everything' is a solution though.

I can tell you the same argument for socialism. Socialism was never meant to be centralized. Socialism is about decentralized power. Taking central control was just a mean to an end, which was a fallacy. (Nazis weren't socialists btw. Only Americans can believe that)

escrow smart contracts on LN or RSK might be the solution. You can tokenize items (cars, houses etc.) as long as they are identifiable (serial number, RFID etc) and trade them via smart contract.

I can't see the future ofc. But historical data proved to be pretty reliable until now. dumps are usually 30-40% in a bull market, which I think started now 12 months before halvening. as it seems BTC is rallying 12 months before the halveing, then dump. then it's rallying right before the halvening followed by dump. same is happening to LTC. seems to be quite natural.  
parabolic runs aren't sustainable. so we have those spikes like now. we might even hit 6000-7000 or so. who knows. but the dump will come for sure.

Do you think a universal decentralized sound money could be free of cost? Is the energy used really a problem longterm if we harness more and more renewables. It's worth to discuss but it's not an unsolvable issue  


that's a good point. we simply don't know because this is uncharted territory.  


that's nonesense. it has a market price like anything else in your so called 'irl'. It's volitile because it's small and has still to grow so much more before it can become stable.  


electricity costs have absolutely nothing to do with price and stability. it's only supply and demand and the supply is not dependent on electricity costs.  


it was never planned that way because it's nonsense.

there are people comitting suicide. there are people suffering every day who don't think life is good, but just still have hope things will get better one day. assumptions usually can't be applied universally and therefore must be wrong.  
The intrinsic value camp says Bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value because the coin isn't physical. Huge assumption right there. The Bitcoin network and the humans interacting on it are physical. So why can't it have 'intrinsic value'. why must the coin be physical?
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:18:12
do you really gain back control of the network if you change algo? you render the attackers equipment worthless, but after the change it will be much cheaper to attack. The attackers must be potent in the first place and could probably easily build up hashrate on the new algo faster than the honest miners.

the economy obeys the laws of nature as everything has to. means to create wealth you have to put in work. to put in work into something that increases productivity you have to be set for your daily needs for a while, otherwise you'd have to spend time working for your daily needs. only saving will enable you to do that.

tx fees will be a lot higher, if nothing changes. but in 100 years things can be very very different. who knows that.  
I think if we have compounding positive progress money will lose it's function at one point and will merely used in order to protect the economy from spam. the moment we need zero humans to produce the necessities of our daily lifes it will be essentially free to live. you'll only pay for scarce stuff. the free stuff will cost a little for spam protection.  
that would be a positive outlook and Bitcoin will look very differently. we'll have to react to changes and not plan 100years ahead in this case.

LN is a thing because tx count won't stay the same but rise drastically in the future. for global massadoption you need probably &gt;1 million tx/s. you can't do that on-chain.  
Liquid is faster but less secure and surely won't replace the main-chain. how Liquid is fractional reserve is something you gotta explain me. It's a fixed peg to BTC.

you are in a logical fallacy. I know that we need higher fees to pay miners after 2140 when block rewards are zero, but there is no guarantee that the fees will be high enough to sustain a high hashrate. there is no game theory or dependency between thos two.

imho:  
it's not a single S-curve. It's two S-curves folded into each other  
1) SoV S-curve  
2) MoE S-curve  
SoV and MoE have two seperate adoption rates and most importantly two different network-effect-multipliers. SoV network effect is weaker than MoE's which is much stronger. The network is much more valueable for MoE compared to SoV!
SoV (hodl) is the dominant right now and flatens towards the gold market cap. But MoE will kick in at some point and accelerate the curve again.  
If MoE-phase will happen is another story, but if it does shit will explode so massively you'll not know wtf is going on.

extreme libertarians must forget their dreams of 'no regulations' and 100% privatization. in the real world there are constellations that do not allow free markets to work properly.  
1) externalities: damage that is done to the environment without the perpetrator being accountable for it. &gt;&gt; regulations
2) natural monopolies: applies especially to infrastructure. you only need one roade in front of your house. competition can't work here. &gt;&gt; public property

what does 'half-assed' mean? doesn't explain anything.  
LN is not main-chain ofc. but using LN means you can leave the main-chain intact and don't sacrifice security and decentralization. LN is obviously for small transactions. As it's seperated from the main-chain the 'IOU' character and reduced security pays for the immense scalability. you'll never be forced to hold any BTC on LN. on other coins that try to scale on the main-network you have no choice at all.  
imho this approach is very reasonable.

nominal price changes in inflation. real price stays the same. same must be true with Bitcoin deflation. nominal price (sats) of fees goes down and real price stays the same (pp of sats).

you assume timing is a strategy for hodlers. Hodlers do not try to time the market. They just buy and let time do its work. In hindsight you can make a fortune in any market in a very short time.  
for me I love the idea of Bitcoin, so I hodl no matter what. I think crypto is the only way to minimize the damage purely digital fiat currency will do to our privacy. Bitcoin is not only a sound money regime, it is also protecting from arbitrary autocraties. I'd be lying if I'd say do not care for the money. Ofc I am also hoping for some profit by supporting this alternative money regime.

BCH is currently probably overvalued. the network usage is very low. active addresses are fewer than on LTC and DOGE. This wasn't that bad if it was the most reliable SoV. But as BTC is security king why hold your funds in BCH? All it does well is providing volatility.

Germany already got rid of its nuclear power plants on paper and has no oil power plants to my knowledge. Ofc they keep'em running for quite some years in order to have a timeframe to shift. roughly 25% of the energy production is from renewables already.  
electricity is no REAL issue for sure if you take any future progress into account. It's already possible to store hydrogen at high temperature by adding an additive, which reduces transport and storing cost. Hydrogen might be the new 'battery'.

logical fallacy bro. If you invest in a company you hold a share you can sell again. So ROI must be just &gt;0%. ROIs on Investments on the business level must be at least the deflation rate, true. But they are usually much(!) higher. Today with with interest rates just above 2% on machine investments you incentivize the accumulation of debt on borderline investments, which leads to a lot of malinvestments as soon the bubble pops. 
A deflationary paradigm will reduce the investments, but the investment quality will increase! huge recessions and bubbles might disappear almost completely.
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:43:13
ok so we lived in a permanent depression until full fledged fiat was introduced? it's peculiar that the middle class eroded since the day we decoupled from gold completely and gave the 'elites' the power to be the profiteers of money creation.
you can't trick physics! with fiat you just grab ressources from the future and use them now without putting work into it. you have to pay back at one point (which is the reason fiat does not collapse instantly), and if you can't you created a bubble because money was used with no work backing it up.  
there is no free lunch for the economy as a whole and sound money embraces this reality.

in theory the price floor of gold created by industrial use makes it worse money. the price discovery is distorted by that. Theoretically in Bitcoin you have the price discovery solely based on monetary use, which is a better representation to steer the economic activities by the market.  
price floor by industrial use just makes gold theoretically more secure as an holding at this stage.

you are correct. taking central power was always a mean to an end to communist which obviously produced corruption,  desaster and millions of dead people. horrible failure. but if you explore the vision of early communists you'll realize the abstract goal was freedom to all people. end the fight for necessities and make people bloom with their passion.
you can't discuss this with most americans though. the cold war produced a blind spot.  
and I am with ya. I try to get a picture of a new social construct through decentralization which might lead to 'communistic' results without the overtake of central power and the application of violence. it's interesting.

SoV = store of value  
MoE = medium of exchange  
UoA = unit of account. 
I assume before Bitcoin becomes a widespread MoE it has to be viewed as SoV by most people. Once Bitcoin enters the MoE phase things will explode as it shifts to a higher network effect multiplier. So the overall success is dependent on making people understand that Bitcoin is precious digital gold.

Kraken, Gemini, Coinbase  
you need an account and to verify your identity (KYC/AML). then make a wire and you are good to go.  
note: not your private keys, not your coins. buy a Trezor/Ledger (cold wallet) and transfer your Bitcoin immediately from the exchange to your cold wallet. Exchanges get hacked for hundreds of millions regularly. Don't be reckless.
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:33:14
I can't be 100% sure but there are quite some reasons Bitcoin won't be replaced:  
- it's the most trusted and securest crypto.  
- it has arguably the best developers.  
- it has a massive headstart and the strongest developed network effect.  
- it's truely open source (no dev fee)
- by far the best 'brand recognition' despite zero marketing budget
- it's good enough and gets better every day  
- it had a fair start (no ICO, no pre-mine).  
- the history of Bitcoin can't be replicated  
- no central figure   
to name some arguments of the top of my head.

lightning is a 0 to 1 event on top of a 0 to 1 event. it lacks features and will take time. It's growing so we can be bullish on it as a growing network draws devs to make it grow even more.

if I could pay for a small house in 5-10 years as a middle-class employee I think we would have more not less. it's no doubt to me that FIAT drives up asset prices.  
I don't think goods like cars would be cheaper. it's a consumption good and you can get a new car for 10k today, which is quite affordable.
@_date: 2019-05-01 09:41:55
it's adding value by being a 'p2p' network removing the central middleman. with network growth the value of one BTC goes up as the network get's more useful the more people are on board.  
compare it with the internet. it also got more and more valuable the more activity it optained. but you couldn't buy a share of the internet itself back then. With Bitcoin as the internet of money it's different.  
In order to account for rising economic activity on Bitcoin the price must go up as it must mirror the value held and transfered within the system.  
You can't compare it to stocks. It's new asset class and that's why many people have difficulties understanding the rise in value.

Bitcoin can only die due to a critical failure or if the game theory stops working at some point. In the end we'll have decentralized money nonetheless.

@_date: 2018-12-11 02:08:42
imho faulty assumptions and the development the past 10 years proves it.  
it gains value exponentionally as a speculative vehicle. this speculation drives liquidity and price up. with rising value volatility will get lower and we will gradually enter the MoE phase, which will  increase the network effect and push Bitcoin to its final victory.  
10y proved you don't need mass adoption (as MoE) to increase general adoption. we wouldn't be here if that were true.  
nevertheless I see that I could be wrong if something huge happens that eliminates Bitcoin.

learn that speed and fees is secondary  and does not pull a crypto years ahead of Bitcoin.
