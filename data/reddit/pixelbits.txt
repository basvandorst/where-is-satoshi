You definitely need to have more information describing what your site is. All there is right now is the logo, a header, and then the item (and the item description). But there is nothing explaining how the site works, which is extremely important.

@_date: 2012-10-19 07:20:48
Here's a template:
**To**: award-nominations
**Subject**: Bitcoin - P2P Currency
**Body**: Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is also the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
Bitcoin allows for anyone to manage their own money with total control. The currency is revolutionizing how people make payments all around the world. Bitcoin is backed by strong cryptography and is nearly impossible to counterfeit. Its benefits to society are plentiful: funds cannot be frozen, it allows for anyone to conduct transactions in a matter of minutes, and identities do not have to be associated with it. It is the currency for the people, by the people.

There are absolutely no fees to list on Bitmit.
@_date: 2012-11-04 03:20:03
Yes. There are many ways to go about this.
If you are a business or freelancer, you can accept bitcoins as payment for your services. You can use [Bitpay]( for this.
Alternatively, you can sell items for bitcoins on marketplaces like [Bitmit.net]( [ and the [Marketplace board]( on Bitcointalk.org.
There is also [Bitcoin mining]( which is basically a way to generate bitcoins while simultaneously lending computing power to the Bitcoin network. This is definitely the most complicated way to "earn" bitcoins though, as it takes decent hardware knowledge, a lot of time, money, and energy to do.
@_date: 2012-12-14 09:09:59
These suggestions are neither marketable or in the slightest bit accurate. Bitcoins aren't stored on 'accounts', but rather on the blockchain, connected to a specific address. A wallet is simply a place where money is held - the term works fine in this case.
Miners are powerful computers that generate Bitcoins and help secure the P2P network. The term "Bitcoin Server" is nonsensical; miners do not act as servers.
And naming a Public Key an 'Acount Address' is just plain wrong. Again, Bitcoins aren't even stored on accounts, and the term could easily be confused with the standard use of the term 'address' in Bitcoin context.

You did bring up a valid point that the physical coins could have zero value if bought from a reseller. Unless it is a highly trusted and rated seller in the Bitcoin community (on the [forums]( [ OTC]( [Bitmit.net]( I would advise only buying physical bitcoins from [Casascius]( itself, or an authorized reseller such as [Memory Dealers]( Although I believe they are now sold out, MD was once selling the physical coins for USD using Paypal/Credit Card.

I've bought and sold a fair amount of items on Bitmit and have only encountered a non-paying customer once. 
Some tips:
- Never buy from someone who doesn't have any seller feedback.
- Only buy when there is escrow offered.
- If the item is too good to be true, it probably is.
- If the seller is offering an account or other digital item, always ask for picture proof of ownership.

Well for one, Bitcoin can be completely anonymous with the use of mixers, proxies, and other methods, so illicit funds can be hard to track down.

Well, a private wallet address is not a thing.
You have a public address (a public key), which is completely safe to share with others.
And you have a private key, which you should by no means share with anyone else. You need to use caution whenever dealing with your addresses' private keys, including creating a QR code for it. Any direct contact with your private keys should be done completely offline and with a Live Boot CD or separate, dedicated device used only for managing your bitcoins.
If you meant your *public* wallet address, you can add your address to the end of  to find the QR code.

I wouldn't recommend buying a Raspberry Pi just to explore GNU/Linux. Most distros are open source and free, meaning you can download an ISO, put it on a flash drive, and boot up into a Linux environment right on your own computer.
A decent raspberry pi setup isn't just $35 - you'd most likely have to purchase peripherals too, which can add up rather quickly.

Definitely can be frustrating, but look on the bright side. You can still sell a coin and net about $500 at the current price on Coinbase ($675-ish). Considering Bitcoin jumped from the 500s to the 800s today, and is quickly back on track, I wouldn't sweat it.

This. I have a paper wallet locked away in a safety deposit box that I don't plan on touching for at least 5 years. As a teen, I don't trust myself with them just sitting around as a hot wallet for easy spending - I want to hold on to them for the long run.

| My thought is that Bitcoin is decentralized with no middlemen.
You are correct. Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that does not have a central issuing authority such as a bank. Bitpay is simply a service that allows ecommerce businesses to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment online, similar to Paypal's merchant platform.

I ordered from them awhile back. I hadn't received my card after a month of ordering it, so I shot Brad at  an email. Turns out there was a problem processing the order, so it never got sent out.
That being said, he sent mine out immediately and it arrived two days later. He refunded my purchase entirely. Having to wait a month for a free Bitcoin address card wasn't too shabby IMO.

Companies that deal with bitcoin should have checks and balances in place to ensure that no one employee or even founder could gain access to company wallets. See Coinbase's approach to security for a pretty good example of this:

Bitcoin was not ruled illegal. The Bank of Thailand has no legal power. A few senior members of the bank saying something is illegal does not make it illegal. The Foreign Exchange Administration and Policy Department are merely departments of the bank, not branches of the legislative government.
In other words the title "Bitcoin ruled illegal in Thailand" should be changed to "Bank of Thailand wishes Bitcoin to be illegal", or "Trading suspended due to Bank of Thailand advisement" which is the original title.

This makes sense on a grand scale. When a large amount of people abandon their accounts, Paypal can no longer make money by charging transaction fees to the accounts. With no money coming from these dormant accounts, Paypal stills has to pay for server space to support them.

Non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are often referred to as "altcoins" - alternate coins. Many are based off of the open source Bitcoin protocol. Others are implemented much differently than Bitcoin, but may have a similar approach in some aspects.
Most new cryptocurrencies are simply forks of Bitcoin with small changes like hashing algorithms, the limit on the number of coins that can mined, faster transaction confirmation speeds, etc.
Check out this handy [list of alternative cryptocurrencies]( on the Bitcoin Wiki to see what's out there. I also recommend reading this article about [Cryptocurrency]( on Wikipedia.

There are 3 main groups of people to make a Bitcoin spot for.
1. The consumer: would use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services, and to send money to peers.
2. The small business owner: would use Bitcoin to take payments from customers / clients.
3. The day-trader: would use Bitcoin as an investment vehicle.
Once you narrow down who you want to target, you have to focus on the benefits of using Bitcoin that would apply to the group:
1. No one can freeze your account. Your money is *your* money.
2. Minimal fees. Non-reversible payments can reduce seller risk and fraud.
3. Extend your portfolio! Bitcoin is a great investment, etc.
I would shy away from number 3 altogether, though. In my opinion, that group is not the type that the Bitcoin community needs.
Other considerations are of course animation vs. live action, and whether to do a TV spot or online ad.

Sure, Android is disruptive, but it's not nearly as radical as Bitcoin. Learning a new UI to understand how to use a smartphone OS isn't even comparable to learning about concepts, like public-key cryptography, the blockchain, and mining, to truly grasp Bitcoin. It's a whole other level.
