My mom kept side eyeing me because I bought in two days ago and it's been dropping since. She doesn't understand why I'm not uncontrollably upset. I bought in to hodl not day trade.

I only serously got into the trading side about a week ago. I'm still learning myself. Sorry I can't be more help.

I recommend just using GDAX. It's  the exchange owned and used by coinbase and there's no fees. You can choose what price to buy at instead of paying the market rate plus 4%.

That's not what they're doing. They're mining alt coins to trade for $12 worth of btc per day

It took about an hr for me a few days ago when it had the ID verification issues message up. I scanned my liscense instead of using a webcam though.

There's no proof anything is going down but if it does, it's a good time to buy. That's all.

imo the biggest risk is if the exchange you're on has an employee go rogue. Having a paper while it is a good idea if you're planning to hold for a while. Just make sure you keep backups of it and try a test transaction to make sure you understand how it all works before you put all your coin on it.

Take this as your first painful lesson in day trading. It happens. It might go back down but it might not. Only you can decide you if you want to buy back now or wait to see.

It's literally the first thing mentioned in the title. Great detective work there.

I understand why mathematically you get more money by paying the mortgage instead of wiping it out. It's not all about the money for most people though. It's hard to put a monetary value on things like stress and worry, especially since everyone feels these emotions in different ways and magnitudes, but those are real cost you're paying too and they're often over looked when giving financial advice to other people. That's all I'm trying to say.

Your question was answered but most of the terms are a simple Google away. "term bitcoin" or "term finance" will bring up a quick definition and some deeper explanations. Don't stay confused. :)

Good credit, a good downpayment, and a little shopping offers does the trick.

The implication that he made it with just that million. The inheritance, both name and money, did a lot more to help than the $million loan.

There's more money in programming than what you're making if you what you describe is accurate.

To back this up, the wall was initially at 960 and all moved to 250. I was watching the charts as it happened. It may have been a coordinated group but there's no way it was just a coincidence.

SegWit does nothing to increase CoinBase's performance. It increases the blockchain's performance.

Walls are just a lot of orders placed at a similar price point. They generally drive the market in the opposite direction until they're broken through. Once they're broken through you'll see the price jump up again. None of this is 100% going to happen but just my general observations confirmed by what I've seen others post around the subreddit.
Most walls don't have a noticable effect because they're lumps of 50-200 btc but the string of 1k+ walls we've been getting definitely have some impact on people's buying/selling decisions.

The change after getting caught has been brought up but sub count is a really dumb metric to use for a sub whose purpose is just a misspelling redirect.

If anyone ask just tell them you were in it to use as a currency. You currently hold almost nothing because you use it to actually buy things. Since you've been preaching so long it should be pretty believable.

Anyone that tells you they do is lying. You just slowly get a feel for what the market is gonna do by participating but you're still only ever making a guess.

Paying off your house is definitely a good idea. Investors seem to severely undervalue peace of mind.

10% of it eaten away before the price moved away from the wall. Not bad.
