Where do you live? Be specific ;-)

Every exchange that accepts bank transfer accepts credit card trades as well. I don't know why people act so weird on this. Name 1 exchange that does not accept VISA and MasterCard?

What do you mean? SEPA transactions take 3 business days. I would like to instantly trade BTC, and that can only be done via Credit and the only Credit Card I own is Corporate American Express. No, I am not a cheap ass or someone with money issues.

You know most people trade using Credit Card right? I know it sounds stupid, I agree it's not the way to go. I am just pointing out that most individuals use credit transactions to get their BTC. I've never done so, and I guess I'll stick to the SEPA transfer, but it takes days to have the money available.
Short answer: SEPA takes days to arrive at the destination (exchange).

Yes, but that's the case with all FIAT. Unfortunately, the only way to get Bitcoin right now is by buying it with FIAT, since there are no jobs yet paying in BTC as far as I know.

I understand. However, most exchanges do accept Credit Cards, most often supporting all VISA and MasterCard  branded Credit Cards, but not AMEX. Coinbase as biggest FIAT exchange is an example.
