Indeed! As long as the base layer (blockchain) stays decentralized we should be golden! :) 
LN will still be trustless and has to adhere to the base layer's rules. I'm  excited! Improving technology is the best way to move forwards. 
So many things are in the works now and IMO optimizing the blockspace is the best way to really scale. Raising the blocksize(weight) scales only linearly (Well technically it can scale a tad more with segwit but that's beside the point) Optimizing will/should provide better scaling in the future!

Yes quite like that. You make a channel with someone (Creating a transaction on the blockchain) and after that the amount can be transferred between both parties (In theory you could use those locked funds to pay someone else. EG. not the one you made the LN channel with) without fees. It requires "huge" amount of LN channels to be open. Some fear it will become centralized (Exchanges and the like have the most LN connections and they become hubs)

I applaud the developers! They are quite mature. They have actual discussions on github&amp;like. And develop code that is probably changing the world :)

Layer 2 is supposed to be under layer 1 (the blockchain which is trustless) You make a payment on the blockchain locking some of your bitcoins. (You create a channel with someone else. Eg a supermarket or cafe or your liquor store) 
Now you can start using layer 2 payments which are offchain but still were validated in the blockchain. 
Search lightning network and atomic swaps for more details.

Oh wait but there is! [freedomnode cold wallet with electrum](
I suggest doing the electrum install offline/use tails for that extra tinfoil. (You've gotta google installing electrum offline, it's simple if you are familar with linux)

LN is supposed to be connected together with other LN channels. Eg you make a LN channel with your friend(s). If everyone were to make these channels you could (in theory) use your LN channel to make payments everywhere with it. 
The best use case of LN in my opinion will be: constant payments (groceries, barber, Fiat-btc purchases etc) and micro-transactions. (Coffee, alcohol etc.)

And a reminder: you may want to move your coins off exchange into a wallet you control. (Your keys - your coins) With an 3rd party you only have an agreement that "you" own the coins.

Segwit is in the commandline version of bitcoin core. And you can generate segwit addresses from the console in the GUI version.
Segwit has been worked for 2 years... and has been active for ~3 months.
It's open source... If you want segwit go help them implement it! :) (Or use tools available right now. I know I have)
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:34:34


This is the most rational thing I've seen in years on the internet! Bravo I can't upcoin this enough.
Bring able to look things from different perspectives shows real wisdom. Which some unfortunately lack :( (See controversial topics eg. Blocksize debate, Drugs, etc)
Also segwit tx's have lower fees because they are weighted differently than normal tx's.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:40:34


I'm sure you didn't mean all the core developers as there are over 200 contributors to the open-source project. But some are employed by blockstream.


Improvements(proposed) to the bitcoin core software are done via Bip's not agreements.

You could doublespend it ��
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:57:32
"Core" is the reference client. The devs behind segwit proposed it years ago but only now it has been "approved" and activated on the blockchain via soft fork. (Approved as in finally major players played along...)
It took long because proper software takes proper testing. Also only a few devs are paid for their time. You can also contribute as it is open source.

With SPV you are trusting someone else to validate the blockchain. If that is not an attack vector I don't know what is...
Please do explain to me how SPV counts.
This reminds me of the ridiculous post by some CEO before segwit2x in which he claimed SPV-clients are the same as full valitading nodes... Such a shame 
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:33:30
It's being built on top of segwit (yes you can use existing segwit addresses. Not sure about legcacy addresses tho)

If you want to learn more I would suggest to read andrea's mastering bitcoin book. Its on github and you can also google it :)

Your keys your coins. Pretty simple. Trusting someone in a trustless environment... not a bright idea :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:08:58
Indeed. Yet few have managed to integrate segwit into their system... I wonder what gives ��
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:33:58
I found an easy guide to do it!  
You need to understand that importing private keys to a wallet (electrun seed/wallet.dat) does not actually make it into the wallet :) ) follow the guide to sent the coins to your wallet of choice. (You can do the same in bitcoin core with coin control I think... probs will try the same personally!)

Always remember backups! Those different wallets stack up :)
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:26:16
Yes somewhat like that. Segwit itself was implemented as a soft fork and older software can't validate the witness data (older than 0.13 iirc)
Why would you stay on older software? "They" will give you time to upgrade :)

Welcome! 
I suggest you research the technology behind bitcoin by reading the whitepaper and watching some youtube videos. A great guy has been introduced already :)
After you think you understand the basics try out a bitcoin wallet. 
Bitcoin core is the "reference" implementation for pc. (Will take time to be usable - see research why)
Electrum (pc and mobile) usable after wallet creation. (Write down the mnemonic keys!) 
When you are comfortable sign-up to an exchange of your choosing and buy some bitcoins. Then you can transfer your bitcoins into your wallet!
Feel free to tip me afterwards to test out bitcoin :) (Remember to set low fee!)

Wise words :) Efficiency! The sync times have lowered because of optimization. Which is what good software should strive towards.
Also shame about your internet :( I/we pay ~28usd/month for unlimited 100/100 MB/s connection. And the last time I checked my data usage was around ~1TB/month :D (That's only for my main pc! I have another one for 24/7 staking/running a bitcoin node.)

Welcome! And remember bitcoin is about not trusting anyone with your money. Leaving your bitcoin to an exchange equals (somewhat) to having your money in a bank. If the bank/exchange goes down you lose your money/bitcoins. Your keys = your coins :)
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:19:21
Third point for EFF! Good for you that the repair wallet worked! :) Btw I suggest you get another wallet software as the multibitHD is no longer supported :) Electrum is a really good wallet IMO.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:26:12
Hey! MultibitHD is no longer supported! Your transaction has many confirmations and the bitcoins reside in the wallet with address 1PdVAD54qB354ppmxm8yGD5y89dKMFpJpS 
Have you tried sending the bitcoins to another address you own? For this you need to create a new wallet. I suggest using electrum. (you can do it with "manage wallet" -&gt; "empty wallet") 
If that won't work you need to move your wallet to another software or import your private key from your 1PdVAD54qB354ppmxm8yGD5y89dKMFpJpS address to another wallet like electrum/bitcoin core.
You will need your 12-word seed key to do this (I hope you have it saved somewhere safe and you can access it!)
Here are two guides to either migrate your wallet to another software (Electrum)
You can also try to import your 12-word seed key into breadwallet.
Or import your private key into electrum:
Remember to disconnect your internet when you are dealing with your seed keys! (
Feel free to ask for help if you can't solve the problem :)

My linux node running the cmd client does not print out rpc calls. (To the terminal) Hopefully reboot fixes it. :) Other than that it's working as expected (Both qt on windows and bitcoind on linux. Which I compiled myself!) 
Great work on synch times, synching the whole blockchain overnight is a massive feat!
Keep up the great work! There are still users that value technological merit more than politics/propaganda :)

Just came here to say this: Great posts! Your writings are a thrill to read :) 
What are your thoughts on UBI? (Universal basic income) Will it be on blockchain technology? It seems possible, given some governments rising interest on blockchains.
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:28:37


Would the fees be lower? I doubt. The chain would be congested (Like it is now) and fees would be crazy. (Like they are now) When would the chain be usable with low fees so that every tx fits in a block...? Would everyone be able to run a node?
Just thinking out loud :)
