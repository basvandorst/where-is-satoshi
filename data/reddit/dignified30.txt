Until his coins move one day, or not.
Until block 0 is signed, or not.
Believe me he can and still does affect Bitcoin markets.

This is the truth though, the fact that Bitcoin works is a feature, i understand most people trade bitcoins for profit obviously but Bitcoins main feature will always be unattractive to the powers that be, it can only ever grow organically because of its features. 
Lets not forget Bitcoin will contiue to work as intended regardless of what men/women in suits will dictate.
Feature, not bug.

Who's got their finger on the trigger for that bear trap??

Just think of a nonce as a number used once, all miners are trying to solve these hashes at the same time making 2.4 yottabytes of hashes per second at todays current network power and it has been increasing since 2009 and today that equates to 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 hashes per second I honestly can't even say that number but is actually in binary conversion 2 to the 80 power so just imagine how hard the "difficulty " is.

Came here to say this

My whole point is how is btc performing so well and precious metals are dropping like a Malaysia flight, if in fact bitcoin does follow other safe haven assets, is this just speculation? I mean "people buying" doesn't mean it's not speculation....

You're good, no trouble at all throughout Europe, even in Moscow, or returning to US
@_date: 2016-12-06 16:00:35
Be your own bank, it's kinda the whole point of Bitcoin, whoosh.

What if I didn't keep all my TX history or price purchased? Also how do I go about explaining coins I have burned on accident?
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:14:21
I'd like to know this too, I burned a couple coins by accident, like wtf
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:44:45
