Nice. We need more people like you. But why on earth  would you paste a pic of your wife on reddit. To many weirdos here )))

First comment on Reddit and I have been avidly reading for the last 6 months. I couldn’t resist at expressing my amazement at your generosity. You set a fantastic example. 
This is incredible.

It is untraceable. I guess it can be somewhat but I can’t imagine many people would be capable of remaining totally anonymous.

Good job guys. You deserve it.

I didn’t know he was a stand up comic. Absolutely love this guy. Highly recommend his books as well. He is one of the few people I’d love to meet in person.

I love how easy it is too verify bitcoin as real. Don’t get me wrong I also like gold but how do I know it is what I am told. ie quality, purity, real or even a lead bar covered in a thin layer of gold. 
One thing against BTC compared to gold is in the event of a massive global shit storm where we can’t use computers, get electricity, prepper kind of event is rather have some gold to trade than some bitcoin.
Could literally write a book on this subject. I’m just not sure how willing people will be to understand this. It’s not until you realise the beauty of bitcoin by understanding the tech behind it that you can comprehend why bitcoin possesses all the qualities we discuss.  
I’m reasonably technically minded and had an urge to understand how bitcoin works. Until I understood the tech I just couldn’t get it. It took me a good month to get it.

I see what you did there. Brilliant. Hahahahaha

Finding this thread interesting. Does this situation mean that someone could have paid for an item (a haircut) and consumed it. The hairdresser thinks they have been paid and then the chain is wound back so that transaction no longer is stored in a block. Have I understood this or is my understanding wrong?

I get what the node does but what is in it for me. Is it just being part of the network. Therefore is I own bitcoin i will indirectly benefit as the more nodes the better?
@_date: 2018-12-23 18:47:38
That would be interesting
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:41:18
Good shout!!!

Thanks what I thought. You summarised it very clearly. Thanks again.

I just said a similar thing on the post. I find when people say it is created by the CIA or something like that. They are thinking that the CIA infiltrated a libertarian email group, bought the pizza, created pirate Roberts website. Just not possible from my eyes. Those that are negative like this guy generally don’t get how it was created and took off.

I’ve got a pi. Wonder what it would cost to run a full node per year.

I always wonder if those that diss bitcoin understand how it works. The second you understand the beauty of the tech it is such an eye opening moment. It’s just hard to see the benefits at this stage without also understanding how it works. On the flip side the more you know the more problems you see.
