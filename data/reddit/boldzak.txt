Was it simple to use? Does it print out a QR code for you or does it scan your wallet’s QR and send the BTC there? Never used one of these before but I do have one nearby so might give it a try

Yes, bank to Revolut, Revolution to Coinbase. Usually takes around 2 hours in total for me.

You should be ok using Santander to fund a Revolut card, then paying Coinbase with that
edit: thanks for the silver anonymous friend! It’s my first
