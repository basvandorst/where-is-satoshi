Down, because the US economy is so large it would hurt the world economy. Bitcoin only becomes more valuable than your nation's currency if it's your nation's currency alone that crashes, because other economies prop up the purchasing power of Bitcoin. If the whole world economy comes down, people everywhere have to liquidate their bitcoin in order to pay for necessities, because they will have lost their jobs, etc.

Bitcoin is not anonymous, especially when purchased through a US exchange. Coinbase obviously tracks your purchases, they give you the transaction history right on the dashboard. They're probably ordered by government to check it against a list of addresses associated with illegal activity, regardless of whether or not it's true, hence the need for bitcoin in the first place. 
In the future it will probably be possible to anonymize the coins you purchase from an exchange when you send them to your private wallet, actually you could do that now by converting to a crypto that guarantees privacy, but unless you do that you have to assume anything you purchase with fiat with traceable(plastic) money is completely traceable even on the bitcoin network. If you want private money I'd probably buy something like Monero and keep it in a wallet that never stores traceable coins, but I haven't looked into it enough to give a recommendation.

I am thinking of doing this, so I don't have to bother with waiting for transfers to an exchange, how fast do you get the BTC though? Is it worth it over just doing ACH with GDAX after I get my paycheck? I'd pay no fees that way, plus could time it with dips in the market.

How can they tax it if it never became USD? No specific USD value can be assigned to it unless you're exchanging it for USD. At best you could give an approximate value of it according to a certain exchange on that day, or according to the USD value of the item you bought. That doesn't really make sense, because those values are approximate and negotiable.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:23:05
People support segwit and not bigger blocks right now because it increases capacity without requiring a hard fork. Larger blocks will be required at some point in the future though unless the majority of transactions move to a second layer and free up processing for the blockchain. Avoiding a hard fork is massively advantageous.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:40:49
There's no tax advantage to going through bitwage. It just saves you the trouble of making a deposit to an exchange and buying, at the cost of 1% of the amount you send to bitwage and not being able to time your buy.

Idk I'm not a wizard. I'd expect one final bubble up to like 50-100k during that peak adoption before it comes in and settles around a stable price that changes slowly against the condition of the global economy.
The price can't get too high that satoshis become significant in terms of purchasing power, because fees would be insane unless they're scaled to nearly 0, I feel like a penny/sat is probably the maximum, or a price of $1mil
If you follow Andreas Antonopoulos's view, fiat currency would be replaced entirely by a digital currency, actually millions of digital currencies, and bitcoin will be the world reserve currency, in which case the price in terms of USD wouldn't exist anymore, but holding a large amount of bitcoin until then would mean you were incredibly wealthy.

So if you buy say 0.001 bitcoin  and 0.0002 bitcoin  
Down the road you spend 0.0001 bitcoin  you get to choose to pay the gains against the bitcoin you bought  right? And if you spend 0.0003 bitcoin  you pay taxes against the gain on the 0.0002 and then 0.0001

They wanted to make a change to the code(larger blocks so that more transactions could be processed in each block that is created every 10 minutes) that required a new blockchain to be formed. Now they are off playing in la la land and preaching to everyone that they are the real bitcoin like some kind of weird cult. 
It's true that Bitcoin has worse performance, mostly in terms of higher transaction fees, because it has less bandwidth to process transactions, but it just goes to show how hard it is to go against the consensus of the network. Bitcoin devs are working on a way to scale the network without having to disrupt it so much, including fitting more transactions into the same block size(Segwit), and creating second layer solutions that can process transactions off the main blockchain(like lightning network)
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:36:51
Andreas Antonopoulos on it 
He does admit it might end up only being the reserve currency for the crypto world, but it's very unlikely to lose that spot since it will still be the most mature and battle hardened crypto. Other cryptos will certainly be used for more specific applications since Bitcoin itself will get harder and harder to upgrade, especially if a hard fork becomes necessary to upgrade it.

Interesting, never heard anything about an approach like that. How would you roll out the code to accept larger blocks though? Wouldn't the different versions fight each other over which version was true? Nodes ignore each other if they receive transactions from one they think isn't playing by the rules. Or would you basically just have degraded performance due to fewer nodes available as the update rolled out?

Those services for paying bills in the US are insane. 5-15% of the bill, or you can only pay bills that can be paid by credit card, no thanks. I can already pay credit card capable bills by a Shift card, and I wouldn't pay huge fees for ACH transfers when I can just use ACH on an exchange.

So everything is fine because 50% of Americans are impoverished enough to pay no taxes even though the cutoff is extremely low around $9500. Yes there are credits and deductions that can make that higher but they pretty much only apply if you're married, have children, or own a house.
My taxes are 26% and I make less than median in the area I live in, just about median for the US. I get no credits because I'm single and have no kids. And if I did they'd be way more expensive than those credits anyway. My cut was only about 1-2%. 
The upper class on the other hand just got a way bigger cut than anyone else, and as I said, they aren't spending that money in any way that stimulates the economy in any real terms.
I'm not part of any agenda except my own, and improving the situation for the people around me. There's no reason when making the cut that they couldn't have just cut for everyone below a certain point, like move the 0% bracket up to 25k. That is what Trump promised when he was elected. But instead they threw us a tiny cut to keep us placated and then gorged themselves. The tax plan Trump ran on would have cut my taxes in half, but instead they fucked us.

I'm not experienced in financial markets at all, but my feeling is that Bitcoin isn't worth as much as it's currently being priced at. 
Who knows, maybe it is, given how bad USD inflation is right now, and the general negative sentiment toward banks.
The craze at the end of 2017 was huge though, and you still have quite a bit of irrational hype going on. Also consider that the US is past due for an economic crash, which will almost certainly bring the price of bitcoin down.
There's no doubt in my mind that Bitcoin will be worth more in the future than it is now. Buying now and hodling will probably net you something, it's just a question of how much.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:10:56

There's a huge spike in transaction volume lately with all the new users and new interest in bitcoin in the last year, and it's taking some time for developers to scale the network to handle the increased volume.

Coinbase has both a markup on the market rate and a fee they collect for every transaction you do on coinbase itself(other than USD wallet to bank account and vice versa). You can avoid the markup/fees if you use their exchange GDAX though.
There's no specific fee for gains/losses, but you'd have to pay taxes on them at your marginal income tax rate(probably 15-22% if you have a job) if held for less than a year or according to the separate capital gains tax rates if held for more than a year(0% up to 38k). So if you hold for over a year you likely won't owe any taxes on it.

There's one thing I don't understand about Lightning Network. Can a transaction go through a node that doesn't have as much bitcoin staked as the transaction is? For example, if you try and buy something for 0.1btc, can it route through a node with &lt;0.1btc staked?
If not, wouldn't most BTC be tied up in keeping channels open? And wouldn't most users not be able to afford to run a node? It seems like it could be bad for the bitcoin economy if that's how it works.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:20:57
Normal people will probably just use mobile wallets. They're secure enough, more secure than cash. If they want someone else to handle the security they can keep it in an exchange/bank, nothing stopping them from doing that. I don't see why the average user would keep their money on a PC. People would probably be warned against that, or at least figure out not to when it hits the news that people keeping their money on PCs are getting it stolen.

I see bitcoin as a hedge against the US economy, because I fully expect it to have a major problem sometime soon. I wouldn't go all in on it though, especially since I want to HODL as much bitcoin as possible and not use it to transact for now. I pay my bills in fiat, keep an emergency fund in fiat for if I lose my job and my BTC is in the crapper, and then my fun money goes to BTC or to other hobbies. Why would I waste the little BTC I have on bills anyway? What if it just happens to be down 10% at the moment it pays a bill? I'd want to be in control of when I paid them even if I did pay them in BTC, considering the volatility.

It's based on the amount of data in the transaction which makes it confusing. If you just had one input, it would be $4 whether it was $15 you were sending or $150. Sending larger amounts may take more inputs though, which is more data that needs to go into the transaction, and thus would cost more

I heard that USD inflation was already 2% this year. I don't have a source for that though, maybe I heard wrong. Not a lot in terms of world economies but relatively high for what it's been in recent years.
I wouldn't call the current economy healthy though. Maybe companies are managing to pull profits out of their ass by playing financial games, but consumers have very poor purchasing power. Money has to be reentering the economy lower down to have a healthy economy. It's mostly at the top now, which is a bad sign of health. The last time it was this concentrated at the top was 1929, and look at what happened then. The lowered taxes on consumers is good, but the lowered taxes on big business and the rich is bad because they mostly use it to make more money by the safest means they can find. By and large the rich aren't angel investors or anything, they just rent seek or hoard their money, which doesn't create the kind of circulation you want to see for a healthy economy.

Yeah true, it's possible there are solutions in side chains and such that would never require a hard fork, which would be incredibly painful and threaten the existence of the hard forked version, like bcash is most likely doomed to fail.

Yeah, a lot of people think it's anonymous because it used to sort of be because it wasn't on regulators' radar. It really needs to be anonymous though because you can't assume what the government thinks is suspect activity. Just using the bitcoin network puts you on their radar in a way, and they may incorrectly identify an address to be associated with illegal activity or correctly but not to your knowledge. Or the address could be used for illegal activity in the future/past that you weren't involved in but they associate you with it after the fact.

Log into GDAX with your Coinbase login(their exchange that has zero transaction fees), hit Deposit in the order form view on the left, choose coinbase account, select the amount of BTC you want, and hit deposit funds. Then, click Withdraw in the order view, choose BTC Address, and paste the address to your wallet. You might try with a small amount from your total BTC just to get a feel for it.
None of those operations will generate fees or delays except sending to the wallet might take some time. You can check the status of the transaction on the coinbase dashboard.

If it had its own value it wouldn't correlate so strongly with BTC. What's the point in having it if it isn't worth more than BTC, and dips/rises pretty much every time BTC does? It seems like it's pretty much just fractional BTC for small transactions. Maybe there's more daytrading profit to be made from it since it does get pumped and dumped, but as far as HODLing I'd rather have the BTC. Long term it's trending down with respect to BTC too. The graph of its price in BTC is very similar to Dogecoin.
A good coin to HODL along with BTC is one that's rising in value with respect to BTC and has it's own use, like Monero. It has a very strong upward trend in BTC price, and strong anonymity won't come to Bitcoin for some time.

I feel a little bad for everyone getting conned by Bcash, but I guess that's what you get for not doing the homework to understand what you're putting your money into.

I wonder how much value BCash has to lose before the final shill panic sells. Can't wait for it to disappear into obscurity like every other shitfork. They are trying so hard to get new buyers by stealing the bitcoin brand, domains, and social media, but the price is still falling.

I do, but I can imagine a lot of scenarios someone with less money than me could find themselves in that would cause them to overdraft.

I tried it out with LTC since it's the only thing that goes through GDAX in a reasonable amount of time right now, but it seems you can't sell to USD on Bithumb. So you'd need a korean friend to do the KRW to USD exchange probably, unless you identify a favorable trade from LTC to ETH or BTC.
If it were easy to arbitrate the prices probably wouldn't be so different
Edit: ~~Wow, bithumb sucks, I can't even get my LTC back out of it. The fees are more than the amount of LTC I have~~ Bithumb still sucks, but I managed to get half my $20 back out by exchanging it into ETH and withdrawing.

So you can predict what bitcoin is going to do by looking at the front page of youporn? :thinking:

Maybe bitcoin price as we see it is the scalar representation of a multidimensional value like that, and it's actually constant but our reality rotates around it causing us to see its value change.

It's not pending though, it posted to my account.

The big drops so far this year have been on Monday/Tuesday

I think there were ones that gave out 1btc, for sure at least 0.1btc

Just found this. Proof it's not just me, good enough for you? 
Apparently they did it to a bunch of people after they changed their classification to cash advance.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:21:31
I think they just did it to everyone who purchased on debit. Their subreddit is on fire. I'll wait a few days.

An ass whooping

Thanks for the response! Is there any chance you guys can send me some clean pants? I shit mine when I saw the 10 charges on my card when I woke up.

Well I have to run to work, no time to anonymize my bank statement for some asshole on the internet. Maybe later if you aren't the only idiot who doesn't believe me.
