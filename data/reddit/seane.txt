I listed on bitcoinblackfriday and did not receive any visitors from the site (not to mention sales).  Pretty disappointing, but I understand that my business is not as common as shirts or beer or something :)
(I run an SEO/consult business... which I know have pretty bad reputations).  
Also, the prices start at over $200, so it is not unexpected!
I'm glad to see many other merchants had a good Bitcoin Day! :D

I don't expect to get any clients from this, honestly, I'm just getting into bitcoin and, like I said, am excited!
Anyway, super skeptical redditor, I don't blame you, I would be, too.  I was actually gonna post this Monday or Tuesday when more people might have seen it (and there was more content on my site), but I have nothing else cool to post for my cake day, because I *really did* just realize it.

What are the altcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:47:26
yes, what is your website address?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:19:33
Yeah buddy.  In it for the long haul.  I feel you.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:08:03
If only! :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:05:24
ahaha :)

If only. :)
I think the exchanges would be (even more of) a disaster if people could cancel their transactions if the price drops in the mean time.

what does the age of a reddit account have to do with pointing out one of the rules in the sidebar?
"Please avoid repetition — is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. "
Genuinely curious.  2 yr. Redditor here, if that matters to you.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:57:16
Yeah.  I don't want to give the impression I'm panicking or anything.  I think it'll come back.  
Ten, though.  Wow.

I do have a non-bitcoin business.  It's my actual business (got a license and everything), so I do take USD.  The bitcoin site is a passion project, marrying bitcoin (which I love) and SEO (which I love).  
Check my regular site at   I really can help you out!

Not bad!  550 could be a good buy.  But, you know.  Hindsight 20/20 and all.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:10:33
Thanks!  I missed the first last year, but was commenting over in and saw my little slice o'cake.

Ah, I see I fed the troll.  My bad.  
Gotta pay the troll toll?
