I hate to put an end to all the Scientology conspiracy theories (if that's even possible) but we were just having some fun with the Xenu test.
To answer a few questions:
StealthCoin will not be the name of the new currency.  StealthCoin is not based on Bitcoin, it is not a fork of Bitcoin and it does not utilize the Satoshi Blockchain.  How exactly it works will be revealed to applicants we're seriously interested in hiring, and eventually to the world when the project is open sourced.
We've been studying Bitcoin for over a year and we've had plenty of time to understand the "deep technical issues."  For this project to have a chance at success it'll require a full-time effort of probably 6 months from at least 3 people.  This is time that we, the investors, don't currently have.
Compensation for the jobs will be somewhere in the $75k-$150k/yr range.  We'd be happy to pay in Bitcoin but we expect to pay in USD.
The StackOverflow job post links to Bitcoin.org because SO required a URL for the job posting and we don't have a URL of our own.
We're still hopeful that Bitcoin will sort its issues out and take over the world but we're not counting on it.  Core developers being employed by private businesses and prime Bitcoin domains being controlled by exchanges doesn't inspire confidence.  It's not that Bitcoin is a terrible implementation, it's just that we think we have a better implementation of a P2P decentralized currency, and we think we can do a better job of guaranteeing that its development and adoption are sustained.
As you might imagine, while we've been studying Bitcoin over the past year, we've also been accumulating Bitcoins.  StealthCoin is in part an attempt to hedge our bet.  If StealthCoin proves to be a better solution, we'll be rewarded, and if Bitcoin wins out our holdings there will certainly improve in value enough to pay for our investment in StealthCoin.
