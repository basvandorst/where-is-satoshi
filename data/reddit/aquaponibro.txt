No there isn't. The chance is closer to absolutely fucking zero. Who do you think you're dealing with here?

I'd wager any sum that he has layers and layers of encryption like some kind of grotesque crypto-onion.

They all acted the same way regardless of the teacher. You could have brought in someone who usually ranks very highly but they'd still end up in the exact same place. I only went for a semester but that school was so depressing the administrators would try to vent to me about how bad their job was and I was only a kid. But they were right, the people working there are delt a shit hand, nobody except the honors kids were interested in working. Honors was like a normal level classroom, just normal kids who actually wanted to do work.
I'm not going to get in to why it was that way because it is somewhat irrelevant to my point that your metrics are a terrible idea. Why? Poor test-retest reliability and poor predictive validity when you make an instructor change districts. 


I suppose if the metrics had small granularity and don't try to make apples to orange comparisons (eg, Beverly Hills vs Compton) they could be of use.

I'm far left. I like bitcoin. It is clever. I like central control over money (see: Kucinich's NEED Act). Bitcoin has its place though. As long as it is not accepted as legal tender for taxes, central control of money will always be viable. True central control would have the government get its money by just creating out of air instead of taxing, but a small LVT could maintain the need for state approved tender.

You should be saying "minarchism" instead of "libertarianism." This is because libertarianism encompasses both minarchism and anarcho-capitalism.
Few libertarians can survive the cognitive dissonance required to give an unqualified endorsement of anarcho-capitalism. Particularly when the form of AnCapism in question is the horrific Nieztschean kritarchy described by Rothbard.

Under the NEED Act full reserve banking would be in place and the banks would be prohibited from engaging in usury. It would hack the head right off the banking system. 
In any case, state issued currency will never collapse so long as taxes can be levied. Some taxes like property and land value taxes are not capable of being dodged.

I'm not a fan of this guy, but you've just written a recipe for screwing over every teacher in South Central. I went to school there. The teachers are sometimes pretty good, but Jesus Christ you have no idea what they are dealing with.

 Occupational attainment can be predicted to a high degree of accuracy simply by knowing a person's General Mental Ability (r=.60) and Conscientiousness score on the Big 5 (r&gt;.20).

True story. There is truth to the Jew thing; AIPAC is more powerful than the president. 




But apparently it is not PC to point out the ridiculous amount of power Jews are wielding in our politics. *shrug*

This is the future of the Republican Party, folks.
It is far more logical, but it has unfortunately become prone to economic extremism. What could be more extreme than embracing the economics of anarcho-capitalism? The Republican Party of the '80s wasn't interested in tearing down welfare, SS, Medicare/Medicaid completely though they wanted to snip at them. 
A mixed bag. One step forward on social issues, two steps back on the economy.
