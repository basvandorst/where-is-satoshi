I’ve seen a lot of coin star machines with the Bitcoin sign at Tom Thumb store locations. I’m in Frisco,Texas north of Dallas.

Inverted  Bart from the $6,000.
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:37:05
I just got the same message.
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:47:09
Nope. I’m waiting to add to my position.
I was just saying a correction is coming.
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:22:07
Correction target: 4800 - 5200
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:53:57
I did.
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:32:23
I have plenty of coins.  I’ve been buying on the dips. From what I’ve read, we are still in a bear market. Another correction may be coming. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 02:29:20
Just purchased 100k.

Bitcoin dropping below 6000 next!
Soft shoulder, going to almost 2X low.
@_date: 2018-04-29 22:30:03
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:20:41
Hodl until it’s high &amp; sell.
Buy when it’s low!!
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:58:54
Coinbase can suck it. They stop my purchasing abilities at the lows for no reason. I had to buy in with Abra!
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:40:03
I bought in with Abra. I’m good!
You, Coinbase, &amp; your mom can suck it!
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:49:33
Do your research!
You dumb Af!
@_date: 2018-04-20 04:22:40
The company for those machines is Coinsource.
I’ve used them before. They charge 8% after your first deposits.  Those  were my early days.
I recommend the Abra app. No network fees on deposits.
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:13:19
Lol! ��
Bitcoin going to 5500-5800!
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:09:15
Buy dips not sell!
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:59:28
This is so true!
