same here brother. . .it's the worst feeling watching it climb when you're trapped behind admin

like all the rest it's the small amounts that need no approval but going over 2k you need to jump all kinds of hoops. I've got a 15k I'm interested in investing. I've settled on QuadrigaCX now and wired the money but it only clears to my account on tuesday at the earliest.
Thanks for the link though.

It's incredibly fucking frustrating that Ive been trying to buy since last week. Bank transfers and ID approvals are really dragging as a foreigner living in Canada. Earliest would be by Tuesday. It's killing me slowly watching it climb without being on the train.

thanks for that frantic reply. I managed to get going on Quadriga so I'm all good now.

yeah. . but if I was able to buy when I wanted to then I'd have made money already. . my gains in the end would be even higher. Instead now I'm stuck behind admin. 
I know in the long run it'll be ok but right now I'm incredibly frustrated

this post is comforting. knowing that there 'might' be an end to this. I know it's not guaranteed but it's nice to know these feelings fit in somewhere

yeah.  I understand that. Maybe I should have been more clear. 
if you wanted to move it all in like a day or two. The slow sell will take quite a while to chip away at 250,000 and the constant selling like that will surely affect the market which in turn would negatively impact your final amount. 
Wouldn't it be best to somehow flash sell? Which is where my question comes from  - is it possible to flash sell all of that?

This makes sense yeah. I wonder after how long your constant selling would influence the market and to what degree.
Now minimizing the tax hit would be another story
