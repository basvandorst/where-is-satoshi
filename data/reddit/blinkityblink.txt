Ok so what exactly is a hard fork and what is all this segwit things? It's unclear to me. I thought it was one thing but it seems it is something completely different. Also I'm holding my NYC in electrum. Are thee any drawbacks to it?

i dont have alot of coins lol... I just started investing like 4 weeks ago.  ive only got like 40 bucks worth and their being stored in electrum
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:53:12
Im confused as hell. so i shouldnt store my coins in electrum? Ive done research and im still just straight confused. Whats wrong with having 2 chains other then hoping your coins dont get lost on the other chain if that is even possible?

thanks man! i completely forgot what i was confused about earlier. I did some more research and i guess i figured out what i needed to know. I plan on making the switch to bitcoin core instead of electrum. Would you recommend that or is it completely preference?

Since I took a liking into bitcoin this year my dad actually told me that he bashes himself everyday for not investing in it 5-6 years ago. He has told me for the past year "I always knew virtual currencies would be the way of the future" and things like "I loved the idea of bitcoin when I first heard of it"
