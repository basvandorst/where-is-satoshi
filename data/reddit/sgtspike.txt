It would be much better to increase the limit before we're at the limit. Otherwise, a sudden increase in userbase could prove to be catastrophic for bitcoin's reputation.

Because it leaves no room for a sudden increase in userbase. You tell me what happens when a bunch of new people want to try out Bitcoin, only to find out that their test transactions don't confirm for days because the 1MB blocks are so choked up.

This makes no sense. When fees are needed, they will be required. Until then, it is a useless excercise, and will only serve to exacerbate problems should we see a sudden increase in userbase.

I upvoted.  I don't think people truly understand how much of an effect this has on the price.  Gyft has sold tens of millions, amagi metals $10m+, that other metal vendor $10m+ as well, overstock and tiger direct more than a million, etc etc.  It's great to show support to merchants, and I've spent a lot of my own bitcoin this way.  But it DOES create constant selling pressure as all of these merchants convert directly to USD, and those bitcoins that are converted must be bought by someone else, driving the price further down.  It basically means that those tens of millions must be matched by tens of millions being invested into Bitcoin.  A bit different than mining coins, where some of the coins are kept and only some sold.

You can't send Bitcoin through twitter to pay for something you bought on newegg or from eBay though, and that's my point.  And you have no reason to trust the people behind those projects, whereas paypal is a rather reputable company for most users.  Besides, twitter &amp; reddit both use command strings to send payments, and as we all know, mainstream users don't like to have to remember syntax.  They like GUI systems.  Until there's a button on reddit or twitter to send payment and check balances, those systems are going to remain outside the realm of mainstream users.
I'd rather use Bitcoin than Paypal, but Paypal is my second choice to use whenever I'm buying something online.  It's much easier to log in and click "pay" than to whip out the old credit card.

The margin IS 1-2%, but that's AFTER all expenses related to the sales, including credit card fees, which can range from 2-7%.
If all of Overstock's business was done with Bitcoin, but they sold at the same prices, they would more than double their profits due to the amount saved on credit card processing fees.

Part of the algorithm for creating a public address from a private key is a hash with entropy of only 160 bits.  So there's 256-bits worth of entropy in private keys, but many of those private keys will lead to the same public address because of the 160 bits entropy in creating the public address.  This being the case, you only need to calculate one private key for each public address.
BUT, since you're talking brute-forcing and private keys are not derivable from public addresses (obviously), you'd statistically need to calculate just about all of the private keys in the 256-bit space before you actually had a match for each 160-bit public key.
I'd call your answer closer to correct than 2^160.

The point is to protect consumers and try to prevent illegal activities.
As much as I don't like regulation, I do like being assured that the company holding my coins is actually holding my coins.  There's been so many bitcoin "hacks" and "thefts".  If I'm going to entrust thousands of dollars to a company I don't know, then I'd feel a lot better about doing it if they have a BitLicense and are complying with everything on the list.  Yes, it is cumbersome and expensive, but that's part of the point, right?  It keeps the small players, the amateurs, out of the game.

I think the python remark because python requires that python be installed.  And then you have the additional complication of a python install not always setting the system paths properly so you can't just launch it from any directory.  I always assumed python had to be initialized via a command line too.
Anyway, if a gui can be done with python code without the user having to install python, that would be ideal.

Absolutely.  The new name shouldn't be new at all - we should just continue to call them Bitcoins.  The knee-jerk reaction is that we don't want to confuse people, but honestly, who is going to be confused between an online album (for example) price of 0.01 BTC vs 10,000 BTC.
Stock splits happen all the time.  Historical prices are adjusted accordingly, and that's that.  Obviously Bitcoin is a bit more complicated than a stock split, but I think it is absolutely doable.  The change will be a huge benefit to Bitcoin, as people will be more willing to get into it at a price of $0.0005/unit instead of $500/unit.
Plus, a news headline of "Bitcoin Shares Split 1,000,000 to 1!" just sounds great.  :D

I more wanted to use it as a statement that there are people out there (myself included) who really don't like using command-line interfaces, so if people want to encourage those types to use p2pool or whatever other non-centralized method of mining, they should come up with a gui interface for it.

Well certainly, regulations that help nothing at all won't solve any problems.  I support good regulations.  I don't support bad ones.  All I'm saying is, GOOD regulations could help protect consumers and merchants (even the stupid, lazy ones).


It truly is sometimes.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:37:18
I think this goes against the majority view here, but I am HUGELY concerned with the number of hacks and "hacks" going on.  It's a significant detriment to the Bitcoin name; even if people understand that Bitcoin itself isn't being hacked, they still take it as the Bitcoin marketspace being filled with scammers and criminals, and as it being difficult to secure one's Bitcoins (which even the community here admits to).  And these are important barriers to overcome if we ever want to see Bitcoin truly reach mainstream usage.
With that said, I believe regulation is important, and large use of Bitcoin in developed countries will only happen when regulation is in place with similar consumer protections as what already exists.  People don't WANT to be responsible for securing their own funds - they want banks and such to do it for them.  Until people can trust the banks/exchanges, they won't want to jump in on Bitcoin.  And trustworthiness of banks/exchanges will only come if they can be regulated and audited.  I couldn't tell you exactly what that regulation and auditing should look like, only that it should prevent exchanges/banks from running on fractional balances and that it should prevent any person or group of people from running off with the exchange/banks bitcoins.
I think the fact that any online MSB has to register in all 50 states is a huge barrier to entry for any small-time entrants into the industry, but at the same time, I'm beginning to think this is a good thing.  We've had too many examples of outright amateur coding, security, and business decision-making.  It's time to let the people who know what they're doing to take the helm.
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:40:39
It's amazing!  And they've saved over $50,000 in fees?  I'm assuming wire transfer fees made up the bulk of fees for international transfers, but even still, that's a good 1,200 transactions to make up $50k!
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:39:38
And why, exactly, would they want to do this?  It would be useless without the surrounding Bitcoin ecosystem, and no existing Bitcoin users would support such a thing.
There's no reason they can't color their own coins without criminalizing or blacklisting the rest.
@_date: 2014-01-17 06:52:38
Right - they don't need to use Coinbase or Bitpay.  They already have that service (Paypal), and they will trade with existing exchanges as needed but mostly match buys and sells internally.  Paypal integrating Bitcoin would be incredibly easy for them, they just need to see enough usage of Bitcoin to make it make sense.

Stock splits are traditionally GOOD news, not bad news.  It's a sign that the company is doing well, well enough that their stock has too much value per share compared to other companies in the same industry, so they must reduce their per-share stock price via a stock split.

They know Bitcoin is the next big thing, and they WANT to invest in it, they just don't have the means to do so right now.  Clicking "Buy" on an ETF?  That's what they know how to do.

One problem though - self-regulation requires someone (or sometimes many people) to become the "fall guy" prior to a scammer becoming known.  Government regulation could prevent ANYONE from being scammed in the first place.

Anyway, if you do want to try to reach the Bitcoin community as a whole with your furniture business, I have three suggestions:
1) Bitcointalk.org.  It's the biggest Bitcoin forum out there.  Make posts, not ads.
2)  Promotions and giveaways.  Post on places like Reddit often so that people don't forget about you.  But in order to do that, you'll have to post about something new or interesting, which is where the sales or giveaways come in.
3)  Ads or mentions of support on various bitcoin websites.  Become THE Bitcoin furniture vendor.

Good information, I'm not surprised.
So then take that razor-thin profit, add in the expense to modify it to accept Bitcoins, and how many additional customers said vending machine would gain due to Bitcoin acceptance (hint: probably one or less), and it just doesn't pencil out.
When Bitcoin is much more widely used and accepted, things like Bitcoin-enabled vending machines will make more sense.  OR, when vending machine manufacturers start adding it by default.  But I think we're still a number of years away from that point.

I really hate that people keep spreading this misconception around.  Bitcoin does NOT make Paypal useless.  Paypal can still act as an escrow provider, currency exchanger, and payment simplifier (people can pay to an email address).  What's more is, Paypal can lower their fees for Bitcoin transactions since they themselves won't have to worry about chargebacks, fraud, or large banking fees.

I'll disagree with that notion just because that's always how any scarce resource has been distributed - money.

The general consensus is that one of two things will happen:  Bitcoin will eventually become worthless, or eventually be worth at least 100x what it is today.
Reason being, the price is largely dependent on how many people are using it.  If more people are using it, it has to be worth more in order to accommodate the usage.  But if Bitcoin dies (for whatever reason), then it will be worthless.
I really believe that Bitcoin is here to stay, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend people buy at least a small amount of it (even just $10 worth).

@_date: 2014-05-05 22:54:16
I don't think so, just because people are noobish.  Numerous people have told me that they lost access to their wallet for whatever reason.  If they lose access to their wallet, they would also lose access to be able to change Bitcoin addresses without some manual intervention from me.  As it is, if they lose their address they can simply post a new one.
I think the ideal platform would be a custom form with three fields - username, password, and BTC address.  The username and password would have to match their forum account in order for any changes to take effect (and thus I would need to know how xenforo stores passwords), but it would certainly make for a more user-friendly method than what is currently in place...!

Some company needs to dig in and find out exactly why though, and what can be done to remedy it.
My guess is it has less to do with Apple not liking people making payments with Bitcoin (they allow Paypal to do the same), and more to do with lack of security typically surrounding Bitcoin wallets.  Apple doesn't want to be held responsible in the event that someone's phone is stolen or lost.  But the bottom line is, no one really knows WHY Apple refuses to allow Bitcoin apps in the app store... hence, a face to face visit with the place until proper answers are given is warranted.

While this is true, I'm much more concerned with the Bitcoins simply being absconded with by the exchange or lost in a "hack", as has been happening so often recently.  A properly regulated exchange would have a much smaller chance of either of those things happening.  Theoretically, that's what regulation is for - to protect both consumers and merchants from activity that could harm them.  Regulation has gone much too far, sure, but my hope is that some happy medium can be found.
It helps that it is incredibly easy to operate without regulation though - that'll pressure regulators to keep things reasonable or people will simply jump ship to the unregulated entities.


I certainly hope this is what will happen.  At this point, I'd even be happy with private inspection of balances (which would be better than what we currently have - nothing), but public would be ideal.

* They don't trust the existing exchanges
* They don't trust a 3rd party from another country with their bank account information
* They don't want to give out their identification information
* They're really desperate for drugs
* They just want to dabble in Bitcoin to see what it is all about, and a 25% premium on $25 worth isn't really a big deal
* Similar to the above, a journalist needs to quickly acquire BTC because they are writing a story on it and need to make transactions with it or know better how it works
* Even people signed up on an exchange can't get instant funding - they have to wait for bank transfers to complete before they can purchase BTC.  Maybe someone is $20 short of a $600 purchase (using BTC), and just wants it as quickly as possible even if it costs them an extra $5.

It doesn't say that profits cannot be distributed to shareholders or anything else, just that if profits are to be invested, they should be invested in those specific things.  Basically, they don't want a company to take its extra money and put it all into penny stocks or something equally stupid.

Maybe it is to prevent money laundering via purchase of shares of illegitimate companies?

No, the alarm would be ghash.io doing something nefarious with their hashpower.
They wouldn't get very far, the nefarious activities would be quickly corrected for, and they would forever ruin the reputation of their pool.
I am absolutely not concerned about any pool holding a large amount of hashpower, because the people can take away the power of the pool.
I would be concerned, however, if a single person or company had close to 50% of the hashpower all by themselves, because the people cannot take away such power.

No, but it is the best method we have to make that determination.  Otherwise, someone who is reaching 100 people/day with bitcoins.com could refuse to give it up to someone who could reach 100,000 people/day with the same domain.

You apparently don't want Bitcoin to be used by anyone but the geekiest.  I would rather see Bitcoin brought into the mainstream market.


Obviously if it was that simple, then people wouldn't have lost hundreds of millions of dollars via MtGox.  Also, there are many other failures that happened much more quickly.  I lost 12 btc in the Bitfloor hack, for example.  No one could have foreseen the hack, other than guessing it might happen since Bitfloor was run by an amateur.  This is where the regs will help - ensuring that Bitcoin companies are actually storing coins securely and properly.


Guess what?  Sometimes you NEED someone else to hold your money!  Like, if I want to buy or sell some BTC for fiat, for example.  Or if I want my bitcoins to be accessible from multiple devices while still maintaining 2FA.  Or if I want to have bitcoins held in an account for the ability to instantly purchase things without waiting for confirmations.  Etc, etc, etc.  Besides, if the mainstream is ever to get into Bitcoin, they very much need someone else to be in charge of the security of their bitcoins, because rest assured, most people are not capable of protecting a Bitcoin stash from theft by themselves.

Domain names are a scarce resource, and being able to resell them ensures that they are distributed in an effective manner (i.e., those who can make the best use of highly-sought domains are willing to pay the most, thus they will get the domain and be able to make the best use of it).

Since OP specified finding ALL Bitcoin private keys, I still maintain that you would need to find nearly all of the 256-bit keyspace to truly find every public address in the 160-bit space.  At the very least, you'd have a 50% (ish) chance of finding all of them with a 255-bit search, would you not?  But the chance of finding every single one with a 2^165 bit search would be absolutely miniscule.

I agree with you.  However, when you export transactions from QT (or any other Bitcoin client), you cannot tell what addresses the coins have been sent from.  The work involved in compiling such information is likely not worth the potential net savings.  But if you find a way to do it, go for it!
FIFO is a safe bet though, and easily compiled from transaction data.

That's fine, but you're missing the point that people will ALWAYS be lazy/inept.

The reason for this is for ease of verifying identities.  You don't want people changing each others bitcoin addresses.  The best way to do it is in-game, but the next best is through an existing secure username-based platform.
On a google form, I could write in anyone's name and collect their BTC.  Or change the BTC address associated with their name and collect their BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:06:47
You're missing the point though - if you were able to do that, people would lose all trust in Bitcoin and no one would want them.  If no one wants them, then suddenly all the bitcoins you sent to yourself are worthless.
Perhaps they could pull a quick con selling a bunch of coins on an exchange before anyone noticed, but withdrawing a significant amount of fiat is never easy, and the number of buyers lined up to buy additional coins is limited.  My bet would be they would make much less money trying to pull a con like this than they would by simply continuing to run their pool and selling Ghash contracts.

People always talk about the possibility of 51% attacks, but why would anyone holding that much Bitcoin hashpower choose to undermine Bitcoin in such a manner?  What benefit could possibly come to them from it that would negate the negative aspect of suddenly having a completely useless mining farm?
Also, I don't think mining will ever become centralized enough that the whole system could collapse.  If a miner goes under, another one (or a bunch of them) will inevitably take their place.

And really, the proposal isn't that bad for any medium-sized company.
People are getting all upset over these requirements, but the reality is, if someone is holding my Bitcoin, I want to be sure those bitcoins are safe.  I'm tired of being goxxed/bitfloored.  If a company has a BitLicense, and they're complying with everything on this list, it gives me a much higher level of comfort that my bitcoins are going to be safe with them.  I don't want an amateur small business holding money on my behalf, [because we've seen what happens when they do](

Except if they audit.  They'll ask for your Bitcoin addresses, and you'll have to provide them.  Unless you've been doing a dang good job of keeping certain addresses separated from the others, they'll be able to find out what other addresses are yours if you try to give them only partial addresses.  And then you go to jail for tax fraud.
Now that this publication came out, I'll be (unfortunately) filing an amendment and paying a great deal more in taxes for 2013.

A couple things...
1)  Paypal integrating Bitcoin would mean that people with a Paypal account could pay a merchant in Bitcoin even if they didn't own any Bitcoins.
2)  The paypal fees are paid by the merchant.  The $0.06 is paid by the consumer.  So from a financial perspective, consumers should prefer paying by Paypal instead of Bitcoin, unless they are offered a discount to pay with Bitcoin, because they save $0.06.

But only if that mining behavior produces a benefit greater than said cost.  If it costs you 1 BTC to mine, and the benefit produced is adding 0.000003% of security to the network (which is what a single high-end video card would add), then I would argue that it is NOT beneficial to mine.  The security added is so negligible as to be utterly worthless, and the lost 1 BTC is still a lost 1 BTC.

Even using GPUs, it would take 5,000 - 10,000 computers to make up for a single 1.5 TH/s miner.  And the computers would burn around 2MW of power vs 1KW for the ASIC.

Most people using BTC also still use USD or other fiat currencies.  They probably didn't have to sell BTC to pay for their subscription.  There's also a few people in this thread who have mentioned subscribing just to support their decision to accept Bitcoin.  But the bottom line is, if anyone isn't replenishing their BTC they spend on DISH, then the result is downward pressure on the price.
Don't get me wrong - I LOVE that DISH has done this and think it's an excellent thing for Bitcoin as a whole, but any vendor who immediately sells BTC they receive IS putting downward pressure on the price.  That's not to say that the price is going to go down because of this, because there are other forces at play, but one of the downward forces is now DISH (unless they happen to be holding the BTC they receive).

Agreed, this is excellent.  Anyone who wanted to hold instead of spend because their money might be worth more tomorrow would be investing in something anyway.  Holding Bitcoin is just one of many ways to invest money.
And the author hits on the sticky wage issue, which is certainly an issue if Bitcoin were to ever become the dominate denomination for things like paychecks.  For now, denominating wages in USD but paying in equivalent BTC works fine.

You have to have an account and be logged in.  I had the same inquiry last time this came up and that's what I figured out.  I guess they figure that paypal automatically gives the seller a place to send the goods to the buyer, but Bitcoin doesn't, so Bitcoin requires an account.

I honestly see this as a good thing.  At this point, I would much rather trade on an exchange with regular auditing and security regulations to ensure that the guys in charge aren't just going to randomly run off with my money or lose it in a hack.

No.  Paypal has fees because they provide escrow services and because they have credit card/bank fees to pay for.  If eBay integrated Bitcoin, it would be through Paypal, and Paypal could continue to charge fees for their services (namely escrow, but also currency conversion, etc).  They could potentially charge users lower fees for Bitcoin transactions than CC/bank transactions too, which would be excellent free advertising for Bitcoin.

All of your arguments depend on a person being technically adept and knowledgeable.  I can guarantee 90% of people worldwide wouldn't have the slightest clue how to accomplish half of the verifications you are talking about.
So, if that's the world you want Bitcoin to remain in - only available to those with enough intelligence and knowledge to ensure the security of their own money - then I'll just say that I think it will severely limit the potential adoption of Bitcoin.

Sorry, I should have specified that I meant advantages for wall street.  
Wall street doesn't care about mining or the community, and the black market isn't an issue anymore (people smartly realized that hey, USD is used for the same thing!).  As far as it still being in the early stages, sure, but that's only relevant when taking a long-term outlook, and I don't think anyone sees dogecoin as viable long-term.  Certainly, it is much riskier than Bitcoin to put any money into, so I don't see why any wall street exec would want to waste their time playing with play money instead of using the real deal.
Don't get me wrong, I think it's excellent (and hilarious) that dogecoin even exists.  It obviously peaks a certain demographic's interest and helps them investigate this whole cryptocoin thing.  I'm just saying that dogecoin is NOT what we should be approaching wall street with.  It's like giving an RC car to a NASCAR driver.

That's exactly what I am saying.  How many times, in the last 5 years, have people lost money from a bank in the US and been unable to recover it or be reimbursed?  What was the total value of that lost money, as a percentage of the overall dollar amount in circulation?


I trust any official banking institution to hold my money and have it available when I need it.  So, I don't know, how many banks are there in the US?  Tens of thousands?


That's just it though - the end result in NOT the same.  Sure, you can say that governments are "stealing" money via taxes, but that's not every penny you have.  In a Bitcoin scam/theft/hack, it IS every penny you've entrusted to that entity.


I don't want to turn it into USD.  Regulated bitcoin is not the same as USD, I'm not sure why you are trying to draw that comparison.  I can still send Bitcoin to anyone in the world without a third party if I want to, and the fees are still much cheaper than they are with any other method of sending digital payment.  There is much benefit to be had, and little of that is lost just because Bitcoin companies have to follow certain regulations.

You're not asking the customer to bear any risk beyond what they would be taking if they sold their BTC and used the USD to buy something they wanted.  It's pretty clear that your pricing is in USD, not BTC, thus any refunds would be the BTC equivalent of the original USD amount of the purchase.

To be honest, I don't see the consolidation of mining as much of a problem, as long as their goal is profit and not the failure of Bitcoin (which, as far as I am aware, profit is the only goal of all of them).  Let's review the possibilities:
1)  They could pull a 51% attack on something.  Perhaps an exchange.  Maybe they are able to sell 10,000 coins, then reverse the transaction by re-producing a longer chain over time discluding their original 10,000 coin transaction.  However, this would be obvious, and likely be considered theft by a court of law.  $5M is a lot of money, but almost a drop in the bucket compared to how much it would cost to get enough hashing power to have 51% of the coinage.  If a pool tried this, miners would move away from the pool and make a concerted effort to reestablish a chain that includes the original transaction.  All in all, I don't see this working out with a positive net profit for anyone who tried it.
2)  They could refuse to process any transactions.  They could do this by having the majority hashpower and only including their own blocks.  They would maintain the longest chain, and no one could make any transactions because of it.  However, this would kill Bitcoin's value, since it would render it unusable.  It would be pointless for the controlling miner, and any stake they held in Bitcoin would be worthless.  Now they have a huge mining farm they spent tens of millions on that now mines a worthless currency.
3)  They could refuse to process any transactions for free, or only process transactions with a high fee attached to them.  Again, this would make Bitcoin's value plummet, so if profit is the motive, a large miner would be ill-advised to attempt something like this.
I just don't see a scenario that means we really have to worry about anyone with a large amount of hashpower.  Anyone who has built a multi-million dollar mining facility would really want to see Bitcoin succeed, and would do nothing to hinder that, because that is where their greatest potential profit lies.

You are correct.  Lite clients connect to servers which store the full blockchain.

Yes it is... unless his apartment's electric heating is something more efficient than just electric coils.  Every watt used by a computer is, at least eventually, turned into heat.  Light is absorbed by surfaces in the form of heat.  Sound is absorbed by materials, and turns to heat.  Air movement is slowed down by friction with non-moving air, creating heat.  If a computer uses 1000w to mine BTC, then it will produce exactly the same amount of heat as a 1000w heater.
The only caveat is that a computer may not be as efficient with distributing that heat around the room as an electric heater with a strong fan would be.

I think we're looking at shooting up to 200-500 TH/s within a couple of months of the shipment of the first units, as long as BFL holds up their end of the bargain to supposedly ship these new units much more quickly and streamlined than the prior gen.  If BFL is as slow as they have been shipping out the old units in shipping out the new units, it could be a year before we see 100 TH/s.

To further expound upon this, the network will scale according to the fees people are willing to pay.  If people are willing to pay, on average, a 1% fee, then the electric costs would only equate to 1/10th of the electric costs you mention.  Bitcoin mining will never (or very rarely) exceed the electric costs using the following formula, once the block reward is effectively gone:
electric cost &lt;= [market cap] * [average fee] / [monetary velocity]
So really, the amount "wasted" on electricity is entirely dependent upon the fee people are willing to pay to conduct transactions.

You hit on some of the same annoyances that still bother me, even though I've been involved with Bitcoin for almost 2 years now.  The QT client is largely aimed towards the tech-savvy crowd and I don't believe it should be advertised at bitcoin.org.  A more user-friendly client should be advertised instead, in my opinion.
Regardless, QT 0.8 will be coming out soon, which changes the way the data is stored and will drastically reduce the time to sync.  Ultimately though, the "general public" should use lite clients or web clients.  Blockchain.info is a really good web client that I always recommend to new Bitcoin users.  User-friendly, not resource-intensive, but still secure to use, as all of the important computing is done on each clients' computer.
I've also often requested an easy (read: GUI) export of the wallet, but the devs refuse to comply.  I think this would be a very useful feature.
Someone correct me if I am wrong on any of these points:
1. Bitcoins are a transaction.  So it's nothing more than a record saying I transfered 50 Bitcoins from one address to another.
2. You just need the private keys.  The public keys are automatically calculated from the private keys.
3. It checks the public keys against the blockchain.  If it finds transactions with outputs towards those public keys, then your client notifies you of those outputs as a balance.  If it notices spends from any of those public keys, then your client reduces your available balance accordingly.
4. I really couldn't answer that.  I don't know enough about it.

I doubt ASICs will be replaced every year.  The more energy-efficient models will likely be competitive for at least 4.  There are no more GPU--&gt;ASIC-like jumps in speed or efficiency left.  The only efficiency increase that could come along is for process size decrease (i.e., from 65nm to 45nm or something), which would help, but it would only increase efficiency by maybe 15%-30%.  People aren't going to dump their prior-gen ASICs just because a new one is out that is 25% more efficient.

Also, if they were to, say, keep it to a reasonable level, and keep their level of mining to where they only held 30% of the total network hashrate, then they could make 32,400 BTC/month (after the drop to 25 BTC rewards).  Woohoo.  That pales in comparison to millions of dollars of sales they've already achieved in a couple of months.  And when a competitor comes out, they'll have to continuously invest in more hardware to keep up with said competitor, which will further erode those revenues.

No matter how efficient they get, since electric is really the only variable cost in mining, the profitability of mining will eventually trend towards the electric cost.

The biggest threat, in my mind, is that of a government entity creating their own ASIC (or purchasing a large number of them from current vendors).  If they acquired 51% of the network hash power, they could prevent all transactions from happening, and unless 51% could be reacquired by the users without said government increasing their own hash count, it would be the ultimate Bitcoin killer.

But how many IOPS?  That's the more important part - the head of your HDD is moving all over the place to gather info.
Think of it this way - for each transaction that your client downloads, it must verify said transaction by looking at the prior transaction.  And it has to find the prior transactions (of which there are sometimes dozens or hundreds) for each transaction to verify.  So each block could potentially have your HDD looking in a few thousand different places of the .dat file.  And a traditional HDD will only do a few hundred IOPS, meaning you'll be waiting a number of seconds for your client to process a larger block.
A solid state drive will do this operation much more quickly.

You can buy a lot with them.  I just sent my reddit SecretSanta recipient a gift directly from an online retailer, paying for it with Bitcoins.  See this page for more details: 
It doesn't cost money to use.  Completely free.  You can pay optional fees to help transactions complete faster, but it is not required.
Mining is the process of securing the list of transactions (so that no one can spend the same money in two places), and miners are rewarded with Bitcoins for helping to secure that list.

Please state a source for such a definition of inherent value?
If you say food or water has inherent value, I would agree.  However, that doesn't mean that food or water is equally as valuable to every individual at all times.  If I am thirsty, but not hungry, then I place a higher value on water.  Likewise, if someone else is hungry, but not thirsty, they place a higher value on food.  This value differential is what enables trade in the first place.  The food and water both have inherent value, as they are both necessary for living, but that value may change from individual to individual, and throughout time.
If you're trying to tell me that inherent value means that there is some universally agreed upon and exact value for anything, then I would say that inherent value doesn't exist at all.  There is nothing in the world that is equally valuable to all persons at all times.

Hmmm... they should really consider building in some sort of backdoor soon to allow this change in the future.  Maybe something along the lines of putting the hash of a secret in the code, so that if a block is hashed with this secret in the future, it is allowed to be up to 5 MB in size.  Then, if it is deemed necessary to utilize blocks larger than 1 MB, the secret could be released to the public, and anyone could begin hashing blocks up to 5 MB in size, with backwards compability for all clients back to 0.8.
There's probably a simpler/easier way to accomplish this, but I'm not a hardcore enough programmer to figure it out.

Then only buy from small merchants and individuals with good feedback and reviews.  Auction sites track feedback from individuals selling goods (see bitmit.net), and businesses are always being reviewed on a variety of sites that would enable you to make smart purchases.
On the contrary, a business cannot easily protect themselves from unscrupulous customers.  They could receive a payment via credit card or paypal, only to have it reversed months later and lose money on it.
Certainly, it is a difference in the way we might look at transactions done with businesses, but I believe it to be a change for the better.  I would rather have customers having to trust merchants than the other way around, since proper feedback solutions can be developed around merchants, but the same cannot be said about customer.
Any decent company will refund their customer in cases that the customer isn't happy, and that activity will be reflected in their feedback.  But a merchant has very little recourse if the customer reverses a payment on them.

Depends where you live.  In western Oregon, it doesn't get all that cold in the winter.  I don't think we've yet seen a night below freezing this year.  Many houses still use ceiling heat and baseboard heat (i.e., straight electric coils).  In fact, I have lived in one apartment and two houses since getting married, and all three had electric coil heating via baseboards.  And actually, I just replaced the baseboards in my current house with more electric coil heating - cadet in-wall heaters!  Much smaller fire-hazard footprint, and the fan helps get the heat out into the room more quickly, decreasing the need to have it on for quite as long.
So yes, plenty of people in their right mind would heat a house, and even an entire apartment complex with electric coils.

Consider further still that miners must make a profit BEYOND that electric cost, which means that when Bitcoin is pretty much a fees-only supported service, the fees brought in by mining must be greater than that $7B - $14B of electric costs.

I think the idea is, you would save to buy a house instead of buy a house and put yourself in debt.  The result is cheaper houses, since fewer people want to buy them, and higher rent, since more people want to rent.  But higher rent and cheaper prices would encourage more landlords to buy more houses, increasing the demand for houses, and thus the price.  And we're right back where we started.  Maybe.
I do agree that deflation would discourage spending in general, compared to inflation, but at the same time, I think we've overspent ourselves anyway.  Why are we in this economic mess?  Too much debt-based spending, both by consumers themselves, and the government.  With a non-inflationary currency, debt-based spending is curbed, and people start making better decisions with their money, having more freedom to spend it on what they want without being laden down with debt.
All of that said, I am not sure that a deflation-based economy would work well in today's modern world, but I'd sure love to see it happen and find out!

This will likely not end well.  If purchased with a stolen credit card or paypal account, the charge will be reversed regardless of whether you actually "shipped" the product or not.

What I'd like to know is, was any user aware of this "hedge fund service"?  If M4v3R was serious about providing a hedge fund service for his customers, what would have been the expected benefit?  Was he going to pay funds to the users if the BTC price dropped or something?
My suspicion is that it was never on behalf of the users at all - that M4v3R got greedy, got tired of running a service for free, and wanted to use the massive amount of BTC he was holding on behalf of other users to make a profit for himself.
@_date: 2012-12-17 16:45:38
I guess I am confused - how could a transaction with 20 0.01 inputs be overwritten by a "single 0.20 BTC transaction"?  Wouldn't it have to use the same inputs in order to overwrite the original transaction?  So the same 20 0.01 inputs were used to himself, they just included a transaction fee?
Secondly, I am confused why any miners or pools would receive the first transaction and still process the second.  I thought, if a transaction was waiting to be placed in a block, that miners would reject any incoming transactions from the same inputs?  Why is this not default behavior of the Bitcoin client?  It seems that it would protect against this sort of attack - simply wait for a transaction to propagate across the entire network, then you can be assured it cannot be double-spent.

I got into Bitcoin nearly two years ago, and I have thought the same thing the whole time.  A few things keep me here:
1.  It's not perfect, but, in my opinion, it's better than what we have (a system riddled with corruption, stuck in inefficient legacy formats, and controlled by a select few).
2.  Just like deflationary currency encourages underspending and underinvestment, I would argue that inflationary currency encourages overspending and overinvestment (i.e., too much debt).  I think you would have a tough time arguing with anyone that our economies around the world wouldn't be better off with a smaller ratio of debt to income, both from the citizens' standpoint and the governments'.
3.  Ideally (continuing from  the perfect currency would track GDP growth/monetary velocity and somehow, in a decentralized manner, issue or destroy currency as required to maintain the same value of the currency over time.  However, nothing like this exists yet, and I can't imagine a way to properly create such a system.
4.  Even the whole currency/political/inflationary/deflationary arguments aside, Bitcoin makes for an AMAZING payment system.  How else can a person pay anyone anywhere in the world instantly, and for free?
5.  Kind of going back to  my thought is that a Bitcoin-like currency with a never-ending block reward would be as close to perfect as we could get.  Eventually, the number of coins created each year would be equal to the number of coins lost (on average), creating a very stable supply with regards to number of coins circulating on the market.  However, such a system still would not account for GDP/population growth.
In summary, I agree with OP, but Bitcoin is quite an innovation, and I think those innovative features (cheap, fast, decentralized) overcome the downsides of a deflationary currency.

Let's see... would you rather approach a venture capitalist (who knows nothing of Bitcoin), and say, "Hey, I need $2M, and I'll make $12M in sales in a year," or "Hey, I need $2M, and I'll make 1.2 million of this funny internet currency"?
Also, another factor you haven't taken in to account:  If BFL was known to have more than half the hashing power of the Bitcoin network (which they undoubtedly would be able to achieve if they produced their own ASIC chips and mined on them before anyone else), all confidence in Bitcoin would immediately falter.  And when confidence falters, the price drops, like a rock.  And when the price drops like a rock, all those BTC that BFL is mining become worthless.  Suddenly, they are out a $2M investment, and it was all for nothing.
They are helping to preserve the Bitcoin network by getting ASIC miners into as many people's hands as possible, increasing confidence, the price per BTC, and, logically, their sales (higher BTC price = more sales).

He makes the business sound incredibly helpful to newbies.  Which is exactly who will be reading the article, and exactly who will end up purchasing Bitcoins through Bitinstant because of it.  Even though he is addressing Romney in the quote, he is really addressing all of the people who have just heard about Bitcoin for the first time.

I know some people who use Quickbooks have picked a currency symbol that is not automatically tracked by Quickbooks (it doesn't automatically download the exchange rate), and they use it as if it was the Bitcoin currency.  Quickbooks allows manual entering of the exchange rate.

I think it'd be cool if you told the person whether the firstbits were already claimed or not on a particular prefix.
If I wanted to claim 1sgtspike, then it would tell me that no one has yet claimed the firstbits for it.  If I wanted to claim 1sgt, then it would tell me that 1sgt already has been claimed as firstbits, but a different 1sgt address could still be generated.
Also, is your generator caps-sensitive?

@_date: 2012-08-23 21:21:09
I think we're finally starting to reach the point of critical mass (note: STARTING), as we're seeing a genuinely large amount of interest coming in without any extraordinary announcements correlating.  Word of mouth might be a major contributor to this.  In the comments of most articles that talk about Bitcoin that I have seen recently, the people know what Bitcoin is, but haven't jumped in.  This is a stark change from the "lolwut is Bitcoin" response that was seen largely with every new article last year.
Interesting times...

With Bitcoin, you can send money to anyone anywhere in the world, without a government or corporation being involved.  It is the only true equivalent to sending a person digital cash.
For merchants, it is the only digital money they can accept without worry of a customer chargeback or fraud later on.
Also, try to look past the current costs to set up and wait for Bitcoin transfers.  It isn't convenient right now, but that isn't the fault of Bitcoin, and it will get better (less fees, faster receipt of Bitcoin after purchasing them) as time goes on.  Really, look at it from the point of view of keeping a regular balance in your Bitcoin wallet that is ready to use at any time - then, you have no extra fees or wait times.

I started that thread:  
It includes Bitomat's fiasco, and I am certain that lots of people threw away wallets with thousands of BTC, but only coins that are for sure lost forever are tallied in the thread.
My personal guess is that at least 300k BTC are lost forever, many stuck in their original blocks from the early mining days.

Actually, the first block (after the genesis block) took 6 days to find.  ;)  After that, it seems as though they were found quite regularly, within the normal timeframe (maybe just over every 10 minutes).  There are still odd gaps in the time between blocks though.

I'm more curious about this statement:

A fix to the 0-conf problem??
@_date: 2012-09-26 22:35:13
Instawallet (and likewise, any online web wallet) could very well be tracking your IP.  If you don't want your IP to be tracked, download the Satoshi client from bitcoin.org, wait a day or two for it to sync up to the network, and send/receive Bitcoins from there.
They will receive it instantly, but it will take around 10 minutes per confirmation to confirm the payment.  Some services accept payments with 0 confirmations, some accept payments with 1 confirmation, and just about everyone will accept a payment with 6 confirmations.  So, bottom line is, it shouldn't take more than an hour.

Because I don't think it'll get that high in just four years.  We saw growth from $0.01 to $1.00 much more quickly than $30 to $3000.  Price growth naturally slows down as the price increases simply due to how much more money needs to be invested to move the price.

I've tried a lot of basic SQL injection stuff.  Only one seemed to be effective:
'; TRUNCATE TABLE users;
That didn't used to throw up the error, it would just refresh the page when I tried that in the username box.  Now, it seems, that particular injection has been fixed, as it throws an error again.  I tried it 3 times without throwing an error, then a bit later, tried it again, and it threw the typical login failed error.  Maybe the author of the site was tired of me dumping his user table?  But that tells me that the secret is likely a form of sql injection if this was let through and then later blocked.  I just can't find anything that works though.

Everything in the Bitcoin world is new.  It's not going to work perfectly.  Just like you are a first timer, blockchain.info is a first timer company as of a year ago.  Lots of kinks to work out, especially with translations, as they can't verify a lot of them themselves.  They need help from the community to make sure it is working well.

Here's another reason why it's overpriced:
- Buyer will receive unit, mine on it for a couple of weeks.
- Buyer will issue a dispute via PayPal, saying "Item not as described." Buyer will offer to ship it back.
- Paypal tells buyer to ship it back for a full refund.
- Paypal gives buyer full refund after seeing return tracking number delivered.
- Seller just lost 3 weeks of prime mining time, buyer gains 2 weeks of free prime mining time.

Maybe.  But it would certainly be a double-edged sword.  If Google did implement a wallet, and many people started using it, and someone found a way to hack into Google's servers and steal the coins (or a rogue employee, etc), then Bitcoin would be deemed forever worthless by the mainstream public.  Everyone would say "well, if Google can't secure an online wallet, no one will ever be able to secure an online wallet."

This is true.  Some are called 50/50, where 50% goes to the winner and 50% goes to a charity.  This is a less... noble cause, since OP is keeping the extra profits above and beyond what he could realistically sell the car for for himself.

Accountant here.  Assuming it is something that is claimable, you can only claim a loss on the purchase price of the coins (your basis).
So, if you paid $100 for 100 BTC, and you lost them all today ($14,000 worth), you could still only claim a $100 loss.  This is because you never reported the gain on investment as income (and you shouldn't, until/unless you sell them for USD).
Now on whether you can actually claim it... I think about.com actually explains it well (something they are typically inept at):






I would take this to mean that a hard drive crash resulting in the loss of your wallet would be deductible, but accidentally deleting your wallet file would not.

42% isn't the true number of people who know what it is though.  Just look at what the name is made up of - "bit" and "coin".  Does that go more along with a virtual currency (two words that are almost synonyms for the former), or with an xbox game or iphone app?

"What does a bitcoin hash look like?" should say "What does a bitcoin address look like?"  Many things in Bitcoin are hashed, and people generally refer to a bitcoin address as a bitcoin address, not a bitcoin hash.  May as well stick with the most-used terminology.
"watch thisvideo from Micon" needs a space.

I have done trades on MtGox, bitfloor, and VirWoX, but never bought Bitcoins on any of them - only sold them.  MtGox is my least favorite, but is decently cheap and the most trustworthy to not do something stupid.  Bitfloor isn't that trustworthy right now, in my opinion, but get in and get out quickly, and it'd probably be ok.  They are the cheapest in terms of fees.  VirWoX is probably the easiest to use, but you'll lose the most in fees.  Have to buy Linden dollars with USD (but you can use PayPal!), then send those Linden dollars to VirWox, then buy Bitcoins with them.  Sounds complicated, but compared to the other crap out there... yeah it's not too bad after all.

@_date: 2013-03-20 18:46:55
I don't believe $250k would cause a sharp drop at all.  It's really not much.  Volume on MtGox has been averaging 40k BTC over the last several months.  So $250k would be a whopping 10% of one day of volume.  And that's even assuming it was all sold at the same time, which it wouldn't be, at all.
Anyway, sell your coins, wait to buy back cheaper, and see if you're right.  ;)
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:46:48
Here's the interesting part about that:  No one KNOWS that Bitcoins will continue to go up in value.  So when Bitcoins are worth $100/ea, people look at that and think, "Well, hey, I can buy a laptop with the 5 BTC I have saved up now!  I should go do that before the price drops down and I lose the ability to spend them!"
And that is exactly how spending will happen in a deflationary economy.  Because it is risky to hold money - both from the possibility of a price drop and from the possibility of theft or accidental loss.

You know, I thought the same thing for a long time, until price appreciation really started happening rapidly.  I looked at prices of things and thought "Wow, I can buy THAT for only 0.28 BTC?"  And I have bought a couple of items just because of that that I would have never spent the BTC on earlier, when the price was lower.
The only reason I'm not buying a lot of stuff is because I am attempting to be fiscally responsible and use my BTC profits for paying off loans instead of buying things I would really like to have, but don't necessarily need right now.
So, the bottom line is, I don't think the psychological aspects of deflation work out exactly how economists typically predict they would.  It's kind of like how I went laptop shopping 6 months ago, and found, "wow, I can get a 3rd-gen i7 laptop with 8GB ram and 1TB HDD for only $485?  BUY BUY BUY!"  I've been finding myself having the same reaction when perusing through the bitcoinstore or bitmit and looking at how little BTC I have to spend to acquire any particular given item.

Under 10 years?  I think your calculations are a bit off...
If I invest 65% of $40,000 gross income per year into a 4% interest bearing investment, I would have just over $320,000 10 years from now.  4% of $320,000 means a yearly payout of $12,800.  That's a far cry from the original $40k annual gross income.

Funny, because I saved 40 BTC specifically for remodeling my bathroom.  As soon as the price is high enough to allow for what we want to do ($150-$200), I'll be making use of said BTC.  I'll have to keep this in mind, it'd be really awesome to pay for the vanity directly with Bitcoins!

It certainly could happen, but it would require an event (like you said, thieves washing their money) or a major feature that Bitcoin could not upgrade to in order to grab any significant traction in the first place.
If something comes along that is truly significantly better than Bitcoin is, then there's no doubt that it could replace Bitcoin.

I've had over 1,000 BTC come through my main address.  Some of that is me sending coins to myself, and so might be repeated, but the vast majority is coins that I earned through mining or through contract jobs, etc.
I currently have 55.
55 is nothing to scoff at, but it's incredibly easy to think about if I still had that original 1,000.
The bottom line is, you can't live your life with regrets - it will DESTROY you.  You did what seemed reasonable at the time given the information you had, and that's all anyone can expect of themselves.  The best you can do is take your previous experiences and learn from them.  As far as what I took from my experience, I plan to never sell more than 20% of my remaining holdings at a time, no matter how much I want to.  This will ensure I always have "skin in the game".  Also, I plan to set aside coins for specific purchases.  "When these 100 are worth $2,500 each, I plan to purchase a house with them".  Etc...

It's not correct to recognize revenue as whatever amount is received though.  If I sell 10 annual gold memberships for $20 (or whatever it is), then I would expect to receive $200 as a deposit.  When my actual deposit comes in at $232.48, I have to reconcile the difference.  I have fees that should have been paid (say, 0.99%), and the remainder of the difference would be gain on foreign exchange.
Journal entries might look as follows:
Cr Revenue - $200.00
Dr Payment Processing Fees - $1.98
Cr Gain on Foreign Exchange - $34.46
Dr Cash On Hand - $232.48

It's a valid point of view for sure.  Increased day-trading will help decrease the volatility though.  As more people are involved, it will be more difficult to move the price, because those people will be looking to make gains off of the price movement, thereby decreasing the movement with their anti-movement buys and sells.
I also absolutely agree that Bitcoin needs time.  It needs to prove itself, and that will only happen with history.
Overall, not a bad article.

Bitpay converts the BTC to USD.  They accept BTC from the person buying from you, and can convert it to USD that they deposit in your bank account.
They can also do a percentage, so you could have them convert enough of it to USD to cover your COGS, then keep the rest in BTC if you want.

Ok, so it's a WiFi Hotspot.  It says it's "much like a consumer router".  What's different about it?  What does Bitcoin have to do with it?  Is it something that people can buy to allow people internet access in exchange for Bitcoins?
The home page answers none of these questions, but I did find more information on the shop page.  I just feel like the home page should do a better job of explaining what is different about it compared to a consumer router and why I should want one.

The max block size of 1MB dictates that the blockchain cannot grow more than 52GB in size per year.  Therefore, in 10-20 years, the blockchain could not be more than 500-1TB.
Unless blocks are allowed more than 100MB in size, we will not reach petabytes in 10-20 years.
Also, look at the growth of hard disk drives.  20 years ago, a hard drive might have been 500MB.  Now we're up to 8,000 times that.  So 8,000 times our current hard drives (4 TB) means we'll have 32 petabyte drives in two decades anyway.

I've used gift cards on my phone with gyft at several stores.  Every time, the cashier looks at me like I'm trying to use some sort of black magic, but they scan the card anyway.  They're always surprised and overly delighted when it works and they cheerfully inform me of my remaining balance after I've already logged my purchase amount and know exactly what my remaining balance is already.
It's almost worth buying gift cards just for this experience.
Anyway, that's largely unrelated to your problems at Walmart (haven't used any cards there), but thought I'd share anyway.

The alphanumeric code is the public Bitcoin address.  The key you need to send those Bitcoins to another Bitcoin address is on a tiny piece of paper behind the hologram.  So, the hologram must be stripped from the coin in order to use it.  Casascius does not hold the coins on his server (he claims to delete the private keys for them) - they are held only on the coin itself.  The secret code can be imported into a multitude of Bitcoin clients.

How long does it take a waiter to take your credit card, swipe it, print out the receipt, have you sign it, and take it all away again?  I'm not sure why it would ever take minutes to relay a transaction, but even if it takes 20 seconds, it shouldn't be a big deal.  The waiter could take care of other things while waiting for the transaction to appear, same as they take care of other things after they grab your card.

The very fact that you stated this only goes to prove my point that we need to switch to a standard denomination.  Because 1BTC = 1000mBTC = 1,000,000uBTC.
Confusion like this (people not knowing what the proper decimal equivalents are) is why we need EVERYONE to switch to the SAME denomination, and then go upward from there, exactly how all of the currencies we are used to work.

I disagree with your definition of investment.  Dictionary.com does too:
3. a thing invested in, as a business, a quantity of shares of stock, etc.
4. something that is invested; sum invested. 
World English Dictionary disagrees as well:
1. 	a. the act of investing money
 	b. the amount invested
 	c. an enterprise, asset, etc, in which money is or can be invested
2. 	a. the act of investing effort, resources, etc
 	b. the amount invested
3. 	economics  the amount by which the stock of capital (plant, machinery, materials, etc) in an enterprise or economy changes
4. 	biology  the outer layer or covering of an organ, part, or organism
5. 	a less common word for investiture
6. 	the act of investing or state of being invested, as with an official robe, a specific quality, etc
7. 	rare  the act of besieging with military forces, works, etc
Cultural dictionary disagrees as well:
The purchase of property with the expectation that its value will increase over time.
The bottom line is, an investment CAN be something that has real world intrinsic value and produces a regular return based on a proven record, but it can also be a lot of other things.  Just because you don't like those other definitions doesn't mean they are wrong.
TL:DR; Bitcoin IS one form of an investment.

I am hopeful it eventually will.  It is already used by blockchain.info to some extent (you can at least see the firstbits on the page of each address).  There is some concern about the lack of a checksum or other device to protect against user entry error.  I really don't think it is a concern myself - you can give someone more firstbits if you're concerned about that.  8 or 9 characters should be plenty to ensure the firstbits will error out rather than point to another person's address in the event of a typo.
@_date: 2013-01-18 16:54:09
I would agree with this.
You pay taxes on the income when it is earned.  You pay taxes on the difference between your income and the sale price when you sell Bitcoins for a gain.
For example, let's say there's a 20% income tax and 25% capital gains tax.  I earn $100 worth of BTC doing a small job for someone else.  I would owe $20 in taxes at this point.  The BTC price jumps up, and suddenly I have $300 worth of BTC.  I decide to sell them.  I would then owe $50 in capital gains taxes (($300 - $100) * .25), for a total of $70 in taxes.

I don't see it complicated at all.  If you're a lender, you should be able to choose which bond you want, and all the bond-issuers should be able to offer their bonds at a rate they believe is competitive.  If you choose the French bond instead of the Greek bond, then the Greek bond should issue their bonds at a higher rate so the next person might choose their bond instead.  There is no need for involvement of a committee.  Let the free market do what it does best!

It's just based on historical performance IIRC.  So the same amount + higher fee may have only happened once or twice.  Maybe those two transactions with higher fees were done at peak transaction processing times, leading to a higher average time to inclusion than the many transactions with a standard fee.  Etc, etc.
Remember it's not just about how much you send and how big of a fee you have, it's also about the size of the transaction and what time of day you are sending it.  Lots of variables can affect the overall time to inclusion.

Paypal provides the solution in this case.

You need to invest $800 in an ASIC miner, not a rig.
An $800 rig will net you 1,200 MH/s, properly set up and everything.  An $800 ASIC will net you 30,000 MH/s.
In a matter of weeks, when ASIC miners from BFL come out in full force, the 1,200 MH/s you'd make from a mining rig won't even pay the electric bill they generate.

Ahhh, I see.  So you're saying that you can skip the validation check on the torrented blocks.
What about doing less validation?  A quick block header check, rather than verifying every transaction?  If you know that block number 240000 has a hash of X, then just recalc each block header from block 0 and make sure it has the right hash?  Shouldn't take too long, I wouldn't think.

I think it wasn't a bubble.  The sellers either panic sold, or sold "high" to try to buy back in low.  Both of those things combined drove the price down far below the value it really should be at, so it is rebounding quickly.

Well, that's the hard part.  If you're in the US, Bitfloor is probably your best option, but it requires that you find a Bank of America and deposit money to their account with special notes attached so they know who it came from.

I'm not sure how in-demand your services might be right now, as I do not believe too many people who use Bitcoins also have a physical shop at this point, but if you're the first one in, it could pose an advantage for you in picking up anyone who does need signs in the future!
I would recommend BitPay.  You can set up pricing in USD that is auto-converted to a BTC price the moment a user generates an invoice.  They've been around a while, and they have 2,400 merchants already signed up with them.

Questions for you...
1) Do you think the typical "wall-streeter" will eventually become familiar with Bitcoin and become interested in investing in it?  Or will they be forever stuck in their old ways?
2) How big of a market cap does Bitcoin need to achieve before wall street views it as something credible and interesting to invest in?
3) What news outlets does wall street typically pay attention to?  Barrons and the WSJ?  But only if the news is interesting to them?
4) Do you really think any wall street investor would actually attempt to pump 'n dump Bitcoin?  Or would they always go after the easier fish to fry (i.e., penny stocks) if they were looking for that sort of unscrupulous activity?

It will recover, certainly.  If Bitcoin was going to die, it would have done so in the 2011 crash.
I find it interesting that the media is treating this crash so much differently than the 2011 crash.  In 2011, the media said "Bitcoin is dead."  Now, the media is saying "Bitcoin exchanges need to be improved because they are failing under the increase load of new people attempting to buy them."

Not really, no.  But, as more people use and demand Bitcoins, the value of them goes up, so it does give incentive for people to "share the word" - especially those who have a large stockpile of them.

I don't think a second wave will happen, for a couple of reasons.
1)  Many of the coins seized by the FBI were customer/seller coins waiting to be used or withdrawn.  These coins cannot be sold by those people who wish to sell them, and it is likely the FBI will sell them via their own auction house rather than signing up with an exchange.  It is also unknown whether Ross kept an encrypted cold wallet with even more customer coins.
2) SR 2.0 and other alternatives are already in place or close to being in place.  Druggies need their drugs, and if they've waiting this long to liquidate, they're not going to liquidate, they're going to check out the alternatives instead.  It's easier and safer than going back to the streets to buy, even though the alternatives do not yet have the rep that SR did.

You're still not getting it.
1) Bitcoin clients will accept whichever chain is the longest as the legitimate blockchain.
2) The difficulty would not increase (significantly) if someone brought 51% online, but mined on a different chain. (I agree with you on this, but what does it have to do with the discussion?)
3) The 51% attacker WOULD (eventually, on average) add blocks faster than all the other miners, since the other miners only have 49%.
For example, let's assume that currently, the network produces a block every 10 minutes (i.e., difficulty is exactly correct for the network hashrate).  Now let's assume that a malicious entity has begun to mine an alternate blockchain (starting off with the current end of the legitimate blockchain, say block  so they do not have far to "catch up") with 104% of the hashpower of the legitimate mining network, and refuses to include any blocks other than their own in their blockchain.
What happens?  Well, at first, both chains will probably remain roughly the same length.  But at some point in time, the malicious chain will edge ahead, since it is able to produce, on average, a block every 9.6 minutes, while the legitimate miners can only produce a block every 10 minutes.  When this happens, every transaction that has been made after block # 210,000 would be reversed as Bitcoin clients around the world recognize the malicious chain (with empty blocks since block 210,000) as the longest chain.

It could certainly use improvement, but most of those are "what if" scenarios that haven't happened yet.
The biggest issue with it is that it CAN be attacked in a variety of ways (mostly related to overloading the system), and that senders and receivers can potentially be linked.  That's still better than the current state of email, IMO.

@_date: 2013-05-02 17:13:30
Well, maybe not.  A lot of payments might be made within Paypal itself, meaning that Paypal doesn't need to actually perform any blockchain transactions.
Paypal made 682 million transactions in Q1 2013.  That's about 87 transactions per second.  If you assume that Bitcoin transactions in the near future might make up 10% of that, then that's 8.7 tx per second.  BUT, you could further assume that 9/10 of those transactions would be Paypal-to-Paypal transactions, meaning that we'd only need 1 tx per second to cover the non-Paypal transactions.
That's not to say that the block size shouldn't be raised beyond 1 MB (I think it should be 10MB at least), but I think it would still be workable as-is for quite a while, even if Paypal jumped onboard.

Dave isn't a moron either - he wouldn't lend at a rate that would not be profitable to him.
Bottom line is, inflation encourages over-investment and too much debt, while deflation encourages under-investment and too little debt (as shown by your little anecdote).  A perfect currency (in my mind) would have neither inflation nor deflation of value.  But, that has, thus far, proven to be impossible to create.
As it is though, in our debt-driven society, I think we could stand for a little deflation to hold us back from spending ourselves into a pit of indebtedness.

@_date: 2013-04-11 22:16:56
It's always good advice.  If you didn't follow it before, start following it now.  People selling at a loss are just doing so out of fear.  So, don't be fearful.  If you don't have extra money you feel comfortable putting into Bitcoin, that's fine (never invest more than you can afford to lose, always diversify, etc).  You can still hold what you do have, and that would be a form of "greed" countering the fear people are showcasing all over the place right now.

Sure, I agree with you.  Bitcoin is still so very young though, and it takes time for new technologies to be adopted in large numbers.  Email and the internet both took decades to fully flesh out before they were truly mainstream ready.  While I don't think Bitcoin will take that long (technology adoption seems to be getting steadily quicker), it will still take time to accomplish, and in the meantime, we have a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.  But that's why it's great to see so many merchants clamoring aboard to accept Bitcoin, despite that they know it is such a small market to sell to.  They are supporting it now to help get over that chicken-and-egg problem, and Bitcoin holders are spending for the same reason.
Regardless, I am serious that I can buy nearly anything I need with Bitcoin (aside from the mortgage payment and utilities), and that was the original question.
@_date: 2013-09-05 15:52:18
This was a very positive video.

"Cryptographically strong, and highly secure."

"Bitcoins can be transferred around the world in an instant, and like cash transactions, can't be electronically reversed."
"They also can't be frozen or confiscated by governments or bank regulators, a protection other currencies don't provide."
Etc, etc.
Sure, they go over the downsides/risks too, but the overall feeling of the video was that Bitcoin is amazing, and has many more positives than negatives.

TONS of doubters, lots of media press stating that Bitcoin is dead, blah blah blah.  I actually came onboard shortly before the rise to $30 (BTC was worth around $1.30 on April 27, 2011 if I remember correctly).
I stuck around for the mining, not for the fundamentals.  At that point, I still hadn't really "gotten it", aside from knowing that I could sell the Bitcoins and put USD in my account.  When it dropped all the way to $2.50, I was considering turning my miners off (they were only barely paying for their own electric usage), but they WERE helping heat my house for free, so I kept at it.  Figured I'd turn them off come summertime.
The price turned around, and I bought 10 BFL FPGA's, subsequently selling them for a premium.  I started to get more into the actual economic side of Bitcoin instead of just the mining aspect, as I don't have much in the way of mining equipment at the moment.  I understand why it is such a fundamental change in the way we can transact now, vs the antiquated banking system.  There is NOTHING that compares to Bitcoin as far as fees, speed, and restrictions go.
So, I would say that I never lost confidence, because I never had confidence (or cared what happened with Bitcoin) before the crash - it was just a way for me to make some money.  Now that we have recovered from that crash, and now that I better understand what makes Bitcoin great, I would most definitely maintain confidence in it no matter what other crashes happen, UNLESS one or more governments deem it illegal - I have a feeling that would relegate Bitcoin to be forever a niche-use currency.

I agree with you - so many variables, and I don't see any way they can feasibly be predicted or have currency supply fluctuate quickly enough to maintain a perfect value.  I think the best that could be done is a purposeful and predetermined monetary supply inflation to match historical growth in GDP, with some sort of stipulation for economic slowdown due to limited resources becoming that much more limited with increased population.  But obviously, this would be an imperfect prediction.
I think your analogy is attempting to say that deflation is better than inflation, and the best we can do for now?  I don't know, strange analogy.

+1, I don't know why anyone is telling you not to use Blockchain.info.


This tells me you are thinking about "the blockchain" not Blockchain.info.  An important distinction: the blockchain is the accounting ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are stored, and Blockchain.info is simply the name of a website.
Where you heard that the blockchain is too large and too slow is in reference to the Bitcoin-QT client, because it downloads the entire blockchain.  Blockchain.info is a "lite" client, because it does not require downloading any of the blockchain.
Confusing, I know.  But take a look at what the internet was like in 1993 and you'll have some idea of why.  Bitcoin has improved vastly in terms of usability over what it was a couple of years ago, and it will continue to improve into the future.
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:53:16
Not to mention, BFL sold the BTC for USD as soon as each sale was completed anyway.
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:30:20
Well, sure, but we're not going to see the same sort of efficiency changes that we saw in previous transactions (CPU--&gt;GPU, GPU--&gt;FPGA, FPGA--&gt;ASIC).  Which means, it'll take a LONG time (years) of selling more efficient ASICs before the prior gen truly costs more to run than it makes in electricity.
As an example, the current BFL 60GH/s I have consumes 275 watts, or 198kwh/month.  At $0.08/kwh, it costs me a whopping $15.84/month to run.  In order for it to be unprofitable to run any longer, difficulty would have to rise to the point that I'm making less than 0.15 BTC per MONTH.  Or 0.005 BTC per day.
To put that in perspective, the Bitcoin network would have to have a total hashrate of 63,711 TH/s in order for me to only make 0.15 BTC/day with this unit.  BFL would have to ship out over 1 million singles for that to happen, or over 100,000 Monarchs (meaning they would have sold $460M worth of mining hardware).  I realize that BFL isn't the only company out there, but they are one of the best bang-for-the-bucks out there, so any other company would have to also sell at least ~$400M of hardware at current prices to achieve the same hashrate.
All in all, it will be a long time before we see current ASICs become truly unprofitable.  One could argue that they will become obsolete before they become unprofitable, because most people won't run them to make pennies a day, which I would agree with. The argument, however, was that by July, with 1 cent a KW/h, you can't mine profitably, which is clearly just not going to be true at all.

That's exactly what he is saying.  He (and most people) don't HAVE a decades worth of income to "play" with.  If they did, they would certainly be more careful.
When all you have to invest is a thousand bucks, it's probably a good idea to be more risky with it instead of trying to make some joke of a "diversified" portfolio out of it.  Sure, Bitcoin might fail miserably and everyone invested in it loses their money, but the potential for huge payoff means that $1000 is better spent sitting in BTC than in some index fund, where - yay - you might have a whole $5k in 20 years!

You can't live your life with trading regrets.  I mined over 300 BTC since April 2011, selling them pretty much as I got them, sometimes for $2 or $3 for a whole batch of them.  No regrets - I did what seemed reasonable and prudent at the time.
I also bought a couple ASIC miners for 450 BTC (now worth more than $40,000).  Hindsight is 20/20, and I couldn't have predicted such a price rise.  Now, I am largely saving the ones I have left and will create permanent savings of Bitcoins.  I may regret that decision, who knows?
Bottom line is, don't beat yourself up about it, because your life will just suck if you do, and it's not a good reason to make your life suck.

You wouldn't really have a basis then.  You would have already deducted your expenditures (electricity, hardware depreciation, etc), so your coins would hold zero basis value until you either declared a mark-to-market type of income, or you sold them, inducing capital gains.  Obviously, if they are stolen before you sell them or declare a mark-to-market, then you haven't declared any income related to mining those coins, and therefore, you are unable to declare any deductions related to the theft/casualty of those coins should they be lost.

Walletbit does subscription billings for Bitcoin.  As far as I know, they are the first and still only Bitcoin company to offer this service.
As far as how it would benefit you?  I don't know that it would at this point.  Almost all businesses accepting Bitcoin are doing it because they believe in the principles of Bitcoin - i.e., they believe that credit card companies shouldn't be making a profit off of something that can be done peer-to-peer and for much lower fees, they believe government shouldn't have control of a currency, etc etc.
That said, it could be very beneficial in the future when Bitcoin is more widely used and you cut out the 3% credit card fees you're being charged.  Or, if you believe in the ideals of Bitcoin, then start accepting it anyway and be one more option for people to spend Bitcoins on.  It's very much a chicken-and-egg thing, so the more chickens and eggs we can get, the more quickly Bitcoin will become mainstream.

As was already said, this has been tried with YouTipIt, and wasn't successful.  Why was the reddit BitcoinTip bot so successful in comparison?
1) No account signup before using.
2) Accepting tips was easy, and don't require signing up for any accounts.
3) People hate signing up for accounts.
4) The donations were VERY visible.
5) The subreddits did not have to approve, authorize, or implement the tipping in any way for it to happen.
So, your universal tipping app needs to be useable without a website implementing it, it needs to be useable without those who want to tip signing up for an account, and it needs to be seen when people use it to tip.
Good luck.  :)

The maximum theoretical ASICMiner market cap should be where ASICMiner acquires 49% of the network hash rate and keeps it there until all BTC are mined.
49% of the remaining Bitcoins is 4,765,409.25.
But, invariably, ASICMiner can't really get THAT close, because too many people would lose faith in Bitcoin if they saw a single entity with that much hashpower and that much potential control over the network.  So, say they cap it at 40%.
3,890,130 BTC.
Expenses must be taken into account.  Every coin out of ASICMiner's pocket is a coin out of the users pockets.  Electricity is 7.7w/GHash.  Those GHash will have to keep increasing to maintain a 49% share of the entire network.  But for electricity, they're currently running 35TH/s, so they're using 270KW of electricity.  Assume their electrical rate is a reasonable $0.08/kwh, and they're spending $15k/month on electricity.  But that's only at 25% of the network rate, so increase that to 40%, and they'd be spending $25k/month on electricity.  Of course, this will go up as they have to keep up with the rest of the Bitcoin network, but could level off at, say, $250k/month (many people expect over 1 PH/s of hashpower on the network in the not-so-distant future).
They also have to buy all the hardware for this hashpower, and rent larger facilities to house it.  Say $10k/month for facilities (with necessary cooling, etc), and $1M for buying 400TH/s of hashpower (I really have no idea on this one).
Now, in 19 years, BTC per block will be less than 1, so this might be a reasonable cutoff point to expect ASICMiner to stop mining.  $260k * 12 * 19 + $1M = $60M in total expenses over the time period (give or take).
In BTC, that's 600,000 BTC (give or take).
So, now we're down to 3,280,130 BTC.
But, investors are also risking their money for a return.  Assume that, in general, they believe there's a 50/50 chance that ASICMiner folds in the near future and their investment is turned worthless.
1,640,065 BTC.
With 400,000 shares then, **I estimate that the top possible share price to be 4.1001625 BTC/share.**  And that's if EVERYTHING goes exactly according to plan and perfectly for ASICMiner from here on out.
Disclaimer:  I own no stock in ASICMiner because I don't like the BTC stock markets and because I would rather invest in my own mining equipment.

Let's see... so, assuming you are correct that "you won't make back the money you'll spend on the electric bill," you'd rather advise people to mine instead of simply buy Bitcoins?
Say I spend $100/month on electricity to make 3 BTC.  3 BTC are worth ~ $55 right now.  Ok, but that $100 could have bought me 5.5 BTC instead.  So if I mine, I get LESS BTC than if I just spent the same money on buying them.
How does this make any sense??

IMO, server-side wallets should exist, but they should be 100% cold wallets.  People can instantly deposit to the cold wallet, but they cannot instantly withdrawal.  All withdrawals must go through an approval queue of some sort that either manually or autonomously authorizes the transaction.  Withdrawals are then processed in batches, either with a single send-many transaction or multiple individual transactions.  Either way, the only thing the cold wallet does is sign off on the transactions, and this is done via some air-space design (a thumbdrive, etc).
It makes sense on so many levels, and I don't know why more services don't implement such practices.

Currently, the max block size of 1 MB only allows the network to grow by 52 GB/year.  If that block size were doubled, then the max growth would be doubled, etc.  Unless the max block size is increased to 10MB+, I still see home users being able to keep up with blockchain growth.  2TB HDD's don't cost all that much anymore, and by the time you ran out of space on one of those, 4TB and up would be cheap too.
Also, when looking at it from a max block size perspective, the blockchain size grows linearly, whereas technology has historically been exponential growth.  We'll eventually get to the place (in 20-30 years) where this much data is as meaningless to a cell phone as 100-page word documents are to a modern PC.
Remember those times when you were looking to free up space on your 500MB HDD by deleting various 500KB - 2MB MS Word docs?  I do.  But that's not something we have to do anymore. Same with the blockchain - right now, it's a big deal because it is a large amount of data relative to what a home user has available.  In 20-30 years, it will be irrelevant, and everyone will be able to utilize the full blockchain without even noticing that they do.

4) ASIC's are a man laden with 0 pounds of goods running 100m.
Who is the fastest?  The man with 0 pounds of goods.  How do you make him faster?  In the previous cases, you remove the goods to make him faster.  Now that he has no extra baggage to remove, it becomes much more difficult to make him faster.  You can train him to increase his speeds by marginal amounts, but those increases will never be like the increases in speed seen by removing the weight of goods from him.
Now, you might argue that a man on wheels could be much faster, but such a possibility is not yet allowed by the laws of the 100m sprint.  That might be compared to quantum computing, which has the potential to make Bitcoin mining much faster, but isn't available for the foreseeable future.  Therefore, the trend of greatly increasing speed has stopped for the foreseeable future in favor of a trend of slowly increasing speed.

Basically, yeah.  It would be a horrendous pain for a retailer to deal with thousands of manufacturers directly on stocking hundreds of thousands of items.  Completely impractical for a retailer with this much inventory from this many manufacturers.

Much less accounting, much less risk of default on payments, etc.

Long term changes in exchange rate will never compensate for negative profitability in the short term.  If I buy a miner now for $1350, then mine 8 BTC with it, I'm still 2 BTC poorer than simply buying $1350 worth of BTC right now.  If the exchange rate goes up to $10,000, I still would have been better off buying 10 BTC instead of buying a miner and mining 8 BTC.
Anyone who is still ordering miners at this point is either doing it because they value the anonymity of mined coins, or they are making a calculated bet that they will mine more BTC than they could buy with the same amount of money today.  They must believe that the difficulty rate growth will be slowing down in the future for this to happen.  Certainly, I believe difficulty growth will slow down at some point, but not until the break-even point of most mining hardware is spread out to at least 6 months.  As it is, even BFL's first-gen ASICs still pay for themselves within 2 months.

Receiving a confirmation email with your password in plaintext isn't necessarily indicative of storing the password in plaintext.  It is only indicative that the server, at least temporarily, held the password in memory in plaintext.
I could write a PHP page that emails you whatever you enter into a textbox without requiring anything be stored anywhere.
I would absolutely expect website operators to keep my passwords hashed (not encrypted), but a plaintext email isn't entirely related to that expectation (though I would prefer that emails weren't sent with my password in them).

So, say LIBOR+x is 2.5%.  I offer a loan unattached to LIBOR at 2.0%.  Why would I find no customers?
Why does the market need more transparency beyond the lenders advertising their lending rates?  If I am a lender, and a competing lender offers loans at 5.0%, then I might offer loans at 4.9% to undercut him.  Or, if I think that I won't cover costs at 4.9%, then I might do 5.0% as well, and let the customer decide which one they'd rather go with.  How would this not be a good thing?  How would this not eventually settle on the fair and proper rates for each loan type?  How would this not accomplish exactly the same thing of "just see what someone paid a few moments ago then ask for the same rate or better"?  Lenders setting their own rates based on their competitors rates would accomplish exactly the same thing.

First step, if the number of tipsters is important, is to contact piuk and ask him to add a new API feature to blockchain.info that would return the count of received transactions to a particular address.  It should be a simple feature to add, and hopefully he is open to doing so.
After that, it is just putting all of these things together into a code snippet that can be copy/pasted into anyone's website.
I might be interested in developing said code snippet, but would require a bounty for it, as I simply don't have enough time to develop things without incentive right now.  Other people who develop professionally could probably do it more quickly and cheaply than I could, but for the sake of throwing a number out there, I'll say that I would do it for $200.

You'll get something beyond 18tkn, since it is already "taken" (my address appears before your address in the blockchain).  Yours might be 18tkng, or 18tkn4.  Or if an address appears in the blockchain with 18tkn4 already, then you might get 18tkn4h.
Hopefully that makes sense.
My full address is 18TKNbSLTrd3a2W8mtoH5uNzFhWRWNcuHU.  Another address that appeared in the blockchain prior to mine already has the same 4-character firstbits of 18tk, so I cannot use that abbreviation, because it will point to their address.  However, I can use 18tkn, 18tknb, 18tknbs, 18tknbsl, etc, and all of them will point to my address.
This might offer up a better explanation:

I tried an Android phone when I was recently up for an upgrade.  Used it for 10 days I think, and just couldn't stand it any longer.  So many things I hated about it that the iPhone does so much better.
That said, I'm not sure I can go another upgrade cycle without being able to spend Bitcoin from my phone, so I might just have to force myself on the android bandwagon if Apple doesn't change their ridiculous policies.

Another comment... Wikipedia says that etoro isn't a broker themselves, but that they use RetailFX, IC Markets, and FX Solutions.  So is one of these brokers picking up Bitcoin?

If we're talking strictly about firstbits though, those are base36 (caps-insensitive).  So, slightly larger chances of a previous address having the full 8 character prefix found on one of these coins, but still quite high.  I guess it'd be a chance of N in 2,821,109,907,456 for each coin, where N is the number of unique addresses used prior to the funding of these coins.

Reconciliations.  You've got to make sure that what your sales system is reporting as income is what is actually showing up in your bank account.  Also, if reddit is keeping the Bitcoins in Bitcoin (and not just immediately cashing them out for another currency), then gains and losses on foreign exchange must be reported, etc.
Bitcoin is honestly an accounting headache, especially since no traditional accounting software is really built to handle it yet.  I can see it causing a lot of additional work for accountants.

Because they're not just vanity, they're firstbits addresses (i.e., if you search on blockchain.info for "1aaaaa", then the address listed will always match with the one I am selling).  And it does take a decent amount of time to pick each one off the offline machine upon which they are stored, properly encrypt them, and send them off to the user.
However, there are a couple of coupon codes in place if you want to try this out.  PHY99 gives a 99% discount off of one item.  PHY50 gives a 50% discount off of an entire cart.  I want to get more people using the service and giving me feedback on it.

Picture it like a locked mailbox with a slot in the top and you have the only key.  People can deposit mail into the mailbox, but only you can remove it, because you're the only one with a key.  If you lose the key, no one can remove mail from it.

We should switch to uBTC and be done with it (forever).  This would give Bitcoin two decimal places, which would be what people are already familiar with, and would be much more compatible with existing financial softwares.  And a uBTC is worth enough that it wouldn't be too cumbersome at this point to use.  Buying something for $25 would be sending 31,250 uBTC.  The conversion is easy too - just remember 1 million.  You multiply or divide by one million to convert between BTC and uBTC.  And finally, it would give enough room for BTC to grow however large and valuable it could possibly grow.  Even if everyone in the world used bitcoin, uBTC + 2 decimal places would be enough to provide all the precision we would need.
Everything about uBTC is excellent.  Let's use it, and not bother with the mBTC middle ground.

Costs will generally follow some margin behind the revenue gained in mining.  Currently, miners make $1,875 per block, and electricity costs an estimated $750 of that.

@_date: 2013-06-15 23:46:15
Very nice!  I programmed the original firstbits site, and am glad to see someone else has picked up on the idea!
A few questions...
- Do you do the firstbits calculation yourself, or are you pulling from the blockchain.info API?
- If you are doing the calculations yourself, can you share the basic logic you are using?  Just so people can verify that it follows the standard firstbits logic.
- How do you handle two addresses with the same firstbits in the same block?  In other words, if no address starting with "1mom" were in the blockchain, but then two appeared in the same block, how do you handle which one gets the "1mom" firstbits, and which one gets the "1momX" firstbits?

Here's the thing though - if you're selling on an exchange, you're not really selling directly to another person.  You're selling to the exchange, who then sells it to the other person.  The language is clear - if a miner sells directly to another person, they need to be registered as a money transmitter, and if a miner goes through a 3rd party, then that 3rd party is an exchanger and a money transmitter.

Sorry, I wasn't agreeing with that part of your assessment, only the part about Hugh Hendry.
I don't think we'll see much of that.  People have been duped by companies and governments too many times recently to buy into yet another scam.  Everyone loves Bitcoin because it's a giant "FU" to government and the powerful people who are in control of our society today.  People feel like voting does nothing, protesting does nothing, and riots won't happen unless we're literally homeless or starving.  But Bitcoin provides a way that we really can take control away from the untouchables, without degrading to a virtual civil war.

If it makes the fee compulsory, there is a reason.  Either the funds you are sending are not old enough, or they are too small, or they include too many inputs, or a combination of all of the above.  If you did not include the "compulsory" fee, miners across the network would not include your transaction, and it could take days or weeks until someone took mercy on you and included your transaction in their block.

I'll say this once again.  It is quite possible he has nowhere near 600,000 Bitcoins left.  The exchange rates were much lower than they are now for the majority of time that SR was open.  This also means that the majority of the Bitcoins earned were earned earlier on.  And, likely, that many of the 600,000 Bitcoins were spent or exchanged for USD earlier on, at the lower exchange rate, as well.

People who want to prioritize their transactions and make sure they get into a block quickly will have to add beefier transaction fees.  Everyone else will begin to see delays at peak periods.
This is why it is under discussion whether the cap should be raised or not.  But, larger blocks mean greater block propagation times, so even if the cap is raised, it is likely that some pools will stick with no or very few 0-conf transactions to avoid orphans.  Ultimately, transaction fees will win out as a requirement.  We're just enjoying a period where we can quickly send fee-free transactions.

Customer orders BFL FPGA for $600.

Competition releases new $1300 miner.
Customer wants to order $1300 miner.
Customer has to decide which company to buy from.
Customer can receive a $600 discount from BFL.
Customer orders from BFL.
BFL takes revenue of $700.
BFL produces ASIC for $100 (est., based on various people's prediction of material costs for chips + PCB).
BFL profits $600.
Please tell me how this does not make business sense.  They gain $600 in profit that they might have otherwise lost to another company if they did not do this.  Plus, it gives them repeat customers.  Plus, their customers like them better for doing it.  It's a win all around for BFL.

1) You do owe taxes on earnings.
2) That income would be considered "gain on foreign exchange", which falls under the capital gains umbrella.
3) A gain on foreign exchange only happens at the time you exchange the foreign currency (Bitcoin) for USD.  You do not have to pay taxes on earnings not yet realized through the action of selling the asset.
4) Short term capital gains (assets held for less than 1 year) are taxed as ordinary income.  Long term capital gains (assets held for more than 1 year) are taxed at capital gains tax rates (0%-15% I believe?).
5) No special procedures for accepting Bitcoins, just be sure to report currency exchange differences as outlined above.
6) COGS should be listed at the value of the Bitcoins at the time of purchase (i.e., USD equivalent cost at time of purchase).

How could users simply "fork the chain"?  Sure, they could hardcode a specific block as the legitimate blockchain up to that point, but why couldn't the government entity simply resume the same attack afterward?  Do you mean an algorithm change?  Ok, possible, but what would stop the governmental agencies from then using supercomputers to compete against the CPU's and GPU's (since ASICs of any kind would no longer be relevant for a while) of the average user?
I would hope that you are correct that users would simply pour more computing power into the network to protect the value of their BTC, but that's not easy or quick to do when ASICs require days to arrive (and that's assuming the manufacturers of them have some in stock ready to ship).  Also, what if the government uses 10x the hashpower necessary to 51%?  So every user would purchase 9x the number of their current ASIC miners just to rescue the Bitcoin network?  Not to mention, the immediate and likely drastic drop in BTC value would mean that those who did have the wealth to buy more ASICs may no longer have the means to do so.
If something like this happened, I see far more people jumping ship than staying onboard.  JMO.

I keep hearing about companies and people who refuse to invest into Bitcoin yet (or accept them for payment) due to the lack of liquidity.  When you're a billion-dollar company, and a payment method only has $750M in TOTAL currency to circulate, it just doesn't give you much of a chance at generating decent sales through it.  It's not worth implementing.
I welcome the speculators and the hoarders, because they'll keep the price going up.  And as the price goes up, the total value of the currency in circulation will go up, which will interest more wealthy investors, and show a higher market cap for companies to go after.
It's a chicken-and-egg problem, for certain, but we aren't going to get the larger companies onboard without a much larger market cap.  Speculation and hoarding is really the only realistic way to get there.

I disagree.  Having big money will most assuredly decrease the volatility from what we are seeing today!
Look at ANYTHING involved with big money.  Oil, corn, currencies, stocks of Fortune 500 companies, etc.  They are all much, much less volatile than Bitcoins have been.
Bitcoin will never be a completely stable value.  The only way something stays completely stable is if a central entity controls it and forces it to remain stable (i.e, government currencies).  We should never expect Bitcoin to compete with regards to stability with these things.  We SHOULD expect Bitcoin to become the new gold standard though, with the ease of moving and transacting with it.

With bitpay, you can choose to keep a percentage as BTC and cash the rest out as USD.  Lots of businesses do this - covering costs with USD, then holding the profits in BTC in hopes of appreciation.

Which means those assumptions on network growth aren't reasonable.  No one is going to continue to mine if it is unprofitable, which means the difficulty can only grow so far.  With FPGAs, we saw difficulty stagnate at the point where it would take 6-8 months to break even on newly purchased mining equipment.

Is there a limit on how much you can put on a bet?  It seems like it'd be quite easy to manipulate the price with enough money and make it a 100% certainty that you would win any bet.  For example, bet $500M that BTC price goes over $300.  Now, minutes before the bet expires, buy up every BTC that you have to to make that bet.  It might cost you $50M, but you're winning $500M, so that's a drop in the bucket.

So if my tax rate was -5%, do I take an extra -0.5% credit off the top?
@_date: 2013-02-22 16:30:26
I would say yes, it does provide more incentive.  If there are more transactions, more people are using it, the price has risen rise, and the network will be more secure.
Theoretically, you only need one computer to mine and the whole Bitcoin network could still work, but it wouldn't be very secure, because someone else with two computers could overtake the blockchain with a 51% attack.  So, increasing the number of miners really just increases the security of the network, not necessarily the ability to process more transactions.
There is talk of increasing the block size limit so that miners can process more transactions, and I imagine this will happen at least a couple more times down the road if and when Bitcoin goes hugely mainstream.

Is this not your service?
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:36:42


It absolutely is.  $1,000 invested in your typical diversified investment strategy garnering 8% interest a year, even over 40 years, is hardly going to make a bit of difference in someone's life.  $500,000 (a typical person's 10 years of income), on the other hand, would make a HUGE difference in someone's life invested at 8% over 40 years, or even in much less time.
So, if you lose that $1,000 on a risky investment?  Oh well, whoopty-do.  You'll earn it back soon enough.  If you win big on your risky investment and have a life-changing amount of wealth and can retire 30 years earlier because of it?  Excellent!
And if you lose that $500,000 on a risky investment?  HOLY ****, you've just lost your future retirement.  If you win big?  Well, now you're extremely wealthy, but you already had a lot to begin with.
So yes, they are completely different investments with completely different goals.  If you lose the $1k, even if that's all the money you have to invest, it's not a big deal.  If you lose the $500k, especially if that's all the money you have to invest, it's a HUGE deal.  Thus, $1,000 is better spent sitting in a riskier investment than $500,000.  I fully support diversification when you have an appropriate amount of money, but it is silly to tell people that they are better off diversifying a tiny amount of money when that just really isn't the case.


But index funds aim for essentially the same result as diversification, do they not?  Regardless, replace my wording of "index fund" with "diversification strategy", and my intended point is still made.


I don't see why this isn't an investment strategy.  It may not be a strategy you agree with, but it is still an investment strategy.

If you want to buy Bitcoins with another currency, there are plenty of exchanges you can utilize.  It depends what country you are in as to which is the best.  MtGox is the largest.  Coinbase allows US persons to connect their bank account directly.  Not sure what is the best on the Euro scene.
Certainly the websites giving you micropayments aren't a legitimate way to gather any usable amount of Bitcoin.  They're more for giving you tiny amounts of coin to experiment with.  Mining used to be more lucrative, but as with anything, when something is lucrative, the market becomes crowded until it isn't.
Earning Bitcoin for gaming advice is a service I haven't heard of happening... maybe you should be the first to offer such a service and see how it goes?  Mass collaboration in problem solving?  Look for questions or projects that have bounties at the bitcoin forum.  There's usually several people willing to offer significant sums of money if someone can program this or answer that.

You've gathered the wrong information then.
Nowhere has BFL stated that they have accepted 17,000 preorders.  If you're going based off the BitPay order  well, that'll be wrong for several reasons, including the fact that order  can be generated without paying for them, and that BFL is only one of 2400 merchants who use BitPay and utilize the same order # chain.
Josh has said in the past that 20,000 chips would be enough to fulfill current preorders, and more recently confirmed that 75,000 would be enough to fulfill current preorders AND stock their warehouse full of ready-to-ship ASICs, even if their yield isn't great (60%).
I'll assume, based on the rate that I've seen various cancellation and new order threads pop up, that they're still at the point that 20,000 chips would fulfill their current preorders.  That's 2,500 SC Singles.
Furthermore, the 5,000-6,000 number is the number of chips they expect to yield from the first 5-6 wafers.  There's 8 chips in each single, so that'd be ~750 singles they can make out of the first batch of chips.  The second 5-6 wafers should be done a week and a half later (again, according to Josh), with the remainder of the 75k chips done at some point in the unknown future.

Yes, you can absolutely send smaller outputs along with bigger ones!  The Bitcoin client won't do this automatically (i.e., without you actually sending money somewhere), but I had a transaction that included many different outputs, some as small as 3 satoshis, and there was no transaction fee.
One thing you could try is just sending a large portion of your wallet (if you have more than 1 BTC) to a new address every day.  It would make your transaction a high priority (and thus fee-free), and hopefully include some of the smaller dust in with it.
Also, look up your wallet addresses on blockchain.info and check out the "unspent outputs" section.  It'll show you how much dust you really have.

I would agree that such a mortgage would be excessive for that income, I was just throwing those numbers out there as an example.
It definitely makes more sense if you're talking about living on 35%.  35% of $40,000 is $14,000, which is very close to the $12,000 "after retirement" income I talked about.  But if you're paying down a mortgage, that cuts into your after-retirement income, meaning you'll need to tack on a few extra years to the plan.
Regardless, the point is made that retirement can happen very early for anyone if they are frugal and learn how to live well below their means.  I think it is an admirable thing to strive for indeed!

8)  Institutional and big money investors.  I was contacted by someone three days ago who was looking to buy 20k coins, and knew I knew someone who had several hundred thousand.  The potential seller declined, but wow.  Add to that the fact that more than 100 people signed up for accounts at Tradehill in just a week (which, btw, requires at least $10k as a depository balance), and I just see lots of people with lots of money adding to the existing economy.
The world is waking up...

We need to switch the default denomination.  This means that your Bitcoin client will show your balance in uBTC, exchanges will exchange uBTC, and stores will price things in uBTC.
Certainly, houses could be denominated in BTC, just the same as we can currently say a house is "$1.2M".  But going up is a lot easier than going down, hence the need to make the default a smaller value.

Yeah, but "cents" = worthless in my mind.  I don't equate cents with anything I want to buy or hold, because it's essentially just change that is hardly worth picking up off the ground.
Also, I've been around BTC since 2011 and have never heard any of those terms you just gave.  Where are those commonly used?  The term I always hear is Bitcent or Bitcents, but I don't much like it.

On the contrary, I think it is awesome that they are legitimizing Bitcoin with terminology such as "funny money".  Because in 99% of the populations' eyes, that's exactly what Bitcoin is.  And when the news says that funny money has entered the real world, then people think, "dang, maybe that Bitcoin stuff that I thought was funny money is actually the real deal."

Credits is so generic and vague, it would take a while for such a word to be immediately associated with BTC.
My thought is that the word representing uBTC would need to be unique to only BTC, just like Bitcoin is.  And it should immediately bring to mind Bitcoins when it is said, so it should be similar/familiar in that way.  Bitmils, or something.

I don't think so.  Other cryptocurrencies cannot do an equal job as Bitcoin right now because no one is using them.  I can't go and pay for a pizza to be delivered to my house using Litecoins.  This first-mover advantage isn't going to change without a good reason, and the minor modifications from the original Bitcoin setup we've seen in alt coins doesn't provide enough of an advantage to initiate such a change.

I'm guessing that stores throw out a lot of stuff that passes expiration dates, but that is still edible.

So, er, what is a Bitcoin?
It’s a “digital currency”. Normal currencies have banknotes, each with a registration number. Imagine that, instead of printing the notes, you just kept a list of the registration numbers of each of the notes and who owned them. People could pay one another by transferring the registration numbers online. That’s how Bitcoins work. A network of computers is keeping track of who owns a pot of 11m of these numbers. It’s the price of putting a number in your Bitcoin account that’s soaring – this week it hit $147, a more than tenfold increase in price since January.
That doesn’t sound revolutionary.
Well, Bitcoin has a few peculiar features. The oddest is that we don’t yet know who actually devised the whole system.
What do you mean?
All that we have is the founder’s pseudonym: “Satoshi Nakamoto”. It’s a Japanese name, but they could be a person or people anywhere in the world. Whoever they were, they mistrusted government enough to set up a private currency and an online bank account system outside its reach.
What’s the monetary policy for this currency?
Rather simple. The network of computers generates a fixed number of new Bitcoins a day. The system also has a cap built into it – so there can never be more than 21m of the registration numbers.
It gets odder. The whole network is anonymised. So while there is a register saying who owns which of the numbers, it is designed to make it extremely difficult to track which real-life person owns what.
Why did someone do this?
They wanted a currency they could use online that was outside government control.
And they don’t trust the conventional banks?
I think that goes without saying these days.
How easy is it to get an account?
It’s a hassle.
And do any major businesses accept them
for payment?
Er, no.
That sounds like quite a significant bug in something calling itself a “currency”.
They are, in that regard, less useful than Air Miles.
So is a Bitcoin account as secure as a bank account?
No. It’s safe from governments – for now – but there have already been several high-profile hacking incidents and thefts from accounts on the network. Savers who lose out aren’t covered by any insurance – and the police can’t trace thefts.
So why exactly did people start to use this service?
Lots of people agree that the government can’t or shouldn’t be trusted with the money supply. Some Bitcoin investors are libertarians who want to support a private central bank. And others worry that expansionary monetary policy – like Japan’s super-loosening this week – will set off hyperinflation.
And they think Bitcoins are valuable precisely because not that many of them can be generated.
Like those “limited edition” plates commemorating royal weddings?
I suspect Bitcoin investors would prefer to think of it as a digital alternative to gold. But the rationale is the same. Less idealistically, there are other people for whom untraceable bank accounts are rather helpful.
Go on . . . 
Bitcoin’s anonymity attracted illegal operations. Its most famous use, until recently, was as the currency in an online narcotics emporium.
So why has its price risen so fast? A rise in the demand for drugs?
Not quite. It looks like the tax on bank deposits in Cyprus spooked some people, who jumped to buy untaxable, unfindable Bitcoins. Then, as the price rose, more people bought in.
People bought because the price was rising?
They expect more rises. It’s a modern tulip mania.
Except without a pretty flower at the end of it.
Or a Kate Middleton plate.
So what does the rise in the price of Bitcoins mean?
In the real world, even when inflated to $1.5bn, the Bitcoin market is tiny. That said, the inflation hawks who bought early can make a killing from the rise in the price. If, that is, they can be persuaded to turn them in for government-backed money. You know, the kind you can buy actual stuff with.
And the drug dealers?
They’re probably pretty happy right now, too.

That'd be an interesting graph, but it certainly shouldn't be the default.  The default of ANY financial chart (stocks, mutual funds, currencies) is always based on the last price.
That said, I think it would be neat to see a 6th option to select up at the top that says "weighted average of all exchanges".  This wouldn't be based on a time period of trade, but rather, the average of the dollar value of the last trade across each of the exchanges.  And this average would be weighted by the volume at each exchange, so that an exchange with miniscule volume wouldn't skew the price out of whack.

I'm not complaining about volatility.  I'm just agreeing with the author that the reality is, it'll be difficult to get merchants to accept Bitcoin (without immediately reselling it for their currency of choice) while Bitcoin is as volatile as it is.

They could easily ban all US businesses from using it though.  It wouldn't get rid of it, but it would certainly limit usefulness for US residents, and would most certainly crash the price.

Amazon coins (in their current form) are glorified gift cards.  You can't send them to anyone else or exchange them back for cash - you can only use them to buy products from Amazon.
Now, if Amazon/Google/etc actually did create their own currency, and it acted as such, then the government could potentially come in and shut them down.  Boom - all your money is gone, vanished, just like that.  It happened to e-Gold, it could happen to anyone else who tries to use a central entity to create and authenticate a currency.  Bitcoin, like torrenting, cannot be shut down by any government, company, or entity.  Amazon/Google could also decide to make their currency completely worthless one day by saying they will no longer accept or redeem it.  Or maybe they go bankrupt - again, *whoosh*, your money is GONE!
As far as why would any regular person even use Bitcoins?  I'll give you a few reasons:
* You can send any amount of money you want incredibly cheaply or free. Much more cheaply than credit cards or Paypal.  When you consider that restaurants or online retailers typically run a 3-4% margin, and 3-4% of their expenses are simply to pay off payment processing fees, this is HUGE. If Bitcoin usage was common-place (and I hope that someday it is), it could DOUBLE their profits!
* There are no limits on the money.  Your money should be your money, to spend how you see fit.  No regulations to tell you you can't send money back to your family in Zimbabwe.  No banks to freeze your funds over "suspicious activities".  No Paypal to freeze your account for 180 days over absolutely nothing.
* Cheaper prices.  Bitcoinstore.com, for instance, sells (most) everything in their store for less than Amazon or Newegg. They can do this because they have cut out the middle-man payment processor!
* No 3rd party seizure.  Unlike the banks and governments around the world, which have seemingly unanimously voted in regulations to steal your money in the event of a bank going bankrupt (as opposed to insuring it, which they tell you they are doing), Bitcoin cannot be seized.  Your money is safe - in your bank account, it might not be.
* No risk of charge-backs for merchants.  Ask any merchants about charge-back fraud, and I'm sure they'll give you an earful.  It is a big unpleasantly of doing business, especially for online retailers.
