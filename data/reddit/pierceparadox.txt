@_date: 2014-02-25 13:52:46
I woke up this morning to learn I lost my only 0.2 BTC in gox. This was all I was able to buy and I sure wish it was on another exchange. I cannot afford to buy more but I will pull through and bitcoin will live to see another day. Maybe one day I can afford another 0.2.
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:17:05
A tipping post where you give out all these mBTC would probably get you much more attention. They have been blowing up recently. That being said. Thanks for giving back!
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:01:05
Keep up the good work and spread the word! Bitcoin is here to stay!
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:40:16

This thread is about THANKING those who tip. We should not take advantage of their generosity. If you get a tip simply provide thanks and spread the word!
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:02:24

What do you think has been the newest positive development in the bitcoin space.
This one is easy for me, TIPPING THREADS. It has attracted so many more people to bitcoin who would not have otherwise. So.. thank you for this thread.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:49:20
Pretend Mtgox employee here. Shit is whack yo.
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:22:17
I will take the 2 pizzas and 100000 btc. That is what you meant right?
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:31:02
Awesome, Did not know you could do that. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:56:02
I have been tipped plenty, Just want to keep the tipping movement going to bitcoin. It is attracting a lot of new users.

Wait for the hipsters to claim they like bitcoin before it was cool to buy in.
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:03:09
If demand will be greater than supply will not the price raise?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:30:05
Yep. Woke up with morning and saw the "crashed price" and simply said to my self, Perfect time to buy some more!
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:10:17

Charles Darwinning the darwin award maybe .  Some don't think that it be like it is, But i do.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:52:50
Wait for the price to double. Higher number always means better.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:58:22
If the price actually drops to $5 don't buy in. Wait to see if it reaches over $200 again.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:58:33

I have recently (less than 3 weeks) bought a house, and Work for one of the largest energy companies in my state as an I.T. analyst. They pay for all education I could want. I can invest in stocks in my company but unfortunately we are in the middle of a lawsuit with the EPA so I don't foresee it doing anything but losing ground anytime soon. I have not considered the precious metals but am definitely going to do my research now!

Absolutely, as long as I am with a team of people I would be happy.  I have not done much with mt life so far (i am 26) and I would be much happier knowing I have helped others rather than only think about myself and have nothing to show for it.

Do it for 3000 bitcoins at 200 rpm, but make sure to advertise your upgrade to 3000 rpm as a DLC. Everyone loves paying for DLC.

yes burning fuel does cost money. Alternators produce electricity from said burning of fuel. But they also produce more electricity than you car needs. I.E. Giant subwoofer systems take ALOT of power but do not cost you more in fuel. My suggestion was to take said 'leftover' electricity not being used and put it to good use. That being said I am removing my post as I have been notified of the rules.
