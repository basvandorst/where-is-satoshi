Do you know how BitPay converts between Fiat and BTC?

GDAX is operated by Coinbase. They are separate: signing up for a Coinbase account does not mean you have a GDAX account.

What the ecosystem needs now is not more infrastructure (i.e.  more chains), but more apps built on top. And that doesn’t require permission.

Usually when something reaches its ATH or some other emotional number, people tend to sell, price goes down then flattens somewhere in between the ATH and low point.

Uh, I sent $13 for a couple cents and it took about an hour.

I don't think anyone would stupid enough to run an illegal drug market in China.

It's kind of like investing in orange juice, orange popsicles, orange concentrate to diversify from investing in oranges.

I don't think the cryptomarket is diversified enough that you can say investing in alt coins lessens risk. Everything seems tethered right now.

So to understand this correctly,
* The Hong Kong and New York agreement was a compromise between those advocating 'big-blocks' and those advocating for Segwit
* Agreement depended on maintaining a single chain which had 2MB blocks AND Segwit enabled. However, Segwit update would occur before 2MB blocks.
* In early August, a fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash occurred which implemented solely-bigger blocks. During the same time, Segwit was being signaled and later enabled.
* Now, since Bitcoin Cash exists, miners are saying they don't have to signal for bigger blocks. Bigger blocks mean more transactions per block; however, reward for block is still constant.

Robinhood is for the mainstream, and they don’t want to manage their own keys.

Two things:
1. Volume of transactions with Bitcoin barely took a hit, signifying that - though people like to say cryptocurrencies are used mainly for illegal drugs - at max, only 5% of total transactions are used for them.
2. Numerous sites on the darknet immediately popped up to fill the void left by the Silk Road, implying that online black markets are here to stay.

Coinbase charges fees for transfers? I thought there was only the network fee.

Go to HN. People there will actually argue about the potential and limitations of Blockchain.

If you're referencing the Alphabay incident, that happened in Thailand.

Yeah.
