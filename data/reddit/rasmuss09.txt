In my opinion Kraken offers best security from all and I never had any problems. O.K. I didn`t test all but I am satisfied.

In principle:
 Your bot must check every ten seconds the price (API).
 Your bot save these prices in a database (DB).
 Your bot calculates values (for example macd-values) to predict if it is a good buying-opportunity or not. (Trading-libraries, DB) 
If it is -&gt; buy bitcoin (API). Make sure only once ;-). Set Flag or so. 
Your bot checks permanently if there is is a sign, that the trend ends (trading-libraries).
If it is -&gt; sell bitcoin (API). Make sure only once -&gt; Flag.

If you use Lov-Grovers-Quantum-Algorithm you are able to half the length of the key of a brute-force-attack.  
Just some thougts..
The length of the key is 160 Bit. 
This means you just need to find the right 80 Bit Key.  80 Bit -&gt; ~11 ASCII-Characters -&gt; upper and lower case and numbers -&gt; 
Possibilities: 52036560683837100000
If your computer generates 2096204400 keys/s -&gt;
You need: 787 years  - am I right?
I think we can sleep easy.

Why not in this manner?
Please tell me.. 
Is it profitable to hack you, because you have a large amount of BTC in your hot-wallet? 
And by the way: What information about you can I get from you - it would be easier to hack you ;-).

Do you want to code the client by yourself or do you want to use an app?

Every exchange I know has an API which you can use to script your own bot. There are also many libraries for chartanalysis that are very helpfull for your purpose (for example  ). Good luck and keep a wary eye on the fees.

Nice, 500  bits for you @_date: 2015-04-18 09:10:43
Choose Electrum, it works very well. This Tutorial describes how to set up
O.K. that was not the question.. but perhaps it still helps. I suppose you want to set up an offline wallet.

The first version of the bitcoin core is written in c++, so I think the little hook at the end of the graph is caused by the rise of bitcoin. ;-).
