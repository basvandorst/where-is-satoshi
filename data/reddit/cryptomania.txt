I'm so glad that so many more people see Rodger for what he really is. More and more people are standing up to him, he is finally losing his ground. Him and Bitmain cooked a big buble, which will have to burst sooner or later.

So looks like that they will potentially kill BCH, and they don't seem to have a choice, since their Asics are dropping in price drastically plus more competition coming out? Am I getting it correctly?
@_date: 2018-09-15 18:47:01
Well said, we need bad actors to test our weaknesses once in a while, so we know what we need to work on to become better!
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:37:07
So following your logic, why no switch to something superior to both of these coins/protocols? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:39:31
The reason I left r/BTC. They poluted it with mindless shilsters...
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:46:24
They do have good arguments. However, if they are looking for the best coin/protocol, well, there are better coins out there. Superior to both BTC/BCH, who don't they choose that path is what I don't get. They have to shil BCH and trash BTC... Payed mindless shilsters...
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:02:53
True, there is no saint coin or team out there. I do agree that the big block solution helped in the short term. Chances are BTC won't be the prefered payment method, a speculative asset, maybe a store of value if it stabilizes. Much better protocols has been in development. Not sure why everyone is stuck on BTC vs BTC.

How was your user experience? Which platform did you use?

C'mon, don't take Satoshi's white paper as a god sent plan that must be followed. It was wreaten in 2008-2009, and it was groundbreaking then, but not anymore. I am sure if Satoshi would still be around he would update his vision and come up with a DIFFERENT ideas...Satoshi did his job, he proofed the concept and left. He couldn't have done anything better that that.
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:34:01
In addition he paid to an army of shilsters who would compare and trash BTC every day. They can't even bring valid points to support them. Just personal attacks. 
@_date: 2019-11-28 02:15:58
This would be the educated guess. He might have been Satoshi... But It doesn't matter, the second smartest thing Satoshi did is disappearing.

Judge by the market cap. It's clear who the daddy is. There are some genuine projects thought, but 99% are just copy cats.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:17:27
Wrong question.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:23:45
Which? Where is only 1, BTC.
@_date: 2019-11-07 20:52:47
They are starting to get it. Watch that Libra Congress hearing.

@_date: 2019-11-22 21:26:18
Who knows satoshi's address?

Panic is panic. It will affect all markets.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:22:16
Official bitcoin app? Is there one? Are you talking about bitcoin.com?
@_date: 2019-04-19 22:37:15
Yeah that's the biggest error you can make. I often see that sellers propose alternative platforms and escrows - big red flag.
@_date: 2019-12-12 19:53:16
Lots of people heard of BTC by now, but very few understand what it really is.

@_date: 2019-04-20 02:01:55
Mind expanding on you opinion?
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:01:29
Oh boy, here is some volatility!
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:07:21
When ever I see a title comparing Bcash with the king, I skeep. Always meaningless old points are there, nothing new...
@_date: 2019-09-11 13:54:18
Wow, ok, time to take crypto into peoples hands. Why the fuk do you need a third party to donate crypto... This is just against the core belief of crypto...
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:53:03
Done. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:25:50
Not sure why you would bring up apocalyptic scenarios. Exchanges/wallets and internet itself ain't going anywhere...
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:56:57
Loool, love all those failed crypto memes!
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:40:10
Oh this is just beautiful! We need these moments to weed out the bad, and the ugly.

People think that the guy spent millions of dollars on 2 pizza, he didn't. BTC was dirt cheap, so tha pizzas costed him what it should have. Guy's fkin legend. First to use BTC legitimately.
