All the coins you can buy or sell on my market of choice, Binance. Sure, I have to trade in BTC if I go get something off of Kucoin or Bitgrail, but I would much rather use Binance.
You can go ahead and measure against BTC if you wish, but pretty much anything can outperform BTC. Question to me is it better for me to have my money in ETH or an alt that is gaining faster than ETH cause we pretty much know where BTC has been recently (lucky to top at 17K, but really 15K). Maybe that will change, but it has been the status quo since it hit 20k before Christmas. I believe that IS working off what is happening at the moment actually.

You guys funnel everything into a BCH debate even when the topic was on ETH and BCH isn't even mentioned. I have no idea why the guy replied to my point on ETH with a BCH argument, but you all ran with it. Take a break from the war

Partly because you wrote yet another thesis on BCH at the first opportunity.

I currently ignore BTC and compare alts against ETH. Maybe that will change, maybe it wont. Right now ETH is a better measure of the strength of an alt coin.

They don't use ffffffftcoin either. Probably because ffffffftcoin doesn't exist.

They sell Nike and Coca Cola via advertisements, not the news. Only thing they would ever get out of this kind of thing is "War between the Bitcoins - Drama on the Internet - Who Will Be the Victor".

He gets 1 million of bitcoin at the start of the day and by the end of the day it is worth 10 million if this keeps going.

He doesn't want an alternative to fiat that isn't a precious metal as he is invested in that. Funny that his Gold/Silver website sells it for Bitcoin. He sees the problems with currencies around the world, but made the bet on metal. Taking a quick look at gold/silver/platinum over the last 5 years and I can see why he is so upset. Maybe one day when he sells out enough metal for crypto he will change his tune.

I don't know him at all. Like everyone else, my exposure is only his talks and his books, but where and when he and his family is from strikes me as a big motivator as well as answering your question about grudges. I also think that people may be disappointed in his "defense of bitcoin" on CNBC. He strikes me as someone who is preaching about distributed ledgers, open source and free and fair markets. His mentions of Bitcoin seem referenced more due it being so well known. Again, I do not know him at all and he could of course speak for himself and say that I have no idea what I am talking about, but my take is that he would have free and fair markets decide what coin dominates as long as in the end we move trust away from centralized institutions. Again, just my take.

2FA on email as well if you guys are not using it. If your answer is that your email service does not have 2FA...well you know the answer.

They hate anything they do not understand and they very much do not understand tech. They hate the IRS, they hate the Fed, they hate banks, credit agencies and on and on and on, but give them the option between 100 dollars and 1 Bitcoin and I expect the majority of them would take the 100 dollars because they think they understand it and can hold onto it.

Your words mean everything I think they mean so ty for agreeing.

Way bigger leap than I was ready to take with other families money. I bought three "The Internet of Money" books. Figured it was a good idea for them to get the core concepts down before they spent anything.

You face a hole in the ground. It appears to be a rabbit hole. What would you like to do?
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:31:43
Maybe because GDAX is tied to Coinbase which currently is front-running the sign-ups. Just a guess though.
