Being in the neighborhood for a time, I’ve made one friend who is a classic futures trader. After I showed him my wallets and talked about the technology and showed him the investment value, he was blown away. 
The problem here is that three or four major banks operate in what can easily be called a monopoly. I’m no expert, but I’m sure they’re AT LEAST partly government owned. And that means few if any options for people here to buy bitcoin (rarely a traditional broker offers services which are unconvincing). Basically because bitcoin offers a level of freedom without big brothers involvement in daily life. I’m not native but I’ve been here a bit, please correct me if I’m assuming too much

Wow thank you for this. I kept seeing reference to another website with as much info but I never knew how to read it...

It’s a bit long but perfect for r/LiveStreamFails

Also, while I'm here. I have my first wallet set up as an offline wallet I made with Armory. I uploaded a watch only version to my online computer that's running the blockchain. I've sent and received just fine from it. This is a noob question, but can I delete the wallet from my offline computer? And if so, does that make it a little bit more secure?

Great idea.. I’m still learning so I have a little longer to decide if I want to bail or not. But it could be a sticky situation with GDAX too..

Who made coinbase king?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:29:13
Noob reporting. Who’s this guy?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:56:08
I learned after I was boned buying direct from coinbase. Before I knew better

It definitely wasn’t user friendly, but with bitcoin still in its infancy, I’m glad there are lots of options. I’ll look into this! Thank you!

Wow. Thick as thieves wouldn’t begin to describe that. Holy shit

See this is where I’m confused. So they will be in my paper wallet? Ok, but once they are there, I would then need to get them onto a wallet that supports the new fork? Or will they also release like a SegWit2x Core you could use as a wallet?

Before I knew better, I was wondering how coinbase could compete with GDAX based on the huge difference in fees. Little did I know... I’m still no expert, but I think the big problem is connecting buyers and sellers without a facilitator (exchanges online or physical) wanting a piece of the action.

I listen a lot to the Joe Rogan Podcast, and recently to the ones with Andreas Antonopoulos. I learned a lot from him, but really liked his acknowledgment of its applicability in 3rd world countries as a way to transfer funds without the corruption that physical cash brings. But what I haven't quite figured out yet is how to get the coins without crazy fees! Thank you for the tip!

I don't have any credit cards but I did figure out that I can link my bank to coinbase, though it does take longer

Thank you! I talk about it a lot with my wife. We both know not to fret now since it isn't something we will touch short term. For now its time to watch that price go!

I signed up for a GDAX account in my wake of searching. I checked into it further and stumbled upon your suggestion. I think this should help a lot!
