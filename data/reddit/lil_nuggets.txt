If you plan on trading Alts, buy eth or ltc and then transfer it to an exchange. Must faster and cost about ~30 cents

From what I understand. Hammering out the finer details has been a shit show.

Not sure why this aggravates people. Robinhood has always marketed itself as an investing app, not a wallet app.

You can trade it no? Or are you saying nationwide? I’ve been able to send and receive for a long time on that app

All of this stuff is exciting because it is the only way bitcoin could become mainstream. Once it becomes mainstream then it will be able to become what it was meant to be. But to think that bitcoin would never have been touched by banks or regulators and still go mainstream is a stretch.

To a lot of people it would be yes.

The more mainstream it gets the more likely it will become what you want. If it never becomes mainstream it will never be what you want. This is just a necessary step. Chill out

It’s not suspicious if that’s how the law works

Depends on what chart. I see at least ten exchanges that have it over 9K
@_date: 2018-12-05 00:19:16
Honestly this just makes me think I should buy more.

It’s an interesting monetary theory. For whatever reason you can increase the money supply by trillions and have almost no noticeable increase in inflation.
