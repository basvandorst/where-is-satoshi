Unfortunately, they don't accept international cards anymore.

I real world trade on video games. I am from a country in the middle east (not specifying which) and so I have no access to paypal. The second most popular approach is Bitcoin, so I just used that instead. I don't know what wallets are to begin with, my friends just recommended Circle to me and I put in my information. One thing I'm sure of is that I'm not 'playing the victim' here, I AM the victim. I can't even name you another wallet off the back of the head if my life depended on it. I don't know anything in Bitcoin, truthfully speaking. So what do you mean by "moving to a Bitcoin wallet..."?

Alright, will do. Customer support seemed promising, they seemed to be okay with that idea considering my situation. I will gild every one in this conversation who helped me thus far if everything goes well. :)

Their only options to me are to withdraw to a US/UK bank account or through credit/debit card. I cannot do that as I do not live in the US or the UK or have access to any of those. I cannot take my coins and use a different service because they have blocked sending/receiving bitcoins on my account, and so I am forced to do nothing but withdraw when I cannot as stated earlier in this message.

What's a bitcoin withdrawal?

*UPDATE* 
I got my account re-enabled! Thank you everyone for your suggestions/help! Turns out, I was trying to buy a CS:GO knife from a blacklisted account so I seemed a bad person. OP shall deliver and gild you great knights soon!

So I shouldn't be concerned of losing my Bitcoin if within 2 weeks I cannot get any bank account. Correct?

Perhaps, but as for the time being they think I have been using the money illegally whereas I have not. Do you think I could suggest them to allow me to move my Bitcoin to another wallet rather than withdraw it? 
If that's not a valid answer, I could possibly ask a friend who's studying there in university to withdraw it for me. Would he be questioned if he were to claim it and get taxed on it?
