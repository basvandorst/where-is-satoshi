I know, but what this guy's saying is that it would have taken him no time at all. He would have grabbed that clue in a second and have it all connected by the end of the week. I was just calling that bullshit. 
Like you say, all this shit is possible, but it's gonna take a while. For all we know, it could have all been recent developments as the NSA received more funding and incentive to begin running these searches. Let's not forget that interdepartmental work within a federal environment is gonna take time, anyway.

"Your problem has been taken care of....rest easy though, because he won't be blackmailing anyone again. Ever."
Who the fuck speaks like that? Especially because he apparently sent a photo along with it.

Since when did saying/asking something about something illegal (silkroad) or posting a job ad online become probable cause to access the data of the websites they sucked all this information from? What am I missing here?

Dude, you must have some kind of sixth sense, crazy puzzle mind to have figured it all out from his idealism and circumstantial bullshit. There are loads of people with crazy shit on their profiles. I know it connects, but it's not something you'd just unravel if you pull it. It required some serious effort.
