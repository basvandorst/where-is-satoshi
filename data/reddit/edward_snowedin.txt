"how many times should i write my stupid website name on this post"
the answer is 27 times. 
@_date: 2016-04-16 05:33:19
ah ok well i guess then it makes sense then that both paypal and banks ask for personal information already
@_date: 2016-04-16 05:22:13
remember that time when people were using banks and paypal to avoid paying taxes, selling drugs, soliciting hits, and buying cp? 
maybe this is a bitcoin use problem
@_date: 2016-04-08 00:55:33
currency of the future ! it's great that it relies on the kindness of third parties 
@_date: 2016-04-16 05:39:03
i don't understand what point you are trying to make. are you saying bitcoin isn't used for drugs/murder4hire/cp/randomware ?
@_date: 2014-09-14 03:04:54
how about get a real job you lazy ~20yr old
@_date: 2014-05-09 12:46:15
now if only their api notifications weren't based around security through obscurity
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:00:53
you mean, don't try and signup for an account with TOR, right Tom? signup and spending are two different things, yes?
@_date: 2014-06-15 03:49:55
your post is the equivalent of an overweight person asking how to lock their fucking refrigerator so they don't overeat.
@_date: 2014-09-05 13:26:22
this is why companies never want to give out hard dates for anything - whiny bitches; if they had of said September 2015 this wouldn't have been posted. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:37:57
yes that is what he is saying. dont you see why this is such a great idea ?
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:32:34
why would i buy something from amazon using gift cards paid with bitcoins that i paid for with cash when i can just buy something with cash from amazon
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:34:15
"hey can you guys message my server host for me so i can pay them in bitcoin thanks" 
@_date: 2014-06-15 06:10:28
if a tl;dr was done for your post it would read: ""
you didn't actually say anything
@_date: 2014-06-15 03:05:53
this subreddit has become an absolute joke if this is the type of content being upvoted
@_date: 2014-06-15 03:46:40
no, bitcoin is not the topic here. the main conversation is about how OP can't control himself when it comes to spending money. this post would be better suited in @_date: 2014-06-17 01:45:04
You have a bug on your site.
Registering with a "+" sign ie: andrienjoll+satoshi causes a loop of captcha failures
@_date: 2014-09-12 15:16:39
yeah! ill take my 3$ a month shared hosting account somewhere else! that will show them! 
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:10:59
so if i can summarize - this is you holding a business accountable for a deadline they did not meet. is that correct? sounds very noble of you.
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:16:03
"fuck the government, we don't need em!"
"hell yeah good job feds for arresting those scammers!"
@_date: 2014-07-11 12:01:24
fighting the good fight i see
@_date: 2014-05-29 12:04:49
you should know, you posted the article
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:15:59
is everyone in this thread taking crazy pills? he said CREDITS. meaning, you don't get to take the BITCOINS and move them back to your WALLET
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:57:27
yeah, at least we got another bag holder
@_date: 2014-06-11 11:45:33
you are tits crazy
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:56:34
tom, what are we talking about here? namecheap not allowing tor users to signup, namecheap accepting bitcoin as payment, or the crazy fucking shit you are now talking about regarding leaking documents safely?
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:14:51
I found it. It's cloudbet.
@_date: 2015-05-14 01:46:40
How many neckbeard pesos you own?
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:30:12
So it's just coincidence then that all the emails used to signup at cloudbet got this phishing email ? 
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:44:01
if anyone here thinks a canary clause somehow provides some sort of mythical protection from government agencies, you are dead wrong. business owners don't like going to jail over principals.
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:36:22
I got one of these so I am wondering if someone got their email database compromised 
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:18:28
someone will just write new software
@_date: 2016-03-15 20:32:07
Ah down with the government and filthy fiat until you decide you'd like to use the court system for monetary gain am i right 
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:07:21
i dont know why this isnt a big deal to anyone else. this is huge. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:20:23
you don't see why six people controlling "the future of digital money" is a problem?
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:53:27
yeah, it still will always have a purpose for drugs and cp
@_date: 2016-03-16 04:48:23
If anyone is looking to do any other mundane work for penny shavings I've got some things that need to get done
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:28:47
if you take your internet money off the internet
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:42:29
are you saying nobody would act against their own personal self interests?
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:50:16
it's mind boggling that you would think reddit admins would remove a moderator of a sub because you disagree with how he runs it. they will tell you to find a new sub, which is funny, because theymos has also already told r/bitcoin to find a new sub
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:13:44
i don't try and attempt to guess what 6 people, who hold the entire bitcoin 'ecosystem' on their shoulders, will or will not do. 
bitcoin is all about being your own bank, of course that's until the 6 miners decide to blacklist your coins and you can't spend anything. but they wouldn't do that, right? because rational self interests?
@_date: 2016-01-21 07:09:53
I'm sure glad my chase account doesn't lose value based on one mans blog post 
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:53:08
did you want to share your opinion the part about BitCoin being controlled by 6 chinese miners? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:56:59
i think you mean "i don't agree with his position(s)"
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:43:51
remember when your bank said they'd send your electric bill payment on time, but only if you paid more than everyone else to do so? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:18:47
r/bitcoin, a heavy libertarian, fuck-all-authority community, wants the reddit admins to step in and remove a moderator because they don't like the way he is running the subreddit. that sounds very anti-bitCoin
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:54:13
ah 100$, well thats good then. will you be realizing those gains then or continuing to hold?
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:33:22
that's not fair, "1btc=1btc" is what one of your btc fellows said to me last crash. you're just vomiting up his same argument, this crash.
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:15:24
we've got all your bitcoin related news covered at when you lose it all
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:27:01

Currency of the future, can store money in your head
@_date: 2016-02-26 14:13:56
especially if stupid enough to hope bitcoin will solve your financial problems
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:22:54
I think this is a great example of why people shouldn't be their own bank.
@_date: 2015-09-16 15:31:55
uhm what? do you really think the internet is just xvideos and world of warcraft? did you forget about not having to walk into a library to learn something in an encyclopedia written 5 years prior? 
@_date: 2015-09-22 15:34:54
we got an ideas guy over here!!!
@_date: 2016-05-16 14:09:26
someone remind me what almost anything is please?
1. is not illegal
2. does not involve gambling
3. does not require me to buy a fraudulent gift card to buy
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:33:15
To use a bitcoin ATM you must also buy Bitcoin at 20% markup. No fees though !!! Currency of the future 
@_date: 2015-10-24 18:02:48
It's mind blowing that you believe this
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:27:13
it seems bitcoiners, more than any other sub i visit, love to come up with stories that have no factual evidence at all.
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:14:42
Hi guys,
I got this to the e-mail address I used when signing up for an account at cloudbet (it was unique). Did you guys happen to sign up for this website as well at some point?
