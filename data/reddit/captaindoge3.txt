Both will end up as fox probably, sooner even.
@_date: 2015-01-20 06:00:20
Oh my god not the children *captaindoge sarcastically says*, think about drugs, weapons and let forget, illegal pornos.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:13:29
Simple answer, bring the 4chan and 8chan fags and does them and Dix and swat and send fake pizza orders, funny as fuck
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:10:31
Fuck all government and media and clueless bitches who never look up shit before giving an opinion.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:17:28
I agree with you on that one.
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:21:05
No, they don't want us to stray from fiat.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:19:06
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS CONVINCE OUR CORRUPT AS FUCK GOVERNMENT THAT IT GETS BILLIONS OF RUPEES WITHIN SECONDS. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:49:17
One can, but not in the way mtgox did it
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:17:30
Mtgox was an inside job
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:45:56
There is enough altcoins out there already. Fuck off.
@_date: 2015-01-29 06:01:07
Totally making the next biggest mafia now
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:13:53
Of course, cuz it's the fucking chewbacca defense. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:33:07
What's this whole Ross karpeles debate about, been inactive for a while and back in now
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:27:26
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:08:40
I will break, for free, LET THE PENTESTING BEGIN.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:54:32
Sort of, anonymity is for darkcoin
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:12:13
Also because of its involvement with Silk Road and dark markets
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:22:34
For any crypto currency $20 is fucking ridiculous start price
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:22:27
The startup to startups, that's the answer.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:23:08
Karpeles is DPR *gasp*
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:16:23
Aka idiots 90%of the time.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:33:31
Oh god not 2014 again
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:20:27
Doge is okay, it's just for,some shibes just HAVE to tip. Not all shibes suck
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:29:25
And yet you people hate dogecoin and still say to the moon. Lol. Anyways, TOOOOOOOOOOO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:32:48
You are a troll and nothing else get the fuck out. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:50:27
Legal license bullshit, it won't really do much, regulations on BTC is very hard. It doesn't do anything. Why worry?
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:45:53
He'll ban i2p then also if he wants to watch all of us, if he knows what it is. Thank god i2p is not mainstream. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:12:12
xpy had seemed to good to be true when i saw it, glad im not in, that must have sucked, being led in to that fags scam
@_date: 2015-01-29 05:48:57
Same here, plus it's profitable, so if not helping is good enough, money is there to. Either way you get benefits 
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:37:35
More please this is fucking hilarious 😄
@_date: 2015-01-31 04:13:14
I don't think you get it, that is fucking insanely hard to do just on paperwork, the rest is even worse. Reddit isn't getting as many views and shit, primarily just like every pre 2013 sites and trends, dropped activity by a million percent. That's also why they don't do it, what return and profit comes out, none. Reddit store already done. Like etsy for social media. Be thankful at least that is there cuz reddit can't do everything.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:00:32
Centralized systems cannot be decentralized, whereas decentralized can be centralized, US banks go decentralized, economic failures to epic proportions. Coinbase goes centralized partially, everyone's ok.
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:15:36
The real jurors should be us, the people who aren't fucking dumbasses.

ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED 
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:05:22
If btc were a ponzi then it would have been gone quite a while ago
@_date: 2015-03-03 15:03:13
Darkcoin for one is unique
@_date: 2015-03-03 14:56:59
These companies know something we don't clearly because if companies like fidelity are in this, with huge bank ties they have, there is clearly something large we don't know. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 19:21:42
@_date: 2015-03-01 04:00:40
I don't think it matters as long as your in Thailand. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:07:32
They said this cause they knew it would succeed. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 04:07:46
Linux can with the help of WINE(Wine Is Not an Emulator)
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:52:39
Also the only religion to not say " everyone's wrong believe in us believe in us".
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:57:24
The helmet don't matter, if you ride motorcycle in Thailand you die anyways. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 04:09:38
Then VIVA LA RESISTANCE 
@_date: 2015-03-03 15:02:43
Not doge
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:22:14
Too many altcoins confuses people. Maybe we could use long forgotten ltc
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:53:28
In places like Thailand it really won't help you. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:30:30
Just like it's going to kill itself like God did, through an inside job.
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:32:42
Stupid fucking politicians and their bullshit. It's the future of money, or at least a major influence. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 05:53:15
It isn't, but Feds won't find shit unless they try hard, this isn't fiat were looking at a transaction number is all it takes. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:31:41
They're there already, just need to be improved.
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:45:14
It's when Feds warn you know it's powerful. When it's powerful they'll take it down even if it kills them. What you do is not let them lose or win and just make stalemate and torture them with never learning/gaining/losing anything. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:30:18
I don't give a shit about any system atm. Why the fuck does it matter. BTC won't be big anyways due to Feds. They always crush everything. The answer is defiance and resistance. To help our growth we need to take down all the Feds bullshit. It is the only way. They fuck everything. In fact it not just their fault, it's bankers, politicians, and economists. Let's fucking prove them wrong. Let's prevent them from shoving their bullshit down our throats. It's not a flawed system at the moment which is the major problem, it's authority. They've gone to far, spying,stealing,lying. We need to shut them the fuck up and take them down. That's the solution. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:48:51
It's a big project and people need to be patient.
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:10:46
What your saying is, the Feds are smart and so are bankers, so all the smart people are essentially the problem. So your saying, we need no smart people. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:12:13
They are the government, WHY IN HELL WOULD THEY DO THAT. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:51:58
Thanks man, really appreciate it
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:08:06
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:35:04
Sorry I'm doing a lot so I forgot. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:42:09
Respect your elders son, well bitch my elders are fucking idiots, what now. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:55:56
No no no, let's dox and swat him and THEN send the hookers. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:41:16
They understand it don't you see. They're desperate. Now we leverage it and get what we want or bring them to their knees, simple. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:16:55
I know how you feel. I had this asshole who thought he could learn coding in an hour.
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:18:47
Who needs shit laws like that, anyone can bypass them. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:52:32
1337 !s th3 n3w sh!t.
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:37:29
Without anonymity anonymous markets cannot work.
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:13:37
It won't develop
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:32:23
Pretty much
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:02:54
Don't listen to Feds on anything, they feed you shit. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:06:05
Or darkcoin, full decentralization is the only way to go. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:16:12
Doge community is also the community with the least amount of scams. Every scam gets crushed five seconds after its created. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:07:53
In this case monerro or darkcoin might be a couple options in case that shit fails. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:31:58
Thank you
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:38:50
And we see how desperate they are. Let's bring them to their fucking knees no mercy. Let's see how they feel. No power no money no weapons. Beg motherfuckers beg because this only the beginning. More will come. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:04:51
Ignore the feds and use btc, even if it hurts the children. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:19:20
Take an inflationary altcoin to solve the problem. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:06:21
Doge isn't bad when you look at the price and market cap. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:45:57
Finally, someone like me. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:33:18
Do ANY politicians understand, no. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:19:17
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:25:57
Everything 
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:54:07
I have classmates who think they can learn hacking in an hour. They really think that. At this day and age that's the fucking best you get. I'd count it as technologically literate.
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:23:23
Take a lower priced altcoin which is inflationary. If you need lower value and less competitive crypto, that could be maybe ltc, doge, or drk. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:34:45
I forget is this the shit gov crypto? 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:49:17
Run away from US and strict fucking laws, run from hypocrisy, run from the idiots who control our world. They're smart as US regulations only apply on the US, nowhere else. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:10:19
This is the government, not some nice guy making an altcoin in his basement. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:23:34
Then theoretically you need a different system won't you.
