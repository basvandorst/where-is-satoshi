At least bitcoin doesn't close your account if you're not 18...... Almost lost all my funds before PayPal locked me out. Luckily I got everything our before they found out. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 19:02:38
CONGRATS GUYS, YOU BROUGHT UP REDDIT UP TO 120%
LIKE A BO^S^S^S^S^S
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:59:02
People are so ignorant.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:59:07

@_date: 2014-01-31 03:03:28
i'd like to think so.
i mean you gotta get creative nowadays.
@_date: 2014-06-01 22:40:27
I will disable ad block on websites I see fit worth money. YouTube is unusable to me without it on.
However I have no issues with Reddit and keep it off always. 
I love adblock
Adblock is love
Adblock is life
@_date: 2014-01-01 07:55:02

@_date: 2014-01-31 02:29:23

@_date: 2014-05-31 18:44:27
Such hostility. Much unhappiness.

I wanted my 10$ :/
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:32:05

Lol, hope the don't find out cuz no way in fuck am I doing that. Rather ridiculous, but before I would even think of upgrading I need proof of concept that this is actually going to work well on Minecraft where the average age is like.... 12
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:28:57
Oh no.
Time to flee.

@_date: 2014-02-03 14:05:08
just realised that my QR is messed up. sending it not to me. at all. i'm not sure who has that adress hahaha.
the struggle though is getting the QR to fit in the frame as google requires a 250X250 pixel resolution and these QR codes....well they aren't
EDIT: just realized your comment was satire. Tired as fuck. can't really process things that well. i don't even.
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:50:58
oh i just figure out i did use the correct code. this code is for my multibit wallet. i have since synced em. i thought i was using my blockchain system but i guess i messed up. 
good advice i sharpened it up a bit using another system that can blow up the QR codes and is specifically designed for use with BTC keys.
i'd like to see this catch on though seeing as bitcointip won't be implemented anytime soon for YT.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:59:34
guys, i logged onto mine and i still had mine too!
3 confirmed sources?

You give me 1 dolla and goat and we have deal.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:14:54
What's the point of having these private keys?
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:44:20
they are out of bitcoins?
i think.
"The Reddit Bitcoin Faucet is out of bitcoins until someone donates more"
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:27:04
i would if i had some in my account friend.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:29:38

@_date: 2013-12-24 17:30:44
I AM SO DONE WITH MY MOBILE DICTIONARY
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:46:44
So wait. I should not be giving my account address thing to others?
To check to see if my wallet works?
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:57:34
