It'd only be morbid if the judge was working for the same organization that controlled the group that was currently under trial.  That'd be a conflict of interest.

They're always a threat, they're just better at concealing it.

What's stopping that now?

If only we knew who paid the judge's salary...

I'm pretty new to this sub and actually learning about Bitcoin, when you're saying 400k 18k etc, are you talking exclusively about addresses or are you talking about amounts of bitcoins? It was just kinda hard for me to follow.

And what if they change their mind?

Rooftops.  All I'll say.

There's another way.  Iron and blood.

You're subject to your bodily needs are you not?  And you're only able to supply what the island presents to you and what you can do with said things.

Does maintaining a standard of living through choice and labor really have nothing to do with the laws of economics?  This is a thought experiment dealing with individual choice and labor in order to enrich one's self (assuming one is aiming to survive).  Sure, there aren't markets or interpersonal exchange, but value is still very much a factor.  For example, finding a source of clean water or a tree that bears edible fruit, those would be very highly valued in a survival situation by someone wishing to survive.

What inherent value do any of these goods haven't?  You can readily exchange dollars for other goods, why isn't that considered value. I don't understand why something has to be able to be used to make something (which doesn't most gold go towards decorative, not functional uses?) or be consumable to have value unto itself. 
All value is fundamentally subjective preference, and the price of anything is there agreement between two people who value some given thing differently.

Even if you're all by yourself you're still subject to the laws of economics​, you just don't have the option to trade when people. I don't many people could find any practical use for gold on a desert island, even if it exists it's be much less useful to make tools than say iron, so I would think anybody who knows how soft gold is would ignore it entirely. 
How do you know cash offers nothing in that? Surely it would at least help in getting a fire going.

That we are!  And with that pretty much cleared up, I'm off to class, have a good day!
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:11:22
Gold also has no intrinsic value. It's value is subjective.

Somewhat.  Wouldn't at all consider myself an expert by any means, but probably more knowledgeable than the average person.  A few college classes, some extra curricular reading.

Ah, I misunderstood your point, I thought you were saying bitcoin was evil.
We're in agreement then.
