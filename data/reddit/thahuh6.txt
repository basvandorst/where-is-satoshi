w-where can I find one from?

And from a pure economic efficiency perspective there is nothing wrong with it. One person has more information and is acting on it, driving BTC toward its true price

This is wrong

Wait, how? Isn't the reward based on probability? So in 51% of the case they will get the reward, 49% it will go to someone else

But there is a substantial transaction cost in getting those BTC back into dollars, which is what people care about

Fiat currency, by definition, is currency that acquires its value from government decree. Bitcoin is not fiat currency

what do they mean by investment account
@_date: 2013-06-25 09:02:41
Do you honestly believe that's the real reason?

So how exactly is it anonymous if every transaction is publicly logged (also, what is the reason for this)? Say the FBI sets up a silk road honeypot, and I hire an assassin from there (i.e. pay the FBI assassin to kill someone), do  they now have my bitcoin address? So when I cash out any bitcoins at an exchange, they will be able to trace my real life identity?

Why hasn't the opportunity for arbitrage between the exchanges closed that gap? Why is there like a $30 difference in price?

It's a currency but also an investment, so in that respect I do think it's a legitimate term
@_date: 2013-10-19 19:18:01


Why is this? What causes the short term fluctuations in BTC's price?
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:37:33
That's when to buy
