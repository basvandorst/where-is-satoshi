Other crypto, most likely litecoin, will overtake Bitcoin. Exchange your bits for lits.

Question is specifically directed at those who've been in the game since mid-late 2013.

Based on the data of the past 3 years, it's probably *one* of the least safe stores of value. Combine this with the current insecurity/undecidedness within the bitcoin community, and it's even worse when compared to, for example, gold. You don't really have enough data to make statements about long-term effectiveness/position of bitcoin.
Furthermore, I believe it is unfair to use numbers from 2009-2013. Yes, bitcoin used to be a few dollars and even cheaper. But the main reason it went up was for speculative reasons. Bitcoin hasn't done really well speculative wise since the last bubble. There isn't really a guarantee that it will happen again, mainly because, unlike the first 2 or 3 bubbles, nobody really expected it. Everyone expects it now, which might be the main reason why it won't happen again.
While past performance is sometimes a good indicator of what might happen in the future, you should not forget that it isn't written in stone. It could go wrong just as easily.

Enjoy buying ethereum. Don't bash an established litecoin with hundreds of millions in monthly volume to push a premined/IPO coin because it has ''kewl features''.

opencart shops were already able to accept bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-10-16 18:14:25
Nothing new. There are many much plugins of bitcoin and other coin payment processors that already support OpenCart, like BitPay, Coinbase, GoCoin, CoinPayments, etc. 
No news...

He was, he was outright lying about the report and forced that FALSE part about altcoins in his title.

People always discredit LTC... LTC is real player in crypto world. I don't care about gimmicks of other cryptocurrencies. Why does Litecoin HAVE to offer something that bitcoin doesn't? Is USD offering something that EUR doesn't offer? If there is space for hundreds of fiat currencies in the world, then there definitely is space for 2 main cryptocurrencies. Litecoin has proven itself over the years; it is a 4 year old coin, which basically means ancient in cryptocurrency world, it is not ''ded'', and sometimes Litecoin volume outperforms Bitcoin volume (like in July). And that is/was REAL volume (volume from OkCoin etc. not even taken into account). 
And yeah, I enjoy the current pumpage :D

Litecoin is faster and more secure and does not have the blocksize issue. Furthermore, Litecoin is the 2nd best known cryptocurrency and is well established; over 4 years old, the most liquid cryptocurrency out there (after bitcoin). Ehtereum is not the only coin with fancy features, there are hundreds of other cryptocurrencies with 'promising' features and other gimmicks, and where are they now? They are out of the picture or have a very low volume. Furthermore, Litecoin is not a premined/IPO coin like ethereum, so if you are looking for 'features' and 'advantages' in an altcoin, I just named several for litecoin. The last time, only a small sell-off was required for ehtereum to crash; the coin has no liquidity. Remember the hype around the cool features of DarkCoin, now called ''Dash''? Just to name an example of a coin with ''cool features'' that has basically vanished. If you believe ethereum can overtake litecoin, then feel free to promote/buy as many ehter as you want.

Don't start twisting words. You were talking about how ether has more to offer than litecoin; you were clearly taking a side. Like I said; feel free to invest everything you have in a premined/IPO coin because it has cool features.

Great year for cryptocurrencies in general.
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:59:27
What do you think is the best coin to go with bitcoin? I personally would say litecoin, but I am a bit confused because of the hype around some new coins (like ethereum). 
Also, I don't think altcoin will overtake the network affect of Bitcoin.

Your arguments about liquidity are stupid.
You are basically saying; why would anyone use a currency with lower liquidity than another currency?
Compare bitcoin to any other currency, and I can ask you the same question; why would anyone use bitcoin when the daily BTC volume is not even one second volume of USD?
@_date: 2015-10-29 18:47:33
Doesn't matter. I'd argue it's basically the same in this day and age; almost everything (money transfer) is digital anyway, just like bitcoin. Sure, there are differences like blockchain vs backed by state and the existence of cash, but there are also differences between cryptocurrencies, which means that cryptocurrencies are unique in themselves, so if you compare 2 unique cryptocurrencies simply because they have a similarity, then I can do the same with BTC and USD... Both currencies, both can be transferred digitally, both are used internationally; there you go, 3 similarities. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:45:51
You had your side already picked.

It doesn't dismiss other cryptocurrencies. Stop these shitty titles, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, but it's definitely not the best and it will **NEVER** be the only one. No matter how hard petty butt hurt people like you try.
If it was dismissing other cryptocurrencies, it wouldn't have stated this:
''¡ Law enforcement must continue and expand successful
initiatives to share knowledge, expertise and best practice
on dealing with Bitcoin and **other emerging/niche digital
currencies** in cyber investigations''
Apparently the other cryptocurrencies are also worthy enough to be under law enforcement's watchful eye.
