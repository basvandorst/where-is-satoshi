If Bitcoin had a Tinder profile it would probably say something like: "If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best."

Wasn't trying to imply you were. I just mean it's not like they can show you a bank statement and their ID and would be easier to fake I would imagine.

You can hope they're a redditor and see your post, but since wallet addresses aren't tied to an identity you'd be risking sending it to some knuckle-dragger who is trying to swindle you out of doing a good deed. It would be hard to prove an identity match to the sending address. 
Just be wary of people suddenly messaging you with sob stories about how they lost $500 in BTC. Best advice would be to find a way to pay it forward somehow, if you don't really want to keep it.

Someone can't take a joke. For the record, I like and hold BTC, but don't post here often because the community is toxic, as you have done such a good job of reminding me. Thank you stranger. I hope you have a good day!

Ok thanks, I thought something like that would be the case. These examples though:
"He mentions it to someone in a cafe or bar.
Word gets around. A burglar raids your home. Kidnappers capture your children and know exactly how much to demand in ransom."
That escalated quickly.

hahaha. "Must send BTC to this address with priority fees when the mempool is empty for faster confirmation times. Must be from a Segwit wallet."

Don't most wallets automatically create a new address for each transaction? Or I should say, don't some of them do that? If so, would it come back as invalid or get sent to another random person?
Yours is the most obvious answer just wondering if the mechanics would pan out as intended.
