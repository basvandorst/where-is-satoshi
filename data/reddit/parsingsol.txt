To me the most important aspect is that ether is being given to over 100,000 un refugee recipients in an undisclosed amount for food rations. 
We now have 100,000 members on the btc block chain killing the deflation factor as they will be actively pulling out every chance they can to get ahead in life. 
They likely purchased these ether at a minimal fee. Now that the price is inflated to 180 'cough'. How do we respecitvely accept the currency in oyr trades? Here U am holding a coin passed on via trade thats inflated to the affective price. Only to recieve a hand full of eth which has absolutely 0 apprecieation as its fractionally valueless without a cap. Meanwhile this ether can deflate to any number at anytime. While the once highly valued btc becomes a cash out. Thus lowering the initial asking price of btc itself. 
We are exchanging a prime utility and coin for a corporate coin. Why on earth is coinbase backing trade into ether?

Classic tactic if you can't dazzle em en lies baffle them in b.s. 
Whats really infuriating to me is that every thread I made to address this scam, was immediately shadow banned. 
Like? Really? Its ok for a single entity to mass rip off its clients and scam an entire community from their investments...
Gee thanks internet:(
If people keep trading btc will tank and eth will be the dominant crypto. There is no way to compete with a half million refugees living off btc's inflation. Imo this is planned-
Maybe its a way to kill btc and thats what they want in their entirety?

*I understand. 
Just worried because (while I choose low priority) I assumed 2 days is a stretch (comfortably speaking).
Ty for the feedback. (Again). Very very new so this is basically my first problem i've ever encountered :/
(probably can't cancel either?):(...

Its a bit of a heist in reality. 
Its rather ironic when cryptos began as a way to escape world pressure and banks. Yet here we are bing corrupted by them the moment they enter the market. I truly dont understand how they are tranaferable or what intergration and deals were made to even consider it?

*the bump fee option (does this pay more)?
The transaction is bot allowing me to utilize the function. 
Whoa is me :(

Honestly a big part of error in this is underestimatimg the pocketbooks behind eth. 
The promotions aspect mush be matched with opposition. Nearly every conversation I have online has an ethereum user coming out talking it up. Then they work in packs on trading floors. Promoting various coins and downtalking others to scam them out of the owners hands. 
Since these users are getting them free, they don't feel the pressure of losses. Its just a fake doller they can use to buy a lotto ticket. 
This is very dangerous to mix in with unsuspecting crypto networks. 
Eth to me is worth the same as doge. Just a scam coin worse then a jokecoin that earned its place on the market. 
Never overlook a wold going into a henhouse. 
There will be blood-
