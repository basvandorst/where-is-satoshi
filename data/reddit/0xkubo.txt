You want to give it a different name? Fork it. Others forked Bitcoin and named it "Bitcoin Cash", deal with it.
I'm being bent out of shape because you are not suggesting anything, you're trying to impose it by calling it whatever you want. But you don't have that right.
Here we are talking about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. But we could be talking about Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Diamond. Same principle applies. You didn't fork any of those coins, you don't get to name them.
If I fork the Bitcoin project right now and name it "Bitcoin Platinum", you don't have the right to rename it to "BPlatinum". It's my fork. It's my coin. I name it whatever I want.
P.S: I don't care about which one is the real Bitcoin and which one will prevail in 5 years. It's all the same to me which one I use to pay for coffee. So long as it's fast and fees are low.

Yes, and that's why one is called "Euro" and the other is "Euro Cash" and not "Euro" and "Euro".
My point is, people who call it "BCash" are just pissed at Roger for what he's doing, but that's not how you win that fight.

Bitcoin is not a trademark. Nobody owns the whitepaper. Stop moaning.

It's moaning. It's not common sense just because you say it is so.
It feels to me you're the ones scared :)

There is a distinction. One is called "Bitcoin" and the other is called "Bitcoin Cash", I don't see the confusion.
About Roger, I couldn't care less about him or what he thinks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:05:40
No need :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:07:00
No, it shouldn't. You can't just go call whatever you want to something you didn't create. If you think he is infringing some trademark or violating some law, then sue him.
Coinbase is a business and if they want to adopt Bitcoin Cash, they should name it Bitcoin Cash because that's it's official name (

I couldn't be calmer :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:44:15
No. You can call it whatever you like. Coinbase should call it Bitcoin Cash because that's what it was named when this coin was first forked.

No, I want people to their research before they invest. If they do, they won't lose money (not the way you're suggesting anyway).
I don't care about "Bitcoin Cash'ers", what they want to prove or if they want to separate themselves from Bitcoin. They could do as they please cause I don't give a fuck.
I just think it's idiotic that people like you want to name something they don't own to whatever they feel like it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:44:06
Oh, I see how you can see it as being confusing to new people. But that's now you do it. People need learn to think for themselves.

You people are fucking idiots. Darwin will catch up to you though.

Honestly, that's a big enough reason for me to simply stop using your service. Thank you for your time.

What app is that?

To be clear, say someone sent me some BTC to a wallet I have on my personal computer and then I transfer those coins to my Bitstamp wallet. What exactly would I need to provide? Just the wallet address on the computer? Isn't that information already available to you within the transaction? Or you'd need something else?
