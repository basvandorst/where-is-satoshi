Yes, avoid regulation at all cost. Audits are oppresive regulation. Regulation is bad. What insane person would ever want rules and laws applied to money? That would lead to anarchy, or maybe taxation?

Lol, not 14c. It’s in satoshis per byte. A bite of chicken will still cost $27 in american fiats, which are italian.

The value of bitcoin is the 180gb of storage and some wasted cpu cycles around usd $10. Doges have some comedy value at least. Do you know what value even be? Hodl on!

If you sell high and buy low you should be fine. Hodling will always bankrupt the unwary.

How many traders even realize they need to do 1031 exchanges every time they trade coins. I guess few of them intend to pay their taxes even though Coinbase gave the IRS all the customer trade info.

The 10x increase was because of spoofy.

Ok, tether has been eaten. OMG, that tether tastes like shit!!!

Can’t do an audit because the balance on the account would be disclosed. Ding Ding Ding, that is the entire point of an audit, to track the money, like not doing illegal things. However, with bitcoin and tether, the only rule of law is gimme. Regulation BAD! Decentralized crimes GOOD!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:25:40
Criminals should be jailed or better yet, horsewhipped. Liars and thieves claiming to be so honest yet refusing an audit that would reveal the crime.

Money fairy? The treasury creates new money last I checked. You can loan 90% of deposits, not 900%. Loans do not create any money. Work and labor create value, the government creates money. Pay your taxes you bunch of money laundering gamblers!

Fake news might be real. Reality exists. The price of worthless trinkets are hard to value.

Hodl to $0??? Why would any sane person do that?
If you think it’s heading to $0, then sell for whatever you can get.
Thereis no easy money, except for OPM.

Yea of little faith! I trust my lord Nakamoto, he will lead us to wealth and salvation, err, starvation...

alternate minimum taxes. You are taxed when you buy, not just when you sell. ATM will fuck lots of peeps.

Deflation is magic. On a long enough scale... we are all dead... so your money is worthless up to the day you spend it.

Chad should fuck Billy’s wife. Billy gets 100 bitcoin. Billys wife leaves him for Chad. Billy commits suicide when coins dip under $100. Chad sold high and got poon. Chad wins!

What is a merkle tree good for? Lol. Decentralized shared ledgers?

Then coins get forked, more are created, and as a group, some of the most inflationary currencies evar. So, bitcoin, deflationary, what a great idea!

No. Nobody does an infinite chain of deposits. You deposit $100 in savings, I borrow $90 and buy pizza ovens. The $90 goes to the oven company and the owner spends it on cocaine. The pizza company pays back the $90 and $5 in interest. The depositor gets paid 2% interest, so the bank makes 3% on the loan. Unfortunately about 2% of the loans fail at about 50% payback. So the bank gets 5%-2%-1% on their deposits, or about 2%. No money created, and profitable for bank until the point that 50% of their loans fail, like during bad times. Value may be created, but not money.

When will our coinbase “hack” occur. Given the amount in the cold wallet, how safe is the system to the rubber hose decryption system, or the underpaid employ bribe hack? I would be seriously worried at every exchange. They should be guarded more than Fort Knox.

Because a stock share is a percentage ownership in a company that actually sells stuff to people. A bitcoin share is attached to bits in a merkle tree. One of these things is different than the other.
