More what?
What I've seen and read lead me to believe that this is nothing more than a brilliant way for organized crime to launder money.
Once legitimate governments find a way of stopping the flow of these things, it will be game over for anyone who has them.

But someone brought these into play by simply coding them. Are you saying there is NO way to up your count by changing the code? I find that difficult to believe in this day and age. We read about all kinds of monetary fraud and bitcoins seem to be perfectly set up for all kinds of shenanigans! Especially if the fraudster is clever and determined enough. Heck, how do you know the person or persons who coded them didn't have exactly that in mind?
It's not like anyone knows who they are, is it?

Why not? After all, someone, one day decided to code these things and literally *poof* them into existence, why can't they change them?
Call me old fashioned, but these things remind me SO much of the Tulips of the 1600's, not only in the manner that they are being produced, but in the hysteria behind them, that I can't help but feel sorry for those who are going to lose a lot of their hard earned cash to them.
I just, can't bring myself to trusting them.
And now someone tells me you can "mine" them on the internet by doing basically nothing? 
Sorry, this just gets weirder and weirder by the minute.

is it true that people can "mine" bitcoins online with a simple program? How the heck does THAT work?
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:21:03
I've read that one. Still explains nothing.
Apparently bitcoins work, because people believe they work. Sounds like bootstrap levitation to me...

"1) bitcoin is trustless by nature "
True, I can't understand why anyone would trust it.
"2) It is backed by math"
What does that mean? My hotwheels collection is backed by math too (I have 150 of them, and can prove it) so what does that have to do with anything?
"3) The coding is open sourced "
So, anyone can simply write a program and "print" them?
"4) "changed or even added to the pool"????"
Yeah, the guy who writes the code simply says "Hmm I think I need a million more" and changes the code to reflect this. Voila!

I've tried, believe me.
I have friends that are trying to get me to invest. But I bring myself to buy into a system of currency that was simply *poofed* into existence by an unknown entity.

You want me to read a statement by the same people who made the bitcoin, that proves that the bitcoin  is real money?
Isn't that like someone claiming the bible is the truth, because the bible says so?
Circular logic train or what?

Thanks for doing exactly what they did; explain nothing.
As yet, NO one has been able to tell me exactly, how these bitcoins differ from the tulips that were sold and used as cash, in the 1600's. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:23:10
I've been trying. And I don't think I'm being judgemental, just very curious.
So far NO one has been able to tell me who invented them, or why they are in any way different from the Tulip craze of the 1600's. 
I know how well that turned out...
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:39:06
Again, these "explanations" are written by people who support (for some reason) bitcoins.
Kind of like a con artist, writing and printing a pamphlet to hand out to potential victims that reads "why this man is not a con artist" and they believe it!
I guess I just don't trust it, and never will. No loss to anyone on either side of the fence I guess.

But gold, unlike bitcoins, actually exists as a real metal. It has hundreds, if not thousands of uses. 
Bitcoins, apparently, have one main use; to help criminal organizations launder their dirty money.
I'm just trying to understand and I have read a lot. Most of it makes zero sense to me.
