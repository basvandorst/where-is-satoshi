Extremely well, all things considered. People live longer and happier lives in places where the rule of law is strongest.

If not now, when?

How about a regulation requiring a periodic independent financial audit to detect these bugs earlier?

That's the point.

Yeah, you're exactly right. Reminds me that John Dewey articulated exactly that in his *Theory of Valuation* paper that I had to read part of many years ago.

I don't think you mean it in the literal sense. USD does not have intrinsic value, it has relational value based on other people's opinion of the value. Unlike an ear of corn, which has nutritive value, or a house, which has value as shelter, money is a social construct. USD is based on trust (that other people will accept its value and that the US govt is viable to continue to require USD as legal tender into the future--a justified trust in this case, but failures of many national currencies in the past should indicate that currencies don't have fundamental intrinsic value and can devalue at any time a society decides they don't like it anymore).

If you mean intrinsic value in a super literal sense, no, we can't eat bitcoins or anything. But in the intended sense that Bitcoin is more valuable/useful/desirable to people than other forms of money, then yeah, of course, or else it could never have the long term growth trend that's been seen... should we start from ground zero and explain how it's different from regular money and how that can be useful?

I agree that neither BTC nor USD have intrinsic value.

Enron. Bernie Madoff triangular shaped solid "hedge fund". You can cherry pick the failures, but generally diversified investing is a good approach to start now not later. If people are thinking of going all in on Bitcoin, they're fools. But if they're thinking of putting in some money here and some there, more power to them.
