Verified fully funded, unopened.
It was loaded in July 2011.

I've seen these sell recently for as much as 2.35 BTC. I verified the public key is still funded with 1 BTC. I ask because I saw that 2011 physical coins are going for up to 100k and since this predates them and there are only estimated to be just over 500 in existence (and less than 500 unopened) it seems they will end up more valuable.
Do you think the premium will increase as interest in bitcoin does, or decrease as the value of bitcoin increases? These come up very rarely so looking for thoughts, Thanks!
Also the bitbill in the picture is not mine, but mine is in perfect condition.

TL;DR, exchanges are the weakest link

That's a record of a sell from earlier this year. More recent ones are closed privately so no way to know what they went for. That's the cheapest record of one being sold I can find.

Just checked out ebay, appears only one 2011 casascius coin available containing 1 bitcoin (and some clams, bitcoin cash, and bitcoin gold because it's old) going for 50k. A 2013 coin is going for 21k or 2.2 btc so that will probably get it's price jacked up. These things are rare, never come up, and could be a huge piece of history. Think of coin collecting, some of those old coins are worth millions.

Details on what you would do if you wanted to trade the coins immediately.

Bitbills were created in 2011 and are believed to have been the first physical bitcoins. They came in ranges from 1 to 20 BTC. The private key is stored behind a hologram sticker.
Do you think the premium will increase as interest in bitcoin does, or decrease as the value of bitcoin increases?
1 BTC bitbills have sold in the 1.6 to 2.35 BTC range. A 40 BTC valuation for a 20 BTC bitbill would make a credit card sized piece of plastic from 2011 worth 400k assuming the wallet is still funded.

Yeah Dude, I think you are good. Your wallet remains valid on any forks because they use the chain as it is at the time of the fork. Any transactions that occur after the fork happen on one chain or the other.

Bitbills came before the coins and are way rarer. I can't find a record of them being sold on eBay only via bitcointalk.org
