This is good and all, but it leaves out those who don't have the time to actively participate in selecting worthy projects. Some people would prefer donating a regular amount every month/year, and letting others handle the allocation. The Foundation, or something like it, is a good model to get these donation. Therefore, having both Lighthouse and the Foundation is better for fundraising than having just one or the other.
