How isn't it working out for them?
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:15:22
The fee was not normal, it was too low to be confirmed. There's a good chance it confirms over the weekend.

At one point about 6 months ago I just stopped receiving 2FA messages from blockchain.info. I had no issues receiving SMS from every other source. Banks, coinbase, no problems. Blockchain.info ...nothing. They laughed at me and told me it was my fault and to suck it. Had to wait 2 weeks to unblock my account.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:56:51
This is the correct interpretation of that graph. Anyone thinking this is spam just doesn't understand very much about how bitcoin works.

pretty sure you need to not give tax advice since you're making shit up
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:59:07
Bitcoin has been around longer than 6 months ...
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:08:21
There have been at least two different times in the past month where 200 sat/b transaction fees haven't cleared in nearly a week. So saying it will be confirmed in less than a day guaranteed is completely wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:27:44
You actually are begging ... DUCY?
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:02:36
How is that a high fee?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:43:31
No, people will still use it. The options are wait, replace by fee, or double spend.

You misspelled "high adoption" there.

@_date: 2018-01-12 01:02:11
Sure you were going to "exchange" it. Would you have posted here if you bought at 13,000 and it went up to 18,000 before you had a chance to "exchange" it? Doubtful ...
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:12:07
If there were insufficient funds in your bank account Coinbase wouldn't know until two business days after the money is taken from your bank account. Blame the ACH network, that's just how it works. So if you initiate a transfer Monday after their ACH window has closed, you won't see the money removed until Wednesday morning, and Coinbase can't be sure you aren't an overdrafting degen until Friday morning.

You could have paid much less if you didn't want it to ever confirm ...
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:32:19
There is no 2 week limit on a transaction. Whoever said that is stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:54:46
Suggestions can, at best, be based on past history. Unless the wallet you're using is hooked up to view into the future, it can't possibly guarantee the fee it suggests will be sufficient to get the transaction verified in the next hour, day, week, month, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:29:30
The last time sub 50 sat/b transactions cleared reliably was Dec 6th. There no reason to think it's going to confirm anytime soon. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:08:41
It's been 9 years. Don't say early participation.

I had a coinbase account for a couple years. I just found out about GDAX a few days ago and logged in via coinbase. Did a sell and ACH withdraw and was not asked for any additional ID verification. YMMV.

Automagically labeling all long chains as "spam" is wrong. Sports betting/casino sites are going to produce long chains as part of normal business. Adoption of bitcoin in these spaces over the past year has been huge. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:16:42
It's been over a week since 30 sat/b transactions have cleared.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:07:03
Whatever ... I'm sure one or two people have done this. It's not happening on any significant scale. This isn't 2006, you can't just walk into a bank with a deed and an "appraisal" scribbled on a napkin and walk out with a 2nd or 3rd mortgage. Even to open a HELOC banks expect you to demonstrate that you're going to use the money to improve the property's value.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:49:35
Bitcoin absolutely was a currency ...
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:47:05
You've given absolutely no evidence for your hypothesis. Literally none.
Here's my theory, lots of merchants stopped accepting bitcoin today.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:30:53
Maybe you should ask Coinbase this question.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:53:40
Probably wait and hope it confirms over the holiday weekend. The 300+ sat/b transactions almost cleared entirely since yesterday. It's not a stretch to think the 200s will go over the next day. It's also possibly fees will jump back to 1000 sat/b. Hard to tell.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:17:51
People aren't not spending bitcoin due to fear of appreciation.
People aren't spending bitcoin due to technological issues. Read up on why steam stopped accepting crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:30:58
Enjoy it while it lasts. With the propagation of this knowledge and increase in tx fees, I predict GDAX will stop covering fees on outbound transfers in the near future.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:37:39
No, this graph is showing lowest fee transactions being dropped from the mempool. If the size of the mempool on a node exceeds the allocated space, lowest fee transactions are dropped. 
Transactions may also be dropped if they haven't been confirmed in a certain period of time. Everyone seems to think that 14 days is the magical time period, but in reality a node can set it's own expiration period.
There's no evidence that the increased number of transactions is not legitimate. Newsflash, bitcoin's gotten a ton of media exposure lately. This means more people buying, consequently more people selling, consequently more transactions. If you have evidence to the contrary feel free to post it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:51:20
People will incorrectly say that 14 days is a magic time. In reality transactions can be confirmed years later.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:18:28
If coinbase doesn't fix this you go to your bank and explain that there is an unauthorized ACH debit from your account. You tell them that you authorized the first $1,000 debit and that the 2nd is a duplicate unauthorized debit. You have 60 days to do this from the date of the unauthorized transaction.
There is a 100% chance this duplicate transaction will be reversed. It may take a few weeks investigation but chances are your bank will front you the disputed amount when they see that it's a clear duplicate transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:24:24
This is not true. People need to stop saying this.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:23:42
No way. Why would you think that?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:36:30
Your understanding is wrong. Transactions can confirm weeks/months/years later. There is no magical 2 week fairy cancelling transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:32:50
That's like saying "I bought some apples yesterday, will they still be good tomorrow?"
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:31:12
Where did you buy the bitcoin? You didn't buy it from blockchain.info. Do you have the transaction ID for the transfer to blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:39:16
You make a compelling argument ...
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:40:35
Transactions don't "drop off" at 14 days. Given you don't know that, I doubt you can help anyone.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:10:45
Since it didn't happen, there won't be any transaction id posted.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:17:27
FYI bitcoin was created in 2009. You don't get to say "Rome wasn't built in a day" when someone asks why it can't handle the current usage. 
Also, how can bitcoin be "attacked" if it's decentralized?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:30:31
Are you kidding?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:58:32
If the transaction wasn't confirmed the fee wasn't taken.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:21:58
That's roughly 140 sat/b assuming a transaction without lots of inputs. That was getting cleared yesterday pretty often.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:09:03
You can't ever be sure the transaction has dropped out of all nodes. You need to empty out that address in a new transaction to prevent the old transaction confirming next week, month, year, decade.
Some people think 2 weeks is a magic timeframe but it isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:51:04
If you had a time machine you could have used that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:20:44
There's no such thing as cancelling a transaction. These people saying transactions expire after two weeks are wrong. Unless you double spend from an address there's no guarantee an old transaction won't confirm days, weeks, months or years later.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:04:51
So you think someone is spending 300+ sat/b to spam the network? This is more plausible than payouts from a sportsbook?
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:39:56
more like  
I deposit  
player B paid out using my deposit  
player B redeposits part of the payout because that's what degens do  
player C paid out using player B's deposit  
player C redeposits part of the payout because that's what degens do

@_date: 2017-12-16 14:22:16
Fees are not voluntary for any practical purpose. Sub 50 sat/b transactions haven't been confirmed since Dec 6th. And lol at bitcoin not being a currency. Start reading.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:23:59
If by normal you mean 100 sat/b transactions are clearing then yes, at this instant things are back to normal.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:47:22
I'm familiar with the basic workings of the ACH network. If the funds were taken out of your bank account Friday morning, then Coinbase doesn't have absolute assurance that the transaction wasn't rejected by your bank until the following Tuesday morning (assuming no holidays). 
That doesn't explain why coinbase won't credit you until Thursday. I'm just pointing out that they absolutely can't credit you until at least Tuesday morning without exposing themselves to massive fraud.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:28:30
Most transactions under 140 haven't cleared since 8am yesterday. Most under 200 haven't cleared since 3am today. If you only want to wait a few hours right now, I don't see how anything under 300 sat/b is going to clear. That's not even a guarantee.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:38:56
Please explain
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:03:43
GDAX pays for the miner fee. Given the spike in cost for transactions, I wouldn't expect this to last.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:44:52
Spammers? The level of sub 10 sat/b transactions was completely flat during the spike last week. Could you explain what you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:48:31
Post the transaction ID or gtfo
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:46:07
No. Post the transaction ID.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:01:03
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:10:01
No, there is no "return to sender" in 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:17:21
No it didn't. Educate yourself about how the mempool and rebroadcasted transactions work before saying stupid things like this.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:40:11
Double spend it manually. You'll need the private key.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:29:58
Answering that question without a transaction ID or more details is impossible.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:32:48
I think it's naive to think free transactions will last through 2017 personally ...
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:50:01
It is correct. Bitcoin fees aren't a percentage of the amount transacted. They're (mostly) independent of the transaction amount and are instead dependent on current network congestion. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:45:54
You're off by an order of magnitude
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:53:30
It has a fee of 40 sat/b. How long do you expect him to wait? Until the 2nd coming?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:43:13
Rebroadcasting a low fee transaction is going to do literally nothing to speed it up.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:33:49
If you could get in a bitcoin and drive somewhere your analogy might not be completely stupid.
