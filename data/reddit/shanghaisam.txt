Let's see, manipulation for the contracts that expire end of January, we'll see 24k by Feb 6th.
Then the memes will be about selling at 10.

You can do this, but you're limited to 10k per day in transactions. You can transfer all into GDAX, but taking out by selling or transferring, it's 10k a day. Unless you apply for a higher transfer amount.

No one knows, we've never been in this space before. But there are a few things that may influence.  Governments around the world have bitcoin farms. Poor countries citizens are adopting bitcoin to buffer against inflation. People worried about bonds/gold buy bitcoin as wealth storage vehicles. Today through the end of the month many bitcoin contracts (shorts) are coming due. I believe bitcoin is being manipulated for this reason.  I hope it will go back up (and I'm betting it will).

how many did you buy at $300?

Really?  You cannot make inferences about non normal data. The data is highly skewed. Also it's a time series data set, so not even the same population.  Also, what's the hypothesis?  You could have use an ANoVA instead.

I think we'll see it drop to $31,000
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:01:36
I really think so. GDAX is popping now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:28:53
I would, and have. Keep in mind you cannot sell for a year if you live in the United States otherwise you'll pay 30% in capital gains tax. A savings account, you can access the money anytime.

don't worry, be happy

The growth of bitcoin is dependent on mass adoption. So far it has it more than any other coin.  This will be the easiest for main stream regulation.  Therefore folks will feel safer with it and big money will move in. It will spike to a high of $55k or so and level around 21,300.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:48:07
I think down to 8k. i have a limit order set to that
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:25:09
you're seeing a consolidation in the market and some panic selling. Great news....
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:23:17
Wait till May. you'll be up $10k per bitcoin.

I believe China outlawed it last year to give them time to buy it. Which they did. All Governments are buying. The US is lagging.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:56:26
Hahaha. I've been riding the train since March. This isn't a drop.
However, keep in mind that when you get up, it'll be back where it was or higher. Asian markets have stones of steel and don't give in to panic sells.

goldman puts these out all the time to shake people from their money. Same here w/ bitcoin.  Why? Guess who's buying them....
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:06:56
Whoever mortgaged their home and bought at $15k, rode it all the way down and then hodl till now.... balls of steel. respect.
If you're reading this, keep hodling

God, ain't this the truth!

so basically your algorithm is a coin that you flip?
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:14:31
Good for you! and great youtube channel.  Impressive you didn't panic and sell at 2400 or then 5000.  Balls of steel this one!
Quick questions:
1. How do you liquidate to fund your bills?
2. whats you thoughts of where this will be next year?
3. If you had $20k right now, would you put into BC?
Thanks a lot and congrats!

i've been looking at the stochastic and I think we'll see a pull back to 7000.  I'm thinking mid December when the Thanksgiving honeymoon ends and the reality of "hey, I need that cash".  You can look forward to a 10x's increase in complaints about coinbase as well.

why 12.9 euro? Thats an odd number.  Why not subscription? 1.99 euro a month?
