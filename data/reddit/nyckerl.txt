I'd like to apologize for my earlier outburst. 
Yes, the site does say it's optional. The reason for my kneejerk reaction stemmed from logging in and being greeted with a rather intrusive form right away. Perhaps it would've been better to have made a small note about the upcoming changes with a link to more information, or perhaps soften the blow by offering some explanation about how our personal data will be safekept and why you feel such information is necessary. 
No matter how you cut it, I think most customers will be instinctively taken aback by that form, whether they need to fill it out or not. Whether necessary or not, I already feel I bent over backwards to set up an account, so the mere sight of more document requests was enough to tick me off.  It's like sitting down at a pricey restaurant to order a $40 hamburger and then the waiter sticks a $1,000 bottle of wine in your face. Presented that way, it doesn't matter if he points out it's optional. I still do not understand why you would want not only our employer, but their contact information on top of it, and not one but two forms of ID when we already submitted one when opening the account, plus a bank account number? I don't know if Canadians will have a different reaction, but all that really needs some major explaining to me before I give up that info.
That said, I have never had any issues with the site and my support questions have all been tended to. I have nothing negative to say about VoS' service per se.
Mike, I hope you take this as a positive thing and use it to learn your customers better.
