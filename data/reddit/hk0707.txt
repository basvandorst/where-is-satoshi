I am very sure, unfortunately

One of us is confused.  Electrum gives one address.  Ian coleman gives another.  They have the same private key.  They use different derivation paths.  And, in electrum, the custom word was entered as part of the seed, while in Ian Coleman it is entered as a Bip39 Passphrase.
I have just discovered that this gets much weirder.  I initially did this on electurm in linux.  When I use electrum in mac, using the same seed and same error (including the custom word in the seed), my funds show up in the wallet, and I have the same address, but that same address now has a different compressed public key (on linux it starts with 02, on mac it starts with 03) and a different private key (on linux it starts with K, on mac it starts with L).  BUT, the same funds are visible in both addresses, despite them having different public keys and private keys.

If you drop that same seed in Ian Coleman's bip39 decoder, with the 25th word as the passphrase, and use Bip49, do you get the same addresses, or different?  The same private key, or different?  because I get a different address and the same private key.

was that a guess, or did you know that somehow?  BECAUSE IT FUCKING WORKED!

I think what I need is the redeem script for the segwit address that I actually have, but I cannot figure out how to calculate it.

the website; I verified the signature, if that's where you're going

It is definitely not a multisig
