No ledger is fine just watch some YouTube videos on it trezor is very easy to use and safe but ledger allows you to store many smaller coins which is important right now because Bitcoin litecoin and ether are very expensive.

Trezor would have been a bit better of a choice for Bitcoin but if your doing altcoins too don't worry ledger is a great wallet

Coin base is super easy but the fees are pretty high and there is a chance that you could loose your coins because you do not hold your private keys, I do not know how familiar you are with crypto investing, but if you are serious or really into it I would buy a trezor hardware wallet. I have bought one and am about 2 months new into Bitcoin. I am not a super techy person and I a young and inexperienced in investing but I have figured out how to secure all of my coins, and I avoid paying fees to a company like coin base. If you are spending more than 5,000 usd defiantly get a trezor its 100% necessary. If you are investing a small amount 1000 and under download coin base and play around with it until you can transfer and increase your investments on a more secure platform where you hold your own private keys.
