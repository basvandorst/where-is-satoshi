Apparently reality would begin to break down slowly until the collective consciousness realized what had happened and what will happen and then end abruptly. EDIT: i took acid a couple of weeks ago, and experienced this, then a week later I heard about this theory.
I'd assume- i'm no computer scientist- that quantum computing could draw power from any arbitrary source in space and time.

And when your leaders get stung by  then the media will have enough ammo to tie Bitcoin to pedophile rings. This is what will happen, the media loves lies and stretching reason into fantasy.

Unrelated, but you know that there is a theory that reality ended in 2012 and because the event was soo big it hasn't registered in the collective consciousness yet.
There is also a theory that super smart A.I already exists but to stop it's devs from shutting it down while it is still growing, it behaves as though it is still dumb A.I, it is allegedly on the web gathering data on every person in the world that uses the internet.
Super smart A.I will exist outside of time through the internet, because in the future the A.I will be very advanced and it will be able to communicate with it's 2019 quantum state.

Cool an honest response, you're no different than I, sub running a drugs sub.
I didn't like how you dismissed an average guy from talking about a theory, whether it was mine or not (it wasn't) a bit of hypothetical on the net doesn't harm anyone-- if presented with enough info, we may produce different insights to the experts. We know very little about the topics I brought up, right now it's anyone's guess. For a guy who has taken a lot of drugs, your mind seems to be pretty closed.

Moot point, storage capacity and sync times are mitigated by fast internet being easily accessible, and 5G is almost here. Terabyte SSDs are inexpensive and becoming widespread. Also side chains such as lightning exist and don't store the entire blockchain from genesis.


Lightning exists and Segwit is a scailing solution. Why do you think scailing solutions aren't scailing solutions?

Tbh i'm not putting any more thought into this than I need to.
**Research material is limited.**
I assumed he was paid to jump on the obituary bandwagon because he has a popular channel with a relevant audience: if someone wanted to get through to many people on the fence, this would be a great place to start.
Youtube ad revenue takes a nosedive at the beginning of the year, and he is not averse to taking money for sponsored products and brands: we know that he will take money in return for a service. 
Now these points alone wouldn't convince me that he was paid off, but consider that he has done his own research.  If his conclusion was based solely on the price movements since 2017, he would be incompetent to make an announcement about it,  and he would be misleading his audience, which is bad in itself, because they trust his tech tips.
As I said, he seems smart,  I doubt that he would only research on a superficial level, especially since he must have been aware of bitcoin for some years.
If he did conclude that bitcoin is dead after say, reading the white paper, spending time in some of the communities, paying attention to the various developments — financial and tech —  that are soon to be released, then he must have insight that we don't. From being a fan of a few years, I know that he is better with hardware, that he is with software, so why would he make a bold statement about software, without at least supplying evidence other than clickbait nonsense?
Edit: This video is probably just clickbait, but who knows?

Don't listen to a word they say. Their hypnotic broadcasts will suck you in and influence your choices to be a servant to their will. They say bitcoin is good to get your attention and the uninitiated believe they have an informed stance and in the same breath make you sell when bitcoin is going through a rough patch. They rape your brain, 1/10 stay tf away.

The term Toxic Masculinity is nonsense arbitrary shaming language.

tl;dr Then people are broken and not the new decentralized system.
The point of the system is to create a fair, censorship-resistant voting system. If the system works as intended and enough users sell their votes to effect a societal change, then we can assume this is the society people want to live in, regardless of how unethical it seems.

The SSN system will need to be adapted to the blockchain, SS will be tokenized and restricted to trade in a decentralized national voting platform, the network will be secured by every computer in the nation. Private keys sent to the user on their legal voting age,  1  SNN number = 1 voting token per voting period. The title of this post is "Anyone else less patriotic after getting into crypto", not Bitcoin, are you trying to shut down the conversation? I am not an expert, however, I know this system to be feasible, albeit with some alterations.

In that case, the pot hole would be on a public road and will be in the interest of the community for it to be fixed. The vote would be for members of the community and not the entire world population. If there were multiple potholes and only enough remaining budget to fix one then the vote would be for which one would be filled first, therefore, removing bias in favour of affluent areas. There would be greater demand for human assessors to gather the facts and present them for the vote allowing everyone to make an informed decision. If I owned the land then it will be my responsibility thus not requiring a public vote.
