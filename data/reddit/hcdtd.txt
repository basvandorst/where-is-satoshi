that's not coinbase's fault. a global payment system needs to be resilitant to this sort of thing
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:41:12
Blocks don’t have to be full- there’s an arbitrary 1mb limit in place. And it’s not up to an exchange to dictate what fee pressure is. Users and the network at large do that, by choosing to transact on the network or not 
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:15:59
monero, ltc, etc all have hard forked multiple times so far, all with no disruption. Hard forks are a normal way to upgrade. Huge disruption only comes when you have certain people dig their heels in and refuse to upgrade. 
A growing blockchain isn’t a bad thing. What’s to say it isn’t too big right now? Should we go down to 500k blocksize? 5-10mb is entirely doable with today’s infrastructure. And 20-50 years in the future, even larger blocks could happen easily (if needed)
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:18:09
So why get mad at one exchange? It very well could just as easily be 100,000 users taking up that space, *using bitcoin as intended*, and we wouldn’t blame them for not batching 
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:12:42
I disagree. It might not be optimal, but nowhere does it say that you must use bitcoin optimally. Nowhere does it say you must batch transactions. Bitcoin needs to function well, with or without batching

Bitcoin had high fees long before coin base was an issue. Implementing segwit will lower fees, but won’t cause them to plummet

But with growth, whatever capacity coinbase is using, could very well just be used by normal users. It isn’t coinbase or the users fault- as the network grows, it needs to accommodate new users easily, something it isn’t doing right now

people will still mine even if the block reward dwindles (which is still a few decades away). 
but by the time the block reward is significantly small, there should be enough users *making transactions on the blockchain* (ie, not LN) to support miners.

why are we talking about 500MB blocks? let's start with 10mb, allow the network to grow organically for a year or two while 2nd layer solutions are put in place. "just wait until we have the solution ready!" is the wrong way to go about this. 
Look at it this way - there are currently about 100,000 - 200,000 new transactions per day on the bitcoin blockchain. assuming there are people on the sidelines waiting for lower fees, we can say there are 500,000 people per day currently wanting to send bitcoin transactions. with a 10MB block size, bitcoin could do about 2.5 million transactions per day, well above the current use. Usages will (hopefully) surpass 2.5M transactions per day, but not for 2 or 3 years. That should give us time to develop/implement LN (not this "just wait it's coming" BS)
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:38:55
Majority of miners do not care about blocksize (back when bitcoin cash had a different difficulty algorithm, miners flip flopped between the most profitable chain).

the 1mb limit was added after the fact. The limit used to be 32mb. but here satoshi talks about increasing the block size 
I have yet to hear a valid reason *from bitcoin holders* on why the 21M limit should be raised.

why is everyone itching for segwit adoption? (i get that it addresses tx malleability) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:55:39
I understand the need to temporarily put a limit in place (1mb) but it was never meant to stay permanently. Changing the block size does require a hard fork, but that's by design. That's how this should work. If people want to stay on the non-upgraded chain, by all means. ETH classic still has quite a decent market cap. Monero has hard forked multiple times, and there's still just Monero (everyone moved to the majority chain, whether they were 100% on board or not). 
and changing the 21M limit to say, 42M would cut the value of each bitcoin in half, so there's no net gain. I can have 10 bitcoin at $16k or 20 bitcoin at $8k. raising the block subsidy just means you get more of something, but those something are worth less, so raising this limit is a distinction without a difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:08:34
B*tcoin cash certainly could be the answer- you can have both larger blocks and lightning network. They aren’t mutually exclusive. In this case a block size increase would buy enough time to get a second layer solution working well. “Just wait it’s coming we promise” is horrible PR 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:50:37
it wasn't always horrible. only since the block size reached capacity 
I used to be able to go into bars/stores and pay, and within 10 min they would get a confirmation for less than 10 cents. and just having the transaction show up in the mempool was enough for these "micropayments" (who's going to put effort into reversing a $15 transaction)
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:50:11
increasing the block size to 4 or 8MB won't lessen bitcoin's decentralization at all. sure - if it got to 100mb or something crazy, yes, but we aren't talking in extremes. slow and steady progress and adaptation as the network needs it. it's no coincidence that bitcoin's overall marketshare plummeted just as blocks became full. 
More people are using btc compared to BCH, but I would argue the btc usage *would be even higher* if they increased the blocksize. There are a lot of people standing on the sidelines. Think about all the wallets that have &lt;$100. no one is going to move their funds right now. 
block size should be increased modestly first, especially since other solutions aren't ready yet. And bitcoin's value most certainly comes from the number of users. If there weren't users, there'd be no value. It's not a better medium of exchange at this point. It's the *default* which is why so many people still use it, but it's no longer the best. 
bigger blocks (8, 10mb) will not affect decentralization in any way. As it stands now, bitcoin will be defeated by another crypto that better adapts to market demands 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:00:49
I have a lot of people interested in bitcoin and ask me to help set up wallets, buy, etc. it’s sad I can’t do that anymore. As you as you explain the fee issue to them, they immediately become skeptical and wonder why I’m even bothering with bitcoin at all
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:33:32
still, decreasing fees are good overall - it means more users will get on board, and that's what you want long term. 
bitcoin's % of all crypto... livecoinwatch.com no equation needed. 
btc already validated a &gt;1mb block (thanks to segwit...I think?), b*tcoin c*sh validated an 8mb block, not sure what LTC has been up to, but full blocks there wouldn't be a problem (no reason to assume there *would* be a problem). 
Seriously...there's no reason for btc to stay at 1mb....i mean if the cap had been 500k, would it be stuck there today? Think about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:29:16
that's the nature of a decentralized system. not everyone is going to agree to all changes. but whatever the majority agree on, matters. those who disagree can go start their own thing or agree to go along with the majority.

it's bad practice to keep funds on any exchange. if you don't control your private keys, you don't control your money.

Increasing the block size is a fine solution for the foreseeable future. There is no harm in increasing it. It does not devalue the currency at all. In fact I would argue the value would go up. I don’t think it is a coincidence that bitcoin’s marketshare plummeted just as blocks became full. 
Bitcoin already has legitimate competitors, which I believe it is currently losing to. LTC is 4mb per 10 min, no reason why bitcoin can’t be either. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:26:24
It’s ~1.7mb, only if everyone was using segwit. Almost no one is. So blocks are effectively still 1mb. And 2mb is too little too late. We need 4, 8, even 10mb yesterday. It’s not the long term (and only) solution for scaling, but it gives us at least a few years to get LN or something else implemented. And in the future, 100mb blocks will be entirely possible (they might even be possible now, we don’t know). 
Right now we have Litecoin (4mb per 10 min), BCH (8mb per 10 min) and btc (1mb per 10 min). Not sure what the others are but if the network can handle all those separately, there’s no reason that capacity can’t be run on one chain- bitcoin *could* have 13mb blocks no problem right now. 
And it’s not the fault of coinbase etc preventing bigger blocks, it’s the Core devs who refuse to hard fork (hard forks are normal, by the way, and were meant to happen). 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:11:08
will a 50% reduction matter though? I'm all for paying lower fees, but $32 instead of $64 (median btc fee) is still crazy. we need *drastically* lower fees.
isn't it a little ironic that everyone here says a block size increase isn't enough, we need more than just linear capacity increase, yet a modest reduction in fees is somehow good enough? No, we need a *huge* reduction in fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:59
stating facts doesn't matter who it comes from 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:21
decreasing fees does not devalue the currency - in fact it will *increase* the value of the currency, because more people can use it. The value of bitcoin is in the number of users. Fees have nothing to do with the price of bitcoin going up or down. 
Fees don't need to sustain miners right now - that's why there's the block reward (currency 12.5 btc per block). With growth, bitcoin can sustain itself with just fees - but micro fees from many many users, not huge fees from a few users. 


bitcoin's % of all crypto
There's no reason for bitcoin to stay at 1mb when there are other coins with larger blocks that are doing just fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:14:21
changing the blocksize now does not affect the future scaling at all. Segwit/LN can work with any block size. This needs to be done *before* other scaling solutions (especially since they are untested - at least a blocksize increase is a known, stable way to increase capacity and lower fees). 
We need to put pressure on Core devs to increase the blocksize before we put pressure on CB to integrate segwit.

@_date: 2017-12-23 22:41:05
changing does not have to be controversial - no one is stealing from anyone here. it's just a set of rules that the majority decide are best. nothing is being taken from the minority - it's just their preferred rules were determined to not be in the best interest of everyone. 
And hard forks aren't bad- that's how the networks are supposed to upgrade and improve. Bitcoin has hard forked several times over the years. Monero has hard forked multiple times, ETH has hard forked. it's normal process. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:02:09
A few things - 1mb is arbitrary and was meant to change. 
And have you seen the chart of daily bitcoin transactions over the years? It steadily increases until it hits the 1mb limit...now we are “at capacity” just because. Raising the blocksize can coexist with other scaling solutions. There’s nothing magical about 1mb, less decentralization doesn’t occur at 2mb or even 4mb (and if it did, the argument could be made that we should go down to 500k blocksize)
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:42:57
what else are new users supposed to think when they are faced with $10-$30 fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:23
What? LN can work for bitcoin, if Core would actually implement it. But it’s not going to work well without a blocksize increase (unless you want really high fees for opening/closing channels)
