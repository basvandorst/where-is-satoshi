I'm just asking because My breadwallet transaction keeps coming back rejected 
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:57:23
Then why all the talk about the "necessary" hardware wallets 
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:32:57
Now I see the overall issue of Bitcoin.  Shit. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 07:13:29
Happened to me earlier. 4 hrs for a confirmation
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:04:06
I'm just concerned.  My breadwallet keeps coming back rejected.  It's been 3 hrs
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:52:33
I'm having the same issue !
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:17:18
How legit is this site. Let's say I'm looking to buy 10btc 
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:02:05
Sure. Lol
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:18:48
What are our other options 
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:52:57
I rescanned the breadwallet but transaction still unconfirmed.  Is this a bread wallet issue or in general ?
@_date: 2017-01-02 01:10:22
This is mine.  Been 3 hours.   The fee was set by breadwallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:18:48
Moving to my trezor.  It is on both my trezor and breadwallet stating. no confirmation 
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:55:09
When u plug in. It will let you know if it has been compromised 
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:39:35
The what are the benefits of having a trezor if breadwallet is just as good ?   I saw a YouTube clip of someone being able to break into an iPhone. ( showing the police they didn't need Apples help, when the controversy happened due to some terrorist attack)
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:59:36
I can't locate it but I know John mcafee had a video breaking into the iPhone as well 
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:25:27
I'm down !  What's the details.  I'm new 
@_date: 2016-12-24 08:25:16
Thanks.  Yea I have prime so gonna get from Amazon 
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:30:44
Yes.  Many times.  After I scan. This message reappears. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:26:12
I just bought one with Amazon prime.  $120
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:29:33
If 1m is safe. Why is everyone on the trezor band wagon.   
@_date: 2016-12-31 04:14:00
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:16:01
Hey i just posted this because this has to help the bitcoin cause.  There needs to be an easier way for people to "SPEND/UTILIZE" bitcoin to the millions of stores that do not accept bitcoin yet.  I think this will get more people to get into bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:37:01
How do I secure my interest ?  
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:19:34
Hey.  Since you are the cto.  How many bitcoins is safe to store on breadwallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:30:47
Should we worry if coins are on copay ?  What if we never touch it. Are we safe ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:04:31
How does the forked coins work if we transfer to nano from let's say bread 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:28:19
What app 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:47:50
I am reading otherwise 
They are saying copay is not allowing for the forked coins ?  Is this true 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:58:57
I'm reading a lot on this thread and it keeps referring to copay being a bad actor and that we won't get the forked coins. Is this true ?  
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:49:51
Ya got ��
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:34:17
I haven't touched copay wallet in a while. Prior to any forks.  What should I do. Eli5
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:56:36
Can you eli5 on how to split   By transferring do you mean sending?
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:50:56
Can you eli5 about legacy and segwit 
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:07:28
Did I read somewhere breadwallet is not good for the 2x potential fork?
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:01:29
Yes.  I do
Not get the option to start the update 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:27:13
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:37:20
Yes. Tried both    Nothing happens 
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:49:12
Breadwallet is bad?
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:57:26
 Agreed.  Same 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:32:53
You ready to sign a Nondisclosure ? I got a brilliant idea 
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:18:56
Is it safe buyin on Amazon ?
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:43:19
Can you elaborate more? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:58:49
But they will pay $2.50 for some mbtc
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:35:38
How the hell is it insider information.  This is not a publicly traded company. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 09:34:29
What kind of developer. Do you have any background in developing or going cold into it ?
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:35:16
Is the live feed working ?
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:04:02
App is down too for iOS 
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:38:05
How can I get this 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:43:58
Split it up. 5g each buy.  All in
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:41:26
I can import the 12 word seed from copay to let's say breadwallet ?  Or even a ledger or trezor?
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:11:57
What if the hardware wallet is compromised.  They say don't put all your eggs into one basket.  Would it be unsafe to spread them around to different combination of wallets
Ie bread.  Trezor. Keepkey. Etc 
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:30:10
Been doing it.  Dm me if you interested 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:21:33
How is gbtc valued.  Do they have a stock pile of bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:36:38
Yea. But now i don't feel like adding in my info
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:25:33
What do you mean.  So breadwalllet is not a good one to hodl on?
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:36:53
Yes.  My breadwallet does not have the option to buy Bitcoin.  Should I delete and reinstall the app?
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:13:14
If he disclosed. Bitcoin is awesome.  Out to the 2 billion daily users.  And everyone wanted to buy..   the price would insanely appreciate 
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:56:01
One day late.  But it has arrived !
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:34:58
Probably on a private island with a lot of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-05-22 02:26:02
So if we have coins on Multiple different webwallets such as mycelium,breadwallet, copay etc.  Are we good?  Also what about hardware wallets?  
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:11:36
Why is this cause for concern of a sellout
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:00:40
Yea. You essentially need a Korean social security number to get access to korbit. 
I can help you with this. Pm me for details 
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:27:39
Check the price on korbit.  Someone has to have a Korean social security to open an account.  Sales are instant ( Bitcoin is treated like a credit card in korea). So when you sell.  You are on the hook personally.   Then a $35 wire back to America.  Rinse and repeat.  
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:08:48
Like me. Muhahahhaha
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:33:50
Japan colonized and eradicated Koreans on a daily basis. Get your history right. Holocaust but you don't hear it because we are not Jewish 
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:10:55
I've been doing it already. ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:25:07
And what if they get hacked.....  
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:17:39
They'll give you max a few hundred dollars for it.  Unless there is organic traffic landing on your page. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:04:04

@_date: 2017-05-10 20:03:54
I have a spot for you in CT.  Can I be your franchisee ?
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:28:09
I mean. If Bitcoin were to be worth $1,000,000 in 20 years.  That's probably equivalent to the buying power of $100,000
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:51:03
Are you 100% Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:36:04
So just still with the gold standard 
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:27:11
And it's $10.  Did you lose $1.50?  Wtf

@_date: 2017-05-16 03:24:02
How do you I buy and should we start buying ?
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:17:52
Can you briefly explain this?  Is there equity involved  ?
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:40:49
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:47:23
Fuck the stock market. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:56:11
I split them among breadwallet and copay as well as hardware wallet 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:57:09
Then why don't you sell. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:54:03
Damn.  Wonder how much Charlie has.  
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:09:06

@_date: 2017-05-26 19:15:55

@_date: 2017-05-11 04:54:23
Sent you an email
@_date: 2017-05-20 09:38:47
This article is complete garbage 
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:16:06
Can someone explain to me what this signifies ?
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:52:01
Can you give some hypotheticals of what could determine the price action 
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:59:52
When did you start
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:15:30
Is holding a few coins on breadwallet safe ?  Seeming it has gone up in value. When it was worth $500. I didn't care. Now that it's moving...  should I move it to a more secure device ?  
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:00:36
Why disappointed ?  Isn't this good news?
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:32:59
Last time I checked they were on par.  A few months ago 10% higher in Korea.  
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:14:27
Can you explain like I'm 5 yrs old 
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:30:00
Damn.  So having 12 is a good amount for long term hold ? 
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:44:27
Ehhhh...  trading Bitcoin for game coin?
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:06:12
How would it be distinguished.  Like I have a few wallets.  So should I go back to a wallet that is hodling some coin?  
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:21:33
Isn't what the "decided" good for Bitcoin.  ?
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:00:01
Can I join your team 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:00:23
I agree.  Will bring more people to Bitcoin.  I can't count the number of people saying $2500+ for Bitcoin???   But if it was in smaller designations. I bet everyone and their mother would buy $100 worth

Can someone summarize this video in one paragraph.  Don't feel like watching 
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:58:48
Hi. I am still waiting for the ability to buy Bitcoin via breadwallet.  Why do I not have that option. ?
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:03:47
Also.  It is hard to get it.  That is why the premium is high 
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:40:27
I updated the app and I signed up. But it still does not give me that option 
Am I missing something 
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:39:25
What defines rich.  Especially with inflation.  $1,000,000 10-20 years from now will be........ 
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:14:11
Can anyone chime in on this ?
@_date: 2017-05-19 04:15:25
Still no Bitcoin. :(
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:43:07
Should I obtain different types of hardware wallets ?  Ie. A trezor. Keep key. Ledger.  All holding 33% each ?
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:46:54
Is it profitable ?
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:41:28
Yea I understand that.  But it's saying you can convert your Ira to buy Bitcoin.  Is that such a thing ?

Funds have already cleared.  Please let me know.  Thank you 
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:41:48
If I'm of mistaken your gains would qualify for income.  So if you had let's say 400,000 in gains you would be in the 400,000 tax bracket 
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:00:09
That is a bold statement

@_date: 2017-06-12 00:24:17
It's been 20 min. But usually I get the transfer first.  And then the confirmation later on.  I don't even see it on the blockchain that anything has been initiated.
