*most likely* go up 
Careful, that's dangerous thinking.

I've seen recommendations to switch to Gemini but have they been under a similar load as Coinbase? If everyone switched would they fare the same?

Are you asking about investing in *bitcoin* or *blockchain*? They are not the same thing. 
Any investment is risky and you *should not* be investing money you can't stand to lose - this is investing 101 that has nothing to do with the soundness of either bitcoin or other things built on blockchain. 
Blockchain *does* have a bright future and it will most likely be used for all the things you mentioned. I don't see why that's at odds with telling people to invest wisely.

While I understand the frustration, I try as best I can to cut them some slack. 
While yes, if they want to be a big boy exchange then they need to act like it, I'm not sure how even the most well established trading companies would handle if the USD tripled in price over 6 months. These exchanges are young and operating in a undeveloped market; it would be shocking if they endured the last two weeks without any major black eyes - honestly curious the amount of traffic coinbase.com is getting every second. 
With all that being said, the exchanges on net are forging a path to a better crypto trading scene for all of us. This is why I always tell friends interested in getting in on the action to never invest more than they can lose and to understand how much of an infancy this whole show is still in!

Exactly. 
There's risk in both scenarios. The chance of Coinbase screwing your over versus you yourself.
