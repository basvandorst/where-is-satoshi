I also believe people who never bother to verifiy (because we simply have the **option** offered by Bitfinex NOT to) should be notified about such changes. Again. Especially after the hack.

Can someone explain what BitCache is? What's the purpose? 
@_date: 2016-10-12 09:55:36
Yes. Depositing bitcoins into an exchange means its all about drugs and criminal activity! LOL. Will send in all documents and information as soon as they reply my latest email :D. Didnt Coindesk.com recently release a analysis that the criminal usage of bitcoin is only a extremely small percentage? Dont draw these stupid conclusions just because you deal with drugs yourself. It is quite an offensive and insulting claim to apply on someone you dont even know.

See my reply regarding the "whole story". But again. I have done this for a very long time. After the hack. This starts to happen. I'ts my right to wonder what is going on and to investigate if anyone else experienced the same thing. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:10:31
I wonder if this actually works. Would be great if it does. But I am being told they will refuse to pay out anything until I have submitted the documents and answers to their questions. Anyone with a law degree?
@_date: 2016-10-12 10:00:39
But exchanges also have law enforcement contact. Most likely on a daily basis :P. Which I guess mixers do not have. In other words not a wise idea to send to an exchange ^^ haha. All of a sudden the cops have a lead where it landed to... and can follow the bitcoins from there? Anyway. Only my theory. Does not matter anymore. They just told me send in the information &amp; documents to solve this whole incident. Will update.

Thank you so much for your reply and information regarding this. Appreciate it.
The exact circumstance is the following: I have, with Tor (never been an issue and not according to Zane either), registered a total of 6 Bitfinex accounts where I put in equal amount of BTC (+/- 1 or 2 BTC) to store as seperate vaults instead of everything at one place. Yes. Everyone would call me stupid for using an exchange as a wallet provider but lets not get into that now :D. Its just so much easier to have online access. And yes. I am aware an exchange can get hacked etc. I dont imagine it can happen AGAIN however.
Around 8-9 hours after the deposits were made I decided to request a withdrawal for some bitcoins. Bitfinex have a problem with this because they dont want people to use Bitfinex as a mixer (which was never my intent... I just needed some of my assets which is why i wanted to withdraw). Fine. I understand that.
The address I sent the bitcoins to, were all fresh with 0 history. Which also made them think i sent them To a mixer. But that is wrong. Its actually going to a Localbitcoin address (which I have screenshoted of course).  They also did not like that the address before reaching the deposit address were only showing activity hours before the deposit was made. However. I was able to sign addresses that were used Prior to them as well (which shows older activity date)... If that makes sense. 
Because of this, which of course might look suspicious, they wanted me to verify my identity. Which I did 3-4 days ago (depending on the time zone). Attached lots of photos. My passport, national ID (front &amp; back), me holding both separately, me holding the email of their requirements, the email along with my passport &amp; ID, utility bill in english, a bill in my language, receipt from paying the utility bill, screens from all the localbitcoins accounts showing the same addresses i requested withdrawals too and an explanation of the above. 
Now I am waiting for a reply. Quite nervous since it was roughly 138 BTC in total. I only managed to withdraw around 11.9% before they froze my ability to withdraw and needed to verify me. Bfx has for a long time been me and my friends go to exchange. A bit shocked and sad this happened. But hopefully it will get solved by this simple verification.
This is pretty much what happened. The only reason I didn't wanted to show emails were because I thought i was too personal in them. But this is what happened. Feel free to add any details I missed out Zane.
Anyone knows how long a verification process normally take with Bitfinex? Or where they are located/what time it is in the Bitfinex office right now? Maybe I am stressing out too much... But it stresses my whole body so bad that they wont reply at all after I now have proved my identity. Just say **something** please. Just the thought of Bfx got hacked and now maybe do not care so much about their users scares me so so much :( 
Fingers crossed... Thanks in advance!
ps. Sorry if i am overthinking it and maybe just simply need to be patient.. Maybe they are looking into it already. Maybe they have a backlog. Maybe the Sunday doesnt count since its holiday. Would love to know an estimated time when i will be able to access my funds.

Unfortunately I am not. But let's not say this is the end already. I just received my 2nd or 3rd reply from Bitfinex a few hours ago. This whole incident have basically just started. Maybe they actually **will** process my withdrawals soon. We will see.
@_date: 2016-10-16 03:19:31
Thanks for your input! Will submit all the files needed later today. Lol. No. They are not stolen. They did freeze my accounts because I opened multiple accounts (via Tor), deposited and withdrawed a bit too quick in their opinion - without trading. Which made them think I am using Bitfinex for mixing. They just want to make sure I am a real person :P That is the only reason :)


Interesting! Is this really how it is? Any source? Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:25:39
See my reply above. "Some shady shit". Uhm... Right lol. No.
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:24:39
That's funny. Just because I do not post from a reddit account that have a solid post history, it means I am automatically a troll? Yikes. Gotta love logic thinking. Are you the kind of person that only believe people who call themselves politicians :D? Good luck in life my friend.
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:26:45
I believe they at least should make the **definition of a non-verified *VS* a verified account** a bit more clear.
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:15:49
Wise words!
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:18:37
Does AML/KYC on solo usage of cryptos really exist yet? Strange that many services doesn't seem to care then. The owner of Blockchain.info should be jailed for life :P. And just as jamiestarrr replied below me. This have never been an issue before. Do you understand? :)
@_date: 2016-10-11 10:16:52
Way too soon to say. Right now I haven't even tried submitting the documents requested. Afterwards however. I will be able to tell you ;)
@_date: 2016-10-10 17:16:43
Maybe this should be crossposted in aswell?
