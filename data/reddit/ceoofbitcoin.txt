What you would do is start mining your own blocks without publishing them. Eventually, your private blockchain will be longer than the public blockchain. When that occurs, at any point you can publish your private blockchain and it will replace the public blockchain. That means that the transactions that were in blocks that got displaced are sort of "reversed" (it's as if they never happened). So this is what you would do:
* Start mining a private blockchain from the current head of the public blockchain (say block H)
* Ignore all blocks that get published on the public blockchain after block H (H+1, H+2, etc.)
* Spend your coins on the public block chain
* On your private blockchain, transfer your coins to a different addresses
* Once all your coins have been spent and you've received the goods/services/fiat for spending your money, publish your private blockchain which doesn't include any of your transactions
* Your blockchain will be adopted since it is longer, and since you didn't include any of your transactions in your blocks, it will be as if they never happened. Your balances will go back to what they were before all the spending.
* The transactions that got displaced can never be republished since the blockchain now shows that the coins have been transferred to a different account.
At that point you would have control of all of your bitcoins, but still have all of the goods/services/fiat that you spent them on in the old (now invalid) public blockchain.

This is accurate but he's talking about a corrupt mining pool lead, which is quite different than an entity like the NSA which has control of their own hardware. With a mining pool the members of the pool can (and would generally have incentive to) leave the pool if the leader were acting maliciously, which quickly neutralizes the attack. With an entity like the NSA, there's no clear way to remove them from the network without changing the core rules of the bitcoin network (specifically the rule that the longest chain is always accepted).

Correct. Bitcoin keys are ECDSA keys, which is based on the Discrete Logarithm Problem as opposed to the Factorization Problem. The private key is the exponent and the public key is the generator point to the power of the private key, which is easy to compute but difficult to reverse.

He could have used coinbase to purchase bitcoins or he could be a merchant that accepts bitcoin with a coinbase account. We don't know that he was using coinbase for any kind of long term storage, only that he attempted to transfer 800BTC away from his coinbase account.

You can't make a quick software patch for a problem that nobody knows how to solve. Bitcoin's value comes from the fact that it solved a very long-standing distributed networking problem but it's solution rests on one fundamental assumption: that the majority of the processing power of the network will be honest. 


Not sure what you mean by plate spinning. It would require a lot of money and hardware, something the NSA has both of. [The amount of processing power in the network can currently be purchased with $20 million dollars.]( Compare that to the $10 Billion dollar NSA budget.




You're free to dwell or not dwell on whatever you choose, but this is fundamentally how security works. You strengthen the system by finding it's weakest points and strengthening them. This is how bitcoin was created and how it will be improved.

A 51% attacker could reverse whichever transactions they choose.

If quantum computers can solve DLP then it will be possible to derive private keys from public keys.

You're right, duh. Fixed.


Interesting question. One idea could be a virtual short: Virtually "buy" 2 bitcoins from him right now, which he is obligated to buy back when the price hits either $200 or $2,000.
Another idea: Futures. On a given time and date (1 year from now for example), you will send him $900 and he will send you 2 bitcoins.
Not exactly the same types of bets, but just brainstorming.

I would take Kane's side of that bet anytime, since it puts him in a no-lose situation. If he buys 1 bitcoin right now for $450, two things can happen:  
1) Price hits $200 so he wins the bet. He loses $250 on his bitcoin investment but gains $1,000 on the bet, so he's up $750  
2) Price hits $2,000 so he loses the bet. He gains $1,550 on his investment and loses $1,000 on the bet, so he's up $550  
He's going to more than double* his small investment in bitcoin regardless of what happens.

Private keys are not useless on their own, the associated public keys and addresses can be derived from them easily.
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:01:25
The difference is that in ECDSA the public key can be computed directly from the private key, while in RSA you need more than the private key to compute the public key. You also need ϕ(n) where n is the modulus, and ϕ(n) is not necessarily stored after the private/public keys are computed.

Why does he believe that a "massive covert operation of chip fabrication" is something  a nation-state is not capable of? The NSA has a &gt;$10 Billion budget and we don't know how much computational power they already have. And his comment that we would "kick those bastards off the network" makes no sense to me; Bitcoin network was not made to be resistant to a [Sybil attack]( There's no way to know if a block is an "NSA" block or just a block from an unknown source. Unless we create an identity "white list" that determines who can publish blocks, there's no way to stop valid blocks from entering the network (and, needless to say, a white list like that would undermine the entire premise of bitcoin).
He also says that the government isn't good as doing "massive conspiracy." Whether or not that's true, it wouldn't have to be a conspiracy to be effective. The government could send out a press release that says "we've diverted all of our computational power to the bitcoin network with the intention of destroying it" and unless the honest players were able to procure more computational power than them, they'd succeed.

Complete control *of the blockchain*. An attacker with 51% hashing power can: 








Protection from double spending is the core value of bitcoin. A 51% attacker destroys the core value of the bitcoin network. 


Miners use whichever blockchain is longest and a 51% attacker will generate the longest chain every time with very high probability.  Switching away from the longest chain would mean changing the core rules of the bitcoin network and it still wouldn't escape the 51% attacker.
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:39:41


The statement was about exchanges "rolling back" after a 51% attack, which makes no sense.


A single 51% attack could easily be a death blow to bitcoin. I don't know why you're assuming that an attacker with complete control of the blockchain would waste their time with a small exploit. 
Waiting "for more confirmations" does nothing against a 51% attacker. The attacker can generate blocks faster than the rest of the network combined, which means they can generate a chain for as long as they want before releasing it.

I can't speak for all of them, but a couple that I've seen:
* The early investors are getting rich, therefore it's a scam, therefore it's a Ponzi scheme. This argument shows no understanding of what a scam is or what a Ponzi scheme is. Early investors getting rich is not a sign of a scam, unless you're prepared to say that every startup that has ever become successful is also a scam.
* The MtGox fiasco. MtGox could sort of be compared to a Ponzi scheme. We still aren't sure what exactly happened, but MtGox did successfully fool people into thinking that they owned assets that they didn't, so it has that in common with a Ponzi scheme. For it to officially be a Ponzi scheme it would also need to meet a couple of other criteria (namely that Mark was pocketing the money). MtGox isn't bitcoin though. People can be scammed out of bitcoin just like they can any other currency, that doesn't mean bitcoin itself is a scam.

@_date: 2014-06-08 22:33:54


What do you mean by "roll back?" Exchanges can't reverse transactions that have been accepted into the blockchain.


That wouldn't do much against a 51% attacker. An attacker with &gt;50% of the hash power can displace as many "confirmations" as they want.


This could help fight money laundering but would do pretty much nothing against a 51% attack.

Right. I think he's asking about making a "copy" that would have the correct public key, but under the sticker is a picture of a middle finger (or whatever, just not the private key).
