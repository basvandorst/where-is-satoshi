I thought after 2weeks it gets cancelled. But I have been hearing that there is someone out there who is rebroadcasting low fee transactions, possibly to keep the mempool full.

I know the pain man. I made my first btc purchases back at $700 then at 1k, and most people would think wow awesome, but this 1k was followed by a crash over a year to $200s. I knew of btc earlier but I got into btc for the get rich hype in 2013, but I then looked at what it was and I'm like there is real promise here this is the future and maybe every other month when I had extra money I just bought some more bitcoin. 4 years later we finally got back over 1k again, then I'm like lets just let this ride now. Held through MtGox hack, segwit never getting implemented miners have too much power feeling, bitfinex hacked, fraud bitcoin gonna die. I don't think there is much that will scare me to sell I'm in it for the long haul and just curious how this all plays out now in the future years as I think this hype cycle really brought a whole new set of eyes to what bitcoin is and is trying to do.

My first bitcoin was purchased for $1010 in December of 2013, lol. But kept buying even as low as 270. now I'm just glad I didn't walk away.

if you have the computer she was on search for wallet.dat file in all folders/including hidden/system folders, most bitcoin wallets saved the wallet to that name.
@_date: 2018-06-16 18:42:11
coinbase was popular back then too. if she can have her search her email around the dates to see if she see's signup emails for something bitcoin related site.

Yeah I think the binance FUD is over. Sounds like they are reversing transactions already, doesn't look like any coins was taken off so I think the panic is over.
The fear and the possibility of those 180,000 mtgox BTC keep selling could cause sell pressure if they actually do keep selling. I don't know why they couldn't just sell OTC though.

BitTorrent the nodes will only get more data. No BitTorrent node says sorry I know I had that piece but not anymore.
In lightning payments move money around in the node, a route one second may not be a route later as transactions use the funds in the channel.

Per they are backed up around a month for verifications. Someone I know signed up a week ago and hasn't heard back on the verification.

If you need it tonight you're going to need to use an ATM if there is one around you. An exchange will need to go through verification.
 or Google map to find one.

Another good way for the government to link your wallet with your identity. I wish we had more privacy on bitcoin. Hopefully eventually on another layer.

It use to be free on both but when they added the fee they only did it on coinbase.

Try bitflyer USA, they are not as backed up as some on verification. Only took a few days for a friend recently. But you have to wire money in, don't think they do ACH.

He originally said less then 1 million btc mined.

Trezor needs to add bech32 address support. I'm going to wait till bech32 address are more common before switching myself. Wallets/exchanges need to support bech32 to know how to treat bech32 addresses or is gonna be hard moving BTC around.

Has monero become a bitcoin layer test bed? I'm feeling like every good altcoin/idea out there will end up a bitcoin sidechain/layer eventually.

Less then a million? 18.8 million have been mined so far. Many lost forever though but not 18million lost. The mining difficulty adjusts to match current hashing power to create blocks every 10 minutes. It doesn't increase because time passes, it increases because more hashing power is mining bitcoin.

Ah haven't used my trezor in awhile and didn't realize. Thanks

Bitcoin isn't ready today but I'm ok holding bitcoin now and waiting 10 years for price to stabilize to use it as a currency then.
I sent emails from a command line, in a terminal window. What bitcoin is today will be different when it's ready for mass adoption. The hurdles will be overcome in time.

I do like Gemini and would recommend them but verification is currently backed up over a month on Gemini. Bitflyer will you have you verified in a day or two.

You watch the documentary on him? It's on Netflix. I heard he was nuts but ya wonder how much is exaggerated. I have a solid opinion of him now that he's totally fucking nuts after watching it. But he's charismatic so people listen to him.

paging Did you know bitcoin is dead again? Better sell before it's $100 ;)

I'm not sure if that is entirely accurate. It's a VISA debit, so it's still charging the merchant visa fees like a credit card when you select credit when you swipe it. Shift is probably making some % from usage too. My VISA debit from my bank use to give .25%, nothing really to brag but it was something.

It's useful for mobile wallets since the wallet/node won't always be online so other wallets won't try to open channels with them just to connect to the network.

I think a realistic fee structure is a good thing. I don't know if I like the $10 either but I know "Free banking" tends not be be free.
