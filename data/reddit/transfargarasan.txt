To crash a market worth half a trillion any single bank would not be enough. Multiple international banks would have to join. They would in turn buy bitcoin and other alts. Then After fomo hits they sell. Too bad. At least 10% of those buyers will hold. Recycle every year's 50% drop 3 times every year. Banks lose more than regular peope because they act like regular people. When in fact bitcoin and alt holders act like banks. Reverse psychology it works.

The point of bitcoin is that you own it. Doing this would not only be complicated but also defeat the purpose of bitcoin.

I bought $80 of btc on friday. Now the price keeps going down. If I were you I'd wait until about mid day tomorrow. If it comes in around 10k I'd expect a buying frenzy. Especially since a futures contract is listing the buy price at around 16k.

How so? First of I dont own both so I'm defending them as a layman. Dash looks to have a lot of merchant adoption with headway in south America. Neo basically doing the same in Asia. One based on utilizing master nodes the other through proof of stake. Both viable solutions as I only care about a transaction being valid or not. Grant is I consider dash more of a currency than a platform as neo, but that can change through updates so negligible point. Just to add I'm not saying dont hold bitcoin. For fucks sake nothing else would exist without btc. Lol

I think that volume is going to be a big factor. Each sector; platforms, currencies, and protocols will all fight to get the most adoption. More adoption results in higher volume which will shift rankings. But as far as being trusted bitcoin will always remain  Even if it over taken the scarcity factor comes into play which will drive the price up dramatically.

His prediction as stated multiple times it based on what the last bitcoin to be mined will be worth. In that sense his 1 mil perdiction is based on 2 factor imo.

Right. So right now not all coins are in circulation. What I'm saying is by that point which was I think 2025 or 2035 the maximum value is reached. But before then someone who has a single coin by mid next year is essentially work free for at least 15 years in a matter of 5 years. And At 2k a month with no asset debt is well off for a single person. Even if rate of inflation is 4%. Now If you took that 15 year figure in a first world country it can be extended to 30 in a 2nd world. Not bad.

Silver and gold run the same bots. Look at the 10yr charts for proof. Otherwise just trust me. Either usd burns to hell via inflation and interest rate hikes or we go through a normal ath high after the halving. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:53:57
Every time it goes further down I want more coins and tokens. I'm thinking 10 years into the future. Sorry can't compete with btc billionaires. But hey I can easily make a quarter billion in 10 years if I think of my alts in btc value. Then extrapolate my btc value to usd. 
Imo in a few years after USD pairs to coins and tokens is the day we see the divergence. USD will be more popular than btc. Probably strong alt market but eventually btc will inevitably be what makes alts cost more. So more alts I have bigger chance I get a higher btc value.

Well seeing as how gravitational waves were discovered 3 years ago we might be too far off from time travel. Maybe like 100 more years. 500 to be more realistic. Plus last I checked even the us space navy doesn't have the tech to make faster than light travel so that's out. I'd like to be optimistic on the cancer thing but unless big phara controls cybernetic implants then cancer is still more profitable. Btc is probably the most realistic perdiction made. Aside from Trump winning because that's just given at this point.

Imo this month we will be back to around 18k. 
1. Better entry point for hedge funds is being established
2. Bear trend is broken in technicals even with low volume
3. Most people will get their tax money this month
4. major alt coins will be releasing alpha versions this month or next month
5. Big conferences taking place next month

2 methods. 
Buy btc and transfer to a mixer or pay the fees and transfer from coinbase to a DeX then out to a wallet before you transfer it to that place. No one gives a shit about some 20 dollar purchase. Anything above that and you should go to /darknets

15% of banks fail, 70% succeed and consolidate the failed banks under their branches. The lost 15% goes to coins or tokens aimed at working with banks. Btc and others take or grow the market shares of their respective verticals.

Sorry I don't use localbitcoins. I think much will depend on the next 6 to 8 months. More laws and more regulations will have a big impact. Either way 1 btc will always be 1 btc.

So you lost money on your initial investment. This is no different than stocks. You think anyone in 2016 thought btc would go to 20k. Probably but it was a few people who were called stupid. This is your investment and unless you dumped 100k on btc you shouldn't think you can retire next year. you need to wait. Drink a beer and make sure your coins or not an exchange or on your phone.

I used to work at a PC shop that sent drives to clean rooms for data recovery. Hate to say it but I agree with the others you'll probably not get anything useful after using the drive. If you do want to try youd probably spend around 500 just for them to do initial analysis.

Not selling. I worked my ass off to move from poverty to low-middle class. Fuck if I waste my last chance to finally move up one more time. Lambo, no bills, and cal travel the world. 3 years nothing when I spent 10 years in higher education.

Buy a house or property to diversify. Find a realtor and tell them to find you someone selling property for btc. You'll have to pay taxes either way on capital gains but it's easier moving larger sums of money like that.

Bitcoin is like stocks. Hey buy apple it's this thing called a computer. No not everyone will get rich but sure as shit enough will get wealth beyond possible means in their life time. And that is enough for me personally. I cannot imagine going to work everyday just so I can pay school loans. Fuck. If I did even make a million I'd reinvest for even longer term. Then pay off all my school debt equal to a damn house and then buy a house. Then I'd go be a professor at MIT or some engineering job at NASA. Grant it not everyone wants to work but I'm sure there are plenty who would also be okay day trading when they know they have several tens of thousands in the bank. So you tell me if bitcoin can't give people hope then What? Tell me to put money in my bank and wait to hit 75, so I can die knowing I watched YouTube videos of people doing the things I want to do.

I always found hitbtc to be the best to use but then again it is more expensive that the other major ones. Main reason why I like it is because of the UI in dark theme. Crypto-bridge is pretty nice too but haven't bought anything from there. Idex was the biggest pain in the ass but has the cheapest token prices.

My thoughts in a list for easy reading
1. Robots can grow food
2. Excess heat from mining create a greenhouse effect
3. We barely breached early adoption
4. Money has to be created relative to population growth
5. Tech promotes global growth
6. Rich is relative to your geographic location and investment 
7. Yes it will dip and everyone is upset including me
8. It's going to go back up
9. Except new investors no one cares about dips except when it extends the profit margins 
10. Unlike forex you can keep holding and now most will hold to relative 0 or moon

3 to 6 more months and we are well above 20k. OTC market is not able to hold the demand. Exchanges currently mainly trade derivatives. Hence high volume low price. Would not be surprised that 20k btc is breached before litecoin halving. 100k or more per btc before that halving. 2018 could have been exponential but it was stopped. USMCA has a section on cross border payments but its ambiguous for a reason.

If your wife divorced you because of a bad financial mistake then she was looking for an excuse. This was bound to happen at some point which I'm sorry to say. If anything she should have realized it could have been her in your shoes. But since she couldn't step back and think of that then hind sight will be a bitch for her. If she is taking the kids it's only a shitty terrible but truly a temporary problem. 
As far as the coins you have. If it were me I'd only sell whatever you absolutely need to, so as to pay bills. Market may go lower until BAKKT and full regulation comes. Everything is pointing to the end of feburary 2019. Everything that has value will go up from there. Could be 10% a day or something ridiculous. Know one knows.

Doubt. 1 mill today might be worth 500,000 after a crash not 10. If its 10 you better have a gun with bullets because you're not getting food without it.
