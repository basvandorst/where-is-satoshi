What's a good alternative to kraken for europe now? With SEPA wires and fast account validation?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:53:41
Remindme! 60 days
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:50:25
It was probably made as a monolithic application
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:50:39
Can you develop? Why is leasing so bad?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:58:51
about 600 btc on kraken
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:12:24
Why is a wall of 1000 BTC a big deal? I see walls of 700 btc get eaten up on Kraken daily, surely 300 btc more is no big deal.
If I saw 10k btc or 100k btc wall then I'd be worried.

Can you explain why you think this won't last? Looks like it will last to me with those ASICs
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:51:58
Looks like transactions are clearing though right now, maybe in 48 hours everything will be back to normal.

This is why I boot from a fresh ubuntu live cd every time I need to access an exchange or access my encrypted wallet...
I'm sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:01:15
I checked again and it's up to 750 btc, so yeah not sure it will be tonight.

Sometimes I wonder what the fuck I'm doing in this sub, reading comments like this
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:06:46
But everyone uses 7-zip no?
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:45:34
Well, the idea is to sell at 100$, buy back in at 50$, sell at 300$ etc but good luck with that...
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:17:34


Can you elaborate on this?

wait, btg is out?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:47:04
No friction, just by moving it around a bit while planting it it keeps moving.

This man speaks the truth
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:18:48
What's up with their prices though? Do they charge double price for everything?
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:33:28


wtf really? I thought moving BTC would be safe (as in you only risk to lose the S2X coins) but moving S2X coins can make you lose your BTC, no?
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:48:38
Wtf, why is bitcoin cash getting a hardfork? The hell I thought this scamcoin is over
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:30:36
This is why I always say market cap means nothing but nobody understands.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:20:19
Can you elaborate? What made the fees go so high? I thought it was just the bitcoins going up in price making the fees also go up since the fees are in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:32:40
Classic reverse bart pattern
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:50:10
There might be one this one weekend because of ongoing BCH pump/shilling, if there isn't just go and buy
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:28:40
Market Cap literally means nothing
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:59:55
Ok, but If I hold everything, I'm safe? What about if I move my btc after the fork? Do I stand to lose just my B2X or also my BTC?
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:12:04
Came here for these comments, not disappointed.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:11:58
Market cap doubles when the value doubles true, but the number obtained by multiplying number of coins by value means little imo because as soon as people start buying or selling the value moves in the other direction faster, billions in market cap can just as easily fizzle out.

Where should we go? What's a good exchange with better hardware?

Is ther source code for this? I would like to optimize it for GPU rendering. Seems heavily limited by the CPU right now.

The point of bitcoin is that it's trust-less
