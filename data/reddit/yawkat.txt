The ECB made the best decisions during the crisis and denying that would be ignorant of the situation.

Well, a major difference is that with bitcoin you can't just set the interest rates because you can't give out new money without mining. This is one of the tools we use in the EU to try to combat our crisis right now. Additionally, bitcoin will, even in the long run, be at least at equilibrium between inflation and deflation, making it harder for countries to pay fees for their debts.

Central banks usually don't cause stuff like this. Removing them is not going to solve the issues that Keynes exposed.

I'm not sure if it's actually a good time to buy now or if you expect it to dip lower and you just want the price to stabilize by making people buy.

Yes, I guess there are a lot of similarities between gold as an asset and bitcoin. However, this does not really answer my question: how can we control a market that is based on being uncontrollable or why don't we need to control it?

To do the same thing the ECB is managing to do very well right now: ensuring price stability and trust in the currency.

You need an altruistic entity to control the credit rates to counter negative economic trends.
