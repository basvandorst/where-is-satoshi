I am not here to defend Dubai for anything a racist might write in his free time (this is what I felt in above article you have shared). This guy must be a racist or all ears who never actually visited Dubai himself. Anyway, if you are one of those who decide after what you read on internet. Then here are a few links for you. May be it can change your thoughts. 
And there are 100's others, If you trust more on famous websites, please do your research on wikipedia. Dubai is one the places with least crime rate. Which is as safe as if you are walking in street at 3AM and you are confident that no one will even look at you without a reason (hurting you is far far away). I have been to many places and had different experiences, I won't say which was good or which wasn't because most of the time it's your point of view only. Things are not that complicated. 
Anyway, the topic was about something else, I am sure sooner or later you will start looking for investments in Dubai as something the author has explained in his article can be anything not Dubai. But when the time comes you can have us in your mind for real estate investments.

I would say, coinbase have the worst support team I could ever deal with. They won't reply your institutional application for months and after months they will ask for required documents and once you provide that, no news again for next 6 months, and after 6 months all you will hear is news that "We apologize, Coinbase does not support it's operations in your country". Looks like the only country they support is their own imagination.

No, really not. 1 Bitcoin is 6.5k USD today, 2 days ago it was 5.8K and tomorrow??
We never know if it's going to be 100k or it's going back to 3k or 2k or 1k. It's all about when you feel is the right time to convert it into something more reliable.

Not very good time to convert your coins because of the bitcoin price, I agree. But the property prices in Dubai on other hand are decreased by 10&amp; - 15&amp; comparing to past 3 years. We are expecting an increase by the end of this year or start of next year. In our history with Real Estate business we have done a couple of surveys, I can send you latest survey, in which you can see the decline in property prices and this survey is based on number of transactions published by DLD (Dubai Land Department). 
If you can share an email ID, I can get back to you with the graph we have, which describes market position. 
Yes hype about 2020 is definitely pumping prices, slowly at the moment, more at then end of this year as I said before. 
We are target a gross ROI of 7&amp; - 10&amp; annually for our clients, but it clearly depends on the area property is located in. 
We charge 5&amp; of rental amount for property management (yearly) if it's long term rental. For short term rentals (1 day, 1 week or 1 month) We charge 12&amp; - 20&amp; monthly depends on area again. 
Summary: In my personal opinion anything over 7k for bitcoin is great position to convert it for real estate investments until September / October. After that anything over 8k for bitcoin price will be better as the property prices are definitely going to boost soon. Today it's the buyer's market. Tomorrow it might be seller's.
The best reason for people to invest here is tax. Until 2017 it was the only tax free country (UAE). By the start of 2018 they have imposed a 5&amp; VAT which is still less than any developed country.

We don't hold bitcoins. We are basically registered with a couple dozen exchanges and OTC and have our private BTC dealers. So any amount you are bringing in can be exchanged immediately into fiat and then same day we need you to be here to start property transfer process as Dubai Land Department (DLD).

Wow, that's a horrible news. We have a lot investments sitting in hitbtc, if this is what they are doing to you, they can do that to us too. Will check  if I can get mine out. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:07:19
lol yeah.
@_date: 2018-07-04 09:37:26
No, we don't at least not until we care about our 13 years reputation more than a few coins. lol

Yes, all the prices are being fetched from bitstamp api and our price in AED or USD is being converted. So basically it's the same price that you are paying in fiat currency. Just that we are making it more easy by accepting bitcoins and other cryptos. 
Moreover, it has a lot of privacy options and it is a solution for those individuals:
Say you want to buy a villa for 4 million AED in dubai, but you have bitcoins. If you don't see bitcoin as payment option what you can go is go to exchange (OTCs are super expensive) and withdraw your money. On most exchanges there is a limit that you can withdraw 1 bitcoin per day (using your verified individual account). Withdrawing 4 million can take months. 
Much easier if you find a way to pay directly in bitcoins. And reliable if you see a company accepting it is licensed.

Right, I will be more honest on this. At the moment the bitcoin price is down. I personally think this is not the best time to sell your bitcoins (or exchange them for anything). But again. If it's above 7k - 8k and your purchase price is lower. Then switching it to passive income (which you will get by further renting your property after buying it, ofcourse we do that too) is a great choice.
We are closing small deals almost every other week even in these months for 2 reasons.
1. Bitcoin price can go down and they don't want to lose value. So they prefer converting it here when it's not too high not too low. 
2. Dubai real estate market is down, something you would buy for a million dollars 2 years back, you can buy it for like 800k now. And Dubai is currently the best place to invest and no one has to debate on it. So people are buying it and then renting it. And they stay in their country (UK / US / NZ) and receiving rental payments in their banks. ( Yes we do property management too, to take care of all that). 
So now, it's really your own choice, depends on the price you bought bitcoins for, and when you want to exchange them.
