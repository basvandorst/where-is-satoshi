Which is why it would be revolutionary for finance. Also, I would consider anything under 5 seconds to be practically instant.

Regardless, I still think $3.10 is high and in my mind one of the beauties of crypto is very fast transaction times. Can we get a coin that can verify instantly and have low or no fees? I think so. I hope so. Otherwise, there will be no crypto revolution. Just maybe a crypto backbone that retrofits the existing infrastructure.
I hope OP finds new coins that can keep carrying on the torch!

Buying low selling high is the only proven way to make money in Bitcoin

I believe that you report the gains of 20, but then also deduct the losses of 60. Still comes out to net -40 and you deduct that from your income.
The gov't isn't *that* greedy...

If you're in the US, you'll have to start with Coinbase most likely and then transfer to other exchanges of you want to buy other coins

Buy low, sell high

No but what I think circansm is trying to say is what would Bitcoin's intrinsic value be based on the industries it's able to disrupt. 
E.g. remittances: you must pay a fee to a company like Western Union to transfer money across borders. Determine how much money Western Union makes off of this (and all of their competitors) and add that to Bitcoin's underlying value. Since WU is a public company, this could probably be done by looking at their annual reports.
Then you could compare this total value to it's actual value and have a rough idea if BTC is over or undervalued.

This might be trivial, but are you sure it QC and not QT?
Anyways, to export a private key from your bitcoin-qt client:
launch your bitcoin client as usual and wait for it to start loading the blockchain
click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right)
click on 'debug window'
select the 'console' tab
type: walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600
type: dumpprivkey [your Bitcoin address here]
this will return the private key, you can copy it now; ensure you clear your clipboard/history afterwards
Then you can download a new wallet (I recommend electrum or coinomi) and sweep that private key to retrieve your coins.

Give them LTC instead.

Consolidation of the mining hash power into the hands of a few large farms (see 51% attack), slow transaction speed that will continue to get worse with scale (lightning network is under development as a solution here), high transaction fees which make bitcoin infeasible for small, every day purchases (see atomic swaps and also lightning network again), and always a looming threat of US gov't intervention (imo wouldn't be able to kill bitcoin, but would send the price spiraling)
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:04:42
You can extract your private keys and then sweep them to a new wallet. It is a little strange that your balance is saying 0 though. Did you actually fire up the same download from before or download QC again?
@_date: 2018-09-03 01:48:54
Yes please focus on how this will affect price and let me know how to profit off this
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:43:26
I think you're hitting the nail on the head. Bitcoin is not viable for everyday use. It's best shot at everyday use will be if the Lightning Network is implemented or atomic swaps allow the everyday use to be settled on a lower fee blockchain. e.g. coins like LTC.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:40:38
Hmmm, doesn't sound good. Have you still been downloading the blockchain? Have your BTC showed up in your balance yet?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:40:28
If you still are having trouble, the easiest way I could help out would probably be team viewer or something. I realize my instructions up top came out in a paragraph which is hard to follow. I'll post again here:
to export a private key from your bitcoin-qt client: 
1) launch your bitcoin client as usual and wait for it to start loading the blockchain 
2) click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right) click on 'debug window' 
3) select the 'console' tab type: walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600 
4) type: dumpprivkey [your Bitcoin address here] this will return the private key, you can copy it now
Once you have the private key, you can 'Sweep' this to any wallet.

It wasn't, but during my investigation into this several people have mentioned that. Thanks for the heads up it all worked out in the end just took a loooooooooong time.

Yeah it said my funds were there after 1 confirmation but didn't show them until after 3 confirmations
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:56:34
I did that and got a real quick, helpful response. Thanks for the help!

25% if you hedl under a year and 15% if longer than a year. The percentages are only applied to the gains

Due to tx fees I wouldn't suggest buying a coffee with bitcoin either. Due to the tx times I would also argue it isn't feasible.
Full disclosure: I am an investor in LTC so take this with that grain of salt, but I think it is much more viable as a store of value.

You're right. It should actually read "... didn't feel they were viable". Interestingly though, as a native English speaker I read it and understood what they meant without second thought

No the app isn't giving me any info. I'm thinking that is just messed up until the tx is confirmed. With 4 ricochets and a tor tx I'm thinking it might take awhile
