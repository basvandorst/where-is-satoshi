You can do that but there's no strong need to, all that matters is that your transactions eventually make it to a miner so they can include them in a block. The benefit a full node offers to users is confirmation of incoming transactions for the user.

I don't mean to present this as a false dichotomy but would you rather have a billion people use URLs and a few million get phished or would you rather have a million people using IP addresses and no one get phished? Point being that the net gain in terms of # of people using the system properly will go up if you improve the UX. The real alternative to names isn't fingerprints. It's people not checking fingerprints or not even encrypting/authenticating. Note that I'm not saying fingerprints are bad - it's the best we've had, and I still check fingerprints today. Blockstack is just one way to improve the UX of checking fingerprints.
It seems we're at an impasse, maybe Blockstack or some other company interested in this will do a usability study so we can get empirical data and put the debate to rest. Until then, we only have our subjective preferences and instincts to guide us.
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:23:32
Yes it is not necessary, but it is easier (for me, anyway) to write and remember a name than a long number like a PGP key fingerprint. It is just a simpler, more familiar user experience.
@_date: 2016-08-23 17:20:08
Think of an app like Signal. Every time the user gets a new phone or has to reinstall the app for any reason, they have to re-verify their fingerprint with all of their contacts. If you have dozens or hundreds of contacts on Signal, this is extremely laborious to the point of annoyance - I'd wager to say most users in this situation probably wouldn't actually verify with all contacts. But if the Signal fingerprint was linked to a blockchain ID, and all contacts saved the blockchain ID and verified with that, then this fingerprint verification ritual wouldn't be necessary every time.
@_date: 2016-08-22 06:29:42
You're not going to have all smart contracts (D) executing on the Bitcoin blockchain. That just does not scale. Most bitcoin transactions will happen off-chain, on a sidechain or some other off-chain system, using the Bitcoin blockchain to checkpoint their state and settle transactions every so often.

This is automatic, just run the full node software and, if programmed correctly, it will do all the work for you.

Blockstack transactions are valid transactions that conform to all of the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. These transactions are no more spam than [bible verses]( or [newspaper headlines](
EDIT: I wouldn't say it solves the problem 100% but it moves the needle closer by providing a secure channel for broadcasting hashes and key updates, a channel that anyone can access just by knowing to look up "bitcoincore.id" with a Blockstack client.

I change my PGP key about once per year, but my blockchain ID has been the same since 2014. If you had known and trusted that ID since then, you never would have had to re-verify my PGP key. Much better UX for encrypted/authenticated messaging then having to re-verify every time I change keys.

The insurance was introduced for good reasons:
I'm not saying that OB can't be used for homesharing. I'm saying that it's premature to do so until there are more protections for guests and hosts. Yes, there are steps that both sides can take right now to do due diligence to try and minimize risk - do skype interviews, require a security deposit and references, ask for a video tour of the location, only host friends or friends of friends, etc - but to really become a widespread use-case as popular as Airbnb itself, more rigorous protections are needed. I'll be excited to use the service when these protections are in place.

That is a live blockchain ID registered on the Bitcoin blockchain. It contains the SHA1 hash of the SHASUMS file for Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 and the latest PGP signing key of Wladimir J. van der Laan, both pulled from bitcoin.org.

You don't have to send transactions through a particular node, but you would check the blockchain history of a particular node for transaction confirmations. This is possible by just knowing the node's IP address.

What OB currently lacks that makes Airbnb trustworthy is insurance. Unless a reputable third party company is willing to insure p2p homesharing transactions then it's unlikely this will become a widespread use-case for OB.
An alternative to insurance could be for the renter and homeowner to both put up security deposits with a neutral third party who can moderate disputes, but these deposits would have to be prohibitively large to cover all the possible damages that could arise.
In time, these issues could be ironed out but I don't think it is a good idea to do this today.
@_date: 2016-04-29 23:11:26
OB's app framework could be used but it doesn't have the order book functionality like an exchange needs. Think of the difference between Bitstamp and Amazon. Different apps for different purposes.

There's no need to compensate for lost coins. Lost coins do nothing to hamper the utility of the system (aside from the inconvenience to the individual users who lose coins, which inflation doesn't help), and "compensating" with inflation actually ensures debasement of the remaining supply of coins.

One of the problems I have found is that most services, even the ones that say they "support segwit" are not supporting withdrawals to segwit bech32 addresses.

Bitseed co-founder here :) thanks for buying a node! What OS are you on?
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:45:03
I don't believe it will have a huge effect on fees. In fact miners may make even more in fees, because this efficiency increase will allow even more transactions to fit in each block. So they could end up making the same or more fees-per-tx (depending on demand) and increased fees-per-block as a result. Either way I see no reason for them to hold it up.

Open the terminal app. Type "ifconfig | grep broadcast | arp -a" without the quotes and press enter. One of the IP addresses on your network should be the Bitseed. Copy the address and paste it into your browser with :81 added at the end; it should look like "10.1.10.160:81". If you aren't sure which device on your network is Bitseed keep trying the different IP addresses on your network until the Bitseed web app opens in your browser. Then you should be able to use the documentation that shipped with your node to navigate and use the web app. Let me know if you run in to any other issues!

The coinbase subsidy halves every 210,000 blocks. Eventually it runs out completely. Miners will rely entirely on transaction fees when the subsidy runs out, and likely long before then unless the price continues to increase to keep fiat-denominated revenues net-same over time. Fees are incredibly important to the sustainability of bitcoin's security.

Not "zero counterparty risk" but pretty close. If you can't post a transaction to the blockchain to prove that you own a certain amount of bitcoin then the party with whom you have an open channel could take all of the funds in the channel. This is an edge case, and if you choose your channel counterparties wisely should never be an issue even under adverse conditions on the blockchain. But still a possibility that makes the risk "non-zero".

Hard forks take a long time to gain consensus and deploy to the entire network.

I know of at least one way they could build their app on the Bitcoin blockchain and benefit from the security of Bitcoin's hashpower. They could use [Blockstore]( to create a blockchain ID for the content, attach the hash of a [zone file]( to the ID which contains additional metadata such as the file name, a description, and a pointer for where to find the actual content, then use the blockchain to find the zone file and Blockstore's DHT (or IPFS, any content-addressable storage will do) to store and access the zone file. This way all you need to put in the blockchain is a small, unique ID and a hash, then you can find the content as long as you know the ID and some DHT node is hosting the metadata and content. I've explained this to people at both of these projects and I hope that they reconsider their use of altcoins since Bitcoin provides a much more solid foundation for building decentralized blockchain applications.

This passage would seem to indicate that one of the most worthwhile things Bitcoin supporters can do is to make it so that advocating the destruction of Bitcoin would be political suicide for any bureaucrat or politician. Unfortunately, the countries which would be most capable of attacking Bitcoin in this manner are also countries that seem the most hostile to freedom in general, particularly freedom of association, speech, and transaction. Many political representatives and government agents in the Five Eyes/ NATO/ BRICS seem dangerously comfortable with openly advocating censorship, crypto backdoors, and mass surveillance. This hostility must be loudly and publicly condemned, its purveyors "tarred and feathered" in the court of public opinion and replaced with more honorable individuals (if not eliminating such positions of power completely in order to eliminate the threat of future attacks). Are "We the People" capable of this, or will we continue to be outmaneuvered and outgunned by opponents of freedom in the fight for liberty and justice for all?

You're right, **required** is more accurate than "allowed." The balance of these excess reserves is historically higher now than it has been in the past. The intention was that banks would lend this money out, stimulating the economy. This has, in reality, [not been the case]( 


The rate of inflation and the supply of currency are synonymous. My original point still stands.


I never suggested it has. 


If [Shadowstats'] ( methodology is to be trusted, it's quite higher than that. But yes, still not hyperinflation due to the banks having historically high excess reserves and not flooding the market with FRNs.


GDP has been going up but so has government spending which is factored into GDP, so the jury's still out as to whether or not things are actually getting better, and if they are, if it's sustainable. Many other indices of economic growth, such as unemployment, are not improving at similar rates, and some economists have reason to believe we are in [yet another]( housing bubble. 
I want things to get better, I really do. IMHO this can only happen if the State stops forcefully intervening in the economy and allows the market to correct itself. This does not mean remove all safety nets and guardrails, it means stop *forcing* people into such programs the way the government forces people into one-size-fits-all regulatory regimes, entitlement programs, and monetary policies. Let bad actors naturally fail and good actors naturally succeed. Don't pick winners and losers, or break our legs and then hand us a crutch expecting us to be grateful. I'm really not asking for much except to be treated as an adult capable of making my own decisions about how to allocate my hard-earned resources.


I was saying that if someone doesn't like having a central bank - that can manipulate the markets at will - in control of the economy, then those alternative systems might be more appealing.
Cheers :)

The second half of the answer is what is relevant - the people who were getting MITM'd using Tor to access the .com weren't noticing, so they figured those same people wouldn't notice whether or not the .onion was correct, hence the SSL cert.

I have not seen any on the mainstream MOOC sites that focus on usability but you're probably right that there are other guides out there. This would be one more marketing avenue for bitcoin and bitcoin education, so contributors to the crowdfunding campaign not only receive a product but help promote bitcoin on mainstream platforms too. 


Bitcoin is new, and there are a lot of ways to do it wrong. I want to set people on the right track if they are going to try to use bitcoin to store value as opposed to just using it to build apps or tip people online.


You are right about that which is why I wasn't expecting to bring in $60K+ but rather just meet a modest goal of $2k. Bitcoin itself is an emerging field so maybe if someone's interest is sparked by the course they would decide to go deeper and make a career of it.


Bitcoin has a ton of advantages to the end user that I'm sure I don't need to mention here, but private transactions, borderless payments, fast value transfer, trustless value storage, and having "programmable money" are all benefits worth knowing about I think. 
Thanks for your feedback, I really appreciate the reality check!

Xapo is issuing a debit card that can be loaded with BTC. To the best of my knowledge they are not selling BTC via credit card payments.
Circle is accepting credit card payments but only after the customer undergoes a stringent KYC process, which is a) necessary to comply with regulations and b) covers them in case of "friendly" fraud. 
This machine, on the other hand, does not (to the best of my knowledge) verify the identity of the person paying with a credit card. This opens the purchase up to chargeback fraud.

No I don't think that it is kind of a big problem. People can use cold storage or multisig to protect their keys from hackers, neither of which requires the user to use a password. They can use a password manager to generate strong passwords if they want to encrypt their keys. And they can use a hardware wallet if they just want the simplest ease of use + security combo.

Unlicensed Money Transmitter / Money Services Business


He said in his letter to the judge that he sold his "business to one of the many much larger brokers in that realm." Perhaps it was a localbitcoins account which a) logged all his IP address logins and b) had a history that was used against him.


Well, it starts with not doing something that's illegal. Let's imagine though that instead of being arrested for doing something illegal, he were just kidnapped at home by a gang of thieves who wanted to steal his bitcoins. How would he avoid this? He would a) use Tor or a VPN to access his online bitcoin trading accounts so as to conceal his home IP address in case sophisticated hackers took over his account b) use a pseudonym both online and in person c) obscure his physical appearance when doing trades because cameras / recognition d) only meet with other trusted traders in public places, making sure not to be followed home.
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:44:18
An assertion like that applies to Dogecoin as much as it applies to Bitcoin. If bitcoin isn't used for daily transactions it will only be due to the tax policy which treats it as a commodity and not a currency. Functionally, as a transactional medium of exchange, bitcoin works fine. Even moreso if bitcoin becomes "more stable than gold, more stable than national currencies." But currently the tax system in the US, which applies equally to Dogecoin and Bitcoin, forces users to calculate gains and losses on every exchange or risk penalties. That is overly-burdensome, relegating by fiat all cryptocurrencies to "store of value" rather than "medium of exchange" status in the US unless the user is willing to do all the proper accounting. Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:48:22
yeah but using different websites doesn't necessarily make your internet less secure. Every other block chain that is not Bitcoin is arguably less secure than Bitcoin because they have less hashing power/ power is more concentrated i.e. PoS coins.

Yeah, all of us in the USA, including the people who don't have bank accounts and don't care to subsidize other people's mistakes


Trezor. Cold storage. Paper wallets. Trusted Execution Environments. 


BitPay, Coinbase, et al confirm transactions more or less instantly. 


Who died and made you spokeperson for the "mainstream consumer"? 


Glad to hear you've never had assets frozen or seized, or your account randomly closed. 


If your savings are denominated in dollars, the Federal Reserve's printing spree does effect your life. You are paying the inflation tax whether you like it or not. Fed printing also helps finance endless war, domestically and abroad. Maybe that doesn't affect your life, but it affects a lot of others. 


Now you're conflating bitcoin the currency with Bitcoin the payment network. I can't tell which you're arguing against. 


A lot less than has been scammed out of the fiat system in the same amount of time, probably even if we measured per-capita of each system.


Kinda inconvenient (typing all that info), kind insecure (man-in-the-middle? keyloggers? fraud resulting from these insecurities is inconvenient to deal with), kinda inflexible (micropayments not possible). 


No you can't. Plenty of countries are completely blocked from global payment networks. And the forex fees make everywhere else that isn't domestic relatively expensive.


Nice strawman, because OP actually didn't say anything like that. 


There is a limited amount of BTC that will ever exist.


Paste address / scan QR / tap NFC device, enter amount, press send. Seconds. 


Once a transaction is confirmed it is secure. I think giving people the option to secure their own money in a way that is superior to the physical security necessary for securing precious metals or cash is much better than not having that option at all. As I said above, cold storage is easy and manageable enough. 


Bitcoin isn't as idiot-proof as a credit card but it isn't rocket science either. 


You must be new around here. Yes BTC is down from its 100x 2013 price explosion, but is up ~10x its Q1 2013 price and ~4x its Q2 2013 price. Price volatility, including long "down-trends" is not new (see: 2011 - 2012) The underlying technology itself *has* evolved e.g. multisig, payments protocol, sidechains, HD wallets, etc. 


You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin to get in on the action :) and the whole market is worth about $5 Billion right now. 


Try reading the sentence you were quoting again - OP is referring to price volatility, not chargebacks. Price volatility can be managed with services like Locks or derivatives for hodlers, and payment processors handle volatility for merchants. 
Happy trolling!

The same could be said of mining, except the consequences of concentrated mining nodes are actually meaningful.

Background story: for the past two years I have been professionally teaching people about bitcoin online and in-person. About a month ago I saw [an article]( about an entrepreneur who raised over $60,000 on Kickstarter pre-selling access ot his Udemy course called "How to make a freaking iPhone app." After reading about his story, I thought to myself, "what a great way to expose a more mainstream audience to bitcoin while giving them all the knowledge they need to have the best experience using it. I'll teach a Udemy course and pre-sell access on Kickstarter!" 
Well, Kickstarter didn't work out (you can read why [here]( it's a relevant story that in itself tells why bitcoin is awesome) but I did manage to setup an Indiegogo campaign, where I have so far raised over 10% of my $2000 goal. If r/bitcoin can help me hit $1000 in the next two days, I have a shot at getting on Indiegogo's "Trending" page, where a lot more people will see the campaign thus making it much more likely to be successful. 
If you think the online course and companion e-book + zine is an effective outreach tool for bitcoin, please help me reach my goal and prove to the world that people want freedom via cool technology just as much as they want "to make a freaking iPhone app." Also, any feedback you have on how I can make the campaign page better is welcome and appreciated :) 
TL;DR please help me raise $1000 in the next two days so I can trend on Indiegogo, exposing a new audience to bitcoin and giving them the knowledge they need to "be their own bank."

When the Fed "prints" USD, they are affecting both the supply and price of credit. The USD is loaned to banks at the Fed rate. A more detailed explanation is portrayed in [this informative video](


No money is being taken but value is. You and I (if we're both American) have a limited choice of participating in the Federal Reserve system. FRNs/ USD has "legal tender" status meaning we must pay our taxes in the currency, and as such, virtually all businesses must accept USD as payment so they can cover their tax liability. Thus, when the Fed "prints" FRNs and devalues all existing FRNs, we are unwillingly paying the "inflation tax." While not outright theft, it's a bit like a neighbor trashing their house and lawn, bringing out down surrounding houses value. It's kind of a dick move.


This is partially due to the [excess reserves]( that banks have been allowed to keep on the books. There are [other causes]( as well, which I will let you read up on at your leisure.


Hyperinflation, by definition, is simply a hyper-increase in the supply of currency, or excessive "printing" by central banks. If the economy cannot absorb the new currency quick enough, prices will rise to compensate for the fact that people suddenly have a lot more money to spend on a relatively inelastic supply of goods and services (simple economic law of supply and demand at work here). This leads to civil unrest when the people who were naive/ foolish enough to save their wealth as fiat currency watch their savings lose value by the hour, and take to the streets to express their anger (see: Argentina or Depression-era Germany).  


The person whose comment you are referring to didn't make the meme, so conflating their explanation with the message behind the meme is a bit of a straw man. The Fed printing money wasn't a trend that magically started with TARP and QE, it has been an ongoing theme since the Fed [first came into existence]( (note that big plunge at the beginning, what could have caused that??). Additionally, why would banks write loans to people they knew couldn't afford to pay them back unless they felt there was some safety net in place? Who would bail them out when those subprime mortgages went bust? Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Community Reinvestment Act are all culprits here, but let's not let the Fed off too easily; they're [not completely innocent]( in this most recent debacle. In fact, because of how tightly intertwined they are with the economy, they inherently share part of the blame whenever the economy goes south (after all if they [did their job]( everything would be just peachy, right?). For anyone who doesn't like that, maybe a Federal Reserve system isn't for you and something like Bitcoin (or something more abstract like [mutual credit]( might be a more appealing system.
EDIT: This is coming from the person who made this meme and [put it on Twitter]( to celebrate Bitcoin's birthday.

It's like cash, you can choose to bury it in a box in the middle of the woods and not tell anyone OR you can plot the location on a map and then cut that map up in such a way that 2 out of 3 pieces are needed to reassemble it and find the location of the box should something happen to you. You give one piece to your best friend, another piece to your lawyer, and another piece to your next of kin. If you die, your lawyer contacts those people to execute your will. Just replace "box in the middle of the woods" with "block chain," and "map" with "private keys." 
And of course you can always put your cash in a bank and let them "take care of it" for you, in which case you should be using Coinbase but don't be surprised when they interrogate you and/ or freeze your money.

The only full nodes that matter as far as consensus is concerned are economic full nodes.   


If miners were all running BU and the rest of the full nodes were running not-BU, then it would be a problem only if the miners were producing blocks that were out of consensus with the rest of the network. This would cause a hard fork and split the blockchain.  
If miners were all running segwit nodes and the rest of the network were running BU, then it would not necessarily be a problem because segwit is a softfork that is designed to be backwards compatible (non-segwit nodes will accept segwit blocks). However, non-segwit nodes will not be able to verify the validity of transactions in segwit blocks since non-segwit nodes would not know where to find the signatures. So for individual nodes it might be a problem but for the network as a whole it would not. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 05:00:56
Nodes do not determine whether or not SegWit is activated. Only miners do. These number actually don't mean much at all.

I would argue that while difficult, getting consensus for a Bitcoin HF is totally doable with enough lead time and legwork.

Hi CTSlicker, I'm a co-founder of Bitseed, thank you for your interest! aficionado2 answered some of your questions very well, but I'll add some more info for you where I think it may be helpful.


The main way that people interact with their node - if ever - is through the Web UI. All you need is the node's internal IP address to access the Web UI from any web browser that's connected to the same network.  
You can see screenshots of the Web UI [here](  


Yes, this will be fine.  


It is variable. We have added controls in the UI that let you put a daily cap on bandwidth.  


It is actually a different board than a Pi, but yes power is negligible. About 10w.  


We like to think so! The only modification we make to the base board is adding the Bitseed UI, scripts, and Bitcoin Core, and we add a unique admin password to every node so that they're harder to hack (you can of course change this password from the command line if you want).  


If you're concerned about blockchain growth, I recommend getting one with the biggest hard drive we have to offer, which is currently 2TB. This will last for years of blockchain growth at the current block size limit.  
Let us know if you have any other questions!

Yes, if a merge-mined chain is to succeed then the sidechain developers will have to cut deals with a majority of the hashrate and hope that the miners hold up their end of the deal. Rootstock does have an interesting method for trying to align these incentives properly, we'll have to see how it works out in practice. My gut feeling is that a consortium model will be the more successful method of securing sidechains since that kind of agreement would be easier to enforce - we'll see!

You can buy one and run it at your home or office:
The incentive is that you don't have to trust a third party to verify your transactions or other data you'd like to access from the blockchain. Also if you are invested in the long-term success of Bitcoin then you have an incentive to ensure that it keeps working, and running a full node with port forwarding is one easy way to do that.

segregated witness changes the way that blocks are built. among other things, it solves some problems with bitcoin that make it more difficult to build "layer two" protocol like lightning network.  
lightning network is a layer two protocol that allows bitcoin users to create a network of bi-directional payment channels and perform ~instant off-chain transactions through these channels. using lightning will reduce pressure on the blockchain while enabling much more transaction capacity (limited only by the number of channel open and channel close transactions that can fit in the blockchain).

You're right, there's not much significance to the mempool size on this one server. Bitcoin Core 0.12 [implemented]( a mempool limiting feature, it's possible this server is running that software and has the limit set low (it still shows &lt;4 MB mempool).

I would argue that it is unproductive to frame the discussion as "big blocks vs small blocks." Instead, I have [suggested]( that the discussion be framed as "proposals that break bitcoin's key innovation vs proposals that do not break bitcoin's key innovation." I think everyone here is concerned about preserving bitcoin's key innovation - a decentralized solution to the double-spending problem - and so that is the benchmark which all proposals should be measured against. Small block vs big block is an oversimplification of the issue imho.

The buyer puts 2x into escrow (1x bond, 1x sale price), and the seller puts 1x into escrow. This system probably wouldn't be suitable for very expensive items (where the bond is prohibitively expensive) or very cheap items (where the bond isn't large enough to discourage DoS attacks), but for sales between $50 - $1000 it could make sense if the buyer and seller don't have any better options.

One clarification: when royalty distributions are made, your 'share' is X out of Y coins, where Y is the number of "vested" coins that have been awarded for bounties, not necessarily the total number of coins that can be distributed. So for example, on the first distribution in June, if you have 10,000 coins and only 100,000 have been awarded, you will receive 10% of the distribution.
Also, the bounties are up for negotiation ;)

Thanks for the writeup Chris. I think what many people in this thread are missing is that consensus of the economic majority is precisely how Bitcoin works *at all*. It's not about what the miners want, it's not about what full nodes want, it's not even about what devs want, *it's about what the economic majority wants.* If/when there's ever a hardfork, it will be the economic majority that decides which side wins. All a UASF does is put power where it belongs: with the economic majority.

You're right. I think it's a convention leftover from the investment world. When a company incorporates, they're typically granted an initial supply of outstanding stock e.g. 10,000,000 shares. Most will go to the founders, and small chunks will be sold off to investors over time. Shareholders will later vote to dilute themselves by issuing more shares in later rounds if it means their shares still go up in monetary value because the new investment increases the valuation of the company. This doesn't smoothly translate to the Assembly coin model, since founders do not have all of the unvested coins for themselves, and, crucially, the coins can't be sold in a liquidity event.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:06:18
Ok thanks! I'll point out that it's not a given that SegWit will reduce the fees to miners. Several scenarios could result:  
- More tx volume, same average fees = more revenue  
- More tx volume, less average fees = same revenue, or maybe less  
- Same tx volume (miner-selected soft-limit), same fees = same revenue
- Less tx volume, less average fees = less revenue  
(not an exhaustive list)  
Miners are not obligated to create bigger blocks, so they could keep a low soft-limit to keep fee revenues high. We'd still get all of the benefits of segwit minus the on-chain capacity boost.

You're right that it's a cumbersome experience, especially for buying bitcoin at current spot right now. For fiat, this is something people are used to, and the swings aren't as extreme, at least relative to bitcoin. There are outliers sure, but most people chalk it up to the cost of doing business.

When you hedge your wallet balance, Abra is creating coverage for the hedge. If the hedge moves in your favor, and you make a transaction, Abra sends you some bitcoin, as you would expect. Conversely, if the hedge moves against you, and you make a transaction, your wallet is programmed to send Abra some bitcoin, again as you would expect. Abra doesn't "take" anything from you because Abra (the company) does not have access to the private keys to initiate and sign transactions in the wallet on your behalf. If you don't want to use this hedging mechanism for whatever reason, you don't have to hedge your wallet balance, you can go in the menu and change your wallet currency to BTC.

By running a full node you are ensuring the security of all of your own transactions by confirming with your own node that they have been added to the blockchain. You can run a "selfish full node" that does not upload data or you can run a "network full node" that does upload data. Both secure your transactions, but only the latter will provide any public benefit to the Bitcoin network.

So you're saying, it's a soft-fork because segwit blocks would still be backwards-compatible for old nodes, but that if miners chose not to signal then only they (and nonsegwit nodes that accept their blocks) would be participating in a hard fork? I think I understand this better now.

It sounds like there was a problem with the information you submitted to our banking partner.

Tellers can set their own fees, and if they already have a cash-based business then this is now an additional way to make money with the cash that's already in their register. Ideally, a Teller is doing business in a fixed location or area and the transaction cost to them is marginal compared to the fee they're making.

Yes this has been common feedback we get, and we are looking to improve this in an upcoming release. Right now the way it works is that the customer gets the rate at the time the transaction clears. The customer can cancel the transfer at any time up until the point the transfer clears.  
Until we release a better solution, one way you can avoid a "surprise rate" is to set your wallet currency as USD and deposit USD. Once you have the USD in your wallet, you can send the money to an external bitcoin wallet or convert your wallet currency to BTC when the rate is close to what you want. Then the app will show you the rate you'll get when you go to convert the currency from USD to BTC.

Hi OP, thanks for trying out the Abra app and providing your feedback here. We're currently working on improving the "add money" flow in the app so that it's more clear what's happening at each step in the process. Regarding documentation, it's true that Abra's banking partner may ask for additional KYC documentation on a case-by-case basis. However it is not Abra's policy to take funds from your bank account before the transaction has been approved, so we want to clarify that we did not ask for KYC details "after you've sent your money".

The challenge with dispensaries accepting bitcoin is twofold: one, dealing with exchange rate volatility, and two, offloading the coins to pay their bills. Two is actually the easier part, although still not trivial: they could sell the coins via localbitcoins or some other OTC market, or if their vendors (with the exception perhaps of cannabis product manufacturers and distributors, who would be in the same boat as dispensaries) sign up for BitPay or Coinbase, then the vendors can accept bitcoin and withdraw to their bank account. One is a bit trickier, because bitcoin is very volatile in price compared to USD. Here, dispensaries could use a wallet like Abra that lets them accept bitcoin or payments from other Abra customers, and hold USD until they're ready to cash out or pay their vendors using the methods described above.

AFAIK when you make a deposit you are shown that you are receiving the exact amount that's being transferred from your bank e.g. $100 USD.

The reason miners have an economic incentive to mine bitcoin is because someone running a full node will accept their blocks as valid and trade real money, goods, or services for the bitcoins in those blocks. This ["economic majority"]( is really the true source of "consensus" in bitcoin.

I'm familiar with the concept! As a chaotic system, we cannot predict what will happen to demand for block space in Bitcoin and when. Demand could increase or decrease for reasons independent of the block size increase introduced by segwit. Per-tx fees could also go up or down for reasons independent of the block size increase; miners could soft-limit to preserve 1MB blocks and high per-tx fees, or maybe a high-value use-case for the blockchain is found that results in users willing to pay more fees per tx, etc. We just don't know.

It depends on what they did prior to that decision. If their wallet was denominated in USD and their balance was $100, and later the price of bitcoin goes down and they decide to convert their wallet to bitcoin, then they will have $100 worth of bitcoin in their wallet at the time of the conversion.

@_date: 2017-03-16 19:38:02
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:57:24


The blockchain is about 106GB right now, and all Bitseed Core nodes come with a full backup in case of database corruption - so lifetime growth up to today takes up ~212 GB right now. 1TB will probably last another five years at least at current growth rates. That said, the growth rate could change, so the actual time it will last could be more or less depending.  


Upgrading the version of Bitcoin running on the device is as easy as entering our upgrade script using the command line. If you can SSH into the node, you can upgrade your node.  


You can do it yourself, which grandma definitely couldn't do, or you can send it back to us and we'll do it for you.  


Yes.  


Probably not, you'll want a more high-powered node to do that for you.  
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:11:03


WRT to segwit, yes, there is no need to do it at all.  


An independently run, geographically unique full network node (segwit or not) does help a little bit, although there is a point of diminishing returns, and I'm not completely sure whether we've reached it yet or not. In any case, the benefit that such a full node provides to the network is additional censorship-resistance for transactions and blockchain data. Edit: full nodes will also reject invalid transactions and blocks that do not conform to the rules of the protocol as set by your node.

$500/ day for bank transactions. No limits for cash transactions (or rather, these limits are set by the Teller you're doing business with).


Anyone in any of our supported countries can use the app. We also have a merchant API and Master Teller program for merchants and large chain stores that want to get in the business of being Abra Tellers, respectively.  


Your money goes from your wallet, to other wallets, with no middle-man. Abra uses the bitcoin blockchain for all transactions, so it is p2p just like bitcoin is p2p.

No reason it couldn't connect to another node, but then you'd have to trust that that node or group of nodes is not colluding to DoS your wallet.


There could be fall-backs in place that serve as second-best options until your node comes back online e.g. talking to several other trusted nodes that you have selected or the wallet has pre-selected.


There's no reason why this hypothetical wallet wouldn't provide the choice to do either or. We can look at an existing wallet to see how it's done - Schildbach Bitcoin Wallet for Android lets you [choose]( to connect to random SPV nodes or to your own trusted node.

Hi Lee, thanks for giving the app a try! As suggested by other commenters here, it's possible that your wallet currency is still a fiat currency (e.g. AUD) and what happened was that there was a 1% conversion fee to turn your bitcoin into dollars. To avoid this kind of fee for receiving bitcoin in the app, you want to set your wallet currency to BTC using the dropdown in the main menu. Can you confirm whether your Abra wallet currency was set to BTC or a fiat currency when you made the deposit?

There's no way to know if someone is actually using a full node when they send a Bitcoin transaction. It's possible though that a protocol would be developed that pays full nodes to access archival blockchain data, or pays full nodes to relay transactions. Just as mining went from a hobbyist endeavor that could be run "at a loss" due to the small scale to a professional endeavor that's very much "for profit," it's possible that running a full node will also one day go from hobbyist "volunteer, non-profit" endeavor to industrial "professional, for-profit" endeavor.

Open questions if anyone wants to help answer them here :)
- Is there a desktop UI that I can "pair" with the bitcoind + LND node running on my Bitseed so I don't have to SSH into Bitseed and do all this from the command line?
- What kind of monitoring tools are available to make sure that my nodes stay online and don't get force-closed or have my bond seized?
- How do I safely shut down my LND node in a way where I don't risk losing money?
- How do I see and change what mining fee rate is used to open and close LND channels?
- When I opened a channel, I selected 300000 as the amount. However the channelbalance shown after the transaction was confirmed showed 297120. Where did the missing satoshis go?
- How long exactly do users need to wait for channels to open and close before the funds are "free" to spend?
- How do I deal with uncooperative peers or prevent getting robbed by a peer? Does the node handle all of this for me?
- How do I get an incoming channel to my LND node when it is running over Tor?
- How do I backup my channel states from the Bitseed node so that I can recover if the data get corrupted or something?
- I see a lot of action happening in the console when I watch LND while it's running, even though I'm not making any transactions. What is all this data my node is showing?
- Does LND have official, comprehensive usage docs that would answer these questions (and others that I'm sure would come up)? This seems like it would be a useful resource to have vs cobbling together instructions from a bunch of different sources and figuring things out by trial and error, as I did while writing this guide.

My point, which I tried to make clear in the last paragraph of my comment, was that censorship can happen both within the incentive structure of Bitcoin and without needing to become a "trusted third party" that can unilaterally conduct a 51% attack. The point is a bit pedantic but something worth thinking about if your primary interest in Bitcoin is "censorship resistance." The censorship-resistant nature of Bitcoin will be better when there's Zcash levels of obscurity baked into the core protocol (so miners will have a much harder if not impossible time singling out transactions for censorship).

Thanks for the reply!


It seems what Alexandria wants is an alt-blockchain, but not necessarily an altcoin. Alexandria could use a Bitcoin [sidechain]( if you really want a different blockchain. Or you could use something like [Blockstack]( if you want to take direct advantage of the main Bitcoin blockchain's security.


If you use Blockstack, you don't need to make any changes to Bitcoin to support Alexandria today. If you really want a separate blockchain, federated sidechains work today e.g. [Liquid]( and support for DMMS sidechains is being worked on via SegWit and other updates to Bitcoin. Blockstack could suffice until DMMS sidechains are ready if you really want a separate blockchain with its own independent mining network.  


Yes Satoshi did say something like this, when "BitDNS" was first proposed. Blockstack and other meta-layer protocols show that we can build secure decentralized non-financial applications on the Bitcoin blockchain. And if we want to use another blockchain but still use the most widely-adopted cryptocurrency, we can use bitcoin with a sidechain. You gain all of the benefits of bitcoin's massive liquidity and network effect advantages, and still get to work with a blockchain with your own custom rules. What's not to like about that?

What it really comes down to is that I think you should use the bitcoin token natively with your blockchain because it has the biggest network effect and the most liquidity. Then you would have the whole support of the bitcoin community behind you, instead of being seen as an "other" that is competing with bitcoin. Just trade in your flo for a bunch of bitcoins, build a great bitcoin-native app, and you'll benefit just as much if not more when bitcoin goes up in value as you would if flo took off.
You don't have to use the Bitcoin blockchain directly, though that would be a good place to start - you could eventually switch to using a two-way pegged sidechain if the security is comparable to the main Bitcoin blockchain. What matters is that you use the bitcoin token, not an altcoin that dilutes bitcoin's value. For a more thorough explanation of why this would be best, you might be interested in reading [this]( blog post.

Hi there, I was just hired by Abra to help them build out their Teller network. Tellers in the U.S. will check a box basically saying that they are aware of regulations and that the compliance burden is on them.

Ethereum has done several hard forks and only one resulted in a permanent chain split. Many other coins have also done hard forks "without chaos".

There is a risk that we (Bitseed) have tampered with the Bitcoin software on the device to provide false information to users. While we have no incentive to do this unless we intend to double-spend our customers (or are colluding with someone who wishes to double-spend our customers), this is still a risk that some understandably do not want to take. Customers who like our hardware but do not trust the software can perform a factory reset of the device and do a clean OS install and a clean install of Bitcoin Core from a trusted source.

Bitcoin is not really designed for censorship resistance, that is just a convenient by-product of the incentive structure. It was designed to prevent double-spending without the need for a trusted third party. Censorship is not mentioned anywhere in the whitepaper, but Satoshi did explicitly mention double-spending.


Miners can censor a transaction without directly colluding with one another i.e. because the transaction did not pay a high enough fee. The same cannot be said for double-spending, which requires direct collusion.

Note that this is only true if you use your full node to verify all of your transactions. If you are using a wallet that relies on a full node run by a third party, then your wallet will be following whatever rules that are enforced by that third party's full node. And if your full node happens to be enforcing rules on a chain with a minority of hashing power, then you are at extreme risk of reorgs and double-spend attacks.  
"Consensus" is determined by the majority of miners + economic majority of full nodes. Individual full nodes will have little impact on the outcome of a hard fork other than to give their owners control over which side they end up on.

These are valid questions. Bill has talked about the hedge in the past and is planning to do a blog post about how it works "under the hood", until then it's only fair that people speculate if they're really curious about it. Having the user control their private keys is important for Abra not only from a security perspective but a regulatory perspective as well, so I can assure that it is definitely a non-custodial wallet. As for the numbers, as with LBTC it will be up to Tellers to set their own fees. In an ideal world there will be many Tellers that will compete to lower their fees. With enough volume going through from the new markets that Abra opens up it could add up to be a lot of money, even if each tx takes a lower fee than the Teller would have charged for an LBTC tx.

They use Florincoin because they want to store all of the metadata on-chain and Bitcoin can only store 80 bytes of data while Florincoin can store much more than that. Personally I think a better (more scalable and secure) approach would be to use something like [Blockstack]( that stores pointers to the metadata on the Bitcoin blockchain and then stores the actual metadata off-chain. With this model, the clients can parse the blockchain to find the pointers, then use those pointers to find the off-chain metadata, build a local database to search, and then view the library.

Yes. You'll be able to buy and sell bitcoin from within the app via bank account in countries where Abra has bank integrations (US and PH right now, more to come), and if there are Tellers nearby then you'll be able to buy/sell with cash too. Once you have bitcoin in your Abra wallet, you can send it to any other Abra user and they will receive it in the currency of their choice, whether dollars, euros, pesos, bitcoin, etc. So you can pay someone in bitcoin who doesn't even know or care about bitcoin, and they'll receive the currency they're interested in. Of course you'll be able to send the bitcoin to any other bitcoin address too.

I believe you are misunderstanding how Bitmarkets 2-of-2 escrow works. This video explains:   
Buyer puts up 2x deposit into 2-of-2 address, and Seller puts up 1x deposit. They both have an incentive to perform as agreed so that the other party will release the deposit after the transaction is completed. Neither party can profitably defraud the other, or they will lose their deposit. If I am a buyer, I will not sign to release the payment + seller's deposit to the seller if they do not send me the item as expected, and if I'm a seller, I will not sign to release the buyer's deposit to them if they don't sign to release the payment + my deposit to me after I've sent them the correct item.

There are two kinds of artificial constraints on Bitcoin: internal, and external. 
An artificial internal constraint would be like the block size limit, which all users are (or should be) at least vaguely aware of before they start using Bitcoin. When people start using Bitcoin, they are essentially "opting in" to these artificial constraints the same way people opt-in to the terms of service or community guidelines when they create an account online. Users are not coerced into agreeing to these artificial constraints, it's take-it-or-leave-it. Thus users have freedom of choice in this matter.  
An artificial external constraint would be like the Great Firewall of China, which affects all Bitcoin users whether you live in China or not, and furthermore is not even a voluntary constraint on people in China but instead forced on them by their government. These kinds of constraints do inhibit freedom, because people never had the freedom to choose to opt in to these constraints in the first place.  
The artificial constraint you're referring to, the block size limit, is an internal constraint that was freely accepted by everyone who has money on chain today. These users freely accepted the possibility that one day, demand for block space might be greater than supply and that the fee to move their money out of their address might be more expensive than the fee they paid to move the money into the address. Perhaps the market will move in their favor, and miners and the economic majority will come to an agreement about how to increase the available block space, and fees will go down. Perhaps not. This is the deal that they freely signed up for when they put their money on the blockchain.
Freedom doesn't mean "I get to do whatever I want", it means "I get to do whatever I want within the confines of voluntary agreements I have made with the people around me." Bitcoin is one of the purest expressions of such freedom, and should not be held responsible for the choices that people make about what to do with their money.
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:40:18
It's not necessarily the end users transacting on the network that need to know about Bitcoin's inner workings, but the users that are actually interacting directly with the Bitcoin protocol, such as developers building wallets and exchanges. Those developers should be advising their users that fees can fluctuate (like Uber surge pricing) and offer users the tools they need to have their transactions confirmed in a timely manner.  
The supply and demand market you speak of is not isolated to just supply and demand for block space. That market exists within a larger market for Bitcoin software, which itself exists within a larger market for cryptocurrency software, etc etc. Within the market for Bitcoin software, the market has, for now, chosen to continue running Bitcoin Core-compatible clients with the current block size limit. You can track how this market sentiment is changing on websites like  and

Since transaction fees do not make up a large portion of miner rewards right now, it's better that people buy and hold. This supports the price of bitcoin and also keeps transaction volume down (leaving block space for other uses). But in the future, when the coinbase reward disappears, we'll want lots of people making transactions that pay miners to keep securing the blockchain. That doesn't necessarily mean people need to be spending bitcoin - they could just be moving their bitcoins from one address they control to another - but the block rewards will have to come from tx fees, or else miners will drop out of the network and bitcoin will become less secure.

I like your YouTube comparison. That's how I see it. Supload is not an "affiliate" site.

Maybe Supload should just not make bitcoin payouts so prominent on their main site (can have separate landing pages for that and other marketing copy after signing up).

Satoshi didn't intend on everyone running a node, and understood that it would get more difficult over time.
"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate."

LN payments are onion routed, so a node that you send a payment through doesn't actually know whether the node they are forwarding a payment to is the final destination or just another hop in the transaction path.

 As long as a) the network itself remains open and b) governments everywhere don't over-regulate bitcoin mining, bitcoin will remain more decentralized in control than legacy payment networks. Yes, there is a power law dynamic at play as there is in many other kinds of systems i.e. a few with lots of power, and many with less, but because bitcoin is open and pretty much anyone with the resources can start mining, so long as there is money to be made, the hashing power distribution will remain relatively decentralized compared to the "solo mined" databases that legacy systems use.

That's akin to asking a random customer who their favorite candidate is for local office. Most probably wouldn't know or care. But some people are very passionate about it, and those people are the ones who determine who gets on the ballot and eventually wins.  
I think the same dynamic is going on here. People want to show support for their favorite client/ dev team, likely hoping to persuade other users and, more importantly, the exchanges, payment processors, and wallet devs who use customer feedback to make decisions about their technology roadmap (including what node software to run).

Yes and no. There are wallet apps like CoPay, Electrum, Mycelium etc that are clients you download and run on your own device. These wallet apps connect to a central server to show you the balances of your bitcoin addresses (and Electrum uses additional verification called "Simplified Payment Verification" aka SPV to ensure the server is not lying to you about your wallet balance). 
These wallet apps can be used with hardware wallets, so you create the transaction with your wallet app and then sign the transaction with the private key stored on the hardware wallet. So the wallet server cannot sign any transactions on your behalf, at worst it could stop you from sending transactions or lie about your balance (and SPV helps prevent the latter from happening). 
You can see a demo of this with one of the Ledger hardware wallets and the Mycelium mobile app here:

A full node does not have to upload traffic. Think of "[full node]( as shorthand for "fully verifying node", as opposed to a "full network node" which is a full node that also uploads traffic. But this is semantics - although the nodes I referred to don't upload network traffic, they absolutely benefit their owners by verifying that incoming transactions aren't double-spends. This eliminates the need for a trusted third party to provide double-spend assurance - the whole point of Bitcoin - and is what I think people are most concerned about when changes are proposed that would make it harder to run a full node.

There is no need for ether tokens if the bitcoin token can be used on a sidechain that duplicates Ethereum's functionality. Why buy and hold a token with a smaller network, less liquidity and more volatility when you can use a token that does the same things but has a larger network, more liquidity, and less volatility?
If you want to use the Ethereum network today, yes you need ether because a suitable alternative does not yet exist as a working sidechain for bitcoin, but this will not always be the case as we see with projects like Rootstock. What Ethereum has accomplished so far has been impressive, but from my perspective the value of the token is unsustainable.

Hope to provide some clarity here:
* Gateways can freeze IOUs that they have issued, regardless of what account is holding them, if they enabled the Freeze flag.  
* Gateways can indiscriminately freeze any funds held by accounts that they control the private keys for i.e. "hosted" accounts.  
* If a supermajority of validators agree to block transactions to/from an account, they can do this i.e. 51% attack.  
* If a supermajority of validators agree to increase the number of XRP in existence, they can do this i.e. hard fork.  
This is, in principle, not much different than Bitcoin; just replace "gateway" with "exchange" and "validator" with "miner." Where Bitcoin differs from Ripple is that control of the consensus process is more decentralized in the Bitcoin network. Right now, Ripple Labs could probably use their power/ influence over validators on their UNLs to freeze funds or issue new XRP at the protocol level, the question is whether the benefits would outweigh the cost of doing so. They could probably get away with the former, especially if a three letter agency tells them to; the latter however would not be very smart since they are wholly dependent on the success of XRP for the long-term profitability of their business.

Bitcoin isn't "trustless," in the sense that you are trusting the majority of miners to not collude against you. There are economic reasons that you believe that trust won't be violated, but it is still trust nonetheless. With Zerocash, depending on the trusted setup used, you have to trust that at least one person successfully destroyed the initialization secret without leaking a copy anywhere. The rest of the system after that trusted setup works on the same trust model as any other cryptocurrency i.e. mining.

It depends on how much you actually want to understand bitcoin. If you just want to be able to use it to buy things online, you can use Coinbase which requires no more prior knowledge than it takes to use PayPal. Even downloading a mobile wallet and buying bitcoin from someone on Localbitcoins doesn't take a lot of prior knowledge, you just have to know how to send and receive bitcoin using QR codes. If you want to *invest* in bitcoin and really put a lot of trust in the system to store value long term, it's good to understand *why* you should trust it, which is when you'll want to really dig into the technical details.

The fees per tx could be higher on the sidechain than on the main chain if the sidechain offers some greater benefit like increased privacy or some other desirable feature. The total fees collected per block could also be higher because there is more throughput on the sidechain.

I dislike having to type in CC info and I dislike that when I do, that information can be used to make unauthorized charges. Bitcoin provides a frictionless, more secure way to pay online, and if the user has a USD wallet such as what Coinbase offers in some states then Bitcoin can offer a more secure, possibly more private PayPal-like user experience (UX). If more services can get to the level of UX that Coinbase is at, then Bitcoin could, in the minds of "mainstream" users, be like a decentralized or federated PayPal (as in many centralized payment gateways connected by and transferring value using the Bitcoin protocol). This outcome isn't all that bad when you consider how many people use PayPal despite its issues - network effects are quite powerful!

Luckily, bitcoin already does have value, and was able to gain value initially because it was the first technology of its kind to offer some pretty cool features. Additionally, colored coins could be used to represent liabilities which have value outside of the bitcoin blockchain, using the network strictly as a transport protocol. Now, for that network to be secure so that transactions are undone, yes, bitcoin has to have value to incentivize the miners, leading to the seemingly [circular argument]( as to why bitcoin has value.  
Like any other commodity money, bitcoin's value is derived from a social consensus that its utility and properties are valuable e.g. scarce, fungible, divisible, portable, value-dense, etc. Is a limited-supply digital token that's released at a constant rate and attached to a global payment network which isn't controlled by a central third party valuable to you? And oh by the way, it also happens to give access to the most secure database in the world - if you don't care about the token itself, would that be valuable to you? If so, bitcoin is probably the best tool for the job, and increasingly more people are beginning to see it that way. 
Of course, it could turn out that relatively few people understand or accept this value prop, and bitcoin will either remain a niche product or fail and be supplanted. I'm bullish myself.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:31:32


Currencies fluctuate in value all the time. Bitcoin just happens to fluctuate more than others because a) it's relatively new and b) there's a limited supply with a fixed inflation rate.  


Bitcoin is not a Ponzi because a) there are no guaranteed returns and b) new money is not used to pay dividends to earlier investors. Bitcoin is simply a digital commodity with a price that fluctuates based on supply and demand.

this is a gross simplification due to eli5 but hopefully helpful.
with pow you have to buy computers that burn electricity to attempt to solve a complex math puzzle and create a new, valid block. the financial investment required to buy the computers and burn the electricity provides security to the blockchain by making it expensive to attack the blockchain. due to the rules of the bitcoin protocol it would be impossible to create valid blocks and overtake the "honest" blockchain without spending (and possibly losing) a lot of money.
with pos, instead of buying specialized hardware and burning electricity to create blocks, miners have to buy coins in the system. then the likelihood of a miner creating a block is roughly proportional to the number of coins they have. in its most basic form, pos is flawed because there is no cost for miners to create blocks that extend multiple forks of the blockchain (called the "nothing at stake" problem). there are also problems like "grinding" and "long-range" attacks that exploit the ease and low cost of creating alternate versions of the blockchain history, making 51% attacks easier and cheaper.

We started the [Bitseed]( project to address just this question: how easy can we make it to run a Bitcoin full node? Right now it's as easy as buying a node and plugging it in - if your router supports UPNP then there's no need to mess with your router settings, the node will "just work". 
Beyond that, we've developed an app that comes pre-installed on the node that gives you more control over the node like what kind of transactions you're willing to relay, how much upload bandwidth you're willing to share with the network, whether or not you want to connect over Tor or help Tor nodes connect to the rest of the network, and more.
Also important to mention: even if your node isn't "contributing to the network" by uploading blocks and relaying transactions, it can still be valuable to you by eliminating your reliance on third party Bitcoin servers, providing better security and privacy for your bitcoin transactions.
Check it out, and if you have any other specific questions please don't hesitate to ask here or over [email](

- User signs "votes" with their auth key, and since it it cryptographically linked to their bitcoin address via the blockchain ID, the user's signature is weighted by the bitcoins stored in that address.

@_date: 2015-11-16 18:27:11
I don't know what 21's plans are long term, but for this phase of the product's evolution the mining chip makes sense. As a dev, I can either get enough bitcoin to play around with programming transactions by:
- Signing up for Coinbase and giving over a bunch of personal info (friction)
- Meeting someone on Localbitcoins at Starbucks or wiring money to a stranger hoping I get bitcoin back (friction, possibly illegal)
- Earning bitcoin for work online (friction)  
... or I could just turn this little computer on, wait a couple of days to have enough BTC to do something meaningful, then start playing with bitcoin transactions, all without having to leave the comfort of my own home or give a bunch of personal info to strangers online.
I think 21 is trying to make it as easy as possible for devs to get started with bitcoin and that means removing as much friction from the process of acquiring BTC as possible. Once devs have have a small amount of BTC, they can start experimenting with building apps and sending and receiving micropayments.

Just don't. It's bad privacy hygiene, because it makes your transactions easier to track, and it's bad for security because you're more likely to leak information that could compromise your private key.  


An HD wallet will automatically create a new address for every transaction, extending from a "Master Keypair" that is generated using a "seed".  So if you save the seed then you will be able to recover all assets owned by all addresses derived from that seed's Master Keypair.


What do you mean "delete"? Why? You might be interested in the "cold storage spending" feature in Mycelium, which automatically wipes the private key after spending from an HD seed. But even then you should consider the seed "hot" and generate a new "cold" seed to store the change.  
If you want to generate your own seed (as opposed to having an app do it for you), I suggest using the diceware method or similar so that the seed is sufficiently random.  


You can import a seed into Mycelium that you generated yourself or with another HD wallet e.g. Electrum.

Hi everyone, I am working with the team that developed these units. We are happily surprised by the attention this is getting from the community, thanks to everyone for the great feedback. As you can probably tell by our incomplete website, we're not 100% ready for prime-time, but we're working overtime to get everything up-to-date.
To answer some of the common questions:
**1. Do you accept bitcoin?**
Yes! There are links on the product page to BitPay checkouts for both U.S. and International orders. We are currently working on a more seamless integration into the checkout system, it's just taking longer than expected.
**2. Who is this for?**
Right now, this is great for people who either develop bitcoin applications and want to have access to their own full node, or people who just want to support the network.
**3. Do you have instructions?**
While the unit is "plug and play," meaning that if you plug it into a power outlet and your router, it should work automatically, we are also including instructions with each unit that cover some edge cases that might cause people issues. Also included will be instructions for getting the device to work with the [Bitnodes Incentive Program]( (though we do not have the manpower to provide support for every edge case there, as that program does add some complexity).
**4. Can I build from source? How do I update?**
This box is just a generic Linux server with some custom scripts to automate the provisioning of bitcoind. You are welcome to uninstall what's on it and install whatever you want, at your own risk of course. As far as updating goes, the plan is to build a new bitcoind binary for major updates. Users will just replace the old bitcoind &amp; run the new binary. We're open to suggestions for how this can be improved.
**5. What about people who are scared of the command line? Anything for the muggles?**
I am one of those people, and while this unit is very straightforward to use on the command-line, we also understand that a nice GUI goes a long way. We're going to be doing a crowdfunding campaign for the next-gen version of the box that will have a more attractive case as well as a Web UI for local or remote administration. Follow us on Twitter [ or stay tuned here on for our crowdfunding announcement. 
If anyone has any other questions or feedback, feel free to DM me here.

"Gateway" is just another word for "bank" or "exchange," and comes with all the same strings attached (KYC/AML, financial surveillance, account freezing, fees, etc). You can already trade BTC for fiat on the blockchain today with ShapeShift's [TetherUSD]( exchange.

Neat idea but as others have pointed out, now you've shifted the burden from securing the private key to securing the BIP38 password. Have you seen Cryptosteel? That product more or less solves this problem by securing the seed to your wallet (with no trust required in the manufacturer).

Bitcoin is valuable for lots of different reasons. Some people are attracted to the currency, which is limited in supply and released on a controlled schedule. Others are attracted to the blockchain, and see it as a next-generation application platform. Still others just want to use bitcoin to make secure, private, online transactions (payments that are inconvenient, expensive, or impossible with credit cards). As the hashrate increases, confidence in the security of the system increases as well, which leads to additional confidence in bitcoin as an asset - a [virtuous cycle]( of growth.  
There's a lot of speculation as well driven by the above activities and sentiments. Over time, bitcoin will be valued largely for the same reason gold is valued so much: because lots of other people put a lot of faith in the future value of the asset.

That is an interesting idea. The board supports wifis we just don't have it configured to do so "out of the box" since that would add costs. Could also cause headaches on setup, not as easy as just plugging in an Ethernet cable. The full nodes are also designed to run "full time" so intermittent connectivity, while not necessarily a problem, would kind of defeat the purpose of the device. All that said, since it does support WiFi, if you want to buy one and add it yourself, be our guest! We'd love to hear about your experience trying that.

Some quick ideas:
- Dispute resolution is not always necessary, or even desirable. See the 2-of-2 escrow [BitMarkets]( protocol for a trustless alternative.  
- Perhaps more important than the smart contracts are the standards used by arbitrators to decide fault/guilt/innocence. Automated justice doesn't mean much if the means of determining the outcome of a case are inadequate. Is this what is referred to by "decision-making options for dispute resolution"?  
- Will bonds or insurance play any role in this system?  
- How will this global, borderless system interact with local laws and international treaties, if it does at all? (I see the reference to the New York Convention but am curious if there's more to this point)  
- If ADR already exists, what problem does this system seek to solve? Is it "just" an "open-source interface to traditional ADR methods, for even more options" or is there more to it than this?  
Great initiative, I hope The DAO approves this proposal!

ASICs are a good thing. GPUs can be resold for other purposes. ASICs brick when they're obsolete. This is good for security because it means that it would be harder/impossible for an attacker to recoup the sunk cost of the mining equipment if they successfully attack Bitcoin to the point of death (or, more likely, a hard fork to another PoW algo). The only way they'd come out ahead financially is if they made more money from the attack than the cost of all the ASICs + potential mining profits over the life of those ASICs.
BTW economies of scale will always lead to large farms over time [even with GPUs]( and GPUs do nothing to prevent seizure of mining equipment.

Key words in that second statement:  


This means that they will _already be running_ a SegWit release if/when Bitcoin Core devs add HF code to their client. So far some of them have not been doing that.  
You're probably right though: the language was imprecise enough that it let the miners weasel out of the agreement and lead us to the "stalemate" we're in today. So... UASF!

[Blockstack]( is currently exploring using merkle trees as a way to scale their decentralized DNS on the Bitcoin blockchain. All you'd have to do is pay a small fee to toss your name update transaction to a few "transaction packers" (in case one fails) and wait for them to build their own merkle trees of all the updates they've been sent and commit the merkle root of this tree to the blockchain. Blockstack will then sort through all the update transactions in the blockchain, use the root hash to pull the merkle tree out of the Blockstack DHT, ignore any duplicate transactions, and then change the state of the name records in its database according to all the valid updates. Pretty cool way to do this!
@_date: 2015-03-25 01:51:59

I think so too, just not now. The infrastructure is still too immature to support widespread use and micropayments on-chain. I think in the long run, lightning, sidechains, and other layer-2 tech that is very close to mainnet readiness will be able to support ~all payments-related use-cases.

That does not sound like a use-case where bitcoin is the best option right now. The change in your pocket is probably better: no mining fee, no price fluctuation, no tax event (other than sales tax).  
Use bitcoin where it makes the most sense - store of value, donating to controversial or international nonprofits, shopping more privately online - and use traditional payment methods for everything else.

$3 is still a very low fee compared to domestic or international wire fees, or the cost to ship gold from one place to another. Bitcoin's Lightning Network also allows for micro-payment sized transactions that can be sent with sub-penny fees and confirmed at line-rate.

No one is suggesting that BIP148 could succeed without either the support of the economic majority or the hashpower majority.

If you don't make any transactions before there's a clear winner, you'll be fine.

The craziest part is that nothing about their plan forces anyone to hard fork later, not even the people who signed the agreement. Even if the code they run to activate SegWit has a HF built into it, they can just uninstall that software and run something else after SegWit is activated.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:42:54
If the majority chain is a HF then old nodes won't recognize it. If I understand what you mean correctly, then if the chain split results in SF and HF chains, and no legacy chain, then to old nodes the SF chain will be the only valid chain.
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:53:00
There is no need to reimplement SegWit and activate it using a different signaling method. This has just added further _unnecessary_ delay. Technically speaking, whether they activate SegWit via Segwit2x or via BIP141/148 makes no difference as to the outcome of a 2MB HF.

Users run full nodes. Full nodes determine the valid consensus rules. If a miner mines a block that does not comply with the rules set by a user's full node, then that user's node will reject the block. It's that simple.

One challenge I have found is that for multisig accounts, you need to create a new seed for every multisig account you create. If you don't want to link your bitcoin deposits together, this means that you very quickly end up with a lot of seeds to keep track of. This is acceptable to some people, but not others.

If you use your node the verify your own transactions, then it does make a difference, albeit yes likely a smaller difference than if Coinbase's node enforced BIP 148.

The way the blockchain works, the more blocks are built on top of a block that includes a given transaction, the harder it will be for someone to reverse that transaction. And the more independently-controlled, geographically-disparate miners there are hashing away to build blocks, the more expensive it would be for an attacker to undo a given block. Full nodes are also important, because they make sure that miners are following the rules, but they alone cannot prevent a 51% attack from happening (full nodes could change the rules to make a miner's ASIC hardware worthless, but this is the "nuclear option" that would require massive amounts of work to do correctly, so is considered the defense-of-last-resort).

He has never been found guilty of that, and the evidence was extremely flimsy. The messages weren't PGP signed, and they were stored on a server that was controlled by corrupt FBI agents for extended periods of time. Not saying it didn't happen, but that I haven't been shown evidence that convinces me "beyond a reasonable doubt."  I think rather than take opportunities like this to make cheap shots at Ross, that you should respect his right to remain innocent until proven guilty.

I published a blog post yesterday describing what that "something else" is:  
  
Users to need lobby the economic nodes they do business with, and a majority of miners need to enforce BIP148. The former is a means of achieving the latter (if the economic majority enforces BIP148, miners will be compelled to as well or else chance losing lots of money).
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:17:59
The post very clearly says "sell your non-148 coins" if people can't do that correctly then they shouldn't do it at all. If there end up being two coins I will update the post (and probably publish a new one too) with accurate instructions for how to do this safely.

I'm not worried because that's just a made up number. Due to the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin mining, no one knows for certain who owns the hashpower and where it is located (mining porn from China notwithstanding). That said, &gt;50% hashpower in one legal jurisdiction would be a concern - one that we can't do much about other than a) avoid exacerbating the problem through changes to the protocol that further privilege said miners in said jurisdiction and b) building competitive mining facilities outside of said jurisdiction.

Hi, organizer here. I don't anticipate trouble, but I was hoping to head-off any problems which may arise by creating an accountability mechanism. My original intention was to try and implement a self-regulation / reputation system which would develop over time, and while I did consider the fact that it could be seen as a barrier to entry, at the time I didn't think it was that huge of a deal. My mobile bitcoin wallet can create multiple addresses, so in the scenario I envisioned one could be used for ID and the others could be used for trading, thus severing the link between ID and financial data. However after consideration, I'm removing the ID requirement altogether and the default policy is now laissez-faire. Thanks for your feedback! If anyone has any suggestions for how we can manage risk at the meetup I am open to suggestions here or  on Twitter.

Neither BIP141 nor BIP148 precludes the possibility of a 2MB hard fork 6 months after SegWit activates, as stated in the Segwit2x agreement. Technically speaking, whether they activate via Segwit2x or via BIP141/148 makes no difference as to the outcome of a 2MB HF. All reimplementing SegWit and activating via a new mechanism does is introduce further _unnecessary_ delays.

They could do that even if they activate SegWit via Segwit2x. No one is forcing them to run hard fork code on their computers. They can just install a different piece of software later that does not support the HF if they change their minds. 
The important thing to recognize is that there is already a working, well-tested SegWit deployment in production. It's a waste of time and talent reimplementing that when we could just activate SegWit via BIP141/148 and everyone who signed the Segwit2x agreement can install the 2MB HF code later once it's been tested and shown to be safe to run.

The common denominator here is that both sides want SegWit. There is nothing stopping the Segwit2x crowd from developing and running 2MB hard fork code after SegWit is activated. So consider what you quoted within the context of the rest of the post, which is saying that both sides want SegWit, there is already code for activating SegWit, so let's activate that and free up the Segwit2x dev resources to focus on making the hard fork code as safe as possible.

Not sure what you're referring to here, again, both BIP148 and Segwit2x supporters want SegWit and there's already code in the wild to activate SegWit so lets do that then August 1 will be a nonevent.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:13:37
BIP148 is not a guaranteed chain split, if a large majority of the economy is on one chain, and miners on the other, it's pretty obvious what happens next (spoiler: miners are forced to switch or else lose money every hash they spend after the split). If the economy backs 148 before August 1, miners will switch to support it long before the split.  
The only wrinkle here is that Bitmain has stated in their recent blog post that they will act against their short-term economic self-interest when BIP148 activates, which really tells me that they're willing to do whatever it takes to avoid activating segwit. Hmmmm I wonder why that would be??
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:23:59


I would say this is actually not true. LN allows for new use-cases that simply aren't possible on-chain. So rather than restricting the miner's market for transaction fees, LN actually expands it.

The reason some are "cheaper" than others is because they do not have as large of a market. The prices are driven by supply/demand.

First, I want to state that I love what you're doing here. A couple suggestions which are either improvements on what has been implemented, or are future features that haven't been in-built yet (both software- and community-wise; if these have been mentioned before sorry for the redundancy)
* Escrow / Arbitration
* User Ratings
* Pretty mobile apps (or is the web app good enough?)
* Security. Physical security. Like bouncers / guards. Lots of money in a public place = massive target. One way to enforce this is to reserve closed-off space at a library or other public indoor venue (like a media room), and have a bouncer verify IDs at the door (not necessarily gov't IDs, maybe just verify registered Bitcoin addresses). When transactions are occurring in an open environment, it's not too hard for criminals to wander by and do hit-and-run style attacks to take money and other valuables (like all the smart phones that will be present). Not sure how heavily policed Union Square is, but this is a consideration for ANY public / open OTC space. 
* Regular meeting space. People can broadcast their intention to be there x day from xx:xx and whoever shows up will be the ones trading. Not limited to just one place, but there should be a "Main" meeting space for the local open OTC market for the sake of continuity and convenience.
* Regular meeting times. Daily? Weekly? 9-5 Mon-Fri? Doesn't have to be dogmatic, since everyone has a different schedule, but for the "main event" there should be set times to facilitate maximum liquidity. 
* Local market website. Even if its just a meetup page or a free wordpress site, something is better than nothing. A Community message board is always good for facilitating communication.
When the Monetas Open Transactions app is ready, it could help facilitate Escrow/ Arbitration and the need for a pretty mobile app. Bitcoin-OTC, Trustcloud, Connect.Me, and Trustribe all offer various types of rating services, some more intuitive and relevant to this space than others.
I'm in the SF / Bay area and would be happy to link up with interested parties to help make the above happen successfully in this area. A blog post on p2pconnects.us is now forthcoming, thanks for the inspiration therealjoshrossi!

I don't think we need a prediction market, the vast majority of market participants (or their "representatives") have already spoken. 
50+ exchanges and 80%+ hashpower recently agreed to support the activation of SegWit:  
  
Nearly every major wallet, exchange, and infrastructure provider is SegWit-ready or in the process of upgrading:  
  
BIP148 UASF simply codifies this support and provides an opportunity for all these people to signal to miners their support for SegWit and send a clear message that the economic majority will not let a minority of miners block beneficial upgrades to bitcoin.  
Due to the events to date, it has, unfortunately, become a "You're either with SegWit or against SegWit" situation. Those who are "with" SegWit now have an opportunity to get what they want. It's their choice to seize the opportunity, or not.  
I would not support BIP148 if SegWit did not have the support of the economic majority, and based on the words I've seen written I believe that SegWit does have that support. Now is the chance to see if those who have voiced support for SegWit will walk the talk. If all do, BIP148 activation will be a nonevent.

I guess it depends on how you define "the financial system." I see "the financial system" and fiat currencies being inextricably linked, and Bitcoin as this new, totally separate parallel system.

The entrepreneurs and investors who have been betting on Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are encouraged to attend, so they may know the regulatory environment they have entered. FinCEN's March 18th Guidance and the California C&amp;Ds have made it clear that government has the virtual currencies squarely on its radar. Will this brave new set of technologies boom, or bust? The answer largely hinges on how well the industry adapts to its regulators.
Virtual Currency entrepreneurs can best get acquainted with their new legal responsibilities by attending this one day crash course and workshop. They will understand more about their federal obligations under the Bank Secrecy and Patriot Acts. They will meet and chat with the experts. Throughout the day's interactive sessions, they will have a chance to ask their questions. They will also learn all about state money transmitter licenses and have a chance to get better acquainted with their state regulators.
Rarely has there been an opportunity for such concentrated compliance learning. For those companies and their regulators, who are already on a steep learning curve about each other's domains, the landscape will become much clearer by day's end.
The day will finish with a cocktail mixer from 5:15 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.
From 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., VC3 attendees who are interested may attend an informal industry discussion of lobbying and self-regulatory strategies, Chaired by Ms Constance Choi of Payward, Inc. and leader of the recently-launched self-regulatory effort, the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA) that has garnered broad support from a large number of important industry players."

What are the plans for increasing member participation?

I'll definitely keep this talking point in mind. I've been mentioning this idea more and more as I speak with people who already kind of see the big picture (institutional investors, fund managers, stock traders etc). I have no idea where the direction of this radio conversation will go yet, but if there's an opportunity I'll be sure to mention the benefits of a decentralized, instantly transferable, global method of payment.

I am not in Beijing, I'm in the SF Bay Area. How that makes me an authority to talk about Bitcoin to the people of China I do not know but hey, I'm at the top of Google when you search for "bitcoin consultant" so I guess that counts for something! If you're ever stateside, look me up :)

I can see events like [this]( happening more and more in the coming years. Sure, a big transport like this only happens every once in a while, but storage costs are annual. It says in that article that storage at the Bank of England for some of Germany's gold costs 355,000 Euros each year. I think Bitcoin could help bring these costs down.

Where would you find IP address information for a transaction? I've always wondered this.

This seems ideal, however the risk to the bank would be the exposure to Bitcoin's price volatility if theyre holding a stock for their cusomers to exchange in/out of. Coinbase gets away with this model, not sure how they cope with volatility but we know at least that its feasible.
The best option for the bank would be to have access to an active exchange that they can buy/sell from live to remove price volatility risks and make the most money on the exchange fees. This means either starting their own exchange or working with an existing one (one of which has already responded in this thread). Good comments, thanks for your response!

"won't be regulated" ... for now. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 04:12:50
is this not two ways of saying the same thing?
@_date: 2013-06-03 02:33:54
They could if they really wanted to. Private, bank-issued currencies were quite popular in the 19th century, perhaps we could see a return to this model except with cryptocurrencies.

Good point, but do we really want another entrenched industry whose productive capacity is divided into serving customers and lobbying for favorable legislation? I hope for the best, but am preparing for the worst.

lol I knew an answer like that would come out sooner or later, thanks for breaking the ice early on. Exchange seems to be the top request so far, let's see what else gets suggested.

Seans Outpost would be good, any on this page as well:

I never said anything about reform. I don't care about reform. Though it would be nice, its highly unrealistic. "Hey, can you stop being corrupt and forcing cartels upon the populace which makes all your rich buddies richer?" Yea. Okay. Good luck with that. 
I care about freedom from criminal interference in my life, which means a strong defense is the best offense. 256-bit encryption is a pretty damn strong defense, not much more I could ask for (maybe quantum cryptography.. some day).

Because they would have easy access to buying bitcoins live and add their exchange fee on the spot, rather than buying and holding and being exposed to price volatility. Eg if they buy 100BTC @ $120 then a customer wants to buy when the market price is at $117 then they'd have to add $3 just to break even, if the price swing is even more drastic than customers will simply look elsewhere for cheaper BTC prices. Having access to a live exchange by running the exchange themselves means no exchange fees and no exposure to price volatility (provided the exchange is active enough to perform live second-by-second trading). That's my reasoning anyway.
