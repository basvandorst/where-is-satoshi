The thing is, asking where the money is from is literally their business. It has to do with anti money laundering regulations - something that the author was clearly aware of. Banks use tons of money to abide by the law to avoid fines and unwanted media attention. I can't help but wonder why the writer didn't just tell it was from Bitcoin.
Finding a bank that is supportive towards bitcoin is one thing, but finding a bank that is supportive towards ANY money, no matter the source, is plainly stupid thinking. And the author went to the second one here.
Having said that, the bank should have handled the initial contact much better, by at least sending a letter and giving a call before any action.

Gold will stay gold but you could transfer its ownership without transferring the gold physically. Like US Dollars used to do.

Do you think that we would have been better off without the gold standard in first place? I didn't quite understand sorry.

Never. Unless NYSE also decides to list stocks with no underlying company.

When you buy bitcoins with dollars, you convert your USD into BTC and by definition lose all the dollars. 
If you ever want to get your dollars back, you will have to sell your bitcoins. This is why the market value matters.
Even if you were never to sell your bitcoins, their purchasing power would be defined by their market value.

It's very easy to lose money because of transaction costs and comissions.
