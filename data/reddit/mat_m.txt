OK. Then I suggest you redefine the question: 
- How can you create a truly per-capita ID?  
I think the basic requirement are as follows: 
1. Every human being able to open one  
2. Every human being able to open only one
3. Account/identifier can't be lost
So If person A tries to re-create account he will end up having the same ID, and have access to private/password. 
4. Secure
5. Anonymous
Any biometric identification can be easily ruled out from start(some might not have fingers/eyes/voice). May also change. 
Possible solution **DNA identification**. 
Clearly some technology is still lacking/expensive, but - **if** you could encode a person's DNA and then hash it - you have a very good solution to 3 first criteria, and this could act as a public key. 
How would you go about the 4th one? 
This could be a problem. You could even split the sequence and use part of it as basis for public, and part as basis for private, but - dna is easy to steal. One possible solution is to use multiple biometric measures as the private, hoping that not all are lost. 
Question remains - how would one prove that his "hash" represent a real human, and not a made-up hash? 
I  cant think of any decentralized way to do that...

Question is how can can you verify that each hash is essentially a real human being? 
If you had an agency that could "verify" that some has is a real person - this could be pretty much possible. 
(side discussion - parts of the world that are disconnected)

Even if it might not be possible *today* it should be possible theoretically. 
However - the other questions are the one that should bother. 
One more item I thought about today - you need to be able to prove the person is living. (and dna can survive long)
