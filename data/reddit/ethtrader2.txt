It’s backed by billions of dollars of mining infrastructure (facilities and mining rigs)  and billions of dollars of annual electricity consumption. That’s all real and tangible.

Bitcoin is backed by the confidence in POW which is derived by the miners. 
USD isn’t backed by anything but the confidence in the US Government. People have zero confidence in Venezuela and that’s why it’s currency is worthless.

You definitely want to own your own coin as the premium is an inefficiency and a major attribute is owning your private keys! But it is positive to see the interest from Millennials and investors using their retail accounts to buy bitcoin. Ultimately, it would be best if all these investors just owned the actual Bitcoins and did not pay premium - 1 step at a time

It is a comparison of Retail Exchanges vs. an Institutional Exchange. Considering the Insitutional Exchange (CME) has higher volume during Q1. Q2, and Q3 and that coincides with Bitcoin's rise makes it a data driven analysis - I would not call that an opinion. Also, if he was short wouldn't he be saying negative things to make the price go down?

The article is solid and seems unbias. I got through much of their research report from the below comments. Its definitely an interesting and informative report that indicates viability for Proof of Work especially considering many protocols are all migrating towards Proof of Stake. I am a firm believer in a secure and decentralized Proof of Work mechanism for Bitcoin so I appreciate the ability for miners to be able to thrive in a market under pressure. Bitcoin is the future digital gold in a world that has been and is quickly migrating toward a digital world. Greater than 50% of payments out of China are digital (wechat and alipay). Cash -&gt; Checks - Credit Cards -&gt; Venmo/Wechat -&gt; Bitcoin/Digital Currency... That is the payment evolution I see
