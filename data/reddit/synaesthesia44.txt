This would ease minds on the tech front but still looking for the motivation for the citizen masses who don't need world transactions. Why buy my groceries or my car with it?

What if I told you my parents were 35? For traction you want the most people using as possible? My question still stands.What is the motivation for the average Joe, or what Will be the motivation for widespread US adoption.Small  Business owners,ok I can see that but what about everyone else?

I have a question that prob has been answered but I'm new.  What will it take for my Mom and Dad to adopt using bitcoin? I'm serious ... How will the average Joe that does not transact with any foreign countries feel a need to leave there comfort zone of the existing system that is backed by the fdic?  What will it take?

For bitcoin or any other crypto to really be adopted and truly get traction, What will it take for "my Mom and Dad" to adopt using bitcoin? I'm serious ... How will the average Joe that does not transact with any foreign countries feel a need to leave their comfort zone of the existing financial system that is backed by the fdic? What will it take?
New tech will make it easier but I am looking for the why, the motivation for the Average citizen.?

My point is most tech companies are widely successful because they get a Ton of users 1st before profit(Facebook,Twitter,Google). What will bring the masses here for average citizens?
