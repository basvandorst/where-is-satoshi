Please consider not using web wallets. Not your keys - not your bitcoin. Also, Blockchan wallet does not allow to use new SegWit transactions, that would save you fees (and contribute to block capacity). 
Good luck for you all surviving there!

You can try Rootstok ([ a Bitcoin sidechain (or is it drivechain?) that supports Ethereum contracts. They are planning to launch second layer for Rootstock as well (as Lightning Network for Bitcoin) to introduce fast payments there too.
Although currently Rootstock is federated (until Bitcoin will have new relevant opcodes), it gives the most  trustless "smartoshi.palce" you could get at the time being, I believe.

First, you must have "external" IP address so that you have distinct IP address that can be used for others to connect to you (my ISP did not provide it until I explicitly asked for it). Secondly, you must login into your router and find NAT settings, and forward port 8333 to your computer that runs your node (if your external ISP-provided IP is [1.2.3.4]( your computer might have LAN address [192.168.1.100]( for example).

On  channel, someone recently answered that non-pruning full node is not officially supported for LND.
Though Lightning Network wallets that utilized Neutrino protocol does not need a local full node, they rely on btcd nodes on the network that provide Neutrino feature, implementing light Lightning Network wallets. LND does support Neutrino too together with full bitcoin node.
I believe Eclair wallet uses Electrum servers (is that right?). There are "tricks" work without full archived node.
@_date: 2019-08-08 07:19:56
Running your own full node means you verify your transactions yourself. And even if you are not accepting incomming connections, your node still has (8?) outgoing connections to these "public" nodes and relay transactions and blocks it has *verified* itself.
@_date: 2019-08-08 10:38:19
Non-listening nodes \*connects to\* the other listening nodes. They verify, store and relay valid blocks (and valid transactions) received from these listening nodes, relaying this data to the other nodes it's connected to, working as yet another relay.

Creating a wallet means generating keys. It can be done offline.
Also, part of using a wallet means digitally signing transactions to authorize spending your coins, that also can be done offline.
What offline wallet cannot do is to check the balance. Online wallet can import so-called master public key to *only watch* your wallet (check balances, etc). There, you can see that you received coins, select these coins (UTXO's) into unsigned transaction, give it to the offline wallet to sign it, and use same online wallet to broadcast that signed transaction.

He said public keys will save addition byte, and since addresses (Schnorr PK) takes space within that 1MB (within scriptPub) this will save "on the 1MB block",as you say.
Signatures on the other hand, are in Witness space, after that "legacy" 1MB block, so it means more witness data will fit there as only one signature will be needed.
Some time in the future we might get cross-input and maybe even cross-transaction (single signature for all Schnorr-based inputs within the block) signature aggregation..? That would save even more space...

If universe exist, and we don't know (yet) the answer how it came into existence, it *automatically* means that there exists some entity that created it?
Look's like a lazy explanation.
How about this: let's investigate and get down into the details how universe works (and this is what scientists do), and we might come to the answers, instead of blindly jumping into convenient explanations.
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:09:43
There it came from then?
I guess answer to that  is "it was here forever, it's eternal, yada yada yada...". So universe explanation looks like this:
"Universe was created by God who is eternal/always existed i.e. never created". That's making things more complex, i.e. explaining complex universe existence with even more complex super-being able to design (and initiate) the complex universe we live in. This is not satisfactory theory (increasing complexity).
If we use that "eternal" card, how about I steal it and simplify like this:
"Universe was here forever, it is eternal always existed i.e. never created".
I've removed God from the equation, as it only unnecessary complicates things, and does not really provide the answer.

Fees does not depend of numeric amount of bitcoins, only on how complex (big in bytes, what is it's type, etc) transaction is. You could send transaction with about 1dollar/euro cent of fee, if it's not in a hurry to be received.

Make sure your node is accessible from "outside". You have to forward 9735 port. Maybe no one can connect to your node to create channels to you? I did nothing special and got 10 incoming channels.

But it is. Bitcon network is a  P2P (peer-to-peer) network, where every peer is equal, and is kinda basically both server and client at the same time. 
If you run bitcoind daemon, or btcd daemon, or whatever other implementation, you are running fully-verifiable Bitcoin node, that checks (and collects) every transaction and block, and forwards valid ones to other nodes you have connection with.
  
Yes, in addition to peer services (providing blocks and transactions to others), it also has RPC interface designed to be accessed by yourself (don't allow others to connect to it!), to inspect blockchain and manage your wallet, if you have one  created on the same node.

That's why there is guideline to not reuse addresses.
When A1 address sends to B1, yes, A1PK public key has to be shown to proof ownership via signature. And A1PK could be broken via Shor's'n'stuff.
But that's kinda too late, because change is sent to a new A2 address (thanks to HD wallets), and you don't know it's A2PK, because, well, A2 is just a SHA256 (twice? or something like that) of A2PK.

You need payment channel that has ballance on the other side to receive LN payment. You can close channel to receive satoshis to the regular on-chain wallet.
