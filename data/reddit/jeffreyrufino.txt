I havent seen this one before.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:12:46
I'm guilty as well lol
@_date: 2019-07-11 03:37:30
I love Andreas can simplify it for us mere mortals
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:58:43
Is this even worth it? Wouldn't it make more sense if we could buy at the servo Bitcoin? I'm in Philippines at the moment, and the app through coins.ph you can buy at 7/11 Bitcoin. You can easily cash out in a number of retail places. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:41:04
I will do the same. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:33:52
my buy got triggered at $6200.. last night. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 13:44:04
That was educational. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:15:02
This guy has been the reason I became so passionate about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:15:42
Good job Jimmy. I been waiting for the full video because the Bitcoin cash camp was busy on twitter trying to manipulate the crowd. I think your rebuttals was amazing.
@_date: 2018-08-31 07:14:19
How much does it cost with BTC?
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:31:47
Keep holding
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:06:58
Good 
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:49:43
Omg, how?
@_date: 2019-03-31 04:31:30
Must be bull season again, saw it a lot if 2017... 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:50:54
Good to hear, thank you 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:35:27
Financial crises? Maybe that person needs to research who caused it. The banks.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:50:52
Vertcoin is exactly in the same place. Don't wait. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:19:12
To be honest most of the projects are tied to the success of bitcoin. what i love about vertcoin is the community aspects of it. the devs are transparent, and also the roadmap deadlines are being met. you can view it here, 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:22:12
You deserve it man. Congratulations
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:08:38
We need a better system than this.
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:55:51
How the hell are they doing to judge this case? 
I hope they have technical people with investigation skills to help
@_date: 2018-11-09 03:27:45
Advise for? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:53:37
Sold now, to make more BTC later ;)
@_date: 2018-11-28 12:05:32
It's more riskier not to have bitcoin at this stage.
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:43:17
I keep reminding BCH to stay focused on its own project. Yes it's money. Every coin is money. The social attack has failed to take the BTC ticker. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 12:47:07
Handcash app solves this, sleep design that I think btc Wallets can learn UX from.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:37:10
So where were you when BTC was nothing? He was the first one who invested in this space. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:13:36
hahaha! Ver is gangsta! 
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:50:43
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:14:04
That sounds logical.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:44:58
Congrats you have been on Reddit for 2 years, in crypto for probably less than 2 months. You're very credible. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:52:43
Well said mate.
@_date: 2018-12-31 05:04:05
Thats good to know
