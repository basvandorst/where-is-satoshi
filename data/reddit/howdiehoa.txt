ok i´ll go with this and relax :)

Like Hal on Malcom in the middle when he reveals in court that he hasn´t been at work on a friday in several years to get out out of something. Great idea!

quote from the website:
 “Verified” Accounts are eligible for increased withdrawal limits and enjoy an increased range of deposit and withdrawal options. We recommend that all users become verified to ensure the best Mt.Gox experience. Becoming verified is easy, and the application process can be completed in a number of minutes.
so basically you need to get verified for serious deposits/withdrawals, whatever that means in $

although i don´t see something like this happening via reddit, the proposition alone should make people aware that an organzied sellout of some big holders would definetly have a huge impact on the price with all the panic-minded first time invesotrs. the same goes for a rallye up i guess. some people could make a lot of money using this system.
bitcoin-anarchy! 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:52:12
well explain it to me then. i think although it might be a good thing on normal markets, with bitcoin one "fair/open-source" exchange might do the trick. i am not sure, just putting the idea out there.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:38:25
I just learned about Bitcoin tonight and this is the problem that I see: Those calculations might be right, but the also don´t imply that Bitcoin will be the currency/technology that is going to make all that happen. Maybe we learn from bitcoin that a system like this has a market but Bitcoin might not be the one to make the race. 
I mean I went through the list of things I can actually buy with Bitcoins and to be honest it´s not very attractive at this point. And I also clicked on some of them and I couldn´t find anything about them accepting Bitcoin on there. 
I would love to see some major changes in the monetary system in the right direction (taking away benefits from the banks with fees and all) and I am hoping that this takes off!
@_date: 2013-03-11 00:25:01
ok let´s say i dl the software from  and install it (i have actually done that today and it´s taking forever to synchronize) and then my harddrive dies, i have no way of ever getting my coins back?
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:18:49
well fuck... i wanted you guys to check bitcoin24 (or any platform other than mtgox for that matter) out and now you broke it :/ let´s hope this works out alright.

check out this guy´s video-answer. he comes up with some interesting points: 
@_date: 2013-03-12 14:07:33
somehting major is about to happen :D
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:08:49
can we at least pay with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:28:40
i agree. he is trying to make it understandable. by explaining all details he would take away the focus off the real message. the fee is ignorable and would likely be reduced as bitcoin rises. and instantly... well the other day i was getting drunk at a bar and paid with bitcoin. i scanned the qr-code off the bartender´s ipad and less than 5 seconds later it made a kaching sound. i was surprised myself. the thing is that smaller amounts can easily accepted without confirmations, because it´s unlikely someone get´s a false transaction in the blockchain from his mobile phone for 5€. so it´s very fast, pretty much instantly. 
so yeah, no problem that he chose those wordes for the article.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:53:29
I have been far away 2 weeks and will be gone for almost 2 more months. But I´m not mining, just storing my bitcoin there. And at the time I left this felt like the way to go. (encrypted and backed up!)
@_date: 2013-03-11 01:18:43
ok thank you i will do the same :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:20:42
I agree that 1/6th of the world population excluded from legal participation sucks. I´m still convinced about cryptocurrencies in general though (I even would be if the US joined this ban) and bitcoin in particular. So in the long term this was expected to happen sooner or later. And to the long term investor, Chinese or not, this shouldn´t make a difference - assuming that the money he put into bitcoin is money he doesn´t need in the next couple of years. So yeah, I would hide those paper wallets and watch bitcoin unfold.
@_date: 2013-03-11 00:03:58
What do you mean "lost"? Coins can get lost?
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:36:38
you´re talking about accepting a payment without any confirmations, right? then yes you might be right. in that case i am not sure if there´s a way around it. if not this might be reason to believe in a scenario where litecoins come in handy, because afaik they have a much shorter transaction time. in that case litecoin would be to make payments right away and bitcoin for bigger transaction with a bigger timeframe (rent, online purchases...)
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:18:28
BitcoinsBerlin has the website  which let´s you buy anything on the internet (for a 5% fee). very trustworthy business with an actual office in berlin, germany.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:49:58
It makes a great case for a high sustained value for a currency/technology that works similar to bitcoin, that must not necessarily though.
@_date: 2013-05-13 09:26:15
I have bitcoin QT installed but am far away from that computer for  quite a while. Am I fucked?
@_date: 2013-03-11 03:17:13
yeah i think i can live with them being the lucky ones. but in scenario of maximum success of bitcoin it would come to a point where a few people own waayyyyy more than any individuals nowadays (bill gates would be a poor man in comparison).
@_date: 2013-03-11 00:42:35
well shit. i think i might have done something stupid. i installed the wallet and made a transaction to it before it started synchronizing (or maybe while). i checked the account on blockchain and it´s there already. i hope it works out and i have access once the sychronization is done (after 11 hours at 90%)
@_date: 2013-03-11 03:21:27
let this guy speak: 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:38:49
heyy nice! haven´t seen you on here in a while.. :) 
@_date: 2013-03-15 02:42:34
when you order there you mean? or just by clicking the link. i did that. ahh
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:13:04
if you are so convinced why are you reacting so agressive? a lot of people might be scared of this happening and the better way to deal with it would be to educate why this is exaggerated.
@_date: 2013-03-15 02:28:47
wtf is this?
@_date: 2013-03-14 08:55:51
i just keep the password memorized or hidden somewhere where only i will fin it (e.g. in my mail account in a fake mail or something).
@_date: 2013-03-10 23:53:38
i watched it all and i have to say that one question stays in my mind...
the first users who generated the first coins - 6 million in the first year or whatever - they made a lot of money. so far so good. if bitcoins rise people make money and they were the lucky ones.
however - and now my question - does this mean there is someone holding on to 3mio coins or something in this dimension (maybe the guy who invented it, satoshi the phantom)?
if so, that would mean he owns like half the marketcap of the currency we believe might change the world! 
@_date: 2013-03-12 00:14:10
the thing is that every bitcoin is divideable into millions of pieces. so if there were only 1 millions coins left, it would still be more than enough to keep the system running without any disadvantages other than not exactly knowing how many coins there are floating through the interwebs. 
this guy explains it and the video is worth a watch: 
@_date: 2013-03-11 03:20:06
For context watch this one first if you´re curious: 
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:52:11
Ok I´m not minig at all, I am just storing my BTC on that computer with bitcoin qt. And yes the wallet is encrypted and also backed up. So once I get back to it (in 2 months...) I will update bitcoin qt and then I´m good?
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:07:28
can anyone confirm this?
@_date: 2013-03-18 13:57:08
 use this one and you´´l be even more addicted. you can even have it play a sound with every order bigger than 10 btc or whatever you like :D
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:05:14
same here! it hasn´t been a month yet, but about 2 weeks...
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:22:20
i am not sure but did someone give me my first coins? :)
if that´s the case, thank you very much. i have already opened an account, but how do i claim these? i did click the help link, but it was pretty confusing and explaining the tip-bot more than what i have to do to claim the donation. help?
@_date: 2013-03-13 17:48:37
i am sorry to say this but the trailer doesn´t really meet the expectations in bitcoin. why do you let the editor talk? and the sound guy?
i am very excited about bitcoin and the potential of it. listening to some people talk about it gives me reason to believe that bitcoin will change a lot and really attack the banking system. you guys were not the people i am talking about. 
anyway, i do realize that this was the teaser and your goal is to get those guys in front of the camera. i wish you all the best!
@_date: 2013-03-13 22:43:05
this is awesome. i instantly started thinking about this and imagined a scenario where i am stuck in some country (i travel a lot in exotic countries) and i am in the need of money, or i simply don´t want to have cash or anything on me. someone can send me money almost instantly without having to pay big fees for western union or whatever. and in the other case i am not walking around with everything to steal. all i need is my online wallt or something. sweet! this is a real life example where bitcoins not only useful, but superior!
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:36:17
pretty much normal on zerohedge
@_date: 2013-03-18 16:09:14
in the "sum"-columns it tells you the depth. for a more visual approach i use this one 
i basically have both open, because the second one also tells you the engine lag time which comes in handy when shit hits the fan.
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:04:55
sorry for being lazy but maybe having an answer is this thread won´t hurt.... is bitmessage ready to use? if not, when so?
@_date: 2013-03-07 19:17:46
Ok so my first thought was that people would have to start getting paid in BTC and it seems like some of you - at least to some degree - come to this conclusion.
That is far away, but not unthinkable. 
Whatever it is that needs to happen, it would have to be something big as in something that would definetly raise the attention of the government to an extend where the G8 (do you guys use that term in English) or whoever would sit down and come up with an agenda on how to legally deal with digital currencies in general. Sadly I they or their administrations will most likely not like the idea of losing control over a growing amount of worldwide moneyflow. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 00:47:54
this also means that whoever has my wallet.dat has all my coins right? this wallet doesn´t seem very safe to me. having the coins online with password protections and a transaction code that is send to my mail adress for every transaction (the way it works on bitcoin-24.com) seem safer. opinions?
@_date: 2013-03-12 22:25:28
at  there are no fees! only for deposit and withdrawal, but not for trading!
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:43:04
If you were Chinese and owned BTC as a long term investment, would you sell now? If you ever want to buy again it will be a lot harder and probably more expensive..
@_date: 2013-03-06 11:21:32
Sure the entire Amazon inventory is very attractive. (Although I am not buying there anymore after I learned about the conditions they have their people working in over here in GERMANY! We recently had an undercover documentary à la michael moore that showed how they get busloads of people to come here from Spain, Poland and so on to work under conditions that are close to slavery). 
Anyway... yes amazon would be attractive - and that is also making a point for what I was trying to say: the example in your link is a workaround to buy a gift card with bitcoins, but not buying at amazon directly with your coins. 
So what if all those rich fuckers saw the potential of a currency like bitcoins with the same advantages as BTC - only 1 richmofocoin is exactly 1USD. No more risk when accepting the currency. All the big guys (amazon, dell, walmart,...) backing the richmofocoin would sorf of force it on the people. that could be enough to make it work - only the one big difference here is that the idea of limited coins was abandoned and the only positive effects we have left are no taxes(?) and no fees to the banks. still better than paying in US-$.
