Hi I am the sysadmin for all4btc.com and e4btc.com. I apologist for the late reply I have just now been made aware of this thread.


No our OpenSSL version has been updated shortly after updates was available.




The sites where running a vulnerable version up until Tue 08-04-2014 ~21:00. I do not know when the offending OpenSSL version was installed as this was done by my predecessor. 




We are in the process of acquiring new SSL cert for our sites (with a new key of course). as of right there is a small risk that the cert and/or key has been leaked.
The implications of this is that IF someone was very quick and crafted a custom exploit for the version of apache/linux we are running and ran it against our site they could in fact be in possession of our cert and or key. This would enable said attacker to snoop on customer data (name, email, shipping address, bitpay invoice id) IF they have control over a customers internet connection.
This issue will be mitigated as soon as we receive our new certificate at which point we will revoke the old one.
Kind Regards
