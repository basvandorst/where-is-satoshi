PayCoin is definitely neither known nor used. If the study is real, participants probably thought about PayPal or Payback when they answered if they had heard of PayCoin.
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:25:41
I'm surprised he's taking Checks. Is that still a thing? I think I saw the last one at some point in the mid-nineties.
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:36:10
"PayCoin, even though an apparent scam executed by the Garza family, is well-known in Germany." PayCoin? Really? This sentence alone makes the whole "study" seem fishy.

Great find! Even though I knew about OB for a while, this actually convinced me to download it. :D

In my understanding, closing a payment channel is always possible.
Give this prerequisite, I can imagine the following future scenario: The lightning network is built into most standard wallets. No matter how much you hold, a certain percentage of your wallets holdings is dedicated to open payment channels on the Lightning network. Every wallet thus automatically becomes a hub. When the need for a on-chain transaction arises, the locked Bitcoins are unlocked. So there's no need for extra investments since every hot wallet automatically becomes a hub. And even though lots of Bitcoin are probably stored in cold storage, given the amount transferred every day, there should be enough Bitcoin in hot wallets as well.

While the Lightning Hackday is designed as an Unconference, there are also some pre-scheduled speakers like Christian Decker, Fabrice Drouin, Johan Halseth, Kenichi Kurimoto and Giacomo Zucco: 
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:02:11
Those are sessions that will be announced in the morning. Basically every participant has the chance to do a presentation, workshop, discussion, demo or a live penis drawing on  during the Barcamp.
The main stage will be recorded and hopefully streamed, the Barcamp sessions only if the speakers explicitly want it.
@_date: 2018-08-15 09:54:59
There's the hackathon on Friday, August 31st, but the proper LightningHackday is on September 1st. So if you want to see the speakers and participate in the Barcamp, Saturday is the important day.

How did you implement the payment option? By now, there's pretty safe alternatives if you don't want the risk of fluctuations but still participate in the BTC world. Double spending is usually not an issue, so it must have been something else.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:54:15
Same here. Paid twice (after the first bill expired), transaction hit the network. Was never confirmed with bitpay. Sent then an email, hope to get my money back.

Well, since only 5 mps voted against the minimum wage (and 535 mps in favor), it can't only be driven by youth vote. Fun fact: The 61 mps that abstained from a vote mostly did so because they think the minimum wage is going to be too low. They are mostly members of the successor of the East German socialist party SED.

Personally, I don't think it's worth the wait. The 2nd generation of ATM is already being developed, promising cheaper hardware (e.g. the localbitcoins ATM or the skyhook opensource ATM. Try to get your hands on one of those.

That's exactly what the app does.

It did indeed. They are using the Schildbach client (Bitcoin Wallet for Android) and keep the BTC locally.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:05:41
I'd recommend Bitcoin Wallet for Android by Andreas Schildbach, because of awesomeness. However, KnC Bitcoin Wallet is giving out free BTC today, so you might give their wallet a shot, too.

Could you explain what crypto you use? And more importantly, what are your specific use cases?
@_date: 2016-03-25 14:32:35
If I understand it correctly, you were charged 60 GBP for a wire transfer. There's services like [bitwala]( that let you do wire transfers with Bitcoin, with a little (usually around 0.5%) fee added. So you can alredy save big if you use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:11:30
It will, don't worry. For future reference: Some wallets let you choose the fee you're paying for each transaction, regarding the urgency.
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:46:03
Isn't it still cheaper than paypal/credit cards? Why do you care so much about what to call it?
Bitpay has always marketed Bitcoin as "money over IP", so I assume they don't really care about the precise terminology.

I picked one of the videos (Shark tank pt. 1, mainly to try out watchmybit) and the overall quality is pretty shitty. Shaky handheld camera and the sound isn't always audible. Wouldn't encourage paying for this. Watchmybit seems like a great site, though.
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:25:56
Why does it matter what you call it? Fact is, you can move value around the world in the matter of seconds at very little cost while maintaining a pretty high level of privacy. The only mistake the community made early on was the claim that it had no cost at all.

I was more hoping for a use case today, like I can buy x with crypto currency y which isn't possible with Bitcoin, or I use it to send tons of microtransactions (fractions of a cent) to pay for content, or stuff like this.
I really would like to know if there are any niches where altcoins are actually the better alternative today. So not in theory, but in practice.

It's in the [whitepaper](
"Merge mining is a technique that allows Bitcoin miners to mine simultaneously other
cryptocurrencies with near zero marginal cost. The same mining infrastructure and setup
they use to mine Bitcoins is reused to mine Rootstocks simultaneously. This means that, as
RSK pays **additional transaction fees**, the incentive for merged mining is high."
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:41:17
You probably never heard anyone promoting gold and silver as a currency, because the major proponents have been dead for a couple centuries, when both were widely used as a currency. ;) Not sure where your praise for paper money comes from, but lots of people are into Bitcoin because they don't approve of the "scaling" that can be done with paper money.

Is there a way to actually back up this statement with some numbers?

If we don't reach 75% or 95%, why should the miners "move forward"? For miners, leaving everything the way it is should be the best outcome, that's what their business model is based on. Or should be. Not some ifs and maybes.

That's only partially true: "P2P Exchange will be entirely modular. What that means is that each cryptocoin and each payment gateway will be a module." So it seems that you can use other payment options as long as the provider offers an API and allows BTC trades.

From a sellers point of view, this makes sense. If you need to physically move for the trade, you'll at least spend an hour, maybe more to move around. Imagine doing that for 5 transactions a day which are worth 3-4 BTC each. Sounds like a full time job on less than minimum wage.

Most buyers on localbitcoins are happy to pay the 3-5% fee most sellers charge. It doesn't get more anonymous than buying BTC for cash. If you're just looking for a couple hundred EUR every other month, learning how to use all the exchanges isn't worth the hassle for the casual user. Also, one of the major sources for German casual users is most likely bitcoin.de, and the prices there are often quite similar to the prices offered at localbitcoins.

I'd say bitpay is the most convenient for you right now. Even though they charge a fee, they'll convert every BTC transaction you receive into the currency you want and wire it directly to your account. And if you want to receive the BTC directly without converting it (maybe in the future if some artist wants to be paid in BTC, or if you need some BTC to pay for webspace or some webdesign etc.), you can easily switch back or just get x% of each payment in BTC. 
And the best thing: You can still accept BTC! :D
@_date: 2012-11-09 11:27:28
Well, the Satoshi client isn't the only available client. And you don't need a laptop to use Bitcoin, any smartphone will do the job. There's more reliable services that help you get your hands on some coin. You can use an address shortener or firstbits if long addresses scare you off.

Doesn't even the ECB argue that Bitcoin is NOT a ponzi? 
"Therefore, although the
current knowledge base does not make it easy to assess whether or not the Bitcoin system actually
works like a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, it can justifiably be stated that Bitcoin is a high-risk system
for its users from a financial perspective, and that it could collapse if people try to get out of the
system and are not able to do so because of its illiquidity."

You can either mine, trade or buy Bitcoin. The last option is probably the fastest, there's several possibilities for this depending on where you live.
General advice is given here  and here 
@_date: 2012-11-09 13:18:36
For your regular OS, there's Multibit, Electrum and Armory, all under some open source licence with different features.
When it comes to webwallets, easywallet.org, instawallet.org and blockchain.info are all pretty convenient and work on your phone as well. The people behind them have been active in the Bitcoin community for a while and are well-known.
If you're using Android, the best full-feature client is Bitcoin Wallet for Android. If you don't want to download the full blockchain, Bitcoinspinner might be more appealing to you.
With all these options (except blockchain.info), you don't need to open any account or leave any personal information.

I need to do the transfer to FIAT for business reasons, so please don't tell me to hodl. ;)
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:06:37
They might be supporting both currencies, but they might call SegWit2x Bitcoi:  So they are pretty much doing the same thing BitPay does regarding names, but not dropping support for either one (unlike BitPay does).

Yes, the Lightning Network is still relatively small and very beta. But simply providing a lot of liquidity to other channels doesn't automatically make a node "powerful" or "centralized". Other nodes have to connect and route through it as well. Good stats here:

I share your concern, but not your observations so far.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:57:20
A full node doesn't allow me to instantly convert to fiat at market rate. It's good for smaller payments, but not if I need to maintain a constant cashflow without having to worry about exchanges.

Alright, let me fix that: The average power price is pretty high compared to other countries because of all the ~~subsidies from renewable energy~~ taxes.

Possibly. Is there any industrial mining operation in Germany? I doubt it, but please correct me if I'm wrong. The average power price is pretty high compared to other countries because of all the subsidies from renewable energy, so I doubt large-scale mining operations make sense in Germany.
@_date: 2016-05-31 15:26:40

@_date: 2015-03-26 10:54:04
I just doubt that O'Reilly will publish a second book on the exact same topic in Germany any time soon. Maybe Andreas is going to take his book to a different publisher, but so far his publisher has been O'Reilly.
And there's definitely already more than one book on Bitcoin out on the German market. Never said there should be only one. 
Andreas a core protocol developer? Source?
Edit: Just read Andreas' clarification. That changes things, of course.

I just bought a gift card to test out the service. They are using bitpay as the payment provider, but they are not supporting instant (0-conf) transactions. Maybe bitpay wasn't properly integrated. After 6 confirmations, the site stills says btc_pending. This actually makes Bitcoin the slowest payment option cardfy offers. :(
Edit: Gift card received. Took about an hour.

O'Reilly Germany already published a book on Bitcoin by Joerg Platzer, so not sure if it's worth the effort to translate Andreas' book into German.

The owner of room77 has been pretty vocal about Bitcoin for roughly 2 years now, and sort of infested his whole neighbourhood. :D It's sold as "local currency with global reach". The local community is pretty strong as well and everybody has been spreading the word. Bitcoin and Berlin seem to be a good mix, [and the media likes it](

Wrong. Get a lawyer and don't talk to the police. You never know what you might say that'll be used against you. This is just as true in Germany as anywhere else.
You will not automatically see a judge only because police questions you. Police is investigating first, they'll then forward their findings to the prosecutor who'll decide whether to follow charges or drop them. A good lawyer can optimize the outcome of this procedure in your favor.
And also, he'll give you some peace of mind.
Lawyer up!

You're absolutely wrong. Pretty much everybody speaks English, lots of conversations are in English, and around half of the attendees are non-Germans. So it's definitely worth swinging by. Next meetup is June 6th.

Is the Bitcoin Foundation forum worth the 2.5 BTC for an annual membership?

I think registering and voting is one option. The other option is just sending an arbitrary amount of BTC to the address provided below the video without registering. It's unique for each video.

@_date: 2013-04-29 13:23:43
* Pick a regular day (once a month) and a regular meeting place (some bar/restaurant which is easy to reach for most locals and has good beer/food).
* Tell as many people as possible, post your meetup on reddit, twitter, facebook, bitcointalk, meetup etc. every time you meet.
* Try to set an agenda or topic for each meeting, e.g. a small presentation on a certain topic or invite somebody who's got something interesting to share. Tell everyone about it.
* Don't expect too many people to come for the first time. Don't give up if for the first year there's a regular attendance of 2-4 people for each meeting. If you're consistent, people will return eventually.
* Try to give discounts only at the meeting, e.g. BTC for market price. You could also talk to the owner of the place where you meet to accept BTC or give a discount on drinks or something along those lines.
* Don't give up!

Even though the article may or may not be correct, Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten (sic!) is NOT a source that should be used for legal advice or anything else.
