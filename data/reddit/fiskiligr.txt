But is he really? Sure, he doesn't have the fame and glory of Steve Jobs, but he has been thoroughly recognized and rewarded - more than most people will ever receive in their lives, whether they deserve it or not.

Federal Reserve System is taught in school, Bitcoins are not. However, that doesn't mean people retain any of that knowledge about the Federal Reserve...

Newbies might not even be aware of what it means to be an exchange - examples of exchanges should be provided.

Yeah, if you are working for a corporation and you need software for a specific business purpose, freedom is not the most important aspect. However, when you are using a desktop or consumer device - freedom is extremely important. Ironically, free software found greater adoption in the business world because being free meant it was easier to modify and start using - it turns out proprietary is bad for business too. 
That said, I agree that content creators and creative minds need to be supported. The way I think they should be supported may be controversial, but essentially I hope that someday people will realize sharing the way that open source software promotes is to the benefit of everyone, and that we will be more inclined to share everything - that we won't need to buy food, pay for rent, or take on loads of debt to go to school - that all of those things will be provided by other people willing to share their labor in exchange for the results of your labor. 
However, it remains to be seen how all sorts of issues are resolved in such a system (i.e. the autonomy of the individual is extremely important, and how would we manage to meet the needs of everyone and permit total freedom to everyone at the same time? - maybe by decentralizing everything and teaching everyone to grow their own food and building strong local communities, etc.)
Anyway - my point is that your message seems to be confused. It turns out both aspects of free (i.e. free as in beer and free as in freedom) are extremely important for consumers and home computers, but it also turns out they both revolutionized the private sector as well - most of the tools I use as a programmer are open source, and the proprietary software I have to use are all built with open source software (i.e. a company stuck a proprietary wrapper around the combination of open-source Apache projects and called it theirs, and my company was dumb enough to pay them for it.) 
That said, we haven't figured out a way to compensate people for creating open source software yet, and I think we as a society should be thinking about what that should look like. I will give you a hint: going back to writing proprietary software doesn't seem like a bright idea as a long term vision, even if it seems like the intuitive response in the short-term.

I think it's damaging to always think of the value of Bitcoin relative to US fiat.
