BTW, this was back in the days when btc was still at $8000, not sure about the exact break even times.

Generally speaking, no. If the price decreases that doesn't mean you mine more bitcoin per day/month/year. Only when there are fewer miners mining bitcoin then each miner mines more bitcoin per day/month/year. Yet if you buy bitcoin while it decreases you are certain to loose money, while a bitcoin miner currently stays profitable until a bitcoin price of about $2000.
Also, the miner gets the amount of bitcoin you paid for it back in about 2 months now, so after that you will have more bitcoin than you started with regardless of the bitcoin price.
You can use this site for calculating the break even time and so on: 
The newest Antminer S9 has a hashrate of 13 500 GH/s and a price of $1600 (including PSU).

It probably is profitable, however, the initial cost increases the break-even time tremendously compared to buying a miner yourself.
I was looking into a Genesis mining contract until I found out there was a huge hidden initial cost attached that doubled the break even time (over 400 days).
I have now ordered an Antminer from bitmain which has like &lt;1/4 of the break even time.
I can't imagine bitcoin.com having a much better contract. You can buy a miner and join their pool if you really want to.

This wouldn't actually matter. If it would matter for some miner, he would have so much mining power that it'd be more profitable for him to mine without a pool.
Maybe this wasn't your point, just saying.

Not sure about the private key.
Transaction time depends on the amount of fee you include, with a high fee it usually takes about 30 min, with an average fee it can take up to a day or so, and if your fee is very low it can take weeks or months.

I agree, it would definitely be cool, yet I would rather be assured of a small extra payout in general.

So, buying a miner would only be better if it regained the amount of bitcoin you initially spent on it. Today, an antiminer S9 is about 0.16 bitcoin on bitmain. However it'll generate an average of 0.85 bitcoin per year. Even when the difficulty increases I think this miner has mined it's own bitcoin back in at most 6 months! Including electricity cost. Even if you'd buy it for more than 0.16 bitcoin.
So then this would be a better investment than just buying right? What am I mistaken?

I moved to bitfinex after trying to create an order for over 20 minutes. It's such a shame, Kraken is great on almost every aspect, but the slowness is just unbearable.

Thank you for explaining!
So for point 3, the transactions with the highest fees are stacked until roughly 1mb and then the first miner/pool to find a hash for that group gets the block reward.
Nice, thanks again.

There are numerous exchanges on which you can buy bitcoin with fees around 0.30%. Bitfinex is one of the largest. They mention a few on the newcomers post: 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:24:39
Read the newcomers manual please.
In short, gdax is an exchange on which you can buy and sell with 0% maker fee. To do this you simply create an account on their website or, since gdax belongs to coinbase, create a coinbase account.
Trading is done via your wallet, but you'll understand that from the manual.

I agree.
I might buy an S9 anytime soon, but it depends on the results of the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:16:54
I'd explain why it's different than a traditional bank and that everyone can see it online (show them some blockchain.info transactions). Also talk about other popular coins and what's the difference between them and bitcoin.
For the blockchain part I'd only explain that it's basically a list with everybody's name and the amount of bitcoin they have. You can also say the miners control that list via a mathematical almost unhackable formula.
Finally you should tell them about the risks, that bitcoin is in fact nothing and that it might crash anytime. Everyone could start their coin, the only value is trust.

You expect &gt;35% decrease again?
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:45:48
Not necessarily, yes life will be less stressful, but those 120 days means you get the amount of btc back that you paid for it, then your bitcoin wallet will just rise slowly giving you probably more profit.
Probably in about 2 years you'll have about 1 full bitcoin which is then probably more than $2000 in bitcoin today.

No, mining difficulty decreases when the total hashing power decreases to make sure blocks will always be mined within reasonable time.

That's what I thought.
