Gemini is awesome! I've had nothing but good experiences with them! I used Coinbase for a long time and thought long withdrawals was the norm. I've since switched to Gemini and it's spoiled me.

Hopefully exchanges won't suspend very long. Any clue of how long exchanges suspended trading of Ethereum during the ETH/ETC split?

Should I worry about replay protection?

I was under the assumption the price would shoot up after a small drop on August 1st, but with this much money in shorts it has me rethinking it.

I sure hope so. To da moon we go!

I sent out a small amount last night and it took approximately 2 hours.

What does the amount have to be above in order to get a 72 hour hold? Why not just do several small transactions?

Coinbase's app works as well. You can set alerts for Bitcoin and Ethereum when the price rises and falls. Very easy to use, just limited in which coins you can track.

It always takes me 6-7 days. I'll see it processed in my bank a few days before Coinbase transfers the funds.

Ok, makes sense. What your favorite Segwit wallet?

Oh wow! I wonder if others are having the same problem? I just tried to withdraw a small amount to see how long it will take me.

This is good to know. Could be the case with a lot of people.
