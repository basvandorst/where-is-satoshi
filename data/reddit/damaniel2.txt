Bitcoin will survive pretty much anything bar the nuclear annihilation of humanity, but will anybody ever trust it as long as the people running the infrastructure keep on getting outed as crooks and scammers?
Argue about the worthlessness of the US dollar all you want, but at least the vast majority of people trust the entity that issues it (and most of the entities that handle it).  All I see in the Bitcoin world is a bunch of scams and frauds that (rightly) scare away the critical mass of people who would use Bitcoin as an actual currency and make it a success, instead of the purely speculative vehicle that most Bitcoin 'users' treat it as.

So that's two criminals removed from the Bitcoin Foundation in just the course of a couple months.
Is there anyone on the board there who isn't a criminal, facilitating criminal activity, or who isn't ready to cut and run with your money and/or Bitcoin at the soonest opportunity?
The greater financial community will have a hard time taking cryptocurrency seriously if everyone involved in it keeps on acting like a bunch of criminals.

Exactly - and even Bitcoin still creates a paper trail, since (for most people) cash still has to be converted to BTC at some point.  As long as paper trails exist, nothing will truly be anonymous.  Even the Silk Road got shut down due to paper trails in the clearnet, and in that case it only took a couple of offhanded posts in a web forum somewhere to take an entire 'anonymous' site down.

Because they want real money in exchange for their goods, not virtual money.

Not so much sloppy as "I don't care".  He specifically knew what was being done with the Bitcoin purchased from his company, and let it happen anyway.

Not to shout I told you so, but would you expect any less for a currency that prides itself on anonymity and decentralization?  The model lends itself easily to all forms of scammers and thieves who see stealing Bitcoin as an easy way to make money.  
The only reason that this guy may ever see a prison cell is because dollars are missing too.  If it were just Bitcoin involved, then no court would probably bother to prosecute.

And this is why it's hard to take libertarians seriously.  Only the criminally insane would argue that drunk driving isn't criminal activity.  Yes, you can split hairs and argue all day long that the actions made while drunk driving are the crimes, and not the drunk driving itself, but these dangerous actions are all **greatly** increased by drunk driving -- so much so, that it's justifiable to make the activity itself a 'crime'.  
I know I wouldn't want to live in a world where drunk driving is legal, and where the legal system is only used to clean up after drunks exercising their 'freedom'.

In libertarian land, perhaps, but in the real world, there are victimless crimes everywhere.  
And yeah, most drug laws are (theoretically) victimless, but as long as we have restrictive drug laws, prices stay high, and people have to turn to illicit sources of money to fund their purchases.  Even if most transactions made on the Silk Road were from earned money, some weren't, and were the result of thefts or other crimes.  Hardly victimless.  (In the end, the sooner we can end the drug war, the better off we'll be.)

Nice, and easy to set up!  Amazon GCs are as good as cash to me, since that's where I spend most of my money anyway.
