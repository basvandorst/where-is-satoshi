As someone who knows Bitcoin so well, could you speak to what the biggest downsides to Bitcoin are? If you could reboot Bitcoin but keep it's popularity, what would you change?
Obviously you're a huge fan (me too!) but I figured someone who knows it so well would also have some keen criticisms, as nothing is perfect.

Has to pass the senate and be signed by governor. But house was possibly the largest hurdle.

The plurality (majority?) of the state pop lives in Merrimack Valley, with Manchester at the center. So Manchester is probably the best place to start.
Feel free to DM/email me (kauffj with questions, always great to have more Bitcoiners around.
There is also a weekly Bitcoin meetup on Sundays in Manchester that is the longest running in the world.

I think so, but someone else invited me and I am new to this whole process. So please don't come on my word alone :)

Great point, I changed the phrasing. 
As is, the bill is written that the state can't accept costs, but as you say it doesn't really cover implementation and that is one of the Treasurer's contentions.
