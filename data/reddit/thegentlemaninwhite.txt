More like $2000 if you count $100 in value for a bill + $100 in bitcoin on each. Of course, there's no knowing whether the BTC will appreciate to the point it will be worthwhile somehow. More like an art piece than an investment at this point.

That's the problem! We need to be drinking more.

Of course, the easy way around this is to simply give everyone IDs using random numbers and characters. Correct?

Regulating crypto is like trying to regulate the tide. You can make rules, but good luck with enforcement

It's worse than Mt gox. It should be common sense not to leave your money in an unregulated exchange. A bank, on the other hand, is *supposed* to be a trustworthy place where you're able to store money without worry. (not that this is really true)

I understand that a decent computer system will delete your old account after you start a new one OR it will realize you're the same person and give you back the same id number. 
I also understand that you would need hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people calling in a new account per day to max out the number of ids a normal bank could handle.

If they had an ounce of sense, they would do a 180, embrace crypto, and start competing with sites like coinbase before PayPal gets wiped the fuck out. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 19:19:12
Well shit, they are a bit overstaffed.

I want to be paid in BTC without having to wait forever for coinbase to transfer to fiat. I don't care about the investment side of BTC right now, just the speed 
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:05:41
Yeah... but that actually happens regularly.

117 million customers... yeah I don't think paypal is allowed to count people they banned three years ago.
@_date: 2014-01-12 19:02:56
How many employees does PayPal have?

Also, overstock has to pay fees on all the credit card sales. Bitcoin is free for all parties.

For one, let's watch Washington try and tax all of our BTC transactions... like using a tipbot. I'm sure they can prove it was you who used it, how much you sent, and the value of the coins. Especially since there isn't a standard method of determining the price of BTC! When they try to tax my BTC, I'm going to say it's value was $0.0001 per coin at the time. The gov't doesn't have a way of saying otherwise without declaring an official exchange with which to determine the exchange rate. Good luck with that.

If Satoshi is real, there's no way his last name is actually Nakamoto. Using your real name as a fake name is a really shitty fake name.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:09:37
This will be even worse if he isn't the real Satoshi, and he has nothing more to his name than the average old guy.

As much as it would help BTC if PayPal took it, I would much rather see them go. They're a shit company running  on a good idea.

I'm not sure I can help you then. You should create a post on this sub asking for help. I'm sure someone will know something.

This reminds me of my missing online wallet. In 2010 I got a free online wallet that just gave me like 50 btc for signing up as some promo deal. The URL was my password, and I have since lost the URL. It's possible that URL is somewhere deep within my chrome install or on my old laptop, but I was never able to find it.

Yep, I remember that. It would appear we've returned to the same place.

Please don't say "the" wallet file. It's A wallet file. There could be a million copies of it for all we know. It's not like a car where there can (or at least should) be only one of each individual car with it's own VIN number, etc.

As a web developer, I can tell you that it's not that hard to remove certain sections of a database one might not want seen. Especially after transactions have long since passed and no one cares about them anymore. Not saying he did this, just saying it's possible.
