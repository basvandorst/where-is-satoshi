Could you name a few, and their solution?

Thank you!
Once randomness bar is full there is no point in moving the mouse. Once bar is full there is enough entropy to generate all addresses.
There are some libraries that are common to both bitaddress.org an offlineaddress.com but nothing more.

that number is used only to mouse coordinate space (useful for lazy users), it's not necessary for entropy needed to generate private keys. All needed entropy is provided from user's mouse movements.
Other problem is local source itself: some users have older browser, and some users have infected machines which might have compromised browser.

Oh, I didn't see that. Thank you, I'll fix it right away.
EDIT: fixed :)

The "perfectly secure offline wallets" has to be created with entropy equal to 256 bit for each address that's created. Since entropy of pseudorandom source is equal to the size of seed from which it's created, all 256bits/address have to be provided from different source that provides each new bit of randomness unrelated to the one before. And this is the first site that creates those bits from human-provided source, so the entropy of each new bit has upper limit of 1.0. Think of it this way: if sum of all bits for all addresses that you're going to create can be described (let's say zipped) in space that's smaller then 256 bits/address, then the addresses aren't "perfectly secure", however if random sequence can't be described (with any equations like LDG) then it's fine.

Yes, that would be cool! I'll probably add that at some point. :)

The site works offline (just load it once and the browser will keep it locally, even after you restart the browser), but I still didn't implement download option.
I'll probably add more templates soon - I have one nice template I'm working on right now. :)

That's always the risk with any software. That's why open-source is much better then closed source. So if someone finds problem in open-source he can share it, and warn others.

The table from:
shows there is no standard C/C++ seed with more then 32 bits of entropy - so unless some additional entropy is inputted from somewhere, the code will behave in one of possible 2^32 ways, leading to the same number of possible keys (and addresses) that can be generated.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:06:13
So you didn't even look at the site. :)
If you go to  you'll see that all randomness IS provided from mouse movements (like you suggested).

From each cursor position I get two bytes of entropy. I'm thinking of ways to dynamically change amount of entropy collected based on length of users movements. However I'm also xoring all those cursors position over pseudorandom sequence to make mouse position uniformly distributed over all possible locations.
Entropy from /getinitrandomness is extremely high - that's java.security.SecureRandom ( which is complient with FIPS 140-2. It traverses the list of registered security providers on the system, and picks up the most preferred provider, which is then system-seeded.

Hi cantonbecker,
Thank you for your kind words.
As for:
1) Mouse movements are superior to predorandom generators like window.crypto.getRandomValues() (available only in newer browsers) because each next value isn't related to previous value - which makes them harder to guess. Check out: 
2) jquery-UI build isn't customized in JS at all - it's byte-equal to version you get when you download unmodified jquery-UI build (the file you get is called jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom.min.js even if it wasn't customized at all, like in my case).
I'm also looking into ways to automate checksums testing - is there some nice way that can be done in the browser, each time user loads the site?
@_date: 2014-01-12 19:44:21
It's not there yet, buy I'll add BIP38 probably very soon.
