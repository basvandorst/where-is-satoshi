What is the general public's opinion on bitcoin in korea?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:17:39
Yes, but ultimately I think it will be good and healthy for btc. More liquidity in the market. There will be shorts, but also long positions. And honestly I think btc could use some short positions rn, the price seems to me to be pretty exuberant.
The risk is that there is a concerted effort by large institutions who don't want bitcoin to ultimately eclipse the $ and they may try to destroy the market. But who knows, we'll see. In the short run over the next year LN will help btc realize it's true potential. At least for small purchases.

It appears many of the institutions aren't allowing your run of the mill investor to short bitcoin. So none of us could if they wanted to  (probably). 
I'm sure the well connected people rich in garbage $$$ will be able to short it though....

I wouldn't be surprised if it went below 10k. But I think it will continue rising until futures trading goes live, at which point it will dip a little, and then skyrocket. A month or so after futures trading is around, then I expect it may collapse to that below 10k range. I fully expect some of the financial institutions to start trying to sell huge volumes to incite panic and kill btc. Of course they'll fail. HODL

Lightning network will change that.

One time my brother and I were touring Boston with our cousin.  We rode the ferry in, and when it was time to leave we decided to uber back to my uncle's house instead of taking the long ass train. For some reason we told my uncle, who lost it. Said uber was dangerous, more expensive, the drivers could murder our cousin etc. etc. 
It's crazy how old people can get triggered by new technology when they hear just one bad story about it.

Look. Quit trying to time the market. Put in $20 every week. HODL. That's all.
