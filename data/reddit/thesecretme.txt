That's probably because those topics aren't of much interest outside the tinfoil hat crowd.
@_date: 2016-08-22 05:23:23
Only as a demonstration of the hypocrisy and ignorance of bitcoin fanatics. 
Oh bitcoin is so great as an unregulated means of transaction. Oh now we're getting fucked over because we don't understand the implications of what we're doing, why won't someone do something! 
@_date: 2016-08-22 21:30:21
meh, this sub is always good for a laugh.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:53:05
Alright mate, tell yourself some more stories. Seems to be making you happy.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:09:55
That just shows ignorance altogether. You play the things you can reasonably plot, predict and calculate. Beyond that you’re no longer talking about finance but gambling.
You mention finance and math, those don’t apply to bitcoin. That’s the realm of blind faith and dumb luck.
@_date: 2016-08-27 06:02:11
People disobey authority all the time. Coiners tend to make it sound like some kind of act of resistance against a nefarious authoritarian power with bitcoin as their weapon and justice as their goal.
It makes them sound like a bunch of clowns acting out a fantasy.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:37:56
Oh sweety. Are you sure you should be handling your own money?
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:21:59
That sentence is such a weird contradiction. Bitcoin is nothing like digital gold. So if you claim to understand the concept of bitcoin as digital gold, you clearly don’t.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:05:52
That is some bizarre reasoning. You think your bread is valuable because the grain farmer owns a lot of tractors?
Gold doesn’t have value because someone put effort into mining it. That just increases cost.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:56:19
It's not that he's not good with tech, tech is not good with reliable investments. For every Microsoft or Facebook, there are countless tech companies that balloon and die instead of making it really big.
And long-term success in investing relies more on caution than anything else.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:36:44
Not quite. Because the price was too volatile and warranted a level of attention he wasn't willing to give it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:12:34
If dips on something as volatile and unfounded as bitcoin scare you, you probably invested too much.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:58:11
Wallstreet gets paid whether their trades pan out or not. They're trading other people's money while taking a fee.
They'll laud individual traders who make big gains while forgetting them tomorrow when they fail. The big gains make good advertising but it's the fees that come in win or lose.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:38:14
You can't ignore it if you want bitcoin to have a function. It can't function if it's so volatile that it requires permanent supervision to be useful to you.
Since he's not willing to monitor it as needed, getting rid of it was the right decision for him.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:44:40
You're missing the point. Unchecked growth isn't necessarily a positive for a value storage either.
The whole point of finding a way to store value is to keep it as stable and predictable as possible. Ideally having its value tied to or backed by very stable and predictable factors.
The reason people love gold as a store of value, for instance, is that it's a known quality that is very likely to not change in radical ways. Ie.
* gold does not rot
* gold does not corrode
* gold cannot be produced in any meaningful quantities and certainly not cost effective
* the laws of physics place a limit on the amount of gold available, found and unfound
At the same time, the value of gold has an inverse relationship to the economy. If the economy is doing great, the gold price sinks slightly. If the economy is doing poorly, the price of gold goes up a bit. Very predictable changes.
I'm not making an argument for gold over bitcoin but that is what makes a good store of value. Predictability and stability. Bitcoin has neither.
At the end of the day, bitcoin is not a store of value. It's not a functional currency. It's not an investment. It's not a money transfer system with low fees anymore. It's a gamble that can pay off.
And the only problem I have with that is that I never got into bitcoin because I wanted a profitable gamble. I wanted a currency or a money transfer system and it stopped being that.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:52:26
It's not a store of value because it's in no way connected to anything of value or any economic principles that make it a good hedge.
The whole point of a value store is that it'll predictably hold it's value in the face of unexpected events. That's the opposite of bitcoin. Bitcoin shits the bed or spikes it's value every time someone sneezes.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:39:36
You're only saying that because you have far more faith in bitcoin than you should. You don't play a market that's so volatile and so messy in terms of technology, politics and legislation.
You get a little bit to experiment and hedge your bets. And a little bit for them might be a lot in your terms. But they're not some sinister manipulator of the market.
The bitcoin market isn't interesting or predictable enough for that.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:15:12
Yeah didn’t care for that argument either.
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:15:59
Gamblers. Not speculative investors. Gamblers. Big difference.
Speculative investors have something more rational to say than 'bitcoin goes up, bitcoin goes down'.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:40:08
Its hard to be harsh to your kind of stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:51:56
What a wonderfully empty statement.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:36:19
But never the businessman. 'Best' is rarely relevant to success.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:14:35
If that's their goal they're sabotaging themselves. If you want bitcoin to be a currency you don't achieve that by not spending it.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:18:18
How do you even expect to hold this conversation if you’re so confused and clueless about the words you’re using and comparisons you’re trying to make?
You’re just comparing random financial concepts now trying to figure out a way to make yourself sound good.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:48:18
Fair enough. Then again, by now the US has fucked so many countries and peoples over that it's probably safer to keep that military.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:01:37
I'm not asking them to leave. I'm just asking them to stop benefiting from everything they refuse to contribute to.
Having to basically leave society is just a side effect. But look on the bright side, they obviously didn't appreciate or want it if they think they're being robbed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:15:51
Oh it will. I just think it'll stabilise on a value that a lot of people are not going to be happy with. It's current value and volatility has nothing to do with utility, it's eventual value will.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:16:47
You're missing the choice where you can pay with either the bitcoin you own that are increasing in value or the fiat you own that isn't.
It's a pretty binary choice really and you're choosing the less effective of the two available to you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:44
You might want to figure out what 'opposites' means first.
I'd love to see people get into crypto in a rational way exactly because I'm sick of those irrational idiots spreading their lunacy.
So no, I'm not going to be particularly rueful when their stupidity blows up in their face. I just feel bad for the people they drag down with them by perpetuating bitcoin fairytales instead of rational approaches.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:47:57
To be fair, the current fees and volatility don't exactly encourage spending. At the same time, the volatility and value rise based on nothing even remotely related to utility does nothing to inspire confidence.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:36:58
Alright, try and make a good argument for that. I'd love to see it.
So far the irrational bullshit here has been through the roof. Even for @_date: 2017-12-07 20:37:22
How do you reconcile me saying tonight is the reason I sold with me being upset that I sold?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:41:09
I understand the concept. That's just not the context in which the example was used though.
So utterly irrelevant but thanks for bringing it up I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:49:25
Funny. I hold bitcoin and I don't have any gold. But that's the type of response I usually get when you try to get rational with coiners.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:06:17
The funny thing here is that just like at the start of the year, there's probably nothing objective or actually relevant you can tell them.
You might as well be talking about your roulette habit. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:44
I'm not. That's just another assumption on your part.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:55:50
Gold has utility though. Bitcoin and gold really aren't that similar outside the simplified comparison people like to make to excuse hoarding.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:07:13
Life must be so complicated if you refuse to face reality and just come up with stories about everything.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:32:22
I understand that it might be a foreign concept to you but life is not about extremes. Just because I'm not a hodler parasite or a new paradigm cultist doesn't mean I'm your boogeyman.
I'm still holding bitcoin. I'm just a little more realistic about what that means. And a few other things apparently.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:01:22
What a sad society we built where people grow up so greedy they are blinded to what they have by missed opportunities and dreams.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:18:33
I get that. But it's worth pointing out that your story is just that. A story. 
Making financial decisions based on wishful thinking is a recipe for disaster. A good fortune simply through dumb luck.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:29:42
I don't think you're making a very good case for yourself if you have to refer to corner cases like that.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:45:36
It always amused me that the Western nation that pays the fewest taxes and treats their people the worst, always whines the hardest about their taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:17:01
Of course, you can if you want to. It's not a very efficient way to deal with your finances though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:31:35
Don't you just love a complete lack of oversight and regulation? It's working out great!
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:38:41
You're blaming income tax for the outcome of an ignorant voter base and a corrupt set of politicians.
Ever noticed how the nations with the highest quality of life invariably have the highest taxation?
You're blaming the tool for the intentions of the wielder. America is digging its own grave by constantly voting with their hate and stupidity instead of their ambitions for a better society.
It deterioated to the point where they've taught you to hate the solution and vote for the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:12:49
Sounds like you didn't inform him very well if 'hodl-til-he's-18 kind of gift' sounds like a rational decision to him.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:38:33
I have bitcoin and I still agree. I absolutely think it's a bubble that's going to pop eventually.
I'm not selling because I see it as a lottery ticket. I already spend the money. If it goes pop it won't hurt my situation. If it doesn't, that'll be a nice surprise.
There's no reason why holding bitcoin suddenly makes you more knowledgeable. Most coiners are arguing their case based on happy thoughts and tin foil hat expectations.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:57:07
So far that's not working out so well as people are learning over and over exactly how meaningless and powerless that really is.
At the end of the day, it just means it became a whole lot easier to fuck everybody over.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:44:29
Exactly. Bitcoins current value is based on hype. Bitcoins eventual value will be based on merit and utility.
That correction is going to nosedive the value and ruin so many people. Not to mention bitcoins reputation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:40:15
We're all here for the money. The main difference is that a lot of people here haven't got a single rational thought on bitcoin but they're total fanatics for it.
As far as I'm concerned the coiner cultists are the one so wrapped up in their fantasies of wealth that they're the detrimental ones. Parasites that inflate the price by hodling instead of using. Eventually causing the bubble that'll ruin them. Poetic almost.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:25:26
I'm pretty sure you don't have the first clue what your taxes are being put towards. You're just so dead set on being a malcontent that you made up your mind.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:10:10
I just pointed out bitcoin and gold are not similar and don't have similar uses.
I don't hold gold because it doesn't suit my purpose. I held bitcoin because I'm interested in the technology and having some keeps me motivated to keep checking in on it.
Ultimately I think there's a bright future for cryptocurrency. But the road to progress is paved with dead pioneers. And bitcoin is turning out to be a great paving stone.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:27:17
The internet really isn't a good comparison. Also, why is it that coiners always seem to resort to the same old tired jab about me not buying back when it was cheap?
It just seems so desperate if you end up reaching for that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:55:12
It's going to be fun watching these guys ride bitcoin all the way into the ground crying about not selling.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:30:47
Nah. I just sold half of mine. Either the bubble finally collapses and I got out more than I put into it. It keeps going and I still have half my bitcoin. Or it dips, I buy again and we'll see what happens next.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:50:58
Ah yeah, making financial decisions based on political leanings. That's not a recipe for disaster at all.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:45:45
And opinions are something you want to exclude as much as possible form your decision-making process in finances.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:08:43
You have the most bizarre arguments. But anyway the joke's over and you're obviously not going to see sense.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:00:43
Probably because hodling is a ridiculously childish attitude and most people with serious investment options aren't stupid enough to let their emotions run the show.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:48:52
Do you have a rational explanation for assuming it'll go to 100k?
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:56:02
I didn't move the goalpost. I was attempting to insert some rationality in here. You sound fucking nuts.
Migrate if you feel so strongly.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:16:50
Work on your reading comprehension then. I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible for you but coiners tend to prefer fairytales anyway. Easier to swallow.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:45:18
I doubt that. It's pretty easy to find out though. He can stop making use of everything his taxes are being put towards and we'll stop making use of the contribution he doesn't want to make anyway.
We'll be nice about him and give him a lift to the city limits so he doesn't accidentally end up using say... roads, the sewer system, social security (I mean he'll likely have a hard time reaching his job now).
Hell, we'll sell off his belongings to cover any back taxes he might have dodged. I mean what's he going to do about it, call the police he doesn't want contribute to?
We'll just keep propping up civilization while he goes and finds a nice cave to live in.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:43:51
I sound like someone who can read statistics. And America's quality of life statistics are pathetic for a Western nation.
You don't have to be a euro-socialist to look at where the leader in the free world stands in regards to things like child mortality rates and feel bad for you guys.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:17:18
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:23:24
You know so much about me, it's amazing. It'd be even more amazing if anything you said was actually correct though.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:31:09
Wait are you talking about Trump? The US economic gains are the effects of Obama's work. Trump's just been trying to wreck shit since he got into office, he hasn't done anything that would affect the economy positively.
As for Trump's business experience, everything the dude touches turns to shit. He could have put his daddy's money into a fund and it would have outperformed him.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:05:41
Is that relevant though? I was holding and tonight got me to sell. This is just bullshit.
It's volatile as hell. Its value is in no way based on merit or utility. It's just a nutso plaything of tinfoil hats, gamblers and whales at this point.
I'm sure it's not done going up. And down. And up. And anywhere else it can but I lost interest for the same reason I don't play slot machines.
I see no sane reason this is going anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:48:40
How is that a solution? Exchange for what, between who?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:56:39
You must be an economic prodigy. But hey, it's nice that you decided to yourself that you paid enough.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:49:48
It's not a problem, welcome to the problem?
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:53:49
Emotion is always the best basis for your financial decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:46:42
You have a very bizarre definition of psycho lunatic.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:45:39
Cute but not applicable.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:29:15
Not paying your taxes is you stealing from the society you live in.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:46:25
So the point is "bet on bitcoin because you might get lucky, just like people who bet on amazon during the .com bubble"?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:16:38
Haha alright. So the country you live in is robbing you. But they do owe you a better one to live in?
It's a little simpler than that. You can be a contributing citizen in the nation you live in or leave and live anywhere else. It's irrelevant if you can find something better or not.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:01:20
This is exactly why bitcoin's bubble will pop eventually. It's value has nothing to do with utility. It's just the uninformed like you and your dad plus the people with enough money to make big swings playing around with numbers.
By the time people realise what a shit show it is, the bubble will pop and bitcoin will drop all the way down to a value based on utility. That'll kill the dream and leave it down there to be forgotten.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:04:00
I'm a realist. I got money in crypto. I also understand there's going to be a time to sell out. And get back in once the value drops to a sustainable number.
If you want to talk about hurting the community, take a look at delusional coiners selling naive people pipe dreams.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:02:19
Alright, I'm going to bow out now. You're just telling yourself more stories and you don't need me for that.
Maybe there can be a spaceship and a robot in your next fairytale.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:42:36
I don't. That doesn't matter though. You're either a citizen or you're not. If you're a citizen who disagrees how your taxes are spent, well you'd best get to work in politics to change things.
If you don't wish to pay your taxes, don't wish to put in an effort to change things and still wish to be a citizen.... well then you're a parasite and a thief of the society that supports you.
And that makes them vermin just the same as the people they cite as the reason they feel taxes are theft.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:45:18
He might have sold them early. He might have been too late to sell after the bubble pops. It doesn't matter really.
His reality was that he was doing fine but he let a potential lost future ruin his very real present to the point where he killed himself.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:23:58
What would your life look like without all of the benefits your and your ancestor's taxes paid for and the benefits you receive from being a citizen?
I doubt there'd be much left of your life.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:31:37
I have a great deal of faith in crypto in general. I want people to get interested in crypto.
I want people to participate in crypto in a well informed, rational and sane way. That in no way describes the prevalent attitude of this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:23:10
Not really. But I will bug out if I finally see the big bubble popping. And I might get back in if it actually stabilizes on a value that's related to utility rather than hot air.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:26:38
Yes and still so unlikely that it's not worth considering.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:10:24
Is this how you deal with a difficult life? Trying to make reality sound like a bad story with villains and tin foil hat theories on how the world works?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:06:16
Nah I sold half. Selling half still got me more than I put into it in the first place.
So I figured either the bubble pops and never recovers, I recoup more than I put into it. It's a dip and I'll buy some more at some point. Or it dives to it's actual value, I recouped my cost and kept some bitcoin to keep the experiment going.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:59:47
They're not arbitrary currencies. They're the currencies that people's lives run on.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:24:35
A non tax paying "citizen" is a despicable parasite.
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:24:52


A vehicle for moving value is a very awkward way of describing pretty much exactly what a currency is.

Are you just repeating your tedious half-baked arguments now?
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:07:26
Pointing at one company among many that actually survived the dot.com bubble and thrived instead of imploding is not a very good argument.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:42:52
When people can't find a rational argument against the initiative, they tend to vilify the agent.
I'm sorry for shitting on your circle jerk on the evils of having to contribute to the society you benefit from. It's always difficult to figure out how to make wanting to be a being a parasite sound good.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:04:38
You pretty much summed up hodlers there. Completely immune to rational thinking.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:08:20
You're hearing it on all day long and virtually none of these hodler's can construct a rational and reasonable argument for their future expectations.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:49:10
Sounds like you don't understand economy then. If 10 people sell bitcoin to 90 others and the value nosedives, you end up with 10 people sitting pretty and 90 people struggling.
It's an extreme example but right now a lot of people who don't understand the first thing about economy, finances or bitcoin are all hyped up about buying bitcoin. This Reddit is full of them.
If bitcoin collapses, it doesn't matter that their dollars are somewhere. They took a hit in their financial position. For a non insignificant number of people, a big hit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:37:45
Because volatility is far more relevant a topic than overall gains. Bitcoin has more utility and trust being stable at 200 than volatile at 20.000.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:35:21
neither do coiners.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:42:16
I love how every coiner keeps saying this. I'm pretty sure barely a tiny fraction of them would be able to pass even a high school economics exam. Never mind a governance one.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:30:53
Err people consent by being citizens and reaping the benefits of living in a civilized nation.
They're welcome to go and live in a cave if it upsets them so much to have a functional infrastructure. Preventing taxes is easy. Just denounce every benefit they grant you, give up being a citizen. Go live outside the society you refuse to contribute to.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:18
I'm not sure how that's relevant to anything I said.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:58:20
Nothing about bitcoin even remotely suggests it's a good idea to just let them ride for years and years as a gift somewhere down the line.
Bitcoin pretty much require daily attention to avoid getting caught up in a bubble. There are zero certainties for bitcoin.
If he wants something to ignore for years there are better options. If the person I replied to simply sold him the hodler fairytale of hold, wait, get rich then he really did that person a disservice.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:27:51
These types of post titles always make me think the writer is a very stupid person thinking they're clever.

Gold does. Nobody mentioned diamonds but that seems to be the problem here. You're constantly looking for a story instead of dealing with reality.
I guess now you're sidetracked by diamonds. Want to tell me a story about those now? Maybe you think I have a chest of diamonds too. It'll make a nice little bridge to trying to spin a story about me having magic beans.

I'm not the one trying to simplify the world into villains and conspiracies to make myself feel better about being bitter and paranoid.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:39:19
Yeah but bitcoin has no real precedent and bitcoin's own history gives exactly zero guarantees or relevant information for it's future.
So to *think* that you're gleaning an educated guess from that... is exactly why there's nothing educated about it.
This is a big problem with bitcoin really. So many investors, advisers, hodler's and whatnot who all think they have it figured out but can't come up with a single rational argument for their future expectations.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:37:45
I don't know what to tell you really. That's completely your own fantasy and doesn't describe me in any way.
I've sold coin exactly once after holding it for years and years.
But hey, like I said. This place runs on people telling themselves fairytales to justify their world view so you fit right in.

I'm pretty sure that started happening a good while ago. Bitcoin's rise in value in no way corresponds to its utility or use.
Get enough hodler parasites buying in and they pretty much have the same effect. A cycle of inflating the price that'll eventually collapse when the sell off happens.

Do you use roads? Do you enjoy your city not being plunged into total darkness at night? Has living in a city that is not an open sewer improved your life expectancy? Do you appreciate the fact that people can't rape or murder your family with impunity? Do you appreciate the economic benefits extorted from the world at large by having the most powerful military in the world? Do you understand that most of these incredibly obvious yet life-changing examples barely scratch the surface?
Then you, my complaining friend, might actually be getting more benefits from your taxes that you give them credit for.
And as always, I would absolutely love to see you go and live a tax-free life by denouncing every single benefit they grant you. I'm sure someone will give you a lift to the city limits so you don't accidentally step onto one of those tax sucking roads or sidewalks.

The US has some of the lowest taxes of any Western nation I know of. I'm Dutch and our lowest income tax rate is at 37%. I'm at 41% and the wealthiest pay 52%. We don't nearly have the highest income tax in Europe. Our none income taxes tend to be higher too.
I don't find your income tax percentage absurd. I do find the politicians who govern your nation and spend your taxes to be absurd though.

Except that's an extremely dubious statement, even going by his own explanation.
Bitcoin being as volatile as it currently is, makes it an absolutely terrible *information carrier for economic data than any traditional currency*. A dataset that is so mutable in what it represents in such short time periods is worthless data.
Bitcoin's overhead is absolutely not negligible. Between the current energy demands and the transaction fees, it's pretty much the opposite of low overhead.
This is not an awesome post. This just just another person shovelling bullshit while passing it off as wisdom.

Oh I understand perfectly well. I just don't believe in the end goal for bitcoin. I'm not some coiner cultist.
I see money to be made on the short term. And utility to be had on the long term after the value crashes to a level that corresponds to utility.
In the mean time I'm not getting carried away by all the silly pipe dreams and paranoia involved in being a coiner.

Get as many people to buy in as you can to drive the price up. Then sell your own. After the resulting price crash, look if it's worth buying back at the lower price.

You're talking about finances. Being a fan or any emotion for that matter has no place in it.
I think bitcoin's high fees are getting in the way of its own utility. The constant infighting and forking attempt just highlight the inherent weakness and flaws in bitcoin's overall integrity though.
It's not about bitcoin or bitcoin cash. The only relevant thing about that whole mess to me is how easy it is to sow division, manipulate the value and how volatile the whole system is. That's the important information there.

Work on it. That's all there is to it.
Mindfulness has become a buzzword but it really boils down to making an effort to become aware when you're upsetting yourself with regrets and hypotheticals. And making an effort each day to cut through the bullshit and remind yourself of the things you're grateful for that actually happened instead of might happen.
At the end of the day, life is what's happening to you right now. And it's easy to miss by dwelling on the past or the many things that *might* happen in the future.

That's the same advice you get for investments anywhere else really. Diversifying means making sure your money isn't simply spread around various investments, it's making sure it's spread around various industries.
There's plenty of factors that will affect an entire industry and it won't matter if you're invested in two oil companies so to speak. So invest in the energy and health industry for instance.
Along the same line, investing in both bitcoin and ethereum won't cover your ass if there's national or global regulation on cryptocurrencies coming that tank their value.

Bitcoin wasn't made to be a store of value. It was made to be a currency.
Gold by its natural properties is an excellent store of value and the way its value behaves on the market reflects that.
The value of gold has an inverse relationship with how well large economies are doing.
The value of bitcoin is largely related to how well the media is talking about it and large sums of it being moved around by whales.
One of the key things a store of value needs is a very predictable indicator of how others value your store in the future once you want to get rid of it. That's pretty much the opposite of bitcoin.

It kind of has. You're living in it. No system is perfect and there's nothing so silly as criticizing an imperfect working system for not being a 100% efficient fantasy. There's nothing wrong with taxes in principle. They're essential for a functioning nation. The difficult part is spending taxes rationally.
Let's say you want fewer taxes. You'd probably end up looking at Republican representation. Ultimately they're the ones who make a big show out of wanting more tax breaks, less government oversight and so on.
Generally speaking, they're staunchly opposed to too many taxes. But they're huge on wasting the taxes the nation does receive on detrimental initiatives or giving the biggest tax breaks to corporate entities whose interests directly oppose those of the people.

Can't speak for America but over here the state simply points out that if you have a fortune (ie money, gold, jewels etc.) then that fortune should earn you money (interest, investment, value increase etc.)
So every year you're supposed to declare your fortune and you pay taxes over a percentage of the earnings your fortune should have earned you.
If your money is just stuffed in a sock instead of earning interest, that's just poor personal finance management and not the state's problem.
Incidentally if you're just keeping large sums of money stacked up in a room where it's actually devaluing due to inflation instead of earning you interest. You got bigger problems than the minor amount of tax the government would levy.

You're supposed to pay capital gains tax and gold and silver when you sell. The IRS suspects rather a lot of people are not paying taxes on their earnings when they sell bitcoin. I don't find that unlikely.


Because it benefits himself and his cronies the most and he couldn't care less what damage he does to the nation and the people while he makes sure he takes care of his own. The man is a parasite.


Trump and the republicans are by far the most corrupt component of the US government you've ever seen. Not to mention the most self serving entity out to shamelessly and intentionally fuck the American people and the rest of the world for their own personal benefit as much as they possibly can.
At this point, Trump and his party are past simply corrupt and self serving and well into enemy of humanity territory with the shit they're pulling.


Feel free to start living your life without any of the benefits your tax money pays for or you're entitled to as a tax paying citizen.

I'm not American and I know you guys pay a lot less taxes. But over here you owe taxes over your complete fortune. It's irrelevant where you store your fortune whether it's in a bank or under your couch.
Obviously it's a lot easier to simply never mention the stack of gold coins in your basement but as far as the law is concerned, that gold is still part of your fortune and you're supposed to pay taxes over it.
Of the top of my head it works something like... your fortune can earn you money (interest, investing etc.) so you pay taxes over a percentage of the average your fortune could have earned you over the year.
Failure to declare that is tax evasion. Failure to make money with your fortune is simply poor personal finance.

Hey I like bitcoins, I like the ease of using it. But at the end of the day, they're most useful when the vendor uses some kind of service that converts my currency into bitcoin to conduct the trade before immediately converting them back into his currency at the other end.
Such services tend to take a little bit of the top as a fee for facilitating the transfer. Something bitcoin itself was hoping to prevent by having people simply use bitcoin without all the conversion stuff.
Which really means that at the end of the day, I wasn't looking for bitcoin but a better transaction service. Neither party had any interest in bitcoin, only an interest in avoiding the more atrocious transaction services around.

There's several ways of investing in gold. Roughly split between buying physical gold (coins, bars etc.) and buying paper ownership of gold that sits in a vault somewhere and you'll never see it (gold bonds).
The advantage to buying paper ownership is that it's quick, easy and secure. You never have to worry about someone breaking into your house and stealing your gold. Nor do you have to worry about paying for purity testing when selling your gold.
The downside is that this system is only secure while society is secure. A lot of people point out that part of the appeal of gold is that it's a good personal reserve.
If for instance war broke out, you could sew your gold coins into the lining of your jacket while you flee. If your gold sat in a vault somewhere out of your reach, your paper ownership is now worthless.
Whether that's paranoid or wise is up for discussion.

It's not a sound investment. It's not a usable currency. Pretty much the only use it has at the moment is acting as a transfer medium.

I suppose concern is the wrong word but bitcoin wants to be a currency.  Like you say, gold is a store of value.
Bitcoin wants to move, it wants to be spend and right now a lot of people are hoarding, hoping it'll hold or increase in value. Even a lot of vendors accepting bitcoin seem to be in a hoarding state of mind. I know several who accept bitcoin as a means of payment but neither spend it nor convert it to conventional currency. They simply hang on to it saying a pizza is a cheap trade if bitcoin explodes second time.
All of the above is not conductive to having bitcoin act as a currency.
I love cryptocurrency for the way they solve a lot of transaction issues of online trade (assuming it all works as intended). Near infinite divisibility combined with zero or negligible transaction costs is a great thing.
People refusing to actually spend it because the value fluctuates rather wildly and everyone is hoping to make money *off their bitcoins* instead of using them as money throws a spanner in the works.

The main problem I've had with gold and one that never got addressed to my satisfaction is that gold bugs always refer to it's historic stability.
Historic being the key word. The world changed more in the last 50 years than the 2000 before that. I appreciate that gold has been stable because it's a noble element that doesn't degrade and there's only a limited quantity of it on earth.
But in our current climate of incredibly rapid change and progress that doesn't inspire confidence in me. New tech might find and reach large new gold deposits. Space exploration and mining might find nigh unlimited supplies in space. We might find ways to synthesise the element (alchemy ho!).
Progress is moving so fast that I don't trust in an element that bases it's value on "We can't... find more / make more / unearth more". We got pretty good at turning can't into can.
I'm not hugely confident in bitcoin either but bitcoin bases it's value in "we can" instead of "we can't".

I'm not sure that's a good thing really. As far as I can tell this is possible because merchants have become bitcoin parasites rather than using bitcoin as a currency.
Ie. most of them simply use services that convert bitcoin back to traditional currency never touch actually touching bitcoin, placing all conversion costs on you. This does bitcoin no good and you're really just overpaying for things since some exchange agent is making money of you. 
Or they act like cash-for-gold type businesses that offer their very low overhead products (ie. pizza) for bitcoin, hoping to hoard the stuff on the cheap in case it ever shoots up in value.
I've pretty much seen no merchants who actually treat bitcoin as currency by accepting and spending it as if it were money.

In voting the most common argument is that you can vote for the guy you really like but voting for the little guy is like throwing away your vote.
And that is also true. The more niche a politician is, the harder it is for him to push his agenda because there's only going to be a limited number of people who agree with him completely. Voting for him is effectively throwing your vote away because he's never going to make it to power.
Voting effectively mostly means voting for one of the big guys who actually stand a chance of doing something. Even if you don't agree with his entire agenda.
Or increasingly likely, it means voting *against* the people you really don't want to see in power. A sucks but B is absolutely terrible, let's vote A then.

You're missing the point entirely. If the majority if bitcoin holders save instead of spend, which is what seems to be happening. Bitcoin might as well not exist as far as shopkeepers are concerned.
Investing in payment methods that people mostly ignore is simply not interesting.
And on the flip side, bitcoin is still so volatile that the only reason to actually spend it would be novelty. It's insanity to use a currency that fluctuates in value over the course of 24 hours as much as bitcoin does.

Why exactly? Right now I have 0.07 bitcoins in my wallet, that's about 40 euros worth off the top of my head. 
Every night I open my wallet software while I work and over the course of an evening the value of my bitcoins sometimes fluctuates by 5 euros.
On such a small amount that's huge, that's a fluctuation of over 12%. It seems ridiculous to spend a resource so unstable that it fluctuates by that kind of margin over a few hours.
It always stabilises around 40 euro's but imagine the reaction you'd get if people's bank saldo's would go up and down like that. I got a thousand dollars... no wait it's eight hundred... wait it's eight fifty... hold on a moment, I'll have enough money to pay you soon but you'll have to be quick before it goes down again.

Flood the market, drop the value, combine it with a smear campaign to go "see the bubble is already collapsing!".

That's the point isn't it. People don't buy gold to use as currency. People buy gold because while it fluctuates, it more or less holds or increases in value over time.
People buy volatile stocks to bet on the fact that it's going to blow up short term and make them a lot of money.
Both of those things is exactly what you don't want a currency to do. And bitcoin is exhibiting exactly that kind of behaviour. It fluctuates too much to be a good daily currency and people are still hoping it'll be a good value store like gold which is making them disinclined to spend it all unless it increases in value.
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:53:23

Until I realized that my bitcoin literally halved in value since I bought it. There didn't seem to be a point in buying a second hand game if I spend an amount of bitcoin that I paid more for than the game would have cost brand new.

Maybe it'll be governments. Maybe it'll be a commercial service. Maybe it'll be a conglomerate of corporations.

Never mind the batshit insane premise of the world has to fail for bitcoin to succeed. Which was kind of my point in the first place.

@_date: 2017-02-21 15:47:41
I don’t see it as pessimism really. At the end of the day bitcoin is a product. Products succeed when they’re easy to adopt and thus achieve mass appeal. Bitcoin is not easy to adopt, in fact it is so difficult and risky to use that there’s a proliferation of services that’ll let you buy bitcoin or accept bitcoin payments more easily in exchange for a fee. That’s not good advertising for a product marketed as getting around organisations that facilitate your financial transactions in exchange for a fee.
Anyway if you accept that bitcoin is a product and products get accepted more easily if they’re easy to use, easy to understand, and trustworthy… then it’s not a big leap to accept that there’s rather a lot of entities far more capable of launching a product that does everything bitcoin does in a much more user friendly way.
And the final problem is trust. Money is important. For the average Joe money means security, it’s their income, their livelihood you’re talking about. Whoever is going to manage their financial transactions needs trust. They don’t have to be liked, few people love their bank. But they do need to be trusted to the point where the user feels he won’t be screwed any more than he contractually agreed to.
I don’t think any government, corporation or organisation in the world is going to endorse bitcoin over developing their own controlled digital currency.
In order to gain mass appeal Bitcoin is betting on the world getting ruined in such a specific way that there’s nobody left to offer a better alternative while simultaneously leaving all the infrastructure and permission in place for bitcoin to fill the void. That’s a very bizarre scenario.
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:33:30

I expect that eventually, we'll have some hybrid form. Honestly, as I see bitcoin right now it's a technology that's getting used in a lot of ways except the way it should be.
* People are speculating on bitcoin, hoping for another bubble to sell their coins in
* People are using bitcoin as a money transfer service, quickly converting currency into bitcoin, sending and converting back again
* Exchanges are selling bitcoin for a fee, nulling the promise of freedom from intermediaries who levy fees. Sure it's voluntary but clearly people need the added easy of use.
* Vendors are accepting bitcoin payments without ever holding bitcoins. Employing services that convert bitcoins to traditional currency while passing the fee on to the user.
* Various parties are using bitcoin as a value store to evade taxes and oversight on shady financial practices.
Those are all reasons bitcoin is currently still in operation. None of those are good reasons for the general public to accept bitcoin or for authorities/governments/industry to tolerate bitcoin.
Now on the flipside:
* Blockchain technology is great. It adds a lot of robustness to any important data set by eliminating obvious points of failure like data centers.
* I don't know about the US but here in Europe, we've been talking about going fully digital for a while now. Nothing bitcoin related, just phasing out coins and bills while people use their bank accounts and debit cards. So one way or another, digital currency is on it's way.
* What people want out of a digital currency is ease of use, reliability, credibility. It doesn't matter how it works behind the scenes but people want to know their money isn't going to disappear because someone is accountable. Their value won't fluctuate wildly on a daily basis. They want to know where the support number is to call for help when something is unclear. And so on.
* Governments and corporations want the same transparency. People shouldn't be able to hide their wealth and so on and so on.
Anyway, my point is that I have no idea what the final result will look like. Most likely a combination of technologies and levels of access. What I do know is that the parties involved are juggernauts. Slow to react now, unstoppable by the time they care enough to do something.
For bitcoin to succeed completely, every better alternative needs to fail. If that were to happen, bitcoin would be the last thing on anyone's mind. If things got that bad, I certainly wouldn't want my wealth in a digital format that requires a running network to be usable.

@_date: 2017-02-21 15:36:30
That makes no sense though. Essentially what I’m saying is bitcoin will fail either way. Cryptocurrency needs mass acceptance if it is to grow beyond what it is right now. The proliferation of services that makes bitcoin easier to buy and easier to use for a fee demonstrates perfectly where it’s falling short.
The funny thing is that bitcoin is good at something that people don’t care about. It’s really bad at everything people do care about. Which is why there’s such a proliferation of exchanges and vendor services that try to make bitcoins easier to use for a fee. Ironically for mainstream users that destroys the promise that bitcoin will free you from banks and other institutions that levy fees in order to let you manage your finances. All it succeeded in is shifting the financial management from a reasonably well regulated industries to a wild west of pioneering services.
What Bitcoin needs for success is a centralised effort to provide a very tightly directed and simplified user experience as well as the entire personal support and accountability structure that people expect of any organisation that they trust with their financial transactions. Essentially exactly what bitcoin is intended not to be.
Blockchain technology has a strong future. Bitcoin does not. As soon as the investment is worth it, some or multiple entities will develop bitcoin-like currencies with none of the self sufficiency and privacy and all of the user friendliness and customer service that bitcoin lacks. Further more I predict that it will require a massive endorsement by an authority that doesn’t have to be liked, but does have to be trusted to be “too big to fall” simply because people can’t afford to have the system processing their livelihood to fall. And that means either governments or some kind of corporate construction.
Bitcoin itself won’t be more than a footnote for tech buffs and historians. The difference between bitcoin and whatever digital currency will succeed is the difference between Graham Bell’s telephone and a functional global telecommunication infrastructure. One is a proof of concept, the other is a functional product that people need.
Bitcoin is it’s own worst enemy in the sense that it shows the world and bitcoin’s competitors how to do it right by example of doing it wrong. It demonstrates all the potential without any of the qualities it needs to succeed in achieving mass acceptance.
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:46:07
It's accepted because most of those places never see a single Bitcoin. Their payment services take the users Bitcoin and pay the company in regular currency.
The service provider doesn't mind doing this because they take a slice from the top during conversion. Just like the service provider who likely sold the Bitcoin to the user in the first place.

As far as I can tell the single biggest influence on bitcoin value is media attention and hype. There's not a situation in the world where that's good.
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:57:10
For me the outcome I predicted is based on the very simple fact that it’s not difficult to envision a digital currency that can succeed. It’s a combination of user friendliness, reliability, trust and endorsement by entities who’ll make people feel comfortable switching from traditional to digital.
I find it very difficult to believe however that when the world is ready for this digital currency, there’s no entity that can’t outcompete bitcoin in all of those arenas. The general public cares very little about bitcoin’s specific features and very much about all of those areas bitcoin can’t compete in.
Frankly I think physical money is slowly going to phase out in favour of completely digital money in our traditional banking systems. And purely digital money will eventually quietly phase into blockchain type technology with varying degrees of control by whatever entity controls the system.
Bitcoin was hoping for a revolution with a bang. In reality I expect a series of barely noticeable technology transitions.

From what I can tell it's biggest value at the moment is for people who need to transfer money. I'm seeing a lot of people who use it as a peer to peer money transfer service with minimal conversion and service rates compared to many traditional services.
Generalizing a bit but I've noticed there's three main groups of bitcoin users:
* Hoarders, people who stack bitcoin, hoping for another bubble to make a bundle.
* Exchangers, people who don't care about bitcoin but see a cheap way to send money, only keeping their money in bitcoin form for the duration of the transaction.
* Believers, people who actually believe in the system and want it to succeed. I noticed their arguments are often based more on idealism or hatred of established systems than rational arguments.
The other thing I noticed is that in a lot of ways people have false hopes for bitcoin. For instance:
* Users cheer anytime another store or franchise starts accepting bitcoin. The reality is that these franchises haven't started accepting bitcoin. They've retained services that allow users to pay them in bitcoin through a third party service that turns the bitcoin back into dollars before the store ever touches it. They pay a small fee for that but that's nothing new, they also do that for credit card, debit card, paypal and similar transactions. In the end, the store is taking your money, not your bitcoin. All the risk of owning bitcoin still lies with the user as well as the cost of the exchange service provider involved.
* Users applaud the fact that bitcoin is free of the influence of the evil banks and all their service charges. Funny thing is that most people obtain their bitcoin through service providers that do levy a fee, integrated into the cost of buying bitcoin. Along the same lines, most bitcoin payments made to businesses again incorporate a fee to pay for the service provider handling the exchange. It's really not that different from say banks or paypal, even though the rates are currently lower.
* Bitcoin isn't regulated at the moment because it isn't worth the effort required to regulate. As soon as that changes it'll be regulated heavily. Nobody is going to put up with an unregulated shadow economy when that system could be taxed by governments, riddled with fees by corporations, monitored by law enforcement and influenced by businesses in the money exchange and lending sector. 
And in the end users don't yet realize how user friendly bitcoin would have to be in order to even be viable for mainstream. At the moment debit cards have become so simple that people can simple tap them against payment machines to make a payment and draw cash from ubiquitous ATM machines. That's the ease of use needed for mass appeal.
Mainstream users don't want to hear about the block chain, value fluctuation, mining and so on. You *cannot* explain to people that their bitcoin stash might let them buy a hamburger today but not tomorrow. People don't even like understanding inflation where money changes value over the course of years instead of days.
But at the end of the day, current cryptocurrencies don't behave like currency, aren't used like currency and don't look like they'll fill the role of proper currency anytime soon. You can use it, it can even be very convenient but you have to put in the effort to use it safely and properly with the appropriate expectations.
And effort is the magic word that mainstream acceptance doesn't want to hear.

That's because bitcoin users keep a mindset that equates the two concepts.

They're just looking at the future potential of models like this, bitcoin is just that forgotten application that demonstrated blockchain systems.

The only reason Gox's problems had such an impact is because people want the good without the bad.
One moment people are cheering that they finally have an oversight free currency, the next they're crying because they lost money when things go wrong with those they (foolishly) entrust with their oversight free currency.
The main advantage of bitcoin is fairly easy, fee free, digital transactions. Except those transactions are silly because bitcoin's value fluctuates too wildly to be usable as currency. At least in a sensible manner.
How is that value going to stabilise? No idea considering it's a finite resource that is being mined. So far it's acting more like gold than currency, with people hoarding the stuff hoping to either recover their losses or make a profit. 
In the mean time I can't spend mine in a sane manner because whether or not I can afford things depends on the time of day. Like everyone else i'm hanging on to see if I'm going to recover my losses but if it does rise I'll hang on to see where it levels out. If it levels out instead of just yoyo'ing again.
I like the idea but you can't blame all of bitcoins problems on gox and I don't see a bright future yet where the stuff has widespread practical use.

How do you figure there's no middleman? Most businesses accepting bitcoin never, ever want to see a bitcoin under any circumstances and simply use a service that takes your bitcoin, converts it to regular currency, takes out a fee (that get's passed on to you) and hands over the actual money to the vendor.
The main reason retail bitcoin acceptance is happening at all is because there's no risk in it for vendors. You have money you want to spend, there's services that'll allow them to take that money without the risk involved in holding bitcoin. All vendors need to decide is whether or not the sales volume is worth effort in setting it up.
And the fees involved are no problem either. Pretty much any payment method except cash involves fees that are already passed on to the customer so bitcoin conversion fees are no different.
The only reason bitcoin in retail is getting any acceptance at all is because of the middlemen.

Gold is a good store of value because it doesn't undergo significant rapid value change under normal circumstances. When gold value does change it has an inverse relationship to the financial market.
Gold doesn't degrade, rot, corrode etc. and we know there's a finite supply on earth. That gives gold a pretty stable value. One the one hand that means gold is a relatively safe place to put your money long term. On the other hand, it means gold is a poor investment, you can't expect gold to give a steady rate of return. It doesn't earn interest, it doesn't earn dividends.
So when the financial market is stable and thus predictable, a diversified investment portfolio will help your money make money for you. You invest in successful ventures and you get paid a dividend. During these times gold won't increase in value much or even drop value slightly.
During uncertain times, for instance, because there's a war going on, investments become less attractive because they're riskier. During these times the price of gold goes up, because it's still a relatively safe place to store your wealth until things calm down.
If you have tons of money, the usual advice is to invest a significant part of it so that your money starts earning money. And you invest the remainder in very stable assets like gold or real estate. That way you can't lose all your wealth in a market crash.
Bitcoin has many labels. Some people consider it a form of speculation, hoping for anothe bubble where they can sell high. Others consider it a form of value store and assume that fluctuations aside, bitcoin will always rise in the long run. Yet others keep trying to turn bitcoin into a currency, always spending it.
But as events keep demonstrating, bitcoin is so volatile that it experiences massive value fluctuations based on just a bit of media attention alone. As far as I'm concerned bitcoin is an early experiment in cryptocurrency and likely not the one that'll eventually gain supremacy.
That makes investing in bitcoin pure day trading and speculation. You might make out like a bandit, you might lose everything you have. But it's never a safe bet. And that makes it worthless to anyone except people who can afford to gamble with large sums of money and not care about the outcome.
@_date: 2016-01-29 16:51:22
It's still not a hedge, just because you choose a banana republic as your paranoid example doesn't mean bitcoin is suddenly stable enough to be a sensible hedge choice.

Apple's closed ecosystem is a huge part of why they've been so successful though. From macro to micro their product offering is designed around the very simple idea that people don't know what they want but they'll love you if you give them what you need.
One of the best things Steve did for Apple for instance was limiting their product offering to more or less one of each. One laptop, one desktop computer, one phone, one tablet etc. Along the same lines OSx and iOS lack the surface customizability of say Windows or Linux but spend a great deal of effort to make sure the experience is so smooth most average users never feel the need to customize the OS as they would feel for Windows or Linux. There's a lot of interesting TED talks on how too much choice makes people unhappy.
If bitcoin wants to be a success, that kind of simplicity would be key. The vast majority of users doesn't give a crap about pretty much every banner subject surrounding Bitcoin. Mainstream success for bitcoin needs the following things:
* Nobody wants to own bitcoin. A bitcoin transfer means instantly taking traditional currency out of your checking account, converting it to bitcoin and paying. Nobody even wants to know this is happening. 
* Payments are safe, instant, free of service charges, interest, and no money lost on value fluctuation.
* Payments are no more difficult than tapping a button or making NFC contact. If credit cards or debit cards are easier than bitcoin, bitcoin will never see mainstream success.
One of the most telling things about bitcoin is how most interest goes out to the blockchain technology itself. The general public doesn't give a shit about bitcoin because it's too mutable and complicated to be practical. Most corporations and organisations don't give a shit about bitcoin because the only valuable part is the distributed blockchain concept which can be used for any distributed data model. Bitcoin itself can just drop dead and disappear for all most people care, it's the blockchain technology that's interesting.

If you haven't had this experience I feel like your buyers have been had. Unless you're dealing in paper gold that doesn't leave it's vault or in gold so steeped in trusted security measures like Canadian Maples, gold simply isn't trustworthy unless it's purity is verified during the sales process which is normally done at the expense of the seller.
So either you sold trusted gold by the means described or your buyers took a massive risk buying physical gold from you. One that no intelligent gold buyer would take.
@_date: 2016-06-16 11:51:14
What happened to the default bitcoin attitude of unregulated trade and finances are awesome?
@_date: 2016-06-16 11:50:13
Sure it could. If you run a bigger risk of losing it than the other party, the risk/reward ratio is higher when you hold on to it. There was a big fire in my town in a predominantly Arab neighbourhood a couple of years ago. Rather a lot of gold melted some of which literally ran off into the sewer. Nowhere near all of it was recovered and establishing ownership afterwards was impossible. 
Similarly if holding on to something devalues it significantly, it doesn't make sense to hold on to it. For instance there's only a relatively small number of gold sources that make sense to physically hold. Mostly stuff like Canadian Maple coins that have so many security features that they're hard to forge. Just any old gold will lose you a ton of money when you try to sell as you're responsible for having purity tests and such performed on your gold.
Silver is another common investment metal but in many European countries you pay value added tax over it because it has industrial applications. Silver is still a good investment but only if you leave the silver in vaults without moving it. Actually buying physical silver loses you money on the tax you pay.

Studied corporate administration, worked as an accountant.
People stories are messy and thus irrelevant. Money trails are clear. If you take an account that was used by a poor person for years it sets a certain pattern, plunk 50k into it and then start making large withdrawals... that breaks the pattern. That's going to raise eyebrows and questions.
The fact that it takes a long time to resolve has nothing to do with any evil conspiracy or antagonizing poor people. It's just that the pattern is interesting enough to ask and resolve some questions but asking questions involves a sufficient number of people and communication lines that it's slow going when the questions aren't a priority.
Then again, if you're cuckoo enough to use words like 'overlord' I doubt you care about a bit of rationality.

It's not the middle ages, accurate scales are by no means sufficient for dealing in gold. Fake gold bullion with a 75% tungsten core wrapped in a thin layer of gold are so common these days that most reputable gold dealers will start their verification process with an x-ray of the bullion. You won't catch those just by weighing stuff on a scale.
For a private individual there's really only two ways of safely owning physical gold:
* Buy gold from extremely reputable dealers who incorporate all of these checks into their process. And even then only buy gold in forms rarely forged like Canadian Maples (the one ounce weight units are hardly worth forging and the coins are very hard to make an undetectable forgery off). It's not fool proof but forgeries are usually of bullion bars rather than well known and easy to examine coins.
* Collect scrap gold until you have enough to send them out to a trusted forge and have it turned into bullion for you. There's a lot of expense involved in this method and your eventual buyer is going to require you to have it tested for purity and content all over again when you sell.
Another thing worth mentioning is that gold is a terrible short term investment. Gold is interesting as a hedge against market fluctuations over long periods of time (10+ years). Sure you can earn short term gains on gold, especially around major economic upheaval like major wars or things like Brexit but it's risky and laborious. The real advantage in gold is that you can hang on to it for decades safe in the knowledge that it's value won't change significantly.
Gold bugs and other fringe people aside, most people own gold to balance out riskier investments. Ie. put part of your fortune in more volatile investments with bigger payoffs, put the rest in gold where it's relatively safe. This is especially useful because in broad lines gold tends to go up when the stock market or global economy tends to go down and vice versa.

Take care of yourself first. Investments usually aren’t worth it until you’ve got a significant savings buffer that is readily available to deal with emergencies like unemployment, home repair and so on. That money should be both immediately available (not locked up in investments or long term savings) and not volatile (ie. bitcoin, schemes etc.)
If you got money to spend, pay off your debts first. You pay a lot more in interest on your debts than you can expect to earn from most forms of investments. Once you’re done with that it can be worth it to spend that money on long lasting goods instead of keeping it saved up. If you own a house or car, do the maintenance that needs doing. 
Look into personal investments that make sense like home insulation, water saving measures, perhaps solar panels are a smart choice in your area and situation. Essentially if your saving’s interest doesn’t beat inflation it doesn’t make sense to keep more savings than you need to deal with emergencies, but it does make sense to take advantage of the slump and take care of problems that’ll cause you to incur costs in the (near) future or will retain value over time.
If you have any other opportunities in life like a 401k matching plan at work or something like that, invest in that. It’s hard to beat returns like having your employer match your retirement savings.
If you still have a significant chunk of money left over after that, you can look into investing or speculating in other ways. It’s not very exciting but the truth is that short term speculation in things like stocks or bitcoin is hardly more than gambling. It’s fine if you do it with money you can afford to lose but otherwise not very smart.
Along the same lines, long term investing portfolios can be worth it if you have the patience and the budget. People often hope for a quick buck and end up trading with such small budgets that most of their earnings are devoured by fees while they still run all the risk involved. If your budget is under 5-10k, don’t even think about investing.
Gold is cute as a store of value. The nice thing about gold is that it tends to have an inverse relationship to economic turmoil. Ie. when the economy runs great, people invest to hitch a ride on the success of industry. When the economy goes bad and everything else goes down, gold tends to go up as people jump ship into the stability of gold. That said, since gold remains fairly stable, it doesn’t makes sense to buy and sell gold a lot. It’s a long term thing, a hedge against your other financial plans. So, just like stocks, gold doesn’t make sense unless you have a significant amount of money to invest for a long time…. alongside your existing plans.
Unless you’re willing to gamble, there’s few things in life that’ll pay off like simply being responsible, staying out of debt, keeping up with your maintenance and taking advantage of letting low risk, long term earnings add up. People here tend to be so greedy and hopeful they completely blind themselves to the reality of things. Don’t get carried away.
There’s a reason the finance sector play’s with other people’s money instead of their own. Unless you have a significant surplus of money, it makes no sense to speculate and gamble.

If you want to put some money in it and ride the wave to see if you can make some profit fine. But treat it like gambling of any other kind. Don't put money in it that you can't afford to lose. And for the love of god, don't put everything you own into it.
Diversifying just means spreading your money around so it's unlikely all of your ventures fail at the same time. That idea has nothing to do with stocks.

Gold is a stable store of value because it’s a physical item of limited availability that literally doesn’t corrode or otherwise diminish in anyway. Gold is stable, there’s a finite supply of it on earth that isn’t going to change in any significant way. The value might fluctuate somewhat according to demand but money invested in gold is relatively stable and slow to change value.
By comparison, bitcoin is one of the most fluid commodities around. It has no real world presence whatsoever. It claims to be a currency yet it’s value bounces up and down like a rubber ball in a trampoline factory. It’s worth isn’t determined by any immutable physical principles like gold, instead it changes value on whims, trends and headlines.
I’m not favouring either gold or bitcoin really. They aren’t comparable in any way though and trying to teach the uninitiated that they are is just disingenuous. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:09:26
He's talking about the vanity of value of having a private key that indicates you got in during the early days of bitcoin. Some people care about prestige things like that and will pay for it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:46:09
I can actually because unlike bitcoin gold is pretty well established. The primary reason gold has always been a store of value lies in it's physical properties.
There's a limited supply of it on earth. It's chemical properties mean it won't corrode, decompose or otherwise diminish in any way. That makes gold very stable.
Unlike bitcoin, which has no physical presence at all. It's valued just zooms all over the place based on nothing more than public perception. 
Gold will always be gold. If gold's not doing well, bury it in the ground in a box and 50 years later it'll represent the same portion of the earth's supply of gold. Bitcoin will never be more than an ethereal fabrication that can be deleted, manipulated, regulated, outlawed, or simply replaced by something more acceptable to any authority who cares.
As far as I'm concerned bitcoin is a bubble. It's a fad that you can make money off now even though it's not intended to be used like that. Sooner or later something better comes along, people will stop caring, authorities will start caring or any other reason will cause that bubble to pop and bitcoin will be forgotten and worthless at the drop of a hat.
There's absolutely nothing about bitcoin that suggests it's "the new paradigm". It's just a pioneer enjoying a bubble.
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:33:04
You didn't like the exact properties that made gold a good hedge? The same properties that bitcoin is completely missing?
It seems like madness to consider bitcoin a safe hedge, there's absolutely no certainty there. It's like trying to hedge against risk by taking a bigger risk.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:41:54
Based on what exactly? I'm not the one trying to mislead people by making shitty comparisons between gold and bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:34:09
I haven't changed position once. I'm just replying to the storm of irrational shit all these upset coiners are throwing out. So yeah the subject changes a lot since there doesn't seem to be a single one with a sensible argument.
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:00:55
A metaphor for what? You're not actually making a point.
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:21:23
what you're really saying is "I managed to actually make money off bitcoin instead of a loss".
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:25:28
Honestly if you need to clarify a statement like that, you shouldn't be making statements in the first place.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:34:39
I don't see any reason to assume growl will fix any of them. It won't change the nature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:04:58
Treat it like gambling. It's rising in value but there's no strong reason to assume it'll stay that way or retain any value at all.
Feel free to ride the wave but be ready to pull out or lose your money.

Maybe they should change their homepage then.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:17:49
Doesn't have the adoption to do that? Although there was plenty of whining when gox blew up. It was pretty funny watching people cry and whine about the lack of oversight after spending the past few years touting that as one of the advantages of bitcoin.
When's the last time the dollar did that? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:32:08
It's nice that Satoshi does that but that doesn't mean it's not meaningless bullshit.
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:43:30
It takes a lot more for that to happen than for public perception to affect the value of bitcoin. Which seems to be a weekly occurrence.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:16:20


That's why they're popular with tin foil hats, coiners and criminals. It's one of the reasons they don't have mainstream appeal. Remember how many people cried about the lack of oversight when Gox blew up?

heh well, thanks for the laugh I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:24:31
People like gold because it's the opposite of bitcoin. It would be very strange if people held similar opinions about the two.
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:29:38
Yeah but that's insanity. The value of bitcoin fluctuates so badly that it makes no sense to use it as spending money.
You might as well roll dice every time you buy something to see if you'll pay double or nothing.
There's a reason bitcoin describes itself as currency yet coiners have "Hold!" as their battle cry. The only thing bitcoin is good for right now is speculating on the value and hoping you win.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:22:22
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. It just doesn't seem relevant.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:50:11
Again, nothing was said that even warrants a serious response. It's a ridiculous point to make and I'm certainly not going to concede to it because you namedrop someone.
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:38:28
More importantly, don't stick it all in bitcoin. The worst thing you can do with any investment is going all in on a single gamble.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:50:28
They're almost polar opposites, it's a reasonable analogy if you want to completely mislead your audience.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:03:42
I'm still amazed you thought I was actually going to agree with you when you haven't made a single argument.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:43:29
Honestly I haven't heard a single sensible counter argument.
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:20:40
The interesting part for me is that in order to make money of bitcoin you have to be an active contributor to it's eventual failure. It's such an interesting concept.
@_date: 2016-11-16 22:44:37
Why do coiners always come up with these tinfoil hat ways of responding to everything?
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:15:17
Checkpoints suggest it can't drop back down just as fast.
@_date: 2016-12-01 12:55:40
If you read my original point you'd realise that's a very rare thing you're asking for.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:07:54
I have, that's why I'm so surprised the arguments in favour usually boil down to wishful thinking and paranoia.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:12:20
I love all these offended clueless replies I'm getting.
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:45:32
You got a very casual definition of massive if you want to compare bitcoin to the dollar's fluctuation.
@_date: 2017-08-28 07:34:03
That doesn't change the fact that the network transaction fees are exorbitant. I wanted to take some 25 euros in bitcoin out of my coinbase account. The fees amount to 4.20 euros.
Bitcoin is worse than banks at this point when it comes to fees.
@_date: 2016-11-13 12:41:07
Yep, but most things have a considerably better basis for stable public perception.
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:32:44


That's the crux of it isn't it. Whether or not people value bitcoin fluctuates rather badly and it's influenced heavily by very fluid things like media attention. I can't think of a worse base for value really unless you want to start minting Trump Dollars.
Honestly when coiners point at crashing nation states they usually have to resort to pointing at African warzones and failing dictatorships. If you have to sink that low just to find an argument, you've only made the opposition's point for them.
@_date: 2016-11-17 06:09:47
That doesn't make you sound any more rational.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:27:59
No, I mean you have to hold it. You're essentially talking about a currency that nobody wants to spend or can even reasonably spend with the current fees.
It's a broken concept and the only people willing to perpetuate it are the ones who do nothing except hold and hope it increases in value while remaining useless in hopes of finally selling right before it inevitably implodes.
@_date: 2016-12-26 09:07:20
I'm missing the step where you cash out your 401k.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:54:12
I'd disregard any article or segment that calls Bitcoin the new gold. The comparison makes so little sense the opinion of whoever said it becomes instantly worthless.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:07:02
I like how you think those are actual arguments in favour of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-08 12:41:53
Traditional inflation doesn't apply to bitcoin. The increase in supply might be fixed. The purchasing power, which is a far more practical aspect of inflation, is all over the place.

How is it a success when he replaces it with something worse?
@_date: 2016-11-26 07:01:42
But tin foil hat paranoia seems to be an key characteristic of coiners. What else did you expect?
@_date: 2016-12-01 06:44:02
[Here's someone with no credibility saying the same thing.](
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:28:26
See this is what I mean. Bitcoin is amazing... when viewed within it's own little reality.
For instance, it's nice that bitcoin can be 'buried underground with password protection'. The difference is that bitcoin allows you to do that when everything goes right. Gold still allows you to do that when everything goes *wrong*.
You talk about 'massive government crack downs', bitcoin has never seen a massive government crackdown. It's seen some casual attention and some confiscations. If there ever is a serious push against bitcoin it'll be gone just like that.


So again... only when everything goes right and the entire infrastructure is in place? I love how you call something effortlessly and instantaneously when it's really anything but.
I never got why coiners are so delusional about what they're involved in.
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:51:35
And that's fine. That doesn't mean bitcoin is a reasonable replacement for gold though.
@_date: 2016-11-13 10:12:50
Good thing coiners always maintained there can't be any such thing with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:52:37
I wasn't talking about Trump. You've seemed to have lost the trail altogether.
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:44:11
It is. Six times your savings over 26 years with so little risk is the dream.
You're basically playing the lottery with your retirement.

Don't ask bitcoiners about that. They'll tell you the story of how one day each bitcoin will be worth 10k and all that.
Bitcoin's a risk and an experiment. Buy some because it interests you. Not because you expect to make money.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:04:54
Ah yes, generalised answers from decades ago to try and justify a highly specific situation today.
Thanks, that stupid attempt at an argument was missing from the list so far.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:26:03
Not really. Old and new paradigms are irrelevant phrases when it comes to bitcoin.
At the end of the day, Bitcoin is a wildly fluctuating digital currency that fails at being a currency. Sure you can 'make' money speculating on it but you don't have that money unless you sell.
Coiners are just people holding a hat full of casino chips refusing to walk out the door. Which is fine if you plan on walking out that door eventually but until you do, you got nothing but potential that is easily lost.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:02:58
I don't. I just don't consider it a good sign when bitcoin so completely and utterly fails at it's intended purpose.
@_date: 2016-11-27 08:22:48
Eh that's not most tin foil hat. That's a tiny minority exception.
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:30:47
Inheriting so much money that even being a colossal ignorant fuck up can't waste it all does not amount to success.
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:50:47
Bitcoin doesn't threaten government income. If you think you can be a citizen and not owe taxes thats a different story though.
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:41:22
You don't see how incredibly stupid it is to give up your tax breaks and matching bonus for this?
You effectively took your savings from a best case scenario to a worst.
Even if bitcoin booms, achieves mainstream and the government attention that comes with that you fucked yourself.
@_date: 2016-11-02 18:19:18
It's pretty funny. There's a number of examples of people turning to bitcoin en masse and every time it's in the most dire of circumstances when all other options are exhausted.
Bitcoin, for when you absolutely, positively have no alternatives left. Sounds like a slogan.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:07:11
Mainstream has nothing to do with that. Bitcoin is flat out too complicated right now for mainstream appeal. And too risky and unstable for any sensible person to use it as their main form of currency.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:20:44
Pft, the Trump brand stands for ignorance, sexism, exploitation, racism, elitism and a whole host of other negative things.
Most of the people who cheer him seem to be mostly happy to be able to engage in the same horrid behaviour his brand stands for.

This just stopped being funny a while ago. You guys come up with the most bizarre "arguments".
I'm done for today.
@_date: 2016-11-13 13:18:21
Well most people care a little more about stability. Bitcoin fluctuated to the tune of several hundred dollars in value over the course of 2016.
That's not acceptable at all for something you want to use as currency. It's nice that you're willing to accept that but that doesn't change much. It just makes you sound very inept at managing your finances (or wealthy enough to not give a shit).
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:12:16
By what standard? Bitcoin hasn't performed in any way I'd find even remotely acceptable for my currency.
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:23:52
Crime is nothing new to governments.
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:36:38
You had one of the most advantageous financial constructions you could wish for and got out to gamble it one of the most uncertain unstable things out there.
After christmas please do everything you can to try and undo this horrible mistake.
By all means spend every bit of disposable income you have on bitcoin but don't wreck something as financially sound for yourself as your 401k.
@_date: 2016-11-13 10:18:20
That's what you get with a pseudo currency the value of which is mostly determined by public perception.

So dramatic, the war on cash. I haven't wanted paper money in over a decade. I just keep some for necessary situations.
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:55:49
Probably because it's tiresome. This is being flaunted like some kind of big argument in favour of bitcoin.
To people who aren't wearing their tinfoil hat, it doesn't say much good about bitcoin when it takes the economic collapse of a banana republic failing under the mismanagement of a dictator and his cronies before bitcoin starts to look appealing.
@_date: 2016-12-08 05:52:07
I just don't see a reason for them to even bother doing that. For the general public, bitcoin is a story from a few years ago. The total amount of money going around in bitcoin is peanuts to big financial institutions. The amount of traction bitcoin is getting is interesting but nowhere near worrisome. It doesn't have the user friendliness, the backing or the support by anything or anyone that would make the general public trust it enough to mass adopt.
As big business keeps pointing out. The part about bitcoin that's interesting is decentralised ledger technology. Bitcoin itself is just an irrelevant curiosity that's attached to where the real value is.
@_date: 2016-12-08 05:47:35
Bitcoin is the world's first currency backed by tinfoil.

@_date: 2016-11-07 09:42:05

You're starting to sound like a lunatic.
@_date: 2017-08-28 07:31:48
This is the wrong place to ask. Can you afford to lose the money?
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:30:13
That's about the same childish pointless level Trump's at.
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:11:34
Yeah not a fan of any of those either. But they're not at the level of scum where they campaign under the banner "make America great again" while representing everything that's wrong with America.
@_date: 2016-11-13 10:25:49
People don't use it as a currency though. A significant portion of people interested in bitcoin are hoarding it, hoping to make a bundle on the next bubble.
Most businesses that accept bitcoin only do so through a service that converts bitcoin into dollars before it goes into the business' bank account. The service fees being forwarded to the buyer.
Bitcoin fluctuates based on media attention as much as anything.
If bitcoin is supposed to be a currency, it's doing a piss poor job at it. At best it's a convenient method of money transfer where the sender and receiver convert out of bitcoin as fast as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:34:37
I don't know about millions but index funds actually do tend to perform pretty reliably long term.
The thing about index funds is that they're reliable, slow and boring. They don't provide enough return for the greedy. And they need a big enough initial investment that the average person doesn't bother with them.
But if you want to park your money for a few decades, a low to mid risk index fund is a smart choice.

Hodler's are not a saving grace for bitcoin. They're the ones inflating the price into a massive bubble hoping to strike it rich.
They're the ones that are going to pop that bubble eventually and bitcoin will settle on its actual value in the wreckage of everyone who loses out when that happens.

@_date: 2017-11-29 06:55:21
That's a terrible plan. I can't think of a better way to fuck up bitcoin than by inflating it through stupidity and greed, getting it into as many hands as possible, then imploding it as it drops all the way down to it's actual value.
Gotta love the irony of hodlers being the architects of their own failure though.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:40:17
Because large institutions can afford to take a loss in an experiment for accepting bitcoin should the whole thing implode?
Right now the return on investment for bitcoin means it's worth experimenting with. Even if they expect zero future 5 years down the line.

Bitcoin transactions are processed on a distributed network. That means people will need to dedicate computer processing power to actually do the work.
The people who volunteer computer processing power to facilitate this are the miners. The actual processing of these transactions is the act of mining.
Every time a new set of transactions is processed, a small amount of new bitcoin is created and awarded to one of the miners or group of miners working on processing those transactions.
Since there's increasing numbers of bitcoin, users and transactions, it's more and more work to process everything. Which means the workload vs reward is skewing increasingly further towards more work.
In the early days, it was entirely possible to earn quite a bit of bitcoin with your personal computer. Of course at the time bitcoin was almost worthless.
Today it takes a massive amount of processing power to earn a reasonable amount of bitcoin. Profitable miners use entire farms of computers to be profitable.
For the average individual user it makes more sense to simply buy bitcoin with regular money.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:48:03

You're basing that on nothing though. I get that you're desperate to insult me but this isn't it.
I gave you two very simple statements. One is a simple fact from bitcoin's own website. The other is my personal experience. Neither gives you cause for saying the bizarre things you're saying.
Whether or not you give a shit about anything I said is irrelevant. That's not a counter-argument or a basis for what you're trying to say.

There's rather a lot of folks here that actually take pride in not making saner investments and they all seem to feel vindicated by the inflating bubble.
@_date: 2015-08-02 18:13:59
Sounds a bit delusional. For starters most people using bitcoin use exchanges that take a bit off the top as a service fee. That's not bypassing the system, that's pretty much the same thing banks do minus the whole offering interest on your liquid assets. Ie. you're only paying the costs with none of the benefits.
The only reason there isn't legislation affecting bitcoin is because nobody's taken the effort yet. Despite a bit of a fuss a while back bitcoin isn't so much bypassing the system as being simply so insignificant nobody gives a fuck. As soon as it becomes more relevant than that one thing from that criminal case, there will be legislation all over it.
Let's face it. Most of you aren't black market criminals using bitcoin to shift money around the deep web. Most of you are enthusiasts (or fanatics) playing around with bitcoin in a way that is hardly bypassing the system (seriously, what does that even mean?) in any significant way.
The vast majority of people using bitcoin is doing so through services that turn bitcoin into barely more than a paypal style money transfer service with fees on top.

The /s doesn't save you from sounding like an idiot.
Tens of cents on a 10$ transaction is still several percents of the transaction value which is a ridiculously high transaction fee.

Basic financial advice: stabilize your life by mitigating risk factors.
Buying a house instead of mortgaging one (or renting) significantly reduces your day to day costs. Meaning it's a lot easier to live paycheck to paycheck while even saving up a bit. Especially useful for self-employed people.
If you end up in dire straits while mortgaging your house, the bank will take your house. If you end up in dire straits while fully owning your house, you sell off the house and pocket the money. Alternatively, you mortgage the house you already own and keep living there until you sort things out.
Liquidate some of your bitcoin into fiat savings. Savings are boring and the interest rate is embarrassing these days. But savings will save you when you hit a rough spot. Car breaks down, the roof starts leaking, it's nice to have money on hand to fix it immediately before a small problem turns itself into a big problem. 10k savings won't even eat into your bitcoin stack much.
Diversify your assets. You got all your eggs in one basket right now. Sure bitcoin is rising nicely and it's gotten you to this point. The problem with bitcoin is that it's entirely unpredictable. It might be a bubble. There might be a superior competitor around the corner five or ten years from now. Governments might decide to make things difficult enough that bitcoin won't achieve mass appeal.
It doesn't matter really. It's not even a bitcoin thing. If you have 1.8 million dollars in any single asset, you want to diversify. Pick a few safe options with a return on investment that beats inflation and just let compound interest do its thing for the next few decades. *If bitcoin really is going to the moon, half your hoard will still make you ridiculously wealthy* so there's nothing wrong diversifying smartly.
You have enough money to be able to play things smart instead of greedy.
As for your wife. If you want to be purely logical, you sort out a post-nuptial agreement (like a prenup except after the wedding). One way or another this money is going to be a strain. If you tell her about some of it, it'll look doubly suspicious the next time you want to take out and use a chunk of it. If you get divorced, this is part of the assets you're supposed to divvy up and it won't look good you hid it from her.
1.8 million is not "let's quit our jobs" type money. It's not even "lets take a break and travel the world for a year" type money. It's "if we manage this intelligently, the rest of our lives will be more comfortable and a lot more financially secure" type money.

I never once called them benevolent. There is no hard divide between governments and the people. Governments are what happens when people want to get something done beyond simply surviving. Destroy a government and society either ends or creates a new one.
You're a perfect example really. You have a fantasy about not being a citizen because you don't want to pay taxes that are put to use for things you disagree with. If everyone did that, it would be a great way of making sure the greater good is never served.
And you still haven't stopped to think about what life without your citizenship would actually look like. It's pretty hard being a hunter-gatherer these days.

Judging by past performance bitcoin is an incredibly unreliable form of value storage though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:07:15
It's far more rational to expect bitcoin to plummet downwards once the largest speculators decide it's time to sell than to expect this trend to keep going.
Bitcoin isn't going up in value because it's proving it's used. It's going up because greedy people see profit in a high risk, high reward gambit. It blew past 10k because people are literally speculating on bitcoin hoping to get a good return percentage.
Sooner or later it's going to peak, the speculators are going to decide the risk is starting to outweigh the potential profit gain and sell. Bitcoin drops all the way back down to its actual value derived from utility. And that's a fraction of its current worth.
This place is full of self deluding hodlers and new paradigm cultists. It's good for a laugh but it's sad to see people running their finances on irrational fantasies they don't understand themselves.
The irony is that these sad hodlers are getting played by the very people they think they're replacing with their silly new paradigm.

That's because I kept asking you what you thought life without your citizenship actually looks like.

That's why I said decades. The whole point of an index fund is that they're so spread out that they don't tank in the long run. Not unless society itself collapses.
A moderate risk index fund will comfortably beat inflation over your life time. That combined with the power of compound interests makes index funds one of the safest things you can do with your money.

Laugh all you want, compared to bitcoin that is still the smart decision.
We're not talking about someone's little experiment here. This is their income, the money they live from. Most people can't afford to have their income fluctuate by such a massive margin as bitcoin does. Especially if they can avoid it by simply converting it back to traditional currency.
I got some bitcoin, mostly to force myself to keep an eye on developments. I check in on it every now and then. I forgot what I paid for it but it's currently valued at 251 euro. I've seen it at 250, 350, 450, 550 and flop up and down between those numbers.
It's fine, I can laugh it off. It would have been a nightmare if that was my paycheck or my savings. Especially since none of my bills are expressed in bitcoin. My mortgage is not 4 bitcoins. If I could pay my mortgate with bitcoin I wouldn't be paying 4 bitcoin a month. It be paying my set mortgage in euro's converted to whatever value bitcoin has at that given moment.
In the end, it doesn't matter how you feel about bitcoin. The smart decision, no the only sensible decision is to keep your cash flow in traditional currency. Bitcoin's current state makes it great for transfers where you convert money to bitcoin, transfer and immediately convert back to money again before it can change value much.
As a means of keeping your money long term it's completely unreliable.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:43:39

Do you realise how silly you make yourself sound?
Prices of everything you buy and every cost you make are set in conventional currency. Even if you can pay for something in Bitcoin, the cost is still set in conventional currency. 
Leaving your earnings in Bitcoin just leaves you open to the wild value fluctuations for no real advantage at all. For your own financial security it's sensible to just convert the Bitcoin back into conventional currency.
Most of the arguments in favour of keeping it in Bitcoin revolve around enthusiasm for the platform or tinfoil hat reasoning (by the way you phrase things you sound like the latter).

@_date: 2017-11-29 14:47:32
Actually, it means exactly that. Bitcoin's rising value right now is not tied to increasing *use* of bitcoin as a currency. It's tied to increasing numbers of people and even investment groups buying into the hype hoping to profit from the cycle.
Sooner or later that's going to reach it's apex, when people realise it stops rising, they'll start selling. And the selling will continue until there's a new equilibrium is reached. And that new equilibrium will be based on what people are willing to pay for bitcoin simply for the functionality it provides instead of the hope it'll keep inflating based on media hype.
That stabilized value determined by function will be a mere fraction of the value determined by hype and hot air. It's the very definition of a bubble. 
I'd be saying the exact opposite if bitcoin's meteoric rise was based on increasing number of people *using* bitcoin. But it's not. You don't see your fellow citizens starting to buy and pay with bitcoin left and right.
Mostly what you're seeing is parasitic hodlers inflating the price and telling themselves they're going to be the ones that cash out in time. They're the ones that are going to get dragged out when the whales decide it's time to cash out.

You're still missing the point but it's getting tedious to try and make you see logic.
Bubbles happen when people disastrously misjudge the state of things. That's never a good thing for anyone except the few who see it coming and take advantage of it instead of fixing it. It certainly isn't good for whatever industry it happens in as it implodes afterwards. And it certainly isn't good for users relying on whatever is bubbling.
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:30:27
That's a nice tinfoil hat statement but corruption doesn't need banks or governments. It's governments and banks that are getting the Greek people out of this as well.
Besides part of the problem is that the Greek simply don't want to accept that they're in a tough spot and certainly don't want to carry that burden. Which is why they keep demanding that other countries step in and solve it for them.
For instance the retirement age in Greece is commonly somewhere between 45 and 50. The retirement age in my country is 67 and rising. Greece demands several billion euros worth of aid from my country to avoid having to take measures like increasing their retirement age.

You don't seem to understand though. Those ads can be paid for in bitcoin but are priced in dollars or euro's. Incidentally this is so because companies have figured out that while they don't want to *have* any bitcoin, it's easy enough to allow people to pay for products with an auto conversion service and pass the cost of the service on to the customer.
Keeping your money in bitcoin until it's time to pay for the next series of advertisements means the cost of the ad hasn't changed but your capacity to pay for them likely has.
It's ridiculous how rabid bitcoin advocacy has gotten on this reddit. People don't even seem to understand what they preach. It's just rabble rabble bitcoin.

Bitcoin has a value (not sure what you mean by *true* value, it’s a meaningless addition). It’s value is the fiat amount or amount of trade people are willing to pay to obtain bitcoin. This entire sub is cheering every time bitcoin’s fiat value reaches a new high.
Bitcoin’s current value keeps rising because people keep buying hoping that trend well persist, allowing them to eventually sell for a profit.
That creates a bubble. Currently it’s value is not based on utility. It’s based on people’s desire and hope they’ll sell at a higher value than they’re currently buying. Eventually people will sell out. Sellers will be more eager than buyers because faith in further bubbling is gone.
That’s when bitcoin’s value plummets back down to a value based on simple utility and nothing more.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:47:04

That's not what I said so I'm guessing you're trying to be disingenuous rather than construct a decent argument.
There's nothing stopping conventional financial services from creating, free, instantaneous banking services when the need arises. In fact, they are already doing so where convenient, for instance within the EU. 
Sure American banking is kind of shitty but should the need arise they can manage as well. For instance, if bitcoin ever get's it's shit together and poses serious competition (as if that'll ever happen) they can easily offer the same functionality.
So these tedious posts pretending bitcoin is actually safer or better than existing systems by using sob stories instead of actual arguments are kind of tedious and disingenious.

Edit: for the people down voting. If you're into bitcoin for the sake of money rather than an interest in technology.

@_date: 2017-04-17 07:43:37
I don't see how that matters really. If it was a requirement in order to stay competitive it would be the bank's idea. 
It doesn't matter why these things happen only that they do and can. 
Coiners keep trying to set up a false narrative where bitcoin has unique qualities that other systems are incapable achieving. The sad fact is that coiners are trying to promote bitcoin based on storytelling rather than fact. When people have to resort to that sort of thing, it really means they got nothing going for them.
@_date: 2017-04-18 05:42:52

Not at all. The Greeks want money. A colossal amount of money to try and fix their screw ups. The EU is finally setting terms instead of dumping it down a black hole.
The only reason it's even on the table is because it's bad for both sides if Greece continues to fuck things up like this.

Oh please, it went down to what, 5k? When the bubble pops you'll wish it just sank to 5k.
This was just bitcoin's inherent volatility and uselessness as a currency at play.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:18:39
You don't need hints for that. Pretty much all crypto coins currently have a value based on media attention and market manipulation, not utility.
Positive press? Value bubbles up. Negative press or even measures taken against it? Value crashes into a pit of despair.
None of it ever has anything to do with it's actual utility.
@_date: 2016-09-30 12:14:54
You still seem to be in the mindset that bitcoin is threatening anything or holds some kind of key to the future. There's no arguing with that kind of silliness.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:34:28
And I call bullshit. If bitcoin's value was connected to it's utility instead of media perception it wouldn't fluctuate in value by 75% in the space of a few weeks.

My guess is that the actual cost of their product is so low, they can take a risk on unverified payments.
If it doesn't go through, you lost a few cents in materials and time. If some moron actually does pay with bitcoin, there's a good chance it'll fluctuate past the sales price of your product at some point anyway.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:13:57


That sounds like the opposite of bitcoin to me. Transaction fees are high and transactions are slow. For a 25$ transaction I'm paying about 20-25% in fees if I want an acceptable transaction speed.
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:07:36
Ever noticed how most investments and other finance schemes have to point out that results from the past offer no guarantee for the future?
Bitcoin's past means very little for bitcoin's future. Especially since the bigger it gets, the more likely it is that various parties are going to respond to it.
I absolutely believe cryptocurrency has the future. But usually, the pioneers are the ones that bubble up and die so that others may learn and do it right on the first try.
Bitcoin is a great bet for riding the wave and getting out before the inevitable collapse. The future belongs to whoever gets it right, not whoever was first. And bitcoin most definitely didn't get it right.

You just pointed out that bitcoin gives you a choice between ludicrously high transfer fees or ludicrously slow transfers. That's an interesting topic if you want to compare that to conventional banking services.
But all you're doing is getting pissy about it.

@_date: 2017-09-23 07:43:34
I don't really care either way. Someone asked how they accept payments and I answered.
Either a payment service that passes the fee on to the customer or they're simply doing unverified transactions.

That's just not comparable. Currencies like the euro and the dollar have a very, very long list of predictors on how they're doing and a very strong resistance to failure due to how they're backed.
Bitcoin is backed by... media attention. It crashes and peaks depending on whose whining or lauding it. It's got no serious foundation, no predictable future. It's literally a hot air balloon running on hype and the fact that it hasn't yet become important enough for authorities to act against in any serious way.

It really wasn’t. The government has to auction all criminal assets at the conclusion of the trial. They would have done the same thing if the object in question was a rusty pickup truck with a bed loaded with jars full of toenail clippings.
It doesn’t mean the government sees jars full of toenail clippings as something of value. It just means there’s rules in place that mandate they sell seized assets at the conclusion of a trial.
On the other hand, it is true that coiners tend to act on things imagined as much as things that are real. So the auction probably did have an effect simply because of all the coiners like you who base their financial dealings on events they don’t understand.

There are so many different banks in the Netherlands that pretty much every bill I pay and every transfer I make goes to a different bank.
Most of my big transfers go from me to either private individuals or the businesses I make big purchases at like the car and kitchen vendor, some contractors etc. Back when I was still a freelancer I had relatively large sums incoming that I then transferred from a checking account into a savings account until it was time to pay my taxes.

Mindless advice. To some people 1k is a lot at any age. Bitcoin is a huge risk factor to treasure hunters hoping to strike rich with money they can't afford to lose.

@_date: 2017-10-24 18:50:13
I'm still missing the relevance. Bitcoin is not an automatic free market fantasy.
Mythical Satoshi and his dragon's hoard of bitcoin alone could influence the value quite nicely if he wanted to. Controlling the majority of mining power would influence the value quite nicely.
The fact that you're going to lose increasing numbers of bitcoin from a finite total of bitcoin is going to influence things.

Lol all you want. Bitcoin doesn't have the money or the manpower to properly install it as a universal currency nor the trust of it's people to have it adopted.
There's a reason bitcoin has a reputation for being for techies, tinfoil hats and criminals.
The fact that no government has installed a digital currency to replace current ones is simply down to the fact that it's a basic fact that governments, nor economies, nor populations are ready to make the switch.
Bitcoin is mostly interesting as a tech experiment not a serious threat or contender for a real currency. Even most bitcoin users don't treat it as a currency.

Bitcoin transactions are not processed instantaneously. Watching someone send one on their phone is pretty meaningless from a security point of view.
Exchanges won't even accept your bitcoin transaction until it's about 6 blocks into the chain. At that point, there are 6 confirmations of the transaction and the risk of a malicious double spend is negligible. 
Likely there's nobody who's going to attempt a malicious double spend on a snack purchase but the seller is still taking the payment in good faith. Which is easy to accept for a low cost sale like a snack.
It's just as likely that they're simply using a payment processor that accepts bitcoins and converts it to dollars before the money reaches the business. At that point, it's entirely risk-free.
Customer pays with bitcoin. Vendor employs a service that accepts the bitcoin, converts it dollars, passes their service fee onto the buyer and passes the dollar amount the vendor charges for his product on to the vendor.
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:20:58

I do understand the intention. It just makes me laugh when people think that's going to win out.
Real life is not a cheesy cyberpunk movie. People love the idea of decentralisation and deregulation until their livelihood is at risk. Mt. Gox was a cluster fuck. Exchanges are cluster fucks waiting to happen. Bitcoin’s association with crime and black markets is a huge mark against it.
At the end of the day, main stream means customer service. It means stable backing. It means being able to hold people responsible. And it’s going to take a to more than a bit of dissatisfaction with the divide between rich and poor and the relative lack of accountability for large corporations to make people go all in on naive dreams about anarchist utopias.
The status quo might make people whine but it’s also keeping them fat, save and entertained. At the end of the day that’s all people want. Bitcoin is going nowhere because it has nowhere to go.
Right now it’s just floating on delusion, tinfoil hats and users actually interested in dodging oversight.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:10:02
Let me rephrase that, he doesn't even seem to have an argument. He rambles a bit about finite amounts in a very meaningless way.
The only way you can keep mining gold is if you ignore the laws of physics. Gold isn't just rare on earth, it's rare in the universe. It takes some pretty unusual circumstances to produce gold atoms.
The fact that bitcoin is finite is not necessarily a good thing. The fact that fiat can be printed is not necessarily a bad thing. For a currency, it's a rather nice quality that it can be managed if done well and when necessary. For a currency, it's not so great if the total is immutable, even when units get lost.
Along the same lines, the immutability of math is utterly irrelevant considering you don't have to change the math, just the way the math is applied. For instance when developers develop, or fork to develop in different directions.
I like and respect Woz but there's nothing in those ramblings that even resembles a worthwhile argument.

Honestly I don’t care if this CEO is right or wrong. I don’t care if he does or doesn’t have the qualifications for making those statements.
What I care about is this community’s tendency to wander away from reality by crafting it’s own demented narratives to make these utterly baseless and empty counter arguments to anything it doesn’t like.
The sad irony is that coiners love to cry about corporations, CEO’s, governments and so on building a narrative instead of following truth and fact. I’ve never seen anyone so adept at creating baseless narratives as coiners.

You don't seem very open to learning either considering it's either your way or the wrong way. There's lots of reasons why you'd want a limited blockchain. Most blockchain research is not trying to replicate bitcoin.

Bitcoin is an interesting experiment but outside of criminals, paranoids and anarchists it doesn't really suit anybody's actual needs. Hell, even the people directly involved with bitcoin are having schisms over their differences of opinion.
Many of the most promising research projects revolving around blockchain employ a controlled exchange in order to try and get the most of the upside while curbing the worst of the downsides.

Oh look, more irrelevancies. In a free market the price of goods and services are determined by consumers without influence by governments, monopolies or other authorities.
There's absolutely nothing about bitcoin that ensures a free market. There's nothing stopping any organization or authority from controlling a significant portion of either the bitcoin supply or the mining power or both.

OP cherry picked a bunch of quotes with the aim of discrediting the bank CEO you’re referring to by placing him in the company of people who turned out to be wrong about the future in the past.
The fact is that none of those people and none of their statements about the future have any relation or bearing on this particular CEO and his statement or his qualifications for making such a statement.
This is the type of disingenuous self delusion that this subreddit is rife with. Which wouldn’t be so bad if this was, say, a subreddit about video games. But it’s not, people are dealing with money here, a lot of people come here for advice about handling their money.

You're just saying random things that don't mean anything.
The blockchain belongs to whoever feels like investing in majority mining power.

@_date: 2017-10-05 14:42:02
The problem is that it's no way predictable, reliable or rationally explainable.
Bitcoin's growth has proven that it can be worth dipping into if you can get out in time. It hasn't done a single thing to create any kind of faith that it's going to stick around for the long run or why people should want it to.
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:51:45
So you’re trying to say they should have just told a bald faced lie? 
From the government’s point of view, this was the easiest way to deal with it. It’s not illicit so destroying it under that pretence would have been a bald faced lie. Destroying it under another pretence would have forced the government to take some kind of stance on bitcoin.
Simply accepting that the stuff has value, can be sold and selling it off at auction was the easiest solution. It means the government passes no judgement on the stuff one way or the other. It just goes up for auction to whoever wants it for whatever price it’ll fetch and the government is rid of it.
Auctioning it off was the course of action that had the lowest chance of coming back to haunt them. No lies were told. No statements were made. No stance was taken.
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:17:22
Drugs and explosives aren't auctioned off for the same reason the police don't offer assassination services.
As for the lying. There's a pretty big difference between dodging a lie that was already told and making a big public example of taking a stance on bitcoin for the world to see.
As I pointed out, out of all the options available, this was the most low impact option they could take.

I'm Dutch, we pay a flat annual fee for our banking. I don't pay any additional fees on top of that for anything save for interest if I'm overdrawn. No fine for being overdrawn though.
My banking costs a 1,45 euro a month and that's it, I have no other fees. And I've been shuttling large sums of money around for quite a bit since I bought a house three years ago. There have been renovations to the house, a car, a new kitchen so there have been some sizeable sums moving between my savings account, checking account and third parties that I've paid.
The only fee I've ever paid during that entire process was when I closed my mortgage. But that wasn't a money transfer fee, that was the payment for my external mortgage advisor. It's common to include that in the mortgage amount I close on and it's tax deductable anyway.
If a bank has to nickle and dime their individual customers with fees to make a profit, they're awful at being a bank.

If you're going to talk about general investment rules, you should probably also mention that investing is generally ill advised until after you've build significant liquid savings. After you've participated in any stable long term financial plans you're eligible for. And only if you diversify your investments.

It's almost the polar opposite of gold.
Gold does not corrode or physically degrade. If you're holding a gold coin, you'll still be holding a gold coin when the world is burning. You lose your access to bitcoin as soon as you lose your internet connection.
The laws of physics place a limitation on how much gold is around in the universe. Bitcoin might be limited by its business rules but that doesn't mean much if it keeps forking or when someone else comes up with a better alternative with more mainstream appeal.
Gold is a stable store of value because it's inverse relationship to the economy. If the economy is booming, you get much more return on investments in the economy and the gold price predictable flattens out or sinks a little. If the economy is volatile, that same stability is attractive and gold prices predictably rise a bit.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, can fluctuate in massive percentages based on nothing more than negative or positive media attention. It's the opposite of a good hedge against turmoil because it's value twitches like a paranoid delusional's self esteem.
Ultimately that means that gold is a good hedge alongside other investments. It won't make you much money in the long run but it won't lose you much money either.
Bitcoin is barely an investment. It's more of a big gamble. If you ride the wave you can earn a lot of money and if you're unlucky, the whole thing will burn down around you.

Doing something about it doesn't necessarily mean trying to arrest people or shut down servers. Doing something about it could be creating a state backed crypto currency that easily ties into the existing banking system with proper customer service and accountability.
Ie. provide a smooth transition into the next state of currency just like much of the West once made a smooth transition from physical money first to plastic bank cards first.
Doing something about it could mean spending effort to track and find Bitcoin holders before taxing and fining them for unreported wealth. My nation holds a big effort every few years to track down people's unreported savings and it's quite effective. Numerous people hand themselves over just to get a lower fine for tax dodging all those years.
All you need to 'do something about bitcoin' is provide a more acceptable alternative and bitcoin's mainstream reason for being disappears.
Blockchain is not the ultimate customer service. Block chain does not pick up the phone and answer questions or provide assistance. Blockchain is the technology many institutions are looking into adapting for their own use while ignoring bitcoin. Hell, I have a meeting about looking into the potential of block chain tech for our organisation next week.
Anyway my original point was that I see a big future for mass acceptance of crypto. I just don't see bitcoin being that mass accepted cryptocurrency. It's lacking almost all of the key qualities. It's just showing the world what can be instead of being it.

I fail to see your point really. There's more than one way to achieve mining. Sometimes the lack of trust only goes one way and you don't need anonymous miners.
For instance, one application that pops up a lot is dealing with licences, certifications and other documents where the issuing party is trusted but forgery is a real issue. In this case, transactions would be stored in a blockchain but the actual mining would be performed only by trusted partners. Often a number a paid, unrelated partners that provide mining servers in exchange for direct payment.
Another example has a managed exchange between service users and service providers. Users buy and with pay tokens that get destroyed. Providers mine tokens that can be sold to users through an exchange with a set token price. There's no direct contact between users and providers, providing a measure of privacy.

Oh, I can. I'm also readily willing to admit that the number of situations where that is actually a workable solution is much smaller than blockchain proponents like to pretend.
Blockchain *might* be a good solution if you're dealing with a situation where you have a **transaction database** for **multiple writers** who **do not trust each other** and **no trusted intermediary** and **interdependent transaction** and **validation rules.**
If not *all* of those conditions are met, blockchain solutions are usually ridiculously overcomplex for the challenge you're trying to solve. And the number of situations where all of those criteria are met is pretty damn small.

Maybe it's just because I'm not willing to take a step back from my regular banking but it's literally never acceptable for me to do less than instantaneous.
Even when I transfer money between two accounts that I own, I won't tolerate delays. There's literally no reason to have delays these days.
If I send money to anyone, I want them to be able to verify the very moment I hit the button. I bought my first car from a private individual the other day with regular banking. They wouldn't have let me drive off with the car if they couldn't confirm on the spot that they received my payment.
If my banking hadn't been instantaneous, I would have had to pay in cash.

Just like any other kind of trading that's not fiat. Or fiat for that matter. Plenty of shady cash trades going around.


For now. The bigger bitcoin get's, the most interesting it becomes to make a major effort at cracking or derailing it. There are zero guarantees it's future proof.


No, it doesn't. One of the primary qualities of a store of value is that is has a predictable value once you retrieve it. Bitcoin does not. Over the last few weeks bitcoin fluctuated by some 25+%. That's not predictable at all.

That's a fairytale really. It doesn't distribute trust, it puts trust into whoever controls the mining. Right now the vast majority of all mining is done in China, that doesn't sound very distributed to me.
And trust in what really? A bunch of developers who can't even decide what bitcoin should be and just create branches when they can't reach an agreement?

Bitcoin is a pioneer. The road to progress is paved with the corpses of pioneers.
Because everyone who follows a pioneer can avoid their mistakes, avoid the costs they incurred in their mistakes and spend their time and money improving on their predecessors.
Bitcoin has a lot of room for improvement. And the bigger it gets, the more interesting it becomes for someone to build a better cryptocurrency with more focus on easy integration and acceptance in all the ways that matter.
Creating a userbase is a lot harder than telling a userbase "we're like A but better in every way".
As far as I'm concerned, bitcoin might be the spark the starts things but eventually, it'll just be that forgotten pioneer. That rough prototype people can't even imagine using. More importantly, I think bitcoin is going to be that forgotten pioneer long before realising the potential people imagine it has.

Here's the funny part though. A liar spreads falsehood with *the intent to deceive.* I didn't spread falsehoods, I expressed an opinion.

Since most merchants aren't crazy enough to actually hold bitcoin, they usually employ services that convert the transaction into traditional currency while passing the fee on to the buyer. On top of his bitcoin fee.
Bitcoin fluctuates for lots of reasons, not the least media headlines. Don't pretend it's reliable economic principle at work.
Sorry you're having such a hard time following. It's not that difficult.

At that point it becomes speculation which would be a really, really bad property for something trying to be a currency.
As long as you can feasibly speculate on bitcoin, especially short term as is the case, it'll be terrible and useless form of currency.

I wasn't saying anything about you but if you consider bitcoin an investment rather than a currency, bitcoin is failing.

You have a measuring unit for... realness?
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:21:17
That's not what I'm saying though. I'm sure crypto and blockchain is the future. I just don't see any reason to expect bitcoin to be that future.
Along the same lines, I don't care what bitcoin intends to be. I just care about what it is right now and that's not what it wants to be.

I've gotten in and out of bitcoin so many times over the years. Including when it was so worthless I just deleted it or threw it away when switching computers.
Most of the time I just got some when I checked back in out of curiosity. I still don't have a high opinion of bitcoin. It just doesn't seem to be doing it's intended job.
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:14:45
You honestly need me to explain currency to you? You might want to refrain from commenting altogether.
Try a high school economics book.

Hah thanks. I only have my dime as a motivation to keep an eye on bitcoin development. I know I sound pretty glum but I do have a lot of interest in the concept.
My dime keeps me invested. =)

The only entities I trust less than corporations are users. At least corporations are predictable.

I wonder if they understand how much the value of bitcoin fluctuates? I only have a bit dime and it's a constant source of amusement seeing how much it goes up and down in value.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:55:37
Well to keep it simple, bitcoin.org describes bitcoin as 'a payment network and a new kind of money'. Bitcoin fails at both.
As a payment network it's slow and most of the promised advantages aren't really in place. It's slow and you end up paying fees for each transaction. Rather high ones at the moment.
As a new kind of money, it fluctuates harshly, sometimes by hundreds of dollars in the space of days or weeks. Absolutely useless as money.
In the end, bitcoin ends up as a commodity that people hoard, hoping to make money off the next bubble.
Pretty much the only people getting any real use out of bitcoin are the ones converting traditional currency into coin, making the transaction and converting coin back into real money on the other end immediately before they can lose money on fluctuations. Everyone else is just gambling.

The problem is that there's plenty of drugs that you don't want to have freely available at a low price.
People can't even moderate their sugar and transfat consumption. Do you really want a nation with soaring poverty and unemployment rates as well as wide spread problems in the quality of education to have easy access to cheap harddrugs?
Even if you're callous enough to not care about what people do to themselves, it's the rest of society that pays for the aftermath.
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:56:42
I'm saying people can't handle even slightly harmful substances. I don't see where folks get the idea that making harddrugs freely available would somehow lead to a better situation.

Not really, I didn't advocate selling or holding. I sound like a rational person who isn't trying to turn this into a dimwitted sold vs hold battle. 
I mean really, all that does is make you sound like someone who doesn't have a clue as to whats going on, so they simplified the whole thing into something binary.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:27:21
That... seems entirely meaningless.
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:53:13
And that's why bitcoin hasn't gone mainstream. Volatility.
At the moment it's simply stupid for the average consumer to hold on to bitcoins because there's no telling what they might be worth by the time you use them.

At the end of the day, that guy didn't stop anything.
@_date: 2016-07-24 15:18:57
Bullshit. It's because in most western countries it's either common courtesy or law to keep people's full names out of the press until after they've been convicted or the investigation is closed.
This is nothing new and the main reason we do this is because using someone's full name before all the facts are known *would* actually be shaping the narrative.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:55:15
You mean the service eats a loss if bitcoin drops in value between sending and receiving? Ie. 100$ in is 100$ out?

That makes no sense.

It seems to fluctuate by at least 10-20% over a period of weeks. That's completely unacceptable for anything but a fun experiment. It's certainly unacceptable for a migrants paycheck.
I hope those people cash in their bitcoins at the earliest opportunity after sending.

What if he's forced into it because they're threatening his family, it's not unheard of. What if he's not a muslim. What if he is in fact mentally ill with no ties to ISIS. What if he's simply American and it's a cultural thing?
The original complaint was that they're spinning the narrative. Just plunking in an obviously Arab name without any of the facts about the situation *is* simply irresponsible and spinning the narrative.
The man might not get convicted but it might be nice to actually have some facts instead of just dropping a name and waggling your eyebrows in a suggestive manner.
@_date: 2016-07-20 17:21:54
And let's be fair. This is a jab at the instability of the pound not an endorsement of the stability of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-27 06:48:17
The project is in jeopardy already because coiners are encouraging each other to hoard it like a commodity instead of spending it like a currency as intended.
Sooner or later it's going to hit the wall where people realise that bitcoin is worthless if it just gets hoarded instead of used. With the result that the massive sell off will plummet the value.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:19:33
The majority of people treat bitcoin as a commodity to be hoarded.
It's very difficult to see it as a currency really.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:55:47
Who in the right mind would purchase anything that big with a unit that fluctuates so wildly in value though?
The difference between being able to afford a house or not could be last week's media headlines.

I wonder if that makes you accessory to any crimes committed in the name of getting that reward.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:41:17
You’re essentially admitting that bitcoin by itself doesn’t work without layering on all the services that mimics banks, payment processors and the like. At that point it’s only a small step to admitting that you really need a lot more oversight and centralised responsibility when dealing with people’s livelihoods. 
Bitcoin as intended does’t really work for the vast majority of people. Bitcoin with services layered on is just a less supervised, less safe way of storing your money.
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:40:39
Yeah but you have virtually no decent legal case.
@_date: 2016-07-24 15:12:58
Unlike America in most of the west "innocent until proven guilty" actually means something and people's full names normally aren't used in the news until they're convicted or the investigation is closed.
One common method to avoid being completely impersonal in the press is to use the first name (if sufficiently neutral) and the first letter of the last name or simply mr. First letter last name if their first name is rather telling.
That's the opposite of shaping the narrative. And things have always been done that way, not just recently.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:50:04
You might want to work on your communication skills then because you're making little sense.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:18:38
It's a dramatic way of phrasing it but while I think cryptocurrency is the future, I doubt bitcoin is going to be the one.
The masses want something easy to use with a centralised organisation that can be contacted and held responsible. Both governments and industry want something that can be tracked and controlled.
The most interesting part about bitcoin is decentralised ledger technology really, that's the part that's going to survive. Bitcoin itself is just a pioneer and the road to progress is made from the corpses of pioneers.
When the time is right, some form of cryptocurrency is going to be created that meets all the criteria set by both the public and gov/corp. They won't have to stop bitcoin, it'll be just as fringe as it is today.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:47:10
You seem to think you're making a point...
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:02:44
At least gold can make the claim that it is a physical limited resource that doesn't degrade.
Bitcoin hoarding is mostly based on hoping for the next publicity fueled bubble.
@_date: 2017-06-27 07:28:11
The point is that people cheer every time there's a headline that says "business X accepts bitcoin!".
While the truth is that business X doesn't accept bitcoin. Business X doesn't want bitcoin. Business X doesn't give a shit about bitcoin.
They're just making you pay for a service that'll take your bitcoin and converts it into traditional currency. It just doesn't mean anything at all for mainstream bitcoin acceptance, it's nothing to cheer about.
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:45:28
If it is, it's a disaster of a currency. Money this volatile is useless.
@_date: 2016-07-24 19:32:51
It's not censorship when you omit something yourself. And all things considering it would be nice to not preemptively stoke the fire before having the facts.

@_date: 2017-06-27 06:51:58
As always I'd like to point out that more likely than not, Poland's largest food delivery does not accept bitcoin.
They likely engaged a service that converts bitcoin into traditional currency before the transaction even reaches their business. The fee for which is passed on to the buyer.
All this means is yet another business that foots the bill for dealing with coiners to said coiners. In other words, here's you paying the transaction fees bitcoin was so proud not to have.
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:45:41

Take off your tinfoil hat for a moment. Governments are responsible for law enforcement and public safety. That means in rapidly changing times, things are going to change.

It's pretty common for a nation's national bank to have considerable, almost authorative influence on economic legislation regarding currency and means of payment.
