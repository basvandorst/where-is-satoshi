Check this article (2011):
Read the comments and notice the pessimism and arrogance. They believe they are "experts" and predict things like if everything was so easy. 
Since bitcoin was 1 USD people is saying things like "it's a bubble", "it's impossible it will reach 1k", etc..
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:03:45
No, they can't because dapps are like Bitcoin, it's a peer to peer system.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:57:57
But Bitcoin (I won't include every crypto since all of them have special features) isn't treated mainly as a currency. Actually, since the hype began, people have been comparing it with gold and it's seen as an investment. The social image around that concept is already built and is very strong. 
Just consider people from Venezuela; they have a very big inflation problem and people from that country is buying Bitcoin to be safe from it. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:24:27
Can you explain with this logic the price of gold then? What would be the difference? Depending in the usage of Bitcoin, it might be really affected by events like wars and recessions. For example, the price of gold increased by 3x from 2008 to 2012. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:23:21
Your analysis is an oversimplification of the value of Bitcoin. 
Many people don't see Bitcoin as a currency to pay for goods, instead they see BTC to safeguard their money from the international economy. In this sense, BTC's value doesn't come from how useful it's to pay for stuff, it comes from how good it's to protect your money.
But, the value of Bitcoin doesn't extend to that sphere only. Think about how much miners are paying to produce 1 Bitcoin and then ask yourself if there isn't a relation between this value and some of the "intrinsic value" of BTC (in other words, I'm pretty confident that while the price is moving to the cost of producing 1 Bitcoin, the change rate decreases and it's probably very hard for the price to go below it). 
The other value (that's related to the previous one) comes from the fact that Bitcoin is a very secure network that's very hard to "hack", since there is a lot of miners with very huge investments in hardware and infrastructure and thus you would need a very very big investment to attack the network successfully at which point it doesn't even make too much sense to "destroy" it. 
You can't say the same about a lot of other altcoins that are mined, since their mining network is very weak. 
The final values I consider come from the technology and potential, and many people are speculating about it, but with rational reasons; it might be overvalued in this sense, but even if it was and the price faces a correction for this, I'm fairly confident the appreciation of the value of this technology will increase with the time just as the dot com bubble exploded, and then it just recovered with time.

A rough idea could be to make a dapp to create a decentralized autonomous reputation system. And to force people to choose the correct individual to host the node, you could force them to make a rational decision if they vote with their money. 
I would need to think about the details of such a system and the feasibility (I'm not an expert at financial instruments nor CS though), but I believe it could be made.
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:01:15
This argument is flawed, since If money is a problem, there could be created a non-profit organization to establish nodes across the world with the help of donations. And the incentive to do it, would be to secure the network and thus secure your investment and future.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:35:26
It's fun because I get the same safety feeling from Bitcoin. It's like a really good way to protect your money now.
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:28:09
Who says so? The donated money could be distributed using smart contracts to individuals the community (aka consensus) choose to support.

 You are contradicting yourself, lol.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:11:18
The bitcoin network is somewhat special (despite being a bit centralized). It has thousands and thousands of machines specialized to "mine" bitcoins, this makes it a very secure network for payments, or in general, making transactions. 
You could make your own private chain, but it will never be as secured as bitcoin's blockchain since it would require a very small investment to launch a 51% attack on it (If you have 51% of the mining power of the network, you can double spend your bitcoins and do other nasty things). 
So, basically all the money invested in mining hardware from miners (millions and millions of USD) makes it a secure network and thus adding intrinsic value to it. This is one of the things that increase the value of bitcoins. But there are others; bitcoin has a robust network as a payment system, the technology behind BTC will be upgraded with an update that's very promising (Segwit, Lightning networks), the social image behind BTC since lot of people is talking about it as digital gold, the dissociation of traditional financial markets, among other things. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:33:54
No dude, a dapp is a smart contract run in a blockchain. You should study your stuff before arguing.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:10:46
You didn't hold them enough though. In the end, you ended up selling them in the dip, which is basically sell low and buy high. Bitcoin eventually is going to dip, and that's not a matter of if it will happen, it's a matter of when it will happen. But, of course it's going to recover and then climb much more. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:58:39
It might be not that easy. We will surely see moments in which everyone will want to sell their coins, and you might fall for your weakness. It has happened a lot of times before, and it will continue to happen.

Haven't you think that BTC is already centralized enough that what you are thinking is basically a mirror of Core ideals? 
What's the difference between the support of miners and exchange from the support of Core?
Why do you trust Core in a trustless system?
In my honest opinion, Bitcoin seems like a failed experiment at this stage, because as you have proven consesus is nothing else besides a product of an alienated community. There is an entity leading, and people is following and trusting that entity, then other people come and adhere to the group thinking.  I think the original creator of Bitcoin left the project for that reason; he didn't want to become a symbol to follow and trust, and therefore a point of failure. 
I know I will get downvoted, but I don't mind it. People used to disagree with me when I got into Bitcoin at 2012; the world rejected and laughed at us, and that's probably good. 
EDIT: If you are going to downvote me though, convince me I'm wrong, because I really want to be convinced that I'm wrong and tell myself everything is right.

@_date: 2017-09-26 20:28:43
What kind of justification do you want to see? 
A big portion of the community right now doesn't understand Bitcoin and it's fundamentals, they need a guide to tell them what's good and what's bad, and there is where Core is playing an important role. 
Look, I'm not saying Core is evil, that it wants to control the project with selfish intentions, etc... What I'm saying, is that we all have a notion of what's good for the society and we all want it to succeed, the problem is when we try to implant that notion in the mind of the people believing that's what they need, just as Hitler probably did. 
I see you didn't refute any of my accusations in any way, and instead of that you decided to attack me personally based in my activity which, honestly, is really sad. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 06:29:33
If that were to happen, there are bigger things to worry instead of BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:43:46
This seems more like a "new-user take over".
I do say, 80+% of the community right now, are new users that got in after they saw the price increase and wanted to become rich. 
What about the people that has been supporting BTC since it's creation? 
Coinbase for example has been around since the very beginning providing services. Miners have huge stakes of money invested supporting the transactions and making the network work. Do you really believe they want to damage their own heritage and what they have been supporting for years?
What have you done for the community apart from buying some BTC? How much money did you put in BTC? For how long have you been here? Are you the good guy in this movie?
@_date: 2017-09-24 04:48:03
Yeah, that could work for smaller transactions, but for bigger ones you would need a bank transfer and the procedence of the funds will be checked. 
I mean, governments can't completely stop BTC it's impossible, but they can still do a lot of harm until banks are finally replaced by distributed trustless tech.
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:01:35
I know, but you need to learn WAY more than that. I suggest you to start with the fundamentals of BTC, instead of asking things related to how much you could make.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:02:49
The proportion of Long/Shorts is a good measure of how obvious is the next movement. 
Lot of people was still in denial, I did a market research about it; I do say 90% of people denied China ban of exchanges. Some people will wait until last moment (official announcement) to sell, so except a crash when that happens. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:14:02
It's still a takeover in which Core is providing trust to non-tech-savvy people in a supposed to be trustless system. Also, a big portion of the media is manipuled to protect Bitcoin from divisions, and this shouldn't be done in my opinion. 
What the people with relatively more power is doing, is not better than what Hitler and other dictators did; dictate what's good and what's bad and convince the people about it.

I will cite Gregory Maxwell:
"I am a Bitcoin user and investor, long before and to a much greater extent than almost everyone here. Please don't tell me that I am not allowed to have an opinion about someone trying to rewrite Bitcoin's rules in an incompatible way which I believe would destroy its value."
Full context: 
To believe Core or people in charge of the media doesn't care about the value of Bitcoin is, sincerely, naive. 
I believe both parties want the good for Bitcoin, because both parties profit from it and one besides that care also about the tech for the tech. It would be stupid to think one party want to destroy BTC, or believe it's an attack, from a maximizing-value-of-BTC-point-of-view. It's just that they have different perspectives, and the perspective that's is winning is the one that has more trust in the community, not because people is thinking critically with informed opinions and without biased or selfish information published in the media. 
There are a lot of people invested and they all try to convince each other that everything will be fine and there is no reason to sell, that way price won't drop. And I can prove this; did you see the media and community denying the China ban of exchanges? It was a complete circle jerk of people trying to convince each other it was just FUD and fake news, and nobody worried about the truth. 
Obviously the community will reject segwit2x if it could potentially destroy the value of BTC. 


It's still trust no matter how you look at it. What if people in which you trust were coerced by some "evil" organization? How do you know they still truth to what they believe? I'm not saying Core is corrupt, but as I said before, any trust from the community in a group of individuals that has great power, is a point of failure for the system, and therefore the system is prone to fail. Specially if we are fighting against very powerful people. 
The entity you don't seem to recognize are the people in charge of the media and the ones the community trust. This entity is leading, and that can be proved easily if you ask the user base about why they don't support the Segwit2x. You are an example I think, since your main reason is that you trust that Core wants the best for the tech behind Bitcoin. If Core made an announcement tomorrow that they will support Segwit2x, would you support it? Yes, they lead. 
Maybe, some portion of the people that get into BTC is susceptible to trust a group of individuals that in appareance only care about the tech. Other portion just follow the rest. Other portion trust in the organizations supporting the NYA. But, I believe the biggest portion is the one that has no idea of tech/computer science/history of BTC/it's fundamentals/etc.. Those are the user base some individuals are referring to, and that user base is the most susceptible to trust in whatever other people is telling them to trust.

@_date: 2017-09-28 16:15:45
Well, you should be aware Core and the people in charge of some media channels, doesn't want a division either to avoid a potential devaluation and maximize profit. I do say a BIG portion of the community doesn't want a division just to avoid a potential loss in value. 
But, is that correct? Should we let Core deceive 2 times the community by not respecting HK agreement and then the NYA? Who are they to decide the future of BTC and influence the opinion of the masses. If we let this slide, BTC will surely fail, since it's already too centralized around this image of Core. And you as an old bitcoin user, you should be aware how dangerous that could be for the future of BTC against powerful governments.
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:38:59
Why did you buy BTC then? If BTC is a currency that cannot be used to pay for stuff, what's it's purpose for you? 
I know the answer :)
But, BTC has much more uses apart from being used as a currency though (transferring value, have value people can't confiscate from you, make people rich?, etc..), however it's usage as a currency is a very important one too. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:50:34
Cryptos from banks and cryptos independent of banks have probably a market. I mean, there is a big portion of the world wide population that wouldn't trust their money in an open source project, because they even don't know what's an open source project. 
I believe though, public cryptos will end up winning the war of private vs. public. Because intermediaries and most financial institutions will end up being removed because of decentralized technology (like smart contracts), but it will be a hard war anyway.  
Anyone saying we already won the war, is being dellusional, and instead should really prepare to defend their ideals. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:32:26
I can see you are beginning to doubt about your beliefs. 
Sadly, though, you are misinterpreting a lot of what I'm saying. 
I do believe everything will be fine, but not right now. 
I sold my coins at 4300 USD at the Chinese news that was called fake news, because I didn't believe in the circle jerk that was calling it fake news (90+% of the community).
Actually, I don't trust Core when I use it's software. I trust the whole domain of people that can see and analyze the code.
You seem like you just started in the crypto space. I have been reading about this for years now, and it's a very complex world already. But as I supposed, it's hard to have a critical point of view if you are just starting, and recently we had a massive inflow of people, and they are taking the place of the "user base". 
You didn't address a lot of  the important stuff I said, and instead you "transferred" it to me arguing that I also trust Core Lol. It's fine though, I will stop arguing, however, because it's pointless since I know you trust in your judgement (I'm like that too).

@_date: 2017-09-29 18:27:28
Yes, they have decided to trust and follow Core, do you see how that could be a problem?
Core is a group of developers that reach an internal consensus, making a decision to support or not to support certains BIPs. As such, Core is not a neutral entity; it has an opinion that arises from their technical expertise as a whole. Since the group has an opinion and it supports it's opinion publicly, and since the majority of the community has decided to trust and follow them, the opinion of Core becomes the opinion of the community, thus the consensus of the "whole". 
The problem comes from the fact Core is not simply developing and proposing changes to the protocol. In fact, Core and relatives (like some people of blockstream which also have voice and trust in the community), is engaging in a political agenda and it's trying to impose what they believe is good for the community and for BTC, instead of simple doing it's job of improving the protocol and letting the community choose. 
I believe Core is prioritizing technical advacements in the best way they know (like good computer scientists), and they are not considering different perspectives. For example, not a while ago, Bitcoin had a huge problem of unconfirmed transactions (before segwit), and the economy around BTC suffered a lot because of it, impending the economic growth and damaging the existing one. A temporal solution that could have solve those problems temporaly and let the economy growth, would have been increase the block size limit. But the developers didn't want to do it, because from a computer science point of view, it would have been better to find the best possible definetely solution for the transactions problem. And thus, they stagnated the economy for a while, believing that that's what BTC and it's community needed. 
Now my question is, was that what it really needed at that moment considering also it's future? Why they choosed for us, while the majority of the community wanted low fees, empty mempool and fast transactions? Now the community is very different, but at that moment it wasn't. 
So, what's impeding Core in the future to negate a future community proposal and use their power to influence the community ?
The NYA comes from this; a broken relation between Core and the ecosystem and community that suffered from Core's decisions. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:51:06
Core devs are just Core devs. It's just one part of the community, not the whole. 
But, new users tend to follow them without thinking by themselves. And then, other people use the argument, "segwit2x is against consensus, because the community doesn't want it". But the truth is the community right now is 80% of new users.
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:40:45
Tell me, why you bought BTC? Because you wanted to pay for goods in internet? You bought to be rich with your retarded and toxic "hodl" strategy that's is causing a shortage of BTC in the market at some points, and thus allowing this bubble to be alive for few weeks more.

You believe the same I do apparently. If big players were to support Segwit2x, dump their Bitcoins and buy Segwit2x Bitcoins, or simply put money from their pocket to support Segwit2x, that coin would become the default Bitcoin probably. 
In this scenario minor users (which some people use them to define consensus) wouldn't matter. Miners would shift to the new chain and the legacy chain would need an emergency PoW change.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:20:27
If you don't believe Core actually care about profit I will cite Gregory Maxwell:

But people doesn't care about Bitcoin, they care about how much fiat they can get for selling BTC. So, you actually just need to ban banks from dealing with it, and a lot of people will sell, specially big holders. 
In the end however, just the guys who care about the tech and understand it will remain and the people that use Bitcoin as a ponzi will sell.

Wow, he clearly doesn't understand Bitcoin at all nor other cryptos. 
Bitcoin is valuable in principle because of it's network effect; mining, usage, acceptance, social perception, "inmutability" and security that arises from a lot of miners hashing. 
You can't just create a coin and convince people to buy it for 4k USD, and convince people to accept it. Apart from the fact nobody would think the coin is valuable, it would be very dangerous without a big mining network since it would be easy to launch a 51% on it.
I'm glad there is a lot of ignorance in regard with cryptos, since that give us a big competitive advantage.
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:20:58

@_date: 2017-09-28 12:18:04
Lot of core developers signed a similar agreement, in a supposed "closed room", argument that many use now against the NYA agreement.
They didn't find a 2mb increase to be good from a technical point of view probably, and even though the community was crying for a block size increase, they managed to convince everyone such an increase is bad an unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:40:24
I believe what I'm saying is very clear:
-Core and relatives doesn't want a division and they are trying to protect Bitcoin from one. 
-Media is also manipulated to protect Bitcoins from divisions. 
-Core is using their technical expertise to determine what's good for Bitcoin and it's supporting it's vision in public channels. Even if core doesn't want to implant their ideas in the community, it's doing it as a side effect. 
My opinion is simple, if the community want to follow a fork that's not aligned with Core's ideals, let it be.
@_date: 2017-09-24 04:15:31
They could close any account related to in any way to BTC. I think, some countries will take this approach, but others will embrace the cryptos.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:59:42
Well, for the HK agreement where Core developers agree about certain points, you didn't receive an email either, right? 
Segwit2x is more than just solving technical issues. Let me ask you something, if Core were to support segwit2x, would you follow ? I see the whole conflict coming to an end if that were to happen, and that's is a problem because that's a point of failure for BTC. 
But apart from that fundamental problem which is much bigger than any technical problem, I believe Segwit2x soften the value shift from the Blockchain to LN channels operators, and might reduce some risks about the transition to lightning.
About the citation, Gregory clearly mentioned he's invested in BTC, and if you don't take the word "value" out of context, it's clear he's refering to the monetary value of BTC.
I will stop arguing though, I got tired, and arguing in internet is pointless.

Some people could say consensus of the community is what decides it. But, if Core (the open-source group of developers) supported Segwit2x, the community would follow and consensus would shift. 
So, basically Core is what makes the final decision. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:58:19
If segwit2x is shit, why people is so scared about it?
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:39:47
I'm saying that, because the agreement is coming from the trust in an entity and media manipulation (but I won't dive into that). I know it's a harsh comment, but that's why I said "at this stage".
 
I believe BTC as a community and protocol could be greatly improved to deal with the problems that make it now a failed experiment in my opinion. And I know it will be improved in the future and nobody will be able to stop it. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:04:10

@_date: 2017-10-02 17:29:19
I would like to begin my response from what the community wanted when we had scaling problems due to the limited block size before segwit.
One of the problems that arises from a non empty mempool, is that your transaction competes with others to be included in a block, as you are probably aware. The highest fee transaction in a certain domain has priority over the other transaction in the same domain. As such, people was paying very high fees to have their transactions inluded in the next block. This problem caused a lot of companies providing services over the BTC network, to have problems. Bitpay is one example of those companies, since to buy a product you had to pay a significant premium caused from the high fees. This resulted in Bitpay losing customers and a damage of the image of BTC as a payment system. The high fees not only caused the previous problem, but also made Bitcoin to lose market share to altcoins.
From the perspective of a regular user, I'm quite confident the high fees was just a hassle, and the quest to find the best solution to the scaling problems and avoid a minimal block size increase to allievate the congestion problems, was just a pure computer science problem. 
I myself was present in such conflict, and my opinion was that a big block size increase would lead to centralization and that was undesirable, but a small block size increase as a temporal solution would have help a lot the ecosystem. Until now, I believe what Core tried to do was the typical mistake of CS, to find the best possible solution and stagnate the project until you find one and implement it, instead of improve over a more basic solution (very similar to optimize the code in the very beginning of a project).
Now, I don't believe consensus in Bitcoin is like a democracy where 1 person equals to 1 vote. I believe it's more similar to price discovery in a market; for example, if you have a big stake of Bitcoin or a big amount of money, you can increase/decrease the price of Bitcoin dramatically, and the price of Bitcoin is extremely important for the security of the network and it's fundamental value.
Imagine Satoshi Nakamoto participating in the market, and dumping 4 millions Bitcoins to later buy Segwit2x coins with that amount of money. That would cause a dramatically shift in the mining network towards Segwit2x and would kill the Core's blockchain (unless they perform a HF to change the PoW algorithm). Do you see now why 1 person can't equal to 1 vote?
I said the previous thing, because just as like a big holder of Bitcoin has "more voice" over consensus, I believe companies supporting the ecosystem significantly have a higher relevance over users who dumped their life savings to buy 0.5 BTC, because those companies have a big relevance influencing the price of BTC. I believe the same holds true for the miners, and for the developers. Measuring consensus in Bitcoin based in simple numbers of users supporting a certain fork, is wrong.
This doesn't mean I support a certain band, and I don't believe segwit2x is a big improvement, but at least it's a chance to begin from the start again and it's something different from Core's BTC that already made mistakes in the past and it's already too centralized around developers and relatives. 
With respect to the "agenda" I mentioned. What I meant was that Core and Blockstream are engaging in political discussions trying to influence the user base of Bitcoin in their favor. I don't know if I can agree with conspiracy theories over Blockstream, but I believe it's a very real possibility. But, I know some developers have monetary interests over Bitcoin (I have talk with one of them), and that's a big problem in my opinion, specially if they have such power.
In relation with your opinion that Blockstream would also benefit from having bigger block size, I don't think thats neccesarily true, because if there is a bigger block size, more transactions could be done in it, avoiding in part LN channels. 
My last objection of Core, would be the fact they would leave Bitcoin if Segwit2x succeed. I don't know how to interpret that, they don't want to lose power over the project? They are stubborn enough that they would leave a multi billion dollar worth potentially world-changing technology? They believe if S2X succed the Bitcoin experiment is a failure and not worth the time?
I believe, Core is doing something similar to what Hitler did. They are believing blindly that what they see as good is what's the real good for the society. Many problems have arise in the history of humanity from such "doctrine"? Noone is able to tell what's really good for us.
Segwit2x might be the bad guys in the movie, or maybe it's Core, I don't know and I won't support any of them. But, I'm sure however, that Core (including Blockstream and some people in charge of the media channels related to BTC) was a problem in the past, and it's a potential problem in the future.
Last but not least, just as bigger block size would cause centralization, LN hubs would also cause centralization:
I still believe however Segwit is a really big technology improvement that will allow Bitcoin to scale, but why not have a distributed centralization over a big blockchain and LN hubs?

Lol. It's down, usually those exchanges go offline frequently, still scary.

The problem as I explained in another response, is that *we* know that, but normal people won't get it that way. Just remember how mtgox was considered the institution behind bitcoin; mtgox died -&gt; Bitcoin died. 
The world is a very complex thing, and there is a vast number of opinions much different than ours. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:42:21
I see. I actually agree with your theory. 
From this point of view, I believe it would be better to not have a trust-based development team in a trust-less protocol, and also the code might be even better if it's immutable and the mathematical rules are unchangeable and publicly known. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:59:01
Exactly my thoughts. They way he's defending his financial interests is disgusting. He's fucking scared to loss his ass if the price of BTC drops, and for that he's using manipulative language. 
I can't hardly stand behind one the of two sides, but this kind of comments and manipulation is simple wrong and it just direct you far away of the truth. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:27:57
Inside trading maybe. Segwit2x could be locked in today if magically some miners returned to signaling it, but you don't know if they are doing it until they mine a block.  
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:47:03
If I'm not mistaken, the price of BCC is high enough so they will mine it with a hash power corresponding to the value of that coin, right?
People was thinking that Bitcoin Cash wasn't going to get over the high difficult it was going to have, and eventually was going to die? 
I also see a lot of confusion, because there are articles from trusted sources that say there won't be a chain split, and they said it explicitly. I was too under that impression and saw some people asking if there is going to be a split.

RIP. At least he bought his coins

7 years ago:
Since Bitcoin was created, shouldn't the technology be already priced in?
Well, market is very dumb sometimes.

I'm all in too bro, let's ride this together or die trying :)

You seem to be deeply confused about my deeply confusion. 
I know Bitcoin is an open source project and I know the dynamics of it. Hopefully that should resolve your doubts. 
Now that's clear, I'm saying Core has such power to manipulate popular opinion because that's how Core is seeing by non tech savvy people who don't understand Open Source projects. Bitcoin is trying to be legitimized as the original Bitcoin and many opponents of BCC are using names such as "altcoin", "not original bitcoin", which is a complete misleading stuff. 
Core's power is legitimated by it's name and image which is usually used by normal people to judge what's good and what's bad; just like politics where people doesn't give a fuck about real capacity of presidents to lead a country. We are in the presence of the same problem here.
I believe there shouldn't be any concrete entity behind this project, not even a name for it. Otherwise the accumulation of power is inevitable and with it the capacity to manipulate non informed opinions (e.g. normal people in the real world), and Bitcoin is exactly trying to aim to this part of the population to gain mass adoption. 
I can keep explaining my point of view, but this is internet, you won't really consider it probably.

Well, bitfury just started to signal BIP 91. I wouldn't be surprised if people in a small circle already knew it before everyone else.

I'm not talking about setting the price. You are misinterpreting my statement. 
I'm just expressing a direct relation between the decrease in price and the unwillingness to sell the asset, specially in this case, since your asset can drastically increase in price. Instead the Computer's value is always decreasing once you buy it.
 
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:28:56
Any source for this? I didn't find anything.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:13:11
The fact "Core" is a thing is just wrong. There shouldn't be an entity with such power and "recognition" capable of manipulating popular opinion. The same way there shouldn't be any centralization in mining. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:16:41
This is wrong. High risk -&gt; low price. Once the risk is lowered, the price might actually increase, just like bitcoin price is increasing and it was very low when it was a complete risk investment (0.1 USD).
I believe people will dump though, and it will be a massive dump/pump war.
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:05:40
I know. I just felt bad about him and his probably noble intentions (at least, he truly believe in bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:48:19
People answering this have no idea of nothing. 
If you paid 500 USD for your computer, how much are you willing to sell it in the next price ranges?
There you have your answer.
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:07:38
Do you believe the future drastic transition to Segwit will damage it's trust in immutability and thus damaging it's gold-like quality? 
I saw you arguing against an increase in the blocksize and I'm wondering if you consider this change to be different.
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:06:32
Well, sorry for being like this, I just got angry at your comment and I'm not having a good day.

Does this mean Bitcoin ABC won't happen?
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:35:16
The capital flows into bitcoin from 2 sources: direct buyers and miners. The last pay electricity to produce Bitcoins, but this figure depends in the network difficulty, ASIC technology and block reward. 
I believe the cost of producing one bitcoin is like a floor for the price, and since miners are always increasing, this floor gets higher. 
You might be able to calculate the average people paid for bitcoin using volume statistics from different exchanges and the history of the price. Also, it's probably easy to obtain an estimation of the money spent in electricity; you would need to keep track of the chip's efficiency of ASICs and network hash rate.

You could also say segwit Bitcoin is an altcoin, what's the criteria to differentiate? Even more, big block bitcoin is more like the current bitcoin...So, it's pointless to try to validate segwit coin this way.
I'm not pro BCC, I just want a decentralized Bitcoin without a small group dictating it's destiny.
