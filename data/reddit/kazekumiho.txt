I'm not fake-grovelling, I honestly don't see any value in arguing with someone on Reddit over something so trivial. I mean, you've been a bit unnecessarily arrogant, but I can get over that too. I really don't care.


This is not "pointing out." This is a request.

That's fair, I mean it seemed pretty blunt but I've also been working all day (with the occasional Reddit break), so that's probably part of it. 
I understand the frustration, I'll keep that in mind from now on. Someone above explained the nature of the situation to me with a post, which was really insightful.

Well I mean I wanted to get a feel for what it was all about, what's so wrong with that?

Ok, I see how it's repetitive, but how is this doing the spammer's dirty work? Haven't I made it clear that this message came from some random-ass unrelated person? I don't think anyone is going to read this and think "Gee, this guy has a real good point, I'm ditching Bitcoin" when I'm just asking them to tell me about it or explain why it's silly.

Funny thing is, I just checked out "New" section and there was a guy posting about ethereum.

I still disagree, but whatever. I wouldn't want to piss off a member of the sub for something so inconsequential.

Spam, eh? Figured. The actual ethereum people seem quite nice and reasonable, so I'm glad you linked me this post. :) Thanks for the tip, I'll use it wisely on a comment I see worthy!

Yes, but he's expecting unsuspecting people to be reading it. I'm going to a subreddit filled with experts or hobbyists of that topic, who should have no problem distinguishing it from worthy text?
No, but again, because I understand it, why I'm getting it, etc. I wasn't aware of all of that with respect to this specific spam post. But look man, I don't want to fight. If it would really make your day, I can delete the thread, no biggie.
