You can email me directly at pieter at hintjens dot com. Createspace are Amazon's print-on-demand service, so that is where the paper copies come from, no matter how one pays. However I'm happy to receive as much BTC as makes sense, and then send a signed copy of the book wherever you like.

Start a criticism with insult... troll level 1 achieved!


ZeroMQ uses NaCl to give [perfect-forward security]( The current 4.2 master has NaCl built in so you don't need an external package to get this. It's automatic.


Citation please. There were small ABI changes in new areas that should have been flagged as "draft". There were no protocol breaks as *it is the same protocol.* And 4.x will interoperate with 3.x and 2.x stable releases.
Make vague, unsubstantiated claims of "oooh, danger"... troll level 2 achieved.


End with appeal to negative emotions... troll level 3 achieved! Well done, sir.

If you're using libzmq 3.2 you can publish everything and let the subscriber choose (assuming the ticks have a suitable prefix to match on).
First thing would be to define a protocol for the data flow, then to make a few proof implementations of clients in different languages. I'm more than happy to help with this, if it's all open source. The security part could come on top, or you could wait until libzmq 3.3 comes out, which will have it built-in. 
The simplest security model would be trusted server, anonymous clients, so each client has the server long term public key, but the server doesn't authenticate clients.
We can discuss this on the zeromq-dev list, or here, as you like. Usually what I do is create a github repo for source code and specs and then let people join in with pull requests.

Sorry for joining this thread late. I'm willing to help on the technical design. You'll need security, and it's something I'm building for ZeroMQ at the moment ([CurveZMQ](
