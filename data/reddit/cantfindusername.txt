I don't mind having to give them ID and all that, but the fact they allowed me to purchase $50 worth of Bitcoin that is now tied up in my account is annoying. I've been trying to use it for days but I am *still* waiting for them to finish their review process. It should be part of the sign up process...

I’ve been on a free student account pretty much my whole life, even though I haven’t been in university for like 3 years. It wasn’t until I was at the bank having a meeting about a few things and they told me I’d need to start paying for my account. Cheapest was $4 a month I think, but it was very limiting, only like 10 transactions a month... I’ll be switching to a free credit union account when they tell me my account is expiring. They already charge enough fees just for moving my money.

If Bitcoin Cash wants to be its own cryptocurrency, they should sell/donate Bitcoin.com so that it can redirect to Bitcoin.org. Right now, it’s clearly confusing and they’re doing it on purpose. It’s not Bitcoin, it’s BCash or Bitcoin Cash, so the URL is incorrect.

That’s the thing I’ve wondered about Ripple and others...they have huge amounts available, so isn’t that basically artificially raising the market cap?

I didn't have a problem with Coinbase until my last transaction when I realized they were taking a third of my Bitcoin as fees. Glad I noticed and learnt about moving it to GDAX because I would not have been happy spending that much in fees for no reason. Any new person should find a better exchange IMO or buy direct from GDAX if available. Although no Segwit support is a good enough reason to avoid them entirely.

Well GDAX and coinbase are the same company, but GDAX doesn’t charge the same fees as coinbase. As long as you’re willing to put up with the “complicated” UI, it’s much better. If GDAX isn’t available in your country, like in Canada it’s not, you can still buy from Coinbase and transfer to GDAX to save a ton on fees.

Just don't invest with other people. It doesn't take long to buy Bitcoin, if your friend wants to be involved they can do it themselves. You can't predict the future, maybe one day they'll change or something will happen between you two. You never know. There's no benefit to sharing a Bitcoin wallet. Its just an unnecessary risk. Let them do what they want with their money and handle the risks on their own.

There are a few reasons, but I think one of the main issues with it for a lot of people is one of the guys behind it, Roger Ver and co. [This post]( is a pretty good one to read. Basically made Bitcoin Cash (which should always be called Bcash to avoid confusion), which is a clone of Bitcoin using the same name to essentially trick people into buying it. He's made clear that he wants it to be called Bitcoin as you can see him freak out in [this video.]( I'm far from an expert so I can't go into the complicated details, but you could look it up in this sub. Basically, a lot of lies and false claims. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:32:50

If Bcash was just an alt coin that was trying to do things differently, I'd respect it. But after seeing Roger Ver's interview about calling it Bitcoin and not Bcash, it's clear to see how they are trying to take over Bitcoin by pretending to be Bitcoin. They are riding off the name being constantly in the news and are basically just riding in its wake. Ethereum and Litecoin has value, neither of which claims to be Bitcoin. I think Bcash will crash and never recover, I mean can you even use it?

Yeah they are ridiculous, not to mention that even when you do contact them, they often don't fix the problem. I've been with a bank and a credit union and both have had their issues. They were sending important documents to my old house for months, even after multiple calls and meetings with the bank. Thankfully we knew the homeowners so our stuff wasn't just going to a stranger. I got a $5 charge the other day for moving my own money from my CC to my savings account. I had $300 extra on my CC from a refund, but apparently I had to pay a cash advance fee to get it back... Really stupid. I'd gladly never use banks, it's not like my CC rewards are any good either.

The other day I was trying to send Bitcoin from Coinbase to my wallet, but the fees on Coinbase were literally a third of what I had bought. It was almost $25 and I'd bought $75. I'm glad I noticed, I wonder how much I've lost to Coinbase fees. I moved it over to GDAX after that.

I've read some of their comments and I must say, they are very convincing. Without doing your own research, you could look at the "facts" they post and be very surprised by the pros of bcash. But if you actually know the truth, it's not that convincing. Then you realize a lot of them are just spreading misinformation and stuff like that. If you had no knowledge of cryptocurrency or you aren't up to date and you came on to Reddit to decide what to buy, I can see why people would go with Bcash based on what that sub says. They are very anti Bitcoin, much more than we are.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:12:28
I wouldn't sell it. You're one of the few that has a whole Bitcoin. There's a chance we'll hit 20k by 2018, selling now would be missing out on thousands of dollars. I get that it's a lot of money, but I wouldn't cash it all out.

I'm not going to sell my BTC, but when I moved all of my BTC to my hardware wallet, it was $20 or $60 to move them. I wanted to test by sending a small amount, but it was way too expensive. I'm sure this will be solved in the future, but until then it is way too expensive to use.

My dad told me that his friend said everyone should sell their Bitcoin when it was at 16k. Well now it's back.

I just started working full time, I have pretty much no expenses and I own 0.017 BTC right now. The first time I bought Bitcoin was months ago to pay for something online, just thought it would be a fun thing to try. Anyway, I had a 10% off coupon so 10% of the Bitcoin I had bought, never ended up being used. It just sat there until a few weeks ago I logged in and realized I had $25 in Bitcoin. Considering I had only spent about $50 on the initial Bitcoin I bought, getting half of it back really excited me. I bought some more and I now have $85 worth, but I'm considering investing more into it. I have a "high interest" savings account with my bank and so far I haven't made a dollar. The money I earn right now is pretty much disposable income, maybe I should buy into Bitcoin a bit more. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:09:47

Yeah, a lot of people caught on earlier, but this year has been the year when it has made huge price increases for the first time in years. It was pretty stagnant since like 2013. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:50:02
Considering the rise this year, 14k seems like something we'll hit in early 2018.

Good job. But apparently showing your exact Bitcoin balance online is a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:49:18
I said the other day that I'd buy more if the price dipped below $7000 CAD, it did and now it's up to $8500 CAD. Crazy stuff. I'm expecting a dip too, but I'm also not surprised if it just keeps rising.

@_date: 2017-11-26 10:11:47
I started with $50 and now that $50 is worth over $100 in less than a year. I’ve invested more since then, but my point is that it’s free money basically. Obviously you won’t get rich for quite a while with only $50 but it’s something. Just buy some and forget about it. Just make sure you put your Bitcoin on a wallet and not leave it on the exchange.

@_date: 2017-11-22 02:12:44
I think this is why it's best not to involve anyone you know with your bitcoin. Bitcoin is so new, most people know nothing about it but will still have opinions from what they've seen on the news over the years. Like, "Bitcoin is for buying drugs because I saw it on the news talking about Silk Road." Well, the same could be said about dollars being used to buy drugs.

I don't know what the best exchange is in Europe, but Coinbase is easy if it works for you. 
Yes you should invest if you don't mind potentially losing the money. Bitcoin **might** dip soon, since we're about to hit $10k and it there's a chance the price will drop for a while. But there's no guarantee so just buy if you want. 
You get started by buying however much you can afford, then transferring that Bitcoin from the exchange to a wallet of your choice. 
Bitcoin is the original, the real Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is a "fork" which means someone basically came along and made a new type of coin and gave it the Bitcoin name, but it's not Bitcoin, if anything it's a scam to trick people like you into buying Bitcoin Cash and thinking it's real. 
Don't use the Bitcoin.com app, Bitcoin.com is a big supporter of Bitcoin Cash, bitcoin.org is the "real" bitcoin website. There are a lot of wallets out there, I use Breadwallet on my phone, but I'll probably get a hardware wallet soon. Just search this sub and pick a wallet you like the sound of. The most secure is a hardware wallet and a paper wallet, since they're offline and can't be hacked.

Why? Many people have got rich from bitcoin, investing $10k isn’t that crazy. It’s a lot of money, but not uncommon. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:37:45
As a Canadian, I always feel richer than I really am when looking at Bitcoin pricing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:27:08
Well that's because it's less profitable to give users a choice. Sales of higher capacity phones would go down if they put in a micro SD slot.
I don't agree with it, but it's business. Apple isn't in the business of being good to their customers either.

Bitcoin might reach whatever number you want to write down.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:46:34
Exactly. They aren't bothered about *having* bitcoin, it's too risky for most companies to even consider. They're just giving customers another way to pay.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:39:46
Can you cash it out? Then buy with your bank or credit card.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:37:03
It is scary. Every dollar I invest, I just think of it as "personal enjoyment money". Some people buy alcohol, some people buy food, I like bitcoin. If I lose it, life goes on. I don't plan on selling anytime soon and if it drops, I'll wait it out. But taking out a loan to invest money is ridiculous. Bitcoin *will* go up and down, but we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow let alone in a month or a year. Don't lose other people's money with something as risky as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:28:01
Bcash is Bitcoin Cash, a fork of bitcoin. Basically just another coin, with the bitcoin name but not really bitcoin at all. It was on the rise and Bitcoin was dipping, so people were swapping over to Bitcoin Cash thinking it would shoot up in value, but Bitcoin rebounded and Bitcoin Cash did the opposite.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:14:05
I'm 21, I've put a decent amount into bitcoin, at least for me since I don't earn much. It's money I don't mind losing, I don't really spend on things like drinking and stuff, so I spend on bitcoin instead.

I don't get these articles. Anyone can assume that bitcoin is going to rise, it's not exactly hard to see given what has happened all year. Saying it's going to go up a few hundred dollars isn't very drastic, it's come to be expected.

Nothing is certain. It could shoot up this weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:34:46
I think the idea is that it will become mainstream enough that you won't need to sell your bitcoin, you can just spend it as you would with any cash. But that doesn't mean fiat will disappear, probably more like coexist.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:22:15
There's a good chance it will drop, but there are no guarantees. For all we know, it might skyrocket.

To be fair, it didn't work on stage because the phone had too many failed attempts and required a password. All phones do this, the reason the iPhone X did it was because people had been looking at the phone (people besides Tim Cook), so when he went to unlock it, it was locked from too many failed attempts. I'm not defending the iPhone X, I think it's a ridiculously expensive phone that I'd never even consider, but it did what it was supposed to, so that's good.
@_date: 2017-09-20 09:29:23

A lot of people flash new OS's, it's very common among normal consumers. I have a Xiaomi Mi5, I flashed LineageOS when I got the phone because I wanted a more stock android feel. Then I flashed MIUI a few months ago to try out how Xiaomi's OS is. Then I flashed the new version of LineageOS, but I preferred the performance and battery life of MIUI so I flashed a custom version called Xiaomi.EU which is an unofficial version of MIUI with a few changes. 
It's still android, it's just different versions. It's not difficult at all, if you can plug your phone into a pc, you can flash a new OS and gain a lot of new features.
