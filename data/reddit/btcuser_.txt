This was one of the best crypto music videos I've seen, good job!

Apparently so, isn't the point of acronyms to reduce the amount of typing? I'd argue using k takes more time lol, but 0 is not nearly as cool tho.
@_date: 2019-07-10 09:13:39
Can you push the cable all the way in please? Nice art btw, I like it.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:49:10
Top fucking kek. The noobs are flowing strong. Quick! Sell the bottom and buy the top later!!! /s
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:33:54
This is actually going to happen, no bamboozles. 100K EOY.
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:31:30
Why not just use a 0 instead of k?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:43:26
It works, just not if you set your network fee to low.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:22:56
Krakens site and customer support is shit show, as is Geminis, Coinbase is no different but with higher fees! Bitstamp is okay, haven't had issues with inbound wires and their site is pretty stable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:41:21
Ah, that sucks, I got out of the habbit of using CB, switched to bitstamp/kraken, never looked back. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:17:38
Shillmode Bitstamp hasn't let me down yet, used cb, Gemini, kraken, bitterex
@_date: 2019-07-18 07:49:40
You should apply this principle to every aspect of life, imo.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:01:10
"The big question is; what can you do about it?". I'm going have to go with... buy all the Bitcoins. Great video.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:02:13
Incorrect, see above "If your purchase fails, Steam will save your shopping cart (at the sale price) for three days (exactly 72 hours) so you can try to make your purchase again. Any discounts applied to your failed purchase will be saved, even if they are no longer available in the Steam store."
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:01:45
Wait, you guys haven't already sold your bch? I sold that shit months ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:42:07
Amazingly high fees, weeks to attain purchased bitcoin and downtime during critical purchasing opportunities. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:39:48
Can we please ban "BREAKING" in titles? Please....
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:07:28
Why do you say this?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:43:48
It is Steams fault for not allowing me to purchase the item with the sale price, as they promised...
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:20:44
What do you mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:43:10
But without the discount, which is the problem.
@_date: 2018-09-27 12:48:10
So, you're shilling sentiments? Nice...
@_date: 2019-11-18 18:42:43
And your regret will be selling at 100k on the way up to 360k

Hey, they could have had multiple farms!
@_date: 2018-10-24 10:35:01
pepperidge farms 
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:08:13
I'll believe it when it happens.
@_date: 2019-08-18 06:09:20
Said for the 5th time in the past 3 days. We get it.
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:50:21
This. If enough people believe in something, it self fulfills.
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:20:30
What is up with all of the articles about this topic being mass downvoted? This is big news, I smell astroturf. Meanwhile, on this topic has hundreds of upvotes.
@_date: 2019-02-23 11:51:31
Yeah well! I think both of your comments are pretentious! "Why are kids on Reddit complaining about internet posts" 
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:13:57
That was actually way better than I thought it was going to be. Take my internet point.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:33:55
Okay, I think I can do that...!
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:24:00
It's sad, truly, but this... :(  sorry friend.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:24:48
I designed it using one of those "make your own jacket" sites. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:07:22
lol, at least I know you're a btc bro.
@_date: 2019-02-23 11:48:23
Interesting stuff today in the markets, let's see what happens.
@_date: 2019-12-27 21:44:49
While that might be true, if and and when a recession does hit, and you do need cash on hand, I'd much rather be cashing out of a market that is on the flip side of a popping bubble. To each their own :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:11:17
hey man, how I see it, everyone wears clothing with big brands, promoting shit because they're sheep. I'm purposively promoting and informing about Bitcoin, fuck the legacy system and everything that comes with it. Burn the shit down.
@_date: 2019-12-31 08:48:08
I'll pass on a car, I want a house. Outright.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:39:04
Thanks mate, took me longer than I'll admit haha. I'm hoping these will become as popular as the rollarcoaster meme, I tried to keep the art style as close as possible:)
 Here's the other variation I made: 
Bull: 
Bear: 
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:14:49
Okay, I will buy at 50k? Or 100k? Hmmm
@_date: 2019-12-30 00:13:24
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:55:25
Nothing personal, pal!
@_date: 2019-12-26 10:54:45
Dont spread lies. He delisted them to prevent further strikes. 
@_date: 2019-04-24 07:24:22
You sound as if you're in the disbelief stage, imho.  
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:18:42
@_date: 2019-12-31 09:40:02
You have another car...rheoretical post.
Go post this shit on 4chan if you need attention.
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:42:11
Yeah, they did hype it up quite a bit, and now radio silence. Gotta love it.
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:40:32
@_date: 2019-04-24 07:38:38
Lol, I'm guessing you're watching the 15 second charts? Come back in a few months ����
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:13:09
Corrected, ty.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:52:15
:D 
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:26:27
 I kind of wondered about that, I saw a chart for TPS on blockchain but like you said, two sides of a coin.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:13:49
Yes, thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-03 08:27:35
I have used all of the big exchanges, Bitstamp is my favorite. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:22:59
Agreed, it's taken a while for adoption, but it's happening.

As a born and raised (sadly) American living in Sweden and soon Netherlands, you are a prime example of the stupidity in the US. The American dream has always been a fallacy. Sure, work your dick off and work 60 hours a week and have no time for friends, family, or personal enjoyment. Education is a sure fire way to end up with a loan that has a crazy high interest rate, oh yeah and don't have any health problems, again, a sure fire way to end up in debt. Accept it man, the US is a shithole... The sooner you realize and get out, the better off you'll be. Check out my blog if you want to read my story. ThinkingBold.com
@_date: 2019-09-25 21:03:11
This is actually correct.
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:33:46
Not that I don't believe you, and I appreciate your effort in this post, but can someone rebuttable/fact check these points? What actually caused everyone to get so excited about "CBOE BTC ETF"? \*Edit, I dug a bit deeper and it definitely seems like things are over hyped. Damn, no bullrun yet :|
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:12:18
Cmon guys, we can do better. Show this women some love. She represents Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:33:21
Interesting, no sources though.
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:46:57
This, report this shit post.
@_date: 2018-07-27 09:09:17
I think the fallout from Winkie ETF denial is coming to an end.

Request made crypto integration into woo commerce.  I think I'm going to set it up on my shop soon.
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:02:40
This. Please.

I have been running a full node for quite a while now and decided to make the leap. After observing the many pissing matches between the different communities and the people who run large mining operations, I have made a change to hopefully strengthen Bitcoin.
I am one of many and Bitcoin needs you to stand up, I encourage those who believe in Bitcoin and SegWit to do the same. 
The guide I followed: [How To Link](
I support SegWit, long live Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:46:22
I love how ignorant and defiant the opposers are. It really makes you question if they're just defending their own interest, or it's actually that much ignorance. You know that one video of those host talking about email like it's this fake alien technology? Yea, that's this clip in about 5-15 years.
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:00:28
Yeah, one small problem with CoinGate, they don't accept any persons with citizenship or a business registered within the old great USofA.
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:39:47
"We laugh now because we know it's not." - How can you be so sure? I'm genuinely interested. I'm not 100% sure BTC will explode to 10m, but there's the possibility for sure. To say it's simply impossible is very close minded. 
 I've believed in this tech for far too long to stop now, and I truly do believe BTC will compete if not take out and replace the USD as the worlds reserve currency.  To each their own, though, just one mans opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:49:39
in b4 US government created btc
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:20:18
You laugh now. Don't forget people laughed at the idea of $1000 bitcoin back in 2009/10.  It sounds crazy now, but so did it back then, further, it will continue to sound crazy until USD collapses.
