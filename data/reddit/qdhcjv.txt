It just seems pretty logical to me. Actually spending Bitcoin on goods costs an exorbitant amount and takes hours. People are moving to Ethereum, BCH, etc

They're all in the list, and it's written on a piece of paper with info on it that indicates it's at least from summer 2014 or newer. I tried blockchain.io but it doesn't seem to find the mnemonic valid as I cannot click continue, even if I remove the last (13th) word.
edit: that blockchain link you included said one of my words was not valid, though it's in the bip39 word list.

Hmm, so even though the idea is easy to implement AND clearly and undeniably produces a more usable network, it's bad? Ok.

So what's wrong with Bitcoin Cash, in terms of its technological changes? So far, all I've heard is "it's too simple" even though it, thus far, has greatly improved the usability of Bitcoin as a currency.

Or... we could just use a variety of improvements that, while they'll fork the network, will keep the system fast and cheap while maintaining satoshi's vision for a truly distributed, P2P currency...

According to [this chart]( the average transaction fee today (12/19/2017) was $32.07. Last week it was $24.41. This is unbelievable, not the bitcoin I remember from the enthusiast years. It's unusable as a currency. Meanwhile ETH, BCH, and LTC have fees well below a dollar, and transactions complete more quickly. But all this negative news is a controlled lie or something?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:58:03
It still can't seem to get over the absurd TX fees and times, though. It's unusable as a currency.

Setup instructions:
1. Download the provided .deb file in Safari. You should be able to do 'open in: iFile' as long as you have it installed. You need it to install without a PC/Mac, but a computer can install it via SSH too. 
2. Open the containing folder (/var/mobile/Documents/) and select the newly downloaded .deb file. 
3. Tap "Installer". 
4. Upon completion, launch a MobileTerminal/SSH client and run uicache.

It's like a decentralized crypto, except it's all on paper wallets only, but there are no keys, you just look at the number on the paper and that tells you what's it's worth. Completely anonymous in cash form but incredibly insecure. No multisig wallets, or even basic encryption. Your best bet is to put the "cash" (a nickname for the paper wallets) in a locked safe.

While I agree, you need to remember Satoshi didn't know pools would exist. The original plan was that all miners would solo mine, making the only way to get to a 51% is to either buy tons of hardware yourself or hack someone else's rigs.

Tip: don't use ` as an apostrophe. Reddit will format it as code. Use ' instead.
Example. "...didn`t. I guess if Aunt Beatrice isn`t"
With ', it looks like normal text.

I just figured it out: all BTC funds go to a 'Store Credit' fund that I can use to buy games. For some reason the credit menu didn't appear, so I offered to charge $0.01 in BTC as a test. My $60.01 appeared shortly after. Thanks for your response!

At least that doesn't say "Jon -&gt; 5 BTC -&gt; Alice", it says "1ASDFJKL -&gt; 5 BTC -&gt; 1LKJHFDSA" instead. Plus you can generate a new address for every transaction and your wallet will seamlessly combine all the balances.

Bitcoin is both transparent and anonymous. All transactions made are very easily accessible but you can't see a name of who's sending and receiving. There's a crucial difference there.

@_date: 2014-06-12 02:25:18
Assuming they don't wait for verifications, which take over an hour on the Bitcoin network. Most brick and mortar stores don't wait since it's too slow but technically the sender can reverse the transaction if it has no confirms. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 10:47:39
No one reports those because they only appear in circle jerk subs so it doesn't matter. If it happened in, say it'd be down in 5 seconds.

Servers are not desktops, they're servers. Linux is still not even remotely popular on consumer desktops which is why that phrase has sort of become a joke. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:57:32
Those still (for the most part) don't count as "Linux Desktops". Macs are at least desktops but far too modified and locked down to really count. Very, very few people run a Linux distribution as a desktop operating system. Android, tablets, Chromebooks, similar to OS X, are heavily tweaked and aren't exactly desktops anyways. The scene is still dominated by Windows and OS X. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:26:31
A couple things there. 1. No name is attributed to an address, 2. Wallets support owning multiple addresses, making it difficult to track, and 3. Coins can be churned.

I'm on mobile, I thought iPhones have JavaScript, I guess not. I'll wait till I'm home. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:34:43
I mean it would produce around 13k FTC (they're about $.10 apiece)
I don't think it can possibly be this easy. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:12:15
Yeah, and the conversion rate from SHA 256 to scrypt is 1000x slower and the reward system in scrypt currencies is hiked up to convince people to mine.
The 330MH/s is for SHA 256. When used with scrypt, it would get 330kH/s, which is normal and would make about $1 a day.
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:15:06
What's wrong with altcoin currencies? I'm curious. I don't plan to turn a huge profit off mining. I don't want to have to buy the coins for spending, I'm mining so I can a. use them as an 'investment', or b. convert them to USD.
Feathercoin mining makes a lot more than Bitcoin mining...

I have a part time job (only a teenager) and was interested in crypto currency. Mining Bitcoin with a 7870 for a weekend made me a fraction of a cent. Feathercoin actually yields some value: plus I don't think I'm greedy, I'm unable to use my computer while it mines, only for a measly $2 a day. I really just do it for fun. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:29:27
