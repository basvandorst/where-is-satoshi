My 2cents to this whole thing:
What you mean by "personal responsibility and choice" is a thinly veiled security externality in the bitcoin universe that is payed by the customer.
He has to take care of escrow if he wants security otherwise he has to rely on trust. The next problem is that the escrow services itselve are sometimes problematic. You wont even suggest him an escrow service ( for which i dont blame you, i wouldnt either). 
This is really a non trivial problem for the adoption of bitcoin as a general payment system.
In the end i would suggest to use traditional payment methods for the majority of people because it is much more covenient and safer because of ever increasing kyc.
Even with paypal which has a really problematic arbitration system op would easily have got his money back

Ss is not a ponzi. It is a pay-as-you-go system. Those system are in general very bust resistant. 
The ss system of germany for example still works since the late 19th century despite 2 world wars and a hyperinflation.

if bitcoins would replace legacy fiat systems the bitcoin price would be at least at 1 million per bitcoin judging by market capitalization. 
that would be a hundred times more than today. mining profits would roughly rise 100 fold, too. so people are willing to invest 100 times more in mining than today. the price is basically determined by energy cost. with current mining hardware in the current mining environment it would be highly profitable to mine at a kilowatthour price of $8. so whereever the kilowatt price is lower than $8 people have the incentive to mine bitcoins. 
profit margins wil decrease with difficulty adjustment but in order to return to todays proft in terms of dollars earned per bitcoin the number of mininghardware would increase 100 fold, too, given hash efficiency stays the same.
this would be a waste of energy of epic proportions.

no problem,
if you want to store value in gold for your children for example then you have to make sure tu put it somwhere save. for example bury it.
with bitcoin on the other hand you just have to store the keys somewhere save. But you also have to make sure the bitcoin network is still operating in the future. this is what i meant by mining.
edit: this is an argument for gold and against bitcoin as a store of value for the uncertain future

i would disagree. technology has a connection to political ideology in a structural sense.
 for example in the scaling debate of btc vs bch one big issue was wether to increase block size from 1 to 8 mb. this was not only a technical issue but a political one because increased blocksize leads to fewer full nodes. fewer full nodes erodes the democratic structure of the network and could give rise to concentration of power in vewer hands; in this case chinese miners.
in that regard one can say that btc has a more democratic inherent political ideology. 
in contrast to central banks crypto currencies generally are less authoritarian

in germany the taxman also speculates on rising bitcoin value and will tax you by the first in first out principle. they look at the bitcoin value and how many bitcois you traded in for the 1000USD. if it were 0.1 bitcoin they look how much you did pay for your first 0.1 bitcoin. then they slap the capital gains tax on that difference.
 they dont care for that ps4 becouse the bitcoins for that you received later than your first btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:44:16
Transactionfees (per block) have to be higher than mining expenses. Mining expenses are dependent on the difficulty. The difficulty algorithm is there to ensure the 10min block time. The difficulty is dependent on hashpower and therefore dependent on mining expenses. You have a feedback loop here.
On the other hand transactionfees are dependent on the number of transactions in relation to blocksize. Basically if there are no full blocks then transactilnfees would be practically zero (not exactly zero because of spam transactions).
 I think for the fee you would have a partial differential equation.
Edit: totally forgot the btc price. Got to include that, too.

the problem with big money shorting it is that once a downward trend is established it is hard to turn that around especially with that kind of money. when ppl jump on the short train you need lot of people willing to invest in btc. and then all of a sudden you have people with lots of money with an interest in falling bitcoins. spreading FUD will be profitable.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:19:42
the problem with the bitcoin protocol is that it is more or less democratic and thereby very conservative. it is very hard to introduce change, just look at the scaling debate.
your proposal would render all specialised mining hardware useless. i would suggest that this would unify the big miners against your proposal. 
the miners lost some political power in the scaling debate (in wich some miners attempted a power grab) but they were split. 
your proposal would threaten their existence and i think they would successfully prevent such a proposal.

bitcoins intrinsic value is its utility in transfering money across the world, among other things. if you were to put a value (in terms of future cahsflows) to that utility then you would have tu subract the energycosts (in terms of future cahsflows) from that value to get the intrinsic value.

i do think a lot of people invest in bitcoin based on a promises. the promise that tomorrow bitcoin will be worth more than today. that is reflected by the fear of missing out on huge profits driving lots of people to bitcoin.

it really does discourage spending. if this is a good or bad thing is to some extend a political standpoint as you see in the other answers.
if bitcoins really get adopted in a national economy where this could be a real problem then holding bitcoins will probably get taxed. this counters hodl and ensures that you either spend or invenst your bitcoins. especially if you have to pay your bitcoin taxes in bitcoins.
property tax is similar. property is limited (it gets more complicated with declaration of building land etc, but the comparison fits somewhat). you have to pay to hold property. if you dont add value its gonna cost you. for this reason economists call property tax a good tax.
(ethereum fits even more because eth could be seen as a needed recource for smart contracts. i dont know how much that can be done in segwit) 
 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:43:51
Will get fixed i hope. After bitcoin is established it should get taxed like property. If not its going to be disastreous for bitcoin. Value will go up until it crashes. Also the taxes should be payed in bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-14 16:08:12
I think people are buying to store value and ofcourse speculate. 
If you look at the past bitcoin was mainly used in non regulated markets ie drugs. With the advent of sec regulated bitcoin derivate trades a lot more hedgeing and speculation is possible. 
I think in the near Future bitcoin will leave the Drug markets more and more to altcoins such as monero and will flourish areas such as money transfer (think everything western union) and most probably wealth hiding, tax evasion, gambling, corruption.
These markets are huge. Most of them dont like volatility thats why i think another bitcoin boom will occur when hedgeing btc will be easily available. 
Edit: see LedgerX
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:03:48
The tech does matter and the speculation reflects anticipated value. 
Internet black market economy was the first real use of bitcoins. 3rd world countries will see a rise in bitcoin usage because of monetary restrictions imposed by governments. I also think hiding of wealth in general will be more and more done with bitcoin. 
Especially with the introduction of sec regulated derivate trade more people will get into bitcoin becaue then it will be possible to hedge against volatility.

Assuming you are only into bitcoin as an Investment, wait for seg2x hf. If it goes smoothly (meaning no2x) bitcoin will rise again. Otherwise things stay uncertain.
Educate yourself about segwit , 2x, bitcoin itself and things like lightning and other things on the horizon. If you understand bitcoin and its possible(future) uses you will worry less. Unless ofcourse things like segwit2x etc threaten bitcoin. Actually after learning about bitcoin things could look even more scary... well, be optimistic and take the usual investment advises. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:33:07
this has me worried, too.
it all depends on the question how important the darknet drug market is for bitcoin. in the past it definately was important. today there are more uses for bitcoins than back then and with that bitcoins get more accepted by the mainstream in a self reinforcing cycle.
today a lot of people are looking into bitcoin because a lot of governments want to limit cash. bitcoins are far more convenient than gold. for example india banned their two highest denominated bills which gave rise to bitcoins there ([article about that](
EDIT: one of the reasons many central banks try to limit cash is because if there is enough cash then interest rates cannot really sink below 0 minus costs of renting a vault. since 2008 the (mainstream) financial sector realised that there is a need for negative interest rates.
now for the darknet economy (mostly drugs):
as long as drugpolicy stays the same there is a high demand in darknet markets because advantages of darknet vs traditional means to aquire drugs
the good scenario:
same things happens like after the silkroad bust. more new markets emerge and everything gets more decentralised.
in this scenario the darknet drug economy should suffer a similar or even lesser blow than when silkroad got busted
bad scenario:
law envorcement did parallel construction of evidence and the real reason for the busts is that tor is compromised.
one hint for that could be [this](
alternative means for privacy like ethereums mysterium has (in their current proposals) serious man in the mittle attack flaws that could be exploited by law enforcement (see [this link](
in this scenario the darknet economy could suffer a serious blow for a longer period of time

investment is down when gdp is constricting. see 2008 for example. post 2008 consumer debt went down (people were saving or paying down debt) resulting in reduced consumption and as well as investment.
