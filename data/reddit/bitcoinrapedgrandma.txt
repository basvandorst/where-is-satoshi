What if Bitcoin proves we need centralized currency?
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:48:22
Centralized currency were created specifically for stable economic growth.  Bitcoin in 10 years has deviated stability 100000% more centralized currency.  I think it's proving the need...the reason we have in the first place...centralized currency.

Screamed...like a lot.
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:45:00
What is the difference? Bitcoin can lose 85% of its value..uh..
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:52:31
Centralized is actually controlled by the people. The FED is independent but only within a narrow perimeter defined by the people and contrary to popular belief the FED is watched closely.  It's not really super complicated what the FED does and it's tools are limited.  No surprises. So it's by the people for the people.  Now Bitcoin is basically survival of the fittest...or wealthiest.. It's controlled only by who has more of it..the wealthy basically.  So centralized is controlled by the people. Bitcoin is controlled by the wealthy.  If I'm wrong please explain.
