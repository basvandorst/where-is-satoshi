Argument 1: Bitcoin mining is a natural monopoly (due to economies of scale) therefore it will result in a monopoly. 
- Half True. It could be a natural monopoly but businesses seek to maximize profit &amp; a single BTC mining monopoly would be negative for profit so the largest miners will self limit their market share. 
Argument 2: An inferior product can not survive (as evidenced by BTC’s falling market share) 
1. BTC’s market share needs to be compared to other currencies not platforms or applications which not only do not threaten BTC but actually add value to BTC, due to BTC being the reserve currency for the ecosystem. (As evidenced by BTC price growth to all time highs while overall market share declining.) 
2. Money is different to a ‘product’ in that trust plays a big role, so a new improved money cannot easily surpass the old trusted one. It’s not impossible but the improvements/efficiencies have to be extremely compelling. LN allows for transactions so fast and cheap that even an instant, free currency competitor may not be compelling enough to displace BTC.

There are also transaction fees, the more you pay, the quicker your transaction is likely to be processed. As the mining reward is reduced the transaction fees will start to make up a larger % of the incentive.

Yes. I agree Hodlers are good for price! But what I’m saying is that the media would have you believe people are panicking losing faith and selling but the reality is hodling gets stronger in BTC bear markets, I’m just trying to find an up to date graph so I can see just how much we’re hodling and how little there is in circulation

A fairly large part. Because it’s been shown using hodl waves that less and less BTC is circulated over time in a bear market, as of 31/10, only 17% of BTC had moved in the last 3 months (vs. 40% at height of bull) so the futures, shorters and sellers are working with a pool of &lt;$10 Billon BTC. Given there is probably $2.5 Billion in stablecoins they are going to be caught with their pants down when sentiment changes and everyone is chasing those few circulating BTC

Disagree, look at hodl waves, in bear market, people just hodl tighter. &lt;17% of BTC moved in last 3 months. The amount of BTC circulating gets so small that the price easily leaps again on fairly low demand because they’re chasing so few BTC. (Unlike other situations where paper markets can control physical goods, BTC being digital is harder to manipulate too long in that way.)
