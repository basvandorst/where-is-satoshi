I meant a lot of people here are saying there's no volatility in the stock market in general, so traders are looking for anything they can get with volatility, because volatility=higher potential profits, apparently, and volatility=higher potential profits is kinda true but meh, and there's a point where volatility is too high, ie bitcoin.....
it's ignorant. like you say, btc is *incredibly* volatile compared to forex, with not much as far as indicators for where it will go

??? Today? Wildly so, yes. It's pure fantasy to think otherwise.


You're implying current Wall Street fraud significantly affects the backing of the USD. It doesn't compared to many other things. Things like political games over our debt ceiling do.


Yes, if you're comparing those two things. People who frequent cryptocurrency social communities on the Internet might not, but the average American certainly will. The average American doesn't even get the concept that the USD only has value because people say it does. They just think it has value. Also, that's a bold assumption to make about Bitcoin rising if we enter another crisis. You can't predict it, and certainly can't declare it without being foolish...


Again, kind of right, but really off in a fundamental sense, and the nuance is drastically important.


I mean, if you want to misconstrue things yeah. They paid back the TARP loans with interest, which were designed strictly to keep banks open and to keep them lending. It was part of drastic and experimental measures taken by the Federal Reserve to avoid complete global economic collapse.
They were given taxpayer money on the understanding that they would continue to lend. If they stopped lending, spending would stop, and the economy would freeze. They had to keep lending. I guess they could have lent at 0%? But the whole point of the loan was to keep things working like normal as well as possible. Then when the ship wasn't an inch from capsizing we could look at regulatory reform.
They "took taxpayer money" to continue lending and keep the economy functioning. Then they paid that money back with interest.


That wasn't corrupt, and that has nothing to do with the dollar itself. And if bitcoin is used as a currency, it's just as open to that kind of corruption. All it is fundamentally is a transfer of value or wealth. A representation of wealth and a tool.


You're again ignorant if you think politicians, at least ones who deal at all with fiscal or monetary policy affecting the USD, do it for money. They'd make much more elsewhere. The dollar isn't declining, at least not in any way that you're implying.


Misleading af lol. Inflation, oh no, something most economists agree is a good thing for a central currency to have in small amounts over time. You get that's literally an inflation chart right? And that most people would want their currency to slowly inflate? And that current institutions and governments are set up to work under the premise of modest inflation? We left the gold standard for a reason, and most people not named Ron Paul are happy about that.

If you want to talk strictly about commercial or retail banks yeah.


Pretty much. Awesome right? A massive aspect of strong economic growth!


Are you suggesting we should abandon fractional reserve banking? Because that's how your comment reads, and is absurd...
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:49:36
you're uninformed so you go to complain to people who will agree with you, jesus
the literal tweet and its premise are all so off
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:17:14
You're so ignorant. Read a textbook or a news article, or hell a wikipedia page on something relevant instead of your youtube videos. You're being lied to by people who don't even realize they're full of shit.
You can't think bitcoin will upend the current financial system if you don't even understand the system or how it works.
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:13:17
This is a much closer analogy. Not perfect but much better at least.
It's not like bitcoin threatens and bank. Banks can start *using* bitcoin or offering bitcoin if they really wanted to, at least if regulators didn't say no. As it is, bitcoin is already being used as an investment vehicle and banks will buy in (probably have already) if they think it's safe and profitable. You can call something stupid for good reasons without being biased or whatever the fuck. It'd be stupid AF to buy Tesla calls at $500 expiring in three months. That doesn't mean I don't own Tesla stock.
He just thinks bitcoin is dumb, won't replace currency on a large scale, and is risky af to invest in. And people here are kidding themselves if they think that bitcoin is seen or will soon be seen as anything other than a commodity. And if one day it is, it's likely JP Morgan will bet on it like people bet on Forex.
This post and all the horribly ignorant and stupid comments in it show why we end up with bad economic policies.
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:42:56
I mean, you literally submitted a comment of mine as a post in this subreddit. Imo, I have a right to show up to this specific post. Don't worry, I don't comment in this place. Sometimes I'll read, but I let it be unless it reaches As for the link you just posted, the reason we have central banks and the like is to avoid issues that arise from leaving a currency or economy to its own devices. Hoover gets quoted a lot for saying "We have gold because we cannot trust governments." He's remembered as one of our worst presidents because he intentionally avoided any intervention in the face of economic crisis.
And what's this hate on fractional reserve lending? I've seen a few people in the thread mention it. Our economy would be tiny without it. You wouldn't be able to get loans. Businesses wouldn't be able to start. Yeah it could lead to a run on the banks, and our entire global economic system relies on the fact that people just go with it, and that's terrifying and something I try imploring to more people when we talk about the debt ceiling. The trust that debts will be paid.
But there can still be loans with bitcoin. I can still agree to pay you a bitcoin over the course of the next ten years. What makes bank loans and things like that work is diversification essentially. That a few people will default, but you factor that into your pricing. A lot of the problems talked about here can still exist with bitcoin and are inherent to the transfer of wealth and value itself...

Bitcoin only has value because people think it does. What's to stop the US from adopting it as its official currency, having MASSIVE influence over the value of bitcoin, and fucking everything up the same way?
What's to prevent Bitcoin from losing all value tomorrow if the notion that it's in a bubble reaches a critical point, and people start pulling out until it's sitting back where it was 8 years ago?
There's nothing inherently safe about bitcoin from a value standpoint, which is the whole point here. People believe gold has inherent value. I think it's a stretch, but it's an even further stretch to say that bitcoin has inherent value. It has value because people believe in it, and really its real-world, not theoretical, value is almost certainly what it is today out of pure investment of people hoping to make money.
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:21:21


no sorry. I get the concept, and in theory it's a compelling one, and who knows, there's probably some universe where it REALLY takes off. And there will always be a value to owning something like bitcoin, but something like the USD is backed officially by the full faith and credit of the United States Treasury... and less officially, by the *historical* strength of the US economy, by the strength of our political system, by our military if you really want to go that far. It's backed by the "fact" that the USD will always be valuable, at LEAST relatively. If the world goes to shit and countries start to fail, it's a safe bet to say the US will be one of the last to fail. Maybe it won't be, but which other country has a higher *chance*? The world has an interest in our continued strength, even something like China does. 60% of global reserve currency is in USD.


What does this even mean?


JP Morgan is not the world's largest bank. And why do people no longer need banks? Because miners will loan money on a peer-to-peer level? It doesn't work.

I mean, no. Insulting someone isn't an ad-hominem. And "Just them jerking each other off" is a euphemism to say they're doing nothing, they're doing jack shit, etc. That's literally descriptive, even if it's pretty vague. The only time an insult is an ad-hominem is when it replaces an argument. Not when it's in addendum to a valid argument. If I call you an idiot while telling you why you're wrong, or even just while continuing *my* argument, it's not an ad-hominem fallacy. You can't just go yelling "ad-hominem" at people as if it refutes the rest of their actual argument and leave it at that. People don't give a fuck if you're upset you think they broke a rule from a website you saw on reddit, when they already made their case, and you don't reply with literally anything to contribute to a discussion, argument, or debate.


He sure contributed more than you did tho ��

Lol, neat. I don't know enough to say whether I'm pro-bitcoin or not, but I think it's silly to interfere with it in a way to harm it for no reason other than disliking it, or greed, if that's what these guys have done.
I probably won't ever know enough about bitcoin for anything you've said to help me form an opinion, but if I appreciate that you care enough to make these comments :D if I ever do really dig into btc, I'll definitely remember back to them.
btc seems though to have good fundamentals, well for an almost purely speculative thing and from a too-superficial personal understanding. And good "management"... it seems made well, and the guys who designed it seem to have a real understanding of what they're doing.

you're ignorant, arrogant, and obnoxious
nice chattin with ya, maybe you'll think back to this at some point
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:07:18
I have no idea what I'm doing in this sub, but calling someone a scam artist isn't ad-hominem inherently. If they are actually a scam artist, or if there have been actual scam artists, it's not an ad-hominem. That's such a disgustingly overused term.
I mean, the guy might need to show how they're scam artists, but he's not guilty of any obnoxiouslogicalfallacywebsite.org
The only thing he's guilty of is not having a fully fleshed-out argument or comment. But it's reddit, what a shocker we're limited by time and typing speed. Tho I imagine his comment was pretty superficial because he's clearly speaking on a knowledgeable level to other people who know what he's talking about.

Not sure how this


backs up your first sentence at all. And I don't think this tweet did anything other than display a total ignorance of what JP Morgan OR other investment banks OR Bitcoin are.
He's right about the currency crackdown. And if banks aren't investing in Bitcoin, it's because they either can't do so with a high enough degree of certainty, ie they're like penny stocks, or because they don't know enough about it.
People here are going on about "uhhh well why would they not invest in bitcoin if they didn't hate bitcoin? there's no volatility in the market or chance to make money, so isn't this exactly what big banks are looking for?" Penny stocks are highly volatile. You don't see JP Morgan investing in them.

I'm wary of bitcoin as much as the next person who's slept through ap econ, but this isn't at all a ponzi scheme, and doesn't really look like one either unless you force the dots into a certain position and ignore a lot of other stuff.
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:01:14
lol, that's something of a badge of honor to be called. A guy who saved the global economy from collapse? A guy whose entire academic life was devoted to studying the Great Depression and its causes, to theorizing how it could have been prevented, a guy who became chairman of the Federal Reserve, who faced economic catastrophe that could have dwarfed the Depression, but believed in himself, his theories, and the scant evidence we had showing he was right, and who took unprecedented action to, well, save the world.
Thank you!
