Scooped it up on eBay. Seemed like a relatively well made one.

$16764 was my highest. Then learned about DCA and started in March 2018. DCA’d all the way to the beginning of this runup from $3400. Haven’t put anymore in lately cause I’m happy with what I got now. My average cost is around $8000/BTC.

Mainly so you can clean the ball off to putt. Sometimes there is mud and debris on the ball.

Hopefully I can stir up some interest and educate some people.

No. I’ve bought and sold enough on Coinbase that I’m sure my info has been sent to the IRS. I tax loss harvested my losses. I got the bitcoin bug in the 2017 run up, sold at 3500, tax loss harvested and then rebought back in the next day. Overall, I have lost on any trading I’ve attempted so now I’m a true HODLer. It’s too hard to time the market. If you just hold and never sell there are no taxes to report because there no losses or gains.

I sold 1/3 of my BTC at 10650 and FOMOd back in at 11800. I like to think of my self as a HODLer but was trying to do some trading using the MACD but couldn’t hack it. Never trading again.

Seed words are at my bank safety deposit box of all places. Gotta love the irony. I keep my ledger nano s in my home safety deposit box.

Actually pretty good. We need more content like this instead of memes and “technical analysis”.

What is this jibberish?

Coinbase Pro is around .15%

Actually a lot of the guys I play golf with have a big marker for marking their ball when it’s not in the way of another ball and then a separate flatter marker for when it is in the way.

I’m at 3% of my net worth in BTC.

I started dollar cost averaging during the peak of 2017 until now. My average cost is $7500ish.

I got hooked in 2017 during the 20k climb. Dollar cost averaged all the way up and all the way down and now have a position that I’m happy with, without having to invest anymore. My overall cost through it all is $7500/BTC. So I’m up like 50%.

Actually there already is!  Lol
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:21:44
I agree. Too many memes. Maybe we should create a subreddit called bitcoinmemes?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:02:54
Don’t forget about taxes! Better to HODL.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:08:35
