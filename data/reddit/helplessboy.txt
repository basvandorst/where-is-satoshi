cringiest thing i've seen this week
@_date: 2014-09-07 06:25:19
lol @ ppl that think the email protocol is good
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:52:01
Wow. Average person doesn't wanna try to understand all that, sorry bucko. Paypal is instant.
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:20:20
Seriously. A "maybe" is front page news that means "THEY'RE INTERESTED!" for these guys. Of course they can't tell it's a "maybe, go away", because autism.
@_date: 2014-09-07 00:11:15
They are not post scarcity but they are post "accusation of wealth." They have decided there are more important things to think about.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:14:31
Case in point.
1. Can't take a joke 
2. Can't provide legit discussion 
It's the exact same as a religious person. This person has a blinded, delusional, illogical allegiance to a particular thing, and constantly complains about people who "hate" on it (or just point out the obvious negative aspects). 
Now please excuse me while insert my fiat-backed credit card into your dog's butthole.
(I guarantee the reply will be complaining about my crass humor, claiming I'm too dumb to discuss bitcoin with, or otherwise avoiding the actual topic of discussion)
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:08:39
On this day many lolz were had, and many butt worshipers were mad
@_date: 2014-12-15 00:49:44
yeah, yeah it does mean that. sorry ;) maybe next life if you're less gullible and don't represent internet tokens hahaha
good luck with everything
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:44:30
So anyways, how do you think Bitcoin will overcome the hour long transaction confirmations that are built into its protocol?
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:50:10
if you're not going to converse with me (letting me know i made some good points that you can't refute), i'm going to delete my comments since they'll only be censored and deleted by mods in thirty seconds anyways. hello mod. enjoying life? lol @ u
@_date: 2014-09-22 02:22:24
Dude but I don't give a flying fuck if they take 3 percent or 4 percent, I want to spend my life thinking about and making art, not thinking about which type of money will save me half a percent
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:05:31
so if i want to use bitcoins dont carry my phone? i need my phone in public
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:02:48
The irony.
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:06:49
oh fuck i never knew LOL 
@_date: 2014-09-07 00:05:27
More people know about Star Trek than Bitcoin. Which is more real again?
@_date: 2014-09-22 07:17:15
lol ok, so i just need to buy this thing called a trezor, or buy an android phone and buy a special wallet for it, then figure out how to setup and use multi-passphrase encryption.  sounds like a real great use of a weekend.  i'll stick to my credit card thanks
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:15:03
oh my god that made me cringe so hard. lady's like "it's a very ADAMANT position, roger" aka stfu socially awkward weirdo talking nonsense. "most important invention in the history of the world since the internet" - roger ver "protected by the laws of mathematics not the laws of men" - roger ver "...they can send and receive money
you're not trolling, right? that would really ruin my lolz.
you don't convert any btc from your store to real world dollars. yet you buy clothes and pay bills mysteriously... must be another income... in USD
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:27:17
Lol you just deleted another one of your dumb comebacks, probably because you were embarrassed at home dumb it was. 
Don't worry, I've got it here. It says "Dwave has nothing to do with the research I posted, dumbass. Try again."
To that, I say:

@_date: 2014-12-22 04:46:01
Chargeback are a good thing... They're an advanced feature... If you don't like chargebacks you could go back to the Stone Age. 
I love how butters act like there are fraudulent chargebacks all the time or something... Chargebacks solve many more crimes than they commit. I feel like I'm explaining money to my 10 year old or something.
If you *really* don't like chargebacks then fine, maybe you should be able to disable them for specific situations but it should at least be an option, especially for a currency you nutters are trying to push as the most technologically advanced currency of all time. Just lol.
@_date: 2014-09-10 00:49:45
haha cool
@_date: 2014-09-07 03:06:02
please expand on 1.
@_date: 2014-12-15 00:59:43
Um yeah, that would work! So it's a very good thing I don't go around suggesting people put money into my circlejerk! Unlike you, and yours :D 
Ouch... that's the sound of backfire...
Dinner time, courtesy of my CC, tootaloo! *slight fedora tip*
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:07:10
but i thought one of the main advantages of bitcoins was that it can't be destroyed or lost in the real world like cash?
@_date: 2014-09-08 05:12:54
there has to be fear.... ok not something i want to be part of thanks
@_date: 2014-09-23 03:58:14
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:23:16
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:53:02
Yeah, or like in here! Am I right? Or like *high five* Pretty hilarious, though.
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:46:49
Really? Haha. If you're just going to bitcoin me at least be blockchain. That changetip and this one are the only two satoshis I've ever posted in moron :)
@_date: 2014-09-22 08:38:53
Visa of bitcoin is needed and will happen in the future, but it's just reinventing the wheel. my basic point is that bitcoin is money and faces the same amount of problems as fiat. difference is it's in its infant stages and so it's not as advanced as our fiat services
@_date: 2014-09-07 01:16:07
Mind blowing, much wisdom, so insight
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:48:58
Bitcoin would be a specific type of water, like Aquafina. 
Crytpocurrency is water. You can't hate on cryptocurrency or water, they're just things.
Bitcoin/Aquafina are specific types of these categories. It's totally okay to dislike them.
@_date: 2014-09-07 00:04:19
Yeah Linux has its place. And we don't live in the era of Star Trek, but the goal is to push forward and live futuristically.
As to the Linux, I was speaking about people that say Linux is the best OS to use on a personal computer. It's not for the mainstream. Bitcoin has its place too, but not in the mainstream, much like Linux.
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:51:32
but then i can't spend them unless i have them on my person... in which case someone could steal them
whereas i could have my credit card, and have all the money i want, and at the same time be protected from theft...
@_date: 2014-12-21 04:11:07
@_date: 2014-09-07 21:19:46
*cringe* cool, one of those guys that talks like a thesaurus and unnecessarily spews out words he thinks makes him sound smart. as an added bonus, it appears you're a grammar nazi. yeah, i'm the moron, you're not a social moron at all (but on a serious note, thank you for the laughs as i browse your cringe filled post history, you're amazing *tips fedora*)
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:16:00
I'm not a genius of science like u: 
How embarrassing. At least when I say stupid things, I'm genuinely trying to look stupid. Something you stupid people can't comprehend. Maybe because you're stuck in one of your alternate universes. I'm sure bitcoin is the chosen currency there! *slaps you in the face with my wallet, spits on your stupid, balding head, disrespects your mother*
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:28:39
you're a dumbass. bitcoin did not come out with those things, they've been in whitepapers for a decade before bitcoin was conceived

It's because the community is made up of individuals that share some particular personality traits. These personality traits lend well to being trolled.
-- Eager to attain material objects (money/bitcoin)
-- Easily agitated, emotional
-- Willing to enter and fully immense self in confrontation via keyboard
-- Has average intelligence while assuming/thinking/acting as if he/she is above-average
-- Arrogant
-- Gullible
-- Obsessive
-- Unable to see "the bigger picture"
Apologies on the last point being a very vague description, but I can't really think of a better way to put it.
@_date: 2014-09-22 03:11:09
yeah... but have fun being proud of your phone's cryptography while you're dead from some thug's gunshot

Holy fuck, you are one pathetic sack of shit. An *entire account* of nothing but whining about people who whine about Bitcoin. What the fuck is wrong with you?
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:06:52
it's not really to be expected of "the media" to understand the complex intricacies of an obscure crypto-currency that is breaking down with more and more holes as people realize the pyramid scheme
its YOUR job as the fanatic to make this stupid thing accessible and understandable, as well as attractive to outsiders if you want to market it.
even after spending a lot of time here, most people are still confused and don't understand some of the most basic things about bitcoin. that's one of the reasons that it's mediocre. apologies for the blunt truth that may rustle jimmies
@_date: 2014-09-22 11:09:54
wow thats really alpha of you and everything, but i was posing this as a general question of what would happen if an average crook held up an average bitcoin user. i'm not actually a crook, but that's really neat that you're actually tough 
@_date: 2014-12-21 23:35:08
Probably because he's a rational human that would rather keep the same money as real money?
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:27:05
Not real money. Unless I can spend it like real money. Too bad it takes a minimum of 10 minutes to use, unlike real money which is instant.
@_date: 2014-09-22 08:29:28
should have mentioned my post is in response to a bitcoiner saying "When you use paper money or its digital representation, you are backing the current world elite and the status quo, supporting the lovely oil industry and military industrial complex that the modern 1st-world economy rests on."
given the choice of funding slavery or oil, i choose oil
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:29:08
You actually make some sense. I mean if the world were full of robots and 100% logical beings, everything would be fine.. Unfortunately there are different cultures, personalities, and various human complications in the outside world. I know it's hard to break through the binary way of thinking of a libertarian, but trust me, you just might mature one day. Until then, you and Roger Ver can keep typing libertarian essays on how the world SHOULD work on random message boards. I'll keep doing my thing, laughing along the way.
@_date: 2014-09-22 09:34:55
i did, but i wanted to see what the fedoras here would say, and sure enough i got some great angry responses
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:19:15
the things you say are stupid, you don't have sources for your information, your "you don't know these things but i know these things" attitude is immature, you come off as very defensive letting me know i've won the argument, and i'm ending this conversation before your retardation rubs off on me.
@_date: 2014-09-07 05:07:52
nice, so clever, what a response, 10/10 will read to grandchildren
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:09:25
Guy explains how tough he would be in a hypothetical robbery
Robbery actually happens, guy doesn't execute badass skill he previously bragged about
How is that not funny? No one was hurt, no real harm done. Just some justice served upon a keyboard warrior

you should, to add even more humor to it. the grammar is laughable

@_date: 2014-12-15 07:21:26
Honestly why do you take the time to complain? That's a lot more pathetic than "trolling" 
Fedora face.
@_date: 2014-09-07 21:28:06
never touched drugs. very mature of you to accuse a stranger on the internet. so sorry for my misspellings, lol @ people like you that take the time to whine and complain about grammar online. get a life goober
@_date: 2014-12-13 19:23:17
here--this might help! :) changetip u/automorph $50
now just get a wallet and you can download the money. get yourself a new video game on me! ;)
@_date: 2014-09-21 21:06:00
also if i steal your credit card i might be able to charge a few thousand dollars most, but then that transaction will be reversed anyways when you call the credit card company.
if i steal your bitcoin wallet, you're totally fucked.
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:33:18
Awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:09:16
HOLY FUCK THIS IS HILARIOUS
@_date: 2014-12-14 19:04:54
Woah, can anyone explain what just happened here? So confused. Is money? Can tip me? Not trying to get tipped or anything, just curious what happened here and how it works. Not looking for tips. Thanks. Woah
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:10:22
wow, what a mistake! could sell them for almost 500 each right now before the bubble slides even further. oh well.
@_date: 2014-09-07 00:07:08
Thanks for proving my point :) the species that uses Latinum, the Ferengi, are known for their greed, materialism, and old way of thinking.
@_date: 2014-12-15 00:39:45
just...not funny. smh.
@_date: 2014-09-07 00:10:36
Yeah, the average person in the world with little interest in operating systems would be better off figuring out how to use Linux rather than using an iPad.
Also would be better off canceling their bank accounts and relying on bitcoin. Not.

You're 2 smart 4 me, teach me how 2 bitcoin invest for money how to libertarian?
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:37:59
I'm trying to look smart and you caught me looking dumb! Argh, I hate it when that happens. My grammar, spelling, capitalization, and maturity are all wrong. I give up, you totally win!
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:05:06
but aren't your bitcoins accessible with an internet connection? not just locally on the phone? 
@_date: 2014-09-08 03:10:39
this is one big reason why bitcoin is retarded. this happens every day. sorry tin foilers
@_date: 2014-09-22 08:27:07
@_date: 2014-09-22 03:05:21
but bitgo could pull an mtgox and isn't protected by the government like visa
@_date: 2014-09-09 20:11:47
you, you're a dumbass proclaiming that bitcoin is great and innovative. it's fine, it's the netscape browser of today, exciting for nerds and a big bubble for a few years but will be surpassed.
@_date: 2014-12-20 07:04:33
LOL! I didn't even notice my username XD 
@_date: 2014-09-22 07:42:15
macbook, umad? but this is in response to a buttcoiner telling me he won't use dollars because it supports oil companies. i'm here to point out bitcoin has blood shed too
@_date: 2014-12-21 00:25:27
LOL! No YOU don't notice much XDDD *poke*
@_date: 2014-09-22 03:04:24
i would take your phone and spend time trying to get your bitcoins. or everything else. besides 99% of people would submit to the threat. obviously. so can you not be stupid for one sec and realize what i'm saying is a valid reason why visa &gt; bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:27:55
maybe the person on the beach could be mark karpeles?
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:00:38
Hi, you're a colossal idiot. I was hoping this could be sort of like a mini AMA. What's it like being put in the same category as Mark Karpeles and Roger Ver in the minds of the masses?

"wearing my moderator hat" *cringe* is that a fedora?
@_date: 2014-09-22 08:22:59
I want to find an easy solution, a bitcoin version of visa. multi sig blah blah is not an EASY solution and requires me purchasing stuff. I want something easy and safe.
@_date: 2014-09-24 03:49:00
We have a badass over here
@_date: 2014-09-22 02:53:32
stupid. then you die and nothing matters (for you). you would obviously give me the bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:49:26
wow amazing fact! oh wait, this is common sense and obvious. thanks for that!
no but really. this is a great deal, and something us average fiat users don't have to think about. it's all taken care of for us. some bitcoiners want to create new versions of insurance for bitcoins... its all re-inventing the wheel. 
tldr bitcoin is pretty silly
@_date: 2014-09-10 00:59:58
shaking my head in disbelief. the personality of bitcoiners is so entertaining, especially because it's so consistent. just leave me alone, fedora face
@_date: 2014-12-21 00:51:59
Exactly, Reddit must have seen the Bitcoin slope curving downward but still realizes the benefit of crypto currencies in general. People like will always think we're "trolling" even when we write logical, informed opinions, just because we don't vouch Bitcoin (very ironic when someone shares a real opinion backed by evidence, and he responds with nothing of value and just whines "Ur TRoLlinGG!!!")
Sorry that Bitcoin isn't the holy, one true version of crypto currency. It's not "trolling" to say that Bitcoin is headed downward, it's just looking at the available data and reporting said findings.
Anyways, if you see the angry, pro-bitcoin posts in Reddit notes threads, it's pretty much like seeing a debate between people of different religions. From an outside perspective it's clear that all cryptos have different uses and different lifespans. It will be interesting to see what will happen with notes.
without getting too emotional, I'd be interested to know your opinion about the future of Bitcoin, notes, and other cryptos/altcoins. I am guessing you predict the price of Bitcoin to increase over the next few years? All other altcoins will fail? Do you think notes will fail? 
@_date: 2014-12-21 08:04:02
Do you recommend people pull their funds out of Coinbase?
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:51:19
Also, your logic should be reversed. The only reason trolls even exist is because the bitcoin community is pushing hard, trying to push this silly thing on the world.
If the product was any good, you wouldn't have to advertise it.
No one advertises "cryptocurrency" as a whole because it doesn't need to be advertised. It's a cool, helpful phenomenon. It's a category of things that are useful. Different types are useful for different things. Many different crypto technologies have different positive and negative aspects.
Bitcoin, however, is a particular THING that people try to advertise because it's not inherently more useful than competing products.
I am cryptocurrency agnostic. You all are crazy religious people. You are members of a fraternity. You are brand fanatics. Do you look down upon people who so proudly show off their Apple products? How hypocritical of you in that bitcoin t-shirt.
@_date: 2014-09-09 05:33:48
no innovation from visa except super advanced automated anti fraud protection that protects thousands of people from scammers every day
@_date: 2014-12-21 08:20:42
This "fee sniping"... Does that imply Coinbase's profits from trading fees are at risk?
If I understand correctly, actual user funds are not at risk with this vulnerability? That's good but I'm still too scared to keep anything in Coinbase now.
I know paper wallets and usb keys are options, but I would hope there is a way to store internet money on the internet. Is there a safe method or online service you can recommend? Thanks for your time!
edit: Just saw where you wrote that this is a compatibility issue, not a security risk. That answers my first question!
@_date: 2014-09-22 03:40:45
yes people do get held up at ATMs, quite often. The maximum amount ATMs allow a person to withdraw is a few hundred dollars however. All of your "what-ifs" are small-chance scenarios, and when thinking about the criminal's logic, remember this is a stupid person possibly intoxicated not thinking logically at all but very willing to kill you.
@_date: 2014-09-22 08:28:14
