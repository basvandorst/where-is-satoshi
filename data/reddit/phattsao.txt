There are multiple drug-related murders every day in New York State, but "Gary Alford" and the "New York State Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force" would rather go after a couple of white collar guys who bought weed on the internet.  Fucking great use of tax money there.

If you didn't get out of Mt. Gox the second they got their accounts frozen in March, you're an idiot

This guy was definitely buying drugs, but maybe not weed, which is why he's so latched onto the "I haven't smoked weed since high school".  But how bout all that coke?

It's easy.  No bank account needed.  Walk into a CVS and use moneygram.
It's CONFUSING until you wrap your head around it, but it ain't hard.  Frankly, though, the confusion is good for people using it for "illicit" transactions.  The tech barrier is keeping the average idiots from jumping on the silk road and getting it massive publicity.  
@_date: 2012-10-26 13:15:02
I'm a little worried myself.  I sent an email to bitinstant, if I hear anything I'll post it here.  
@_date: 2012-10-30 16:52:31
This is a good question, no one seems to have addressed it.  I had to go through MT. Gox because I got tired of waiting...
@_date: 2012-10-26 16:37:26
They said "We're down for site revisions, we'll be back up on Monday".  
EDIT:  Bitinstant seems to be back up, but the option to "send to a bitcoin address" is not available..
@_date: 2013-05-30 14:36:36
Nice, now I have to wait 2 weeks or whatever because these idiots lied on an application
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:54:09
You and other people are morons, and the problems are likely your own fault.  I'm guessing fake names/addresses.

There are already multiple other TOR sites up and doing business.  The FBI has accomplished nothing except motivating the online drug industry to try a little harder.  Great waste of money and resources during a government shutdown!

After they denied it, tried to hush it up, and refused to name the person, they cave 2 months later?

It's pretty interesting how you haven't "processed" my order yet zipzap reports that you have received the money.  I'm curious what is happening that makes these things have to be "processed manually".

@_date: 2013-10-22 16:40:45
My guess as to what happened:
Mt. Gox got an account seized by the US Government, so Bitinstant went into panic mode.  Likely they didn't have the proper licenses and permits to do what they were doing, so they pulled the plug.  
In addition, they had just rolled out a broken-ass, untested new site that screwed a lot of people.  I know they had my money locked up for a week, and I decided never to use them again.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:54:01
I bought nothing and made $100 since the value of coins went up.  Buying random crap with bitcoins right now is a good way to lose money.  
@_date: 2013-08-17 13:41:01
Supermassive fail.  Research things before you give them money.  
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:55:15
I'm guessing this all has something to do with $40 bitcoins and the such, wonder what's going on.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:37:14

so Mt. Gox is pretty much done then?
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:49:52
Bitinstant has never failed me for the past 6 months or so.  
Every problem I've read about it on reddit has left me with the distinct impression that the complainer is a moron.  People trying to get into bitcoin can't figure it out, fuck it up, and then blame bitinstant.
For example, I literally just finished a moneygram at CVS for bitinstant.  My phone beeped with the confirmation email before I even left the store.
Long story short, idiots are doing it wrong.  
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:46:57
A good moral here:  Never listen to a fucking 15 year old
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:07:41
Do cash directly to your own MtGox account.  You're using the absolute easiest way of buying bitcoins, did you not expect a fee?
@_date: 2013-10-15 13:34:22
Yeah, thanks for fucking us up the ass coinbase.
Basically, if you have a mastercard, fuck you.  
Made a purchase before noticing this, now I get to wait a week.  
As soon as I find a better way to buy coins, I'll drop coinbase like I did bitinstant.  Stop making arbitrary changes that fuck everything up.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:14:17
This is true of all reddit subs, honestly. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 11:11:24
a bitinstant service that works
@_date: 2013-06-12 11:03:14
Nope, they're up to the old "disappearing money" trick again.  I did a simple cash to Mt. Gox 14 hours ago and haven't gotten the money.  They just tell you to go to their support page where they give you a copy pasted response.  
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:07:10
Not according to the zipzap reciept.  Likely you got coins sent straight to a bitcoin address, not Mt. Gox
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:34:29
The other 500 people posting here about this same problem
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:47:12
NEVER HAD A SINGLE PROBLEM WITH BITINSTANT after around 20 transactions.  So what am I doing that you people aren't?
Wild guess, you guys are using fake names/numbers/emails and it's screwing it up.  
Second, if you are doing it straight to your wallet, you're doing it wrong.  If you are so worried about giving Mt. Gox your info, you shouldn't be buying bitcoins anyway.  
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:33:51
We logged our issues yesterday.  Please address them.

TLDR:  Finger-banged 15 year old girl, blew a load on her, got kicked out of house.  Used bitcoins to get home.  
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:48:47
Don't think so.  I still see stupid stoner teenagers bitching.  If this is too complicated, don't buy bitcoins.

I think it's safe to say SR is what has kept bitcoin alive so far, and I hope it continues to do it despite all these fucking bankers trying to make money.

False alarm, it sent it to the correct address it seems.  I don't know if that was some kind of re-routing or what.

You have to go to support and enter a ticket with them.  Same thing happened to me, paid tuesday, got my BTC on Sunday after many emails to support.

It's not really bullshit, just a factual observation
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:57:36
Yeah, nice of them to make this mandatory for instant purchases.  After 10+ instant transactions I now have to wait a week because these assholes won't take mastercard.  
@_date: 2013-03-08 18:33:54
Sounds like you went about this in the worst possible way
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:33:35
I don't think you understand how bitinstant works, or you wouldn't be crying about something that is plainly obvious.
@_date: 2013-06-13 11:10:19
36 hours later and nothing.  At what point does this become fraud?
@_date: 2013-07-12 16:08:03
Yeah, I bet they suddenly wish they hadn't been shit the last couple months
@_date: 2013-03-07 19:28:25
For what it's worth, I did one on Tuesday, moneygram to Mt. Gox, worked great once the site was actually up.  
They do seem to require more verification now; they won't accept mailnator addresses, they require your full name and phone number.

Thanks, I will be sure to look for it.  I've emailed customer service twice so far, they're giving me the impression that they won't look into it until it's been 48 hours.  
@_date: 2013-08-19 16:20:05
Bitinstant had the market cornered for a while, but got lazy, they deserve the impending doom.
