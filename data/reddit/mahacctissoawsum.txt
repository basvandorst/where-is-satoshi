I did some digging and found that it's only using 10 iterations of PBKDF2.
It should be increased to the point where it's "slow" again, and updated periodically as computers get faster, such that it really doesn't matter how fast your machine is.

Which desktop client do you recommend (for Windows)? Bitcoin-Qt has pretty much 0 options and doesn't tell me anything about the wallet it's automatically generated for me either. I want all the technical details.

1.5% transfer fee is pretty steep...

I've got 16 GB... is it a resource hog?

That's fair enough. BlockChain looked like a professional, well-designed site... I thought they might be securing my info better than they actually are. But if they're crap, I'll put my wallet elsewhere... I'm new to BTC and just trying to decide the best way to manage everything.

Huh....? Keep them in separate wallets so you can transfer them into a single wallet so that you can actually spend them...?

Wait..what? I thought my password was used to decrypt the actual key?
Are you saying my bitcoin addresses are based on my password?

I've been watching it for the past few days....if you timed it right, you could make 40% in about an hour, even at these ridiculous prices.

the hell is Linden $?

But if you remove all the addresses containing money, what would stop you from screwing walletrecoveryservices.com and not paying them for cracking your account? 
I suppose they would just notify you that they've cracked your password, and ask for some funds before handing it over? But then you have to trust them again.
And how would they be able to calculate the 10 or 20% fee without knowing how much was in there?
