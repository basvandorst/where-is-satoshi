Then make a rating depending on a number of bad reviews, but tell the public that it's rated on the positive reviews :/

I see it more in line of people using it to cut transaction fees. Using Bitcoin for buying bread at the local store isn't viable due to transaction costing more than the value of the bread, this is if the Bitcoin becomes a primary currency with every person using it. Also the wait time needs to be in a matter of seconds.

All money is backed up by faith. If people lose faith that dolar, euro or bitcoin have value then they don't have value. Your belief that a currency has value and that others also believe that allow that currency to be used as a means of payment. Being backed by a government means that it will be enforced and stable with minimal deviation in value. When inflation spikes government goes through changes due to revolts.

Sure it can, banks don't create money as in printing money, only the central can do that. Banks create fictual money that isn't money and that won't change. Even with Bitcoin they can do the shit they did. People will still use banks even if Bitcoin was accepted as a mainstream currency due to people wanting to get loans for whatever purposes, due to people not wanting to maneage their wealth, etc. Only regulations and will to follow them and enforce them can give us a healthy economy.

The term "backed by" fits but it's levels more complex than the simplification I wrote. 


There's nothing wrong with having paper money with no backing. Problem is with corruption that happens in financial market and institutions not doing their jobs. For instance who rates the rating agencies? 2008 was caused by banks giving out loans to everyone, rating agencies rating those loans AAA and selling those loans to investors who believed those loans are rock solid and won't default in a large scale. Again I simplify but my point is that the problem isn't currency but regulations for people dealing with that currency.

Yea that was what I was implying. I don't think Bitcoin will stop that even though supply is limited simply because they will use something to represent Bitcoin and Bitcoin will eventually become the new gold.

But that doesn't tie in with crypto. It only makes people know who is at fault and make them more aware when choosing for who to vote.
