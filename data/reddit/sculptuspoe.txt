Perhaps I don't know how a wallet works, but if you are banned does that mean they have effectively stolen any bitcoins you were keeping in their wallet?

Phish got started in 1983, ALL got together in 1987. So All is an American band after Phish.

Some other guy just sent half a million dollars to the wrong address with no idea if he will be able to get it back.

Drivel like this is the only thing stopping me from caring about bitcoin. (I donated my 5$ using the regular sort of imaginary money using PayPal.)

well... if the current trough hits below 5k-ish then it is calling the BTC general upward curve into question. At any rate I would wager that another temporary spike will bring it at least above the current value within a few months.

I did wonder about that. I haven't bought any through them yet though I was leaning in their direction. (EDIT) I looked it up in Robinhood's help center and they say :

The scarcity of gold vs. the number of uses for which it is ideal will always keep gold "valuable". The intrinsic value of gold is more or less the same while it's monetary value fluctuates. 
The bitcoin has no intrinsic value and only a monetary value. You cannot do anything with a bitcoin other than use it as money.

My contradiction was not direct and not a complete contradiction. 
The point I was making is that the intrinsic value of gold can not be neglected in respect to its monetary value. The reason gold is used as  money is that it has a high value even if there were no monetary system. It may not be as high as it is now, but supposing suddenly everybody had free use of the world's gold supply for utility purposes divorced of its monetary value, we would soon run out of gold. Perhaps making gold even more valuable.
This may soon happen to helium, whose value has been divorced from its price. 
Perhaps Bitcoin should run on the Helium standard...
