Hopefully they don't take a leaf out of BFL's book for shipping estimates

If i could spend my BTC on there site and ship to the UK i'd buy some sheets too.

@_date: 2013-11-22 22:33:46
So Amazon credits then
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:31:11
No need at all to post you're wallet ID, if you want to buy bitcoins in the UK use  (have used before and they are great, just a high mark up) or  where you can buy direct online or meet someone for a cash exchange
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:56:59
That's correct, buy what you can afford. for example 0.1 btc etc
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:05:42
That's what i wish i had, currently sitting here with 0.5!

Use something like electrum that doesn't download the blockchain, your wallet will be under 1mb
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:42:17
Maybe that is the closest.. i live in London in the UK and there is a fair few cash trades local to me. You can also do wire transfer trades on localbitcoins and people gain reputation so you can see there past trade history for some confidence.

lag on mtgox
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:24:24
It's always been behind, plus the site is closed for trading until friday so we should disregard coinbase for now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:47:40
We know
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:44:05
My bad, obviously other things on my mind.
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:44:12
Way to expensive. I just bought a load for NYE from 
 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:32:35
Indeed, they just sell overpriced junk
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:46:21
I'm enjoying watching the charts and some of the big trades happening nevertheless 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:39:56
The market would lose confidence as they seem to be big advocates. 
Edit: spelling.

I think it'll work out for you nicely.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:29:00
pretty rad electronic economy values
I just made that up.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:44:58
Depends on the reason they sold to be honest, I highly doubt they would though.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:42:41
I'm calling bullshit, elaborate lie gone to far.

Welcome to reddit

Not if PayPal decide to suspend your account, hold your money for no given reason which they are common for doing.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:47:39
Nobody knows. 
Buy what you can only afford to loose, i bought in less than a week ago when 1 BTC was trading at $400 I thought it was too late. but they are trading at $669.33 as i type this.
It's very exciting times.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:41:19

@_date: 2013-11-26 12:19:48
Can you not use localbitcoins.com for a cash exchange in a Café or something with an adult presumably. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:50:37
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:53:44
It'll archive your wallet file, just right click copy-paste, sounds like you dragged and dropped from a network share if you only had read access to a location.
Also i would recommend putting that wallet file into a trucrypt drive, but that's another story. I'll talk you through the process tonight on Skype if you like, username is rjwlol
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:33:25
They are probably lying in a pool of there own blood in a bathtub right now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:17:15

It's currently $730 USD on MTgox and 5631.04 CYN/$924.19 on btcchina
So, shh.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:12:35
It dont think the market is going to move from 600 for a couple of days now...
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:46:29
The post was pretty original and funny, this however, is not.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:40:32
They are always bloody sold out. had to resort to  with there massive markup
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:11:00
I dont like that lady
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:12:47
$400 ! Yourself?

Litecoin prices are going crazy recently, might be worth having a punt.

Instead of netflix you should watch these videos if you haven't already.

Exactly! People just need educating on cypto
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:13:29
Take a look at  (but the site seems to be down at the moment...)
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:49:16
I don't own many, bought cheap more than likely won't buy more just watching what's happening is exciting enough for me!
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:42:16
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:43:01
 has always been fantastic, a sizeable mark-up though, but I had confirmed bitcoin in my wallet 20 minutes after payment was made.

Been lagging all day, was sitting at nearly 60 second 20 minutes ago.
Currrently: Mtgox trading engine lag: 9.48seconds
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:52:50
Put a pass phrase on it using what? 
Use something like Electrum which is encrypted by default, then encrypt the wallet.dat file again in a trucrypt file and put that file on dropbox/google drive/skydrive/me.ga some usb keys etc
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:02:36
Risky shit, good luck though

At that loss i would of waited 12-24 hours, the prices have been volatile day to day, it could drop back to sub 500 tomorrow
