Yeah man, it's a game of randomness. There's always big fluctuations, especially if the bets are relatively large.
Imagine it like a million coin flips, where the coin has a 0.5% greater chance of landing on heads rather than tails. Actually, I dunno if that's a good way to explain it.  might be better.
BTW, in total, Bitcoin casino investors profit $10k+ a day.
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:08:01
Thanks man. Glad you like it.
Primedice doesn't reveal how much profit it makes. Its house edge is slightly higher than Bustabit's (but not by much) and they have slightly less turnover. I'm guessing that their profits are pretty similar.
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:32:14
Yeah, probably a lot higher. The article uses [my stats]( as source, which includes data I scrape from casinos with public stats.
Of the data I have, bustabit is extremely popular. In fact, I'm pretty sure bustabit is the  most popular Bitcoin casino currently (in terms of turnover).
@_date: 2017-03-12 04:17:08
Most Bitcoin casinos don't seem to have licences. There are a few with shady cheap licences in countries like Costa Rica and Curacao though.
It's a very grey industry, to say the least.
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:38:10
My website [TheBitcoinStrip.com]( has a list of great provably fair Bitcoin casinos.
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:32:01
A lot of BTC casinos have crowdsourced bankrolls, meaning anyone can "invest" in it and share a portion of profits/losses.
I wrote a long blog post about it here: 
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:53:07
You can work it out based on EV. Bustabit did 48,147 BTC in bets during the month of February. Their house edge is about 1% (though it can be as low as 0.5% sometimes). 1% of 48,147 BTC leaves a +481 BTC EV. That's about half a million US dollars profit.
In reality though, the site profited only 83.6 BTC. That's because of fluctuations with variance.
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:57:54


Yeah, I meant in aggregate they make 10k/day on average. You can't make that much if you only invest $10, obviously.


Pretty much, yeah. My site crawls a lot of Bitcoin casinos every 30 minutes and scrapes statistics. Sometimes they have APIs, sometimes my crawler needs to use more complex tactics (e.g. extracting the numbers from HTML).
There's also a summary of all the stats I crawl here: 
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:27:50


That's true. Similarly, Curacao doesn't really licence casinos, but a lot of casinos still claim to be licensed in Curacao. What they really mean is that they have a business license, and have paid some company called "Caracao eGaming" about 10 grand.
The whole casino licensing business is a sham anyway. It's just a way to enforce monopolies and raise revenue for the government. I don't believe the licences serve any other purpose.


Whoa there. I wasn't *complaining* about anything. Merely stating facts.


That's not really true. The affiliate programs are pretty similar in a lot of cases, and the first casino on my homepage is provably fair, has a crowdsourced bankroll, etc. I very much prefer the newer HTML5 provably fair awesome games to the old-style boring "shady"-type SoftSwiss casinos, and I make that known in my reviews. I'll also never list a site who has a believable scam accusation (e.g. 999dice is nowhere on my site -- though you'll see 5/5 reviews for it elsewhere).
It's no secret that my site lists traditional casinos too, but unlike a lot of others I do warn people of casinos that aren't [provably fair](
Actually, I think if you compare TheBitcoinStrip to any other Bitcoin gambling review website, you'll find that mine is the most honest and unbiased. The site is more hobby than ecommerce.
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:13:34
Thanks for the explanation.


Most of the time it is.
@_date: 2016-06-22 09:24:19
[What does "provably fair" mean?](
If a casino is "provably fair", it means that the player can know for sure, with the power of mathematics, that nobody is being cheated. :-)
There are many Bitcoin casinos that do provable fairness right, but there's also a large number that still do it wrong. Sadly, most players just want to gamble and don't bother to try to understand what provable fairness means, nor verify its claims, which is probably fair enough. Despite this, I still think that provable fairness is one of the greatest developments to the online casino world and I hope that one day it becomes easier to understand and verify by everybody, and that it becomes a standard among all casinos -- not just the cryptocurrency ones.
@_date: 2016-06-26 18:49:12
If you assume the best ruleset and that the player is trained in perfect basic strategy, then it's about 0.5%. However, unless you live in Atlantic City or Las Vegas and know all the ins-and-outs of the game, the edge is probably in the range of 1.5-3%.
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:49:19
Roulette, sic bo, baccarat, dice and many others need provable fairness, which includes:
* proving that the result was authentically random
* proving that the result was predetermined
* proving that the result hasn't changed
This is why client seeds exist.
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:53:01
Over 1.5 million BTC has been wagered across Bitcoin casinos since this time last here.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:23:45
Looks great! Have you considered adding it to 
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:54:21
I'd argue against this. Casinos need provable randomness because player betting patterns exist.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:23:24
Too many crappy casinos are popping up using the same old scripts. Do something new!
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:22:19
Investing in casinos is actually a relatively safe investment, contrary to popular belief. I've made a three-figure BTC profit over the course of few years.
*Read about the risks first though!*
@_date: 2017-01-06 01:02:17
I've invested in pretty much all of the top Bitcoin casinos over the past few years, except the ones that turned out to be runners (luckily). It's a very real risk, yes, but it hasn't deterred me too much.
In October 2014, one of the largest Bitcoin dice sites, Dice.Ninja, vanished and the owner disappeared with 2,000+ BTC of player and investor funds.
@_date: 2016-06-27 05:18:09
Compare that to the edges of no-strategy games at land casinos, lol.
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:34:23
This is somewhat incorrect. You're on the right path, but this method doesn't prove that the "random string" was generated randomly.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:19:12
Very cool. For those of you who want an explanation of provably fairness, I wrote a blog post about it here: 
@_date: 2017-04-08 12:13:13
We shouldn't
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:29:58


It's not nonsense, but it's the bare minimum. The number is sourced from my website [here]( which tracks the stats of 40+ Bitcoin casinos. A lot of casinos don't publish stats, so the number doesn't include those ;)
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:56:51


It is definitely not 1%. If it were only 1%, I wouldn't waste my time. My index includes the largest (by significant margin) Bitcoin casinos, including bustabit, Primedice, SatoshiDice, Crypto-Games, every game on Moneypot, etc. The sample size is large enough to be able to identify significant trends.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:27:37
Unfortunately those are some of its biggest markets. Good and bad at the same time.

Profit and revenue are definitely *not* the same thing. You're either deeply delusional or you're high.
Now you're talking about sportsbooks again. And BTC is "incredibly cheap" (lol) because of worldwide gambling turnover somehow? You've lost the plot.
Having been in the Bitcoin gambling space for years, I can say for certain that you're either very high or you just have no clue what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:53:57

Try reading past the headline, bud
Got any sources to back up your "other bitcoin gambling" (whatever that is) vs provably fair gambling claims? Probably time to put the meth pipe to rest and catch some zzz's
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:32:43
There's always some labour involved in getting anything for free. These methods are free in the sense that they a) don't require any money to start; and b) only take a few seconds to an hour or so out of your day.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:51:22


Yeah I know, but they're a completely different realm. Provably fair gambling is its own thing, and has a huge community behind it. My site is about provably fair gambling (though it does index a few that do both) and that's also what the article was about. IMO, provably fair gambling will overtake traditional online casinos [eventually]( but not for a long time.
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:34:55
There's always some *labour* involved in getting anything for free. These methods don't require much, and they definitely don't require any starting capital. :-)
@_date: 2017-04-08 14:38:03


360K / month *profit*, [not revenue]( Turnover is in the hundreds of $US millions.

@_date: 2017-04-08 14:41:46
0% house edge makes absolutely no business sense. It's just stupid.
The only case where it would make sense is if you were using it to promote another game.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:52:32
Not true in the provably fair space. Usually Bitcoin casinos need to advertise their edge on their homepage (or high up in the FAQ) in order to stay competitive
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:37:01
Thanks, glad you enjoyed it

Or even if there was a way to toggle between price increase and market cap. Or something. I understand real estate is tight so it's tough.

Yeah nah I don't think that's popular belief. I didn't say that, nor did anyone else.
It doesn't make *business sense*. That's why the max bet is so tiny at chain-bet.

Never heard of chain-bet. I'm not a huge fan of on-blockchain gambling solutions -- they're slow, and they don't work with microbets (especially with transaction fees nowadays!).
You can have cryptographic fairness without using the blockchain.

@_date: 2017-04-08 17:34:18


No. In the same way that walking into a casino and putting $50 on a balckjack hand isn't a business plan, operating a casino with no house advantage does not make business sense. Even if you're lucky and win, it is still not a business.


They have a tiny, minuscule bankroll because nobody would fund such a stupid idea, other than a moron. And morons tend to not have access to decent capital.
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:25:33

@_date: 2016-09-23 08:22:55
The fact that Bitcoin lacks a central authority is one of its core virtues. Nobody can regulate it effectively.
This has allowed for developers to experiment with use cases that weren’t possible or even “legal” with conventional means of payments. Anyone can program Bitcoin and the lack of regulation for it serves like a free pass to limitless creativity.
