No, just buy USDC directly. There is no fee. No need to transfer cash to CB then buy USDC, that just wastes time.

Control of everything, except the value. Not to be a downer or anything.

Buy usd coin on Coinbase and transfer to coinbase pro instantly for no fees.
@_date: 2019-07-21 12:22:41
I would buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:32:16
This is a bad idea
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:07:46
Wow, almost as bad as BTC fees!
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:24:41
I have not tried on the cash app
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:58:42
Been using Coinbase for a year. No problems buying selling sending receiving or transferring money at all. Works great. I’ve also seen negative reviews and negativity, not sure why though. Just my personal experience, it’s been fine
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:09:26
That would make sense why I haven’t had problems, I am in the US
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:21:08
This is an odd platform to announce your dementia on...

I actually started using the cash app recently. Which allows for bitcoin buying and selling only, but very easy to use
@_date: 2019-03-05 05:11:15
Yes. That’s what i use. This sub gives it a lot of shit, but my purchases always go through almost instantly and I have my money within 2 days every time I withdraw. All hate towards it is unwarranted. I live in US.

Confirmed: bitcoin is volatile
@_date: 2018-10-07 13:51:19
This happens all the time on every exchange. PSA: Bitcoin is volatile.
@_date: 2018-10-07 15:08:53
Definition has been read. Can confirm. Bitcoin is volatile
@_date: 2018-10-07 14:17:26
Bitcoin is VERY volatile?
@_date: 2018-10-07 15:16:08
Wtf? Smoke anotha one cheech.

Read digital gold by Nathaniel popper. Great story about how bitcoin came to be and gives a great overview of what it actually is. It’s told in the form of a narrative and is a real easy read (or listen as I did from the audible app)

"Bitcoin Paid for my kid's college" not a bad bumper sticker
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:54:26
It’ll be fine. Exchanges are just overloaded with volume right now and people are having a hard time buying and selling. Things will stabilize once the exchanges get it figured out. 5-10% fluctuations every minute are not normal for any currency, including bitcoin. These prices should be taken with a grain of salt, and don’t accurately reflect the market. Hard to think we would go back to +15% a day, but i think it will continue in an upward trend. It will be a confusing day, best to just not check for a few hours and let the companies get their stuff figured out.

Lol 2017. “Cash a participating restaurants only”
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:20:29
Lifetime of education in this case!
@_date: 2019-04-22 07:59:22
Still can’t figure out why people don’t like Coinbase. For a US person it’s the best exchange hands down
@_date: 2019-04-12 02:30:59
13$ is enough to buy a pizza....
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:11:03
Must be the reason behind the recent surge
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:53:48
I like how it says fork.”lol” as if it knows the whole world is laughing at the fork

UBI is the dumbest fucking idea I have ever heard
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:32:33
31% growth per month for a year and a half, sounds reasonable
