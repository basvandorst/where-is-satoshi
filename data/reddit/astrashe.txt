I know that.  But if I'm going to invest in something, I need to know I can get out.
You guys have double standards.  HSBC customers could write a check for an arbitrarily large amount and remove the money that way.  They just won't give their customers cash.  
Also, HSBC isn't fiat currency either, and there are way more viable alternatives to HSBC for fiat than there for Coinbase with bitcoin.

Let me play the devil's advocate here.  I got interested in bitcoin, and I got an account with Coinbase.  I jumped through a ton of hoops with them to get verified (gave them lots of intrusive personal information).  And then they kept changing the deal on how much I could buy and sell, and what my limits would be.
I quit dealing with bitcoin because it didn't seem to be very liquid -- I didn't think I could sell what I had quickly if the market went down.
What reputable bitcoin company can you deal with that will let you buy sell more than £3,000 of bitcoin every day?

I've been thinking the same thing.  I went to Satoshi Square, and I felt really left out with my iPhone.
But how often are you actually going to do transactions in the wild?  If I want to buy Bitcoin, I'll probably do it through coinbase.  If I want to send them to someone, I can do it through my computer.

That's very cool.  Thanks,

That's really scary, and is exactly the sort of thing I'm worried about.
Hopefully if they don't check the balance before the transfer, they're on the hook, not you.
I hope you come through it OK.

Thanks.  I've just got Bitcoin-QT, and I don't have anything on my phone.  It's not very fast to sync, though. :)

I have a different take on this than a lot of you seem to.
Bitcoin is profoundly threatening to their PayPal business.  I think Ebay is just trying to figure out how to manage that threat.  
If they can dominate the space and cut off the air supply of companies like Coinbase, they might be able to keep enough roadblocks up to prevent Bitcoin from taking off among general consumers.
I don't think they can win this game, and so I don't think they're ever going to dive in for real.  Instead, they're going to treat Bitcoin the way MS always used to treat Linux.

Thanks for answering.
I've got Bitcoin-QT on my computer (but no funds in it), and I get what you're saying about not leaving money on the web for longer than it takes to complete a deal.  I was planning on buying money at Coinbase, sending it to my own wallet, and moving forward from there.
I'm not sure I get what you're saying about a bank that will make my loss good if it's stolen.  Are there banks that will do that?  I've always assumed that if someone stole my info and transferred money out of my account with a big US national bank, I'd be out of luck.

This is good to hear.
FWIW, I'm not worried about Coinbase doing something nefarious, so much as I'm worried about them doing something stupid or incompetent.

Thanks.  I'm using two factor authentication as well.  I'm still waiting for my transactions to show up in my bank account so I can get to level 1.

Extremely improbable.

Bay View is a great neighborhood...  I wish I were there to check out your tent in person.
@_date: 2013-09-23 00:01:14
I live in New York, but I used to work for a company in Milwaukee, and I spent some time there.
I have a good friend who lives in Bay View, and so I've spent some time there.  It's a really great place.

I think it's almost certain that they'd do their best to protect my account.  
But every time someone breaks into some e-commerce site and steals credit card numbers, they're beating a company that's trying hard to protect that information as well.

That's encouraging, I guess.  They do seem to be a pretty slick operation.
