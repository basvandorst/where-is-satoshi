I think you are spot on, I haven't seen any argument that invalidates your premises. IMO the price will shoot up rather quick when everybody realizes those implications to hold true. Nobody will want to be left behind and will be a panic buy by small buyers at the same time more institutional buyers continue flowing into bitcoin. This is an excellent entry point for big players that were on the sidelines. Right now it is an excellent time to continue buying.

It is not an attack if it has no real effect, but just an 'intent' at most, and I don't think that's the spirit here, but more to bring clarification to the current blurry VC's status.

Rough transcript:
"...ahh, it is something that entered our lives, it is something that a lot of 
people are familiar with' and with us we have mr George Papageorgiou, he is here 
on behalf of Neo company. Can you tell us, what is this new thing that is coming 
to our lives, how can someone acquire this bitcoin and how are transactions made?"
George Papageorgiou(GP):
"Good evening, lets start from the beginning, to follow up on the discussion your 
previous guests had, that was quite interesting. Bitcoin is designed with a simple 
philosophy in mind: you cannot solve a problem with the use of the same tools that 
created the problem in the first place.
Bitcoin is a payment system, it is an asset exchange system.."
"There is fertile ground for it, given the economic crisis and the way it..[inaudible]" 
"Bitcoin is developed with these ideas in mind: it is corruption-proof, it is haircut-proof, 
it allows every individual to acquire ownership of his/her own wealth without any third-party 
dependencies, it enables a transaction between two individuals without any third-party intervention."
"Allright. So, what is this bitcoin?"
"Bitcoin is the outcome of a technology that is being researched for -at least- the last thirty years.
The creation of a decentralised network in which two individuals can transact digitally and exchange 
monetary values between them, without the need for supervision by a central authority. 
This is the basis of it."
"Ahh, ok.. This, ah, sounds kind of insecure, right? At least from what i hear, the internet, digital stuff, 
without any supervising authority..."
"The supervising authority in this case is mathematics. You see, the bitcoin network is built on what is 
called open source code. This means that all the transactions, the way with which the network operates, 
the rules on which the network itself operates, area absolutely transparent and available to anyone for 
Someone cannot just "inject" a virus, or the wrong code, because rest of the network will simply reject 
these transactions."
"Allright. Let's see how can someone today in Cyprus, because after all now we can, can make a transaction 
with this currency"
"Through our company, an individual can gain access to bitcoins, he can receive reliable information on both 
the positive and negative aspects of it, as well as the challenges around it: because this is new technology, 
a lot of people are not accustomed to the idea of digital money, neither the fact that they can manage it on 
their own.
This is why we need to be informed on the risks and challenges involved"
"So, let me get this straight. I will take a part of my money, if i want to buy something in Cyprus or worldwide, 
am i right?"
"Yes, yes exactly"
"I'll convert them to bitcoin through your company, i will tell the system ``i want to buy``, and ah.. 
 Is there a rate for this, is there something..?"
 
"The rates fluctuate, they depend on supply and demand. The rate to Euro."
"So i'll convert my money from Euro to bitcoin, and after that i'll just buy with bitcoin?"
"After that you can make an transaction anywhere in the world, instantly. This means that the merchant that 
you will choose will receive his funds instantly, at no cost to you. Because there is noone interfering, the 
transaction is frictionless. Same goes for merchants. Merchants in Cyprus that will be accepting bitcoins, 
can have customers from all over the planet, with the transaction received in their electronic wallet, instantly, 
without any third party intervention or delay. At the same time they can check with us and receive the corresponding
funds in Euro"
"And the conversion rates to Euro are the same?"
That depends on the system application at the moment. If, for example, one comes and offers us bitcoin, and 
we have never had a transaction with that individual, then we will move with market rates. But when it comes 
to our merchant accounts we have made sure that they are protected from these rates fluctuations, and we will 
buy their bitcoins at the rate they received them."
"Alright. It is an innovative process in Cyprus. Where is it now, is there any merchant interest, or from the 
general public?"
"People are interested. On the 24/25 of the previous month we held two merchant conferences, in Nicosia and Limassol,
that were attended by over 500 people in the industry. Most of them were interested in how the payments work in bitcoin.
We explained thoroughly the process to them, with the help of the University of Nicosia and we have already made some 
strong alliances with merchants on the island so that in the coming weeks they will start moving forward and accept 
bitcoin for their services"
"Alright. I wanted to ask, how is the world market around it, does it have a big percentage of the market?"
"Internationally, there are approximately 50.000 businesses that accept bitcoin, they are mostly decentralised  and mainly 
they are enjoing the benefit of sending and receiving transactions instantly, from any part of the globe. Many of those 
are internet-based but as time passes we have more and more physical establishments that accept it, like a hotel for example, 
that is making business worldwide and it instantly exposed on an eight billion USD market."
"Alright. This is new for our lives, we will see how things turn out. Thank you mr Papageorgiou and good luck on your endeavour."
"Thank you"

Article summary:
Visa and Mastercard together processed $1.9bn (£1.12bn) in transactions per day last year – 90% of all cashless payments in Russia – equal to a $3.8bn security deposit, the Moscow Times reported.
"If Visa and Mastercard leave Russia, it will of course be a serious blow for both citizens and for businesses."
Snob reported that Visa's representatives believed the security deposit to be too large.

Yes, this is the real reason, early adopters buying stuff and not buying back all the bitcoins they are spending just yet (combined with the fast business adoption selling pressure and the increased btc mining). 
Eventually, their needs will be covered, and they will be also buying when they see the prices won't go back to the 500's...ever again. That will happen until the next upward wave (some call "bubble"). After the long calm and stable period (despite all but good news), everything indicates we are very close to the next boom (over $1000). A possible trigger could be a whole country embracing (and buying) bitcoin, even if it not as big as China. Just my two bits.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:09:33
This is nothing but foolish panic selling by some weak hands and a lot of traders anticipating that, selling also, capitalizing on the inevitable way back. Price is going back up now, since people is realizing 30,000 coins is less than 0.2 of Bitcoin market cap, and the coins are not hitting any exchange, but sold in a private auction.

The price is consolidating more and more, finding a solid rock bottom at above $400, since the bitcoins are being sold by weak short hands and bought by long strong ones. I don't know how many more weak ones are left in China, but it seems that most of the ones who inflated the bubble to $1,200 las year, have sold their coins, or at least the ones who are not really long on bitcoin.

Hi Matt, mmmhh, the economy is anything but stable, is just cooked numbers. Precious metals also manipulated down hard, when they finally loose the grip (and it looks like very soon), the price will explode up, like a beach-ball that they are pressing down under water as long as they can, until they can no more. So precious metals will be valued more according to the sea of dollars produced out of thin air. So hold Bitcoin, Gold and Silver. Good to see you back!

Times are changing and you would make more impact going from negative oriented frequencies (fear/collapse/corruption) to positive ones:
Promote constructive ideas for the new times without resourcing to remembering the negative. Just get on the new paradigm that will leave the old one behind. Focus on forwarding integrity instead of fighting corruption. Being 'pro' instead of 'against'.

This only means people is buying more bitcoin that Coinbaise had in reserve to sell. They keep almost all of the bitcoins on secure, off-line audited cold storage. This happens very often and has happened for a long time, nothing to worry about, on the contrary, this is 'actually good news'.

Here are more resources:
Decentralized/peer-to-peer/worldwide distributed systems are the way to empower the people and bypass banks and all centralized financial institutions, the path to re-set the control from the few to the many, are the future for everything. The potential implications of the development of distributed consensus technologies is revolutionary. 
We have now an open source peer to peer decentralized digital currency. It is very safe, since is cryptographically secured by a distributed global mathematical algorithm and public decentralized open source ledger, a revolutionary disruptive technology called 'Blockchain'. 
This could be the future of money for everything, from donations, micropayments, money transfers, online shopping and bill payments, etc. 
Empowering and welcoming to the game to billions of unbanked people. And the blockchain peer-to-peer open source decentralized secure technology will be used for many more applications, like escrow, contracts, voting, global ledger, etc.
We shouldn't be like the ones that were dismissing the internet not long ago as a "den of pedophiles, drug dealers and terrorists". The blockchain is the biggest thing since the internet and will benefit also the billions of under and unbanked people.

All of the above.
I always use the internet analogy, it is very similar in many aspects, and what people was saying against it then.
We, even at this early stage, are reaching a critical mass that will trigger the real exponential growth/adoption, we are close to reaching the vertical of the "S" curve that all great technologies have followed. With one great difference: Everybody can get a piece at this stage, not after the vertical growth went horizontal again, in the usual IPO stage, when the masses can get but crumbs of the cake.
Here is the cake, for the first time ever,  for someone from the masses (as opposite to elite) to take a piece now, if you are smart and fearless enough.

You don't have to interpret it in a negative way, he is just stating the facts about the call. There is not necessarily  ego involved, that is just your projection.

Also it will make TOR stronger, they will sponsor many smart people (otherwise without incentive/resources) to find vulnerabilities on TOR, which will be patched/fixed right away.
That is just one of the big advantages that the old cronies don't have a clue how technology works and evolves. So I would like to see more governments to put more money into trying to destroy a decentralized entity, the more millions, the better.

Things are changing in unprecedented ways due to the imposibility to kill decentralised distribution and access to information.

Banks have no physical money, just a few symbolic tokens for the first ones to get there withdraw in a bank run, the rest is FED imaginary money.

I like this. Now they will be better funded for the next elections. We need more politicians supporting the future decentralized economy for all the people, replacing the ones clinging to the old corrupt and obsolete power systems.
