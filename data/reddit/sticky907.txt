God forbid you pay for something you enjoy. I pray you don't have kids

Oh jesus get off your high horse

No shit, that pre tax money that you've never actually touched.... of course it wouldn't affect you right now. Let's see how fine you are when you retire.

Very true.

Clutch as in a sick car lol, not a manual tranny

The only ones giving you shit are people with out kids or perhaps just shitty parents. 
I cashed out 6 BTC recently at just above 6k to buy my wife a new vehicle and my kids a dog. No regrets. Whatsoever. Some will say the vehicle is dumb because it will depreciate but fuck them. I got 40k worth of stuff from a 6k investment. Never be ashamed to take profits ESPECIALLY when you are doing so for your family. Good on you man.

Human trannies are still manual though. I've yet to see it happen automatically haha

I got approved for 3.15%. I know I could have made more by sticking with BTC but to what end? I'm more than happy with my decision and I have quite a bit of money left in BTC along with many other coins. 
Don't be scared to take profits. My wife needed a vehicle, and I wanted to get her one. Simple as that. Because of BTC I was able to take a few thousand dollars and buy something fairly nice in cash.

One satoshi is less than a dollar
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:42:54
Why the fuck would you disclose that you even have bitcoins. Even if the wife knew I would just claim that you lost them.

Yea who the hell wants to rent from a bank when you can instead rent from someone else, who is more than likely renting it from the bank... WTF kind of logic is that haha

America has never been a democracy. It's a constitutional republic.

Very true

Just a temporary drop though. Bring it on the crash so I can load up.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:50:32
I was using the Coinbase app about 2 weeks ago and tried to buy some BTC. Cell service was spotty, didn't go through, tried again, tried again a 3rd time, and I almost shit my pants when it confirmed all three attempts. Didn't tell the wife until later when I saw it was actually very lucky haha.
