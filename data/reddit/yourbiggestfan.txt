Hello CanIHaveYourName,  
I wish my fiancee felt the sameway.  
My apologies for complacently keeping to myself, I did not realise I was being a nuisance.  
I cannot speak on behalf of every other voiceless individual but personally I blame Reddit's inadvertent lynch-mobesque  approach to unconventional opinion.  
I've posted to other subreddits before and have been met with a maelstrom of down votes and confrontational messages. Not that the down votes matter, much... ='(  
Now I just observe from a distance the community I once aspired to be a part of degenerate into a mess of opinionated, self entitled garble generally unworthy of any attention.  
Now you wish I had stayed quiet.  
Reason for my presence is that I have no idea but a keen interest as to how this alternative economic system works.  
I hope that with some casual browsing I will come to understand what all these processes are about and how Bitcoin is going to benefit the market place globally.  
Thanks for passing me the mic.

Hello, very new to Bitcoin. Just a few questions, please excuse my lack of knowledge.   
How does work? Where does the tip come from?  
What happens to the Bitcoin infrastructure once no more new blocks are released? What will be the incentive to maintain global hashing power when there will be no compensation to cover overhead costs such as electrical consumption.  
What is the value of Bitcoin based upon? It is highly volatile and from what I've read in this thread mass exchange will result in a noticeable drop in value.  
If Bitcoin is decentralised, how is it governed? This may be a good thing as no one party is in control but how do we guarantee it will not reduce itself into some form of crypto anarchy? What sort of safe guards are there in place for dummies like me to not get ripped off or accidently transfer funds into the wrong account. I think this issue at large may hinder the universal acceptance of Bitcoin.  
Apologies if I'm being really out of touch with what the community is about, I am very new to the whole concept.  
Looking forward to becoming more involved with this subreddit.

So unfortunate, I am very sorry for your friend. I hope their losses are recovered and their homes rebuilt.
