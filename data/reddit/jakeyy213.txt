Right here is one of the reasons BTC will not be used as a medium of exchange... Spending bitcoin would be to painful to go through, especially knowing your subway 4 years ago is worth almost $300 today.

I am not talking about "holding" btc or dollars, I am talking about spending bitcoin. Your logic is flawed, how is buying a good in dollars the same as buying btc? it isn't. I agree, it doesn't matter what currency we use to value goods at. But lets take a step back...
BTC is valued by how many dollars we think it is worth. btc mkt cap is only a small fraction of all USD (for example). As btc is in its infancy, the price of bitcoin will increase dramatically once it has caught on. For as long as fiat is our native unit of account and btc is not massively adopted, it is irrational to exchange btc for goods and services. 
Why do you think everyone calls it "digital gold" and a "store of value". Bitcoin was designed to be in high demand and low supply, we already know this.
Plus tx's cost to much, take forever and don't get me started on volatility. Anyway my point was strictly on the basis of btc becoming a medium of exchange, which right now has no point. Holding bitcoin is better then spending it, period.
Plus, most people that own bitcoin only have it because they see financial gain lol, not because they would like to use it as tender.

What has that got to do with using btc as a medium of exchange? Any way fiat is depreciative so buying goods and services make sense because the longer you hold dollars, the more you lose. Why buy anything with btc when it will just double in a month??

Definitely one of the best introductions to Bitcoin! Here is one of my favorite intro videos by Don Tapscott  
I highly recommend!

Nice comparison, people think bitcoin is overvalued... but is only at an $120b market cap, which is absolutely minuscule.

Your example is comparing two separate things. Buying btc and buying a sandwich are not comparable. BTC is not a good or service, it's a currency. A sandwich is a good. 
BTC is a financial instrument, your subway isn't. You don't go around paying for things in subway sandwiches. 
So your're right there is no difference between your A and B example, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the point. You even said it yourself, knowing btc will increase it is irrational to trade btc for a sandwich. 
Buying any goods or services in BTC will continue to be irrational, until it dominates fiat.

B2X is a joke...

Buying sandwiches with btc or $$ doesn't matter on the day of purchase. It does everyday after, when the value appreciates continually.
Oh well, this is going nowhere. If you think spending btc on goods right now "doesn't matter", then that's you.
