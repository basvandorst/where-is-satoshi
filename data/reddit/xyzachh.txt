Ahhhhh I see, thank you for the clarification in marketcap. My next question then would be, are all exchanges connected and share trading data in order to determine price?
If there was a major dump in one exchange, would the others be late to receive the price update?

Wow, very interesting. That seems like it could be an important thing to consider if day trading. Is there enough variation in the exchange prices for it to be worthwhile to hop between exchanges to exploit price differences?

It's been quite the adventure these past few weeks that have definitely let me start off trading with some respect for the market. It seemed so easy to ride the wave every few days, following moving averages and basics, that I'm almost glad this crash hit me so early before I got way too overconfident.
I'm just going to hodl and take the time to learn more about the market and eventually venture into some altcoins.

I think that risk minimization is the most important takeaway here for me. Respect to you for keeping your priorities straight. And also for keeping a level head about crypto. I feel that on social media and reddit people get a little too carried away about any relatively short term predictions because they have so much time, money, and thought invested into the subject, even though they are less than 1% of the population with crypto on their radars.
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll be sure to read into it!

I understand that the market assumes that all 16.8M BTC are available for use when determining the price. But logically speaking, 100% of the BTC produced are not and will never be in circulation. The market cap, however, is a 100% known. Should this not affect the predicted price?
And my post has nothing to do with the crash. Just trying to learn.

Probably very true. I suppose the market moves with so much strength and is so unpredictable that it really overshadows everything else.

Me too. I would imagine it would have to be fairly significant given how little they were worth. And by 2012 there were already 9M BTC.
