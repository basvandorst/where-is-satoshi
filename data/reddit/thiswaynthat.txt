My credit union has me blocked from coinbase. A bank transfer will work though.

Shape shift did the same to me. I'm missing bitcoin from a trade that never went through. Its been a week. I lost all the profit I could have made and I still dont have my btc back. I'm panicking. If they give me what I traded it for ill lose so much money now.

Yes I did, first with my wallet (coinomi) who said to mesaage shapeshift. Today marks one week since i tried to make the trade. My btc was sent and confirmed but I never got a thing back. Thank you. I've been watching my email and wallet for the return of my btc or the traded coin, I do not care which at this point honestly.

I've had a transaction processing for almost 3 days in my wallet..I did a trade w btc that cost 5$ in fees and I've gotten none of it back yet.

Now I'm almost at a week with the ticket and almost two weeks without the trade going through..all support did was say the network is congested and to not open another ticket. I'd take any of my money in any format back at this point. No good. Just switched to that wallet too, first trade I've tried through shapeshift, never again.

I read on coinbase you will only be able to withdraw the bth, they won't be letting people purchase more from what I last saw.

Attitude gift and seedbank. I opened a bitcoin acct just for their site five years ago. I have no clue what email I used or if I even put money into it. But that's where I'd spend some lol
