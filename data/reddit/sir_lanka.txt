Well. When virtual currency becomes established the price must go up as todays market cap can´t handle enough people. Every fast growing financial investment in human history has had big crashes along the way. As soon as the adoption rate stops growing the volatility can go down.
@_date: 2015-12-23 16:42:34
If you think the price is going to rise the best option is to buy today. 
Another option is setting aside a certain amount of money, use 1/3 to buy today, 1/3 6 months from today, 1/3 1 year from today.

I can recomend [ I have placed over 200 bets and my return on investment is over 100%. A ROI which not is possible on any other site i´ve stumbled upon. This is possible because the betting is made against other people. You can also create your own bets about things of your interest/knowledge and get a comission.

If you already have some coins there are lots of ways.
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:51:40
No the market cap stays the same when coins are lost so the value of the remaining coins goes up.
Atm a Bitcoin can be split of into 100 000 000 pieces (satoshis), but if the value was to go up they can be programmed to split into more as needed. So there can never be "too few left" to remove the value.
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:40:03
Why not? If there was a global lottery ticket market where the average payout is $0.50 it is pretty clear that the value of a ticket is very close to $0.50.
Today such a ticket would cost about $1 in a store because so many people missvalue it. It these tickets could be bought and sold on a online market the price would be very close to $0.50 because the intelligent people with money would buy them if the price was lower and sell them if the price was higher.
True that everything isn´t as easy to value as a lottery ticket. But the principle holds true. Intelligent people with lots of money, knowledge and information is the main driver of the price in an open market. If these people hold a large % of the money the price is more likely to be stable. If they hold a relatively small % fluctuations will be bigger.

There is a lot of ways to profit. 
First of, if you create a bet and people bet on it you will get a comission with no risk.
You can create a sports bet with two teams with the same chance to win. Bet 0.01 Bitcoin on both teams. If someone bets on one side you will on average make a nice profit. If people bet on both sides you are also more likely to make a profit since early bets are worth more. Sometimes you even make an auto profit no matter which team wins.
On bets about Bitcoin price it is in general good to take the negative side, since most people with Bitcoins are over optimistic about the future price.
This is just a few strategies. In general, if you do better reseach and are less delusional than the average user you will make a profit.
@_date: 2016-02-22 16:02:01
If you want to make a profit I would recomend [

1. Knowing who the founder is, is only important when information is hidden. Information is not hidden with Bitcoin.
2. Some try to do. But it´s very hard for a single person to influence the price that way (unless you or your network is ultra rich).
3. Yes clearly. The only way to know what people really think is to look where they place their money. If you look in Bitcoin betting sites you will see that most people expect the price to go up. For example [here]( and [here](
