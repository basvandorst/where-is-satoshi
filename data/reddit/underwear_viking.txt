There's one at the Internet Archive on Clement: it's basically a cash drawer and a computer for transferring Bitcoin, so I don't think you can do huge amounts.

A fun pilgrimage you may want to take is to Clement street.  Both [Green Apple Books]( and [Sake Zone]( accept Bitcoin.  
Sake Zone's super-cool neighbor, [The Internet Archive]( has a Bitcoin ATM and have let the local meet ups use the space.  You can read more about their Bitcoin adventures [here](  Swing by on Fridays at noon for free lunch and a tour.
