The fact with all crypto is that a vast majority of the stuff is held by a relative few people. Combine this with a lack of regulation and you have a recipe for disaster. The winklevoss twins alone probably hold at least 90000+ (based on reporting they had $11,000,000 in Bitcoin when it was worth $120) and that's just the ones I am pretty confident about.

This is called confirmation bias. Not sure why it's such a big deal.

The investing rules that say Bitcoin is rat poison?

Sure it is, just like I invested in the slot machine in Atlantic City.

Sunk cost fallacy what is that?

I actually think it probably has something to do with scarcity of resources but I guess that's considered "old world thinking" in this sub.
