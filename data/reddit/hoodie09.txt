Holy shit!  Cold brew!

hah! Everyone in the cyrpto community would buy it and the game would never end because we'd never buy 3/4 of the board.  While there would be hotels up the ying yang on BTC, ETH and XRP!

In 15 years.... "Son, let me tell you about the night I paid $80000 USD for a beer and blow job!  The funny part was, she really looked like a lady."

Ditto!  You have got to think this is already in the planning stages for Paypal, Apple/Google pay.  Any NFC device with an payment app.  Middleware will make this seamless for the end user.  
I hope you have something that is patented, otherwise your hard work will be a research project.  Good luck.

I only pay for stuff on cc.  Immediate, convenient, in a currency that depreciates.  Ideally I would be paid in crypto and spend fiat.  I think merchants have the most to gain by accepting crypto.  This is only a matter of time when a merchant FI provides an (Ripple Net, XLM et al.) instant settlement near fee-less payment solution.  
The only practical reason I would want to use crypto for payment is for saving on exchange fees in other currencies.

I have expanded the thought.  Serverless bars, recyclable disposable cups, music piped from spotify. A bar as convenient as a laundromat... and about as much appeal!

You sir are the shill.  Can't take Bitcoin for payment, not built to leverage Bitcoin at all.  These could be any protagonist marketed to any interested parties.  Until a cypto does something better and cheaper then there will be no mass adoption.  Oh and thanks for reminding me of school shooting just before Christmas asshat.

Yay!  A decentralized deflationary asset stored and sold by a centralised entity and secured for an inflationary fiat by a 3rd party, charging fiat for the privilege.  That should be easy enough to sell to the average punter, oops, institutional investor.
