@_date: 2013-12-07 06:00:38
Personally I think the opposite will happen. Gold and silver, while having good properties for being money, will get outcompeted by currencies like bitcoin.  
Physical money is simply becoming obsolete in my view.
Edit: Gold's remaining status as a store of value is largely a function of the inadequacy of fiat currencies at being a store of value. Bitcoin plugs those inadequacies just as well, and is additionally an increasingly widely used medium of exchange. It's difficult for me to see a justification for holding gold over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:21:41
He doesn't have to choose one. He can have hubris and like Bitcoin because of the technology and philosophy at the same time. :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:49:27
I prefer arguments to statements of faith and I just wrote a piece on why bitcoin has value as money, so I'll paste it here:
Money is a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. The reason we have money is because barter is inefficient. Human beings have been using money for a long time, most notably in the form of gold, silver and today's fiat currencies.
So, what makes a good money?
There are pretty much 6 main properties that makes something good for being money:
In order for something to be money, you have to be able to bring it with you wherever you might want to use it. Bitcoin fulfills this requirement.
Obvious. Bitcoin fulfills this requirement as well.
The money has to last. Food or milk can not be money because it goes bad (also it is impractical in other ways). Bitcoin fulfills this requirement.
**Sufficiently rare:**
Something that is abundant has no value to us. Bitcoin fulfills this requirement. 
The money has to be fungible. For instance all Bitcoins are completely equal and interchangeable. Diamonds, on the other hand, are not. All diamonds are unique. Bitcoin fulfills this requirement.
Last but not least, and the property that most people seem to fail to grasp. Money has to be useless. That is right. Money has to be useless. Oil can not be money because we consume oil. Anything that has significant inherent value to us is never going to be money because we would use it for different things. 
Fiat money is of course notoriously inherently valueless, but the same is true for gold and silver too (even more so back when gold and silver was considered money). Sure, there is some ornamental value, which may provide these metals with some kind of a price floor, which may or may not inspire some market confidence, but the vast majority of gold is being held primarily as an investment (much of it is held in ornament form as an investment. This is very popular in India for instance). 
Today, gold and silver is not money per se, but it still performs the function of being a store of value. Probably because fiat currencies are so bad at this particular point that the function is in effect being outsourced.
Bitcoin of course has no other uses other than being money, so it fulfills this requirement.
**Feedback loop:** Besides these 6 properties, the potential money needs one more thing. It needs demand. The demand for money feeds on itself. It is a feedback loop. The only reason someone will accept bitcoin is because he or she knows other people will accept it as well. This does not mean that it is a bubble or a delusion or a craze or whatever. That is simply what money is. That is what money always has been and that is what money always will be.
Bitcoin has all these 6 properties plus it has established a feedback loop of demand. Bitcoin is money and just as legitimate in that role as gold, silver or fiat currencies ever was.
So keep calm and acquire Bitcoins.
Note that sometimes in some situations money does not need all these properties. Cigarettes is currency in jail for instance because they don't have many options. 
Fiat currencies is another example. They fail badly at storing value, and the reason they can still be money is due to government fiat. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:15:26

@_date: 2013-12-18 12:05:50
So what? Way way way more people are using Bitcoin now as a result. 
If we didn't have exchanges, Bitcoin would be useless for 99.9% of people.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:56:54
Because most of the things we spend money on do not accept Bitcoin. At least not yet. And again, governments can clamp down on businesses accepting Bitcoin too.
Furthermore, how will you trade your fiat money into Bitcoins in the first place?
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:28:54
I have. 
Look, I understand the concept that media attention, even negative, can sometimes be positive, but books and a currency/investment vehicle like bitcoin is hardly the exact same thing.
I don't see how it is clear that bitcoin is antifragile although I am open to the possibility that it might be. It is probably only slightly, if at all, because I think bitcoin has a final destiny that it will reach someday either way.

The transfer of large sums of fiat money into electronic cryptocurrency is similar to the exchange of media files on the internet or physical cash for drugs, alcohol or foreign currency in what way exactly?
Explain to me why people will go through the trouble to aquire and use Bitcoin if the government clamps down on it. 
The clampdown on copyrighted material failed for obvious reasons. You can't stop people from exchanging data over the internet.
The clampdown on drugs and alcohol failed because of a huge underlying demand for the product.
The clampdown on the USD in Argentina and Venezuela failed (well, it didn't fail as much as it didn't have 100% success) because there was a great demand. Their own currencies were dysfunctional. 
You are delusional if you think you can never stop people from doing certain things with the law.
The clampdown on Bitcoin will not fail and even if it is not 100% successful it would still have a huge negative effect on the trade volume and price of Bitcoin. Governments **can** control their own currency, if nothing else.

Not true. The vast majority of gold is held as a form of investment/store of value. The gold price, if it were based on the rest of the market, would be far lower than it is today.
EDIT: For the record, I agree with you that governments have a lot of power over the fate of Bitcoin. Still though, it has value as a currency in e-commerce and as a store of value. Plus, even if governments clamp down, it still retains its potential.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:40:58

Bitcoin will be more expensive in China than in the rest of the world. Unfortunately almost no one in China will be using Bitcoin which means lower global demand which means lower global price.

True. As I said, exceptions do exist. Exceptions aside though, I'm sure you see the problem with using something consumable as a medium of exchange. Especially in a modern economy.
I'm not sure exactly why salt was used as money. Perhaps it was simply so universally needed by everyone that bartering with it was easy from the outset and that outweighed the disadvantage of it being consumable. Worth noting though is that even during the times that salt was money it was still generally second to precious metals.

Explain to me how normal people will buy Bitcoins if the government shuts down exchanges?
This subreddit has gone full delusional since this recent news.
Yes. Governments can't control Bitcoins. They can however control their own currency and the businesses that operate in their country, and they can make it extremely hard to exchange that currency for Bitcoins and back. A currency lives and dies based on what you can exchange it for.
Explain to me how this is not the case.

In my scenario the price of a single coin could be so high that a satoshi has a real value. In that case if the central banks hold a significant majority % of the actual coins (current and future) the finite supply limit would be meaningless, correct?
No. You're confused. Monetary policy is about expanding or contracting the supply of money. If there are 200 billion dollars in circulation and the fed creates 200 billion dollars more, the dollar i have in my pocket just halved in value (theoretically) because it is now 1/400b instead of 1/200b. 
If there are 21 million Bitcoins in circulation, the fed cannot create 21 million more. If I have 1 bitcoins in my wallet, there is nothing the fed can do to devalue that 1 bitcoin. It will always remain 1/21m.
Infinite divisibility just means that any amount of remaining Bitcoin is enough to have a functioning currency since it can be split an infinite amount of times into smaller units and the value of those units are relative to the total supply, but the total will never increase. 


Sure, but it just doesn't make any sense, and doing this would absolutely wreck price and employment stability, so it is directly the opposite of what the whole purpose of a central bank is supposed to be.

@_date: 2013-12-17 01:46:02
1. Decentralized exchange and OTC trade is way more difficult and will cause the volume of trade will be far lower than what it would be with exchanges.
2. Eastern Europeans prior to 1989 lived in a dysfunctional economic system. Their need for an alternative currency was far greater than say the Chinese'. 
3. This does nothing to address the fact that governments could also clamp down on businesses exchanging goods and services for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:19:12
Governments can ban bitcoins. All they have to do is make it illegal for businesses in their country to accept Bitcoin as payment.
They probably wont, but anything can happen.
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:59:44
The only reason people still trade in dollars after their government has banned it is because the currencies they are allowed to trade in are dysfunctional. Yes, if you ban something, the price of that thing goes up. But guess what, the trading volume also goes down. Especially for a currency. 
The value of the US dollar is divorced from the black market volume in Zimbabwe or whatever. The value of Bitcoin is not at all divorced from the volume being traded in the US. 
If no US businesses were able to accept Bitcoin, then Bitcoin would drop like a stone. If no businesses worldwide were able to accept Bitcoin, then Bitcoins would only be good for buying drugs at Silk Road and the evaluation would reflect that.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:31:20
While shininess is indeed fabulous, I am afraid I must disagree with the rest of your post.
Gold is scarce and never tarnishes, but the price of gold is still a function of supply and demand. Demand for gold comes by and large from the fact that it is currently serving a purpose as a store of value. 
But what would happen if the US dollar suddenly got backed by some precious metal other than gold but with otherwise all the same properties as gold (except shininess)? Suddenly the US dollar retains its value just as well as gold does, plus it is a commonly accepted medium of exchange to boot. Suddenly, any reason for holding gold has evaporated since you could just as well hold the precious metal backed US dollar. This would result in a sell off in gold investments and the price would drop to reflect the new supply/demand situation.
What I'm saying is that Bitcoin will in the future become as good as gold at storing value **and** will be commonly accepted medium of exchange as well. If that happens, then there is no reason to hold gold as an investment.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:23:15

The supply of Bitcoins is finite. It would be useless for executing monetary policy. Also, the central bank's charter is to maintain price and employment stability.
There are so many things, but those are the easiest to explain.
