Until you wake up at 3 A.M, realize that it's 5 P.M in Korea, and wonder if our Asian saviors brought the prices back up...
So you roll over, blind yourself with your phone, and see it's all red still.
There goes any chance of peaceful sleep.

Shouldn't you be in school, young man?

Wrong: the Browns will win it this year for sure.
Be right back, investing all of my life savings in BrownsCoin.

If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a bullet.
Wait, wrong movie.

I think the point is that China banned crypto when Bitcoin was &lt;$5k, and that didn't stop it from breaking $20k within a few months.
So basically, even if South Korea does ban crypto, the long-term effect will be negligible, or possibly positive. 
After all, the fastest way I know of to make people want something even more is to tell them they can't have it.

I just snorted Mt. Dew out my nose - thanks for that.

Can I be a *seed* investor?

Haha this might be true. She does frequently ask me "what my crypto is doing"... The day I tell her a number she likes, she'll probably serve me with papers.

Misread this as  "being a mormon" - sadly, it still made sense.

My wife hasn't fallen asleep yet, but the vacant stare takes over a lot sooner than it did when I first started talking to her about all of it.

Misery loves company. Sorry I had to be the one to introduce you to Reddit's ugly side.

We must know two different Reddits... 
The one I know revolves around two broke arms, a box in a closet, Jolly Ranchers and coconuts.

I can't bear to retell it... And trust me. You don't want to know. There's not enough mindbleach in the world...

Ohh man, I forgot about the spoiled meat. I think that might have been a mental self-defense mechanism. Thanks for the suppressed urge to vomit.

This entire comment thread made my anus clench.
