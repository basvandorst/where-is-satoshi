You should DCA and buy every week or so in smaller amounts. Buying and selling all at once is a good way to get rekt. And you only have to get rekt once.

They're tailors, not bankers. They just happen to be leaving Deutsche Bank.

If I charge you 50-200% more than I paid for a product and you purchase that product in bitcoin, I've bought bitcoin at a 50-200% discount.  It's not just for show, lol. It's a veryyyyyy good investment strategy for small and big businesses that can absorb the initial 'loss'. Or, small businesses that need the cash immediately can cash out their bitcoin without a delay. While credit/debit card transactions pend for \~2 weeks (in case of disputes) before you actually receive that money as a vendor. So if I'm a vendor BTC &gt; USD.

Then move to a socialist country? Also, why are you a socialist buying Bitcoin?

I worked in AML/Compliance. It being a public ledger doesn't prevent it from facilitating crime.. Unless a transaction goes through a flagged address there is literally no way of knowing. Also BTC -&gt; XMR on a dex. So I really can't tell if you're being serious.
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:13:24
You typed a lot but said nothing. Impressive.

\&gt; I’m not a socialist. I’m a communist.    
Then why are you buying Bitcoin?  
\&gt; Why are you, an epic gamer, not calling someone the n word right now? 
... What?
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:52:00
You could wait. But there's no guarantee Bitcoin won't moon 20% tomorrow. That's why I suggest DCA. You can always buy more during dips.

\^ This. You can always RBF (replace by fee) over the bitcoin network (and eth) if this does happen to you and you don't have time to wait for your transaction to drop.
edit: for those who do not know. You can RBF by sending the exact same transaction a second time with a higher fee (**must be same value to the same address as the first transaction**) and the BTC/ETH networks will confirm the second transaction and drop the first transaction from the network. I have 'RBFed' on both networks successfully. However, I have never RBFed from an address in which the value of both transactions could be confirmed without double spending. I have been told RBFs are an intended mechanic of the ETH network, but I would personally not recommend RBFing if your wallet has enough for both transactions.

\&gt; You don't care, yet you still respond. You said you were "done", yet you respond. You don't feel bad for anyone, you're just trolling.
I am done with this subreddit. Literally unsubbed. 95% of posts are low IQ/quality anyways.
\&gt;You have no answers, no rebuttal, that's the actual truth.
I don't think you know what the word rebuttal means. Considering you're making the affirmative statement, you should be providing me with evidence. Not the contrary. You should have learned that in high-school btw.
\&gt; He was racist, you support that, and you have no answer to that. That's the truth.
Have you ever been so racist you got an Ellis Island award alongside Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali? I have a feeling you're a teenager or early 20s, and don't remember the actual Donald Trump in the late 80s-90s. You're confusing nationalism with being white and it's painful to see.
\&gt; I'll help your tiny little mind out by not responding further. You're a piece of a shit. Say hi to Putin for me.
My little mind.. call me a Russian puppet... Okay. So we know what hole you crawled out of. Can you please go back to and leave alone?   
You're about half as smart as you think you are.
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:56:50
Dunno why you're downvoted. This isn't even debatable. It's a fact and a known Democratic party position. Why are socialists buying Bitcoin anyway lol?
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:05:09
It's just really don't care and I'm not actually reading what you're saying. You trying to rationalize why you're brainwashed by a political party and mainstream media isn't interesting at all. I just feel bad for you, nothing else.

It's literally just people taking profit. You're fine. It's called hodl for a reason. Unless you're leveraging you're BTC drops in price do not matter.

I completely agree. Just because someone resisted adoption, doesn't mean they should be treated as an 'enemy'.

I'm gonna be completely honest. The fact that you made a platform in order to be the middleman in exchanging a single btc address is scummy. I get the "promotion" part, sort of. But you're collecting money for doing nothing. A YouTube video + a btc address in the info is more effective and cost efficient than your business model.. 
I feel the same about Patreon..
Sorry fam :/
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:09:11
This isn't true.
@_date: 2018-12-20 02:54:11
But is that really true though? Will you be walking them through their brokerage's KYC, their hardware wallet setup, gas fee troubleshooting etc? I don't think so.. lol.
You're collecting money from people who don't know any better. And it's obvious.
@_date: 2018-12-20 03:02:00
I sort of get the promotion part. Which is why I don't think this is downright fraudulent. But you've created a platform with different tiers of being a middleman, to over complicate the process of copying and pasting a creators address into my crypto wallet.. 
You're providing no value to anyone, rather taking money for injecting yourself into a process that was created explicitly to cut out middlemen like you. I don't get it. There's no value proposition and your stealing money from people who don't know better. There is no convenience factor when you understand the tech, and you aren't teaching it to them.

"users are more likely to buy things they think they understand &amp; feel in control" 
This statement is generally false. The crypto community buys what they think will make them money. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:39:17
Bold claim. Probably not true in the context presented.
