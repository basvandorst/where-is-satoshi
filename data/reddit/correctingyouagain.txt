Nobody is investing, they are speculating.

Good luck, I can't help you.

That doesn't make any sense.  The y-axis is price.  
Also: percentage of what?

I wonder if anyone on here knows how insurance works.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:51:34
I guess I have my answer.
The FDIC mandates are: "(1) to insure the deposits and protect the depositors of insured banks and (2) to resolve failed banks."  Nobody that spends any time worrying about protecting their assets thinks that the FDIC is there to protect them in the event of a systemic failure.

Darfar - I'm a wealthy man, and I've seen and made my share of mistakes.  You are making a ton of errors.  Please stop chasing the end of the rainbow and start working on a plan for your money.

What do you mean?  I just purchased 137 acres in PA using dividend income.

Who cares.


No you don't.  You aren't investing, you are gambling.  You haven't invested yet, based on what I'm hearing from you.

Because that chart is scaled in such a way to mask a 50% drop maybe?

Sometimes it is helpful for a dick to come along and tell you that you are fucking up.  Obviously you haven't gotten sick enough of losing money, or being poor, to change.

Please stop.  You are speaking out of your ass.  Banks fail all the time.
FDIC maintains a "very small"* reserve (1% of protected deposits), but can borrow against future premiums if that reserve is depleted.

I get what you are saying, and I like the concept of currency free from government interference (for example, this shit:  
My question is why bitcoin?  Right now, most bitcoin is held in hoards by early adopters.  A lot of "meatspace" wealth put into bitcoin by speculators (fully fueling this runup) are going to evaporate when those coins come into circulation.  My second question is what are the threats to bitcoin?  I know they are many, and do not consist solely of a break in the crypto.
