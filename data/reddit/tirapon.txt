Congrats dude, $4500 aint too much to cry over if it goes tits up, although with all the ongoing development I believe you will soon realise that you made a great decision.

How did you get the blockchain wallet identifier?

You're doing the right things:
 
-Don't invest more than you're willing to lose
-Jump in with a modest amount to play around with and learn how things work: this is the best way to get to grips with things
You seem sensible so I'd imagine you'll pick things up pretty quickly. Just remember to watch out for scams etc. and learn best security practices. Invest some time in understanding how the protocol works, this will help you to understand how to store coins safely.

Nice, so Bitcoin is edging its way towards the mainstream - I mean, sci-fi is quite niche and aimed at a demographic who may well already use Bitcoin, but at least its turning up in popular culture in some form.

Hi, was just reading an AMA you did a few months ago. Hexayurt seems like a really awesome thing. Hoping to read up on it a bit more. Its not much but here's $20 towards the project, hopefully every little helps? @_date: 2014-12-31 01:56:22
When was this book written? Before or after the Bitcoin whitepaper was released?

$5 - If you don't already use changetip, its really quick to set up and you can then easily transfer from your account to any address.
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:38:51
Hehe, seems like you're adding to that $100 pretty quickly! I see 8 tips sent your way so far. Have a beer on me too :)

I've used blockchain.info since I first started trading Bitcoin - no problems, and a great service all round. These recent security issues are unfortunate but its good to see they're acting to put things right. Hopefully people will learn not to store large amounts on web wallets, and use them instead for small amounts purely for convenience.

Why did the price not tank further when Chinese exchanges halted trading? Since late 2013, the Chinese market has more or less dictated the price. However, on this occasion, big news out of China has only had a minor effect.
Perhaps the ETF is more likely to be approved than many are expecting. Those in the know are buying now, and that's keeping upwards pressure on the price? If the market were pricing in denial of COIN, wouldn't the combination of that plus negative news from China have caused a much greater crash?
Any more wild theories people want to throw around?

You should also have a look at the history of price movement. When I first discovered Bitcoin it had already been through a major bubble and crash cycle in 2011 (peaked at $32 and then crashed back to $2). I wasn't aware of Bitcoin in 2011 but it was useful to see that it had recovered from such an extreme swing in price. Guess it helped prepare me for the volatility.

Just received the same - clicked on 'get started now' and it asked for a blockchain identifier. Did a quick google search and ended up here... Maybe we should contact blockchain.info staff? Seeing as this is posing as another service from blockchain (and looks pretty convincing too, I nearly fell for it)

Probably wouldn't hit the 8MB limit for another few years.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:56:32
But higher block sizes means more fees per block, so larger block sizes are also more profitable. If miners are thinking long term, it makes more sense to gradually scale the network to accommodate all transactions on-chain, and collect all of the fees. Otherwise, a portion of transaction fees will be collected by service providers who allow off-chain transactions (taking a small fee for each one), and then consolidating a days worth of transactions onto the chain at a time (for which they pay a slightly smaller fee, and keep the rest as profit for acting as middle men) 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:52:30
How about:
8MB blocks now
Increase to 64MB once the number of transactions equates to full blocks at 8MB (approx. 2-3 years)
Increase to 0.5GB once we reach the 64MB ceiling. (another 2-3 years)
Evaluate hardware costs, storage capacity, and internet speeds (around the year 2022).
And base your comment around some variation of this model, rather than assuming that a block size increase equals 1GB blocks starting from right now.

Uber and Airbnb both use Braintree to process payments. Braintree announced that they would be working on Bitcoin integration a while ago. They're a subsidiary of Paypal.

If it survives the months of arduous sniping and inability to achieve complete consensus, and comes out stronger than before, then that's pretty reasonable grounds to say that its anti fragile. Lets see how this plays out.

I've been to Luang Prabang - didn't come across anywhere that accepted Bitcoin, I guess I must have missed it. What's the name of the place?

You're meant to wait until at least $700 for this one, now you've caused a pullback.

(All it takes is ONE country to say, 'Fuck it, we don't benefit so much from the current system anyway... We're not gonna ban it'. And then all Bitcoin businesses move there and they become incredibly wealthy. Meanwhile, Bitcoin users around the world continue to not give a fuck because go ahead try and shut it down then you retards.)

Have you ever heard the phrase, 'A fool and his money are easily parted'?
You don't even know what arbitrage means, and yet you are trying to day trade. You don't seem to realise that you are quickly losing your own and your sister's inheritance. In a very short time you will have no money left, which would be absolutely fine except that your sister will have nothing either. 
I seriously hope you are just trolling - if not, you should give what's left of the money to your sister immediately and then get a job.

Just signed up for a gyft account. First of all, let me say I think its a great business model, a really good way to spend coins, and I hope to see you guys continue to grow and add more options! Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the selection of gift cards available for use in the UK. We have a pretty big market for gift cards, worth around £5bn a year - I'd love to see more development over here! If you could suggest who we can write to in order to help see this happen, please let us know.
