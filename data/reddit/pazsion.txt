can never have too many coins. I've been asking for more. It's no where near as cluttered as some sites have it. There is a pool with over 125 coins. but it's all sectioned off, with pull down menus to attempt to keep it from looking cluttered. But it ends up taking hours just to get the coins setup. only because of the way that site chose to lay it out. Eobot has the right idea. I like everything loaded, clickable icons. just scroll. pull down menu's list everything. the icons seem to keep the numbers from clashing into each other. less confusing.

36282 , always looking for more cloud services and after 2+ years eobot is still the best. Just wish we had 5 yr scrypt back just need something that doesn't expire, i'll be getting more busy and even more forgetful. I also like that your adding stuff that is helpful, like the faucet and ppd cloud. I hope we can get seti cloud going without loseing any more coins from our portfolio. Lost $8 value just from 2 coins being removed. 24hr boosts are super helpful. maybe add longer rent times. Thank you for the hardware update / additional. super happy dance.

yes it was very scary there for some time, but eobot kept checking in nearly everyday during the time it spent at 100% fee. And he had been planning on upgrades for a while. Getting them online and available was a game changer. Planning for the future is one reason i still use eobot. I hope he doesn't let it go down/offline next time. But i don't think anyone could have forseen btc being so low like that. many alt-coins should be more valuable then they are as well.

i like knowing my values all the way out to 8 exponents. some sites do more. And being able to use even small ammounts. If you need larger text try zooming in? ctrl-+ or view

It might be possible to integrate stakeing earned into the btc conversion in the current payout models. Would not need a separate "pool". If the wallets were operateing and updated and actually staked. Paying for hash with pos coins would then help increase profits. Because it may be rarely spent, it'd just earn. rdd can cycle to help increase pos values. maybe sell/trade up pos coins every 90days. i think that is generally doable across all pos-coins? But people would pay for additional services, like a pos cloud pool as well. Even if technically eobot already is stakeing.
