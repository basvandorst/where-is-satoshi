I just donated to creative clay :) .04 btc (no bot here to confirm but it's there!

You have the best idea of all!  I am bitcoin tipping you some (never done this before so crossing fingers).

I plan on it!  Keeping bitcoin legal and paying our fair dues. I am an attorney, so I know the law is in flux, but I will carefully evaluate all realization events.

Does anyone do a Kiva-like project where we direct-donate to the poor in the third world?

To be honest, I didn't need the money, but I believed in the idea of it and why it is so cool!
I'll be honest, I started using bitcoin because I could play online poker, and in the USA, this is impossible due to bank restrictions.  It's not that it is illegal for an individual to play, but it is illegal for banks to pay you and certain other bank-related activities.  Bitcoin obviates the banking bs.  
Once i lost a bunch of money on seals with clubs, I was still enthralled with the currency, and saw my opportunity around $70/bitcoin this Spring.  Prof$t :)

I created a throw-away since people who talk about having money on this forum seems to attract all sorts of thieves and people trying to steal bitcoin.  But i still really wanted to engage the users here in an open discussion even if no one wants to admit or talk about their earnings so far this year.

Here's a terrible question to ask, but I almost want to earn more money with the money I've made so far in order to donate more later down the line.  I imagine this is a horrible idea, but it still sounds appealing for some reason.  I really like the Air-BNB idea, but I also love the creative clay organization.  I already gave to the red cross this year, so I am sort of diversifying for my charitable donations the same way that I do with my investments.  Now if only I could claim my bitcoin donations to get an IRS deduction, hmm...

I forgot about Sean's outpost!  Just gave them .04 :)

Thanks for all of the ideas!

I like the idea of diversification into other crypto-currencies, but I'm unsure of what % to keep in bitcoin.  Right now it is about 99% bitcoin, but I do like litecoin since it is very similiar to bitcoin in form-and-function, but it is less scarce/easier to mine.
