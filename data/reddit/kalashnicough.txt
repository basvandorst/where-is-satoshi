I too am interested in hearing about why Counterparty lacks long-term viability.

Well aren't we just the special little snowflake? Let me ask you, how much NXT do you hold? Because you sound like just another pump and dumper trying to squeeze some money out of your NXT investment with your misinformed and vitriolic bullshit.
For myself, I'm disillusioned with NXT thanks to DGEX and how shittily it's run. They ate the NXT I sent in and wanted to trade, their contact form is broken, and they don't respond to emails. Their decentralised exchange sucks, too - Counterparty's is streets ahead.

Actually, Litecoin came out only ~2.5 years after Bitcoin. If you look at other technologies like Blu-Ray vs HDDVD, the one that wins is the one that gets adopted by companies. A lot of businesses have decided to adopt Bitcoin without any pushing from the Bitcoin dev team (i.e. they decided on their own, or "organically") and that number is growing; other crypto, not so much. We're beginning to see the same kind of organic growth on Counterparty, and it's only been out a little over six months; I'm very confident that growth will not only continue but also increase in pace in the near future.

By that logic we would have had a cascade of clones superseding Bitcoin itself. Additionally, I'm not sure which bit of that quote is relevant to Counterparty? There was nothing equivalent to a premine because Proof of Burn, and there's no "easily forkable get-rich-quick model" either - Counterparty is gaining popularity and value organically, not by paying people to develop on their platform.

So why aren't we seeing these services around NXT? And why isn't Byrne announcing anything to do with NXT today?

I don't see anything like BitPay for NXT. As for Patrick, I'm sure he's not so weak willed as to be "convinced" by third parties - he would have done his research and give with the protocol that made sense.

Er. How about "cryptome"?

Maybe include some details as to what happened?

Singapore I believe, but Australian Consumer Law applies if they sell here. I'm not sure how much can be done, but Australia does have a decent relationship with Singapore...

Ditto. I had two positions open last night: a short position (target price $420, stop-loss at $483 and change) and a long position (target price $500, stop-loss at $380-something). I woke up this morning to an email that my short position had closed out. "Oh well," thought I - the price jumped to over $500 before crashing back down to the low $400s while I was asleep. No big deal...
Except that I didn't get an email about my long position. So I check their site, and it's down. So I look around the internet for an answer, and wait, and check back periodically, and wait, until I got an email that my long position had closed out too because it hit the stop-loss price! "How very convenient for them," think I. Can't imagine how many other people this might have happened to, but I have emailed Mark Hergott directly and will be filing a complaint with the ACCC back in Australia (as that is my country of residence) if I don't hear back about a refund in a timely manner.
