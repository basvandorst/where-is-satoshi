I'm navigating these waters with you as well.
I have seen a channel state go from CLOSINGD_SIGEXCHANGE to FUNDING_SPEND_SEEN to ONCHAIND_MUTUAL where it then stayed.
Eventually the log showed "onchaind complete, forgetting peer" before a FATAL SIGNAL 6 occurred and lightningd crashed. After restarting I am still seeing that peer in my 'getpeers' list.
I'm not looking for technical help here... just acknowledging the shared experience =)
One issue I've found, and am trying to understand it better before more formally reporting it, is the routing doesn't seem to take into account the various channel states. A route is found through, say the ONCHAIND_MUTUAL peer, but if you try to pay via that route it errors with "first peer not ready: WIRE_UNKNOWN_NEXT_PEER".
No complaints. I'm enjoying getting a hands-on sense of how far along lightning is progressing.

BitPay lets you specify a bitcoin address under the Settlement config. You get the benefit of their nice POS interface (for both online and in-person) while still having full control of your settlement address. Also, no fee taken by BitPay on your first $1,000,000 (?) in sales. Seems foolish not to use them.

I'd argue it allows for an open market of mining competition resulting in a stronger more secure network.
Perhaps we should ban pools as well as they allow even scrypt miners to 'centralize' their mining efforts?
I think the decentralized nature of the bitcoin protocol is a different thing than the centralization that occurs with ASICs and pools.

How much would you buy one for?
@_date: 2014-09-08 03:17:47
I'm confused. BitPay has had a web-based POS interface for over a year. It works quite well and -- MOST IMPORTANTLY -- does not require signing in to access the checkout page. It also works identically on iOS, Android and Windows Mobile. It only requires something with web access.
For instance, here is a random BitPay checkout page:
By not requiring signing in, a merchant doesn't need to worry about the security on a tablet. If their cheap Android tablet gets stolen, they aren't signed in to BitPay, the iTunes store, the Google Play store etc etc. You can use a tablet with zero credentials and only require web access.
I just checked on my BitPay merchant account and they no longer provide links to the simple web-based checkout page like above. You have to instead go to:  and then enter a pre-generated pairing code. This isn't a bad solution, but isn't as quick and easy as a unique checkout url for each merchant.
tl;dr - I consider the app-based POS a step back from the no-credentials needed web-based POS solution.

From my experience (setting up local merchants with a bitcoin POS system) they want *EASY* and have no opinion on 'open' or not. Having a single bookmark icon that reliably goes to their checkout page -- even if cookies get reset -- was very easy.

Hi Jon. Thanks for your reply. Re-reading my original comment and I apologize for the overly critical tone.
I should have started by discussing how wonderfully tiny Skyhook is, and the excellent robust all-white metal case, and the simplicity of the external-facing hardware and the overall professional build quality. Asking a store to install something like this is so much more approachable than a gigantic Robocoin.
Re: updates... is that something that can be done OTA?
Also, your projectskyhook.com/setup page has been throwing an error since I first checked yesterday.

The plastic isn't fragile, it is just designed to not go back together after coming apart. Check out this image: 
You can see the plastic edge is a little mangled looking... and putting the two pieces back together doesn't do anything. Perhaps some crazy glue would hold them, but wouldn't be as pretty as when you first got it.
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:39:23
I just received mine today as well with plans to bring it to our local meetup group meetings. A mobile ATM to facilitate purchases wherever we hold the meetups.
The speed is definitely going to be an issue. It isn't clear to me where the slowdown is happening. Scanning a QR code should NOT be such a slow process. Hell, even the initial "touch to begin" has a significant delay.
I don't doubt that the Skyhook guys have tweaked it all they can, but I need to do some digging to satisfy my own curiosity about why it feels so slow.
Another concern is the raindance needed to get everything started up. Perhaps it will get easier as I do it, but so far the sequence of booting the tablet, then booting the internals, then enabling tethering, then running Firefox and hoping it eventually finds the internal webserver... just hasn't worked consistently for me yet.

Where are you announcing the answers?
@_date: 2017-02-19 05:15:13
Hm, I guess this comes down to what your definition of "using Bitcoin" is. Your definition seems overly-stringent to me and ultimately will just cause confusion for newcomers.
I would argue that if you have ever sent or received bitcoin, then you have "Used Bitcoin". Why draw the line so aggressively that it excludes a huge amount of people that are actively learning, buying, spending and USING bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:27:16
In the scenario you describe, won't that centralization negatively affect the value of the Bitcoin network ultimately resulting in a drop in price as people migrate to other less-centralized coins?
Why would miners make a decision that ultimately loses them money?
Question for BU people: can EC be used to lower the blocksize or only raise it? Obviously previously mined blocks may be larger, but perhaps the consensus is only about the size of NEW blocks that will be accepted (and already accepted blocks are grandfathered).
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:17:17
I think if the EC model for block-size discovery was adopted we wouldn't see all miners signalling for a 32MB block size. Instead I think there would be tentative small increases to strike a balance of moderate fees (keep users happy so they don't go to alts) and keep some fee-market pressure (keep miners happy so they can keep mining with reasonable txn fees).
It was my understanding that at the Feb 2016 Bitcoin Roundtable there was a general consensus from miners around a 2MB-4MB block size. This kind of moderate increase seems like it would have struck a reasonable balance between lower fees and an active fee-market.
Makes me wonder how things would have played out if the block size had been increased back in mid 2016.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:03:24
My thinking is very aligned with yours. I get your point.
It seems to me that Bitcoin is where it is today *because* it was easy and cheap to get started. We used to send small amounts to newcomers at our meetups to show them how cheap and easy it was. Now at $0.75CAD per transaction we no longer have that easy onboarding for newcomers. 
I really struggle with how I think this should all play out and get really frustrated with the two extremes that are adamant that their solution is the *only* solution.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:49:28

It seems it was auto-moderated as his account was brand new.
@_date: 2017-03-31 19:11:34
I would expand a bit on the 'puzzle friendliness' to include how mining difficulty is determined. The miners are trying to hash the transactions so that the resultant hash has a certain number of leading zeros. Using leading zeros of the hashes is a puzzle-friendly way of defining the mining difficulty.
Check out all the zeros before each of the latest block hashes.
And then compare those to the hashes back in 2012:
Then all the way back to 2009.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:51:47
The nodes signal via their User Agent string which software they are running and this can be an indication of what kind of scaling approach is desired.
Check out [Coin.Dance]( for some pretty graphs on how various support is changing over time.
I would be surprised if the miners didn't pay attention to those numbers when gauging community sentiment.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:51:42
What number do you see as "enough" nodes for Bitcoin? 
I so often read about concern over the dwindling node numbers when everyone was migrating to SPV clients... is that no longer a concern?
Does it actually become detrimental to the network to have too many?
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:17:19
A free mobile wallet app can also be considered true ownership -- just don't use it for significant amount.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:44:17
Perhaps it doesn't do anything for the user running the node, but a full node that is properly connected to the network definitely helps make the network stronger. Another copy of the blockchain, another relay for transactions, another reservoir for new nodes to pull from when coming online. Sounds good to me.
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:34:49
I have mixed feelings on the update-frequency setting. 
Personally, when using other similar widgets, no matter what frequency I selected I would still force-refresh it when I go to look at it. So, I figured, why be refreshing all the time, using up battery, hitting my server needlessly if people can just refresh when they look at it?
I'm playing with a change that will 'gray out' the widget slightly to indicate if the data is more than N minutes stale... and in that state a single click forces a refresh rather than the click - flip - click as it is now.

When you setup your Trezor, your are given 24 words to write down. These words allow you to restore a brand new Trezor to the exact same set of bitcoin addresses as your first Trezor. There are other wallets that can also be seeded with the same 24 words to access the same addresses.
More info: 
You should have at least a pin code on your trezor so that the thief can't access your funds without some slow, manual brute forcing. Even better is to use the 'passphrase' option of the Trezor so there is essentially a 25th word to your seed that you need to enter each time.

Good article. I appreciate the calm rational perspective on what is usually a very drama-filled discussion.
It is my understanding though that SegWit will be a significant component to making it easier for businesses to ease many of Bitcoin's problems via 2nd layer tech. Too bad malleability wasn't patched up back in the Mt.Gox days. Perhaps so much of this ~~child~~ could have been avoided.

I'm thinking of putting an ad on craigslist (and our local equivalent) explaining the offer. Get the merchants to come to me rather than me cold-contacting them.
I also have some merchants that have shown some hesitation once I get to the part about how the transaction would actually work. If I can offer a functional tablet that will operate like a nice touch-screen POS device, I think it should reduce friction.
I think focussing on merchants where you already have some connection and credibility will go a long way. Once they are up and functional, they can help pass the message along to other interested merchants.

CaVirtex offers a cash bill-pay option. It works similarly to the previous cash deposit. Would that work?

I was frustrated with the blockchain plugin because it doesn't have any type of URL for 1Password to reference. Signing in became a real pain, so I've gone back to using the blockchain.info site directly. Anyone have a workaround?

And I guess there is no rationale for a sudden collapse. As the 'smaller' miners drop out from lack of profits, the larger miner's profits will increase accordingly. A mass exodus by some will just be an opportunity for others. 
Absolutely no sign of that graph levelling out anytime soon though. Very vertical at the moment.

I do hope you are kidding.

I emailed support and received a 0.08 BTC refund. So, I lost 0.02 instead of the whole 0.1
Better than I'd hoped after yesterday's thread.

I thought the title meant I could *pay* my bills (cable, phone, electricity etc) via VoS. Using the bill-pay feature to get funds *in* to an exchange isn't such exciting news for me. CAVirtex has been doing that for months.

How about some links to blockchain.info of transactions showing your mini spend + msgs to accounts you collided with?

I've watched the BitMinter hashrate rapidly climb from ~40 Th/s to 115 Th/s over the past 3 weeks. This increase in hashing power seems to mirror the network as a whole according to the chart linked above.
That spiking 3-day green line is just incredible! I guess everyone is finally getting their ASICs.
I am curious what people think the implications will be of such a spike. 
On one hand I'd imagine that the the glut of ASIC deliveries will dissipate and the spike will just level out a bit. On the other hand, when a spike like this happens in nature (population boom) it typically collapse catastrophically. 
Looks like the next difficulty jump will be &gt; 30%.
Edit: changed Gh/s =&gt; Th/s

It is, but I always hear it is 'crippled' in some way to comply with Apple policy.
I have it installed and can send and receive bitcoin through it... Is it because I'm in Canada? Does the US-installed version not have the wallet functionality?

Thanks for the link. I've now contacted them to see if they can help in some way.

Do you restrict your Blockchain acct to only certain IP addresses?
I do and I had similar issues to yours after I upgraded to a new phone. 
I fixed the problem by signing back into Blockchain on my phone while on one of the allowed IP addresses. It continued to work fine after that.

Thanks for posting this. I just made a 1BTC order from their store. Big fan of honey and bitcoin -- a perfect match =)
