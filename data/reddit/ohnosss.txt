wow.... I think I finally get the kooky bitcoin community references now.  
What you're missing is the fact that your monetary units do not decay over time.  When you hold onto your 1 BTC, it **remains** 1BTC a year from now.  The value does change, but the # of BTCs you have does not.  
In what world would you possibly want to lend out 1BTC to get 0.96BTC a year from now if you can hold onto it?
Your entire position rests on the fact that if I do _not_ lend out my 1BTC, I will not have 1BTC a year from now.  Somehow, my 1BTC is going to turn into 0.95BTC.  But that's not the case.  Your 1 BTC stays 1BTC forever and ever.  and ever.

Yes, I'm fully aware of how interest rates are calculated and the difference between nominal and real rates.  The fact that bitcoin is hard coded to be deflationary makes the economics of lending very difficult.  
Think about buying a house.  You borrow 500k monetary units to buy a house.  However, Your house is represented by less and less monetary units over time.  Your salary also stays flat or goes down in terms of monetary units.  And yet, you still owethe bank 500k monetary units.
You're totally right that monetary units represent value.  If that's the case, then as the world makes more " things", we also need more monetary units to represent those  "things".  That's what monetary policy and the fed help to do and why fiat currency makes sense.  Money and value are two human concepts, and one represents the other.  When value increases, so should the money supply.

you transact in monetary units, not value.  
Let's say I did borrow the 1000 BTC today.  I did absolutely _nothing_ with it.  In a year, I give the bank 980BTC?  Boom.   I pocket 20BTC.

Again.  Why don't you send me 1BTC today, and I promise to give you 0.96BTC in a year.  You'll have more value and come out ahead per your logic.

it's also not 5% profit.
1.008BTC x 104 potatoes = 104.832 potatoes
Don't lend, I get 104 potatoes year 1 for sure.  So your profit is 0.8% (0.832/104)

This makes no sense.  Economics is subjective and a social science because at it's core, it's the study of human behavior.  People's perceptions, values and reactions.  Having a math based currency changes none of that.
Just look at the bitcoin market and the widely fluctuating valuation.  It's not driven by math.  it's driven by people's perceptions.  Nothing's changed, except that the underlying asset happens to be based off math.

Why would a bank not hold onto the 1000BTC?  
Option a) lend out 1000BTC, get 980BTC in a year.  
Option b) Keep 1000BTC, and have 1000BTC in a year.
For what you're saying to work, the "deposits" in the bank would have to assessed a negative interest rate every year so that Option b) results in &lt;980BTC if you don't lend it out.  Starts to get pretty silly.

Again, value is great to think about, but at the end of the day, you do not transact in value.  You transact in monetary units.  Otherwise, what purpose does the monetary unit serve if you cannot transact in it?
Can you imagine saying to someone, give me your house.  In 30 years time, I'll give you another house + a car.  Sure, you're transacting in "value", but does it really make sense?
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:30:31
there is no such thing as a "value" unit as you're thinking about it.  If you use these value units, it essentially becomes bartering.  Bank loans me 100 potatoes,  I pay the bank back with 105 potatoes.  Bank loans me a car.  I pay back 4 tires year 1, four doors in year 2, and finally a whole car in year 3.
If you want to standardize "value" units, then it by definition is monetary units.  So then why would you even have the original monetary unit to begin with?
And the benefit of fiat currency is exactly that.  You can change the supply to meet demand, without being artificially constrained by the physical # of supply.

Maybe the better question for you is:
Today, you have 1BTC in your wallet.  Deflation is 4%.
You forget about your BTC.
In a year, you remember and open your wallet.
How many BTCs do you have in your wallet?
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:34:34
Better yet, let's do this.  
Send me 1000BTC from your account today.  I *promise* that I will give you 980BTC exactly one year from now.  We can even write into the contract that I'll eat a hat if you don't get 980BTC from me in a year.

backed by govt.  USDs also have inherent demand. Employees, suppliers, customers and taxes are all paid in dollars so people want/need dollars.  bitcoins are backed by hodlers and fairies.
