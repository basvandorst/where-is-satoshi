After the Nixon Shock where he severed the Bretton Woods agreement w/o notifying the hundreds of other countries involved, the USD became it's very own fuly floating fiat currency. LBJ had tried to create the "Great Society" that cost money, Vietnam was gonna cost like 500 billion, Nixon continued the welfare reforms blah blah blah
The USA just didn't have the reserve in gold (Bretton Woods) so in '71 Nixon just tore it up. BAM, now they could print as much money as they needed. I'm not a gold nut, but a frenchman with sharp wit once said “Paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value – zero” 
U.S. gets involved in Yom Kippur, energy crisis of '73 that lasted far too long for the real Americans, the ones standing at the pump which only increased panic, causing people to buy AS MUCH gas as they could. Y'know Panic. Panic making a situation worse. Sound familiar?
Kissinger convinces OPEC to only accept USD, causing demand for USD worldwide to rise. If you were a huge conglom, the petrodollars made you rich, if you were an average joe or even worse a third world country you got screwed. IMF loans and austerity out the ass. But hey we got oil from ME! It's not like we don't oil reserves of our own..... or wait do we? /s  
So after that tangent where now reading I don't even remember what my point was.
Yea, 1btc=1btc might be nice. Whether it's market manipulation, real lifesss, Economics. I don't know. Couldn't care less.
Be interesting to see what happens tho.
