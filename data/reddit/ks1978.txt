Really enjoy reading econ Eli's stuff. Glad he's writing on bitcoin

The Coin Cloud BTM at the TravelLodge gift shop. They also run the BTM at the Gold Spike. I don't get to that one much its on the other side of town from me.

Robocoin on strip was probably out of cash. I use it all the time to sell bitcoin for cash and the few times it hasn't worked thats been the issue. Operators are quick to respond and refill it. Just a matter of emailing them

Big miner/seller based in Vegas. I almost always use the BTM on the strip. Lowest fees (5%) in town and if you preload your Romit wallet don't have to wait around for any confirmations. Also, it always has cash. The other ones around town seem to not be stocked usually. 
I've tried the BTM at Jacksons and it had outrageous fees of 13%. I've heard it is the same as the D too cuz its the same operator ZenBox.

How has Jordan not been fired from RC yet?
@_date: 2015-06-14 00:56:15
Wow. this is dirty. Surprised at how overtly aggressive they are. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 01:26:21
LOL no mention of the onerous legal and ongoing compliance costs? Of this article course from the perspective of manufacturer. Robocoin and Lamassu will say anything to sell you one of these things. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:56:54
Looks like Robocoin has lubed their assholes for a class action suit. Ambulance chasers on alert! That is if RC has any money left in the bank to pay out. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 06:14:10
Very little chance these operators have set up properly the strict ongoing compliance programs and audits required by finCEN. Not to mention the several other regulatory bodies that have jurisdiction over these activities. Only a matter of time before these guys get walloped. Proceed at your own risk. When did WSJ give up honest journalism for bitcoin ATM PR blasts. I guess blame the internets.

So you guys are making atms too now?
@_date: 2014-11-17 10:00:23
Wow, wtf, people are still buying Robocoins?! 
@_date: 2014-11-28 11:08:55
Nice work! Lol Robocoin business model worthless a few weeks after shitting on their operators. What a bunch of scammers. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:54:39
Nice. Gotta say tho these operators seem to be risky if in US. Blatant disregard for OFAC guidance if it is fully anonymous as you say. Probably too small to be on radar of regulators but will be fined in bankruptcy if they something goes bad.

Bitcoin ATMs are reliable and easy. Just trade cash for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 02:29:48
Post on localbitcoins.com too
There is a place to list ATMs

Bitcoin ATM
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:07:15
Haha hilarious. Not sure I feel Mike Tyson is the guy I want to be buying bitcoin from but I hope he can execute. Could be great for bitcoin in long run or could be disastrous if anything goes wrong with this. GL Mike! 4.8 mil twitter followers is nice press for bitcoin

Coin Cloud machines are 100% 2-way
@_date: 2015-04-10 04:34:27
BTM on strip (in gift shop) and Gold Spike (2 min walk from D) are always live. 
Checked out BTM at outlets on charleston. It wasn't up either. I think this one is operated by same guys at the D.

Prob a good idea to get a new identity after ruining their name 5x over already
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:11:59
These are a POS. I used a similar at thai place in vegas and it was basically an Ipad with cash acceptor on it. I heard these units and the lamassu weren't even compliant in the US. Are these guys just flying under the radar or am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:37:39
To be clear, you are saying the hardware does take photos as the user is purchasing and on future visits? Not just during the ID scan routine?
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:31:00
Galaxy Digital have a website? Trying to find more info but not much information out there.
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:10:02
Thanks. How specifically? I met a couple of the bigger operators at a conference and their lawyer said don't touch these tabletop units with a 10 foot pole in the US. Something about KYC/AML this and that. Not saying he's right but it seems like the guys at scale use the bigger freestanding units. I'm curious why
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:29:58
My understanding was that the hardware itself wasn't taking live photos of the user while using the machine. Thus no way to confirm who was using it. It was a hardware limitation not a user error. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:26:41
IIRC, I was told the issue with these ones was the camera isn't taking live shots of person in front of kiosk. Thus, there was no way to match current user to ID the user scanned. Is that incorrect?
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:06:17
My end goal is to operate my own BTM but after exploring the space I realized it wasn't for me. Too much investment in compliance and risk of ending up in jail. I'll definitely look at it again because it sounds like I was misinformed how those table-top units work. Thanks for insights

Love this. Been a fan of Selgin for a while. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 03:11:47
Despite its occasional flaws, I regularly use the Robo on the strip. I do a lot of selling and its much preferred to BitAccess. It is always stocked with cash and it dispenses cash instantly. I withdrew $6500 and had all the bills in my hand in 20 seconds. With the bitaccess DT I have to pull the notes one by one. 65 notes one at a time if I'm lucky they are all 100s.

This has to be one of the worst researched and biased articles I've seen recently on Bitcoin. He even cites Professor Bitcorn!!!
