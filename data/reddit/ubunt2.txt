They just need to open their books and be fully transparent ...
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:02:37
how is it closed when the 'attack vector' is unknown?
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:52:18
so people expect the exchange to continue as normal??   
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:14:18
Fair enough, but people want to see numbers from a financial audit, not just a security/IS review ...

TheEconomist supports Hillary, what do you expect?
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:52:59
so how could they move, if they are multisigs and no one is signing?
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:32:38
who are these 'auditors'?
I don't see any certified auditors on their staff page:
Just developers and ETH people ...

better sooner than later, to get this issue squared!

Wow ... 13,000+ comments, so what's the alltime record for most comments?  
@_date: 2014-11-07 15:21:17
seems more like a publicity stunt ...
@_date: 2015-05-08 13:21:24
be prepared to wait to get fully synced ...
I waited days for the blockchain to download
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:39:41
% is what matters ...

"via a trade done through Telegram"
Sorry for your loss, but you really can't trust anyone on the internet... especially on Telegram.  
There's really nothing that can be done... you can send him a message through the blockchain asking for him to reconsider his actions.

it's a senate seat in Georgia not US Senator ...
@_date: 2019-11-30 02:26:04
ok thanks ... I stand corrected, article reads a tad funny
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:31:42
I agree, they were just forced to disclose 'hidden microphones' on their nest products.  Said it was 'an error' not revealing it ... everything is logged.

popular? even democrats are distancing themselves from her ...

Global Partners provide clean water wells for towns in Southeast Asia/India. One well can supply a town of ~5000 people access to clean water.  (unfortunately dont think they take direct bitcoin donations)

Coins earned from harvesting or masternodes, should be counted as ordinary income or what?  
So that income doesnt apply to netting out capital gains ...
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:23:41
cointracking.info is another crypto tax software
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:01:02
so true
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:54:09
thanks, cheers!
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:43:06
POI ... is it a game changer?
@_date: 2016-05-24 23:16:52
obvious, OKwave along with many other public traded companies in Japan choose a private blockchain (mijin) to do business on.  That's the market's answer ...
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:46:09
interesting piece on Proof of Importance
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:10:26
do you own your own website, what kind of marketing do you have?
I'd love to earn in BTC :)
@_date: 2016-05-24 19:38:22
OKwave also uses mijin/NEM for user ID authentication!
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:20:08
the Ethereum foundation spends 340,000 CHF a month!  Must be nice, but yeah they are struggling ...
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:37:29
interesting, but timeframe should be longer than 45 days ...
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:00:52
This part is big, likekind treatment:
***"The bill also instructs the IRS to make changes regarding the taxation of cryptocurrencies, transactions where one cryptocurrency was traded for another would be nontaxable, as well as simplified ways to claim gains or losses at the end of the year."***
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:10:48
doesnt that just allow you to add more to your fee?  or can you also change the amount sent? 
how does this 'replace' the transaction?
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:25:36
yes, going on 4 weeks for my support ticket ... sigh
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:14:38
