The title describes a payment button which is nothing more than a piece of html that opens a javascript modal or links to another page. The actual feature is the payment gateway that accepts multiple currencies. Mentioning paypal or a button is putting it in layman's terms which may be fine if you're appealing to an audience other than IMO.

I'm sorry perhaps I'm lost, I thought this was a bitcoin sub. I certainly don't need everything being described in terms of what paypal already does. Especially when it's not something new that hasn't already been created by others in the bitcoin community. Perhaps a proper comparison would have been bitpay. But you'd rather use layman terms for a different audience which defeats the purpose of a sub specific for technical news/information on bitcoin.  Perhaps you would be right if this were IMO

I'd think the majority here aren't new, though I haven't taken a poll, I've lurked here for 4 years. The reason why it's relevant is because to those "veterans" or experienced people(which I believe to be the majority, not overwhelmingly), this isn't something new. In terms of e-commerce financial terminology, we don't refer to things in terms of what paypal does. The suggested, correct, and accurate, terminology, when possible, is more appropriate; thus my criticism. Can everyone be expected to do that? No. Hence why it didn't bother me that much until I'm called out for even mentioning it.

The title doesn't mention multiple currencies, I'm glad you see that as important because that's my criticism here. The button and paypal are irrelevant to the audience If it were another audience, say one that doesn't use bitcoin, then yea it would make sense to describe it as being "an equal option alongside paypal". Bitcoiners know what bitcoin is. Also is this 2014 again? Cryptocurrency gateways aren't anything new and "alongside paypal" is dumbing it down from "payment gateway" for people who don't know what happens when they go through a checkout.
edit: 2014

That is sweet. It looks like they have plugins for a number of other platforms as well: wordpress, woocommerce, magento, zencart, wp-ecommerce. As well as a [custom integration API](

This has nothing to do with paypal, unless you're trying to explain point of sale to a layman whose only ever used paypal before. Coinbase is now providing merchants with a payment gateway for crypto. It's not a novel idea, bitpay has done this for a while, as well as many others. With the integration in shopify, as well as the reputation coinbase already has, that means more competition which is good news as it could increase the number of people accepting and using bitcoin.

I require zero-knowledge proof.  A photo with a message would suffice. Or you could put one of your gold shoes on your head.
Though I actually have a lot of questions:
* How early were you into cryptocurrencies?
* Do you have any cryptocurrency investments that you regret? 
* How much, if any at all, did you sell at $20,000 USD before the drop? This show was probably recorded before that january correction. 
* Is it difficult hodling that much when you started with much less by comparison? 
* How did the media get in touch with you? They must have known you were doing well from cryptocurrencies.
* What are your predictions for cryptocurrencies in the near future? 
* What advice would you give to people buying their first coins today?
