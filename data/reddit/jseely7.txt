Still unable to withdraw and still no response from Bitstamp support!

You just need to relax, it's all good in the hood!

From an outsider's perspective that seems like a horrible ad, from my perspective however, I liked it!

It wouldn't be to hard, every day or so they could just copy all entries in the user identification database to another group of servers that would be kept offline. After the copy is successful they then just need to purge the online database.

&lt;Aquent&gt; Do you know you're a giant asshole?
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; Yes of course I do, I stole everyone's bitcoin
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; I'm actually looking for my next long con now
TLDR: Source or this is fake

Also they could be enforced as a collective agreement between users and the exchanges and be verified through independent audit just like the solvency audits that are currently happening.

Sorry to tell you this but the world runs on compromises. If there was no such thing as a compromise nothing would ever get done.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:34:57
The same way current exchanges are REQUIRED to collect that identification

Welcome to Bitcoin!

Although I have great expectations for Bitcoin, I don't think it's currently ready for use by these large organizations like Amazon. There are some issues that need to be resolved not only in the protocol/miners but also in terms of ease of use. The problem with rapid expansion with a new technology is it could and most likely would fall on it's face driving away people who might actually believe in it.

Safer than in Mt Gox apparently!
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:27:25
Right... and what do you have to support that?
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:30:55
Of course Mt. Gox's internal records would say they still had all the BTC they should have!
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:44:51
You mean more complex then how Bitcoin works!

Is Venti large or small?

I love how in every interview when they ask "how did you first find him?" She always answers it from the perspective of him already being on the table and they proved it from there. But she said in the other CNN interview that one of their data sources was people actually named Satoshi Nakamoto. So basically what they did was take everyone named Satoshi Nakamoto as their original pool of names and then eliminated everyone they could. The fact that they found a japanese engineer named Satoshi Nakamoto I would argue is actually pretty high!

I'm not talking about coins I'm talking about all those pieces of identification we are required by current regulation to provide to exchanges. If I'm required to entrust them with my identification then I want a guarantee that that information is secure and will never come back to bite me.

Why not take the encrypted content offline too?

Care to share this proof?

The vast majority of Indians who would have access to the internet would also have taken English in school their whole lives.

I think OP was referring to a country watering down it's debt though inflating it's currency. That debt coming from war. See if I give money to charity and if charity saves life therefore I have saved a life.

Solid hard evidence is not the only evidence you can use. Not everything in the world is defined explicitly there is often a lot of implicit or deduced evidence of things.

Although I haven't bought any with them yet I have a level 3 verified account and so far the site seems to be pretty good.

I know this won't sit well with the libertarians in this subreddit but, regulation is not a explicitly good or bad thing. Regulation just as any tool can be used in good or bad ways. I believe this would be a good consumer protection that could help save users of exchanges from future troubles caused by exchanges being hacked.

Oh interesting everything I've read so far said 2011.

So they finally got back to me, aparently there have been phishing emails going around and I guess they saw my email on a public list so their bot disabled transactions until they could talk to me. All in all I'm quite content to deal with no withdrawals for a few days for this type of security!

Only MtGox

This would be equivalent if we were to look at the early banks in North America. In which case you'd probably see the same thing you're seeing right now with bitcoin. There would have been people saying why would you leave your money in a bank it looks like they get robbed every other day!
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:33:19
While you are right I make this mistake a lot as well due to being raised in a french immersion program. The french standard is to put the "$" after the number.

Except it can be proven that they aren't stolen as that address was used by him and hasn't been used since.

I wish the title of the article had of been "Real forensic evidence proves Newsweek named the wrong man as bitcoin's creator"
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:44:33
What I was saying was I would expect less new money to be entering MtGox as this issue is becoming more talked about. That would in turn reduce the price gap between MtGox and Bitstamp. Maybe people just aren't getting the word. Also why would anyone buy from MtGox when the price is 20% higher, it makes no sense. And if they aren't buying from MtGox then the price should drop and approach the Bitstamp price.
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:05:53
Thanks for the info! Could someone please confirm this?
