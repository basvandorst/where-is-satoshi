Thanks for the detailed list. I see your fundamental flaws as *worthwhile* trade-offs, differences, risks or growing pains.
To me the compelling mainstream upside is still unclear but will emerge from the intersection of:
* **[permision-less access]( (no need for proof of personhood/identity/vetting/authentication....)
* the novel **proof-of** attributes of the blockchain
   * proof of control beyond ownership / custodianship / local jurisdiction
   * proof of solvency for exchanges/custodians
   * proof of lock / escrow / joint ownership / multisig
   * proof of expense / transfer / transparency / auditability / "carbon-dating"
   * proof of timestamp / provenance / publication / existence / integrity / non-tampering
   * proof of signature / pseudonym
   * proof of irreversibility / single-spend
   * proof of public commitment
   * proof of scarcity (fixed inflation schedule)
   * proof of validity / genuineness (not counterfeit)
   * proof of burn / costly-signal / deposit
* and the attributes of true **digital** embodiment
   * [shrinkable down to 12 words](
   * concealable through digital steganography
   * backupable
   * able to be at several places/jurisdictions at once
   * shareable (though not transferable) through *any* communication channel
I'm guessing by your first post that despite your negative view on bitcoin you still see some merit in decentralized ledgers. What's your guess as to what they will ultimately be used for?

This would **instantly turn slacktivism into crowdfunding**. I love it.
We need:  
* **integration** so that it's as easy as clicking a button right next to any message.
   * cut down on the ChangeTip **clutter** on feeds, kind of like how "likes" are grouped already 
* an **icon** that's as memorable and simple as the now universal thumbs-up. Perhaps a tip jar? I'm still not convinced about the hat icon ChangeTip is currently using (though I like that it puns hat tip).
* an **action word** as good as "like". For English, "tip" is already great and it can cross languages easily. 
* a **default** amount that most people don't overthink about. A nickel or a dime is a good option.
  * unlike *likes* which are single, you should be able to *tip* as many times as you want
Note that Facebook integration hasn't even been released yet as of this moment on ChangeTip :(

Thanks for your thought-provoking comment!
Bitcoin's crucial advantage over Esperanto is indeed incentives. I'm racking my brain looking for comparable early-adopter advantages in language: the chance of being the language's Shakespeare? having everyone speak with your word coinages? emulating your style?
**Language is to knowledge very much like money is to wealth!** ESL for access to knowledge IS very much like reserve USD for access to markets. Brilliant analogy.
And finally, yes, the vast majority of the developing world IS looking at the West for guidance in regards to bitcoin, just like in much else. Most of us here in the developing world are just stuck trying to solve more immediate, lower-level problems.

I went and checked back the quote from Marc Andreessen I was paraphrasing and it turns out it wasn't in the Econtalk podcast I originally quoted (!) but in a Washington Post interview -- I've since updated the link and now use the full quote.
So I thought you'd like to know that the quote is actually an answer to the question: "Is there anything tech companies can do, whether on the Snowden stuff, or culturally?"
Marc is a wicked smart guy, candid &amp; idealistic in his own way. I _strongly disagree_ with his calling Snowden a traitor but I can see where he's coming from and I respect his opinion. For an opinion I disagree with and don't respect, see [David Brooks's condescending narrow-minded Snowden critique](

You could skip the rant but that would be like saying that if you get everyone to call something a duck (better even, to redefine duck as that thing) then it IS a duck. That's true but it's a difficult way to go about creating things and it will not solve your problem if what you needed was the properties of the original *duck*. Seems to me you need both, community acceptance &amp; intrinsic ("hacked together") properties. **There's a real tension here, value is a social idea but it is *not* just social.** I wanted to highlight the nonsocial part.
Here's another way to think about it, bitcoin as a digital song. You don't care that you can't hold a digital song with your bare hands or see it with your bare eyes because you CAN listen to it through a computer, and so for you, it IS music. Bitcoin has the properties of value you're looking for and so for you, it IS value... and so are the other crypto currencies. Now, not all digital songs have the same characteristics (rhythm, style, popularity....) and so they are not all equally useful to say, pump a crowd, but they are all still music.
(Thanks for your comments btw! :)

Bitcoin's killer-app is to be the *first* decentralized crypto-currency. Thanks to side-chains, it will also become the  definitive *base* crypto-currency.
I think bitcoin has been [ARPANET]( so far, and [sidechains]( will be what makes it THE internet of money.
The real mainstreaming killer-apps, the email/WWW/browser/Google/Wikipedia/blogging/FB moments, will only come after sidechain-support is implemented sometime in 2015. They will be built as sidechains and apps further up the stack.

Great writing Erik. I happen to agree with your politics/ideology and love how well you express them but I wonder if we wouldn't be better explaining bitcoin to newcomers as simply **teleportable cash**.
I've often seen it described as *digital gold*, which isn't bad.
But almost no-one thinks of *gold* as an everyday medium of exchange and *digital* seems too vague to me. 
When you say *cash* most people naturally associate a certain level of privacy and sovereignty (everyone knows cash is the "official" currency of counter-economics: black markets, slums, drug dealers, money laundry, rogue countries, refugees from tyrannies...). *Teleportable* conveys simply what I think is the main practical benefit of digitality for most people.

Nice. Thanks for the pointer to Baudrillard... I should really get around to reading him.
As to your second paragraph... It feels to me that you're mixing price in there... What markets do every day is price. **Price is not value, but a relative, numerical assessment of value.** Price is the weighted sum of individual time preferences.

All diagrams are from the original paper (and every diagram in the paper appears in the poster). All text too comes from the original paper, only occasionally tweaked to make it standalone. Emphases mine.

I [did end up printing this]( on 13x19 B+ paper and I'm hanging it on my wall. I wanted a way to keep the essence of the paper at a glance.

Rereading the paper after a long time, a lot of the crypto details have become clear, even obvious. But I'm still mystified &amp; stunned that this elegant decentralized network has kept working almost uninterruptedly after so many years and so much exposure. 


Maybe it's a bit like the astonishment early 20th-century people might have felt at witnessing man-made heavier-than-air flight: what keeps it from falling? [how can wings work? where does the lift come from?](

It's a continuum, all these examples are highly decentralized too and have been feted as such. Inherent in a chain is the idea of cumulative, undirected edits &amp; forkability, which stand for a high level of editing decentralization. Git repositories are perhaps the closest example to Bitcoin's extra level of decentralized stage (but Github brought back a centralized stage by being immensely useful).
@_date: 2014-10-08 16:48:57
Haha, right. Though of course, ideally, the settlement of a supertanker or 2 shouldn't move the market much. In this context, Tim Draper's $10,000 3-year price-point for bitcoin makes more sense.
A few months back when [the idea of trading oil in bitcoins]( was mooted around, it struck me how bitcoin could have real utility even at the agent level of sovereigns. Some 200 guys (world countries) are stuck trading their most valuable assets against IOUs from one guy (US) that prints them out of thin air at its whim. Bitcoin could be an objective standard for nations not just for individuals.

Hmm.. it's actually even more complicated than I thought, so it's hard to think about fiat value flows, even in vague max/min terms. All we can tell from that is 7,578,314 coins **did not stay still** since November 13. Not only may the movement may have been someone shuffling their own coins, not a transfer, but the coins may have moved *many* times not just once (there were far more than 7,578,314 total coin movements during the period).
It *is* fascinating all that we can know about the bitcoin economy but it's still tough to tease out meaning from the data ;)

Git is [often described as decentralized]( Decentralization of a git repository is achieved via distributing every contributor a local copy, there is no privileged central copy. Why do you say Git (NOT Github) is centralized? What would it need in your opinion to qualify as decentralized?
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:04:19
I see 2 plausible non-exclusive scenarios for the short-medium term. Early next year we should start seeing more clarity on them:
1. My pragmatic **hope** is that the new abilities (chief among them permission-less access) of cryptocurrencies will become established either through compromise legislation or through exploiting &amp; defending existing legal liberalism &amp; loopholes.  
If not in the US, in London, Singapore or somewhere else that wants to be the next financial capital of the world. There have been two comparable decisions before upon which much of the online economy is built:
  * The DMCA [exempted from direct and indirect copyright liability]( Internet service providers and other intermediaries (like Google &amp; YouTube).
  * To this date, the remnant [federalist constitutional tradition of inter-state tax-free commerce]( in the US has made online commerce not state-taxable in many states, in practice or in law.
2. My pragmatic **fear** is that a state-approved big-company segment of cryptocurrencies will appear, while the free-for-all will be persecuted excessively for a while, but ultimately not quashed, just heavily marginalized. Choosing what to transact in will be a matter of circumstance/need/opportunity: just as you know have the option of paying for a fast, convenient movie on iTunes or downloading it for free from The Pirate Bay to play with it (remix it, back it up, share it) without DRM restrictions, enduring more technical complexity &amp; the risk of spam/illegality.

**Is multisig a public attribute of a bitcoin?** Can bitcoins have proof of multisig? Proof of joint ownership?  That is, can anyone look at any given bitcoin stored in an address and tell if spending requires several private keys? Or is it something only the parties to the multisig are aware of?
If multisig is public, can I see that on blockchain.info or another blockchain explorer? Can you point me to a multisig example address? Thanks!

I think you'll really enjoy Nick Szabo's [*The dawn of trustworthy computing*]( essay, just published last Thursday. He discusses 2 BIG, novel ideas very relevant to your thoughts. First, he proposes thinking of the Bitcoin network as the first **blockchain computer**: a virtual computer abstracted from many traditional computers to provide extremely high reliability &amp; security via *the Nakamoto proof-of-work consensus*. Second, this blockchain computer (very slow at the moment compared to our normal computers, but getting faster) is perfect for running **fiduciary code**: "code that can be trusted, and because of that, can control assets." ([as put]( by The "wisdom of crowds" direction (which I myself have flirted too many times) seems now to be an unnecessary quest for a magical new consensus algorithm when we already have one that works beautifully --it's just slow &amp; inefficient, but that's to be expected, it was only invented 6 years ago. :)
I think the answer to the oracle problem will be to *gradually* migrate our legal/financial/governance infrastructure towards fiduciary code running on blockchain computers.

The alternative paths to revenue, **altcoins** &amp; **crowdfunding**, he strongly dislikes because of [his skepticism soliticing funding from the general public for high risk highly technical efforts]( as well as the [the sketchy jurisdiction-hopping they resort to to avoid their serious legal complications](

Thanks for joining in Very stimulating comments!:)
The fundamental problem a chain tries to solve is: how can a diverse group of agents collaborate &amp; trust each other without a central authority? The chain answer is something like **permission-less but peer-reviewed appending**. 
Forkability, reversibility, record-keeping, up/down voting, verification methods like diffs &amp; cryptographic signing, costly signals like proof-of-work --all of these are crucial implementation details on which the workability of the core answer hinges.
The beauty of the core answer is that it's so universal it's also [how insects work]( how ants develop their food trails or termites build their nests. Perhaps, as you say, life is a chain not just literally (DNA) but also in this abstract way, with genes as the agents.

You can show your support of the EFF with bitcoin! The EFF accepts bitcoin donations since May 17, 2013 (["*EFF Will Accept Bitcoins to Support Digital Liberty*"](

Fair enough, Git is never really used (to my knowledge) in a massively peer to peer fashion like Bittorrent or Bitcoin. But distirbution is not always done through a central repository, git allows for fairly decentralized workflows and these are very common in agile projects, at least at the beginning. I've worked in many projects of 3-4 programmers where one of us starts the repository and shares it, but then someone else takes lead development (without asking permission) or everyone does development in parallel, only ocassionally merging, and it is only in the later stages that a central, production repository emerges. I would call that decentralized.

3 days ago shared [this cool blockchain analysis]( 
that I then formatted:


































Note that these stats are about **moving**, which is *much* broader than **buying/selling**. So a *very* high upperbound for coins bought/sold since November 2013 is 7,578,314. What's remarkable is how high this is, it's way more than that of any past period and even more than all past periods put together.

**This is misguided doublespeak &amp; groundless FUD.**
I read the whole thing and I'm racking my brain trying to understand how bitcoin enabling sidechains will IN ANY WAY thwart Pebble or any other new/old "free-floating" altcoin OTHER than in providing competition (potentially better sidechained alternatives). Yes, path dependence and network effects kick in, but that's a natural effect of anarchy and time (that's, for instance, how words coalesce naturally in language).
Just because you complain several times that the analogy between Bitcoin and TCP is "totally false" doesn't convince the many of us who *do* see how it could be true. Look, the analogy stands for **the belief that a common protocol** (Bitcoin with pegged sidechains) **for exploring the diversity of financial technology can be converged upon**. You claim that this protocol can't possibly work because a key piece (Proof of Work) is impossibly flawed. Fine, so then the protocol will collapse when challenged by better ones. Showing that there just can NOT be (or should NOT be) a common fintech protocol is a different matter.
There will be no Bitcoin police to enforce a "Bitcoin monopoly" --if most future development ends up being side-chained it will be because people (including miners!) find it worthwhile to choose to build on it. Does it bother you that miners get to chose what to mine on?
If you want to test a better consensus mechanism to Proof of Work, *what exactly will stop you?* Go ahead, release Pebble in the *months* that will take to implement sidechains (or after, because absolutely nothing will change to stop you) and let us be dazzled by its supposed brilliance.
In the end, it seems you're just **indignantly comparing a clear, detailed proposal with vague, unpublished, ideal hypotheticals.**

This is fun &amp; *very* inspiring, but it would **absolutely** require user confirmations: we even have to endure a bothersome user prompt in Chrome for something as trivial as a video going fullscreen [because of the security risks]( moving actual money is at a whole nother level of potential abuse. It's very easy to underestimate just how wild &amp; unruly the web can be compared to walled gardens.
With some very careful permissions (even more complex than those for allowing links to open a new window after the popup wars), you could have true zero-click *micro*-payments restricted to a domain. It would be **awesome** if, say, your Reddit upvote could automatically donate, say, a dime to OP.
A nice tweak would be to have the actual price appear on hover in the status bar (as URLs currently appear when hovering over a link). Also,  just as the status bar now tells you "Waiting for Reddit.com..." you could have "Waiting for payment to Reddit.com to complete..." messages (just for the payment to propagate through the Blockchain, not, of course, the ~10min for it to confirm)

You say: 


BUT at the 22may2010 pizza price, a bitcoin was worth $25/10,000 = $0.025 so **with the ENTIRE present stock of 13.35 million bitcoins only a RIDICULOUS $33,375 in value could be transferred** --effectively useless. To use bitcoin, real users need the real value provided by speculators.
has it exactly right. Marc Andreessen [recently expressed it well]( with the same reasoning: 


Speculation has been crucial and will remain so: there are still many use cases for which we're still undervalued &amp; **speculation is itself what's holding the value floor until we reach true scale with real killer apps.**
I of course agree though with your general point that the real dream goes far beyond a skyrocketing price :)

Thanks for such a great comment!
I think the crucial difference between Bitcoin &amp; Esperanto is the *incentive structure*. Bitcoin is as much an innovative achievement in social engineering as it is in computer science.
* * *
Thinking about the fundamental flaws Bitcoin &amp; Esperanto try to address gave me a lot to think about. Bitcoin introduced math as a new source of monetary authority, to compete with the central authorities that give us fiat money (flexible but unreliable), as well as the authority of physical attributes that gives us commodity money (reliable but inflexible). Math offers the promise of reliability AND flexibility.
Esperanto *does* try to solve a fundamental flaw, but this is seldom acknowledged even by its proponents. It represents a comparable improvement over natural languages to that of the alphabet over ideograms or the Hindu-Arabic number system over the Roman system. These are brilliantly elegant ways to give symbols **universal** reach versus clumsy systems riddled with inconsistencies that make them hard to learn &amp; limit their utility. The alphabet maps *all* sounds in a language to a few letters, positional number systems map *all* quantities to a few numerals and Esperanto tries to map *all* of grammar into a few morphological/syntactical rules. 
Both alphabets &amp; the Hindu-Arabic system took *centuries* to be recognized as an improvement and in both cases the decisive push came only after technology finally exploited their universality: the printing press for alphabets, computers for positional number systems. Perhaps we're still waiting for Esperanto-based technology. :)

I loved your description of money as "a protocol for communicating _credible_ information _about value_". Yes, the money/language analogy is one of the most important ones in Western thought. I love how this 1996 paper puts it:

It means they use free rides for **new Uber users** (notice the small-print of the ad) as marketing.
This ad has no business being upvoted, it doesn't imply anything meaningful AT ALL for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:55:28
Totally agree with this. I'll rephrase and highlight your conclusion for my personal digestion:
**For financial value to be modelled (embodied, instantiated, reified...), both scarcity &amp; consensus are required.**

Yup, that was kind of intentional. So I wanted to emphasize the part about substituting of the Fed with an algorithm. He argues both for a steady rate of increase as you well point out AND a bit later for simply freezing the money stock. Bitcoin will do both ;)

Gravity is currently 11,067,975btc and will steadily increase until it reaches 21,000,000btc. ;)

I wonder about this interpretation of what speculators do, it feels so droll to me to think of them as a group devoted to determining value. The other day I was reading that Chinese BTC exchanges were the first to show the records volumes and price rises which spread afterwards to the other exchanges. This was described as that market *discovering* the new higher price.
Anyway, it's just a weird way of thinking about speculation but it's probably correct. Though I doubt it's a conscious act. Consciously, speculators' motivations are pretty much simply greed and easy money, and this is where the hate comes from.

An interesting, rare angle to the "**Why should I trust an idea?**" question is to mention examples of common, simple methods to guarantee trust, like *indentures* (a duplicated agreeement torn in half for authenticity) or *divide and choose strategies* (someone divides a resource, someone else gets to pick). Bitcoin is an elaborate, innovative set of such ideas/methods that has fascinated economists &amp; programmers the world over.
Good luck FredEE!

I fully share your interest in trying to find stories, narrative or scenarios featuring cryptocurrency. My personal conclusion is that **the future got bigger and different after bitcoin**, in [ways that were considered practically impossible before]( and we will need a new generation of science fiction.
While Neal Stephenson's [Cryptonomicon]( which I have only skimmed, deals with crypto-currency it is NOT the descentralized kind, which is in my opinion the truly revolutionary aspect of bitcoin.
The more suggestive work I can think of is Daniel Suarez's [*Daemon*]( and the sequel, [*Freedom*]( which don't deal directly with cryptocurrency, but the whole conceit of the books --a self-sustaining civilization-altering program unleashed after the death of its author-- is curiously homomorphic to bitcoin.
It's not fiction, but I like David Friedman e-money scenarios in his 2008 [*Future Imperfect: Technology and Freedom in an Uncertain World*]( He writes just before bitcoin was unleashed unto the world!
Cory Doctorow's [*Down and out in the magic kingdom*]( deals with Whuffie, a reputation-based "ambient" currency for a post-scarcity economy. The interesting part is that with colored coins, it could be very much implemented with bitcoins.

I also thought immediately about Cory Doctorow's **whuffie** concept! :) Just for the sake of a thought experiment, imagine that in a few years hence we routinely carry a QR code lapel on our clothes with our public Whuffie bitcoin address. We would all be wearing Google Glasses and sending each other a tip would be as simple as a gesture, viewing each other's Whuffie would be an automatic overlay.
The money value of this Whuffie-colored bitcoins wouldn't much matter (we could all be playing with satoshis say) but what's fascinating is that Bitcoin's public, pseudonymous nature, could allow your wearable computer to parse the entire reputation path of any given user. So you could see, for instance, if this particular person has helped any of your friends or family, or has helped causes you believe in.

Awesome job smeggletoot! The best ad I've seen yet on bitcoin. Loved the  design and the pain/less detail. The bitcoin side looks a bit lonely in comparison with the more detailed HSBC but maybe that's intentional for clarity? Anyway, I promise I'll remix this tomorrow and share it with you and on my FB (tonight I'm too sleep deprived!).
**Your money laundering angle was pure genius**, I had never thought of that. As a Mexican I feel personally enraged that the convicted financial enablers of the violence ravaging my streets got a mere slap in the wrist. They let billions of dollars get away and then they claim a right to look into my finances, delay my transactions and make me kowtow to cumbersome regulation, all under the pretext of money laundering? Fuck that. Think of the money laundering is the new think of the children.

I'm confused, he's saying **exactly** that.  He proposes "freezing" the money stock which is just another word for "fixing".

The one-line summary (rubric) of that opinion piece is particularly worth sharing: "**Regulators should keep their hands off new forms of digital money such as Bitcoin.**" This is HUGE, because this is a magazine regulators and their aides read.
Bitcoin is also positively covered in this week's edition as a regular, longish article, [_Mining digital gold_]( Here the summary is: "**Even if it crashes, Bitcoin may make a dent in the financial world.**"
This positivity and sense of possibility stands in sharp contrast to the previous coverage in the magazine, which was marginal and on the fence:
* [_Bitcoin: Monetarists Anonymous_]( (Sep 29, 2012): "After a spectacular crash, an online currency makes a surprising comeback"
* [_Virtual Currencies: The bursting of the Bitcoin bubble_]( (Oct 21, 2011)
* [_Virtual Currencies: Bits and bob_] ( (Jun 16, 2011): "Bitcoin has got geeks excited. What about economists?"
Oh and in _Economist_ parlance, that's not a briefing (in-depth articles, like a dossier) but a leader, which are short, opinion pieces on major issues of the week. In other words, **this is _The Economist_ acknowledging Bitcoin is one of the biggest things happening on the world this week.**

Thanks for the comment! You expand and improve on the OP's submission. I just tweeted a compressed amalgam of yours and OP's submission's (  ) and have been bouncing these ideas off with anyone around I could grab. This feels like a big naming breakthrough.
