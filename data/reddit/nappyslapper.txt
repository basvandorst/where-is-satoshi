Are you being intentionally dense?

Destroying the planet, 1 farm at a time.  Good job!
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:22:17
Oh shit yeah, i forgot that exchanges don't hold funds!
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:52:01
It depends on how quickly it happens. If it is a slow decline then it will be fine. If bitcoin suddenly shits itself then the market may dip for a while.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:29:09
How will bitcoin address the extremely high electricity cost of mining? This isn't sustainable and I can see bitcoin mining actually being illegal if the energy usage gets too high. I don't see a solution to this,  anyone?
Edit: Downvoted for asking a question with terrible answers given, jesus the bitcoin community is awful now. The terrible answers here all but confirm what i thought. Bitcoin will die due to mining being banned. It will happen in China within the year i am sure. BTC replaced as number 1 crypto by 2019
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:33:26
Hmm, i think at this point that it's obvious the lightning network will make of break bitcoin and i am afraid to say i think it will be its death. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:23:22
so you want bitcoin to be like gold? Seems like a cop out when you realise gold is used in many cases other than currency. At its current progression, bitcoin mining will use more power than the entire world used today by 2020. Bitcoin holders seem to never want to address this.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:19:33
If you think POW is worse for centralization then clearly it is you who doesnt understand mining. Tell me, do you think it is harder to buy coins and stake them, or to buy expensive mining equipment to mine?
Anyone can stake their coins, only the rich can mine. You are believing lies that are fed to you by miners who have a very keen interest in keeping bitcoin POW, and it is the reason Bitcoin will soon drop from number 1.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:32:27
Down, once eth overtakes it then we will see a real plummet
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:43:17
This is only true if there are hubs with multiple connections in and out of them. This is terrible as it basically makes crypto centralized. The lightning network is dead before it begins.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:23:40
Most people dont realise that bitcoin is basically just waiting to die at this point. The lightning network failing will be the catalyst where everyone realises that bitcoin is now a shitcoin by comparison to some of the other tech we have now. It will probably cause a mini crash but i hope it happens soon.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:39:22
Lol. Bitcoiners are so deluded. It's not a spam attack it's just increasing demand and bitcoin can't cope.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:52:42
You are obviously not seeing the scale they will need to be, it isn't going to be 100 connections , it will be 5 or 6 centralization hubs connecting everybody. The coffee scenario doesn't work any other way.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:08:05
The lack of understanding shown by your comment is depressing
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:57:09
On the contrary,  I think it shows that bitcoin is a bad investment.  Mining will be banned / heavily taxed by 2020 I'm sure 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:56:15


@_date: 2017-12-30 21:44:32
I don't know if you are tech person, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you simply have not read about the lightning network. The lightning network will never work, nobody will want to use it when better alternatives already exist, and if it does catch on then all it will do is create centralization.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:50:01
Do you realise that by design,  the lightning network will basically create centralized banks for crypto ?
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:14:46
if you are going to start iffing and butting, why would you not mention something like iota. IF it does what it says, there will be no need for bitcoin at all...
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:36:47
I don't hold btc as i think it will soon be replaced
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:02:02
So you are OK with paying 20 dollars to send a transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:57:52
except you cant mine iota...
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:09:32
I have not personally  had any issues, and since the last update transactions have been quick. I can't speak for you though obviously.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:00:15
Ok, correct me if im wrong.
So if I want to transfer money to someone over the lightning network I need to have  a channel with them, or know someone who does by some degree of separation. 
Now, if I want to pay random guy x in bitcoin through the lightning network I need to find someone or some place that has a channel to him.
Everyone will be looking for an easy way to do this, and the answer to that will be for example a crypto exchange, as every user on the exchange will have a channel set up.
Now tell me, how is that any different from a bank?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:13:15
I dont think you understand iota at all. But in 5 years bitcoin will be dead as far as I'm concerned.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:02:43
And why would you not use one of the many other currencies that can do all this without the annoying requirement?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:59:39
i mean, other than as a buy in for other currencies, there is no reason for bitcoin to exist. Bitcoin is AOL. Once other coins are made into trading pairs, btc will cease to have any use case at all.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:01:37
Honestly, BTC cannot go on like this. As far as i know there is no solution so the only possible outcome is that BTC dies. I will probably get down-voted for saying this as the sub is an echo chamber, but its not sustainable economically or environmentally.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:06:00
But what happens if for example an exchange goes down? It seems to be awfully reliant on these central hubs.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:38
Honestly imo,  the next stage for crypto is the death of bit coin, or at least it's dethroning from the top spot. Once that happens I will feel much better about the crypto space as a whole as it will signify people actually appreciating the use of a coin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:37:10
My mistake, but the fact that its $5 is still terrible in comparison to instant, feeless transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:28:59
Nobody knows about iota because it is a beta that publicly released this year. I'm sure if the tech follows through then it will be just as known as bitcoin is right now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:29:42
 
that is a good video explaining the lightning network. As you can see it's fairly obvious that it will become a series of centralized hubs, i direct contrast to what crypto is meant to be.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:14:23
Im afraid i cant help you there but I would recommend binance in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:04:52
I have to say, I don't think bitcoin will be no1 market cap by 1st January 2019. And I'm not sure it will even be top 3. Once it loses number 1 status it will probably plummet down the rankings.
Edit : to clarify, i think bitcoin has 2 major problems. Scaling and sustainability. I do not think the lightning network is something that will be good for bitcoin as i feel it will end up in centralised hubs. I do not think bitcoin is sustainable while it is proof of work due to the extremely high energy usage. Feel free to correct me or change my mind.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:29:51
In the next 3 years. I think it will be knocked off number 1 by eoy
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:02:48
Man that's an article that we have all read from September. Everything there has been discussed and fixed or answered.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:15:41
The market cap falls back to whatever it was at the time you deem the mania to have started...?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:48:40
Yep. The fact that I got down voted for speaking a fact is pretty telling. People are not willing to accept that ANYTHING that uses amount of energy just to exist is unlikely to survive.  The fact that some people care more about personal gain than the environment is disgusting, but it's the reason why we are in this mess to begin with. A very American mindset
For this reason I personally believe that any crypto based on proof of work will probably not be widely adopted long run. Proof of stake and other methods such as the tangle are my bet for the future.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:47:53
And that's OK ?
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:45:56
How many people knew what bitcoin was in 2009?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:29:20
Yep, for me a currency inspired by a similar system to what iota uses would be promising (doesn't exist yet but I think it will soon) 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:49:06
Its starting to become true. When you can do (insert instant transaction coin ) to usd on bittrex, binance etc bitcoin is going to drop from number 1.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:28:36
It's inferior technology because transactions take hours and cost 20 dollars...
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:59:16
Honestly at this point, you would have to be blind or deluded to think bitcoin is going to survive. I give it another year before bitcoin is knocked from the top, and once its not the no1, it will tumble down into obscurity just like AOL did with the internet. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:45:13
Exactly the same could be said of bitcoin, much worse in fact. But I bet you own a lot of bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:46:59
Because? What can bitcoin do that another currency doesn't already do better? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:35:06
Just bear in mind that people probably said similar things about AOL, yahoo and nokia
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:48:24
Yep. I think if bitcoin doesn't sort scaling by September 2018 it will lose the top spot.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:36:53
I'm not in this to be rich, that's just a nice side effect. I'm in it for the technology, and if you know about bitcoin you know that it isn't environmentally stable and won't be allowed t continue using so much energy in mining.
Because the miners essentially own bitcoin, you know that they won't allow it to go pos. So basically bitcoin will be killed by mining.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:52:01
There are altcoins that are already capable of thousands of tx/sec...the lightning network is awful and will not take  off. That is unless you are happy with having crypto banks...
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:08:23
If you want to transfer, convert your btc to ltc and it will take about 15 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:27:36
Based on there being many alternatives that are currently technologically superior, chomping at the bit to dethrone it. The only use bitcoin currently has is that you have to first buy bitcoin to access other crypto. 
As soon as that is no longer the case it will plummet, and because tx times and fees are so bad at the moment users are being pushed to alternatives.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:47:33
Bcash is equally shit. Ripple doesn't seem like something that we want to be number 1. However I think it will still be overtaken. Normal people are already starting to realise how shit bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:01:37
You are forgetting bitcoin having hour long transaction times and fees around 20 dollars though... I would argue that is pretty broken.
