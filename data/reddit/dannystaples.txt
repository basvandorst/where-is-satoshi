The guy said it would hit $2000 in 2017. So his analysis wasn't exactly accurate!
He predicted a rise but he was a factor of ten out in the actual number prediction.
You are stretching putting you faith on this flimsy analysis.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:17:20
Not if it collapsed all together.
And you can only say that now. At the start of this week you were all on the verge of losing everything.
Now its over you think it is somehow impressive that you avoided a complete wipe out.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:35:22
Most people aren't early adopters. They just jumped on the hype train as usual.
I wasn't saying I myself lost everything, I was using it as an example.
I'm just pointing out the ridiculous mentality of holders in this situation. They will hold until their money tumbles into oblivion and still convince themselves it was the best choice.
Clearly these people have never heard of day trading or just choose to ignore it.
Holding long term is a decent plan IF the stock you are buying is RELIABLE. LONG TERM.
Like going long term in Apple, or Amazon that is a good plan. They will be here for a long long time yet and their stock is only going to go up.
It will take a long time for Apple to wither and die. They are simply too big.
Cryptocurrency though is FRAGILE. How many people think crypto is a bubble waiting to burst? After this week do you still disagree with them?
The fact is it is entirely possible that crypto currencies are going to crash completely. The only people who hold investments in potential bubbles are mental gamblers.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:29:23
Yeah sorry I should have put speech marks around it.
In fact I sold all my coins this weekend. Literally hours before the price started tumbling.
All I meant was holding your coins forever isn't impressive. Being able to say you got into Bitcoin "before it was cool" is just sad IF you don't do anything with those gains.
There is nothing to boast about having a bunch of unusable coins on a memory stick. Cashing in for a huge profit and taking your family on a massive holiday, that is something to be jealous about.
People can ignore it all they want but Bitcoin is very fragile. It may still be the mother of all bubbles that people are predicting. This week should be proof of that.
Cryptocurrency still has a chance of collapsing into nothing.
If people keep holding till that happens no one will be impressed.

Hopefully you get it back.

That's because people want to be rich and everything is easy to see in hindsight.
Ask the question "What is the next Apple?" right now in 2017 and it is impossible to answer. Which one of the unknown penny stocks in existence right now is going to inflate 10,000% over the next decade? Which one should I pour all my hard earned savings into so that I can retire at 40?
The same way people say "Man I wish I'd gone all in on Apple in the 90s.".
NO! Anyone who went all in on Apple in the 90s was fucking mental. Apple didn't even start becoming a valuable company until the iPhone came out in 2007.
In the 90s Apple was a sickly company being run by an asshole who alienated everyone he spoke to. Living in the shadow of Microsoft who was pretty much monopolising the entire computer scene.
Would YOU have gone all in on Apple in the 90s in that case? I seriously doubt it. 
Same way an unknown silicon valley startup may create the next big thing next year. No one right now is going to bet big on such a company. When most start ups give a big speech and then crash and burn.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:52:28
It doesn't have to hit zero for it to be a crash, it just has to be rapid. 
I mean how many people have lost money do you think this week? A LOT of people.
I'd say that is a crash no matter which way you look at it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:11:20
Yes but scrubbing 30% off of the profit you had a week ago is still terrible. Especially since no one knows whether you'll ever get it back again.
Getting in early should be a GOOD thing. But it isn't worth crap all if you don't actually gain from it.
Otherwise what was the point of beating everyone else to the punch?
I got into Bitcoin in 2013 COULD have made loads of money but I waited too long and lost most of it. That just makes you look dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:34:11
Yeah getting out while you still have something to lose is pathetic. Whatever.
It is easy to pass judgement in hindsight. If it was still dropping I bet this post wouldn't be here though. Now THAT is pathetic.
Not to mention you will probably be waiting several months just to recuperate those loses you made yesterday.
If you know, it doesn't crash again.
Staying in doesn't make you smart or intelligent it just makes you a stubborn gambler.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:38:21
Why not sell it, wait for it to bottom out then buy back in? 
If it crashes all together you're early adoption will have been for nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:59:48
Because Crypto currencies value is imaginary.
Why does one Bitcoin which exists as nothing more than a few 0s and 1s on the internet cost $15,000?
A car costs that much and that is a complex machine made of metal and glass.
One dollar has its value because of the things you can buy with it. In my country at least you can't buy anything with Bitcoin.
Therefore its price will rocket and drop based on hype.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:16:05
What you think going long in one of the richest companies in existence is bad?
You know Apple has BILLIONS in the bank right? Like money that is just stock piled abroad that isn't used for anything except paying off debt and research and development.
Just because you don't like their phones doesn't make them a bad investment. Not when they still sell MILLIONS of phones every year.
One day Apple will fall but it won't be soon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:47:57
I'll buy back in when there is a proper sell infrastructure in place.
Right now it is woefully inadequate. Been waiting for Coinbase to verify my bank account for nearly a week. Now there is a good chance Coinbase will be closed down for insider trading.
I send them more personal information about me than I've sent to any company ever and they still can't make a basic payment into my bank account.
There is a good chance someone is making a forged drivers licence and passport with my identity on it right now and they can't even send me the money I'm owed.
It's turned me right off crypto. It's too easy to buy in and way too difficult to cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:14:38
The entire point of being early is to actually CAPITALISE on the advantage you've given yourself.
They are too timid to actually invest big in something and yet still lord over everyone like they are superior.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:30:15
Unfortunately I've found this out myself these past couple of days. It really is a joke.
I have about £200 worth. That inflated to about £400. Which was great right up till the point I tried to sell it.
CoinBase first decided that they would never verify my bank details. Which was a joke in the first place since it is some shady bank account in Estonia. Which required me to send THEM money to verify, which cost me about £15 in Euro conversion fees at my bank. Which has yet to happen.
So I converted my money back into Bitcoin and tried to sell it on an external site. Which is currently stuck in limbo because of the ridiculous methods that Bitcoin employs to send these funds.
So I'm pissing money away in transaction fees left right and centre only for my coins to just end up stuck in the aether.
I am out. Cryptocurrency can go f*** itself. When a reputable company like VISA get on board and they cut out the crap I will think about getting back on but not until.
The system is simply too unstable and unreliable to be viable.
All I'm going to say is if I lose my £400 I will be very pissed off but I am SOOOO glad I didn't buy any more.
Holy sh*t what a mess.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:40:25
You didn't know anything with certainty. If you really think that you are fucking delusional.
It is EASY to say that now in hindsight. 
If you knew it wasn't going to be final why didn't you sell your coins and then buy back after the dip? That would have yielded you a significant profit and you'd be laughing right now.
No the fact is you sat there watching the price fall and then when it stopped going down your confirmation bias kicked in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:24:49
It's IMPOSSIBLE to predict the market. 
You can crunch data till you crumble into dust it won't make any difference.
So I keep it simple. The same simple logic that made me sell my Bitcoin this weekend hours before the price plummeted.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:35:50
Being early is overrated. The right time to buy is when it starts going back up again. You just have to hope it doesn't go up too fast.
Always assume that the trend is going to continue in that direction until you see otherwise. THEN go for it.
People always want to be that one guy who went all in on a $0.04 stock and made billions. The problem is most $0.04 stocks become $0.00 stocks.
This could very well be the end for Bitcoin. Instead of a bubble burst it might be a slow bubble deflate. You can gamble on that if you want to but I don't want any part of it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:34:02
Because you've massively over estimated the cost of electricity and under estimated how much you can mine.

That means that ASIC is better, but why does that make regular hardware worthless?

Yeah but that is what I'm saying. The fact that is a legal hit in American Football is baffling to me.
Just looks like a free for all.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:03:59
Is there no rule about which direction you can get hit from in American football?
That's just fucking ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:49:12
Well this would be very unlikely to happen in Rugby because you can't pass forwards. So that catch wouldn't be legal in the first place.
It's set up completely different. The guy with the ball wouldn't to be facing that direction.
Everything happens towards the goals. So that is generally the direction of the tackles as well.
Now I've watch this a few times it is starting to make more sense.
It's just I've never really watched NFL and it surprised me. I'm too used to the strict rules in Rugby.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:57:08
It's just I used to play Rugby and this would probably have got him sent off.
I mean it's no wonder American footballers are all brain dead.
