If you can’t google “distinguish”, I most certainly doubt your financial literacy.

Barr quoted “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” Why doesn’t the report exonerate the President?
Did you miss that part?

I’m not making any claims that a crime was committed. I’m disputing the claim that the President can fire the FBI Director for any reason.
Firing the director can definitely be used to cover up a crime. It sends a clear message to the agency that anyone that continues an unwanted investigation will risk their job (and pension).
I guess you aren’t too familiar with what happened with Nixon. Though he didn’t fire his FBI Director, he fired his AG that was investigating him.

Obstruction of Justice?????? There is a huge part of the report dealing with the evidence for and against obstruction.

Here is the email chain on Wikileaks:

The report plainly says that it does not exonerate the President on obstruction of justice. That’s why we should want to see what it says. I just want all the facts, don’t you?
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:30:31


Yes. It literally says Barr’s summary that Mueller gathered evidence for the case for obstruction and has left it up to the AG/Congress to decide if the President committed it or not. The AG has stated that he believes that Trump did not, but I believe that it is in the public interest for all the facts in the report to be made public.


A lack of evidence that he obstructed Justice. If the 400 page report has zero evidence of obstruction, then okay, but Barr’s own summary says the report does not exonerate the President, which implies something is in the report.

You need me to provide you with hard evidence of Assange denying that Russia gave Wikileaks the emails.....? Or that he was a regular contributor on RT? Or that Roger Stone is being prosecuted right now for lying about being the go between for the Trump campaign and Wikileaks....?
You’re head is that far in the sand?

The President isn’t aggressively pushy?
“Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’ Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend — and maybe someday that will happen!”

I was disputing this claim. The President cannot dismiss the FBI Director to cover up a crime - we both agree on that.
The Mueller investigation looked into whether or not the President did this. While the Special Counsel doesn’t “draw a conclusion - one way or the other – as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved. The report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, but it doesn’t exonerate him either. What in the report doesn’t exonerate the President?

Ah, you're ignorant of the impeachment process of a President. 
The Justice Department isn't allowed to charge a sitting President with a crime. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel adopted this policy in an internal memo, and that has remained the policy to this day. The special counsel is an extension of the Justice Department and is bound by the same rules, therefore Mueller cannot say that Trump committed obstruction.
Furthermore, the only government body that can charge a sitting President is Congress, and that is done using a process called impeachment. Impeachment starts in the House of Representatives by a vote, and results in an investigation/evaluation of the evidence against the President to see if they should be charged for “high crimes and misdemeanors” (i.e. breaking the Oath of Office or any laws). If the House votes that the President should be charged, then they face a trial in the Senate, which decides if they should be removed from office.
The investigation by the House and the trial in the Senate both need to be a fair and without bias. Had Mueller charged the President with obstruction, that would be biasing both the potential congressional investigation and trial, which by definition is an an unfair trial.
So Mueller is bound by a Justice Department policy and the Constitution of the United States when it comes to how he presents the evidence gathered in the investigation.
From the report, the President took no issue with Russia interfering with American electoral process because it helped him, and when that was coming out, he tried to bury it. That’s what you can conclude from Part 1 of the report. The President did not conspire or coordinate with Russia, but he was aware of what Russia was up to and did nothing about it, because they helped him win in 2016. From the second part of the report, we know that he was freaking out when the truth started to come out, then he tried to cover it up by firing the special counsel multiple times, pressuring people in his circle to lie under oath, and firing anyone that wouldn't do either of those things. That’s your guy. That’s who you support. That who you think will win in 2020.
I guess it depends how much he lets Russia help him again?

To be clear. You believe that Seth Rich stole emails from a DNC server, and then also performed a successful phishing attack on Podesta, and those two events are more likely to be performed by him than a Russian intelligence operation? Even though there is zero evidence that Seth Rich did any of that, and a ton of evidence that the Russians did?


That would depend on the intent. I sincerely doubt that Russia had America’s best intentions at heart when they released those emails.

“The evidence we obtained about the President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were to make a traditional prosecutorial judgement. At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.”
The report does not exonerate Trump. It lays out plenty of evidence that he obstructed justice, and Mueller left it to congress to do something about it. Thoughts?

Can the President fire the FBI director in an attempt to cover up a crime?
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:12:03
Russia trying to get him out of the UK, his vehement denial that Russia was behind the DNC/Podesta emails (and implied it was Seth Rich), Wikileaks was coordinating with the Trump campaign via Roger Stone, Assange was hosting a show on RT...
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:47:19
By that logic, why should anyone listen to the President?
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:45:54
I never said Seth Rich was a Russian agent...?
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:02:13
Seth Rich makes more sense than a government sponsored intelligence operation? 
The Podesta emails show that he fell for a phishing attack, and that’s how the emails got hacked. You think Seth Rich was behind the phishing attack?
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:41:53
You know what would resolve our dispute? Seeing the report.
@_date: 2019-04-20 04:09:29
He obstructed Justice.... it’s clear in the report that his motivation for trying to fire the special counsel was because he was afraid of what they’d uncover.....
