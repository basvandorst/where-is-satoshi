Ha! I love that you guys think I’m some shill or something. I have been with bitcoin from the beginning because I’m a libertarian, and all the libertarians i follow were shouting about bitcoin since 2011. Because I was around for the fork means on some programmer or something? I honestly don’t even know the right term to use. I had to fly to LA just to get help from a friend just to make sure I had BTH when it forked. I wanted to make sure I could sell it immediately to buy more BTC which is exactly what I did. The fork wasn’t that long ago. Go look at my account, I barely even participate in crypto subs. It’s flattering you guys think I’m smart enough to be hired by Roger to shill bcash.

Do they accept crypto? Shame if they don’t!

I never said BTH was the original bitcoin. I simply said there is an argument there that makes sense to an amateur like me.
From an amateurs perspective, listening to both side ms of the argument, I can see where there coming from.
I’m not a programmer, I grow weed for a living.

He didn’t attract me. I’ve never once bought BCH. During the fork, my buddy in LA helped me get my coins in the right wallet so I could get my BCH, and I sold 90% of it over a few months. Yes I’ve held onto some because why not? There is. It way for me to confirm what either side is saying. I really try my hardest to learn, and be informed, but it’s so much to take in, and everyone seems so smart it’s overwhelming.

You are the second person to recommend it to me. I heard they had a mobile version but I couldn’t find it for IOS. Is it only on Android right now?

Of course I’m reported. My very first time EVER participating in the BTC vs BTH debate and which side reports me? 
I’ve literally stuck by BTC from the beginning. When we forked, I sold 90% of my BTH right away, and held onto a little to leverage. When I finally got my step dad to purchase crypto, I sent him to BTC, NOT BCH. I’m not smart enough to participate in the block size debate l, I can only comment on my user experience and you guys call me a liar, and try to get me blocked. 
Go look at my user history, I’ve never even commented in r/BTC and I’ve laughed at Roger for years. I say one thing you guys don’t agree with and you try to have me kicked out. Nice.
You guys are doin a great job at driving me away.

Ok, make them change the logo then. De-listing it is completely different thing. Then there is always the argument that BCH is closer to original bitcoin than BTC. As a novice, it seems closer to me. 
For the record, I hold 10x more BTC than I do BCH, and I have faith in the lightning network. But I’m gonna go to what gives me, as a novice the best user experience.
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:37:21
Everything but BTC should be de-listed then right? 
Then you don’t have to produce an actual peer to peer cash system to

I’ve been buying crypto for a while. I call myself a novice because I don’t understand the technical side enough to comment on the block size debate. I don’t know what the answer is, and I generally lean towards thinking the lightning network will eventually work, and make BTC what it was advertised to me as. Should I call myself an expert because I’ve been around for a while? 
Yeah, they bought the account to shill BTH, but then spend hours every single day commenting and posting in non crypto subs just for this one chance to post in r/bitcoin. 
Who is posting in music subs, weed subs, and r/exmorman every single day. Is that part of their grand conspiracy? I have been active in other subs almost every day since this account was made two years ago. Take a look. This is my first time EVER participating in the BTC vs BTH debate. I have nothing to hide. 
Is that how a shill account works? I wouldn’t know.

Thank you! Someone who isn’t rude as hell to me! 
I’ll be honest, the last time I sent BTC was in February when I sold some steem through block trades, and sent it to Kraken. Yes it took hours.
Last time I sold BTH(because I sell my BCH when I need money, and hold my BTC) it was close to instant. 
Most of my experience moving bitcoin over the last year or so, has been only to trade other coins for it to sell. I’m not planning on selling any of my BTC for a long time.

Because it takes an hour and costs me $5.
