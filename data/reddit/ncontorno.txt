Why so hostile? I'm being serious.

Sorry, but the quote is incorrect.

So you feel posting an image with an incorrect quote is appropriate?

No, that does not.
That device is called a MagicBand. The only thing stored on it is the band's individual identification number. The only thing a person will get from reading it is a string of letters and numbers.
The actual data is stored in a secured server. Once the band is read at an appropriate touch point, the server will send back only the information it needs to provide its function. If you are using it for charging (after entering your pin number for confirmation), it only will charge your hotel account. Your credit card, name, address, etc. is not transmitted at all.

Thank you! I just got into bitcoins recently (like yesterday) and am finding all of it very interesting (and addicting!). I was browsing and saw a photo that looked very familiar and just wanted to set the record straight.
If you (or anyone else for that matter) are interested, back when this program was first announced, a Congressman sent [a public letter -PDF WARNING-]( to Disney CEO Bob Iger. He basically blasted Disney about privacy concerns. Iger responded with a well-worded ['wtf are you talking about' letter]( Made me kinda proud to work for that guy.
