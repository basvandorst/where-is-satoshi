The difference is that Dutch people generally like their government and economy.  They didn't let them gradually bend the citizens over a rail like the Americans did.

Okay, but just to play devil's advocate for a minute here... so are police departments.  There are police departments all over the US that get away with really shady or even criminal shit, some of them even act like a legal version of the mob.
But my response to that isn't "TEAR DOWN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT!  NO MORE POLICE!" - I still want police, I just want to fix the corruption within the departments.
I still want financial regulations and a government too.

We talking about the same socially democratic governments here? Because that's a pretty good description of the opposite of what they are.

Can't the filthy rich just hide all their money in bitcoin to evade taxes now?  So that they don't even *need* to buy politicians.

They couldn't form a single unified voice, and were insistent on going leaderless and direct-democratic, which resulted in yeah, pretty much every problem in the world, or at least the western world, being protested at the same time.

Oh sort of the same reason how megablox are "lego" and magic cards are "pokemon" and every gun is an AK-47 and every plane is a Boeing 747, just one of those things the media does.

So Bitcoin is about end corruption/tackle racism/fight police brutality/treat natives better/make my neighbor pick up his dog poop/someone is stealing books from the communist's library?

Well, when you're right 51% of the time, you're wrong 49% of the time!
