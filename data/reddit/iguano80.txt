The thing is Bitcoin is a currency, and is widely used.Is going to be viable as a world currency with the help of new technologies on top of the blockchain. The people who split the chain, because they didn't have the consensus at that point want you to believe that bitcoin cannot reach the status of the world currency unless everyone follow what they want, and there is the lie.
If they wanted to change the main chain, they needed the consensus of the community, this is not a dictatorship, that is why BCH and BSV are basically dead chains, with less than 5% of the market and hashpower. they didn't have the consensus, they wanted to force the change because personal interest. If you see the background of the people behind this, are all millionaires, they don't want to change the status quo, because THEY are the status quo.
We don't need misleading people infecting with hate this reddit, that is why some posts are being deleted.

I'm seeing your message... without being down-voted like in other places...
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:50:15
In which country are you?
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:38:10
or maybe changed BTC to BCH at 0.5btc each
@_date: 2019-07-24 09:23:06
I have questions about this...
How we going to maintain the monetary policy (21million) if the amount of money is not public?
I mean, right now anyone can count the amount of money in circulation, if you remove the amount from the transactions i think is not going to be possible , someone can create somehow more bitcoin from the thin air and because the amount are going to be hided, how we can validate? or how we can avoid double spending, or things like that.
Also, this is possible with softforks? or we are going to hardfork for this?
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:57:16
I'm asking this because I have my cold wallet saved only with 12 words, and now I feel is insecure in the long term.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:38:03
Are you sure satoshi is a human?

Here the transaction on the blockchain
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:02:59
Yes, I'm afraid ...
but i read it depends of the miner... :(
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:22:51


do you think 12 word seeds are insecure?
@_date: 2018-09-28 17:15:37
Thank you very much! :)
@_date: 2018-09-28 21:40:50
Guys the transaction got confirmed!!!
It's time to pay less fee :)
@_date: 2018-09-28 17:25:49
Why here the transaction have different measure of thee fee,
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:01:40
His wallet change the address every time he do a transaction that is why the to outputs are directed to different addresses 
The is a normal behavior to increase privacy, and it works i see how the people get confused
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:09:57
yes i mean, i can wait until the mempool get empty,
My question is if there is a minimum fee
@_date: 2018-09-28 18:08:13
For this transaction i used coinomi who has full support to   bech32 addresses,
For the PC I use Electrum for the same reason.
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:59:48
dude, it clearly says...

@_date: 2019-11-06 20:34:59
These guys showed their holdings on the blockchain? or they are just playing with imaginary bitcoins? if that the case, this is BAD very very BAD!

I was banned because I was explaining how the LN works.
All bcash community is fake

what this means?
@_date: 2018-10-09 13:15:58
Venezuelan no living in Venezuela here,
Its weird because all my friends there are saving money in BTC, but they are afraid of buying and selling stuff in BTC,
Some of them are mining so they don't want to looks suspicious using BTC on the street,
But at the same time you have people like in local bitcoin who are using Bitcoin in public,
I'm pretty sure is happening more and more,  more people are losing the fear.
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:47:07
Yes exactly for now, it will be changes for sure, the adoption will dictate these changes
right now you can send transactions paying only 1sat/byte which is almost free, with the actual utilization of segwit the network can handle twice the amount of transaction it could manage on December 2017, 
even lightning network is not needed at the moment, so we have different solutions on the works,
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:50:15
Exactly, that is why the block still 1mb + segwit, the miners decided
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:06:20
Bitcoin Core is the name of the implementation, also the main group of devs who develop this implementation use this name, the name of the network is bitcoin, also the name of the coin, i don't know exactly which one you are referencing when you say "bitcoin core".
To me, is not about faith, is about market, about hashpower and adoption,
We can have faith in whatever we like, but the world will keep moving forward.
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:42:18
Segwig is now in almost 50% of all the transactions, also the big players are using transaction in batch more, this happened because with time, and the fear of high fees, the people looked more efficient alternatives of how to use the blockchain,
In the future will be other things, off-chain transactions and compressed address who will take less and less space on the blockchain,
If you implement big blocks right away the people will keep using inefficient ways of use the blockchain, and in the near future you will have a hundred terabyte blockchain that nobody will download and the centralization of the nodes will be the reality that we are trying to avoid.
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:03:23
the people who use bitcoin is because the security, privacy, deflacionary monetary policy, border-less and unstoppable transactions, independence from government and financial institution and others...  
The fees? cash fees are 0, cheaper than bch.   
Do you really want a decentralized network, with different hardware, bandwith and locations behave as visa? and for free? go yourself and download the blockchain, do the test for yourself, see how long it take to download and validate all the transactions, I mean the initial process easily take one week on a developed country using 30mbits connection. imagine if someone in Africa wants to run their own node with 1mb bandwith... imagine a miner in Africa try to download a 32mbyte block every 10 minutes and validate it, imagine a miner in africa trying to propagate a  32mb block faster than a miner in Germany in order to not be an orphan block.
and then you say, nodes are for big company, and fast internet connections..
what is the point of having a network where the poor country depends on the rich countries to operate? we already have that...
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:23:00
Guys I just bought from [joltfun.com](  
Great site, super fast, cheap, LN in all its splendor!!!  
Fees = 13 sat, I guess I used a lot of routing because usually is 0
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:17:09
Soon I will connect with your node, just tried to say that the routing is working as it should :D.
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:53:21


This is a lie, LN is an open protocol, nobody can stop you to use it, you can establish channels with who ever you want, you don't need a central authority approval to do so, you don't need a central hub to exchange bitcoin with another node. is permissionless and it can be even more private than the blockchain.  
I use it everyday, fees cheaper than any blockchain, faster than any blockchain. after you start to use it, is the payment of choice if the merchant give you the option.  
After you use it you understand why other crypto users hate it so much....
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:10:20






@_date: 2019-08-16 06:39:57
I'm using LN often, I love it, Is clear that is the future for small payments.
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:51:06
You need to change rolling average on the bottom of the graph to 1 day, instead of 7.
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:56:23
well one year later we are at 60%... not bad...

Hi, I have the expertise with bitcoind nodes and lnd nodes, if you need help on that, just PM.
There are plugins to manage  payments on the Lightnint Network without need of installing the BTCPay Server. but in any-case, a BTCpay Server is an excellent option.
Share with us your result please!
(ignore bitpay)

This is my worst nightmare...
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:18:33
I'm pretty sure you are trading pokemon bch lol, go and use your deform idea of 100 petabyte blockchain in two main servers. that's what roger ver told you, I cannot change that...
like i said even, Satoshi spoke about the use of escrow for certain transactions, also he mention of the use of payment channel... all of this to maximize the efficiency of the blockchain...Hal Finney also suggest the use of custodial mechanism in the future, even for holding...
Again, not all the transactions need to be on the bitcoin blockchain, is hard to explain this to non technical people.
@_date: 2019-08-19 12:38:41

You are open to believe whatever you like my friend, I had some BCH some time ago... not now.
If you want cheaper transactions, just use LN ,0 fee is better than 1c.
Good luck!
@_date: 2019-08-19 01:32:30
dude... hal finney, nick szabo, and satoshi nakamoto himself said several times, that not all the transaction needs to be on the blockchain....stop reading lies bcasher...
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:04:54
I guess we need some people spending some sats, in order to give Bitcoin an anchor on the real life value of the things.   
And the point of LN is to buy everyday coffees right?
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:15:43
They are not, not all the transactions need to be immutable and guaranteed ,

Well is impossible to be 100% clear unless no one is using it.
But if you check the transaction per month.  
[  
Since June 2019, the network is managing more transactions than December 2017, and honestly I paid for my last 10 or more transaction 1 sat/b... to me that's pretty clear...
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:31:50
BTW my node is not directly connected to bitrefill
@_date: 2019-08-05 12:41:31
the problem with bcash is that is declining in utilization and value.   
At the moment of the fork the value was almost 1/4 of a bitcoin, and now is less than 3%.
@_date: 2019-08-16 01:29:26
Now you need to try a LN node, your brain is going to explode after you make some transactions!

@_date: 2019-08-23 14:33:20
Interesting question...
I find the community very toxic, I got banned just because I was defending LN, two week later I saw them celebrating  for the implementation of their own layer two scaling solution, pretty similar to LN... This is just an example of what happen there...The creation of the coin itself, I mean, is a fork and OK, it can happen, but try to scam newcomers telling them that BCH is bitcoin, or another coin, doesn't mater, i find it terrible. I mean, you are playing with the ignorance to take the money from other for personal benefit, this is a scam.
Technically.... wow, that's the worst part, they are using the hash algorithm of another coin (Bitcoin) who have 97% of the hashrate, this create a very hostile environment for the users of this coin, honestly anyone who put their savings on this coin lost his mind. There are reports who says the cost of 51% attacks can be as low as 25k USD, in fact, some reports says that this kind of attack already happened and did some changes on recent transactions...Also the centralization, there is information that 70% of the nodes are on alibaba cloud service, and other 15% or so is on AWS. this is insane, and is against all logic of a decentralized coin. In fact old cypherpunks as Nick Szabo report this level of centralization very publicly.
If you want a prove of what I'm saying, they are not hard to find. I invite you to find it for your self, and create your own opinion of why they are losing the market, and they will continue to do so.
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:11:01
the people who know to use the tools properly doesn't need to ask where i find it...
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:15:24
Yes, in fact I notice, you need to wait few hours, in order to let the network see your channels and route your pays properly, but after that, is flawless.
What I'm doing is open channels in weekend at 1 sat/b and give time to the network to replicate them. then I forget to pay fees forever.
@_date: 2019-08-08 21:19:30
well is open source, with it you can use bech32 addresses on the trezor, and honestly, I hate to use a web browser as a wallet.

uh? you can use bitcoin in several ways, all the transaction doesn't need to be on the blockchain,

The problem with the people is that they don't really understand what they are buying...
You want best payment system? the fastest? the most accepted? what the fuck are you looking into crypto? you want a decentralized network of thousands of nodes with different hardware, location and bandwidth behave as paypal mainframe... go and buy lies my friend, but the market will teach you a lesson...
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:53:52
weird i can see it on blockchair
@_date: 2019-08-07 08:35:30
When you try to explain this on (honestly in good faith). The answers are pretty nuts.
They really believe that bcash in some kind of deform Phoenix will reborn from the ashes and take the market and hashrate from Bitcoin.
Honestly the propaganda techniques bitcoin.com are using on these people are pretty scary and effective.
@_date: 2019-08-19 01:51:01
We still going there, The block is bigger because of segwit and second layer solutions like LN are working better and better, 
More and more websites are using it. I'm very confident for the future...
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:29:52
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:47:54

no, can you explain?
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:44:17
Beautiful words... now lets check some reality...
Utilization:  
[ \- 90% of merchant utilization on Australia.  
    -  less than 10% of TPS on blockchain (if we add LN transaction the difference is higher, btw 1 hour block confirmation). 3% of price and hashrate
[ 4460 LN nodes
[ 9560 Bitcoin Core nodes.
[ 1433 BCH nodes  
[ \- over 90% of dominance of the whole market...  
development?? lol: compare the githubs by yourself...
[  
Dude, the reality is that BCH needs 100kb blocks, no more (there will be some empty blocks dough) ... take your money out of it...
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:00:23
60 confirmation is completely immutable
@_date: 2019-08-23 16:37:46
well, it was an spike...
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:48:08
They cannot cancel it even after 1 confirmation.
@_date: 2019-08-09 02:20:00
yes you need to create another wallet with bech32 address format
@_date: 2019-10-18 17:29:38
You are kind of ok! :D
Is just that turbochannels are not premade, the funds are available to use without the confirmation wait time, that's all, I think this is going to be used a lot.
And for the watchtowers, if you DON'T trust at all the node you create the channel with AND if you are not going to use the wallet for more than 10 days is good idea to have one. 
But if you'll open the wallet once every-week, you are ok, you don't need anything else. even if you don't open the wallet in months but the node who are you connected don't want to steal your money you also are ok.(kind of the same as use watch-towers I think).
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:54:28
Pre-opened channels?
pay for watchtowers?
are you sure you know how this works??
@_date: 2019-10-11 18:21:09
it is important :)
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:31:44
Well, The reasons of this are hard to know
Some say that few companies still spamming the network with non segwit transactions... and that's the reason why segwit utilization still less than 50%.
Maybe they stopped the spam for one day. who knows...
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:06:16
it happens all the time? 
I think you are not well informed.
@_date: 2019-08-06 19:15:28
well, it looks like if you got one confirmation is because your block is part of the blockchain, after that it cannot be rejected.  
you can correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:11:31
my first tip! :D
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:14:52

pretty awesome! no fees at all!

this one is pretty cheap, is just to test!
@_date: 2019-10-20 16:10:47
The blockchain is getting bigger and bigger,
The cost of having a node is increasing.
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:23:38
Lightning is so amazing! I cant believe how fast it is
Can someone try on this one, I will send the money back!
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:02:28
tell me about your experience...
@_date: 2019-09-30 00:53:20
The default fee on LND for example is 1sat per transaction. That's what I have in my node.
Some routing nodes don't charge fee.
Don't know the reason.
Also if the final node has a channel with your node (no routing), the fee is always 0
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:17:39
To be usable it has to have value
@_date: 2019-09-30 14:55:03
i give you this one hahaha,
have to work no time for fighting.
btw, I use my nodes on blockchain and lightning, just to let you know that im not willing to lose the control over my funds, it just that i guess not everybody need to think same as me.
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:05:17
lightning is more used now than bch  
more nodes, more liquidity.  
imagine when it become easy ;)
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:51:14
I pay 1 sat/b to create my channels...
The fees on the LN can be as low as 0...
I have everything beautiful connected to my zap interface. I can do payments from my node at home no matter where I’m.
I’m being honest with you, you can sell that BS elsewhere... not here.
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:30:08
Sorry pal, no one use bch, is just roger with his fake transactions and his acolytes , just move on on that pls
More nodes = more trusted third parties???
WTF!!! Man nothing to discuss here...
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:20:03
Weird, lately I'm using lightning more than the blockchain, and is working just fine, If you are not techie I suggest you to use a custodial wallet like bluewallet.
Zap wallet is going to release very soon a full LN node for the phone, all with graphical interface, maybe you can test again when that happens.
@_date: 2019-09-29 23:10:46
bitcoin has more transaction per month now than in 2017...the blocks are bigger now, there are second layer solutions in use, also private networks are more used.
the narrative that bitcoin in 2017 was more used than today is a complete BS my friend.
@_date: 2019-09-30 18:53:58
I got banned too :D
About banks. (philosophical answer) : I don't think all services from banks are bad, what is bad is the power they have, and the abuse of use of the fractional reserve mechanism.  
Bitcoin give us the power to bypass banks, but sadly a lot of people is comfortable with the use of banks, if you want to fight that, you already lose, I don't see this behaviour changing in our lifetime.  
This is why, is not crazy to give a chance to some custodial wallets and services. Which I personally don't use.
Now, you can down-vote me to the oblivion... bye :P
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:03:06

But if you come here comparing protocols with the banking system... dude that’s not a good start, I will retaliate.
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:47:11
yes i find this overwhelming too.
You can use it in a "normal" way but is still nice to have the options.
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:15:42
Yes, I find this a big step forward on the right direction.
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:28:12
Don’t feel sorry for me ;)
Dude I don’t know if you are reading... LN IS Working! I use it every day!
Look... If you like to trust roger ver and his lies that’s ok, but is imposible you can sell that BS to people who is using the technology.
Like I said before there is nothing to discuss here , I’m using LN with my own node to buy real stuff online, fees are cheaper than bch and is faster (no confirmation needed).
No matter what you say you can’t overcome that reality my friend...
Btw I was banned from for defend LN, I see people there believing BS without no way to crack the bubble roger created for them. Feel sorry for those guys.

Like I said, we are not there, that’s the objective.
Remember that some people bought at 1$ or 10$ or 100$ and for them is time to spend...

It can be as low as 0

I think you are not reading what I'm saying...
i guess you prefer to use rogers nodes and trust him... good luck with that pal.

Really? 
1.- You will have the money ready to spend on the LN.
2.-  It is not custodial,  your LN node will be in your phone, this means that you will have control of the keys of the node .
3.- It creates a channel, as a user you don’t need to worry about the technical part anymore .

Maybe the upvotes are for the other part of the message don’t you think?
Sometimes when the people don’t know about computers like you custodial can be a safer solution.
Anyways, I use LND as Bitcoin nodes and that’s the way should be for everyone, is the way I highly suggest you to use your bitcoin.

Dude this is a long conversation to have.
If you believe in a future where all transactions of all the people in the world can be placed on the blockchain (we are talking about 8 billion people at the moment) that’s ok I’m not going to argue with you about that.
But I don’t believe that’s is a rational way to grow this technology , I believe we need to create better ways and more efficient ways to use the blockchain, and those ways can be hard to use now but we need to develop them now to have them easy to use in the future. 
If you think that a blockchain with almost no use (only propaganda and fake transactions from a millionaire who force all the business who work with him to use his coin) is the future, that’s ok.
I wish you the best, I hope both ideas find the best outcome.

Bluewallet is becoming one of the best on-chain wallets, let alone the lightning capabilities.
@_date: 2019-09-30 14:00:12
Dude, seriously , you have no clue how this works.
Good luck.
@_date: 2019-09-22 10:09:51
Dude the objective is not use fiat anymore, we are not there but we need to get there some how , your proposal makes no sense
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:17:55
Yes they are, When I see what these great devs are doing, I feel so unintelligent honestly.

What about Exodus? You can have your private key with this wallet but I don't know if is online or offline wallet
