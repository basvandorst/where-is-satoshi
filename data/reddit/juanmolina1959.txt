Hello, good morning community BITCOIN.
I always have time to read the comments of the day on everything related to Bitcoin, many are very interesting and I leave a valuable learning, other comments not so much.
Always or very often I read this question:
What is happening to the price, why is it going down?
my very personal response that I do not have the gift of truth is:
What is happening and what is happening in this new adoption is the day in which most people are in the market with the sole purpose of earning dollars. investors in the medium or long term.
This is the dynamic that has been most vigorously since December 17, 2017.
the Bears vs the Bulls, that does not exist, it's a lie, if you're a trader you're the bear and the bull, it's you and the kilometers of merchant worldwide that go down the bitcoin looking for short winnings, something I do not see anything Of bad, that is very normal for the human being, to make money with his effort.
What I can not keep buying, selling short and thinking that I am the only one, besides that the bears conspire on my person avoiding you to have the best profits, I can not fool myself because the bear is myself and as well as me miles and miles of people all over the planet.
that to begin with, after commenting something that is not original of my person but that can be a solution to make the effective and common use of Bitcoin.
Happy day, my respects to all.
