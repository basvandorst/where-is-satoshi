Corrupt crony capitalism yes, not true free market capitalism.  When a company got too big and bloated a lean start would come eat its lunch.  We have had bureaucrats taking money to pass laws to create so much compliance a smaller competitor can’t afford to comply.

If you watch this and can’t understand that everything can be like this, including digital items online... you’re just not thinking.  
  
But it will be fought hard because the current way (credit cards) is a cash cow and tracking system.  
  
For example most new cars can already “see.”  I’d like to see a wallet in the car infotainment and when approaching toll plazas the car can read an invoice whether visually with qr like this or by rf somehow, then send to that address.  When the cars wallet is low it will let you know to refill.  The current Raytheon transponder system and toll-by-plate system we have in Florida is a tracking system.  They even just required it on our beach to “increase the flow of traffic.”  $1 for a 2 axel car with sunpass.  $3.50 if you don’t join their program and use toll-by-plate.  Hmmmmm they really want to know who is going where.

Its all part of the plan.  Its how they create income inequality and divide the country.  When everyone is mad at one another its easier to take more control.  The big guys sell take all the profit driving prices so far down it becomes a crisis.  Then fed has to make more money with QE to "stimulate".  Then once the stock market is again reaching all time highs, they sell and take all the profits again.  Most the money the average Joe and his 401k put in is gone.  The printing devalues the money for the average person but the bigs have so much it doesn't matter.  Then they say we need more and more regulation to stop this from happening again which only makes it harder for anyone else to play in the financial space and the big guys stay in control, don't get in trouble and are in cahoots with the fed and politicians.  Its a rigged game and you can't play.

@_date: 2014-10-17 00:05:59
You need to get on the phone with them somehow and persuade a rep to send your bitcoins to another address.  Don't lay down and take that.  Use the powers of persuasion to hit their soft spot.  It's worth a shot.  Over 1 Bitcoin is too much to sit and watch those crooked bankers and governments take from you because they're strong arming the exchange.  If I were you, I'd get it out of them and get it to BTC-E.  I have the most confidence in them to not to bend over to government, but then again who knows, this is a crazy game we're playing.  DONT LET THEM GET THAT COIN!

Buy a ton of land and pay property taxes on it and not do anything with it?  Or sell it down the road and still don't buy a nice truck and car for your wife just keep handing it over to financial advisors so they can make money to have nice stuff, so you can die and will it out to your ungrateful good for nothing grandkids, sounds like a pretty shitty life.

Do you think it could be possible that boomers didn’t constantly spend small fortunes on Starbucks and the latest iDevice and subscription boxes?  They didn’t have xbox, Netflix and YouTube to waste the best years of their life with.  They didn’t paint their hair unnatural colors, get tattoos everywhere and put holes in their face then wonder why they can’t get a job outside of retail and fast food.  They had to work and provide for themselves and their families if they chose to have one, there was no welfare til the 60s.  If they didn’t, they died.  They didn’t go to college if their family couldn’t afford it.  They learned how to do something and pimped it to make their money AND a living.  Millennials don’t even know if they’re a man or a woman.  Source: am a millennial.  It’s not a pie, there is plenty for everyone.  If you feel Bitcoin is a hedge against low wages, good for you, buy or mine some.  But quit spouting this divisive identity politics bullshit.

EDIT: And by your instant down vote I can tell that you think you're better than everyone else.  So smart, so full of virtue.  You know how to make everything perfect, everyone needs to listen to you.  But somehow, everyone is equal (but you're just a little smarter and better).

Ok forget Robinson and UK for a minute.  I am white male from Florida.  Florida has become a war torn area.  The leaders started shit, we got invaded by foreign military and I need to get my family out.  Me and all those like me who want to do the same decide we are going to migrate to a better place.  We are going to seek refuge in Malaysia.  The Malaysian government agree to allow us to come and show up by a few million.  So the 24 million Malaysians are now 27 million.  We have nothing but the clothes on our back.  We can't work, we don't know the language or the culture so the government will help us out and give us a basic income i.e. welfare.  This sounds great!  Its about helping people.  
  
Ya know, this Malaysian culture isn't really what I'm used to at home.  Im here too god damn it, I want things to be familiar.  The people's culture here is just not right.  I want the government to put my Christian churches up so we have a place to worship.  The food I eat needs to be a prepared in a certain way that I am accustomed to and complies with my religion.  The government agrees and provides us with church and makes rules that eating establishments must cater to the way we like things cooked.  All food must be fried.  Our bible tells that that anyone that doesn't not accept Jesus Christ as his savior should be put to death.  It also tell us that if someone does not submit to christianity we will be not only cheered if we bring death to them but we will be rewarded with 72 virgins if we die in the process.  
  
The local Malaysian population is getting quite sick of us disrupting their normal course of life.  Not to mention that they must now contribute more to social systems to keep our basic income going.  Along with that the government is printing more money to give us there by further devaluing the currency and making things more expensive to begin with.  Millions more people just showed up over night and infrastructure is now getting to capacity faster than anticipated.  We are telling our remain friends and family in Florida how great it is and how everyone is going out of their way to adapt to us.  Millions more show up.  
  
A native Malaysian bus driver return to the bus station at the end of the day to find that one of his co-workers who he was friends with was stabbed and throat was cut today because the us he was driving had a advertisement for stir fry shrimp on it.  We Floridians only eat fried shrimp.  It is in our bible that we can not have anything but that.  The Floridian killed the Malaysian bus driver because of an ad that he did not even chose to be on his bus, he was just driving the bus.  The Floridian who stabbed the driver is released from police custody because he did not know better and his religion told him it was ok.  So its ok.  The story won't make the news and the Malaysian's family now has no father or bread winner and now will also receive social welfare.  The other driver speaks out and says, "Hey these Floridians are not adapting to our culture like we are told they would.  Many members of our neighborhood would like them to go home and rebuild their countries."  Now who is the fascist in this situation?  The middle eastern to European migration was a joint effort by rouge elements of the US, UN, EU and other NGOs.  Its is divide and concur, Julius Caesar tactics.  "A house divided can not stand." - Abraham Lincoln.  Once enough civil unrest happens, the hammer will drop and full control of everything will be turned over to the government.  Essentially martial law.  You'll remember this post when it happens.  The true definition of fascism isn't even clear.  Wikipedia even says that, yet you throw the term around like its nothing.  Millions of people have suffered from fascism and you're calling a man who is having his banking abilities removed just for wanting the culture of his land to remain a fascist.  
  
Now true story, I have a couple clients.  Mhedi and Mohammed.  Two bothers in their 60s that came here in the 70s or 80s to escape the islamic revolution in Iran.  They came here with very little and built great businesses and are quite wealthy.  Mohammed is one of a very small hand full of people in our town with a Rolls Royce and get this he not only has one but two.  They do have accents but other than that they're just like every other American in our city.  One has a white American wife and the other has a wife from Iran.  They wanted to be Americans and they did it legally through due process, and they live better than many Americans for that matter.  No one should go to England or Germany or Sweden or Denmark or the US or Timbuktu and expect anyone to assimilate to the incoming peoples way of life, get in where you fit in.  Robinson is merely the voice of the people.  Regular everyday low rent people.  Why doesn't he have a right to be heard too?  Should he be silenced?  Should his banking methods be frozen or taken away?  Should he be thrown in a prison for that?  Boy that sure sounds fascist to me!  But no one asked me so....

Have they stopped taking money of our our checks?  No, hence government is not shut down.
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:06:20
Sorry everyone, I was wrong.  Our EMPLOYERS are taking the money out.  They can't pay their payroll taxes because the government is shut down so I guess there keeping it?!?

Honestly it’s been so long, I don’t know how many.  I’m not sure where they are either.  I need to look for them.  I bought them when bitcoin magazine got bought and they announced a last run of print mags.  I think $200 was what I paid.  Won’t sell them, hodl magazines.  Not sure what they’re worth.

Only thing that has worked for me.

The government is still taking money out of your check, hence it is not shut down.

Lol, yes.  You're in the middle of it right there.
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:22:09
Not necessarily.  We take bitcoin for our product and because only a very small portion of our sales are in bitcoin, it allows us to hold it as its such a small amount we're not really missing the money.  Been taking it since 2015 and the coins we received back then are now worth a whole more than if we had just converted to cash.  Its a lot of fun.

I think they might be confused with the guy in Texas, what was it Bitcoin Trust or something like that.  Who knows, at least they got some of it right. :/

1) Because it gives people/orgs outside of their group of friends the opportunity for prosperity.  They don't want that.  
  
2) It is unstoppable.  They did the same thing for the [internet in the late 90s]( and for the same reason.

Title is hyperbole.  The problem is economic education.  You can be smart or stupid with any type of money.  There is a factor of luck as well.  I.e. born in to a wealthy family vs poor; medical conditions that affect work or are incredibly expensive, etc.

You're right and it probably will not compete.  The US financial system works pretty well.  The real people to benefit from crypto will be outside of the US.  
  
Now thats not to say that many uses and services for it won't be in the US, it will just enable 3rd world to have some of the benefits we have had for a long time.
