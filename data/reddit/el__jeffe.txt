Checked the store. Literally nothing but price checkers

When will it be available for Windows phones?
@_date: 2014-07-10 03:52:56
Are you aware of any good apps for windows phones?

Please also forget all the people who said BTC would be worth a couple thousand by now too.

What??  I am saying all businesses follow shit laws to make money. That's why big boxes sell items produced in slave like markets. That's why fast food companies can pay their employees less than a living wage. Its why corporations pay lower tax % than me and you. Its why grocery stores sell food sprayed with poison. I guess you don't spend any money if you're not sympathetic to businesses following bad laws to make money.
what this has to do with Japanese interment camps is far beyond me.

Why the hell would he do that? He's a poster on I like bitcoin just as much as anyone else but I also live in reality.
@_date: 2015-05-22 11:18:16
What about this post meant that u/jstolfi "hates" bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:44:19
Well, start acting like a btc millionaire! 
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:40:22
it's a circlejerk of (true)love.

"generally just an asshole?" So you can't point to anything specifically he said that makes him an asshole? He just is "generally"? He raised a valid point using sarcasm. 
Honestly... it's like cartoonists being called assholes for making jokes about serious political situations or religion...
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:04:55
Was thinking more of the Simpsons or Family guy. Screw their creators! They're assholes! If only we could down-vote their shows!! Am I right?
You still can't point to anything specifically that he said that would make him an asshole.

Is it possible for previous documents to be recalled if someone hacked into my network and got into my printer somehow? How plausible is it? would they have to actually log in to my home network or just put some malware on my pc that is logged into my network? thanks :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:40:55
would you say [THIS]( is a pretty good place to start?

Is open bazar on the dark web/deep web? I don't know much about that stuff / computers in general.

Wait.... the guy is a troll because he brings up the idea that banks offer superior security against theft? If someone steals money from your credit card or checking account, you get reimbursed. If someone steals your bitcoin, someone steals your bitcoin. I am not computer savy in the least. Many people arent. Bitcoin can not only rely on the population of computer savy people. We need all people to join t he bitcoin market. Security is an issue. Banks suck, but bashing them about their security is silly, just like pretending that btc has no security issues is silly. 
How was the "troll"s comment a troll comment?
Edit: lol. downvoted.

Don't be too sarcastic now, you may be labelled a "buttcoiner". 
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:49:27
Bitcoins bad, money orders good? That makes sense...
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:37:26
think it was closer to 40k bitcoin. the usd price hit the 6k range at the bottom iirc
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:39:28

The U.S. is in charge of a lot of desert (still smaller than the Sahara) and we have plenty of sand.
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:25:43
And how is it that the US Govt got all those bitcoins they are auctioning off again?
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:56:32
Yes but this one started in 1910. wages (adjusted for inflation) are better now, despite them peaking in the 70's.
