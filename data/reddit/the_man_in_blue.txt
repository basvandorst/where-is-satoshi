No one is arguing that China has different rules. The topic of this thread, and the supporting comments indicate we are talking about the policy of the United States. 


ironic comment is ironic. Maybe drink a beer, get outside, go for a walk, or relax a bit.

so you don't actually have a source for your claims? This is just more information posted on the internet that is incorrect...
As a CBP Officer, I was hoping to be shown something new.

I work at an airport. I work with Customs. I am a U.S. Customs officer lol
Now if you're talking about foreign authorities outside the U.S. and leaving that country to come to the U.S., then that's a different issue not relevant to the OP.
Coming into the U.S. there is no limit on currency allowed, much less immigration status having any bearing on this. I still do not understand why people on and off reddit think that there is a 10k limit on bringing cash to the U.S. This will go down as one of life's greatest mysteries to me.

Here I was thinking the topic of this thread relates to U.S. Customs and their mythical $10k limit that the internet somehow believes...Silly me and others for staying on topic...

Post like this are no better than the news with their unbiased and incorrect reporting. 
There is no limit. I DO NOT understand why people think this, but hey, if it's on the internet, it must be true...
edit: way to edit your post...

I guess I can stop waiting for you to post a supporting relevant website. So here it is...
And his experience is second hand from his uncle 7 years ago, while I deal with this daily in my occupation. But you do you and your hostility too.

Poor wording on my part. 
I've been in since Oct 2017. 
It's been a few months since I've put anything more than a couple hundred into this.
