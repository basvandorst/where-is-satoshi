 Right now Bitcoin is outperforming ETH in an impressive way! 
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:28:07
Yes, you're right, many increase!! Very Doge!

Let's tame all Shitcoins! Muhaha!!

Well, BTC is performing better than all the Shitcoins ;)

To buy cheap BTC? So yes, that could be also a very nice option. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:21:53
Nice one! And yes, very true...

"...or just Bitcoin"
best part  xD

 I think we need a trap for bears, they are so annoying...

FOMO is your BRO
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:30:05
Agree, now it's too late, next time please before...
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:32:59
LOL, at which price are you going to sell them? 
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:30:43
Scammers are everywhere these days, I hope they will catch them all...
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:10:27
To weed out the FUDsters
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:18:44
Yes, maybe buy a bit today and a bit later. Could be a good deal.

I hope China will go in crypto again. China can use some opportunities if it is open to crypto!

In my opinion it's a good thing to forget Bitcoin prices sometimes. Think about 2013/14 and a few years later we had x10 BTC price. 
I'm still very positive and I'm sure lots of others, too ;)
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:31:02
Yeah, the exchanges are making money all the time, no matter if it's a bear market or a bull market...
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:35:36
LOL, nobody trust banks. Why rob a bank if you can found one...
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:38:51
I miss a "to da moon" on it ;)
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:33:10
Why not distributing free BTC at the campus? xD
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:23:24
be careful to avoid buys right before hard forks, often the coins get pumped and after the hard fork they get dumped - can end up badly for you

Personally, I thinks it's good to have different cryptos, but Bitcoin is the one of which it's good to have the biggest position. 
I don't think Bitcoin will be surpassed in the near future. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 21:16:36
People are scared by the false accusations of banksters against BTC. To scare people by bringing up false informations was everytime very successful but I hope this won't go on forever

Are you ready to order a LAMBO?!
