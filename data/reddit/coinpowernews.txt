If you think logically about the situation that you are describing here, no one will worry about bitcoin only the basic needs are important in such a moment. the price of drinking water will rise enormously and will be the new gold.

You are only a part of the bitcoin community when you see bitcoin fall and you choose not to sell because you believe in bitcoin. And everyone has had this test, but only the true believers remain.

I am done with the nonsens cycle, we need to go to a new era, where we can forgot the fiat currency and start selling and buying with btc, this Exchange nonsens brings us nowhere!

So if your bitcoin is worth 1 million, you believe in the dollar again .. strange reasoning here lol
@_date: 2019-11-14 03:44:40
We have already had an extreme increase from $ 3100 to $ 14000 on which do you base a further rise? On the halving? This halving does not have to mean that we are going to rise again. If this is your strategy, I would advise you not to buy bitcoin. Get into bitcoin because you want to protect yourself against the uncertain future that awaits us. It is these nonsensical messages that ensure that bitcoin continues to be seen as a "quick money-making system" bitcoin is much more than this. Learn yourself in it once. The motivation to earn big money with it is based on tin air as this motivation leads to the loss of your money, because it is this motivation that makes the bankers and everything else rich. You will never sell at highs and always sell at lows. If your motivation is not based on money but rather on protecting yourself and your family then there is no better option than bitcoin and physical gold. If money is your motivation, Prepare to face the people who control the dollar and let me give you a hint. you will lose!

you can't talk to Peter. this is also something that people need to realize. peter is super smart. do you really think he doesn't understand what bitcoin is? But how does he earn his money? suppose he would say "okay you're right bitcoin succeeded" and then what? We would all be happy for a week and then we will soon forget Peter because there are more interesting bitcoin bulls like Peter, but he is the best known bitcoin bear! this is how he earns his money. "Admitting" that bitcoin is a superior system would mean that he would no longer be invited to talk shows! He is the one who laughs the loudest. everyone invites him to "convince" him Peter has long been convinced! he will never call it in public!

you probably did not know it yourself yet but you believed in the dollar but not in bitcoin. There is nothing wrong with bitcoin and still 100% up since day 1.

Let's hope they do not adopt it. Then bitcoin will remain of the common people like you and me for which it is meant. Hope that bitcoins are adopted by multi milion companies equals a total ignorance of bitcoin.
I understand that a lot of people are in it to make money. This goal is of course necessary for adoption, but I'd rather be in this phase for another 5 years than multi milion companies take our market.
It seems like we want to give it to them like that, for the first time in the history of mankind we have a tool that makes us free of the elite.
Let's continue for our offspring and let's not give away this rough diamond called the blockchain to a bunch of manipulators like BAKKT or an ETF or which nonsense they will come along in the future.
They have told us a lot of nonsense the last year. And let everyone think that we would need the big companies to raise the price.
Do you know who started this? PALM BEACH (Teeka Tiwari) he started with this nonsense. He is a failed hedge funds manager. He then focuses on the crypto community and asks thousands of dollars for his subscriptions. Suddenly he started with a comparison from 2000 with the [dot.com]( bubble. And that we would need the big companies to raise the price. This liar has been able to convince all of the community And almost the entire crypto community has taken over this.
Did you hear about this in 2017 or 2016 or 2015? I did not hear anything about it at the time. People need hope and these companies abuse that hope to keep you on the line.
Name 1 company that has really helped the bitcoin community today? The only thing I've seen is that they are bothering the entire market with empty promises that are always withdrawn over time. Lamborgini's own company has put the crypto community in the back by saying that they do not want crypto milionaires. As if we are criminals!
And starbucks that supposedly would adopt bitcoin and needed 3 days to suddenly deny this. Or an ETF that is withdrawn by the requesting party. They all lie together and they want to take over the market. JPmorgan says we have to separate the blockchain from bitcoin?
Stop calling for multinationals that are supposed to save the market. Because they will never do that! The next real crisis in 2020, we will see what bitcoin really is worth without any contribution from multi-million companies!
Bitcoin was built in a crisis, for a next crisis. 
Keep that in your mind.

You clearly do not understand anything about bitcoin.

I hope we will stop the HODL nonsense soon! This brings us nowhere. We need transactions between you and me. Instead of buying something with dollars, we should all buy something with bitcoin. Let's start with that. Do you think that banks and governments are afraid of bitcoin in this form for which almost everyone uses bitcoin today - HODL? No of course not! What they fear is that we will pay each other with bitcoin and use bitcoin for what it was really made for, they fear because this would put their fiat system out of play! This HODL nonsense only provides an extra asset on this planet for which they are not afraid at all! in fact, they are laughing at themselves because the biggest manipulators of this form of "bitcoin assets" are the gouverments and banks! We will have to repack ourselves if we want to turn the tide. Try to pay something with bitcoin now and then, this would really help bitcoin, let's introduce a bitcoin payday with the community, this is what we need! Waiting until all millionaires have bought a bitcoin is really ridiculous! Bitcoin is made for the common people and let's certainly not hand bitcoin over to the dollar-millionaires.

This Exchange bull shit is bring us nowhere. We filling the pockets of the Guys that are rape the community everyday.

bitcoin means freedom you are now trying to do the same as what banks and governments want to impose on you by means of extortion, if binance chooses not to implement segwit then we must respect that .. they do a lot for the community of course they also try to push their own coin and they have the right to do so. if i need an exchange i just stay on binance!

bitcoin will be worth millions in a fiat currency that is not worth anything at that moment.
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:34:33
No its not !
   
These contracts are for controlling bitcoin. And it has nothing to do with the real adoption these contracts are the axis of evil in the crypto world we should boycott everything from the financial world. The real adoption is with us the people. No control freaks like banks and hedge funds

the bitcoins have already been found ��

Many people do not realize it, but bitcoin is already a global currency. Name 1 country in this world where you can not trade bitcoins against the local currency?
The dollar is also a world currency, but I have to go to the exchange office in the Netherlands to use the dollar, because I have to exchange dollars against euros.
BUT, I can use it everywhere and this is also possible with bitcoin.
To say that it becomes a world currency is to deny that it already is one. That is my opinion

This means that he sold his bitcoins around December 19, 2017. As long as he does not show a trade history or a blockchain transaction, I do not believe this story at all.

So they want to torture the entire population for the few people they actually possess? Gold is tangible and hard to hide in large quantities, unlike bitcoin, I can carry a billion worth with a code in my head. This is the power of bitcoin. Once again gold is the value of storage for governments and bitcoin is the value of storage for the people.
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:03:52
I agree with you.
But what does this have to do with this topic ..
And I use the word "stupid" to make it clear that they are not stupid.  If you have misunderstood, then I must say sorry. But this topic is about this bank telling us that the price will go down to $ 1200 per bitcoin and I just try to make it clear that JP Morgan never says anything for no reason. 
Do not know what your reaction has to do with it ..

Well I have an insurance on my house on my car on my camper, I even have an insurance on my wife. If there is even one moment in your life that you believe that the fiat system will fail then $ 25 in bitcoin is a good way to insure your own against it. After all, you have a reserve in a totally different payment system when the rest falls. I think that should be worth something..
@_date: 2019-01-21 06:00:28
Okay, and what are the Chinese waiting for ..? This is just nonsense news and based on empty air.
I'm a bitcoin bull but this title really does not make sense. Just as the Russians are buying 10 billion in bitcoins, even that nonsense.
just patience bitcoin is coming. After all, there is still no better answer to the financial world than bitcoin.

We absolutely do not need an ETF. They create inflation through these ETfs. There will be countless paper bitcoins. It is bad news. And anyone who calls for a bitcoin ETF has not understood the real purpose of bitcoin. Yes, we will see a  increase in the bitcoin price if they are ever approved. 
But it will work more like a pump and everyone knows what happens to pumps, DUMPS. We only need adoption among the people this care also for more decentralization. Calling for ETFs makes no sense and is based on ignorance and laziness to find out for yourself what an ETF really is. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 06:44:36
If hyperinflation will really hit the dollar euro pound then there is probably no one left to exchange its bitcoin to fiat currency. Take an example: in venezuela 1 bitcoin costs more than 826 billion bolivar. 
But do you think someone will exchange their bitcoins against bolivar? I think satoshis will get a value on their own without a link to the fiat system. 
And let's be honest if bitcoin wants to succeed as a currency it has to be completely disconnected from the comparison with the dollar. A satoshi should be exactly that a satoshi. Mankind has to move away from the value with fiat currency.
And now let's not think hyper-inflation can not hit the dollar because that's big delusion. The Roman empire also went under to hyper inflation .. Today we see no one compares his money in the Spanish dollar or ..
What I mean by that is that every era comes with its own payment method. The inability to view this is, in my opinion, a lack of imagination of innovation. The dollar will fall, bitcoin will become millions in a fiat-currency that is worth nothing at that moment. 
History shows that this always goes hand in hand with war and misery and I do not know whether we should be happy with it either. But I am convinced that bitcoin becomes money for a new era. Today we are on the eve of this event. 
Summary: I think the bitcoin will be worth millions in fiat-currency that are worth nothing at that moment and I think this will happen within 10 to 15 years

safe for whom? for the elite .. yes that's right but gold is absolutely not safe for private individuals. why? when it comes down to it, the governments will take all the gold out of the population but look back in history they do this time after time. But gold remains gold. Bitcoin is the winner of value for the people and gold is a valuable value for governments.

I hate that bank. But to be honest you have to listen to it what they say and when they say it. I am pro-bitcoin for life but these are companies that control the world. Often it is true what they say. You must understand that they are not just calling something. They also have a credibility in the world that they do not want to destroy. Getting unrivaled about a statement they make breaks their reputation. Calling that bankers are stupid and calling this because they are against bitcoin makes you blind. They are against bitcoin but everything they call comes out, you can not deny this. In the short term, I certainly believe that it is possible. But make sure you see this as an opportunity. Just like they do this. $ 1200 bitcoin price must be a blessing. Why? Because we are already so low, we can just as well go lower. Then the bankers have got their right they can sleep peacefully again and we can add even cheaper to our wallets. Win win situation. At least if you really believe in the market just like me.

Here is the complete denial of Russia. I always do my research before I say something : 
“Russia is not planning to buy $10 billion in bitcoin this quarter, according to an official with the Russian State Duma. Elina Sidorenko, chair of the Duma’s cryptocurrency group, says the rumors are nonsense.
“This statement has no common sense,” Sidorenko told ForkLog. “The Russian Federation — like any other country in the world — is simply not ready to combine its traditional financial system with cryptocurrencies.”
And to say that this idea can be implemented in Russia for at least the next 30 years is unlikely.
Sidorenko was reacting to reports claiming Russia was planning to invest $10 billion in bitcoin to mitigate the economic impact of US sanctions.”

Good point I am an absolute bitcoin bull.
We always seek confirmation in history but I think you are right here. 
But also due to the fact that bitcoin is unique, the comparison with e-mail comes closest. But I agree with you on this point.
