Depending on what state you are in you might be able to USE Kraken which would be the cheapest option.

Why are the Mastercoins being valued so much higher than the market rate.  Is someone on the team a large holder of mastercoins or something?  Seems like a pump for MSC to me I don't like the feel of this.
Edit MSC instead of MST

Can we get the penny stock garbage off this subreddit please.
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:03:33
Although I agree with you on the direction, your friend got a better trade.  You're risking 1K to win 2k when if you had bought 1K USD worth of BTC today and the price goes to 2k you would make more money.  Your friend can hedge this bet right now and guarantee profit.

Honestly you should probably save some of that as regular cash considering you're young, I'm assuming, and may want to buy a car or something in the near future.  I guess you might be able to just buy the car in BTC though!

25K XBT a month is ~830 XBT a day and lately BFX has been doing ~5K xbt a day that means you need to be posting liquidity for almost a 1/6 of all trading activity to get the 0 in fees. With current volumes BFX can only support a max of 6 of these traders in an extreme condition.
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:25:58
You're talking about one of the most heavily regulated aspects of the modern financial world.  This is exactly why bitfunder and btct crashed and burned this is not just something you do and code up the regs

In a financial crisis people have to deleverage that means selling all assets, gold and btc aren't immune to this.

According to that doc you only get access to the student checking account or 5 years then it rolls over into a regular account.  I think this is completely reasonable idk why you think otherwise.  And if you don't like it just take your money out and go elsewhere.  
This post has absolutely nothing to do with XBT.

This right here is the right answer

I really like the sudden now the masternodes get 2X what they were before when the hard fork blew up.
@_date: 2014-10-06 21:52:38
No way in hell does the SEC allow this. And even if they did it's going to take years to get approval.  OSTK probably won't even be around by then given their MoM performance.

Not weird, nothing to see here.

The same move happened on stamp I don't think this was a flash crash also the exchange didn't halt
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:06:21
This article doesn't take into account the fact that the currently block reward size is subsidizing current Bitcoin transactions.  That means EVERYONE that holds BTC is currently paying to keep these cheap transaction fees afloat.
@_date: 2014-04-21 19:21:40
"During the initial sale, safecoins will be made available via purchase of a ‘proxy token’ called MaidSafeCoin. These are recorded on the bitcoin block chain and available from buysafecoins.com at a price of 17,000 for 1 BTC, or 3,400 for 1 MSC (Mastercoin)."
Interesting that the Mastercoin value is .2 BTC according to their ipo, as of right now you can buy Mastercoin and get about a 10% extra amount of Safecoins as opposed to buying directly with BTC.  Not sure why they went with this rate though.
@_date: 2014-08-13 11:38:34
Bitstamp looks like they have a new bank not sure yet if thats good or bad, probably bad though if unicredit told them to take a hike new bank is  Raiffeisen 
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:44:22
The remittance model for Bitcoin only works in the event you have organic demand in the country you're remitting too.  Someone needs to be buying the bitcoin on the other end of the trade and that implied FX rate needs to be lower than what you'd pay otherwise.  This also all begs the question if end to end XBT is just the vehicle for value then in theory the whole trade could be done without XBT in between someone just needs to be able to do the FX rate for less than the status quo
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:31:46
Ostk is down 42% YTD while the SPX is up 5.5% that company is a dog with fleas no amount of bitcoin is going to save it.

There's a lot of confusion among the comments in this thread so I'd like to clear some things up.  Chipotle derived over 85% of their 2013 Revenue from selling Guac.  Guac is that delicious green addition that you see many people partaking in during their delicious meal.  Guac is the killer app of chipotle, Bitcoin needs a Guac.

"The only correlation you're seeing is that litecoin tends to move with bitcoin" 
That would only be true if I was looking at the LTC/USD cross but I'm looking at LTC/BTC.  If your statement was true we wouldn't see any change in the LTC/BTC rate.
