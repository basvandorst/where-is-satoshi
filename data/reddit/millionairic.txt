Why did you buy bitcoin in the first place. Try to remember. Then I’d recommend doing your own research because it appears you’re asking strangers on the internet for financial advice.  Then consider if it’s a good idea to chase the “hot coin” that’s just went up in value a lot. I’d say look into ripple extensively before you invest in it. Same advice goes for any crypto.

I have a question please. If you’re day trading , wouldn’t his cause taxation events. Short term taxes at that. Wouldn’t the trades you make have to greatly outweigh the tax for you to be successful at this? Are there day traders out there who are unaware that they have to pay taxes under these circumstances ?

@_date: 2017-12-30 00:42:07
Help with clarification please. 
Coinbase tax FAQ says transactions in and out of the btc wallet are not treated as sales of digital currency.
With that being said when calculating my gains/losses that makes me technically at a loss in the negative because ive bought more than ive cashed out. Is my understanding correct and does this mean i do not have to report anything? 
I understand this isnt a tax forum or all the other snarky responses some of you angry people may respond with. Please just help as the information will help others and I will also use what I learn to personally help others as I am the first in my network of crypto buddies who are actively seeking tax information. Thank you.

Last year jack from jack in the box went on live television and told everyone that bitcoin was about to crash when it was at 19k. So I hope “binance ceo” has the same foresight as jack .
(I thought it was eerily creepy how jack confidently and blatantly announced that in his commercial and was so accurate )

 I Have a question as I have started reading the book recently . I totally agree with the sentiment that bitcoin is obviously the soundest money. However do you feel as if the author comes across as biased instead of objective ? As if he’s trying to persuade you towards bitcoin which if so kind of takes away from the overall idea . Opinions ?
@_date: 2018-11-07 01:45:12
True . I just feel as if I have confirmation bias while reading the book because I’m also bullish on bitcoin.

I paid for something with cash today. I received back change in the form of very disgusting and old grimey looking cash and some inconvenient silver coins to carry . I hardly wanted to touch the money. I suppose I coulda just used a debit card but still.... ever since I’ve gotten into crypto every time I pay with cash I just think how terrible it is.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:46:42
Guys i have to share this info, its driving me crazy. 
First of all in the USA the stock market fell 666(mark of the beast). points on Friday which was the6th worse point drop in history and on the 33rd(freemasonry) day of the year.
Coupled with that info, has anyone seen that Jack in the box commercial that began airing in January of this year, maybe even in December not sure. But I have for sure saw this commercial on mainstream media multiple times before this crash happened. How in the world would Jack know precisely when bitcoin is about to "crash". This is blatant programming and an orchestrated agenda being played out to all of us as sheep and it feels like we are hopeless.
Additional sidenotes. I dont watch the news ever due to obvious reasons probably from my texts above. But theres a general sentiment in the society where everyone is so againts bitcoin and crypto. They are brainwashing everyone to believe its bad. 
Personal story: I went to a tax company to do my taxes. I brought my laptop so I could sign into bitcoin.tax and prepare to do my taxes with my info. The accountant did not know anything about how to connect to the internet through wifi so she directed me to get assistance fro someone else. Then when she realized I was asking about crypto taxes she says " Oh i heard bitcoin is bad you shouldnt do that" Yes i got advised not to participate in cryptocurrency from a lady who doesnt know how to connect to wifi because crypto "is bad".
Secondly I tried talking to personal acquaintances about these same sentiments and sharings and they do not see any coincidence or anything wierd occuring. I feel like im living straight out of 1984 or brave new world. Someone please come together and conversate with me about this stuff!
