I sold all my bcash for ripple never looking back 
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:42:55
You out that sign there didn't you

Not enough to retire.. My goal is to buy a Tesla with bitcoin eventually 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:39:49
Good call thanks! 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:00:42
Either way you'll be making money so just be happy about the involuntary income! Also check out alt coins I got my eye on Z cash and ripple diversify for safety.. Or not :) 
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:31:38
This is freaking amazing! 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:50:07
Yeah I just listened to this and it's got me thinking... So why should I believe in bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:54:10
Currently at 3.2 so it will be a while.. I had no idea at the time that it would get where it was... I actually totally forgot I bought them but when news came it hit 1500 I was happily surprised then I started researching more about it and been strapped in to the moon ever since 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:47:35
You won't lose money if you don't sell! 
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:56:28
I just listened to it and I don't know what to think anymore, and any info on this sub supporting Peter is just being down voted to hell... Seems pretty if your not with us you're against us when if just be happy to read a discussion between both ideas and arguments 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:35:13
That's what I did :(
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:38:23
Thanks for the link 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:25:55
Another reason not to sell then.. I mean it's currency so just pay with stuff with that! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:25:14
Same I wouldn't be into bitcoin without my desire to find mdma and acid I laugh at in now that I bought 10 btc at 1 time and spent it all at a time where that only cost me 1000$
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:39:17
So should I keep my coins in the legacy wallet or the 2x wallet for the split 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:39:43
Thank you so much for clearing my confusion
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:35:25
So it doesn't matter they are in segwit right now? I can choose to get the split coins after the fork or not? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:06:55
Bitcoin is dead 
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:40:28
Aliens 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:07:45
Taxes? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:53:52
I put mine into the 2x cause it was reccomended.. I'm guessing I should move them?
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:08:05
Why are you not worried the people at r/btc say you should be worried 
@_date: 2017-05-04 06:35:29
You mean the past 72 hours basically 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:19:50
So what's the game plan, I have all my coins in electrum. Will I be getting those forked coins with them? Is the plan to sell off the bitcoin cash and hodl onto the bitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:12:47
Still trying to figure it out.....maybe if I had a better understanding of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:07:20
Haha! I bought 1500 worth at 2500 if your livid then I'm going on a murder spree
