The idea is extra security. With a two day withdrawal period, you should have time to solve a hack before your Bitcoin is stolen. 
I also recommend better solutions to hold your Bitcoin. I like coinbase as a safe place to buy and sell,  but I don't hold there.

If it increases Bitcoin's utility, I agree completely.  
To me,  that is the key: Create more utility; drive higher BTC price.

First question is easy - I went to Trezor on my cold storage and Mycelium (Android-based) on my hot wallet, which also helps for the Trezor. 
You will hear mixed to negatively slanted views on Coinbase. The main gripe is that by using Coinbase you don't technically "own" your Bitcoins. Coinbase stores the keys. This makes it easier because you don't have to worry about it, but you also lose ownership and flexibility (core tenants of bitcoin).
Where I disagree with Reddit is in regard to the second gripe. Coinbase has been requiring people to leave the service when they are found to be doing illegal(ish) stuff. For example, if you were to fund a gambling website with your Coinbase hot wallet, you may get asked to leave. They won't steal your bitcoin. They just ask you to move it to another wallet provider. 
Coinbase is trying to stay legitimate (in my opinion). I don't partake in any gray or sketchy things with Bitcoin, so this is non-issue for me. I have no fear of Coinbase. I did move my Bitcoin because I like the idea of controlling it. It's a good feeling once you do it -- very empowering. 
I still use Coinbase to buy bitcoin. I would also use them to sell. I have complete confidence/trust in the service from that perspective. Honestly, I doubt Coinbase even cares if i move my bitcoin. They get paid on the buy/sell transactions. Holding Bitcoin is just a freebie service to help out their customers. 
Coinbase is backed by high quality venture capitalists, which is a good thing for Bitcoin in general. It also gives me confidence in the service at a high level.

If something rises from 1k to 20k in one year, why can't it fall 20k to 3k?
Bitcoin has nothing to lean back on like other assets. This is a blessing and a curse. Social truth is the name of that game and it can rise and fall quickly.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:24:23
That makes no sense. You may want to reconsider why you are investing.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:28:19
He is right. Avoid every comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:07:25
We are in the wild west. What can rise to 20k could fall to 5k. It could even go to a 100k.

The biggest driver of price increase will be increased utility of Bitcoin, whether as a true currency or even ledger for other assets. The more use equals more value. In particular, I like the fact more assets will be logged via the Bitcoin Blockchain because it reduces the risk of regulation ever destroying it.

I appreciate your thoughts as well, right or wrong. I don't know why people cant accept hearing opinions from both sides...

It's interesting because at the end of the day the Bitcoin price will represent it's utility in society: more nodes equals more utility (not perfect but it is reasonable over the long term). Supply and demand helps keep this stuff in balance.

Ehh free? The model changed. It's all about that festival cheddar. The more people listen; the more they make at live events.

I should add that this is available on his website, Axios. I got it from the daily email blast (which is why everyone will see it).

Guys - This is the Internet of Things. It needed a payment infrastructure to work and that is what 21 set out to build. 
Just ponder on it for a minute.

"a rise is expected" is not the right way to think about it. Just want to make that clear. Could it happen? Sure.

Capital controls are a real concern, no question. That said, the Chinese government is practical, and I find it hard to believe they will shutdown a technology that they are arguably leading in. Pure opinion of course...

Keep working with Coinbase. It's a reputable company. They aren't looking to steal people's cash. It's probably a rogue employee or the like. Best of luck.

What financial reporting? They sensationalize everything.

Russia is probably perfectly capable tracking Bitcoin. Why would they care? There's more risk around physical cash moving. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:43:22
Seriously bad idea. Bitcoin has incredible volatility, which is equally good and bad. 
@_date: 2019-06-15 13:22:04
Social truth is all that matters. As people believe it's real, it will become real. Articles like this point to a positive trend in that happening.
@_date: 2019-02-12 00:11:29
Bitcoin will rise if crypto rises. No alt has that certainty. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:23:45
Sadly, this is one of the issues with crypto.

All of you Coinbase conspiracy theorist.... They are a start-up trying to legitimize a product through proper means. Get over it.

Nobody should ever use Zero Hedge for investment advice; it's truly awful and should be viewed like the tabloids. That said, the concept of bitcoin as a hedge to China is intriguing. To be clear, I am completely against the China bear case. I'm actually a buyer of Chinese stocks right now as they liberalize the market. It will be bumpy, but I expect it to have worked three years from now. 
Even though I'm bullish on China, I'm a huge fan of cheap protection. I would own the exact same amount of Bitcoin either way, but I do find it intellectually stimulating that they may provide an odd hedge to my China bet. Much better than the currency or soon bonds....

WhatsApp or Paytm will win India. If one of those two adopts a crypto currency it could happen,  otherwise it's a lost cause.

Why exactly are we worried that a well-funded company like Coinbase won't solve for this issue? It's like 1999 all over again.
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:47:42
The passport part makes no sense. It should be the ultimate form or ID. No argument there. 
I just get annoyed with all of the Bitcoin is the future comments coupled with complaints when someone actually tries to legitimize it. The founder left a crazy good gig before starting this company. He's not some government mole.
@_date: 2016-02-27 16:26:59
This comment has literally no idea what it is talking about. The settlement process can absolutely be improved, dramatically. The fact it takes two to three days to settle is crazy. It has not improved in over twenty years. 
I will not claim that the Blockchain is the answer to faster settlements, but I can say definitively that technology will improve the process in the near future. Most friction we face in the financial markets is literally a toll along the way where someone is getting paid. The fact the financial world has more or less avoided all technological innovation is astonishing and exactly why it's the next massive area for disruption. Again, I'm not saying that bitcoin or the Blockchain is even a part of that disruption, but the financial industry will change. The amount of money that will change hands from this disruption will be astonishing.

Silver's intrinsic price is around 14 dollars (industrial use case). Gold has intrinsic value but it's well below current levels. Not sure on exact level but think 70% below the spot.

Most of the doom and gloom crowd generate terrible long term investment results. You get a few examples of amazing results,  such as Paulson, which keeps the concept sexy. In reality,  the best investors are net long the vast majority of time and good at picking bad companies to hedge risk.

This likely stemmed from Fred Wilson, early Coinbase investor. Check out his blog.
