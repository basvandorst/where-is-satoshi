Sorry bro. Just realized the tone of that... Thought I was replying to the other guy for a second. Lol

You keep stating his convictions as if that means just because he wasn't convicted of it doesn't mean he didn't do it. It doesn't. Getting that conviction doesn't just come down to "Look what he did", that's why lawyers are a thing.

Where did you show me it was completely false? You give me a big ole "could be" statement.

He was never proven innocent or guilty because the charges were dropped for something a little easier to chase. Common law practice.

Wow man. I can't even. Great discussion tho.

Didn't he pay, or at least try to pay, for someone to be killed? Then as tricked into thinking it had been done?

Why is everyone getting so butt hurt? I was just stating something and you guys are acting like he's a god. I really enjoyed some of his ideas but I was just disturbed how he was being portrayed in the post when it just isn't so.

I understand what he was convicted for, but the text on the image is kinda misleading. ����‍♂️

You do remember where we were discussing how he was hiring guys to off someone? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:42:23
Because the image is trying to portray him as some amazing guy when that just wasn't the case. Not that I don't believe in what he was trying to achieve, but he did some fucked shit to a lot of people.
