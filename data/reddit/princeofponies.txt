And as for the rest of your comment - that just shows you have no respect. You couldn't give a fuck. There's really no point in discussing the issue, since greed and getting something for free trumps all else in your mind. Enjoy your morally bankrupt life.

As someone old enough to have worked in the music industry prior to the internet - your attitude is both entirely to be expected and entirely responsible for the decimation of that industry and the end of the idea that a musician can be paid fairly for the work they do.  As someone with no respect for the content producers rights you're nothing better than a looter who seeing other people smashing shop windows and stealing TVs decides that "if they're doing it, I can do it."  Your thinking is sheep like and respects no one but yourself and your own benefit. Where do you think music, films and books come from? The thousands and thousands of hours a single individual puts into honing their craft? But that's worthless to you? It's just something you can grab from the shelf and not feel any guilt about because "the artist never gets any money anyway?"

Musicians/songwriters used to make a great deal of money from publishing. More particularly in the old system where people paid for music, record labels would advance large sums of money to bands to record albums and tour. It was generally understood that for the majority of acts this would never be recouped by sales. Most albums lost money. The funds the industry invested in these advances supported a huge network of recording studios, studio engineers and all of the publicity and management that went along with trying to make a new act work.  All of that is gone.
