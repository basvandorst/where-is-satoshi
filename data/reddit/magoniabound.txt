There's a lot to dislike about Trump, but also things to admire. One thing that I like is that he doesn't kowtow to the prevailing PC and leftist tendencies that are plaguing the western world. Leftist ideologies have infected the media to such an extent that it's become a pseudo-religious dogma that cannot be challenged, blocking any attempt to voice alternative views.

Actually the expression is "I could**n't** give a rats ass", not "could give a rats ass". And similarly "could**n't** care less", not "could care less". FFS why do people keep getting this wrong?

And for more proof there's: PutinCoin (PUT), TrumpCoin (TRUMP), President Trump (PRES) and Useless Ethereum Token (UET). UET is arguably the most honest altcoin available and justifiably uses a "flipping the bird" icon.

Thanks for sharing your knowledge. I'm just starting out in the auto trading area. Professionally I'm a C# programmer but I also use F For this project I've decided to use F# because a functional programming language seems to fit the domain extremely well, largely due to the mathematical nature of the domain. One thing that I've found really nice about F# is that it has Algebraic Data Types, which makes the decision logic extremely clean and unambiguous.

Could you give some examples of when Microsoft  seized lead dev accounts and handed them over to the NSA or CIA? All I can say is that it's much better for the crypto community that Microsoft  bought GitHub rather than Google or especially Oracle.

That is from an old Chinese proverb: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”

No problem dude, the CIA has a [Secret Time Travel Program]( So simply join the CIA, go back in time and buy $1000 dollars worth of Bitcoins when they were just 1 cent each.

You're being willfully ignorant. A group of miners and some very wealthy individuals are manipulating the system, trying to artificially inflate BCH prices and push down BTC. They don't care about the future of crypto, just short term gains and the hope of controlling the bulk of the market going forward.

That is truly scary. As this can't obviously happen in reality, lets hope companies like Intel, AMD or NVIDIA with their vast technical resources, can come up with much more efficient mining hardware.

Rust has similar speeds to C++ but much safer and far more reliable. Haskell would be ideal for smart contract software. C++ is simply not a good programming language by modern standards.

Keep this in mind. The Chinese government still venerate Mao, who killed between 30 and 40 million people. That's more than Hitler or Stalin! That's the kind of mentality we're dealing with when it comes to the Chinese government.

The Chinese government still venerates Mao, a man who killed anywhere between 30 and 40 million people! That's more then Hitler or Stalin. It means they will do whatever the fuck they want to do.

It's a huge undertaking that requires a whole team of people. Simply forking and hacking away by an individual is rather pointless. The suggestion is that the Bitcoin development team need to take a deep look at the tools they're using. C or C++ are truly terrible languages for building reliable systems in a timely manner. Rust and Haskell take advantage of more than 50 years of computer science research and practice, while C++ has grown organically into a very complicated programming language, largely ignoring CS advancements.
Quoting Tony Hoare: *"Programmers are always surrounded by complexity; we cannot avoid it.... If our basic tool, the language in which we design and code our programs, is also complicated, the language itself becomes part of the problem rather than part of its solution."*

While it would involve a lot of work, the Bitcoin development team should at least consider re-writing the software using the Rust programming language sometime in the future.  C and C++ have their roots in the 1970s and while fast, are terrible languages for writing robust and trustworthy systems. C/C++ were probably a reasonable choice in 2009, considering what was available back then, but we now have a viable alternative in Rust, when it comes to a fast non-garbage collected language that is also inherently safer. 
And for any smart contract development in the Bitcoin space, Haskell would be ideal. In the smart contract area absolute speed is less important than correctness, so Haskell would make a good choice, due to it's very powerful type system.

Don't know what you're talking about. I've been using Visual Studio for 20 years and have used it for C, C++, VB, C# and F# with no problems at all.

So Scott Adams is a criminal on the same level as Hitler because you don't agree with some of his opinions? Apart from Nazis, who on Earth would consider Mein Kamph to be well written and logical?
