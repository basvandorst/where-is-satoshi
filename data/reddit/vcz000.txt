Lol wtf is this non sense

1 btc is enough to make a move imo. It will force you to read a bit more about the fork :) 
Moving it from coinbase to your own wallet is fairly simple to do. Also the whole point is to control your key so you own your btcs
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:38:16
Yeah can some1 confirm that coinbase crashed ?
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:58:22
Allright Just when I come looking for a post like this. 
Can someone credible confirm ?:)

Duly noted thanks guys

Isnt it where you spend bad money(usd) when you can and keep the good money?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:00:02
The old school strategy to buy and hold is also about your beliefs in the company/technology that will make it in the long term. I would compare AOL to coinbase more than bitcoin !
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:18:33
Yup you will have to do it yourself tho
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:10:00
Thank you sir !
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:06:23
Well putted . So many opinions for so many possibilities but at least we know the reason why it keeps growing
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:21:20
Still just look at transferring it on a real wallet so you keep it safe and sell your x2 at the best price !
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:25:22
How can you have doubt about scaling potential ? Do you have something concrete ? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:15:27
You save a lot fees I guess
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:43:01
Feel the pain yo
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:31:02
Rip lambo
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:26:05
Ah ok nvm .. You have no clue
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:42:55
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:59:51
Opinion rejected - you say almost every area just to give you some backup ? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:18:21
This summarize  what Ive read  and understood in the past month or so . Is this any good ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:05:53
Ive been into crypto for the last few months. It took me a while to figured ou what was going on. 
First time I hear this ver guy speaks and I can now understand how frustrating this is. Can’t imagine how furious people who have been here for years.
Can you be more full of shit ? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:20:02
Sticky post ? Great stuff
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:56:14
Same here hahah 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:00:13
as I understand this, coinbase said they would give BCC and they didn't . So I wouldn't trust them with this fork.
