Microwave is a perfect example of my point: something which took 30 minutes on the stove takes 2 in the microwave. That's a serious improvement that the lay-person can appreciate!
Here are my counter-arguments, from the user's perspective. A lot of your points are really more applicable to merchants:
- Cannot be counterfeited - Dollars in my bank account could only be counterfeited by a bank which is unlikely to happen
- Fast, inexpensive transactions - Credit cards are faster. They don't take 10 minutes to confirm.
- Secure transactions (engaging in a transaction doesn't expose your account to risk) - Credit card companies will reimburse you for fraudulant transactions
- Allows for real time auditing where useful - Not sure how this is useful to consumers
- Privacy through obscurity where useful - Cash does this too
- Is not subject to massive inflation - Average person doesn't care about inflation
- Is not subject to transaction restrictions, capital controls - Average person probably doesn't care about this either
- Is not subject to charge backs (both an advantage and disadvantage, admittedly) - As a consumer, an irreversible transaction is a huge disadvantage as unscrupulous companies can keep my money and refuse to issue a refund
Just so you know, i'm on board with the bitcoin revolution but I think the tendency is to over-estimate adoption rates because that's what we all want around here.
Ever heard that saying, "What gets in the way of a *great* life? A *good* one." Bitcoin is *great* money. The current system is *good* compared to previous barter-based systems and it's so gosh darn convenient.

I'm not a Tor expert but you might log into your router's console and be able to see the outgoing connections in the logs?
That's about the only thing I can think of. I hope you get your coins back!

I don't think envy has any political leanings

I agree. I don't think bitcoin will have any substantial impact on real-life gambling. Except perhaps, being able to buy chips with bitcoin someday (and turning them back in for bitcoin if you don't lose them all)
@_date: 2013-02-01 20:07:30
That's kind of what I thought. I'm pretty sure these coins are unrecoverable
@_date: 2013-02-05 16:26:21
It's exactly the same as microsoft points, in that it's a non-transferable voucher system. 
One key difference is that Amazon Coins are pegged at $0.01 each.

How do I get ripples points?
No one has any to send to anyone..

Until we get our paychecks in btc, pricing everything in usd and converting makes the most sense.
If you got your paycheck in btc, bought your food and paid your rent in btc, then a pure btc price makes sense.

Most 0% cards are not 0% on cash advances. So you'd have to buy coins with a credit card and then transfer them to the exchange. As far as I know, the only play to buy BTC with a credit card is btcquick.com and they charge 7% fee.
Some cards will have "super checks" which you can deposit directly into your account. They are sometimes 0% but often times not.
You might be able to do a cash advance, and then find another card with a 0% on balance transfers. I think now-a-days they always charge a 3% fee though.
Or, if you had a bank line of credit or a HELOC, you could just tap it.
If I were you, I would just gamble with money I already had (and could afford to lose).

All of the currency on ripple (besides XRP) is actually debt. 
Technically, you can extend me a line of credit which I can tap. You would get IOUs from me, but if you ever want to convert them to actual cash, you'd need to go through a gateway

Actually, 2 is 2x more than 1.

"Dateline Special Report: Terrorists use online currency 'bitcoin' to buy weapons"
"Breaking News: US Raids operators of online terrorist currency 'bitcoin'"
"Congress passes law to make online terrorist currency illegal"
I don't think it would take long, really. Like I said, it wouldn't kill it. Nothing could really kill it. But it would make it's adoption impossible by law abiding citizens, which would have the same effect.

Has the average person ever had an issue with using counterfeit dollars?? I don't know what kind of people you associate with but it's never been a problem for me.
Again, all of my answers were from the consumer perspective. Credit cards are instant: swipe card -&gt; walk out of store with goods
In my day to day transactions, I don't really care about trace-ability. If i give money to the local food bank via bitcoin, am I really going to watch that address and see where that $50 goes?
Your point about privacy on the internet is a valid one, but probably not enough for the average person to switch unless they are involved in illicit activities.
Regarding inflation: I think more people are concerned about jobs and bills then they are about inflation. Look at media, look at the culture. The average person probably spends close to 100% of their money, which to me means they aren't all that concerned with their future purchasing power...
Ask your grandma about "Capital controls" and see if she cares...
Disputes are one thing and fraud is another. 
Anyway, my point is that the current system has significant inertia behind it which we can't discount. Especially when we're talking about money. That's all.
@_date: 2013-09-05 17:45:37
Perhaps I *am* biased: I don't think there's a 100% chance that bitcoin will succeed. I think there's a great chance, for all the reasons you mentioned, and I think the chance grows higher every day.
You're right about the reversal, of course: if HD TV came out first, who would want a regular one? But we haven't had TVs for nearly as long as we've had government issued currencies...
But I also think it would take a serious economic situation to get the bulk of the population to be on-board with decentralized digital currency. It's a huge leap forward for money but you can't underestimate the status quo.

Sensitive, eh?
I consider algorithmically controlled supply and advantage because at any point in time we know exactly how many coins have been mined and how many are "in the ground". Can we say the same about gold? Not with as much certainty.
Gold doesn't have any restrictions but if I'm going to physically own it, that means it can be physically stolen. That's all I meant.
I look at these boards and I see one phrase commonly repeated: "My coins aren't for sale at any price". You don't typically hear that about Dollars. 
That is all.
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:47:42
Bitcoin has many properties in common with gold: limited supply, an amount of effort/energy required to extract it.
Bitcoin also has many properties which make it superior to gold: algorithmically controlled supply, ease of storage, ease of transfer to 3rd parties across all geopolitical boundaries.

Wow, that's is awesome!
@_date: 2013-02-11 16:16:37
The biggest threat i think is government interference. While a govt taking action against bitcoin would drive a lot of underground traffic, it would make it very difficult to get average people to use it.

I like to believe that the people with families probably haven't put 50% in. 
The people with 50%+ are probably:
* People with a low networth
* Young people, without families
* People who have bitcoin-based businesses
At least, that's what I hope is that case

Coinbase also added a donation button to their merchant API

Try paying your bills in bitcoin and then come back and tell me that you don't need your Fiat anymore.
I don't think we are there quite yet...

Any tools you recommend or exchanges?

BitMinter already includes transaction fees, so i'm thinking about switching
@_date: 2013-02-04 21:25:29
While this is true, they actually store 87% of the deposited funds offline: 
The advantage, of course, with their approach is that coinbase-&gt;coinbase transactions happen instantly.
I'm not saying I advocate this approach, i just thought it was interesting
@_date: 2013-02-07 21:53:00


Is there a way to do this cheaper than bitinstant? 
I put something similar together and after taking into account the exchange fees and the bitinstant transfer fees, the margins get even slimmer.
For example, based on my calculations, you'd need a margin of &gt; 3% between sell and buy if you include the 1.49% bitinstant fee.
@_date: 2013-09-05 13:55:52
I think you're over-estimating the utility of bitcoin.
Do you really think that it's as useful as the internet itself? Or a cell phone?
Is the problem it solves or the opportunities it creates as dramatic as those two inventions? I doubt it. To the casual user, it doesn't provide that much, really. The US dollar is already ubiquitous and it's going to take a LOT to overcome that level of resistance to change. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:52:00
Dollars have fundamental value because they are "legal tender for all debts public and private" and because they can be readily exchanged for goods and services.

His point is that the monthly payment amount is fixed at the time the loan is issued. However, your household income would fall because each coin has more purchasing power over time.

Price your goods in USD and then convert to show prices in BTC.
When they pay, convert immediately to USD to avoid any price shift risk.

Looking at it's recent rise from 14/16 to 22+, i'm starting to wonder the same thing..
Probably not to $1 but maybe back down to $16-17?

Something about shovels and the gold rush

At this stage, with high volatility and a huge influx of buyers, it doesn't make sense to spend them.
I've always thought bitcoin was more of a commodity than a currency. Like digital gold. A store of value.

Categorize it as a "Transfer" since that's what it really is.
