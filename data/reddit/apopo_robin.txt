Very interesting. I actually registered my account with the Liberland website only yesterday. I'll have a wander over to and say hello. 
We're not intimately familiar with the landmine situation there but you're right that flooding can move explosive devices. Thanks for your time and help. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 10:56:28
This is awesome. I need to find out more. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 07:24:01
Sorry about that. We're pretty new to this. Can you kindly advise us on where the QR code should push you to? 
@_date: 2015-05-04 18:45:50
Thanks for your response. We have one in the donate section but until we get some decent traction it is difficult for us to give it space in the main navigation.

You're right that we haven't integrated bitcoin into the adoption system. We do accept bitcoins on our website though - [

Noted. Thank you. I will request the change. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 07:29:22
Thanks! Let me know if you have any questions, we're always happy to answer them.

All of this would offer a great insight into our work and the ability of our HeroRATs. They can be trained to do all kinds of awesome things. Sadly, the issue comes back to funding, but also our priorities. We're setup to tackle humanitarian problems in developing countries and putting on a giant rat exhibition may be a bit tricky to justify. If Elon Musk or Warren Buffett want to support it...

It's a tricky area, for example accepting donations in bitcoin varies by country and requires different types of accounting. It's an evolving area too which makes it more difficult to navigate than other types of income generation. With that, it's difficult to justify the necessary time requirement so I'm just trying to develop it in my own time. 
£5 a day is alright, I'd take that. Nearly 2k a year. As you say, it all counts.

Apologies, we're not trying to make anything difficult and we're learning best practices. Where should the QR code push you to? 
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:17:08
We can train them to [find survivors in disaster situations]( so we could probably train them to sniff out some network cabling. They tend to prefer bananas though. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 10:54:33
Easy. We have an abundance of bananas! 
@_date: 2015-05-05 07:26:35
Thanks for your kind words and support. We'll do our best to get involved in the community as regularly as we can. Noted on Mr Nakamoto, I'll take some time out this evening to read up on his philosophy.

Apologies, it was a poorly executed Jurassic Park reference. 


It could genuinely work. Generating the income would likely be the trickiest part. 


Thanks, I think I'm with you now.

I didn't know. Very interesting. We have a good number of staff members who use M-Pesa. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 07:29:46
Wonderful. Thank you so much, we're only small so public support really does make a big difference. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 07:23:03
Thanks! We saw bitcoin as an innovative solution that enables low resource communities around the world to better participate in the economic system. Bitcoin and mobile money like M-Pesa are really changing the game in Africa. 
We've not secured much but some other organisations have made some good money. The Water Project in Africa, for example, raised $30,000 worth but we don't know how they did it!

Rats are brilliant, charismatic, and extremely talented creatures. We like rats. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 12:18:59
Maybe one day my friend. As it stands there are a lot of landmines to clear up and our Tuberculosis detection project is growing rapidly. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 07:40:29


Clever girl. I'll let our R&amp;D people know! 


Our Mine Action activities are nominally through government contracts and supported by different donors but your idea could be viable. If we have a unit of bitcoin only funded rats we could implement it, the question would be around the inefficiency of waiting for new donations to start activities again. It would make quite an interactive project though, pay-as-you-go landmine detection. 


Aaaaaand you've lost me. Would you care to explain? 
@_date: 2015-05-05 09:37:16
Fellow brit? I like the RNLI. You're right, they've demonstrated the bitcoin option very well there. Thanks for the link, we'll use it to improve our own design. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 08:59:45
Thank you. We'll look into it right away. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 08:59:30
Absolutely. They'll free total strangers and share a piece of chocolate with them afterwards! 
We don't tend to engage with a lot of this type of research though as we don't want to be associated with some aspects of animal research. We understand it has a place, we just don't want anyone to be confused about what we're doing. Animal welfare is a top priority for us and our rats are treated like the heroes they are.
