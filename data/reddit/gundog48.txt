Perfectly valid phrase, or do you just disregard any dialect that isn't part of your narrow American experience?

Give it 5 years when LED bulbs get more mainstream, people are going to switch en masse due to the energy savings! I don't think most people are aware of the difference between each type of light source.
Also it is quite shitty as the main alternative when the regulation was passed were florescent bulbs which were useless and very harmful to the environment when disposed of.

Mine went the other way, found CFLs to be crappy but LEDs have been great to me. I used to run 20W halogens in my room and they'd blow all the time, replaced them with the cheapest 4W ebay LEDs I could find and they've been going strong apart from one lens which fell out! All our downstairs lighting is LED too now, although those are the more fancy units.
The thing about CFLs for me was the warm up time. I don't want to have to think about needing a light 10 mins in advance! LEDs are instant, efficient and bright! Only problem is diffusing the light properly. Do CFLs warm up quicker these days?

I have no idea why this is being downvoted- this is solid advice.
