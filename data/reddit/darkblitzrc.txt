Holy shit bitcoin IS the new vegan with comments like this. Getting tired of all this banks will fail bullshit. I said this on other posts. Atleast if you get your credit card gets stolen you can get help from someone (aka the bank) unlike bitcoin which you are screwed.

Making them legal wouldnt fix any issues. It would just make even more lazy and drugaddict people.

Please explain to me how you make heroin healthy. Im listening.

Also what about the LEGAL opiates that doctors prescribe for pain medication? Those are legal and im pretty sure it is created in a lab with scientists and not smugglers. And even with that there is a heroin addiction in the USA? Most of the addicts of fentanyl laced heroin start with LEGAL opiates prescribed medication.

No it wouldnt. There are certain drugs that should remain illegal, such as heroin, meth, crack, etc. Why? Because they rip apart families and people die from them. Wtf are you smoking? I know that alot of junkies support ross because he allowed them to prder drugs from the confort of their home but he did it for the money. All that bullshit that he wanted to change the world was that BULLSHIT. He did it for the money and nothing more.

I do agree that education is a good solution. The point of prision sentences most of the time is to make an example of what would happen if you tried doing that. Thats what happend with Ross, the governement decided to make an example out of him and welp there he is now.

Bitcoin is not going anywhere, the technology behind it is, but not bitcoin. If you think bitcoin will replace banks and everyone will be using it, you're in for a bad surprise. You see, governments like control. That's how they can keep track of almost everyone and also help people.
I know this doesn't relate to your post, but I felt like putting this here in the fanboys Reddit.
Wake up people.

LMFAO. Horrible meme and this is another reason why this sub is shit. Bitcoin is NOT a bank nor it will ever be unless it (somewhat) protects the consumer funds. 
I hate banks and wish they were gone but this is simply not the case. Yes we have moments like the 2008 crisis where millions of americans lost their money but that doesnt happen very often. In the normal day to day banks do actually protect you from credit card theft. This is core issue of bitcoin. Bitcoin CANNOT protect your funds, if they are stolen they are gone. My dad gets his american express cloned about 3 times per year, each time about 2000-3000$ are gone, do you think we are bankrupt? No we are not thanks to the bank. We would if all our wealth was in bitcoin. Look at the people of MTGox or Bitconnect, do you think they will get their money back? Gl with that.
Also anyone saying that bitcoin is 100% anonymous is lying to your face. If the government wants you, it WILL catch you. Keep teling yourself that transactions are 100% anonymous. 
Also i see we have extreme cases such as expropiation of goods but that doesnt happen EVERY single day.
Bitcoin is a currency which is based of the blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is HUGE and have unimaginable potential, but it has it flaws as well as bitcoin.
Dont be a fan boy, be logical.

Filled with hyper optimistic 30 year old males that got excited when they first got into the bitcoin hype. This and the ethereum reddit is cancer.

what the hell is this crap? I support bitcoin but not this criminal. He created a drug market, you know how many people die from drug related activities yearly? Not to mention how expensive and absurd the "war on drugs is". Give me a brake ffs he deserves it.
