That work around seems to be politics.

I understand.

Not the koolaid.

Trackable but not in a good way. It's a bit like TOR. TOR benefits the deep state more so than the activist. I can see why China hates the thing.

Artificial scarcity.

There is no limit to human relations, there should be no limit to who can create units of currency. It shouldn't be pointlessly monopolised by earlier adopters and those with the biggest server farms. Any one that thinks bitcoin is remotely radical is deluded or hoodwinked.

1) That's not relevant because "losses" will always be &gt;0.
2) Ultimately it shows an inadequacy of design. If you have to go to such convoluted lengths to maintain efficacy then there are inherent issues, especially as the Great Decimal Shift of 2110 will be a political. It seems the bitcoin equivalent to quantitative easing.

I think this proves the failings of bitcoin. I think it's totally inappropriate as a general currency failing as a metaphor, failing on a long enough time line. Money should model ephemeral human relations not existing as convoluted materialism.

Both are kludges, work arounds to counter systemic flaws. Thanks for Eco 101 though.

Who decides when and how the decimal shifts occur? Will creating receipts that look like 0.00000000001 be the smart thing to do? Bitcoin is autistic.

No. Inflation 0.1§ becomes 1§ becomes 10§ becomes, etc. Eventually 0.1, colloquially dimes and pennies, become obsolete.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:35:46
Sounds like reverse inflation.

Ahh, another autist fetishising the model oozing condescension, but I'm guessing you may not actually understand that. I'm criticising bitcoin design, I mustn't "get numbers", so I suppose I have to retort that you don't "get humans". I'm in the wrong place. No one has yet described how the protocol shifts the precision which from what I can tell has to be a political decision.
0.003 is the amount of bitcoins per head if all were distributed evenly over the world population.
Last criticism: new entrants, children, students, and the like, are left disenfranchised. What is created? A neoliberal dystopia with a capitalist elite and worker underclass. Bitcoin will be short lived, hopefully. It's only "legitimate" use is anonymous transfer and I wouldn't be surprised if the deepstate contrived such a money laundering service to fund various blackops.

No, properly abundant.
