Yes at the moment im working with glitchy apps that either half work when they want (cash app) or have had my weekly buy limit set to 0 for a reason i cannot explain on coinbase. ive thought about gemini but it looks too confusing, ive head you can buy through them and send but i cant for the life of me learn how to buy through the gemini app, but i started out on circle back in the day when they sold btc and they were decent, coinbase WAS the best and my most used for years and now this suddenly with the $0 weekly limit? Idk ive contacted support for coinbase and cash app but i highly doubt my case will even get read much less responded to with something that actually helps.

Crypto currency tech support is usually such a joke.

How do you buy btc through binance app? It is not user friendly, coinbase, cash app and circle back when they sold btc have always had easy user interface everything is clear and makes sense, but binance is nothing but squiggly lines and acronyms its honestly kinda confusing to navigate.

I can send it to other wallets?

Funny i thought so, called last night they said they have nothing to do with it... it sounds like someone didnt do their job correct when i asked my bank what the problem was or they straight up lied (navy federal)

Update: square cash app, now is letting me add money with a seperate mastercard debit card from vacu, im still sus that the bank was straight lying to me and it blocking the transaction from the vay fed visa, because theyve had problems with me and crypto currencies before.

Yeah i read the one im going to is 10-13% but i mean it is what it is i guess :/

I used another card (mastercard from vacu) and it worked fine, im baffled, and i really cant figure out how to contact their support team either because im not the type to talk to automated machines, only other way i see to contact cash app is through physical mail.

In terms of their fees is it like say if i bought for example: with a 10% fee on $180 theyre getting $10? Or am i misunderstanding the way they have their fees set up? Im sorry i meant to say theyre getting $18 lol.
