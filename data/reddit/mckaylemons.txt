This was around the time with all the structural and management changes to reddit and ryanxcharles who was leading the cryptocurrency stuff at reddit was I believe let go because the reddit vision of how it would fit in was changed/gone.

So much hate on you but it's true.  This was reposted twice and not even as links to the original source.  Ridiculous.

Kind of surprised more people aren't talking about DoCoMo's involvement.  Having just returned from Japan recently, the amount of cash people carry around is obscene and things like Suica cards can only help so much (and aren't even accepted in a lot of places).  Many places don't accept credit cards still and from my understanding, credit cards in general are not as popular in Japan.  
The benefits from having a "cash-like" currency, easy mobile payments, and existing (lower fee than CC) merchant processing integrations could potentially be pretty huge.  The technology to implement contactless payments is also already widespread and I could see the addition of bitcoin being a *relatively* painless process.

i think you're reading the chart wrong.. it's a total over the period so millions of xbt over a big period seems fair

AFAIK they didn't raise a round after YC so who knows where they're at product wise.
