Death is exactly why we should enjoy the present.

Nope. Vacations aren't supposed to last 20 years. Vacations are when you disengage with life to recharge and go back into it again. Two weeks, a month, maybe three months at the most. There's no meaning, no life purpose, no contributing to the world, on a vacation. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:34:20
I might be open to a short vacation if I can take my family along, but I still don't understand your point. Can you elaborate?

At least he's not ignorant of his ignorance.

Currently, on a long-term view, I see a volatile but sideways market with no dominant trend direction. The question is, will Bitcoin prevail and break out to the upside, or will it fail to the downside. 
Fundamentally, I'm bullish, but I also recognize that a lot of outside factors could ultimately affect the market (positively and negatively), so I only have invested what I can afford to lose.

Buying an L39 might be $350-500,000 (~1000 Bitcoin). If someone just wanted the owner to fly with the decals on for a while, it's whatever can be negotiated. It might only cost as much as buying the guy a couple tanks of fuel.

A "repeating pattern" sample size of two is woefully inadequate, by any statistical measure. That's not even a pattern.
I could also find you several indicators of a top - a "head and shoulders" pattern forming for example. We see what we want to see.

What is the recommended solution for accepting Bitcoin in face-to-face retail transactions?  
(Please include as much detail as possible on hardware, apps, wallet, exchanges, etc...)  Thanks.

Maybe he wants them to make an exception... to their policy... for his business.
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:22:11
I just did. It's a public database.

If more people are buying than selling, regardless of location or nationality, the price will continue to go up.

Thanks for your constructive comment. You've really enhanced the conversation.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:20:56
What are you having trouble understanding here? I can try to dumb it down further if need be.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:11:06
Sounds like you and I have different methodologies. Nothing wrong with that. I'll stick with what I've got though, thanks.

When you say you sold at $6k, do you mean you went short? Is there a way to do that with BTC yet? I assume someone would have to create a derivative instrument of some sort.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:23:29


Yep, that works for me.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:11:24
I don't mind looking at a log view if I'm going to view the entire history. I understand it and can see reasons for it. But I didn't get in early enough to buy at $1 or even $2. My average buy price is still plenty relevant on a linear scale. And like I said, I base entry/exit signals on 90 days of data, so I have no need for log scale most of the time.  
Like I said to someone else, if that's how you like to view it, go right ahead. I'm not trying to stop anyone from using log scale, it's just not my preference.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:51:00
You might be right. I've used linear scaling on charts for 20+ years, long before Bitcoin, and that's what I'm used to. I'm just comfortable with seeing it that way. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:08:45
Real in the sense that a move halfway from the top represents half the dollar value. With log charts, a move halfway down the scale means your thousands of dollars are now worth pennies.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:28:25
Let's see if I can make this simple. Find the 20,000 price level on a linear chart. Move your eyes halfway down the Y axis, and you'll find 10,000. Now, look at the same thing on a log scale. If you move your eyes halfway down the scale from 20,000, you'll end up closer to 20. According to math I've done in the past, 20 is not 50% of 20,000. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:03:42
Be sure to let them know this is their best opportunity to buy in over a year. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:34:59
I didn't even criticize its use. All I did was mention my preference and why. Sounds like some people on here have much stronger opinions about it than I do.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:31:56


You mean like 5 years ago? I don't care much about that (and I actually have a background in technical trading). The important price data for me is within the last 90-180 days. I don't need or want log scale for that time frame.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:42:07
I apologize that my simple answer to question caused you such anxiety.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:02:15
Since the first one shows real dollar value, that's my choice.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:15:31
Are you actually saying that using one price scale is "reality" and the other isn't? 
Do you realize that it's just two different ways to look at the same data, and neither is right or wrong?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:37:28
You can't. Any value you put on it would be pure spec-u-lat-...  Oh, hey, I guess that's why they're called speculators. 
Seriously, any pricing model you could come up with would have so many wild assumptions that it would have a very low level of reliability. In a macro view though, Bitcoin has a limited supply and growing demand. As it becomes used more and more (in spite of China) it should continue to increase in value. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:41:23
Leverage? Because what Bitcoin really needs is something to amplify the volatility, right?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:49:33
Most people don't have a solid understanding of what they're doing when they start trading on margin. That leverage can undo everything. You see it all the time in the futures markets. Some new customer will open a $5k account then margin the whole thing. Next thing they know they're having to cover a margin call for many times the amount they thought they were risking. For most people, the volatility we're seeing in Bitcoin is plenty of risk, you don't need to magnify it. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:37:04
"According to Chinese news reports, the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, met Monday with more than 10 of the country’s biggest third-party payment processing companies, ordering them to stop all transactions involving digital currencies." 
It doesn't explicitly say it, but I think this also means the Chinese regulators are restricting financial institutions from dealing with the Bitcoin exchanges. I actually think I saw that somewhere, but maybe I'm making assumptions.

The only have it from shutting down Silk Road. I wouldn't say that was a conscious investment choice. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:49:37
Who hurt you buddy? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:28:35
Or, I bought 2 bitcoin at about $1000. I look at the current price and multiply by 2 to know the value. That math is so easy I can do it in my head. The percentage gain (or loss) is of little importance to me, but I can figure that pretty easily too. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:18:46
I like it when the Y scale represents my stack of money. Does that make sense?  
If you like log scale, by all means go ahead and use it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:23:23
I think Bitcoiners in China will find a way around the regulations. It may involve a few more steps through a few other currencies, but Bitcoin will flow like water around these roadblocks. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:19:26
This is sensible advice. Have fun with it for a while, then give it back. Leave the rest in Bitcoin, or move to some other investment. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:07:40
Aside from consumption, the reason people buy anything, from corn to real estate, is that they hope to profit from higher prices in some way. 
Buy a dozen eggs for $1.00, convert to four omelettes, sell for $3.50 each, pay your expenses, profit, repeat.  
Even for the consumer, the value of eating an omelette was greater than the value of $4 in his pocket. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:28:44
Certainly not all of them have foreign accounts already in place, and they can't use a Chinese bank directly, no matter which Bitcoin exchange it comes from.

| finding the best place to buy that has the lowest price is going to be crucial.
If most long term predictions are half right, it wont matter that you got the lowest price, just that you got in. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:46:18
Yes, but if it's coming from Bitstamp, the Chinese bank will reject it. The account holder will need a middleman as an extra step.
