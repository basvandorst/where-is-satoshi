The app I am using has an option to create a channel, so I believe it functions as both a wallet and a node. I could see it on the test net once I created the channels.

Do you know what the best lightning node to run is? Is it the ZAP application? I tried the windows lightning app desktop and was able to open a channel and buy coffee from the test site but I wasn't real happy with how that app worked. Somehow I went to bed having failed to open a channel and in the morning I had 5 channels opened. Does ZAP have better features or a better interface? Thanks

Aren't they down for maintenance?

I don't understand the fascination with doing small transactions with bitcoin. It was cool several years ago but for now I still have visa, and Paypal and cash and many other options. Granted I would like the fees to be a bit lower but this is the mass adoption phase, there are bound to be snags along the way and I would rather they get sorted out correctly rather than quickly but at a negative cost. Bitcoin doesn't even work correctly until it hits close to a million dollars a coin. Who wants to buy something only to have the cost halve in a week or a day. Can you imagine the nightmare of returns for people accepting bitcoin of customers returning items when their $1000 laptop suddenly costs them $2000. Percentage fluctuations have to become more stable. So for now we can only invest and hold.

How much bitcoin can you mine per month using a single S9? I used to mine with graphics cards and briefly owned a couple of jalapenos but they arrived too late. i did enjoy mining but I figure it just won't be worth it.
