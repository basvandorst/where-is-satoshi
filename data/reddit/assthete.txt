Is there anyway we can check when the fbi sell their coins by checking the movement of silkroad owners bitcoins through blockchain.info? How do we know they havent started selling them slowly through exchanges or otherwise?

inflation does not line the pockets of those at the top as you say. its the exact opposite. the wealthier you are the more you lose from inflation.

Rich people invest smartly with their money because they can afford advisors and hedge funds so their wealth obviously increases relative to inflation. But your making another assumption in your comments that their asset prices rise above inflation.
Also my definition of the poor were people with debt.
Where I live nominal minimum wage increases with inflation. US inequality is just terrible

I agree with you that money printing and decrease in interest rates cause inflation. However this directly impacts the wealthy. Think about it. If you have a million dollars in the bank and would you rather the interest rate was high or low? Unanticipated inflation redistributes wealth from creditors to debtors. Basic econ mate

Yes could someone explain why gox prices are so much lower right now? 
I understand that gox prices used to be higher (before they stopped btc withdrawls) because it was near impossible to get usd out of gox so people had to buy btc and send btc to elsewhere and then withdraw from there. Thus creating a higher demand for btc in gox. 
But why is it so low right now?

Yes they obviously invest their money cos the interest rates suck. But low central bank interests affect other investments such as gov bonds and corporate bonds.
I think we had a different definition of poor. Your poor keep most of their wealth in dollars, my poor dont have any wealth at all. They are in debt.

is there a way for us to know if and when satoshi dumps some/all his coins? that would increase the supply and drive the price down.
ive read on some forum that people are keeping on eye on his coins cos he mined the first blocks so we know if he ever dumps his coins, but cant remember where i read it or how they keep on eye on those coins.
