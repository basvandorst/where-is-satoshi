Not to mention it DOES affect everyone else, too.
Greece would be the first domino, with the default spreading to other EU countries and eventually the US. The derivatives market is a house of cards, and Greece is one of the bottom cards.

You should use the Qt toolkit so you don't have to maintain separate code bases for the different platforms. Write once, compile everywhere.

Wonder how many bits a 7 yr account gets me? :)   I'm down to tip it forward.

lol no.   price swings like these are par for the course. I facepalm everytime I see people get worked up about 10% increases in price when those same people ignore 10% decreases in price.

bitcointaxes.info lets you export to a TFX file. This file can be imported by TurboTax Premiere (desktop only).

I'm okay with manual entry so long as it won't clobber my stock options I've already entered in turbotax or something.

I think it's silly to have a hard-to-counterfit design, when you can't counterfit bitcoin like that, anyways.  
  
Pretty dope design for fiat, though.

I'm a user, quick question. How do you guys make money?
Like the app, just curious.
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:59:40
Major props. I hadn't even begun putting a spreadsheet together. What a pleasure to see a web app already created with so many complete features! Thanks a lot for your work.
