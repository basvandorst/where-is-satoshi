Due to low volume if a big buyer steps in and buys at once the price shoots up like that. Then sellers see the high price and step in to correct the price back down. It's a normal thing with anything that has low volume.

Did you fail economics? With a deflationary currency people want hold hold onto it because the value rises. It results in no investments and hoarding of money. With and inflationary currency (Venezuala) people rush to spend every dime before the price goes up. The "time traveler" makes sense on a -2% economic growth.

When it comes to crypto at this stage in the game noone should trust anyone with anything. Even if the coins stay in the persons wallet how can tge client be guaranteed you dont sell them for $1 on a decentralized exchange just to mess with them?

Someone is mad that they didnt buy at 3200, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, and 8000. You will be the one buying at 100000 because it is going to 1000000.

The reason is simple on why the economy did not shrink while the gold standard was in place. The gold was set to a specific price. Gold did not change by 10% in one day or even in a year. This resulted in a good asset to have as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin in realtive to fiat is not pegged. So while Bitcoin is volitile people will be crazy to spend it as if the hold onto their bitcoin they could buy much more later on. After all the bitcoins are mined and if bitcoin flattens out in value we can use it like we did the gold standard. Until this it is deflationary and people will hoard it.

Thats what I do. I just dont trust anyone with access to money. For people like me you may want to check into multi sign wallets. I may go for sometging like that. I would like a service to help grow my holdings but I just cant get over the control part.
