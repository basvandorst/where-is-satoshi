I mean, I want it high as possible, but this was hilarious.

I think I did photo ID verification. Just go buy one and take the plunge. It costs five bucks for the card, and you have to put $20 down.....that's it. Green Dot pre paid Visa worked and works just fine for me. You just wont be able to spend much at first.

Allow me to correct myself...I mean in a few minutes. Lol.

Yes, but that was the .com bubble, as you just stated. But when did the internet ever bubble?

Thats not "a Senator". That's bad ass Elizabeth mf'n Warren. She be letting those guys have it.....every day. I hope she runs for Pres.

Why do people keep putting a stock market analysis on something that isn't necessarily even a business...or a corporation. I don't even think it's all that fair to compare it to gold or silver...even though thats what I hear and read all the time. This is some new frontier shit...like how the internet was in its early stages.

Ummm....soooo...you're expecting BTC to hit 15....even though its looking like it might hit 17k by tonight?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:18
I mean, I bought BTC and LTC in September. So I'm still a newbie. But when I bought in it wasn't to "get rich quick". My 20 year old cousin kept mentioning crypto this, crypto that, "people are getting rich". And I thought it was bullshit. It wasn't until I took a couple hours to read and understand the tech until it clicked like...holy shit...this shit is forever. Then I made a buy. Everyone I try to talk to now about crypto and how beneficial it could be to them reacts similar to how I did initially. No one I know is biting even though they know people are/were getting rich/comfortable. Even after showing them my own money tripled, they're still skeptics. It seems as if, they're not willing to buy into it because they don't understand the tech and what it's for. So I dont know about your hypothesis on new comers. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:10
So you don't see BTC reigning supreme in the future? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:43:05
oh damn.....that 15 coming man!

Yea I'm making that "bet".

Around $2,200 a year.

If Bitcoin was at 13k or higher I wouldn't be thinking about selling for Bitcoin. And there's alot of fees associated with selling for USD. I'd rather just take it in Crypto.

lol. dang you mad.
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:54:05
Very easy. There's not a lot of high paying jobs here. But there are low crime, homeowner neighborhoods with nice houses and big backyards. My house happens to be in one of those neighborhoods.
@_date: 2018-08-07 18:08:57
Northwestern PA. Needs mostly cosmetic fixes on the inside. I have another property Im fixing up as well and I cant sustain both at the same time so I need to let one go. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:59:55
Where you live?
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:59:23
No I just want to use the money from this property to help pay for the fixes on another property I have that's actually worth the complete overhaul. This is a good strong house but no driveway. Great for a rental or business since it's zoned for both.

60k county assessment, but that value is inflated due to property taxes being the best way local governments know how to bankroll themselves.

Gorilla market def my new term when crypto gets dipping

Northwest, PA. In a really good neighborhood. Just in a rust belt city with a pretty bad economy. Needs mostly cosmetic work on the inside. Reason for selling is I have another house I'm trying to fix as well and I can't sustain both properties at once. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:17:01
In the condition its in with some drywall here and there...$600-$800. After $5k-$10k into it, $12-$14 easy.

It's not meant to be taken seriously, obviously. But daaang...you're super mad over there. At least they're not pulling up charts in an attempt to come off as genuine cryptoanalysts. I can't count how many youtubers there are with 50k-250k subscribers who manipulate viewers into thinking they actually know what they're talking about. IMO channels like that, do much more harm than 2 amateurs venting anxieties between one another that many of us feel to ourselves. Hodge twins are just harmless fun for crypto. They don't know shit like we don't know shit, the only difference is they film it. Cool it with the pretentiousness, you're not as smart as you think you are. Relax and have a damn laugh why don't ya?

Draper and Byrne made some good points I agree. But Tett and Posner obviously just knew how to win the crowd. I don't think they would've been able to get away with that against an Antonopolous or Buterin.

Yea I kinda lost it when he said that. Lol

Uhhh I think the sole purpose of posting on youtube is to get more views. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:59:34
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:36:44
Yes. I'm not saying what Posner and Tett said was true...by a long shot. I'm just saying they were better practiced in arguing points than Draper and Byrne. I think Posner wrote like 30 books and Tett is a Doctor of Social Anthropology. Draper and Byrne just got outclassed.  
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:03:54
Damn, dude. Are you Ok?

That near 20% drop off from the pro vote at the end got me so mad though...lol.

I believe so. Send options are on the site.

Bought some at the dip around 2pm east coast time today when it was in the 4200's. It was lower an hour before that I believe, but I still made good time. Honestly, I think people are nuts not to throw at least a couple hundred bucks in weekly or bi weekly. I don't care what anyone say, bit won't lose, Eth won't either.

 I bought bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin through coinbase just a few days ago with my prepaid visa. They will deposit two small amounts in your account. You go check what the amounts were and report that number back. Once you do that you can make a purchase, but with limits on how much. You can then increase your purchase limit by taking taking an in site pic of your id. Then after that you have to spend a certain amount to get greater increases. Like they just told me If I put $400 more on the $500-$600 I already have in, my limit will increase to $5,000. The only drawback with using a prepaid debit card is that you can only buy coins. You can't sell them back into the account. You have to use pay pal for that.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:22:30
You mean 4600!
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:32:09
lol. Yea it just seemed weird as hell to me.

Surprised Im the only one that brought it up.

I'm thinking of selling two of my houses for Bitcoin. Is there a website or service that handles crypto escrow?
