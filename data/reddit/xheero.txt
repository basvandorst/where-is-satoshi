No different than any other wallet. When you want to send your coins to an exchange that exchange is going to require 2-6 confirmations before you can actually submit a sell order with those coins. 
Does not matter what wallet you send from. What matters is the mempool state and the fee you pay on the Bitcoin transaction along with how long it takes to mine the blocks.
If you are planning to wait until a big price spike, the mempool tends to fill up with people moving coins to do exactly what you'd be doing with means you have to pay a way higher fee or wait a lot longer.

Well, it is a known vulnerability, so probably a Bitcoin client programmer like MTGOX would employ to write their specialized client software.

It will certianly put a downward force on the price, but that isn't OPs point. OP is trying to say that they won't put all of the coins on the market immediately at market price orders. That is...they them at reasonable prices over a period of time so as not to induce a massive crash in the value of the coins.

They had seized only a portion of the silk road coins. They actually transfered those to their own keys. There is a very large amount of bitcoins they were not able to get the private keys for and do not have ownership of.

It is a fucking risk man. Not a huge risk, but a risk nonetheless. Don't just think about it from your perspective "buy and hold long term" but try to think about it from the perspective of other people, people that would be negatively affected by a very large dip in the price, even if the dip was temporary.
@_date: 2014-01-13 01:54:51
Not necessarily. One of the reasons that companies offer gift cards is because there is a tendency for people to lose their gift cards, or leave some smallish balance that never gets spent. Add that to the money saved on fees and they probably save 5% or more on gift cards compared to credit cards. So then they can sell gift cards to gyft at 4% discount which gyft sells to users at 3% discount. Only thing that the customer gives up are the protections offered by the credit card companies, and whatever cost they may have paid to buy BTC in the first place.
TLDR - fucking fees.

Transferring funds to a random payment address and then to the payee won't fool a real attempt at blockchain analysis. If it did, we wouldn't need tumblers.

If 99.9% of mining hashrate quits for 2016 blocks, it will take 1000 times as long to mine those 2016 blocks. What should take about 2 weeks to mine would actually take about 2000 weeks.
So 2000 weeks later, the difficulty drops to .1% of what it was. Also, for the duration of the 99.9% shutdown, it would take about a week to get one confirmation on a transaction.
Basically, there is no money to be made by having that many people stop mining at once.
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:55:36
You don't have to use an exchange or a payment processor like Coinbase. You retain the ability to send any amount of bitcoins to anyone else in the world instantly. In the long term, fees might rise and there will probably be a balance between fees and how many transactions are done on/off blockchain.

I have my own wallet as well as a coinbase wallet...you kind of have to have a wallet with coinbase if you want to buy/sell any coins through them.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:30:52
That is a bad idea. What happens when they move the BTC to some random address and claim that you are the one who owns that address and you stole the coins? You have literally no proof since both you and the buyer would have the private key...either of you could have taken the bitcoins. Or even a mail worker who opened the piece of mail could copy down the private key.
That is the problem with paper wallets...the money isn't stored on the piece of paper, but rather the piece of paper has the "passcode" to access the money, and there is nothing stopping you from making your own copy of that "passcode" when you create the paper wallet.
What you need is a documented payment address directly from the seller so that you can go back to the blockchain and show the specific transaction where you sent them bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:18:15
They have never been on an exchange, but every person trading bitcoin has done so assuming that Satoshi has 800k BTC, and that even though the chance is small, there is still a chance he could decide to cash in some or all of his coins and tank the market. That risk reduces the value people are willing to pay for BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:38:56
Key word is "support at lower prices." Satoshi can dump a shit ton of coins and tank the market down to a much lower price point. Then, all of my Bitcoins are less valuable. That is a risk that I take when I buy Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-01-16 21:13:28
I highly doubt it would take a year. If they go through a 3rd party payment processor, it is actually quite simple to do. Sure, there is still a lot to be worked out, but if they really want to do it they can probably get it done if a few months. The biggest question is whether or not Coinbase/Bitpay are capable of handling the volume that Amazon would bring.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:02:49
How so? Users of Bitcoin still retain the option to hold their Bitcoin on their own instead of with some online wallet service and to make their own transactions directly on the blockchain.

What? You assume that if Overstock did well, I would automatically attribute it to Bitcoin instead of looking at the evidence?
Overstock has big issues. Accepting Bitcoin is cool, but it isn't going to solve those issues, and it isn't going to add to those issues either. A small boost to revenue is all that it amounts to.
But I don't even know why I typed this to an obvious troll.

@_date: 2014-01-30 19:49:18
Why not use the traditional payment systems that can handle that volume to do off-chain bitcoin transactions? 
We cannot expect the population at large to really embrace interfacing directly with their Bitcoins. They would rather pay for some service that offers simplicity, fraud protection, and insurance.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:33:14
Those companies have smart people. They aren't going to write insurance policies without fully understanding what they are insuring. In the beginning, they will probably set policy limits in fiat and not bitcoin.

Still waiting to hear if you dropped out of math in the second grade or not...
@_date: 2017-02-13 22:18:26
There is a compromise here. On one side, people want fast confirmations with low transaction fees. That means for them, they want...fuck idk, infinite block size? Or in general, the largest size that won't break the entire bitcoin network.
On the other hand, miners don't want that. They like low blocksizes because that means less storage and bandwidth they need to pay for, and fewer transactions means higher fees which go to the miners. They want block sizes to stay as low as possible without killing the functionality of the bitcoin network.
There is an entire range of block-sizes that can work technically. One side of the fight wants the top end of the range. The other side of the fight wants the bottom end of that range. The compromise should be somewhere in the middle, but we are seeing the power that mining hashrate gives people over this, leading to nothing changing at all (miners get what they want, the lowest blocksize that is possible...1MB).

5.8 million users. They launched October 2012 (1593 days ago). That means on average, 3640 new users a day since the day they launched. And I don't think it's a surprise that they add users more frequently now compared to years ago since they are much larger and more well known.

I wouldn't doubt the halvening plays into this, but there is no way that's the only factor.
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:09:04
Exactly. I've been in bitcoin from near the very beginning. Volatility has been steadily decreasing. Every-time it makes a quick jump or crash, people freak out. But the volatility now is absolutely nothing compared to the volatility years ago. Some of those bubbles were absolutely fucking brutal and make this jump look completely tame.
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:22:00
Even if the Euro collapsed, why the FUCK would bitcoin go to 1 million?
It wouldn't. Stop spouting off insane pipe dreams, it makes bitcoin users look like crazies.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:16:54
Funny how these "crashes" almost always directly follow a big spike. And then after the "crash" it settles at a price higher than before the big spike. It's almost like you could view those as one singular event where the price rapidly increases but there is big volatility during that period.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:19:49
Exactly. Price spikes then corrects downward and settles at a price higher than before the spike. Don't buy during these periods unless you are looking to do hour by hour trading hoping to profit from the temporary volatility.
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:13:40
Ah the good ole "I'll pretend I was trolling the entire time so I don't look as stupid!"

@_date: 2017-01-26 21:16:32


Literally impossible. Not "very questionable."
Let me ask the question one last time for everyone here trying to defend OP. How the FUCK would bitcoin go to 1 million just because the Euro collapses?
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:01:24
Why do I have to do the math to prove your point?
And the real question is why the fuck would Bitcoin take over 100% of the worlds derivatives market? If the Euro collapses those countries go right back to their own local currencies.
You really don't think very well, do you?
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:22:19
The seed words are basically the private key...they get run through a publicly known algorithm to re-generate the private keys. Someone gets those seed words? They have your private keys.
It's an easy form of backup. Instead of writing down a long ass random string of letters and numbers, you just have to write down some words.
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:23:03
That is how it almost always goes. Spike up, correct down, some turbulence and then it settles higher than it was before the spike.
Don't buy during the volatile periods like this unless you are trying to day trade bitcoin, trying to make profit off the volatility.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:05:40
All bitcoins in existence are tied to or "owned" by a public/private keypair. Whoever has the private key can spend the bitcoins associated with that private key however they want. The public key...don't worry about it, it's part of the protocol but not something you need to protect, it's meant to be public.
Bitcoins on an exchange or on an online wallet service are being held by that company on your behalf, similar concept to a bank but generally without government protections like FDIC.
If you run your own wallet program, it stores the private key and that means those bitcoins will never move unless you spend them, or someone else obtains that private key and spends them. If you lose your private key...like your hard drive dies and you have no backup or seed words to regenerate the key, those bitcoins will be forever unspendable.
Storing an unencrypted private-key in a CSV file is a really bad idea.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:14:22
I don't view this as a crash. I view the spike/crash combo as a singular event. Bitcoin does this repeatedly. It spikes up. Then corrects down and settles somewhere higher than before the spike and lower than the peak of the spike.
The only time it's important to treat the spike and drop separately is if you are trying to play the market selling high before it corrects back downward or something like that. Long term holders like me don't care because overall it's a solid price increase. I buy my bitcoin when the market is NOT going through one of these events. Then I wait.
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:09:21
Are you 12?
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:04:21
Maybe people who don't believe it's priced in went on a buying spree trying to get rich. It's been a couple days. We need to see where it settles long term. Come back at the end of the year and we can see how well it was priced in.
Also, there can very easily be other external influences on the price independent from the halvening.
Just because something is priced in, doesn't mean it's accurately priced in and doesn't mean it will stay accurately priced in if it is.
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:45:22
So my question stands. How the FUCK would bitcoin go to 1 million just because the Euro collapses?
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:49:22
For the fourth fucking time:
How the FUCK would bitcoin go to 1 million just because the Euro collapses?
I'm still waiting for someone to answer that with an answer that isn't just "I LOVE BITCOIN ITS GONNA TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!!LOL IM TWELVE!!!"
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:09:48
The public key is public. Everyone already knows it. The private key is what determines if you control the bitcoins or not. You can't spend bitcoin with only the public key. And every public key that has ever been involved in a transaction is recorded on the blockchain.
Proving ownership of the private key is how you prove that you own, or that you have the ability to spend the bitcoins associated with the key. But you can't give out your private key. So you sign a unique message with the private key and the message signature can be verified with the public key.
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:50:59
You don't owe taxes until you realize the gain. Which means selling it. Or if you spend bitcoin online to purchase something, whatever the conversion rate is at the time you spend it you'd owe capital gains.
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:37:52
It happens every time. Bitcoin has a big spike for a few days. Then it crashes back down, and settles at a spot somewhere between the price before the spike, and the peak price before it crashed. If you don't want to lose money, don't buy during the spike, you risk it correcting down to a price lower than what you bought in at.
The best time to buy bitcoin is when a spike is NOT happening.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:33:41
Are you going to answer my question? Or pretend like Bitcoin and the Euro are the only two currencies in existence and that a country would not be able to create it's own new currency if they are put in that situation, meaning the country could ONLY turn to bitcoin.

I use coinbase in a limited fasion. They provide a great service. I'm okay with them operating within our existing legal and regulatory framework. I'm okay with them complying with legal court orders. I'm not using their service for illegal shit.
And I still have my own private wallet where only I control the keys. And I keep most bitcoins in this wallet. And no one would be able to track these coins back to me.
The more and more that bitcoin grows, the more and more that bitcoin wallet services and exchanges will be forced to comply with laws and regulations that apply to their services.
@_date: 2016-11-30 22:05:03

You mean lawful exchanges ready to comply with court orders? Yeah, we do. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 21:24:40
Coinbase was created with the goal of taking a more traditional and lawful approach to creating an online wallet service and exchange service. Back when they launched, wallet services and exchanges were getting hacked or shutting down and scamming users left and right.
If you think the government is evil and that banks are evil, why the fuck would you use coinbase? As for those people not doing anything they care to hide from the government with their bitcoins, it can provide a valuable service.


Why? Coinbase is in it for the profit, and is looking towards the future. As bitcoin has grown and continues to grow, it will further integrate with the more traditional banking methods, which are of course subject to law. That is why coinbase is steaking that position out.
For every person like you who is obsessed with privacy and secrecy and thinks that banks are the government are out to get you, there is a person who doesn't have issues with the banking system or the government and sees bitcoin as a shady black market internet currency. To them, coinbase brings more legitimacy.
You can avoid coinbase and use your own private wallets. I can use coinbase or another similar service. Both are valid options (the greatness of bitcoin) and both further the growth of bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-11-29 04:57:42
I think bitcoin makes illegal transference of money while hiding the money easier than anything. 
Have the dirty corruption coins sent to a 1 time address you've never used before. Then to a coin mixer. Then to whatever private address you want that people can't directly associate with you.
Sure cash is even better because there is no ledger at all, but with cash you have to physically exchange it in person. With bitcoin you could send large transactions without that worry.
At least that is my thought. There is a reason why bitcoin works so well for illegal online activities like gambling or buying drugs. It's a more convenient cash because it can be used electronically without any central control, and all you have to do is make sure you don't leave anything on the blockchain that links back to your personal identity. Keep your bribe and corruption money separate from your legally obtained money, using different addresses and wallets. Just like you do now with cash (if you do that).
@_date: 2016-11-28 20:20:43

Bitcoin has the ability to dominate the money transmission market because you can send a transaction for an extremely low fee. Why would I not use a traditional bank or money transfer service if Bitcoin has high fees?
Sure, Bitcoin fees are still lower than other services. But as fees increase, third party bitcoin payment services will gain more and more power over the market because they can do off-chain transactions as part of their service, and because users who don't know much about the technical side of bitcoin can avoid the issues with not paying a big enough fee or having to worry about backing up their wallet in 3 places and keeping it safe.
If there was nothing we could do, I'd be all with you OP. Bitcoin still has significantly lower fees. BUT WE CAN DO SOMETHING AND THE COMMUNITY JUST WONT COME TO AN AGREEMENT. People are rightfully pissed.

Western nations have the least need for bitcoin because they tend to have stable and safe currencies to begin with. Compare that to places with hyperinflation or cash transaction limits or governments seizing people funds like Greece, and I think it's pretty obvious why the West wouldn't have the need to trailblaze a new currency, at least not on the same level as some other nations.

Coinbase is relatively safe and reliable. Top notch in terms of bitcoin banking and wallet services. I would STILL suggest that you treat coinbase as an exchange, and as a convenient wallet service. Which means moving most of your coins to a privately held wallet.
Coinbase is reliable and stable but just based on the history of bitcoin thefts and scams I wouldn't trust them to hold the coins simply because I personally have the ability to hold the coins myself and to keep them safer. That isn't a knock on Coinbase. It's just reality, but I wouldn't blame you for keeping your coins with Coinbase either.

Donations to a political campaign are made public by law. The FEC mandates that and audits those records for any illegal donations. How can you tell right now if a donation is tied to some specific private promise (indicating possible corruption) or if they are just a donation? And how does that change with bitcoin and the blockchain?
I get it man. But just admit when you are wrong about something. It won't stop corruption. Just like authorities haven't been able to use it to find and arrest every criminal using bitcoin to buy drugs on the internet.

Coinbase is trying to operate in a 100% legally compliant manner. If you don't like that then don't do business with them, that's my view. If bitcoin will continue to grow, businesses will more and more be forced to operate within legal and regulatory standards.
You can still send and receive bitcoins with your own wallet program completely indepedently from any banking or payment processing organization. That isn't changing.

Bitcoin has been getting more and more stable over it's lifetime. I was there for the early boom/bust cycles and compared to those, Bitcoin is very stable right now. But compared to USD or other major currencies? Yeah, it's less stable.
The more widespread Bitcoin becomes, the more stable it will get. Back then, it didn't take much in terms of capital to pump the price. Nor did it take much to start a bust. One or two big players could easily do it.
It's way harder to do now, or I should say that the affect that one or two big players could have is nowhere near what it was in the past. It's becoming more stable and will continue to become more stable barring some unforeseen event.

That isn't how it works. As computing power increases, hashing schemes used increase the difficulty to perform a hash.

MtGox is switching to a different hashing algorithm with multiple run throughs that greatly increases the computing power needed to do one hash.

The idea is that bigger fees make people not send as many transactions. Many transactions are unnecessary or could be done off-chain in various ways.

I don't think he is owed an apology when he hasn't even proved anything. The signature proof was already proven to be publicly available through what is effectively a replay attack. Then there is the false script.
The obvious reaction to just the evidence he has provided is that he is a scammer. I don't see why people need to apologize for thinking that he is a scammer if the evidence he presents makes him look like a scammer because it isn't actual evidence of his identity. He could have simply chosen to sign a messages with the genesis block private key saying "Chris Wright is Satoshi." and boom, irrefutable evidence that he at least possesses Satoshi's private keys. And that is the evidence everyone has been expecting forever. And he hasn't even given us a reason why he hasn't provided that evidence and instead provided false evidence.
Someone as smart as Satoshi wouldn't fuck up the cryptographic evidence of his identity like this.

There are a lot of reasons. Interface is one. Quantity of trade is another. Also, despite how everyone depict mtgox, they handled this breach quite well. Passwords were salted and hashed (strong password = you are safe). Coming back, people still have the same bitcoin/USD balance. 
Then there is the revamp. Stronger security measures and whatnot. If they can weather a breach like what they just went through, and then revamp their security, they can persevere for the long term.

He had specifically said he provided the USB stick. He didn't say anything about having provided the laptop other than that it was a new laptop. Without control of the laptop there are plenty of techniques that Craig could have used to deceive Gavin. Install a trusted certificate, redirect the electrum webpage to his own site that looks like the official electrum site, download a modified installer, and boom.
Did Gavin bring a copy of the SHA hash of the electrum download? Did he verify it against the Electrum download? Even then what if the hash generating program on the computer was itself altered to give the right output?
There are just far too many possibilities here for Craig to have deceived Gavin. If Craig has those private keys, it should take him 2 minutes to sign a message with one of those keys and post it on the Internet.

How is it a mistake? All the cryptographic proof provided so far has been debunked. Satoshi is an expert in cryptography. He would know how to cryptographically prove his identity the correct way. If not, he wouldn't have been able to create Bitcoin in the first place.
Here is what he needs to do: Sign a message with the private key from the genesis block, or from some of the other first few blocks. 100 times simpler than what Chris Wright has done, and it is the best proof that could possibly be provided.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:36:59
Notice that he allegedly provided cryptographic proof to Gavin and those news outlets so that he could take public credit for being SN, but for whatever reason has refused to provide cryptographic proof to the same public he is trying to convince? And he was very careful to make sure that Gavin and those news outlets weren't able to keep that cryptographic proof? It's not like he has to reveal anything sensitive to prove he is SN, just sign a message with a private key.

Yeah they should honestly just back out of their statement that Craig is SN. Gavin can say he still can't know for sure, but it's likely he was fooled by a well planned ruse by Craig. Matonis seems to be sticking to it a lot harder.

If he is sorry for them taking shit for being deceived, well guess what. The world will happily believe they weren't deceived, simply provide the exact same proof that was provided to them by signing a message with the private key from block 1.
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:59:36
No shit. Which is why having those keys doesn't mean it's 100% certain the person is Satoshi. It's just by and far the most proving bit of evidence that could possibly be provided. Nitpicking the littler details is what should happen after that proof is provided.
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:19:10
Yeah that's what I said...
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:04:38


Not to mention that this is supposedly the proof he provided in private to Gavin, so that Gavin would go out and tell the public that he is Satoshi. So there is obviously no intent to hide that he has the ability to sign messages with that private key. So what the fuck would releasing a signed message to the public saying "Craig Wright is Satoshi" do that would cause him to not want to release that message to the public?
Of course his excuse to Gavin was that he didn't want it leaked before the official announcement. But you would think the official announcement would include, you know, a message signed with that private key that he has 'proven' his possession of to Gavin by using it to sign a message....
I'm seriously sitting here racking my brain trying to come up with any sort of reason why Craig would have done things the way he has. I cannot think of any explanation where he is actually Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:07:44
If Satoshi made a conscious decision to delete the only proof of his identity, I'm simply never going to believe anyone saying that they are Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:51:33
Based on Gavin's account of how the private demonstration went down, it's quite possible for him to have been deceived by Craig in a very real looking manner. And he thought that Craig was just going to post a message signed with the block 1 key when he announced, just like he had shown Gavin in private which is why Gavin made that post when in reality he should have waited for Craig to post it, or made clear the specifics of what happened without saying that he is confident that Craig is Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:09:33
Craig has a reputation for being a scammer and con artist. The type of person who can talk people in circles and convince them of shit they normally would never agree with. That, combined with a well faked private demonstration...well I could see that working on most people. Smart and intelligent people get scammed by these types of schemes in real life all the time. I think Gavin was hoodwinked and bought it (Craig obviously put a lot of time and effort into this) and has a hard time admitting it, and is holding out a bit of hope that Craig still may actually be SN.
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:02:46
I want him to sign a message with all of those. But it appears he doesn't actually have the keys and it seems logical that he might eventually try to give an excuse for why he can't sign a message with any of those keys. Except he has already shown Gavin and the world that he has the private key for block 1 via his demonstration to Gavin. So he can't talk his way out of proving that he has the private key to block 1. 
He either has that key in his possession now, or the demonstration provided to Gavin was fraudulent.
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:03:09
Of course they are. Craig (Satoshi) has a long record of acting like that.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:02:54
Why is it Satoshi's responsibility to personally risk his anonymity to disprove every person who claims to be him? Especially when those people claiming to be him could very easily prove it if they were.
If someone can't even pass the bar of verifying possession of those original private keys, Satoshi has no fucking reason to bother with anything.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:57:00
Using those key(s) to sign a message is pretty much the gold standard of proof. It's not a 100% certainty, but there is no other type of proof that comes anywhere close to it. He has supposedly proven to Gavin that he owns the private key to block 1. Either that private demonstration was fraudulent, or he has that key and can sign messages with it. He is crying like a little baby here as if he is the victim and that we should also feel bad for how we have treated Gavin and the others who backed Craig's claim. But if Craig feels bad for Gavin, maybe he should show us the exact same proof he showed Gavin.
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:54:35
And he already had his attempt to prove he is Satoshi 6 months ago debunked as fraudulent. I don't know why he would want to go through all of this again. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 21:42:45
Even if the keys were compromised, Satoshi would almost certainly still have them. It would just mean that someone else also has them. 
Cryptographic proof in the form of proving his possession of those private keys is the first step to take, and the most important piece of proof that is needed. If SN comes out and signs messages with those keys to prove his identity, you can bet your ass people will be looking at anything and everything to make sure it's him. But until that evidence comes along, no one is proving they are SN.
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:00:55
And how would it flush Satoshi out into the open? The guy can't prove dick. He got some media outlets to post articles about it because they like getting hits. 
If that was the purpose of this ruse, then it failed horribly.
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:13:59
I agree that Satoshi probably wants anonymity, but I don't think the kidnapping/extortion/etc.. shit holds much weight. There are plenty of bitcoin millionares. There are plenty of non-bitcoin millionares and billionares. Satoshi has the money to protect himself from this stuff. 
Ultimately I think Satoshi himself prefers to be anonymous as part of his own personal identity. The fact that he built something like bitcoin speaks wonders about how he feels about anonymity and avoiding government oversight and control. But I think plenty of people would think differently, myself included. I'd want to spend that money and enjoy life rather than hide myself away from it all.
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:03:05
And I think he is just a scammer who needs to try and prove to the people he is scamming that he is SN, and now that it's gotten so much attention and his proof has been entirely debunked he is playing the "leave me alone!!!1!!!1" card.
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:38:57
You mean the opinion of the same Gavin who has admitted he may have been hoodwinked by Craig? You mean the opinion of Gavin which is based on a proof shown in private, which was only done in private because Craig said he didn't want it to leak before the official announcement, and now that he has officially announced it he won't provide that proof to the public?
Yeah, I won't say the chance is zero. But if Craig is Satoshi, he can release the public proof. I mean he already proved it to Gavin by signing the message. He obviously has the key then right? So it should take him all of 5 minutes to sign a message that says "I, Craig Wright, am Satoshi." Boom done. And then I'll just wonder why Satoshi decided to prove his identity in such a cluster-fucked method instead of a blog post with a signed message that everyone in the community can verify.
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:13:57


What about his current approach is more safe than just posting the actual proof? I mean his goal here is to prove that he is SN in the first place. He is already deciding to forgo the safety of anonymity by going to media outlets and convincing Gavin to publicly verify his identity. So assuming his goal is to prove he is SN, how is it more safe to provide a bunch of evidence that doesn't prove anything rather than providing the one bit of evidence that does prove it?
EDIT: forgot to answer your first question:
“It’s certainly possible I was bamboozled,” Andresen says. “I could spin stories of how they hacked the hotel Wi-fi so that the insecure connection gave us a bad version of the software. But that just seems incredibly unlikely. It seems the simpler explanation is that this person is Satoshi.”

He has been planning the announcement for at least a month. He was certainly willing and able to travel to London, meet with Gavin, and prove possession of the private key to Gavin right then and there. I would think that one of the parts of his month+ long plan to announce his identity, which involved several news outlets, paying travel expenses for Gavin to meet him, and having people sign NDAs would also include releasing a prepared message signed with the private key to block 1.
Serious question, are people astroturfing for Craig? I am getting more and more convinced as people here use the stupidest reasoning and make logic-deficient arguments in his defense.

There are a lot of people here who are extremely anti-government and anti-authority. It's pretty clear why bitcoin draws them in. Unfortunately, they tend to extend that viewpoint to everyone else, assuming that everyone else should or does share their opinion. 
Personally I want to see bitcoin continue to grow and grow. For that to happen, we absolutely need legally compliant businesses focused around bitcoin such as coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 21:03:51
Why do you assume it is a black and white issue? I like being able to own, send, and receive bitcoins without reliance on a third party who could go bankrupt, or could just fuck something up and cause delays, or who the government has influence over, etc...
I also like the value added services that these third party companies can provide. I like having an online exchange where I can easily sell/buy bitcoins. I like having an online wallet service so I don't have to manage my own keys or bother with my own bitcoin program. I like fraud protection such as escrow (though I believe this functionality is built into the protocol now). I like that companies are working to find new ways to advance bitcoin, or to add value to the usage of bitcoin.
There are benefits of owning your own bitcoins, and there are benefits of using third party services. And I definitely want to see the core bitcoin protocol grow and advance while at the same time I want to see third party companies providing bitcoin services do the same.

Coinbase is a huge target. A single user is not unless they are one of the few people with a shit-ton of coins.
I cannot trust any online service to hold a significant amount of bitcoins unless the bitcoins I have with them are fully insured by an independent entity, and that insurance must be able to be verified by any individual that want to.
Don't get me wrong, Coinbase is one of the best out there, but I would rather trust myself with my coins. Then again, I probably have a much better understanding of computer security than most people since I work in the field.

If we get near that point there will have to be an update to the Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2016-07-21 17:28:07
Coinbase wouldn't be able to exist and operate if they ignored the law. I'll say what everyone else says, if you truly want to own your own bitcoins, you must be the only one who controls the private keys. A large online payment service like Coinbase is subject to many different laws and regulations of the government, similar to paypal. And when they get a subpoena in, well they can either turn over the info or be held in contempt of court and get fucked by the law.
Don't deal with coinbase if you don't want these types of things to happen. The beauty of bitcoin is that there isn't an inherent need to use a service like coinbase to send or receive money. But if you are going to use them for the additional value their service adds, you need to accept that they are subject to the law.

So yeah, if someone comes out and claims to be Satoshi and is able to con some influential people including Gavin into believing him, it's gonna get some major coverage.

In your example, you just experienced $8k in capital gains. There are different rules for taxation based on how long you held the BTC for. If you held it for less than a year, it is a short term capital gain. If you held it for more than a year, it is a long term capital gain. Those are taxed at different rates.
Short term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, which means it is basically added to your income for the year when you pay taxes to the IRS. If you make a lot of money, that could be up in the 30% taxation rate. If you don't make a lot of money, that could be down in the teens.
For long term capital gains, the tax rate is 15%, unless you make more than $200k, where a 3.8% medicare tax kicks in, and if you make over $400k, it jumps to 20% plus that 3.8%.
So basically, if you held them for less than a year, the $8k is treated like income. If you held for more than a year, the $8k will probably be taxed at 15%.

The thing is that a service can be built on top of bitcoin to do that, like visa does with the US dollar.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:42:18
I would recommend that a novice user use such a service as well, but I would also recommend that a novice user educate himself quickly on wallets and how to protect yourself, and then move your funds to your own wallet.
I keep money in a bank because a bank is FDIC insured, and electronic fraud is easily reversed. With BTC, major online wallet services do not have that deposit insurance and BTC transactions cannot be reversed. Once it is sent, the BTC is gone and you can't get it back by reversing the transaction or anything like that.
I would be willing to hold significant BTC with coinbase if they had insurance similar to FDIC deposit insurance. Until they do, I will continue to use them for everything but storing my main BTC funds.
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:36:32
Coinbase holds your BTC like a bank would hold your money. If you want to transfer your coinbase BTC to your own wallet, you need to transfer money to an address you have in your wallet.

Dictionary attacks on passwords are only really effective against people with extremely common passwords (e.g. password123) or if you are able to get a copy of the password database for the site.

Oh, you are certainly very right about the current set of bitcoin payment processing companies. They have a very long way to go large companies would have the trust to work with them. I suppose I was simply trying to point out that accepting bitcoin directly from customers is something that businesses will not be doing except in rare cases. Eventually either a large existing company like VISA might get in the game, or maybe one of the smaller companies around now might grow into something large and reputable enough. Time will tell on that one.

I don't think you understand how retirement savings work. You invest the money. If you withdraw 3% a year, you will likely not lose any principal over the course of 50 years, and that even accounts for inflation. 3% a year would be $24750. An individual could retire on that if they lived frugally, which this lady probably already does as a Walmart employee.

You would have made 3 purchases of Bitcoins with 3 different cost basis'. When you sell/convert to whatever the IRS by default assumes first in, first out. They consider it you cashing out the first bitcoin you bought, then .8 of the second bitcoin you bought. You can also specifically notate which you are selling at the time that you sell them. Your specific notation of which you are selling then overrides the default assumption of FIFO.

And yes, every investment has risk and has no guarantee. Even federally issues bonds...I mean the government could go bankrupt? The risk is incredibly low but it is still there.
So you can critique me for using past performance as an indicator of what you could get, and I will critique you back when you suggest an investment of your own.
It is about levels of risk. If you properly invest for retirement, you should be able to somewhat safely withdraw 3% a year without chipping away at the principle. Yes, you might have to adjust in a big down year, but welcome to life.

I think the point is that validating a paper wallet still requires a computing device with internet access.

I honestly kind of understand where Apple is coming from. With Bitcoin, you have the potential to store a private key with millions of dollars worth of bitcoin on your phone. What happens if Apple has a bug that somehow allows a hacker to access that private key? Boom, millions of dollars stolen because of a bug on a phone operating system. They don't want the liability.
Sure, it's a cop out, but I understand why they are avoiding the issue by not letting people store wallets directly on their phone.

They aren't blaming it on bitcoin. In many ways the ease with which bitcoins can be lost is a huge negative point. Sure, it is a tradeoff from not being able to reverse transactions, but it kinda sucks. People like knowing that they don't have to worry about fraud...that they can just report it and someone will take care of it and they will get their money back.
Hopefully some services will be built on top of bitcoin that provide that kind of functionality.

Transaction fees
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:55:21
I'm pretty sure most companies that start accepting bitcoin will do so through payment processing companies like bitpay or coinbase. The payment processing companies guarantee the payment and decide what risks are acceptable to take.
These payment processing companies can do things to lower the risk like escrow, customer verification, and setting policies as to how big of a purchase requires how many confirmations. If i was an owner of a company that wasn't tech based, I would rather pay a 1% fee to a company like coinbase or bitpay than worry about the risk of all that stuff myself.
Think about how most purchases work currently. They go through debit cards and credit cards which charge similar, but typically higher fees. As long as the company complies with the merchant agreement which regards to how they accept card based purchases, they are pretty much indemnified from the costs of fraud and the card company eats that cost.

The problem with lost coins has nothing to do with the fact that they will never be usable again. It has to do with how easy it is for an individual to lose a large amount of coins by losing a single private key. That presents a usability issue to individuals, which can be solved by true bitcoin banking services that hold your bitcoin for you and are fully insured and everything.
Bitcoins are divisible to the 8th decimal, and that can be expanded if needed. Losing coins does not detrimentally affect the network as a whole, but rather just the individual who lost the coins.

Adding to that, the nature of the open ledger with Bitcoin makes it very hard to fully hide where the money came from. There is no true record created when someone hands you 10 dollars for some service. With Bitcoin, if someone sends you 10 dollars worth, that transaction is recorded in the blockchain permanently and there really isn't a good way around that.

Eh, I think $.25 is a bit too much. $.04 that some clients are using now isn't bad though.

There is currently no dynamic system to change keep transaction fees reasonable as the value of BTC changes.

1. Email predates the smartphone and if any company releases a smartphone that does not do email, it won't sell. That may be the case several years in the future with Bitcoin, but it is not the case now.
2. It's email. If your email get's hacked, the hackers can read your email. If your bitcoin wallet gets hacked, the hacker can permanently steal every bitcoin you have and there is no way to ever get them back.
You are comparing two very different things. I'm playing devils advocate here. Bitcoin is a relatively unknown item with very serious security concerns and financial issues. I would be willing to bet you that a year from now, Apple will not block bitcoin wallet apps by default. Give them some time to figure it out and to figure out how they want to handle bitcoin moving forward.
Or they might release their own iCoin for all I know. I'm just trying to use some logic and reason to come up with legitimate reasons why Apple might be doing what it is doing.

Realistically, it needs to be a big company that knows technology and can properly implement a bitcoin payment system. That means a big company that regularly takes a lot of payments and probably operates in the online space. That type of company would have the knowledge to implement a bitcoin payment system and would have a customer base with a higher percentage of bitcoin owners that most other companies.
Valve, Newegg, Amazon, etc... are good examples of companies that would benefit the bitcoin economy the most if they were to adopt it now.

Eh, to me that is an emotionally driven decision. OP needs to objectively look at his options and decide which he wants to do.
He needs to ask himself "If I had $45k in extra cash right now but no bitcoins, would I invest it all in BTC." If that answer is yes, keep it all in BTC. If no, then don't. (The $45k number is the cash he would have after taxes)
Too many people make emotional decisions. Some people here are saying that he should keep it in BTC because if he loses it all, he will only be out $50, but in reality he will be out $45k, which is the amount of cash he would have if he sold it right now. Then some people say "sell some so you don't feel bad if it crashes to zero." THESE ARE BOTH EMOTIONALLY DRIVEN DECISIONS.
