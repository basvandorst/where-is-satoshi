Maybe my transfer will be done by the time I’m through these videos :/.... at least it’ easier to hodl while waiting for the transfer.

Lmao I’m imagining in my head a scenario in a 3rd world country where word gets out that there’s someone who will take their fiat in exchange for btc. I bet there were no shortages of folks willing to trade! So sad that such few exchanges are working with third world fiat, glad you were able to bring some in!

So I agree with ya... But it seems like there has to be more to it than this. Never mined before, so I'm just a newbie with a little cash to spend.

Well I thought about that, but I doubt it's going to double my investment in a year... Could be wrong, but right now the Antminer S9 can do that according to the analysis.

Bingo. That's what I missed. Thanks dude!

So I disagree with the first part, but yes on the second.
Our (USA) and most governments don’t “tax us via inflation” to paraphrase your point. In fact most governments have 0 control over their currency. The currency circulation and management thereof is completely up to the Fed. Now Congress can authorize the Fed to do something, but really that’s a formality as the Fed can do it without Congressional authorization (although a part of me believes they do this to circumvent the inevitable Constitutional challenges they would face otherwise). So when the Fed prints more money it isn’t to put into politicians pockets, but instead it’s used to enable banks to make free money off giving out loans. And what backs all of this? The US taxpayer via Treasury Securities.

Btc does what the treasury/fed should do, but you need to look into the great crime of ‘73. Deflation and commodity based currency ensures that the economy will never grow past the artificial limitation of the commodity. And it ALWAYS ensures that the rich get richer.

“As long as technology keeps advancing, then we are able to produce more units of (most) commodities per person hour of labor.
So if you measure prices in average person hours of labor over time, you would expect the price of most commodities to fall.”
1. This is speculative and while it sounds right, it isn’t because:
1a. Commodity costs are correlated to, but not completely determined by labor costs.
2. You’re not factoring the increase in the costs of the technology you’re mentioning. 
3. Correlated to technology increase we see expiration dates on current commodities. For example, we can produce horses at a 1000-fold rate than we could in 1850. And relatively cheaper as well I’m sure... But thanks to the same technology that you’re speaking of (cars/automated agricultural innovations/etc.) we no longer need horses in that same capacity. Same goes for kerosene, coal engines, etc.

I really don’t want to come across the wrong way or take things to a personal level, but you’re categorically incorrect. Deflation is not a consequence of a growing economy. It’s typically a consequence of either over-production or currency mismanagement. 
Again, if you’ll look at the history I referenced above you’ll see that deflation via currency de-circulation was catastrophic to the American people. This is the entire basis for the Wizard of Oz children’s tale. In the book, Dorothy’s slippers are made of silver. The great and promising technicolor world that was promised by bankers if we adopted the gold standard (yellow brick road) was a farce. 
This decimated our economy, reduced the circulation of currency by 80% and completely placed power and money control in the hands of the wealthy few. Now there’s a lot to discuss regarding the reason why deflation has a negative effect on an economy, but there is a direct correlation between commodity based currencies and deflation. 
This is something that was a primary cause of the American Revolution according to Franklin and it is theorized that JC’s minting of gold coins and bringing gold into circulation was the primary reason for the downfall of Rome.

I know it’s not the point of OP, but a lot of people are talking about how currency should be backed by gold... which is hilarious since that is the exact opposite stance that BTC fans should have. If anything, BTC should be a great example of why a backing isn’t necessary. Anyone who believes in using the gold standard should watch this documentary:
