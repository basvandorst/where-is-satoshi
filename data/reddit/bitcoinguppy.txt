That's true in some cases, but if you want to trade using more than a single exchange pricing data you utilize a provider who supports multiple and an aggregated index...  they sell their data to trading shops, quants.... and bot platforms.  [

Cryptocompare tweeted that it has fixed the issue.... if you go to their site everything looks kosher now but I asked them if the issue would have been included in their API feeds and hence ingested by traders/bots or if it was local to their website only.  They've stated before that they use the same API for both, so I don't see how both wouldn't have been impacted.   
I screenshoted the issue over the past few hours to record, charts are now all updated to appear properly.

It looks like that is correct, but I wouldn't be too quick to blindly believe everything cryptocompare states on this issue. Remember when coinmarketcap dropped Korean exchange data and the market dumped? They didn't rush to admit they cause the issue either, but it was their screw up that created the drop. It's still worth some critical analysis if anyone subscribes to their data feeds...

They brag that they 'eat their own dog food' meaning the same data feed they sell to trading shops and bot developers is used to provide the data and charts on their site...  They've now confirmed via their twitter feed the issue exists and they are working to fix it.  This isn't a small deal, especially on a Sunday with typical low volumes. One trading shop or bot with say 100 BTC using their data feed will react, creating the next... and all of the other bots that do use single-exchange api's will start to react to those sell orders...it's the downside to automated trading.

Actually, the time period of the issue still shows zero volume and price change during the outage...

The worlds second largest crypto price and data site crashes the same minute BTC drops 5% and I thought it was worth some thought... still do.

And here's an update... [

That's in interesting theory. Do you have any, or know of any analysis to support it?  Not saying it's wrong just wonder if someone's proven it.  Most ICO's were done in ETH so if there were mass dumps of ETH for BTC I would expect that ETH price would have fallen during the run up and it didn't.  Also ICO's were still very active in Q1-Q2 2018 and Bitcoin price was dropping rapidly but people still thought it would rebound. So why not sell ETH for BTC then and shouldn't we have therefore seen BTC price increase?

I'm 100% with you !!!  If bitcoin drops to 2k I'll post your trezor recovery seed with 44 BTC as well.

I see a few valid points but also a few weak arguments here..
1. The lead up to the launch of CME / CBOE futures is widely considered one of the catalyst for the 2017 Q4 run up in BTC price.  You can't consider the drop post launch without also considering the rise pre launch of futures...Would we have ever seen $20k without the 'rumors' of futures launching?  Probably not. What price though we will never know.
2. Prior to Dec 2017 there were very few (if any) ways for US investors to bet against BTC period.... As US citizens we can't open accounts on most of the exchanges that provide options to short. So you need to consider if that was also artificially inflating prices and had even BTC backed (not cash settled) options been introduced would we have still seen the drop or a large percentage of it.  Note this could still have been the 'traditional systems' attack on BTC as much as your theory its just not the printed BTC theory.
3. Lot's of people suggested that when future are introduced the price of the underlying commodity/asset drops. There have been some great analysis done with gold... This would suggest it's not really a conspiracy to attack BTC but rather just how the market works when vehicles to bet against something is more widely available.  
For the record.  My own conspiracy theory is that big pocket traders are manipulating the market using all available options and that includes (requires) futures and options.  I also think the BCash cartel does the same thing, they very likely shorted the broad crypto market prior to Dr Craig Wright (BCH SV) publicly tweeting he would sell 'a lot of btc and bring the price back to $1000".   He did this on Nov 14, 8:54 am and within 60 minutes we lost $400 and started the latest drop of 40%.  Did he create the entire drop, no but he was the catalyst to accelerate the bear sentiment that is in place .  That's typically considered illegal market manipulation

It's like asking, "If a better internet came out would you be open to switching...?" How would it be better? Why wouldn't the existing system simply adopt the new tech after it proves out? How do you get everyone  to move off whats proven and works and onto something new....?
