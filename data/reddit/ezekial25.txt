Very nice great review! 
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:18:40
Don't accept it.

Ridiculous 
@_date: 2015-12-06 18:22:41
Wow! Who Cares...... Politicians and Banksters can take the highway 
@_date: 2016-06-08 23:40:52
So why is there Cointelegraph posts on the front page? If Reddit universally banned CT posts why are they still on Reddit, posted just hours ago?? :/
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:45:06
They are too high. It's gotten beyond ridiculous in just a few months. But no one wants to hear it.

@_date: 2016-07-15 12:24:51
What a bunch of fools these OneCoiners are. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 13:44:34
No seems like they are gonna distribute it 
@_date: 2016-07-27 13:44:02
This doesn't work

This is beyond ridiculous. Making changes to a document you have no say in. Geesh. People have a lot of nerve. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 14:11:35
Excellent post. FYI the writer IS someone living in Japan. :)
