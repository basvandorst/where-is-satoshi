I misunderstood your comment.  If the sole currency of the world is Bitcoin then you are correct, but if Bitcoin is equatable to the dollar then the price is fixed. One gumball will still cost .25c no matter the price of Bitcoin it will just require less of a Bitcoin to own.
But I don't mean infinite growth more like price equilibrium one where speculation meets real world demand. No one knows what that number will be or if Bitcoin will ever achieve it, but if it does that number should stay more or less consistent over a long period of time.
Only then can Bitcoin be practically used as an actual currency.

You clearly have no idea about supply and demand.
People who held Amazon stock since 1999 have generated value out of thin air too so what's your point?

It originally said student debt or something of that nature.
It was also originally funny.
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:24:38
"Creates value out of thin air" oh ya mean something like hmm I don't know... currency everyone in the world?
Not to mention it actually doesn't because it takes equipment and electricity to generate Bitcoin.
Also the supply is fixed unlike currency.
What a stupid argument lol.

A death cross is when the long term moving average crosses over the short term moving average which signals a high sell volume and no upwards momentum aka bear market.
He did not mean the insignia of the Germans in WW1.
But God damn it that is funny.

Bitcoin can be divided down to 1 SAT and there is no penalty for buying a smaller amount of bitcoin.
Therefore it can be traded with the same efficiency at 1 million or 1 dollar. 
So why do you care about the price of Bitcoin? If you're a an average person who wishes to use BTC instead of a credit card you don't care. 
The problem is there is no real benefit to using Bitcoin over a credit card , not accepted everywhere, slow,higher fees, not as easily accessible or reloadable and perhaps the biggest drawback a highly volatile price.
The difference is there is technically no limit on the amount of dollars in circulation ( now 13 trillion ) but a hard unchangeable limit on the amount of bitcoin that can ever exist.
People are hoping that this and real world adoption causes a price increase that gives way to a stable Bitcoin highly useable Bitcoin, one with constantly increasing value and that their 1 Bitcoin will be worth a lot more in the future.
If it wasn't for that speculation, as of now, Bitcoin would be almost entirely worthless.

He bought REQ.  $1 to 3 cents.

Yea it might not but there's a real possibility that is also might not
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:38:17
I agree with you although crypto moves at a much faster pace then previous markets.  I think we will continue to move sideways until more adoption comes along or real life use cases other than another means of currency come to light.

Listen storage devices get corrupted, lost, hacked, etc.
I store about 150k on Binance the rest on my ledger. I like the liquidity if being able to use it at any time, and if Binance goes down my coins going to be worthless anyways.
And by 150k I mean 150,000 REQ coins so about 3.50 usd LOL. Gottem.
REQ network is the future of commerce guys don't forget.

Ya you say this but Bitcoin could be pagers,VCRs, tape players, CD players,etc as well.
But nice pick and choose narrative.

He wasn't climbing a mountain he was building one. For 10 years he carefully put block on top of block. 
Then one day a bunch of new people came in gave him a near endless supply of blocks and told him they wanted a huge mountain and they wanted it yesterday.
He worked tirelessly to build it but it grew too big too fast and without a solid foundation it was doomed to fail. Investors wanted their blocks back and his mountain came crashing down.
He's doing fine now he's still working on that mountain thinking of new ways to make it sturdier. He blames himself for what happened but it wasn't his fault he was only doing what he was told.

This guy gets it

Not really, if you think about it 120k Bitcoin would roughly have a market cap of 2 trillion.
Is it that hard to believe that a fundamentally secure global currency that has a limited supply and no more than half it's supply in circulation at any time can be worth 120k per one?
Gold has a market cap of 7 trillion and is no where as liquid as Bitcoin especially if Bitcoin can find a use other than a store of value.
The future is uncertain but it sure is exciting.

What is the point though you don't know shit about the future of this technology but you act as if you are a prophet. What facts are you presenting?
This technology is still in it's infancy and literally a billion different scenarios can play out by the end of this year including the single one you have presented.
Your public service is meaningless because you are technically a nobody rambling on Reddit. You have no more insight into this matter than any of us.
Just let it be. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:14:21
Lol if you think I would listen to anything said on reddits public discussion regarding crypto.
Put your money where your mouth is if by the end of the year Bitcoin is 3k I will give you 1 Bitcoin otherwise you give me the difference between bitcoins price and your prediction. 
Otherwise stop posting.

Cuz he's full of shit like the 99% of others who claim to know what's going on.

Bitmain is cancer. 
Bitmain developed ASIC miners and used them to mine Bitcoin in turn increasing the hash rate. To be competitive in mining BTC you basically needed a bitmain miner as they had a huge Monopoly and first mover advantage.
Bitmain knew this so they would release their miners at the tail end of their usefulness. People bought up these miners that were never intended to ROI as bitmain quickly began mining with their more powerful miners.
Rinse and repeat. Today an A9 antminer is worth 300 down from 5,000 at the beginning of the year. 
Bitmain took advantage of a lot of people I guess you could argue they just played the market well and took advantage of people's fear of missing out.
But they knew what they were doing.
