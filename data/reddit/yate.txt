The idea is you don't have to open a channel directly with the person. They will have open channels with other nodes in the network and you will have open channels with other nodes in the network. There will likely be a path between you and this person that you can use to transact.
    You (.4) -----A----- (.6) Starbucks (.7) -----B----- (.3) Seller
Starbucks is just an example here, there could be 2+ nodes in between you and the seller, but say you are both connected through your local Starbucks. When you pay the seller .1 BTC for some item, the channels will be updated to
    You (.3) -----A----- (.7) Starbucks (.6) -----B----- (.4) Seller
There is no need to open or close any channels, unless you want to move your bitcoins to cold storage.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:12:05


Yes, each time you send bitcoin to an address, electrum will automatically generate a new one you can use next time (helps with anonymity). The addresses on the phone and on tails will always match.


Not exactly.  There is no need to send from your Android wallet to your tails wallet. They both access the same funds. The only difference is that the tails wallet has the private keys to spend those funds. 
So when you go to the ATM and send bitcoin to an address on your phone, the next time you open your tails wallet you will see that same transaction.

Luke-jr is against a block size increase currently (he has submitted BIPs increasing it at a later date) but he recognizes his view is the minority, so he supports the generation of segwit addresses by default.

You might want to just double check the address on your receive tab in android matches the address on the receive tab in tails. If it does then you are good to go.

There is a better way to do this and that is to create a watch only wallet. You can download electrum on android and import the master public key.  This will allow you to generate addresses for your tails wallet without storing the private keys on your phone.

More likely lightning is going to be layer 3, we'll see a second layer in between that handles channel rebalancing which will reduce the need to keep opening and closing channels on a blockchain 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:22:30
The channels would look this.
    Alice (2.5) -----A----- (2.5) Bob (.1) -----B----- (.1) Eve
Alice sends .1 BTC to Eve
    Alice (2.4) -----A----- (2.6) Bob (0) -----B----- (.2) Eve
Now channel B from Bob to Eve is depleted, so Alice won't be able to send funds to Eve using that channel. The network will either need to find a different route, or open a new channel between Alice and Eve.

You should scan the master public key of your tails wallet (Wallet -&gt; Information),  This will allow you to continue to generate new addresses on your phone.
On android, create a standard wallet -&gt; Use public or private keys -&gt; Scan the QR code of the master public key.

The price of bitcoin goes up and down,  your $100 worth of bitcoin might be worth $130 or $70 depending on the time of day.

This is just wrong. The transaction will either get confirmed or they will be dropped from the mempool at some point and you can resend your transaction.

Also with 2.8, replace by fee is on by default if it detects a transaction is sent with a low fee.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:52:01
It wouldn't happen more slowly either.  Even with bigger blocks we don't have the kind of scalability for a global currency, don't have instant transactions, or cross chain swaps. Plus there are other layers that are going to built on top of lightning.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:07:46
I'm assuming you'll need to update. I'm not sure on the implementation details. It could automatically start using segwit addresses, or maybe there will be some sort of toggle to switch back and forth.

@_date: 2017-08-22 15:25:20
There's nothing you need to do. Eventually Electrum will be updated and you will be able to generate segwit addresses and receive segwit transactions in order to get the benefits. Regular transactions will continue to work as they did before.

That assumes you don't get your money streamed to you daily/hourly over the lightning network itself.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:09:53
That's not true, 2MB blocks will fill up quickly, and the lightning network requires larger blocks to function properly with a large user base. Lightning development will continue regardless of block size.

Well you were just asking what the incentive was, not necessarily monetary. Then you stated that there was no monetary incentive.
You only pay miners because the cost of mining is exponentially more than running a node. You're right that there is really no point of running a full node unless you are an enthusiast and care about verifying your transactions. Much like seeding a torrent provides no value to you, but you are helping the network.

All I'm saying is that there are incentives to run a node. If you're Coinbase or another business, you're going to run your own node so that you aren't dependent on anyone else to accept and send transactions. There may not be any value for you personally but there is value for others.

I use Electrum, it doesn't let you set a specific fee, but it has a fee slider you can use. Mycelium is also recommended and allows you to set custom fees.

If you want to start completely from scratch and remove your wallets, you can delete the .electrum directory  in your home directory.

Otherwise, you should be able to just create a new wallet. File &gt; New/Restore.

The current economical fee is [151 sat/byte]( If your transaction is a standard 226 bytes that means you'd be paying $1.29. This is assuming you want your transaction confirmed in 2 blocks. If your transaction didn't need to be immediate, you could have paid 6 sat/byte fees, or $0.05 for your transaction for confirm in 6 blocks. Basically use a wallet that estimates fees well, and allows you to set a custom fee if your transaction doesn't need to be immediate.

I recommend following this guide.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:43:58
No, in order to receive funds in lightning you need a channel already open, which requires an on-chain transaction.  Here are a couple of scenarios that might happen.
You have a lightning wallet with zero balance. When you buy bitcoin from an exchange, they open a channel with you using an on-chain transaction
    You (.5) -----A----- Exchange (0)
In this case the exchange creates channel with the full .5 BTC on your side. At this point you would no longer be able to receive funds. You only have one channel open and all the funds are on your side. In order to buy more from the exchange using lightning, another on-chain transaction must occur, which would open a new channel.
Another scenario would be after a couple days you buy something from Amazon, costing .2 BTC. You don't have a channel open directly with Amazon, but Amazon happens to have a channel open with your exchange. So you can send .2 BTC to Amazon using lightning.
Before your transaction
    You (.5) -----A----- (0) Exchange (6) -----B----- Amazon (8)
After your transaction
    You (.3) -----A----- (.2) Exchange (5.8) -----B----- Amazon (8.2)
Now if you want to buy .2 BTC from your exchange, you can use the lightning network directly, with no on-chain transaction. The channel simply updates the balance
    You (.5) -----A----- (0) Exchange (5.8) -----B----- Amazon (8.2)
This is assuming all nodes behave. If they try to cheat you, that would require an on-chain transaction
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:26:19
I've read that in the future they expect people to open maybe 2 channels per year.  How will those channels be funded after they're created?  Say someone opens a channel with 3 BTC and mines .001 BTC. How can they add those funds to the open channel, or do they need to open a new channel and send those coins through lightning?
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:40:28
Are you using the latest version of electrum? My default settings set the fee at 198 sat/B (to be included in the next 5 blocks), as opposed to your 50 sat/B.  Have you changed the fee settings at all? In addition, the latest version of electrum should have turn on replace-by-fee if the fee was too low.

The money should be sent back your account, minus whatever fee you had to pay to initiate the wire transfer.  You can contact your bank so they know the transaction was invalid.
