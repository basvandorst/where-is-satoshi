how can everyone rebuy if they lost "all" their money on coinbase.
Interresting thing for the signing key.
So even if he could, can the money be take back from him ? or kind of blacklisted/impossible to withdraw like the tether hacker ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:59:40
buying/Selling may be fine but i feel like &gt;75% of buyer keeps their coins on exchange.
What if 12 millions customers lost a total of 1 million bitcoin over the night, fully burnt ?
