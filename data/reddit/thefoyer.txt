As a developer with something recently greenlit, I got an email about this. I would be happy to accept bitcoin!

I ordered mine within like the first 8 minutes of them going on presale and mine still hasn't even shipped :|

I would just like to say, that's because fiat is what I can pay my taxes in or go buy a car or groceries. I've purchased many things online with bitcoin and if it was more available then it wouldn't be necessary to switch into "fiat" and then the "value" of bitcoin would  probably be more than we could imagine.

Probably not the appropriate time or thread but damn I felt bad for the 3 I sold early.

I can already see my friends and family's eyes glass over as I'm half way through the sentence.

It gets easier the longer you hodl. I don't even think about it anymore
@_date: 2014-12-04 19:22:04
If that were the case than that's even more reason to to find another bank..
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:01:16
You'd be better off exchanging that for btc
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:07:11


Sadly, a lot of software companies are like that. And it's not always incompetence on the tech side. People signing the paychecks make the final decisions.

They do! GPUs!

Are you forgetting that servers and browsers store this kinda stuff in logs??
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:13:45


Was it questioned it wouldn't? Nobody brought up "quality of racing" just you. It doesn't hurt or help. F1 is a completely different ball game.
But using technology that is relevant to today's technology with automobiles. It only helps. Allowing more innovation to the cars does not take it to F1 level. There are still specs teams have to follow. Indycar is the same way and it's nothing like F1 but it's still way more innovative... To eli5

Wow, I dont even know what to say.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:43:14
I find this to be true with all things that become popular and "mainstream"
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:19:27
This is why I actually purchased a fireproof box for holding my crypto's, but that's not the only place they are stored either.
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:56:35
Holy shit look at that place. WTF did they think was going to happen? Dumbasses...
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:45:32
But if we don't spend it what's the point? Since I've been doing this I've spent 3btc and I have no regrets. It doesn't seem right to me if everyone just buys and holds. Eventually something is going to pop.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:03:22
I do agree but we don't even know what kind of technological improvements we're even talking about here. We're just speculating. Did moving from carb to fuel inj affect the quality of racing? Doubt it. I would consider myself an "innovative technology" person and I don't watch nascar. For me the quality of racing and "driver" skill isn't even there to begin with regardless of the innovation (innovation would help). But that's my personal opinion and why I watch other forms of motorsport.

"Cowboy miner" explains it all

It's not good practice, why are we arguing this? As a web developer you should be minimizing potential security holes as much as possible. To your fullest extent. It's no excuse.


You can't assume everyone is saving their password through their browser. I don't. I use a password manager. Do I trust chrome with my passwords? F*k no.


Oh that makes me feel better. /s And, personally, no there isn't. Not bigger problems for me. For the sysadmin maybe.. But not the customer who just had his account compromised.
Just saying. It takes minutes to fix an "issue" like this. It's good practice. There is no reason to have the password in plain text in the URL. SSL or not.

@_date: 2017-11-25 16:33:47
Because some people actually like driving farther than 200 miles at a time before they have to plug their car in for an hour. Gas station is a 5 minute stop at best.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:31:02
Because people have different tastes and opinions then you. Shocking I know....
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:31:34
The driver and a lot of subscribers on this sub probably have a lot in common though.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:07:58
You're an idiot
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:16:58


Hardly. It's not worth it over $600.
This is more of a cash analogy I don't think the Bank is going to replace your stolen cash.
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:20:03
With this attitude it'll never get anywhere. So I'm happy to spend it, that's what's it for. You want that to continue to be worth something don't ya?
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:22:25
Sounds like to me selling on the SR by default makes you guilty. Doesn't matter if you pay taxes on it at that point. Unregulated criminal enterprise.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:41:25
I don't know for sure personally/technically but from some of the threads I've read. The guy really didn't have it all together. I mean, he was being blackmailed by someone who had got access to the DB and he was posting questions on stack overflow about CURL and php over the onion, I can't find the post I'm referring too at the moment. But it seems like there was a bit of ignorance floating around his head.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:58:43
It definitely helped BTC but it's not behind the wheel anymore. Besides, now there is a huge gap to actually build a better more secure SR. So all will be back.

Cash will soon be the new bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:11:41
Too bad for you. Probably would've been quicker to implement litecoin into your website than writing up that essay.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:56:06
You're speculating, but I think it's cool these younger kids are interested in bitcoin. I think that's good for the future of bitcoin. Maybe these kids are ahead of their years; a bit more mature. At 14 the last thing I was interested in was money or investments. I think I was still playing with GI Joes. I say more power to them!
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:31:20


That does sound like me..

The number on the right.. I mean, .02 to 500? And it's all over the place. That really changes with the graph looks like.. Unless something is totally going over my head here, maybe my glasses aren't on?

How much ΔV is that?

You might be referring to the exploit that was used to bust that cp ring... yeah different incident. And it was fixed.

Sweet, I've been waiting so I can buy more
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:12:00
Ahh ok, I was missing that important piece of information about moving it *out* of the country! Thanks!

Google chrome spell check sucks, even when you tell it to search online for more suggestions.
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:55:18
Totally agree. My personal experience: I heard about BTC and SR a year or more ago. I thought it was very cool but even at $10 a coin I thought it was too much. SR peaked my interest in BTC but not enough to invest in it. I bought my first bitcoin when it was &gt;$100. So SR had no influence on my purchasing bitcoin and maybe that is a lot of other peoples experience too. What I'm trying to say is what I said before, SR helped BTC in the beginning but I believe BTC is on its own and isn't held up by SR anymore.
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:16:53
It wasn't till I read your comment and looked a bit more closely that I still thought they were $100
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:38:03


Really? Because when I first found out about SR and bitcoin it was $12 a coin and I thought that was too much. So that has nothing to do with why the price was high (IMO). Just goes to show what people know.
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:34:07
I found this rather.. well




This is what I read:


This guy is an "employee"?
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:29:01
Oh yeah? Well I bought 2 coins around the $90 mark (just a couple months ago) and just sold them both for $332! :p
I'm itching bad to buy more, not just 1 or 2.. I need to save a little capital
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:09:59
I was looking at it in January and I thought 12$ a BTC was high... FUCK ME, right?!
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:48:50
Could someone explain to me how the Chinese use bitcoin to get around their 50k transactions per year? They still have to buy the bitcoin with Yuan, so it would still show up as a transaction, no? Just trying to understand.
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:23:55


Who isn't? The demand is there, people want it; they'll find a way.
