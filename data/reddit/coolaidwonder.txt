Corruption everywhere its just to what degree.

Haha yeah i dont see what the point of this article is like he didnt prove his point at all. Waste of 5 minutes lol.

I wonder how many btc a day is lost due to people losing private keys and what not.
Also for plural bitcoin would you call it bitcoin's or something different?
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:03:36
Political insatability is definetly good for bitcoin more so then gold. Because when there is political instability chances of getting robbed go way up. I would agree with you overall though gold is a much safer bet.

Because people want an excuse when it goes down. Eaiser to believe something simple e.g manipulation then to realize there are a ton of things that affect the demand.
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:10:47
I thought amish people dont even use technology like the internet. Might be wrong though haha
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:01:12
I feel like people way overestimate market manipulation. There are some people trying to malipulate it up some trying to malipulate it down. Having futures just makes it a balanced market.

Now this symbol I can get behind all that elementry school practice paying off

I mean fraud is never good sucks for people that put some money on the exchange.
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:11:52
Thats an interesting take. Not sure what too make of microsoft buying github.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:52:56
Please give me all your usd then because it has no intrisic value and is only useful as a means of exchange. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:40:25
You can already pay taxes in bitcoin in some states if you want. The guy point makes no sense to me if people lose trust or value the dollar less then the purchasing power goes down same as bitcoin.

Works fine for me can you not log on?
@_date: 2019-02-09 18:41:44
And signature size continues to go down its not gonna be used to transfer money much if it is slow and expensive
@_date: 2019-02-12 02:10:31
There is a difference between privacy and secrecy. paying with cash at 7 eleven is a private transaction in a sense but not a secret transaction the cashier saw you.

Wait what is a hodl hoard

How many miners does matter because the tx well get cleared faster thus miners will get to the lower fees faster. Its a supply and demand for mining fees.

Is the ethos wallet safe to store btc i am worried that if the project closes my small amount of btc would be stuck? Also what is your site?
@_date: 2019-04-29 16:24:30
There are already bitcoin loans lol. You could eaisly make a credit card backed by bitcoin i totally agree with you.

What the stock market is speculating on if the price of the stock will go up
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:54:06
Say for example you have an idea say for example "amazon" but you dont have much money with no stock market or loans you couldnt make your idea "amazon" happen. 
The stock market attempts to give money to the best projects making it easier for more successful companies to grow.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:12:16
All investing is speculation to an extent. Do you think there is value in having a stock market?
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:21:24
All curreny is a zero sum game only 100% purchasesing power in the world to divide up. But in terms of goods you can grow the pie reducing transactional cost of money can allow you to trade in a more frictionless way. Which will allow good ideas to be implemented faster which grows the pie.

Maybe poker was a bad example im just saying almost everything is a bet in a sense certainly an index is also. Something that is more risky isnt nessarly a better or worse bet just depends on the risk vs the reward.
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:07:30
I just depends when you bought index funds are great as maybe 90% of a portfollio. If you have 4%  btc and rebalance every once and awhile you would have made much more money over most time intervals. Then just index funds.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:18:34
I would be good i think. Current system discourages saving and incourages being risky/ spending money. Many of the things we are spending money on are very wasteful and not very productive. Also government different from fed so government doesnt really control the money supply but they pay interest on the printed money they borrow.

Awesome book though we are talking about the nassim taleb one right? Sorry if i spelt the name wrong
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:36:17
and visa takes 3 % of every transaction from the merchants?
exchange fee for different currency 
does visa have employs that drive to work everyday?
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:32:48
And lots have been manipulating bitcoin upward too! But no one seems to care unless the price is going down
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:07:00
Haha same here beatiful hotel
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:30:22
I mean so is an index its just a safer bet. So is poker but you can consistantly make money doing that too if you are a good player.
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:55:44
fee is 22 cents for btc as of today. average cost is not 1% for visa lol. What about money transfer i would agree you wont buy coffee with btc. What about having un banked people be store and trade "money". 
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:38:04
Not for the retailers point of view. yes for you it appears there is no fee but the retailer just passes on the fee it is a hidden cost. Not to mention you pay once a year for your visa and most people end up having to pay some fees on overdo things.
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:32:33
There are places in the world with corrupt banks/ government. People can have money and be Unbanked.
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:15:46
Having a more efficent system grows the pie???
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:33:21
Kind of agree why cant it be just about having a fairer economic system, growing the pie for everybody!
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:23:52
Not saying it was but was just clarifying
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:37:36
I mean obvously lots of people have lost money but i would imagine a bitcoin subreddit would have lots of early adopters. Also, wouldnt most people in crypto have made money.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:12:49
Isnt it already. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:34:53
You mean 1 mounth?? Everyone can see your reddit age weird thing to lie about.

Good idea to bookmark the sites. Thenjust click on the bookmark.

Also in theory you could crack a specific address with enough computing power and time. But seems unlikely there would be a network wide hack.
