1. I mean that there are physical miners for AMHash, but not comfirmed for Gen 1 miners.
2. To defraud, you don't need to hack. Possibly, an exploit is to blame. We will find exactly how it happened when someone solves the ARG.
3. Again, we won't  know what happened until someone solves the ARG.
4. It could be either, we can't conclude that to be sure. The owners have said that they were working on getting the coins back.

It is entirely up to you to decide whether or not. If you feel like the value of BTC will drop then sell them off. If you believe that BTC will rise again then keep them.

The difference with this altcoin is that it is being led by a scammer who will most likely be publicly speaking about it in the upcoming bitcoin conference. The only problem is that when the scam blows over it will tarnish bitcoin's reputation, and ruin cryptocurrency for a lot of newcomers.
That's why manyusers are protesting about it. If Garza is allowed to speak it may damage the cryptocurrency experience for inexperienced users.

@_date: 2015-01-04 05:19:22
one of your biggest mistakes were guaranteeing a price floor. You put a sense of a "get rich quick" mentality into many of your users heads. The crypto-community is trying to put emphasis on using cryptocurrency as real world currency, and less emphasis on it running like stock. Many of your Paycoin users were looking to cash out and make profit, *but ultimately, who's going to actually use it like currency?*
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:00:41
Nothing good can come of a man who gives fuzzy information on his cloudminers, claims to have business relations with three major corporations, launched a massive campaign to lead a cult of dedicated followers, created his own coin because he believes a bigger, popular, and more mature coin doesn't stand a chance, claims to have a big investor to back this coin (but doesn't name who, or what), promised a floor of $20 on launch day (Never came true), premined and controls 97% of this coin, and threatened legal action against a media site for publishing information about them.
Yeah, why trust a guy with a history like this in a few short months?
@_date: 2015-01-09 00:50:05
I don't mean to sound heartless or mean but:
The guy took out a bitcoin loan that he couldn't pay back because he speculated on a scamcoin?
So apparently, he invested money into GAW, not having possibly spent time researching it.
While that sucks, and put him into a hole, this looks like another stain on GAW's soaking wet, blood-stained towel. Someone needs to hang these guys out to dry.
And someone needs to work on his investment strategies.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:11:19
It isn't. It's when you're promoting your own altcoin because of bitcoin's low.

With the history behind Josh Garza, *how can you trust that man?* He continues to denounce bitcoin's superiority. If Paycoin is legitimate or not, then *explain why Garza premined 97% of all the Paycoins?* I would be interested if you could *explain why bitcoin miners are no longer profitable on zencloud?*
About the btcmiami conference, *doesn't it seem wrong that a man who is defaming bitcoin is speaking about his altcoin at a PRO-BITCOIN conference?*
If you can answer me this, then I might have a remote chance at believing in Garza's statements, Paybase, and Paycoin.

If not, it may be unrelated, but I was contacted by a freshly made account (less than a half hour old). It basically asked me if I wanted to see porn and gave me a YouTube link as a "preview" along with a fake promo code. The only thing about it was that the link wasn't a valid YouTube link (when read), and had an embedded link to what looked like an IP address. Fortunately I wasn't foolish enough to click the link. What tipped me off was the fake YouTube link and the fact that I was randomly contacted by someone I never even talked to about a topic I never spoke of.

If a government were to fully accept Bitcoin as legal tender, then don't you think that they would require all Bitcoin users within the country to report their Bitcoin addresses to them?
