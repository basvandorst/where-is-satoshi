Love this! Guy says "Bitcoin ... just like gold two years ago." Seems like the loudest bears are the ones who see btc as yet another commodity to trade.

Did they mention the source of their interest? Was there a publication that old people read that had an article on bitcoin? Did their grandkids bug them? Perhaps they are glued to CNN and saw a bitcoin exposee?

Coinvoice doesn't accept credit card payments, which makes sense due to USD chargebacks for funds paid out in BTC. 
Coinvoice says you can "invoice" your customers, but they don't go into detail about what methods of payment they then accept from your customers.

Oh, thanks. Cavirtex lists their rates on two different pages, I should have caught that.
Still... paying 1.5% to save 5-10% on the price of bitcoin?  For those who wish to buy and hold privately, isn't this a no-brainer - choose Cavirtex?
Sorry to beat a dead horse, I feel like I'm missing something here beyond omitting the 1.5% in my first assessment.

Right, I see that. Let's talk this year. 
A lot of demand is going to flow in to a new set of Bitcoin peers.  The big two I see are ethereum and ripple.
Nevermind altcoins. Bitcoin peers will have inventive value propositions and not just iterate on bitcoin-the-vanilla-currency. Ethereum is making the everyman blockchain. Ripple is a payments network that includes an intermediate store of value, XRP. Do you know of others?
I think Bitcoin's already had its meteoric rise. If Bitcoin had pressure upwards to $100k in next few years, I think a lot of that pressure would be released into new peers like ethereum and ripple.

Ah, your post is sitting at -3 points right now, and perhaps you don't understand why.
Nobody has a problem with taxes. They have a problem with the IRS categorizing BTC as an asset instead of a currency.
For example, say you live in the USA. You purchase $10 CAD (Canadian Dollars) for $8 USD. The exchange rate fluctuates, and that $10 CAD is now worth $9 USD. You made $1 USD profit on that $10 CAD. You then go and spend that $10 CAD at overstock.com, purchasing $9 USD of goods with the CAD you only spent $8 USD to acquire. If the CAD were bitcoin, you'd have to record and pay taxes on the $1 USD profit you made off currency fluctuation. However CAD is a currency, so you just "win" on the exchange rate and needn't declare any profit. Unlike Bitcoin, currently, according to the IRS.

That link (and the other info I've read) explains how proof-of-stake differs from proof-of-work, but it doesn't explain how it solves byzantine generals, except that the proposed implementations (as of 2013/12) were "hybrid proof-of-stake/work".


So is NXT using proof-of-work or not? How does it solve the byzantine generals problem?

If I am interested in buying bitcoins and holding them, Cavirtex might be for me.
Cavirtex charges $6 for EFT direct debit. Let's call this $0 for the volume of BTC I am interested in purchasing.
Cavirtex then charges 0.0005 BTC to withdraw bitcoin to a private wallet.
So, I'm paying "$0" to deposit my fiat, then "$0" to withdraw my BTC to a private wallet, and I save 5-10% on the BTC price? (As of this writing, BTC is $637 CAD on Vault of Satoshi, and $600 on Cavirtex.)
Am I misunderstanding the fee structure for EFT direct debit and BTC withdraw?
How is Cavirtex not my best option for my specific need of buying and holding? It seems too good to be true!

I love that UpDown.bt doesn't hold your bitcoins. Of course they can still steal them.
Any other sites that don't hold your bitcoins?

Thanks Bryan, what a great summary.
Ethereum (and platforms like it) hold the possibility of lowering a few more barriers for online gambling, since the cryptocurrency need not be stored by any (however trustworthy :) 3rd party.  What are your thoughts on this?
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:17:41
I'd be interested to hear more about your reasons for - what some might call - long term pessimism.
$100k per bitcoin today would result in a $1.2 trillion market cap (today). In my mind, a $1.2 trillion market cap isn't looney-tunes big, about 10% of US GDP. Seems conceivable for a successful world-wide payment network. Of course, bitcoin could hit $25k and you'd still be correct by a factor of 4 :).  $100k/btc is very high.
Do you anticipate a successor to bitcoin, the Iraqi Dinar of the 2020s?  What will differentiate it?
It occurs to me that, if a group was interested in transmitting billions of USD in perpetuity through a payment network, this group might as well premine their own network and capture the positive externalities of their interest in the network.  Ie wall street could just buy Ripple and use that; Ripple market cap passes Btc due to the Street's tlc.

Why? A sample of the comments in this thread seem to think that XT and increasing the block size is necessary for widespread adoption of bitcoin. I'm sort of a layperson who tries to keep up and like to hear all sides of an issue

This line of reasoning is very American. It's the broken window fallacy[1], the idea that breaking a window and paying someone to fix it adds to the GDP and is therefore "good" economic activity. Americans (and apparently the Kazakhstan minister of finance) love the notion that being employed and earning income are sufficient foundation for a prosperous society. That's one of the reasons why America's military is so large. These employees don't contribute in the way that, say a paramedic, teacher, or baker does. (Sorry to pick on the military, but they are the best example I can think of.)
America loves job creation, but existing jobs are sacrosanct, regardless of productivity or benefit to society. Jobs are created and destroyed by the rising and falling sun of capitalism. You're breaking your country when you disrespect that balance.
