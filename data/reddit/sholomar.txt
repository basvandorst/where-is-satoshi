Credit Card Sized Laminated Wallets. 
Bitcoin: 
Litecoin: 
Namecoin: 
Dogecoin: 
Public service message for noobs: It really isn't safe to have someone make you a paper wallet with a bitcoin address and private code already included because that means the people who made you the paper wallet have control of that private code... if it was me making someone a wallet and they foolishly put 10 BTC in it and left them there I'd have a very hard time not stealing that amount to be honest.. make sure you trust the people who make your paper wallets... or use my free image and paste your own addresses in there yourself so you know your wallet is secure!
Then have it laminated... (laminators are cheap at wally-fart) and you have a weatherproof, secure bitcoin cold storage! Enjoy!
They are not fancy but they serve their intended purpose. If done properly this wallet will print out a nice, crisp QR code too, not a blurry one which I personally like.
Suggestions welcome.

If anyone wants them for other coins I can make them.   I do not have a color laser printer, so my wallets were not fancy. I could colorize them but I don't really see the need... they serve their intended purpose.   If done properly this wallet will print out a nice, crisp QR code too, not a blurry one which I personally like.

come on people, why are you not trying to find the identity of this person and dealing with them?

thanks for the info I'll look into this encryption but honestly probably have no plans to make or sell wallets. :)

thanks!  I'm going to tweak it to make the bitcoin logos color since they will still greyscale properly on a printer anyways. When I modify it I'll fix that too. :)
