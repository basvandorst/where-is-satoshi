Really cool idea. Need to read this when I have time

Agreed. It would show that cash is still much better suited for illegal activities.

What’s wrong with keeping a constant downward pressure on BCH and upward pressure on BTC?

I might be able to help you. Just sent you a message.

Here are the addresses:
Looks like the Beatles got 0.00154 BTC and the Biebs got a big goose egg so far

ASICBOOST is patented, and Greg Maxwell said in his statement that the patent holders were not aware of their technology being used in these miners, which would make it patent infringement

This would mean that the chips would have to support both regular and ASICBOOST mining and have some way of switching between the two. That sounds pretty inefficient and certainly a waste of die space, but it could be possible. 
Where did you read that only Bitmain is able to use this exploit in their miners?

Oh yeah I spun up a lightning node yesterday and like 9 of those LNBIG nodes automatically opened a channel with my node with 0.16 BTC each. If you look at those LNBIG nodes, their routing fees are way higher than the average. I think they’re just trying to become central hubs to earn lots of routing fees. Sucks that they’re charging a lot to route but at least they’re adding liquidity to the network.

Absolutely, you'd just have to keep your letter 80 characters or below. Mine would just be "Lambo."
I heard Santa's got elves scouring the blockchain for messages addressed to him.

To whomever wrote "roger ver tell that lightning don't work... hahaha" Sorry, that apostrophe broke my backend, need to do better input validation! I added that message manually, normally it's instant
edit: fixed it, tricky characters are no problem!

The purpose is that it enables microtransactions. Accepting 1 satoshi payments wouldn't be possible without LN! Also it confirms instantly which is awesome because now us devs can deploy paid microservices in realtime.
