Value due to pure speculation is exactly what we don't want. It leads to volatility and crashes, like we've seen over and over. What we want is repeated exposure. Once the average person has heard of bitcoin lots of times, they start asking what it is and become educated about it. Then, with any luck, they start using it. Adoption, not speculation, is where the real value is.
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:25:56
It sounds like you are more knowledgeable than me about the trading aspect, but do you mind elaborating on why you are using market orders instead of limit orders?
I would think those would protect you from slippage when orders don't execute in a timely fashion. You might have some stale orders you need to cancel as the price moves, but it's probably better than going immediately into the red. Am I wrong? I don't margin trade or use Kraken, so maybe there is a technical reason?
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:32:36

Not quite. Using a larger dictionary doesn't increase entropy, it increases the search space necessary. The amount of entropy present in a key composed of seed words is likely the same regardless of the size of the pool you are drawing those words from. The reasons are actually not that interesting, but the reason entropy is good in a key is that any kind of structure or organization (i.e. less entropy) can be exploited to reduce the search space.

Japan's economy problems are arguably due to the composition of their workforce, not their deflationary currency. There are many competing theories about the cause of the 1930s depression, and some of them have nothing to do with deflation. But it is pretty easy to make grand statements about things you have only a superficial knowledge about, right?
The electronics industry is most certainly deflationary in terms of purchase decisions made by consumers, and that is clearly what his example was alluding to. Perhaps you didn't comprehend this, and judging by your wholly inappropriate car engine metaphor, quite obvious you didn't.

Indeed. I challenge you to play a game of monopoly with your friend. Tweak the rules a little so that your friend gets the same amount of money that you do, only everything he buys is 75% more expensive. Also, he has to wait 20 turns to buy anything, but promise him that every 20 turns the wait will decrease by 2. Then, tell him that he can't actually buy anything directly, he has to trade his cash for yours first.  Sounds like a fun game.

I've read a few books. JPM invented credit derivatives. They were also pretty crafty in passing the risk off their books onto other entities, like AIG. These are facts that are well documented. Just because they claimed not to need the TARP money, and even claimed they lost money on holding it for 8 months, the idea that they didn't want or need it is a half-truth at best. The purpose was to bolster Tier 1 capital across the board. In this regard, JPM did not have a Tier 1 ratio any better than average at the time.

Bcash did not devalue Bitcoin, nor did any alt-coins that I'm aware of. (I'd love counter examples if I'm wrong).

Bitcoin is a currency with no intrinsic value. Either you are buying it to purchase things with it, or you are intending to sit on it in the hopes the purchasing power will go up (i.e. speculate/hoard).

You have to *do something* to the gold to give it this intrinsic  value, i.e. adding value in the form of manufacturing. In contrast, a necklace or knife made of gold has intrinsic value. By your definition, everything in the universe has intrinsic value and the concept becomes meaningless.
Intrinsic value is independent of external activities or properties. A business has intrinsic value because it, as an entity, can produce value that didn't exist before. A mining company that digs gold out of the ground has intrinsic value. A knife made of gold has intrinsic value because I can use it produce other things of value.

1) There are an infinite number of prices that are not the current one. The probability is very high that the price would not be identical, although as you point out, technically possible.  No data is really required to prove that.

3) I concur.
4) Nice username.

There is definitely some misunderstanding here, and we may be actually attempting to make the same point. Anyway, moving on is definitely best, good luck to you also. It seems while we've been having our back and forth, the markets have moved up.

That one lonely comma in the middle of that massive run-on sentence though....just plunked right in there, thumbing a nose at your 6th grade English teacher.  Your post was almost barren of punctuation, a testament to the speed at which, with nothing to slow them down, the words came pouring from your brain, allowing no time for the modern convenience of a period to mark the end of a sentence. But no, after four complete sentences worth of words, you decided there ought to be a pause. Right there - right where no man would dare place a comma, you ignored convention and the resulting awkward pause and planted a *singular comma*. You are a true rule breaker, a man who knows no bounds and bows to no grammatical authority. That comma says to the world, "I am GitchaGume and I punctuate when and where I please", although, maybe not its tough to say, anyway hats off to you sir.

Yeah. Exponential growth in pockets isn't unreasonable, but definitely not overall, and I'd wager that each near vertical surge will be followed by a drastic correction when the growth of BTC races past the actual value that has been transferred in from fiat (essentially creating value from thin air). Thin air is what bubbles are made of.
But, your graph is dreamy, I wish it were so.

Well, the point of my comment was not related to reputation, but rather that you can't assume someone is new to the subreddit because their name is new. 
But also, reputation means fuckall. I can have a million reputation from other subreddits and come here and make unsubstantiated claims about BTC going to the moon, and nobody should put any stock into it anymore than a throwaway claiming the same thing. If your argument is so weak as not to stand on it's own without the support of an established username, you probably don't have a very good argument.

No, my argument relies on statistical probability. If we have separated the probabilities into sets where Set A is all possibilities that aren't the current price, Set B is all possibilities that are the current price and we say the sample space is both sets, then the probability a randomly chosen price is in Set A is vastly higher than the probability it is in Set B. If this were not true, the universe could not exist as this is more or less how entropy works. Your nonsense about stars only shows you don't understand orbital mechanics. Do not confuse the probability of any price (which are all equal) with the probability of different sets of prices (which are not).
2) Ironically, you are contradicting your own arguments. You can't say all prices are equally probable and then say price stagnation isn't likely because there are an infinite number of paths between two prices. My argument above is simply a reformulation of your infinite paths argument, so you are effectively arguing with yourself.
