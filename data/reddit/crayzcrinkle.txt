Lots of people throwin shade at you here for saying it will go down... but it COULD.
Remember in October 2018 the price had been pretty stable for 3-4 months at around $6,000. We thought we'd found the floor of the 2018 slump.
Then the BCH split happened and all crypto went down the shitter. The price halved over a couple of months to $3k, and we called it "The Great Black-Friday bitcoin sale" which lasted 4-5 months.
So yes it could happen, especially if a major exchange gets hacked, or some fundamental flaw in BTC is found (or Craig Faketoshi actually proves beyond a doubt he is the real Satoshi). 
If that did, a sudden BTC spike is unlikely. Many thought "BTC Black Friday" would have the same effect, it did not.

I think I agree with you on both points here, more or less. But regarding the insider trading, with bitcoin, I do feel there is potentially insider trading, but only at the temporary level, and definately not what (currently) would be considered and provably illegal. The "insider trading" if it did exists, would only be temporarily definable as such....
To reach a definition here, it would have to be accepted that instead of a company/corp, the boundary of inside/outside becomes an amorphous group of individuals with access to information that has not yet affected the general price of BTC. Such individuals would then, as traditionally, attempt to profit over the time advantage of that information (sell, or acquire through some means the capital of others who are unaware). However, as the information breaks to the world, their status as insider dissolves.
This isn't much to do with my main point, but I thought i'd put that out there anyways.

I don't do technical analysis, but I had a thought about why T/A simply doesn't work so well in crypto.
It seems to me, there is an "Asimov-ian" weakness (like the laws of robotics or psychohistorians) in T/A, where T/A does not hold up because of a fundamental flaw in the structure of T/A? I am by no means an expert of T/A, but it seems that most T/A methods have grown up on the traditional, regulated markets. Therefore an underlying assumption is that the market is regulated, no exchanges exaggerate their volumes (or run off quadrigacx style with all the money) and an individual/group cannot have a big effect on unit value.
So this makes me wonder if, one day, there would be a method of T/A which would develop and be specifically applicable to crypto. Or perhaps, as time goes on, existing T/A methods will gradually just become more suited to bitcoin (as individuals start to effect price less, regulation is adopted etc). It would be interesting to see what happens, I guess, but I don't do T/A. So I'll never know... :D

I cant wait for  payday to increase my share a little. I still believe in BTC. If the price watchers amongst us look at the flip side of the coin... we're all a bit cynical when we see a big pump in price. We're expecting that dump. Or least I am. Take a look at this large dump today in a similar view. We'd all surely agree that the price of BTC going up steadily over a long sustained period is a better indication of real growth than a sudden spike. Apply the same to sudden dips. It's not steadily falling in price over a long period of time. BTC is decentralised and so are the sentiments people have for it. IMO, this isn't the end, its an opportunity.

You're right it's not a perfect analogy. The internet allowed people to talk to people all round the world so quickly. It allows us to feed and be fed information much more instantaneously. It allowed us to do something we wanted to experiment with.
Cryptocurrency is another experiment, but it's not driven by the idea of breaking a whole new frontier that a large amount of humanity instantly recognises as something they want to do, or is even necessary. It's the idea of offering an alternative to traditional finance systems.
These are systems which have been propped up for a decade by quick fix measures such as printing money and government / EU bailouts. (It can be argued that) The growing nationalist trade/migration sentiments of the US/UK are also stifling economic growth both at home and abroad.
It'll only be when the next global crash happens that the mainstream folk seriously start to look for an alternative to the complex credit/debt systems that will seem to be continuously causing crashes. If bitcoin has enough tech solutions by then to make it accessible, then I imagine in a very short space of time it will seem to become such a frontier as the web was in the early 2000s. It already seems to be finding a use-case in Venezuela.
Of course this is just what I believe...

Mining is Profitable. I've been doing it since february. Albeit until I did research in March and realised 4xGTX 660s was not the way to profit... it wasn't actually profitable. If you choose to mine, do research, buy yourself a power meter and the correct hardware. I don't get much from mining (especially not this shitty week), but I have managed to accumulate 45% of one months earnings from normal employment, in BTC. Nice to know I have the extra cushion if I was to lose my job!

These are all good advice here OP so do read. Also, get yourself a hardware wallet to store your funds, such as a Trezor or Ledger.
Money you leave on coinbase or any other exchange can easily be gotten wholesale by hackers. CB probably has good security, but time and time again hackers find ways into exchanges to steal funds (or in the case of the old QuadrigaCX exchange, the owner simply fakes their own death, to run off with everyone's money).
When you understand the phrase "Not your keys, not your bitcoin" you will know the truth!

I have a question for the long term HODLers:
Theres a lot of good sentiment and price rises which would suggest we are heading for a new ATH (all time high) pretty soon. For the LONG term (I mean people that have been stacking through multiple new ATHs for 3+years) how do you handle buying when the price keeps rising? Do you keep buying the same amount up to and through an ATH, or do you stick that money in a separate account when it looks pretty close, and just save the money there until after the post-ATH crash. Then when it's pulled back, buy up the motherload.
The price is now reaching the point where buying in, for me, would raise my average buy price. So I'm sorta tempted to stop and save (as fiat) anything I'd normally buy with until after the next ATH. Yeah of course, it will then (post ATH) still likely increase my average buy price anyway... but with the ATH then in the rear view mirror I think I might be able to time a good buy in with all the saved funds?
Would love some true HODLer opions on this...

As a UK citizen, I think so. I reckon if it happens (especially if it's a no deal brexit, which the clown running the country is trying to get) the GBP sterling price will fall pretty fast. Relatively, i think this will obviously make my stash worth a bit more, but hey if not I still got bitcoin and that's a plus to me.

\- That he signed a new will leaving everything to his wife (that he married about a month eariler) a few days before leaving.
\- That he suggested (in a public talk many years ago), that the keys to the wallets were on paper in a safe deposit box.
\- That he just so happened to have been under investigation by canada's fraudbusters in the month or so before suddenly flying out of the country.
\- That there has been no public posting of the cold wallet's address so the victims can see funds have NOT been moved.
\- That there is only a very dodgy death certificate which is easy to forge in a country like India. The body was alledgedly cremated very shortly afterwards.
\- That this guy goes out to one of the most unhealthy countries in the world, when he has a disease which makes him succeptible to diseases of the gut (e.g. Delhi Belly, which most travellers get on their first time going to india).

You are correct, and if I remember with BTC it was a case that the images were broken up into multiple sections and one had to use a tool to assemble the images. It created a legalistic problem, but I think the general consensus was that as a third party tool had to be used to create the images, there had to be a willful intent to discover, but I dont know if that had any legal basis.

OK So I have a question. I have a ledger S, and some funds (not much at all) on Coinbase. Now I'm starting to think about how to keep the gov't out of my business. I'm not some drug lord, or some industrial miner. However, I think I have previously sent money from my Coinbase (with all it's KYC crap) directly to the Nano's address.
Does that mean if any gov't was to pry into my affairs, they would forever associate that Nano S address as probably belonging to me? I know one can use "coin mixers" to have one's coins mixed up with other peoples and then sent on to wherever, perhaps I should have done that in the first place. Is it too late to remove the link between my coinbase and my nano accounts?

I'd prefer the dude links to some YT vidz explaining crypto in ELI5 terms and gets folk educated. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 23:12:37
If only there was some way to stop things like the QuadrigaCX tragedy/exitscam from happening. Like a second layer solution or something that somehow (trustlessly) verified that big exchange vendors actually had (in designated/broadcast "server" wallets) the amount of funds = to that which user's (client wallets) had deposited into it. In theory this is simple maths, but it could also a fail safe in case either dodgy exchanges or hackers tried to steal out all the coins. Perhaps it could also check if a wallet is multisig or in danger of one person stealing all the coins. 
I don't know about you guys, but I want Joe public to be excited about bitcoin. At the minute hacks and exitscams are voiding a lot of public confidence, from those that don't "get" the technology. I admit it was several months after I had had large sums stuck on coinbase, that I actually learned enough about the technology to know that was not a good idea. I'm not blowing my own trumpet to say I'm one of the most maths and tech-savvy people I know.
I guess any such solution would require time to make, and also likely to remain honest would have to use a decentralised algorithm, and require computation power. There would also have to be incentives, just like block rewards, and someone would have to foot the bill. Would YOU be willing to donate a few mBTC willingly, each year, to keep the big exchanges with their easy to use interfaces honest? I know I would!
Of course the solution is "not your keys, not your bitcoin", but each Joe Public has to learn that, and how many months, or years, might that take? Might the lesson only be learned after Joe loses coins due to a hack/exit scam? He might not return to the cryptosphere after such an event and may badmouth bitcoin as a scam to all his friends, in simple ignorance. I feel it's probably a speedier way to mainstream adoption nirvana if we can prevent/limit the hacks/exitscams.
I also know I am a shit programmer.

There was a time people confused BCH with BTC. The prices loosely followed each other. Well... Coinbase reports over the last week that BCH price has dropped 43%. But BTC seems to have hit the floor at a 12% drop from a week ago, and since 2.5 days ago holding steady around there. While BCH has continued over that same 2.5 days to fall another roughly 20%. Have we finally become unshackled?
Of course this may mean nothing if it's just measuring the pre-fork BCH price and not the new ABC/SV prices!

No one wants "dumb money" *gamblers* coming into the scene. That's people coming in without really understanding what they're getting into. Likely, such people will panic sell if the price drops, fall victim of a scam-coin, or mistakenly have their crypto stolen.

Basically Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is hard forking to create two (i think) versions of BCH. Craig Wrigth (Faketoshi) is championing one coin, Roger Ver the other, and there have been some very public fallings out between them in this last week. Basically a lot of people are selling BCH and it's dragging all  markets down. However, I believe whilst this may spell the end of BCH as we know it, other coins and definitely BTC will recover soon.

That depends on your philosophy. I still mine on Nicehash and make about £0.98 per day (yes not even £1!). My Electric costs from mining (i have measure them not estimated) are about £0.88 per day.
If you slice that as it is, it follows I only make £0.10 per day. BUT, the gross money (which is paid as bitcoin) I get from Nicehash, I am saving into a pile, keeping it as bitcoin, in the hope that one day bitcoin has a large price increase, at that point I will cash in, and if that future price is double what it is now, then instead of having only made £0.10 a day profit, I will have made (£0.98x2, then subtract £0.88) a staggering £1.08 per day profit.
Of course, if you have cheap electric (or live in your parents' house) then the costs can be much less...

EDIT: Both GBP&gt;USD and GBP&gt;EUR graphs i've just looked at show the £ strengthening against both. So maybe BTC price sorta has recovered, but due to the rise in £'s value the graph doesn't show the price returning to normal? IDK I'm basically talking from the rear here.

I know history is nothing to go by with crypto. But checking out historic prices on tradingview is showing some time in march/april each year theres a fall in price, so maybe there is some theory to people cashing out for their tax. This year, maybe the fall has already occurred (in case anyone didn't notice). 
However I can tell you this, if the price dives again at month end, I'm buying in, because in may/june of 2016 and 2017 the price started climbing. We all know how the moonshot went last year, maybe it'll do so again :)

As a miner I would also like to add that while I'm taking a significant loss currently. The rig produces heat, so heats my flat. 
The heat is not as significant as having the heating on, but is much, MUCH cheaper. Where as I would only leave the heating on for a short while, I will leave the rig on full time. 
My flat is not well insulated so it's better to get a permanent boost of 4 degrees Celsius all the time. Than a short term boost of 18 degrees that fades away over a few hours. I may scale back in the summer, but I will always have something mining unless I stop *believing* in the tech. Which I differentiate from *profiting* from it.

Care to elaborate? I must disagree with you that Bitcoin itself isn't going to be adopted as a payment method. I have purchased items from internet retailers directly in Bitcoin, in fact I spent BTC 8 times last year. 
I get what (I infer) you mean that it's not yet the go-to payment method overall. It's not accepted by the big supermarkets or Amazon, but it IS usable and it used.
I also don't think the success of BTC is dependent on the success of alts. BCH has lost about 70% of its value and dragged every crypto down. But as time goes on BCH drops are having less effect on BTC price.
IMHO and all that, but yeah feel free to change my mind.

This is weird though,  when i change gdax from BTC/USD to BTC/GBP (my native), that wall vanishes. and in fact $8939 is £6384, and BTC/GBP is showing a nearest order to the spread as about £6428.....?

What I don't get is why the red sell orders on gdax that are further away from the "spread line",  seem to get filled a whole lot quicker than the bottom one nearest the current price. It's like the system gives more priority to orders much higher than btc value than matching the bottom order, which if done would allow the price to go up. XD

All the Alts are plunging right now. I'm glad as I think as time goes on people will start to see that although a few have good points. It's easier to just have one dominant crypto.
I'm an avid believer that competition helps us attain better things. From household gadgets to entertainment. But Bitcoin isn't a private entity with a capitalist agenda. It's a new form of currency with a lot of copycats, which confuse the issue to the layman and cause him to cautiously decide to to get on board. When we see the Alts (especially scam-coin bch) dying off, I think BTC will take off. 
I think it's going to be a long time coming though! I'm gonna buy more on payday in this super extended black Friday sale!

Is there any way the exchanges could prevent such types of people making repeated orders of the same behavoir?

This is sorta more of an opinion that fact. I would like to assume OP has at least checked out a price graph and is aware the price moves up and down. Putting money in any crypto could be considered gambling, if the expectation is to make money in the short term.
But if one is in it for the concept of borderless money with low fees, or plans to leave said investment alone for years, it is more likely one will profit by it. OP I say go for it if you're interested, but remember the golden rule "don't invest more than you are prepared to lose". It could all come crashing down to zero in theory, but a giant asteroid could strike earth and kill us all just as easy... yet hasn't!

When Scammers and fraudsters realized what bitcoin was and how they could profit by it, we got alt-coins. 
Then the orgs and governments that wanted your data/secrets have realised how much information could be farmed from what you pay for, and so we'll get Libre and China-coin.
And all this time the OG bitcoin has been improving and growing more prolific.

@_date: 2018-04-12 21:52:38
Ahh i see, fees were unfactored. But I still don't get something. If the 17BTC is traded, whether @ $7730 or $7729.99 the actual difference is a gain/loss of $0.01x17 on either (alternate) side isn't it? 
In essence, compared to the $328.5 fees which'll be paid anyway, that extra $0.17 will be just like the first line of a really good novel, compared to the rest of the text.
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:22:09

That is absurd. Bitcoin is not. It has power because people *believe* it has value. It's no different to buying the house with a stack of paper.
The paper isn't worth anything much. Except for the fact it has $100 written on each piece. We therefore mutually agree that piece of paper is worth $100 even though it's material value is much less.

Yeah I am a fanboy maybe, excuse me for discussion on a reddit sub about the topic I'm a fanboy of (rather than going on a sub I don't like). I don't claim to know how businesses that I give BTC to do their business. Maybe they HODL for a higher price, maybe they instantly convert it on an exchange. They all trade in fiat and paypal as well, who cares? That's how they run their business. All I care is that I pay the price and receive the good. 
Given that, where possible, I pay now in BTC rather than fiat where possible... do you think those shops that accept BTC, would prefer to take my BTC and either insta-convert or HODL it for themselves, or allow their competitors the privilege? 
It's not simply useless as a payment method, that's just your opinion, unless you can point to some independent survey to prove that and your "99.999%" figure. I have stated that I buy in BTC. I, at least, can direct you to websites listing shops around the internet that accept BTC as payment methods.

I think you have to register as a business entity for vat reduction on mining hardware purchases. I think HMRC know what they're doing because unless you get free electricity, it's not at all profitable to become a commercial miner in the UK at the moment.

BCrash has lost 72% of the value it had a month ago. BTC lost 36%. Seems the daily drops on BCH are having less and less effect on BTC these days than after the split! Bullish!

Upvoted. This is a legitimizing move forward for crypto. It also offers somewhat limited definition for people who want/do get paid in crypto. I did lol at this though:
"HMRC does not consider the buying and selling of cryptoassets to be the same as gambling."

Lol is Craig trying to start a fomo bull-run on his shit coin? The little respect I may have had for BCH was for ABC. Sv has given me a giggle from seeing this!

I used BTC as a payment regularly, as often as I can. I buy electronics from UK stores directly in BTC. I buy from other stores in BTC and have recieved the same level of service as if I paid by card. My local CEX (2nd hand electronics store chain) accepts payments in BTC. 
You can close your eyes and say the sun doesn't shine, and be right, but it's only true from your point of view.

Seriously, they are slowly entering panic phase on the BCrash sub rn.
