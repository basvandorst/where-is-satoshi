Ok i'm gonna explain it as simple as possible for you. 
Semi jokingly i was basically saying the most you can lose if you get in early 2015 is 300 per coin compared to 1200 per coin early 2014. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:54:30
200-250. 
Edit: downvoted for answering his question with my personal opinion. Which isn't allowed here if it's anywhere under 1000 dollars. 
The voting system is so flawed. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:47:09
And we have to guess how it's relevant, right?
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:45:33
This is old news. Why are you posting it without a source to make it look like it's from today?
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:49:37
Sure. But not 800 dollars again. If you get in now. And it goes down in 2015 you can't lose that much per coin. 
Can the person who is downvoting all my comments please tell me why. I'm truly curious. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:13:49
Well, 1 thing we know fore sure. The price can't drop much further anymore because then we'd be at 0. So that's good i guess. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:46:30
Noone is gonna do that.

Ok, turns out this thread is just a ripple fan boy pumping the coin. Sad. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:16:04
Hard to prove this but my guess is yes. People move their money where the easy profit is. This has always been the case. 
But if you do that now you're 2 months late already. 
For most that means sell low (bitcoin) and buy high (ripple) and they will lose their money anyway when this ripple bubble bursts. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:07:35
Do you really expect people to send money to a random address like that?
And as much as i want to believe your story that picture just screams fake. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:49:09
Some people shouldn't have access to the internet. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:30:05
Aka Reddit Bitcoin. 
You just made that up i assume?
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:29:30
I fully understand this and there really was no reason to explain it like that. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:33:33
Uh yeah. Or it might not. 
Yup, downvoted to hell. Sorry everyone, i of course meant to say 10k and moon and stuff. I forgot where i was for a minute.
