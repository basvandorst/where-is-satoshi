What's wrong with all the people? why you assuming Bitfinex is not going to take responsibility???? I am still believing they will take the full hit and cover all loses for all customers and continue to be a viable exchange with everyone's support and become even bigger since they will have proved they are a responsible company. Now stop bitching and thinking your money is lost. They will make you whole!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's already controlled by 2 separate parties, all they really need to do is have hard controls put in place. No more than 1M USD worth of funds can be transferred within each 10 min interval and if it does, then Fire Bells go off all over the place and if it is valid then they turn off the bells and business continues as usual.

and I asked a few time too. he ignoring us.

Zane you seem to be avoiding the question that keeps coming up as to how much in percentage is that 119K stolen btc compared to all deposits held by bitfinex. Please answer that question, thank  you.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:23:21
I disagree with you that you don't believe this can be an internal job. How do you compromise 2 of 3 private keys + username + password + 2fa when each of those 2 private keys are in two different systems. It has to be a internal hack between 2 staff within the 2 companies. Heads need to roll and people put in prison. 75M USD is not a petty theft.

Good Plan Bitfinex and  (Zane) don't let the dumbasses get to you.  All you dumbasses out there, you knew the risks of btc and exchanges and you chose to participate so STOP YOUR BITCHIN. Bitfinex has done a wonderful job of resolving it and you should be thankful instead of bitchin. and the ifinex coin (potential shares) are more valuable than what you lose in the haircut.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:47:50
Buddy, you have NO RECOURSE, you are at Bitfinex mercy and you just need to hope and pray they will take the hit to continue existing and keep making money, otherwise you are fucked!
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:56:48
LOL and what do you think? you think each btc has a serial number that can be blacklisted? :)
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:31:19
Spoken by a guy who probably didn't lose much and is not too worried.
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:11:31
Shhhhhhh!!! we don't speak of MG?? here. Shhhhh
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:03:07
and what? you think that measly 0.2% transaction fee is their only source of revenue? lol
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:21:26
But all joking aside, IF Bitfinex TAKES RESPONSIBILITY and makes all customers whole again, I for one will not only be staying with Bitfinex but also promoting it among everyone I know as they would have acted responsibly and this hack has made them stronger so there won't be any future hacks.
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:44:13
AGAIN!!! you force me to reply... I can't believe you fools!!! what's wrong with you guys??? Bitfinex has not, I repeat HAS NOT SAID ANYTHING YET, why you assume they are bankrupt or they will screw you?  They are bigger than you think and part of a bigger organization and this is a very profitable business, 72Mil is NOTHING they are good for it. Just WAIT!!!!  ffs...........
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:38:01
Be happy with the outcome guys and stop bitchin!  36% haircut cross board + BFX coins was the ideal outcome. It could have been much much worse. We do deserve an explanation of how they got to the number and how much of the loss they funded themselves but in general it was the best outcome of a terrible situation and handled appropriately. Now stop bitchin and get on with your lives.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:31:12
SURE! as long as you also claimed all your gains for the past so many years with all your btc activities.
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:47:18
Interesting website:  
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:09:24
R.I.P. Bitfinex.  Nothing else needs to be said. Now get the site up so I can get my money out and you can close shop.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:55:15
The point is, the individual wallets may not have been hacked and the bitfinex storage account were hacked, which means we all have to pay for it as that account holds everyones funds, that's the way I see it. But hopefully Bitfinex is a decent and big enough company that they can tollerate a 120k btc hit and just simply make everyone whole and recover their money over time. HEY! I can day dream, can't I?
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:28:03
I guess you have never heard of back dating?
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:53:03
Zane please let us know how much in percentage that 119K stolen btc represents based on total deposits held by bitfinex. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:54:22
Absolutely WRONG! as others have stated before, it is a Bitfinex Loss has nothing to do with btc or etc or USD Cash.  So everyone needs to take a haircut.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:21:40
Ahhh genius! and you think they already don't know this shit and you gave them an aaahaaa moment? They know all this shit better than you buddy and nothing you, I and a hundred million other people can say here will have any effect. And to be perfectly fair, I am not sure why everyone is already assuming the worst, they have not come out and said ANYTHING YET and I bet they will accept ALL RESPONSIBILITY, they know better than you and I that if they don't they might as well close shop. So sit back, relax, wait and stop bitchin!
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:56:42
can you explain what the BFX can be used for? Will Bitfinex eventually replace it with USD and it is just a place holder? If I collect everyone's BFX and give them USD, will I become the owner of Bitfinex :)
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:23:42
What do you want him to respond to? bunch of people bitchin and trying to tell Bitfinex what to do? LOL They will do what they have to do no matter what everyone here bitches and moans about and tries to suggest bullshit ways forward. They have smarter people than you advising them what needs to be done and they won't declare bankruptcy for 72Mil dollars, ffs MGox was 850K btc not 119k, I think there is a slight difference there.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:16:32
No problem, I can provide an explanation: an employee in one company needed some retirement money so he got in touch with an employee in the other company and exchanged private keys (company names withheld for privacy and legal reasons), then they provided those 2 keys + username and password and 2fa to a 3rd party in return for a 3 way split of the stolen money which totaled 16% then the first company management decided what the heck lets bump that up by another 20% and make ourselves a tax free bonus and that is how the number 36% was derived. I hope you are now satisfied with the explanation. PS: if you are dumb, I just want to be clear, I am in no way associated with either company and this is not the real reason :) :) However, in a situation such as this where a large amount of money has been lost by each of us, humor does reduce your stress level.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:10:15
You guys can signon already?
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:15:57
LOL, and how would you suggest they identify the hacked coins?
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:04:25
how is it looking, does it look like bitfinex can take the loss, reimburse all customers and then slowly make up the funds over the next year from fees? or does it look like customers will have to go out and purchase butthurt cream? Just asking since if we have to go purchase butthurt cream, I want to be one of the first ones before the drugstores run out.
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:01:03
well, I sure hope you getting some rest while it is quiet in here, I think you will have your hands full tomorrow. Good Luck to you
