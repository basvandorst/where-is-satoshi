“Nobody really knows.”
Great honest answer.

Also lots of people that got crypto for christmas spent it instead of hodling. It took them nearly a month to figure out how. Most of them did well as far as spending at at higher value than when they received it. Excellent time for US citizens to invest their income tax refunds now that they know how it works. It is all good.

just remember that last January you coul buy ethereum for 12$ each and one bitcoin was 750$. I sure am glad I still have all the coins I bought then. when i get my income tax refund I will make my choices and hodl.

 load the html so you can generate a wallet offline. copy your public and private address. use the public address to receive. when you need to move it be sure to move it all with coinb.in . use your private key to sign the transaction offline. or just use the wallet once.

 Absolutely wrong, the increased activity is all do to Bitcoin being mentioned on the Big Bang TV show.

You are leaving out details about how the proof was found. In the US "we are told" we have a fundamental right to privacy. Once government oversteps this line they have become a government for an elite that robs the people instead of a government for the people. There will always be criminals but when so much evidence shows governments behaving like criminals I want my fundamental rights even more.

Coinb.in will create a signed transaction ready for broadcast offline.  Will make wallets offline, what could be more secure. Have bread or mycelium or your blockchain.info wallet with walking around bitcoin but store your stash in safely created and stored paper wallets. You can check them with

This would sort of be up to intel and amd to build a better mining processor to compete with the ones made in China, right?
@_date: 2017-02-10 22:22:04
Agreed. Thanks for the explanation.

Getting your first bitcoin can be a hassle due to the awkwardness of fiat currency controlled by a central bank. You just have to find the exchange you are comfortable with and take it a step at a time.

Probably fake news, I read a news article about the extended powers to the ndaa that allowed this under an executive order Obama signed before he left office. I will look, but I was concerned by the article enough to read the executive order and it seemed to verify the article. I don't keep notes but if you tell me I am dead wrong it would make me happy.

This is my biggest fear about Bitcoin. Without Constitutional rights the government can arrest you for having Bitcoin and anything else illegal and compound your problems exponentially. We are left with only one option, support Bitcoin and fight to limit the size of government. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:01:56
Thank you. A very informative article.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:12:36
I guess from my perspective, I use bitcoin because it is profitable. I use it for nothing illegal. I use marijuana but it is not associated with my Bitcoin in any way. However my VPN, Tor browser and Bitcoin could all come into play if I got arrested for possession of marijuana. None of these things are inherently bad things, and I am a good person, but a hostile government could imprison me for participating in this combination of activities. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:32:40
Yes it's awkward using fiat. Coinbase did sue to not turn over customer records. They will most likely win unless the powers that be decide otherwise. Hope you figure something out.

To make your paper wallet
 public address goes here
To check your bitcoins
To sign and broadcast transactions
To get your fee right
Be careful and follow instructions for each step

If I understand correctly, the block will have the public address where the unspent transactions came from. Anonymous but specific to the permanent blockchain.  This you tube video helped me understand it.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:06:23
It is my understanding that in the US your computer can be seized for any reason if you have a VPN and a Tor browser. Once they have your hardrive anything could be claimed to have been there in the first place. I still am going to speak out for my fundamental rights, and Bitcoin, and Dogecoin.

Wait three days. If you try to move it you will get mempool errors. After three days try again and use  to set your fee.

If you link a bank account you get 2000$/month limit. This has consistently worked great for me.

No, my mistake. Sorry.

There is no interest for bitcoin. It is designed to become more valuable so all you have to do is store your private address safely and secretly. The value of bitcoin will increase unless it doesn't. Your bitcoin is information on a blockchain that can only be accessed with a private acces code. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:04:04
You do not have to pay taxes on bitcoin if you spend them as bitcoin. If you use bitcoin to buy Amazon gift cards to receive merchandise from Amazon, the sales tax is the only tax you owe. You paid income tax on the money that bought the bitcoin and the transactions that allowed you to exchange the bitcoin for merchandise are legal bartering. You do not have to pay taxes on the bitcoin you hodl. You do have to pay taxes on bitcoin you bought for cheap and then sold for profit. It is called capital gains tax. I am probably irresponsible for posting this as I am not an expert. I am anxious to hear how wrong I am.

What about exchanging some profits profits to other coins like doge, ether or lite to diversify? Some of the other alt coins have survived a good while now and seem somewhat stable.

Localbitcoins.com. Find a bitcoin ATM near you.

I am not an expert and I have had good experiences dealing with coinbase but I am concerned that it is the only exchange I can link a payment method and purchase bitcoin with on a regular basis. I would not like having to go to ATM's or local vendors with cash to buy bitcoin. I am not complaining about coinbase but I am anxious to see a competing exchange in the US. I LOL at the post. If it comes to buying my bitcoin on the street I still will.

 Anyone who made any money doing anything other than just being lucky is going to be reluctant to give you advice. First, if they spread the word it might limit their opportunities. Second if they give you advice and you lose money they would feel bad. If you have to hold bitcoins to be able to spend them, then you have to grin and bear the changes in the market. When the price of bitcoins is high find a safer place to put any extra you might have. Somewhere safe and less volatile. Only speculate with money you can afford to lose. I am 59. I own my own home I do not have to leave my house to earn a living and I do not have any debt. Not the qualifications you desired but I hope I helped.

Not broke yet but I have three purchases that spread nearly 200$. If it goes down more I will buy again. Glutton for punishment I guess.

Smarter folks than I will be answering your question. You have done wisely if you have not tried to put the transaction through again. I did and had to wait 3 days for the mem pool to clear. I was not leaving a large enough fee for the miners. Here are some instructions someone gave me that worked perfectly. Use this site for a current estimate: 
So, on coinb.in, let's assume the size of the final transaction will be about 200 bytes (I'm getting 190 in my tests). Now the above site recommends an 80 satoshi/byte fee rate, so multiply 80 by 200: 16000 satoshis or 0.00016000 BTC (~0.14 USD). Reduce the output amount by .00016 to "fill up" the fee field on coinb.in.
If I have misunderstood, sorry. There will be helpful folks along to correct any misinformation I have given you. If you have the time to spare it might be a good idea to wait the full three days before trying again with the proper fees.

Be a sport, give them all 5 dogecoins in a paper wallet. Include a printout explaining what that means. Don't tell them their doge is only worth little more than a Penney, let them find out from research.
