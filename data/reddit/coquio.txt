I have to admit, I feel so smug as an apple user.

It's okay. I felt a little sting when you said that, but I forced myself not to react to it and simply own up to my dumb behaviour of opening my mouth before reading the damn article. Look at us now, the beef is gone. I apologise too, because you were obviously annoyed by my ignorance. Have a good day and keep enjoying your clearly inferior OS MWAHAHAHAHAH. I'm just kidding, of course.

Yeah, I fucked up, I commented before I read the article. My mistake. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:38:20
Oh god, you're right, I didn't read it. Now I don't feel so smug.

I'm so hoping the answers get better in this thread. I wish I had any for you OP, but my guess is that it's a mix of all of the above my friend. Bitcoin fanatics who want to let the whole world know about it and use it, businessmen who are smart enough to make a fortune out of it and revolutionists who want to change the world currency.

I was lucky to study two semesters in the Universidad Fransisco Marroquín in Guatemala, where the biggest auditorium is named after Mises, and where they teach Rothbard and Austrian Economics in general. So when bitcoin came about, I did one read, and I was all in!

Yeah, but you don't publicly say that. That's the whole reason the guatemalan forces were so eager to get him, to shut him up basically. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 20:42:29
Okay, but he did kinda flee. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 04:43:59
You're absolutely right.

He fled to Guatemala after publicly saying that Guatemala was corrupt and that he'd get off the hook easily. He spent less than two days there before they got him and extradited him. He sure looked like a bit of a fool. 
Edit: He was *deported* to the United States, rather than *extradited* to Belize. Thanks for pointing that out @_date: 2013-08-18 23:57:53
You should definitely check it out while you're here; I highly recommend. It's called [Zephyr](

He's too much of a controversial figure to just like, IMO. He did kinda murder his neighbor in Belize. 
Edit: He was accused of murder. I'm sorry, I should've been clear about that.
