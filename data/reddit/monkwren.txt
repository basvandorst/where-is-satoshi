Don't buy into easily manipulable investments?

Honestly, I expected the crash to hit by now, but whoever's manipulating the market thinks they can get some more out of it, obviously.

Oh, always. And I think looking at BTC as gambling is the right way to do it.

I mean, yes, most markets can be manipulated, but Bitcoin was just ripe for speculation and manipulation as a result. Anyone who didn't see something like this coming wasn't paying attention, just like anyone who doesn't see the crash coming isn't paying attention.

Seriously, I've got an entire warehouse on-call from Redenbacher's for when it tanks.

Particularly if this tax reform bill ever passes.

So it's *not* a monopoly, is what you're saying. That there are specifically exemptions written into law to prevent it from being a total monopoly. Almost like government regulation actually enhances the free market.

And you can still use FedEx, UPS, and DHL to send your mail.

Then it's not suitable as a form of currency.

As an investment vehicle, sure. As an actual currency, that seems unlikely. You want a currency to be stable - and that means it can't be jumping up in value as much as it can't be jumping down. Bitcoin simply lacks that stability, and as such, will never be widely adopted as a currency.
Also, I wanted to point out that your response to the question of "why should I buy bitcoin when it's a shit currency" is "to make it a not shit currency", at least functionally, and that's about the opposite of a compelling argument.
