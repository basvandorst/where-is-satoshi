I have some cryptos in blockfi... I'm hoping it's not some type of exit scam.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:00:53
This is fucking hilarious.
@_date: 2019-11-26 05:05:17
More like silk road, silkroad v2, Alphabay and a bunch of parcels with grade A quality drugs. 
Some pgp and Linux with tails and tor. 
Those are the real things that brought people towards bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:26:28
Well said.
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:21:52

@_date: 2019-10-03 21:51:23
Boycott Coinbase
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:59:15
ATM fees are insanely high dont ever go this route unless it's a last resort.
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:41:39
Well I know there's gonna be wealth in it but it's below my standard to support evil.
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:13:57
Looks I won't be using coinbase anymore.
@_date: 2019-08-31 09:21:41

Facebook will release Libra during the upcoming stockmarket crash it will replace the financial system. Libra is instantly accessible to millions of users through whatsapp and messenger all it would take is an update. 
Facebook knows what they're doing they're being powered by evil forces.
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:40:56
Yeah I'm switching for sure I'd rather support people who deserve it.
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:49:59
You guys do realize Facebook is going to start funding propaganda articles like these once they come close to releasing their coins? 
Mark Zuckerberg has a mission to destroy bitcoin and privacy.
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:31:22
Gotta downvote you cuz baby yoda...kinda lame
@_date: 2019-12-09 06:58:12
Brb while I buy amazon.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:25:06
Libra really is a CIA Proxy.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:06:00
I believe this person might be on to something...seriously
@_date: 2019-12-10 06:21:44
We can't do anything about it unfortunately this is what people are calling adoption. Only thing you can do is keep buying bitcoin and ethereum and hold it until then you'll be rich.
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:44:58
It really does feel like that with all the top exchanges as well. Uphold is the worst imo.
@_date: 2019-12-10 08:03:27
Ok maybe you have a point, what do you think happens to bitcoins value after the halving?
@_date: 2019-12-09 07:00:08
Next year will be more late than now. 
Buy what you can afford to hold.
@_date: 2019-12-10 06:25:20
This happens with me too
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:38:09
This is what I've been going by since day one, Its common sense.
@_date: 2019-09-06 04:20:01
I hope no one in this sub is retarded enough to think the Rothschilds are good people.
@_date: 2019-09-14 18:00:15
Delete coinbase and stick to fiat please
@_date: 2019-09-04 01:02:51
@_date: 2019-09-04 02:28:06
This is something Craig Wright would do
@_date: 2019-09-01 18:23:21
Taiwan already beat them fuck China.
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:29:36
Just a small attack on oil could jump bitcoins price
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:06:05
Yeah hopefully I just don't want to use Nazicoin as our global currency.
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:55:52
Time to boycott bitpay
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:23:27
More like Libra pushers.
Everyone here is mindcontrolled and thinks Libra is a good thing for bitcoin. 
Once Libra is released the media, the US government and Facebook are all going to start attacking bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:14:37
Agreed op is trying hard and failing

@_date: 2019-09-19 07:05:02
Finally someone who agrees and sees the reality of it. 
It's going to pop in 2020 buy as much bitcoin and eth as possible besides guns and food ofc lol.
