His name is Dr. Doom,guess why?Anything is going down the drain,in his opinion.When he is optimistic for bitcoin we should sell all and move on ...

The young dutch people were allways ahead of the curve and anti establishment,first here in Europe.Coffeeshops,Open Air Rock festivals in the 70s,Heavy Metal (Dynamo-Aardschok)in the 80s(even Metallica made it there in the first place-(Hello Zwolle!),Gabber of Rotterdam in the 90s,+++allways on the forefront.Only on the Bitcoin front I thought they are not State of the art-but now it seems that they are back with a vengeance!Good luck and more efforts!

The "sell your bitcoins and buy tulip bulbs"- advice is still missing in that article.By the way ,in Germany a politician is caught having child porn on his laptop.He bought the pix with Mastercard in Canada.Because of this affair the german secretary of state has resigned.When Mastercard will be banned?

I'm from Germany and I am using Kraken .It only lasts about 10 to 30 minutes to load some money up to my account there.So I can buy BTC really quick.And Kraken is in USA.So for americans it should work fast as well.

Tell them that an interview is waste of time because the opinion of the government wil be the result of the article.Fiat good -crypto bad.In Germany a high politician was caught buying child porn with his Master-/Credit card.Never heard that credit cards should be banned .Douzend of solar companies here get broke only because concentrating on gouvernment support payments instead of market needs-is the €uro evil?Fraudulent printing is the problem.Why not printing the missing money for MtGox.They are system relevant.Want to hear more bullshit?Bitcoin goes its way and no one can stop  it- 'nough said!

Lessons well learned.Lost no coins on gox - but some on the bitcoin24 bust.Police closed that exchange a year ago because of suspected money laundring.Few weeks ago I could withdraw some fiat-but the part on polish banks accounts is still frozen overthere.Not an exchange scam ,but I've learned No Money on the web or exchanges etc.Your PC is THE place, where the money is!Be your own bank!!

Kraken has some DDoS problems.The transactions have risen to +30000 BTC a day -normal average was 2 -3tsd BTC a day.I hope they reinvest the fees ,the customers paid these days ,in faster and better equipment and infrastructure.

Here  is a yt Video with the Prince of  Liechtenstein by EF magazin,a german libertarian magazine.Sorry-only in german.
They talked about the Austrian  school of economics,Mises Hayek etc ,anarchy and a gold backed currency instead of the swiss franc.The Prince seems to be really  open minded for all things libertarian.He has certainly heard of Bitcoin already and has a strong pro opinion.

The war state against the citizen is already on the way-Everybody who dont use fraudulent Stocks,Bonds or the fiat currencies is enemy of the state.Clear your bank accounts to the minimum ,go out of any paper promises and get into real stuff and digital money,which cannot printed ad infinitum.Buy land,gold, silver,long time food,single malt whisky,high quality furniture and clothing,tools and wood for heating as much you can get your hands on.Save this with guns and ammo ,buy books to get better skills in what your good to get better.Confiscations ,Cyprus style ,will come as shure as the sun goes down .Alternatively the FED will print the Dollar to death.Do not trust the gov manipulations of the markets,prices in USD are no more relevant.The stuff at your hands will be the things that count.
