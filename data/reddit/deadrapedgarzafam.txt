Any business has associated risks, and sometimes you have to take a loss.  I feel bad for moe, but he needs to do the right thing, regardless of the financial impact.
Moes reputation is on the line, and i think we can agree that his reputation is worth more than he stands to lose by canceling on josh.

garza is still a premium sponsor, why give a sociopath a stage at all?

Or you know, just vet his sponsors properly.  Are you saying that paycoin wasnt a scam when josh paid to speak, paycoin has always been a scam.

The Susan G Komen foundation is also a non-profit.  The CEO makes over a half million a year.  Non-profits still pay their employees healthy salaries.

If he accepted 30k from this dude for the conference then even more reason to look into the dudes background.  If it was only 3k, then i can see how the oversight happened, but it should be easy to cover such a small amount out of pocket or with a small personal loan.  didnt disclose how much money he received from garza so we are both just speculating. 
Sometimes, businesses fail.  If moe is that fucked here, he should look into filling bankruptcy if josh garza really does sue him.

10k in electricity, is this some type of multi month marijuana grow op or something.  You pulled those numbers out of mid air.  Find a better deal for Internet connection, cut down on electric use, no snacks this time, skimp on AV and printing shit and you have enough savings to be rid of josh garza.
