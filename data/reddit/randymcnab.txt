Thanks everyone. 
preev.com &amp; xe.com/ucc - both these gave the same amount converted from BTC to USD, so either of these r good. 
the mpago one gave another figure way off like 20 times more then what my btc shud be (even though its gone up) and it also had something about mxn which i will look into another time cant be bothered now.
So anyone who is looking at this, i can recommend preev.com and xe.com/ucc
thanks guys

so because a flag says so its ok for zionist jews to kill innocent ppl including women &amp; children? man fuck this i wish i never replied on here. if you think israel should exists &amp; if you think what israel does is justified I see you just like ISIS &amp; all other twats who use religion to justify their cold evil ways. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:15:08
lmao this is funny, do you think you will convince anyone that what is on the right is automatically what a zionist says ? ill admit they would say some of the things, like Palestinians have good reason to hate israelis (which they do they stole their land and kill their people and make their life hell on a daily basis) but the rest of it? lmao who wrote this table some pro zionist group no doubt
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:12:28
zionist israel is based on ethnic cleansing and their own archives document it and literally admit it, read illan pappes book he has all the ISRAELI sources in there showing what they did, and the rest is documented on videos and pictures, the last 2 assaults on gaza where in both circa 1400 people were killed, that was pure genocide, you are such an idiot to even try and say israel is peaceful,
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:08:38
not generalizing, stating fact. any israeli or jew who is nice and helps palestinians is not a zionist
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:34:34
I hate zionists not jews, I have met jews &amp; i have no problem with jews who can see zionist israel for its evil- btw you shot yourself in the foot saying about war and fear- it was war that put palestinians in the place they are today through no fault of their own, so you are saying its ok they do suicide bombings &amp; attempted stabbings? i mean because of war &amp; fear just like you said.......its all zionist jews do try &amp; play the violin feel sorry for us we are in danger so we can bomb gaza &amp; kill over 1400 ppl for that one rocket (which is a tennis ball in comparison to the military aid &amp; equipment you get)
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:23:57
show your proof, ashkenazi jews are too white to real semitic people, nazi is in their name, they are european more then israeli, and they are evil horrid twisted people who think its ok to kill babies, watch their planes bomb gaza, shoot innocent teenagers, and no amount of rockets or attempted stabbings from palestinians can justify evil twisted zionist actions in palestine (as all attempted stabings, bombs, rockets etc came after the palestinian had their land stolen, after they were humiliated , imprisoned etc)
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:12:04
i am the same , i believe (or like to have faith) in one God , in humanity, in peace and love and equality and fairness. It all gets messed up when humans try and say what they wrote (torah, bible, quran or whatever) is how we are meant to be, to live and then they use that as an excuse or answer for everything. yes i believe in a 'new world order' , and you dont need to believe in a cult or conspiracy to see or understand it, like you said about Attali....basically the rich and elite who all want the same thing in one for or another collude. what will happen i dont know, will they achieve their objective i dont know. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:08:45
yeh agree with the whole arab betraying their own, and yeh i have seen credible journalists report israeli soldiers on the border with golan heights taking videos and pictures of them talking to ISIS its nuts. I hate them all, ISIS, Zionist Israel, the monks who kill rohingya, the priests who live wealthy while raping girls and boys (watch NETFLIX documentary THE KEEPERS) to me they are all the same I hate them all
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:10:11
are you religious? I think it will fall but only because history has shown all empires/countries etc which meddle in intl affairs and try to control too much they always fall. the balance of power always gets shifted. Im not a big believer in religious texts. although I kind of like some of the writings about end days, you know anti-christ return of the messiah and all
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:44:25
lmao you are the moron for not showing the proof, where is the scientists who discredited the theory? i have met nice jews, i have met jews who believe israel shouldnt exist in the form it exists today and these HUMANs are the people i respect not zionists who seem to take pleasue in killing children and innocent ppl. FYI I think zionists r just as bad as ISIS, as muslims who think anyone who isnt muslim is a kuffar, they r like pedo priests or catholic priests in their welthy houses ...........etc........you are all the same to me
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:59:31
Being anti-zionist does not mean you hate jews or are anti-semitic
Yes anyone can oppose the 'land of israel' because you can not base killing babies and women on the fact of what Hitler or the Romans did to the jews
Most anti-zionists are not jews haters
All zionists or those who are supporting zionism are just as bad as ISIS, as pedo priests, as the monks who kill rohingya.......all those type of human beings (just like zionist jews) are all the same
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:05:54
are you zionist israeli or jew? I dont hate a certain people, i hate an ideology and anyone who supports it who thinks its ok to go take a land on which ppl have lived for 2000 years because of Hitler and what the romans did &amp; then kill, imprison, torture and so on and then play the victim and hold up pictures at UN of a bomb saying iran is a threat and all that, zionist israelis and jews are so happy when a palestinian is killed or murdered, the let them bleed to death infront of them (videos to prove it) they go watch bombing of gaza and so much more i would be here all day writing. There is nothing wrong with hating evil

ok, he is an attack helicopter who wants to bomb foreigners it said.....so he wants to be an attack helicopter??? an apache? i dont get it and maybe ill never be in with the cool guys if i dont
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:43:32
thanks for pointing it out, lol POE
and moral relativism, lets not go there...too deep
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:29:45
could be, but it said apache helicopter, which is american, and bomb foreigners, so i would take from that a white american bombing a coloured of some type if not , still dont get what the statement is on about....
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:57:25
its just something i didnt get but now kind of get but anyway still i dont find it funny maybe that is just me! btw what does having colored people in the USA military mean? there can still be a white american racist by having a black president so i don't see what having colored people in the military does, at first glance looked like a wierd almost racist bit of writing to me and i was just curious what it meant
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:44:40
lmao if the SJW parody is that girl being really wierd for about 3 mins about gender and stuff wtf funny.....still don't get why randomly it was posted on this thread but maybe im still getting used to the reddit code of conduct!
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:27:15
yes I noticed electrum looks good and seem pretty light weight. what else is there to it? even with my small amounts what should i be looking out for? i've been told to get the BTC on clearnet , then send in small amounts to a wallet on Tor (electrum) then send to another wallet again in small amounts on Tor (e.g. mSigna)....this should create enough addresses to keep me anonymous. Or instead of a third wallet send to a tumbler then back to the electrum wallet? does that sound ok? i hear what you are saying with 'there is more to it...' it seems like a lot to it!
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:17:38
kind of get this and kind of don't. can you tell someone who maybe doesnt see the obvious what the point from your comment is? are you a white is right american national who hates blacks mexicans muslims and anyone else who doesn't serve your agenda?
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:53:06
lol guess its kind of joke i dont get but we'll just leave it at that. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:26:04
ive read this before, not sure if it will happen, unless china wants their yuan to be top currency and openly traded. which is they do they (surely) move away from their closed in and communist style controlled country and economy. but if they do want yuan to be top currency then yeh, it could happen, will be interesting to see. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:20:21
no sorry, the articles I read was that china wants to trade oil in its own currency, YUAN, not euros, ive also read articles like Saudia Arabia will start trading oil in Yuan (which I doubt saudia arabia would ever dog they are USA lap dog)
but if its euros I suppose only real hit is on USA I believe, would be interesting to see how european companies like shell and BP if they prefer dollar or euro

I'm going long, missed 5200 today because I was busy with work.....i am no expert but btc - because of the fact it is limited and the fact crypto is on the rise globally- should be a big benefactor to see it rise again. past 20 even
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:02:20
Look at gold going from 1300-1196 back up to 1230, now moving aroun at 1200......then oil also....76 down to 56, btc volatile its expected....you were always risking, well said either hold to 0 or to the other way, maybe 20k +!
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:06:52
how are you playing the market then? long or short?
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:06:06
well said , i'd love to see if you estimate is right, a bout only a few people or maybe even 2 people holding 80% of btc
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:04:49
i keep seeing HODL everywhere- please can you teach a not knower what HODL is.....i assume it means hold
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:01:05
sorry I don't get your question, are you being serious or is it rhetorical?
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:59:47
Bravo sir, excellent reply couldnt of asked for better
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:23:01
why do you think BTC can take it? I'm no expert on tech or crypto currency, but from what i have seen, is there is a bigger demand now with many currencies (monero, litecoin, ethereum to name but a few) i have seen many more available to buy, which ones take off? which ones do people buy? Maybe thats why BTC will always survive as 'its brand' of being the first and reliable etc but never say never, all great empires have fallen and so can BTC
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:09:54
I like what you say and believe the concept is real but i doubt it will stay like that. 'People' don't all think like that....that it's for the people, free from govt...Some people actively work on making other people subservient to govts and corporations, some are to dumb to realize they are a bad thing....i think many people will work hard to disrupt BTC. hackers and making it illegal to trade are not only barriers, some corporations might try and trade it and influence it e.g. hoarding BTC, some govts might secretly try and produce so many competitors (or maybe just one competitor) which is advertised as better then BTC etc ...i wish it was as you say and hope it goes like that but I am sure BTC will have a lot more thrown at it
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:04:15
lol i dont get why you would be so uptight about a very normal assumption. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:37:38
problem i find is few vendors on Traderoute accept XMR monero. BTW you said to stay anonymous just use fake name and email. 
Fake name: easy
Fake email: i've found not so easy as you have to verify email address now with cell phone
unless you use something like protonmail or elude.in
I have used elude.in and its good

wouldn't say he is super super smart.....diversifying a portfolio is pretty standard, many standard business men do that and they don't need a paper from Ivy league college to say that they have the brains to do it.
@_date: 2018-04-14 15:10:02
but then capitalism is the reverse of what you said.....private elite, Multi nationals, etc, 'where all major public enterprises (trains, road, health whatever) is stolen for profit'...........
Ideally would be in the middle not too much private hands and not too much govt owned
