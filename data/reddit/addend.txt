But you explained it only by demonstrating that it really doesn't work. That's not much of an endorsement!

Honestly, all your statements here are kind of nonsensical. You keep saying things like 'There are a ton of variables and just-dice is the best place to make them work for you', but by your own demonstration you *can't* make them work for you, and can only push your expected return *close* to 50%...on the losing side!

That's technically true, but there are already many orders of magnitude between 1 satoshi and 100 BTC, so you can reduce the scale of the scheme and retain a fairly good chance of winning in finite time.
Of course you're right in general, but I think it's more important to recognise that this is really a substatement of the fact that any gambler has a range of sums they'd actually care about (not too high, not too low), and that regardless of what this range actually is the exponential scheme quickly makes you hit your personal limit.

The infinities are not important to the mathematical result.
Actually, you're right that a large number of people under the right conditions all have a fairly good chance of not losing money. This doesn't change that all of their expected winnings are sub-50% beforehand.
In reality, even this probably doesn't work in any useful way, because even if there are 35 levels you don't care about most of them. However rich you are, there can only be a few levels in an exponential scheme where (on the low end) the amounts of money are non-trivial and worth worrying about and (on the high end) where you can afford to keep doubling. So even if you have a fairly high chance of being on the lucky side of 50% earnings, any real gambler will have a drastically narrowed useful range.
This is also ignoring other potential real life factors like transaction fees, which may themselves rule out some or many levels. I don't know the details of the system.
