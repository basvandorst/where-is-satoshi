Yes, the drug dealers and ransomware developers are just 'idealists'

The dollar has world-wide agreement in its value. It's even used as the defacto currency in rural Africa.
Bitcoin is a small group of people, who will eventually get bored and sell, leaving your 'investment' worthless.
Invest in yourself, your friends, and your neighbors, not bitcoin.

Try eBay? You'll get the best price there.

1. Someone uses ransomware to receive bitcoin.
2. That transaction is public, so can't the system flag those bitcoin and count them as invalid? The victim would be out the money but at least the criminal isn't benefitted.

Invest in your friends and neighbors.

Who only accepts bitcoin? You are dealing with a shady business.
@_date: 2019-11-16 14:37:24
Now 600 BTC. Tomorrow 650 BTC. Makes accounting pretty difficult.

Please just invest in your local community. Get a certificate of deposit (CD) from a local credit union. They will give about 3% interest, it's insured up to $250,000, and they will invest your money in local businesses.
Talk to a trusted friend about it, not an internet forum.

Well yeah, 99.9% of the world uses a government-backed currency, so of course I'll do my accounting in it.

Thank you, but there's no point posting news here that discredits bitcoin. The people here want it to succeed, and so evidence against it gets systematically downvoted.
@_date: 2019-11-04 23:21:20
The prior posts have O karma. This is serious news and it's not in top or hot.
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:29:21
Great answer.
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:11:00
You say you love bitcoin but where's your tattoo?
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:15:02
I spent all mine on drugs, so, sort of.
@_date: 2019-06-11 13:10:13
You are absolutely in an echo chamber.
People on this forum own bitcoin, and have a financial incentive for it to raise in value. 
Any news that is bad for bitcoin, such as bitcoin's prevalent use in ransomware, the constant thefts from wallets, and the increasing use of bitcoin mining malware, is all systematically downvoted.
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:03:00
Maybe, but either way it's over a billion people less inclined to support what may soon become criminal. And other countries will follow suit.
@_date: 2019-06-11 13:29:26
Please help share this to proactively prevent such legislation!

Oops lost $10 million.

Why would an exchange lie about being breeched? They will lose a lot more in  transactions from lost confidence than they will in taxes.
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:24:04
I get it, but that's a bit of a stretch.
New laws = more crimes = good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:26:07
And recently "it just sits there... not an investment, a gambling method"
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:15:00
Exactly what you think, all of your money in bitcoin would simply vanish, and your investment in wool socks would skyrocket.
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:07:53
Odd how this major news story from just yesterday has no upvotes.
I wonder what else r/bitcoin doesn't want you to see.
