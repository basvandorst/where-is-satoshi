I'm at the part where you have to download the blockchain and when I click on download through torrent, it says 
"no screen session found"
cat .torrent.out: No such file or directory
Am I suppose to add some sort of file somewhere? I'm a noob with these things, please help. Thanks in advance

"the download failed or is not complete. Maybe try again(later). Do you want keep already downloaded data for next try? " 
What am I doing wrong mate, have been trying to download the blockchain for a week now, no hope.

Gonna go ahead and download the blockchain on a separate hard drive and the transfer instead, using the raspibolt tutorial. Thanks for the reply m8!
