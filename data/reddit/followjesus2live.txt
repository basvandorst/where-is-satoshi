We've been winning at t_d for 3 straight years. I don't know if you noticed, but we president now. The media has no teeth because they have no truth. Should have dumped into the nasdaq when our guy took office

A very definitive statement for someone I guarantee has never read a single executive order from President Trump. lol

Hillary colluded with Russia. Uranium one. President Trump has been cleared. You were lied to for 2 years. It's time to move on. He's still President.
He commands respect all over the world. China has capitulated on trade. Korea loves him for ending their war and denuclearizing North Korea. Italy, Brazil, and others are following his strong leadership and electing leaders that care about their nation first.
Gas prices are plummeting due to his policies allowing USA to become the world's largest energy exporter, plus his pressure applied to Saudi Arabia and others. 
That President Trump is a 'national embarrassment' is a false narrative created by late night show hacks, and reddit's pathetic echo chambers like /politics.

More empty rhetoric. Record high stocks record low unemployment, 20 year consumer confidence high, big tax cut, ISIS wiped out, North Korean nuclear threat gone, countless small business regulations squashed, illegal immigration significantly reduced, pedophiles locked up at 10x higher rate than previous admin. I could go on.
But muh Colbert and Madonna say drumph bad

What's one stance of his you disagree with? 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:39:16
Who cares if he's unpleasant? Who cares if two business ventures failed among hundreds? He's literally worth billions lmao
He dominated business, real estate, television, and politics. I still can't believe some people allowed morons on TV convince them a man with that resume is anything but a genius and a ridiculously hard worker 
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:18:56
Because you don't actually listen to him talk. He's incredibly sharp, and a tactical genius in negotiation and business. Basically he's the perfect guy to be President.
Like I said, think for yourself. It's clear you listen to what people on reddit and pop culture say instead of looking at hard data and first hand evidence

$3b net worth, all luck, or something. Or cheating. He's such a con artist that he's the only President to LOSE money while holding office. And he takes no salary! $800m lost. HAHAHAHAH. What mental gymnastics can you throw at this fact? 
Muh business failure rate! Vox told me so and it sounds smart!!! Hahahahahaahah
You hate a guy you've never met because drug addicts and pedophiles on TV told you to. His biggest crime is being the best at everything he tries, and having common sense

I have a beautiful fiance. Classic leftist response. Attack and insult the person because you can't deal with the truth

No it isn't. They're chanting we want Trump in France as we speak. Everyone I know here in Canada loves him. It's a fact that you feel that way due to propaganda. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:37:27
I'm Canadian. Look at us, or go look at France if you want to ridicule voters. They put Macron in place and now France is crumbling. America is booming and you still ridicule President Trump. You are acting crazy, going against reality because drug addict celebrities and paid media personalities told you to. Think for yourself
