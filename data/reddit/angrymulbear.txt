Simple, change the hashing algorithm every couple years.  
Hostile Miners won't bother sinking hundreds of thousands into ASIC development that will soon be obsolete.

Time to Hard Fork and change the hashing algorithm.

Got something to hide?

It'll take them years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars to design a new ASIC. In the meantime, CPU/GPU mining will become profitable again, increasing the number of independent miners.  
Jihan has far more to lose if the community revolts.

Facebook is already starting to diversify.  
Zuckerberg just needs to be smart with who he acquires.

And who's going to fund the open source project?

If the NSA ran enough nodes, they could easily find who announced the transaction.

Lets change the POW while we're at it, and make GPU mining viable again.

Miners don't own the bitcoin economy.  
The financial services industry has a lot more to gain from this than you realize.
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:51:05
Miners don't own Bitcoin. They are well paid for their services by the community.  
If they don't like the new terms of service, they can leave.

In the eyes of the tax man, it's better to pay some tax than none at all.
Use bank records and historical prices to come up with a reasonable Capital Gains value, and just pay it.

Make GPU Mining Great Again!
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:46:18
And who gave the miners permission to decide monetary policy?
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:03:04


If you disagree with the contracted terms, you can stop mining at any time.  
The community owns Bitcoin, not the miners. You are **WELL PAID** for your services.

Less miners will lead to a drop in difficulty.  
TX fees will also start becoming a miners primary source of income. If you want a transaction to clear quickly, set your fees accordingly.
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:04:25
If miners drop out and that hashing power isn't replaced, difficulty will drop to ensure a block is mined every 10 minutes.

The market makers will issue shares as needed to maintain liquidity.  
As soon as your order is filled, they'll purchase the underlying bitcoin.

Sure.  
Lets just cash in all the paper gold first.
What's that? There's more paper than physical gold?  
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:26:52
Why not?   
Better than a monopoly of ASIC's.

How would the ETF get hacked?  
There wouldn't be any public facing systems.
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:01:49
Fuck 'em.  
There is way more CPU/GPU miners willing to take their place anyway.
@_date: 2016-07-12 23:13:43
No, what we need is a central exchange.  
Right now, prices vary wildly from exchange to exchange
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:58:50
If the POW can be changed, it's a huge risk to develop a new ASIC.
