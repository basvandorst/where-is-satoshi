Happy to say I shrank it by 13 myself

I think what this diagram is aiming to do is show nodes that are connected to &gt;2 other nodes in the circle while outer nodes are only connected by one edge. If the lightning network were becoming centralized then the diagram would have more outer nodes with only one connection.

This. Andreas is a great speaker and really seems to have what is best for humanity at heart, but he is human. Verify everything, trust nobody.

Blocks are capped, not fixed. they can be up to 1mb (~3.7mb with segwit)

Can you generate another graph that excludes those 5 major nodes? I'd like to see how well equipped the network would be for backup if these were to go down for any reason / become a problem.

Good point, and if a edge situation like this were to occur the community would take steps to rectify it. Also I'm pretty sure implementations like lnd with autopilot look for these issues and try to rectify them automatically.

It may scale more, but it sacrifices decentralization by being more difficult for node users to verify the blockchain. The lightning network works as a trustless layer on top so that if somebody tries to cheat can be settled by the blockchain.

Good point, it's foolish to extrapolate future network growth based on a comparitivly microscopic beginning. I'm just curious of how resilient it is now

BTC works for commerce, this would just need to be a 2 of 3 multisig smart contract with a time locked refund transaction to ensure completion. Bitcoin is a dumb network, it does what you program it to do.

Ideally with more usage of LN and slow carefully planned out block size increases (see LN whitepaper section 10) channel opening/closing should become much cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:07:08
If I remember correctly this is where segwit comes in. If the other party broadcasts an old state of the channel trying to cheat, another party can come in and set the record straight. The cheating party loses their funds to the other, while the outside party gets a tiny incentive fee for setting the record straight.

You still have to have the on chain transaction to create the channel. LN doesn't remove the blockchain, it creates a system of networked payment channels on top of it.

By increasing the block size some nodes will no longer be capable of handling the network via storage, network usage, or processing power. This also doesn't fix the underlying issue of mass transaction dumps (remember there is no spam, only economicly viable transactions). If we increase increase supply 2x then demand will increase 2x (look up induced demand).
Now with the lightning network the blockchain is only a security for channels increasing capacity 1000x while keeping the blockchain small and easy to process as the channel is only processed by the 2 nodes.
The underlying blockchain should only be slowly increased to avoid centralization.

I believe the IRS classified it as regular income.

Very likely. The next retarget will most likely lower the difficulty. [Look at the second chart here](

This is why we need good keychain software. Each party should have a small portion of the channel set asside for the network fee.

Exactly, Lightning NETWORK. The name is a good indicator of what it truly is. LN is to Bitcoin/Litecoin/Vertcoin/(any coin that implements segwit) as DNS is to TCP/IP.

It could still be useful as a blockchain if their suppliers are using it. Assuming the consensus algorithm isn't 100% in Wal-Mart's favor.

This is incorrect, to have complete control of your coins you must have at least 1 channel pegged to the blockchain. So one blockchain transaction at minimum, about 3 per year would be realistic according to the whitepaper
In order for it to work with one channel it would also need to be set up so that the balance is about half and half, with sufficient liquidity.

As I type this there is only 5mb left.

Idolize nobody. Andreas is great and I respect him, but idolizing someone ends up leading to not thinking about what they say and not VERIFYING everything.

I received coins from GDAX via a bech32 address. Should be available from coinbase eventually
