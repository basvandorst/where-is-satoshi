It's actually preferable to have whales tank the price from time to time to redistribute some coins. We don't want whales controlling huge quantities of coin in the future. People just need to stop panic selling and allowing them to buy back in even cheaper, allowing them to take profit and ending up with just as much coin.

You're not wrong, but this is exactly what I mean by buying back in off the panic sellers.

Again long comment thread so it's hard to find everything that's been discussed, but has it been considered that amount of currency it would be easy to cause movements in any crypto, as such all the owner would need is an account with high leverage and they could easily sap money out the market by being on the right side of the movements they've created and they would literally never need to withdraw any of it? I mean, all they have to do is take a few mistakes to shake off suspicion and suddenly anyone doing well in the current market is a suspect. Several of these accounts under several identities (which if the silk road theory holds would be well within their grasp) and all of a sudden the money is moved to fiat without these coins ever needing to be "withdrawn" themselves. The user could just leave them dormant and do it again in the future.

It's mostly as a result of the price explosion. When it happened and mining became insanely profitable all the top mining GPUs were on back order and being mopped up from all retailers for insane prices, now the price has plummeted again but people have already invested in all the hardware so are running it anyway to get their money back, even though it's no longer financially viable in most countries (and by this I mean the total cost of equipment and energy vs the total coin expected to be mined in the lifetime of the hardware now means you'd be better off just buying the coin). Network is currently on a weird state as an after effect of the bubble.
@_date: 2018-09-29 16:13:34
Gamers use individual GPUs occasionally 2 or 3, and yeah there's a lot, but if you compare them to the vast mining farms they become pretty insignificant, besides which more and more gamers mine on their PC's when they're not in use. Servers are a different matter, not for mining. Quantum computers don't exist yet. I mean it's still tough to guage, but I really wouldn't be surprised to find out the majority of the computing power that is capable of mining currently is.
Additionally, GPUs and CPUs are irrelevant at mining BTC compared to ASICS. The only noticeable difference would arise if you turned on all the ASICS that haven't been purchased yet and are sat on shelves

It would come down to public decision in the result of a bug, if it's contentious which it probably would be, a new currency may be created via a fork where one would roll back and one wouldn't. For a case scenario look at ethereum and ethereum classic as an example. It's an interesting scenario that split the developers and the bug was a result of poor coding of a specific wallet rather than ethereum as a whole which is why it was so contentious. Some believed as it was a development mistake it was their fault and shouldn't be corrected via a fork.

Yes and no. Yes this is how investment firms make their money, especially against the younger generation trying to start their careers trading in it, makes for easy pickings really. But this isn't the institutional money people are really after. At the minute there is very little benefit to using cryptos other than a cheap way of moving money around, which is a volatile process as it generally means the money is only really on the network for short times, but as the development continues and confidence improves, more uptake happens, more money moves in and prices stabalise then there will be no need to immediately transfer the coins into fiat currencies. As it stands if you leave cryptos for a day you can easily lose 10% value, but if that was much less and varied by a few % like any Forex market, companies will be more likely to hold them until the next time they need them in order to avoid exchange fee's. This is the institutional investment people want, not investment firms manipulating the price to take day traders money.
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:53:47

Do some research into up and coming projects. Find a new coin you're satisfied provides something new and innovative that will really benefit it over the rest, for example PASCAL has a system where each user can make 1 transaction per block for free which is an interesting selling point (though the project is not without its negatives). While new coins are much riskier, they can be far more rewarding in the long run. Alternatively start building a portfolio with your money spread between these newer, riskier but higher reward opportunities, and more established, less risky but also less rewarding projects. As for the timing, it does appear to be relatively good, but there's ofcourse no guarantee we're at a bottom, we could still see significant decline. And most importantly, don't expect to make big money fast, invest in projects you believe in, not just think you'll make a quick buck off, and stick with it for the long game.

You'd still have to purchase the currencies through a standard coinbase account though, but yeah goes without saying you'd need to use coinbase pro if your aim is to become a trader. With the fees associated with buying and selling on standard coinbase you'd have to earn several % on each transaction just to break even. But if you intend to hodl rather than trade, there's no point in pro
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:21:19
Not many top projects are really looking at risk of collapsing. Maybe some promising new projects are failing off the back of the price drops, but most well established projects are still happily moving forward, in a development sense, regardless of these moves. Most developers realise that it's way too early to see this amount of money moving in, and a lot of these movements are just investment firms jumping on opportunities to make some money off the hype. This is indicated by all the good news coming out of many projects not being reflected in their price. But in time this will change, and as mass adoption edges closer more and more people will move in for the long run, the markets will become much more difficult for the investment firms to manipulate for their own gain and we will start seeing more modest price gains (or drops) resulting from good (or bad) news
@_date: 2018-08-17 07:06:30
So you can buy and sell for fiat on coinbase pro too, with less fee's? I was unaware of this. Had been lead to believe you had to purchase normally and transfer, thanks for the info. What's the point in their standard account then?

@_date: 2019-03-09 15:54:31
Depends what you meant by "stopped investing" here. If you are still holding, investing now (or having done over the course of the last 4 months) would bring down your average buy price and therefore your "break even" point. So if you think the price will recover at some point, not buying at these cheaper prices is a missed opportunity!

The reason is simple, the technology industry is dominated by males, roughly 80% of degrees awarded in computer science and related topics for the 2017/2018 academic year in the UK were to males. There is a major sexist sentiment among younger age groups (or there was for my age group) of computers and tech being for "boys".

Doesn't this just show the number of accounts by balance? To show the actual distribution you would multiply each segment by the average size of the wallet. This indicates the accounts holding 0.001 or less hold 50% of BTC which is simply not true at all.

You have to take into account the likes of coinbase who generate new addresses for every transaction then move that around into their wallets leaving a trail of empty wallets. Plus most of the major wallets containing huge proportions are exchanges themselves. But it does point out people need to start managing their own keys rather than leaving their currency on exchanges, they're basically becoming banks which kinda defies the pointing these currencies.

You see it as inevitable that 1/5th of the world's cash is in btc? Personally I disagree, I see many cryptos evolving and being used like banks, with the networks interacting and allowing transactions between them. I mean BTC might not suit everyone's needs. For example PASC gives free simple transactions, i.e if you only make a single transaction every 5 minutes it's free, no fee. This would be handy for the average consumer, people who don't put too many transactions through. On the other hand a PoS currency (with Eth verging on a similar situation with their attempt to break the miners into smaller nodes) would allow people to have 'savings' and gain a sort of interest rate. So this network would be better for people's savings. Ofcourse I may be wrong but I don't see one single currency being worth 1/5th of the worlds cash, I see many evolving for different uses.

Sia is another one that interests me, as it's working toward solving a real world problem of increasing demand for cloud storage. I have a handful of a few others, ethereum  a major one as I got into cryptos by mining it, but for all we know a new crypto could be made tomorrow that will overtake them all before "mass adoption".

Eth is very different to BTC in that it's not really trying to replace traditional currencies, it's trying to become the currency of the internet of things, kind of. I find Eth and etc interesting and follow both quite closely, I see one succeeding, hard to say which, I don't know which I support more as I'm fairly indifferent between the 2, I can see both sides of the argument that split them.
@_date: 2018-10-22 15:10:41
Well yeah this is true, coinbase do a similar thing and move their currencies around leaving trails of empty addresses. Like you said makes the data inaccurate. So this all has to be taken with a pinch of salt, but you still have to assume that a fair amount of the larger accounts are exchanges, while they may split it between addresses, theyre still likely to hold large sums in these addresses, I can't really see a large exchange holding less than 100 per address
@_date: 2018-10-22 15:01:11
This shows how many coins the account in each of these categories holds. Shows that most account hold between 10 and 100 BTC, and with a bit of manipulation would show what I originally said, how much of the market each of these categories holds.

I suppose this is relatively close to the situation as it is now, where bitcoin is usually necessary to buy into other coins. But I do see what you mean, you're essentially seeing the future of crypto to be structurally similar to how ethereum is with tokens issued on it. But instead with bitcoin being the main network with altcoins working alongside. But if that were the case, why wouldn't Eth just be used? The structure is already there.
I hadn't even considered the need for national currencies, I just saw them dying out and multiple international currencies rising. But I suppose each government would need a currency they recognise, and as you say, if that were to happen now and they were forced to choose, it would almost certainly be bitcoin. This idea has made me see a different potential, but it's slightly pushed me a bit more toward ethereum!
@_date: 2018-10-25 21:43:17
We're still in pretty early stages so it's certainly more approachable to more tech savvy people, and they're certainly more likely to have heard about it. I don't really see a quick fix, it's just a case of breaking down the ridiculous gender barrier. Stop telling people X is for girls and y is for boys. It's rife in every aspect of childhood from the moment you're born you're told pink is for girls, blue is for boys, girls play with dolls, boys play computer games etc. It's all ridiculous, it's no wonder we live in a world where people don't associate with certain genders, or any at all, when we've completely lost touch with what gender actually is. If people ever start to learn this then we could finally see a society where people do what they want, and not what society deems they should want. We'd get far closer to that 50/50 split in most industries, particularly the tech industry in my opinion. Of course this is just my view on the matter, what do I know.
Edit: Oh and to answer the original question, it isn't a problem, it will come in time, it's just the early adopters are more likely to be male for the reasons we're discussing!

I don't particularly think it's governments as much as central banks who fear it, don't get the two mixed up as governments 'often' exert little influence over the central banks. If anything it would make things easier for governments with regulation and adoption, in terms of taxation.

All of this is basically opinion, as some people believe  one currency (usually BTC) will dominate, some (like me)  believe many will arise for different reasons. Different applications require different things, and different coins have different beliefs over what is best. Either one will dominate and will become the standard, or many will arise for different reasons and the different networks will intertwine and be able to interact with one another. Basically no one knows which will happen. An example being PoS provides a kind of "interest rate" on your savings. A coin like PASC allows free "simple" transactions i.e your first transaction every 5 mins is free. I see this as a savings account and a current account. Different reasons for different applications.

I don't understand how they got it "wrong" when they're making money and people are using their platform. Basically, don't trust reviews.

The number of people I've seen discussing trading that don't understand what a spread is is unbelievable. People jump in, lose their money and blame the platform. Don't get me wrong there are genuine cases where coinbase are wrong, and they're expensive and have crazy fee's. But a large proportion of the complaints aren't genuine. They're people who did stupid things, lost their investment and blame the platform.

Of course it's effecting the value of gold. Gold's value is way beyond its usefulness because we deem it to be a never diminishing (due to its lack of reactivity) store of value. Bitcoin represents a new store of wealth off of similar backing, how much we decide it's worth. When its value settles and "mass adoption" happens goods, buildings, everything will carry a value in bitcoin without the need to consider "this amount of bitcoin is worth this amount of my local currency which is worth this amount of this countries wealth". Bitcoin replaces gold, and because we don't have to store it and look after it, it eliminates the need for banks.

Yeah it is, it catches out people who don't know how the system works. But you'll probably find the advertised price is straight down the middle of the buy/sell price, so neither is right. When you come to buy it'll be slightly more than expected, when you come to sell it'll be slightly less than expected. But it's how exchanges make their money. They don't exactly make it a secret 
Actually I take this back, talking in £ coinbase are quoting 4900 right now. I try to sell and it quotes 4918 I try to buy and it's 4968. So it's not 4900 at all, how strange

It is possible to earn some money mining with a 1080ti, they're efficient enough mining to do so if you happen to have it there anyway. Whattomine will have a lot of info, you'll most likely find ethereum to be highest profit potential. A larger coin like this you would have to mine in a pool as it would be almost impossible to find a block by yourself. You could find a smaller coin you like and mine that solo if you would prefer, but they're likely to be less profitable. In terms of revenue you're likely to earn very little, but slightly more than your energy cost. All this can be easier, there are "easy mode" mining programs like nicehash and honeyminer which do all the work for you and even choose the most profitable coin to mine, you'll earn less than if you did all the research into over/underclocking and everything you can to maximise profits, but they're much much easier to set up.
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:46:49
I don't understand what you mean "misrepresent". They have different prices between their pro and standard accounts is all. It's common. Most of the time you will also be told the going rate to buy a coin, not how much they will buy it off you for. And the two will differ significantly. Coinbase are particularly bad for not giving a great price and having high fee's. I've started using a rival who gives slightly worse rates but no fees and it works out cheaper. Just gotta do your research.

The mining scene creates a spread of profitability depicted primarily by local governing. The cost of energy and goods in your area, taxation etc. Some countries are far far more profitable. As the price and mining rewards decrease, older devices and people located in expensive to live regions are the first to turn off, and in doing so increase profitability slightly for the rest. It's worth noting however some things actually mitigate the decline in mining profitability. For example when BTC was at 20k, someone moving 20k across the network would have to move 1 BTC, and the, let's say 20c, fee would be deducted as 0.000001 BTC (please excuse if I'm out by a 0 or 2). Now, to move 20k across the network they would have to move 4 BTC, and the cost would be 4x higher in BTC, but still be same in $ value. So miners receive more BTC because people use more in transactions. So it's not a direct decline in profitability with decline in value.

Well that's because the price got huge really quickly on pure hype. For a brief amount of time mining did become super profitable, even as a small time hobby miner I was all of a sudden earning more from mining than my full time job. And the network costs were insane too if you remember, because these adjustments usually happen slowly over long periods of time. I'm talking how mining works in normal times, like these days where we're approaching a price level depicted by network strength and usability rather than speculation.

Some people just don't get the concept of how money works apparently. They just seem to think it disappears and reappears at will. Everyone's winning! Monies appearing out of thin air! What a great world they live in.

It works on averages. Not specific trades. But you know, do whatever you need to convince yourself that everyone's winning. I'm not knocking the market, everyone gets into it knowing exactly this, or I though they did anyway. Who says this person is going to sell at 10k? They could sell at 2.5. the price could never get to 10k again. It might take 5 years. This person might get out the market before then. And on average many people will do this. Because as I said before, for every $ earned, someone else loses one. You become better than the average trader you earn money, you're worse than the average, you lose.

This is exactly what drives mining hashrate, but it is a reflection on price. Asides from some billionaires hijacking hashrate to fight a hashwar and screwing things up, and a huge speculation bubble causing crazy spikes, it's entirely down to profitability. Under normal conditions increasing value means less efficient machines can earn a profit, hashrate increases. Price goes down, less efficient machines dip into non-profitability and turn off. There are slightly more factors such as those miners who are also holding what they mine and don't mind temporarily dipping into non profit and would rather just keep the machines running, but if they're smart, even they would turn off if the electricity alone is costing more than they're mining because they could just be saving their equipment some hassle and buying the coins for less cost instead. Fortunately having a spread of efficiency (both in terms of differences in energy cost and tax rates on the equipment) stops everyone from turning off simultaneously and the difficulty algorithm dynamically changes to keep the network running at the same rate.

Of course there is, if you nominate a too low fee your transaction will never be included in a block. No miners would be making profit if the value dropped 75% and mining fees didn't change to compensate.

Where on earth do you think money appears from if everyone wins? It's an exchange. Just on averages it should be obvious that for every $ earned by someone, someone else has lost a $. In fact, someone else has lost more than a $ when you take into account market fees too.

You can't disagree. All trading of all assets is exactly like this. Traders do nothing to help the ecosystem. People that come here to earn a quick buck are the ones losing their money. Good riddance. People that use crypto's to buy goods, pay for services, the ones that develop, host nodes, mine. They help. And they don't get put off by statements like this.
