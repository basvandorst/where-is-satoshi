Thank you so much, this is what I was looking for!!
There are no benchmarks for how much per transaction to pay as a fee to get the transaction done in for example 24hrs, 48hrs, 3 days etc? (some real time statistics or something?

Thanks! But how is it on coinbase though again?
Let's say method one (which method will be applied anyways? one or two?) for EUROPE it says:
Standard buy / sell: 1.49%
Credit / Debit Card Buys: 3.99%
Bank Transfer (SEPA): Free / €0.15
Does that mean that I'd have to pay 1.49% + 3.99% in fee's if I purchase bitcoins via my credit card on coinbase?
For 200€ -&gt; 10,96€ in fees?
I purchased 200€ in bitcoins with CC and ended up with 195€ or 197€ (I don't really remember) so the maths above doesn't really make sense

Thank you sally, that makes actually sense I wasn't really aware of that tbh!

Thanks but still I'd like to have a response to my actual question regarding the calculations of fees on coinbase just to understand!
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:21:57
Is it reliable and trust worhty? I am quite new to this whole BTC stuff and don't wanna get ripped off :D

Yup prolly going to do that. Changelly is private right? Meaning that at the point of the exchange the trace of bitcoins will be lost?
Also, I have been reading quite the bad reviews about people losing their money. Fortunately I only need to exchange small amounts, still troublesome though.

Monero still unavailable :( 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:49:02
I'd  still prefer exchanges tbh :S
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:08:18
Oh that's right, I just saw that! If change the fees to a really low amount, how long will the payment take approx to process?
Also- what do you guys think, starting from which amount are bitcoin payments in regards to the fees "worthwhile"?
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:23:43
Thanks but it looks like it needs registration etc. 
I was looking for something just like shapeshift.io
Still will look into your suggestion as we speak. Thanks

I am not verified on coinbase though, would that still work with GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:20:55
how fast are bittrex or binance? I wanted ot get coins before the weekend :S
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:05:15
Hmm this could be the case, I am not remembering precisely but I THOUGHT that I had 195€ directly after buying it, maybe it was actually a fluctuation happening since bitcoin changes intraday easily 1+% right?

Even with the lowest fee option on electrum I'd pay around $10 USD in fees for small amounts ...that's quite high

Thanks for your response!

Thank you! I am just having struggles with the stupid ID verification as coinbase is having a hard time with the traffic that is coming in!
So Binance works "up to 2 BTC" without ID? And there are no issues with hacking or tether or something? I'd love to get some bitcoins NOW (well 0.xxx coins to be precise, not full coins)!
