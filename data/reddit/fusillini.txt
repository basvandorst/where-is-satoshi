Do you mean using reusing the transaction signature? I'm interested in whether checklocktimeverify could be used as an age-weighed staking mechanism. Such that for 2 transactions with the same output, the one that has been locked the longest (block height since first lock) has more weight in a stake commitment comparison vs another which has been locked for less time.

So it's as simple as just creating another transaction with the same outputs but longer locktime?

this is all very agreeable indeed

A few people are confused so here is an ELI5:
SSL certificates ensure that the website you're visiting (i.e. facebook.com) is the real deal and not a spoof someone made to trick you or worse, steal your password, credit card, etc - this can easily happen if your router is compromised or if you're using a public network.
There are a number of certificate authorities which are officially recognized by browsers. Basically your browser's trusts that certificate X issued by authority Y is telling the truth that facebook.com is owned by Mr. Zuckerberg. You can usually verify this by a nice green indicator next to the address bar, try clicking it to get more info about the certificate.
AFAIK there was only 1 authority which provided free certificates (StartSSL), their platform is pretty out-dated though and they don't offer auto-renewals. So this news about letsencrypt is pretty awesome for system administrators :)
Hope that sheds some light!

Correct, this is just a tool for someone who prefers the convenience and is comfortable working inside the terminal.

Makes sense if they're shorting BCH.

It's a handout in the sense that it provides these companies with a cheap line of credit, which in turn gives them an unfair advantage over other ventures. I'm failing to see your perspective of how this is ethical practice in the case of VW.
@_date: 2016-12-17 22:34:32
What's ethical about giving VW a handout after the emissions scandal?

Throwing personal attacks at me and the author does nothing to reinforce your argument.
My expectations have nothing to do with the fact that there is a clearly something wrong with this situation that the ECB is perpetrating. No matter what "level" you look at it.
You obviously think that this behavior is ethical which is where we diverge in opinion. Whether or not it's a good investment like you claim, well... I guess we'll find out!
Have a good one!

Great new look! It would be good to have the exchange rates you offer visible in the front-end as well as deposit/withdrawal fees.

As others have mentioned, get a ledger or a trezor, use that as your cold storage.
There are a few days you can then store your seed words. Seeing that you seem to know a few people in the community why not give a copy with just half of the words to a bunch of them, asking them to store it for you, then put the other half unencrypted into your email / drop / somewhere in the cloud.
Alternatively on an offline computer encrypt the seed words with AES and a password, then store the hash anywhere in the cloud. You can even convert the hash into a qr code, print a bunch of copies and put them inside nooks and crannies of your house and carry a copy in your wallet.
With a little creativity there are many ways to secure your btc.
Sorry for your loss.

Coinbase was where I first dipped my toes into bitcoin. They are a great company by many measures.
I recently went through the hiring process with them and it was a nightmare. Ruthless, prolonged, unprofessional and arrogant.
The way companies treat potential applicants speaks volumes to me. I wish them a lot of luck, but I'll never do business with them again.

I don't have much experience in mining with solar but just wanted to say thanks for your post. It's really inspiring to see folks out there investing in a sustainable future. I hope I can do something like this in Portugal one day :) keep us updated and good luck!!

It was for the remote software engineer position publicized by Brian in a few medium blog posts / tweets.
I had to pass a hackerank test to prove my coding competency first, then a friendly HR interview followed by an awkward one with a director.
The whole process took 2 months, after a week of not hearing back from them I followed up to be told that due to an internal system crash they had "lost" my file and had to chase it up with my interviewers.
Later I was told that other more suitable candidates had applied and that they would not be following up with my application.
No feedback on why I wasn't fit for the position. 
That's basically it. The position was for infrastructure which seems ironic considering the crash that lost my file and later the gdax launch outages.

Number of full nodes is indeed a flawed measure if you're unable to distinguish sybil from economic nodes (I.e. nodes that are used to broadcast transactions from exchanges, businesses and real users).
In the context of UASF however, success isn't measured by that metric, so it's irrelevant. If enough economic nodes join UASF, then it doesn't matter how many sybil non-economic nodes exist.
