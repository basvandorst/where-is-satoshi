CPU mining would not be ideal because people employing Botnets would have a massive advantage.  I'm not enough of an expert to explain the differences, but the main drawback with the equihash algorithm is it requires memory bandwidth not just a lot of memory, which the latest GPU cards are actually optimized for. 
In return for backing the crowdfund you will be supplied with a GPU miner prior to Zcash launch, built by trustworthy developers that have a reputation for optimizing GPU miners.

Adam, I agree, in hindsight, maybe I shouldn't have posted this because he is trying to avoid the limelight. I wasn't intending to "promote," but "share" what I made - being as there is a shortage of Bitcoin related artwork.
I was planning on sharing all of my artwork for my upcoming Bitcoin Art Show with r/bitcoin. This just happened to be one of my first pieces, because Andreas has been an inspiration to me. It was an easy starting point. 
Certainly, I am reconsidering my tactics. If wishes me to take this down, I will do so immediately.

Correct, this is just one portrait that belongs to a series.

We have very different philosphies, and that's fine. But I see "Bitcoin" as the the whole sphere - the technology, the ideology, the community. And you're right - there isn't "one view," that speaks for Bitcoin. So first of all, my interpretations are coming from my own experiences, and second, I aim to include the many people, ideas, and technologies within the "sphere." 
Bitcoin is a multifaceted tool, a financial tool, but it is also a revolutionary tool. If you dismiss that, then you're missing the larger picture.  
Blockchain technology isn't defined by bitcoin, and because of this, we are in the midst of a movement - an era of enlightenment. A movement that is incredibly dynamic, and will require more than one artist to capture.

I'm doing many portraits of Bitcoiners. I don't believe portraits of people "in the field," qualifies as worship. I'm also making work about Bitcoin ideology. Andreas is "just a guy," but he has done a lot for the community, and works very hard. There are many people who deserve recognition.

Recently, Andreas took the time to sit down with me and discuss the design pattern of the blockchain. It was important for me to include him in my series because he has had an impact on my Bitcoin experience.

Or he just thought it was an oddball drawing ;) but let me ask you this: If you were at a Bitcoin Artshow, and you had no idea about Bitcoin, would you find portraits of people interesting? 
I think it's important to include portraits of people, perchance the audience - of which the majority will be non-bitcoiners, would like to delve deeper. I think Andreas provides a great starting point for people who are trying to learn about Bitcoin. There are many great starting points, and conversation pieces to be made. I hope other artists will join the effort. Bitcoin needs more Art.
