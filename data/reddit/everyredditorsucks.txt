Yeah - the changes in the cryptosphere that have led to ~1500% gains in my holdings over the last year are terrifying to me. I feel very threatened.
And pick one lie and stick to it. Either you’ve held BTC since 2013, or you sold it and went all in on BCAsh. In which case you’re down nearly 20% compared to BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:56:37
Hahahaha so you held Bitcoin through a massive crash and then through 2.5 years of bear markets and near collapse - and then as it finally begins to show signs of the success we’ve all known was possible, you sell it all for a 6-month old shitcoin because “ppl are talking”, and that coin has now done nothing for you except lose significant value compared to BTC. Nice timing - great strategy. You clearly understand the point of long term investing - and that is to completely liquidate your portfolio when you read random nonsense on Reddit from bcash shills.
I guess you can choose: you’re either completely full of shit or you’re a total fucking idiot. Either way, the fact that you think your position is defensible is hilarious.
And it’s bcash - but you have a lot more important things to be concerned about.

Hahaha you think this is triggered? I'm literally laughing at you.
You're an idiot who is doomed to lose what little money you've accrued with this investment strategy. My only hope is that the bcash bag holders are all as stupid as you, and not innocent investors that have been lied to.

Much better than bcash over the same period. And the various shit coin forks (bcash and BTG) gave me the opportunity to acquire more Bitcoin.
P.S. “Long term” investors don’t go “all in” because “people are talking”. They go all in because they understand and believe in the tech/development.

On a thread about how the power will “transition” from BTC to BCH. If that nonsense made you go all in, I pray you didn’t actually have much money to invest. BCash is a 6-month old, centrally mined, artificially thinly traded, underdeveloped, shitcoin. Never go full bcash.
Also - I’ve been holding Bitcoin since 2013 - and my investment strategy has nothing to do with Reddit threads.

That is not how it works. This is making Bitcoin accessible to a new user base. If it increases buying or overall adoption that cannot possibly be "factored in" yet, because the extent of the impact is unpredictable.

Baron Rothschild's quote about blood in the streets refers to contrarian investing strategy - it has nothing to do with whether you're investing in companies, assets, bonds or real estate. The quote merely refers to the fact that contrarian investors believe the greatest profit potential lies in going against the crowd. Rothschild felt that momentum caused the market to be consistently wrong in its evaluations at extreme highs and lows. (Buy low/Sell high)
Buying when there's blood in the streets means investing in anything that has seen an unjustified drop in price compared with steady value fundamentals. If you believe the value of BTC has remain unchanged, but it's price has dropped, then you should invest. The same goes for the house down the street, or the antique vase in a store window. It has absolutely nothing to do with whether you're investing in a company or not.

The point is: they weren't TRYING to accurately predict the election, just like they wouldn't be TRYING to accurately predict odds of impeachment. They're just trying to accurately gauge the perception of those gambling in order to maximize wagers on both sides. That's it.

If 1 mBTC = $1000
then 1 BTC = $1,000,000
so BTC market cap = $21 trillion
To reach that level the market cap would need to increase by an average of $1 million **per day** for the next **60 years**


You're gonna need to wait a bit.
EDIT: I've made a terrible mistake... it's actually **60,000 years**

Credit Cards all charge standard fees of ~2-2.5%, plus ~$0.10 per transaction, PLUS monthly fees for gateways and card swiping terminals. All of this adds up to much more than the BTC fees we are discussing - you're just not aware of them, because the business is responsible and so you pay the fees in the form of marked up prices on the goods you purchase.
Also, we're talking about 10% fees, so unless you're buying coffee at $10/cup, you will not be 


I'm assuming at this point that you're incapable of doing simple math, so let me help. Cup of coffee = ~$3.00, meaning $0.30 in fees. You absolutely do pay at least this much in CC fees, you just don't realize it.


Bank transfers are not free - I don't know what you're talking about. There are "free" transfer services that collect profit through advertising and business facing fees - but there are huge restrictions on who can send/collect and how much you are allowed to wire. None of them are international, and all of them require registration and approval. And - most importantly - all of them take several business days to complete the transfer. None of these restrictions exist in Bitcoin. You cannot compare the two. That's like saying I'm a better basketball player than Shaquille O'Neal - as long as you eliminate all the aspects of the sport except free-throw shooting.


No you can't - you're completely full of shit. List a source that allows you to perform international fund transfers between banks for 0.42% fees.

I think $1 million per coin is a lot more far-fetched than people in this community like to believe... think about it: that would require a market cap of $21 trillion dollars - larger than any single asset, commodity or economy in the history of civilization. That's **triple** the value of all the gold on Earth. The *entirety* of the US M2 money supply is currently a little over $13 Billion. Do you expect bitcoin to grow twice as large as the entire US economy within our lifetimes?
**EDIT:** For reference - in order to reach $21 trillion, the market cap of the Bitcoin economy would need to increase by an average of $1 million per day for the next **60 YEARS**
I think Bitcoin could achieve complete utility (be useful for everything we would ever need it to be) at a significantly lower market cap. I can't even really think of a justification for it going over $100k - unless you're just talking about a significant decrease in the value of the dollar.

His analogy fits the actual scenario much more logically than yours.
 Number of coins is a unit quantity - just like distance/position.
Coins mined every block is a rate of unit quantity per unit time - just like velocity.
Using velocity as a metaphor for the total coins in circulation does not track at all. Especially because you can perform an integration on velocity to determine a position - this falls apart in your setup but holds true in the metaphor from u/PiHasItAll.

You're coming across as a really condescending douche bag. I don't know if that's your goal, but I feel like I should at least make sure you're aware of it.


China has literally never "banned" Bitcoin, so the plethora of 'ban Bitcoin scenarios' actually lends credence to my argument, not yours. Threats of increased regulation have been around since 2013 and have had different effects on how certain businesses operate, but it has never been illegal to buy, own, trade or sell Bitcoin within the country of China. And the regulation only ever pertained to incorporated financial entities that worked directly with the PBoC.
*"In a statement Thursday, the People’s Bank of China and four other ministries and agencies announced that banks and payment companies were prohibited from dealing with the coin, but that the country's citizens and private businesses are still free to buy and sell it."*

This is absolutely not correct - at no time have Chinese exchanges fully shut down. Ever.

I'm sorry - you just have no credibility here. Your metaphor is unnecessarily clumsy: you use a rate as a metaphor for a quantity and you begin modeling a system at a derivative instead of at a basic unit. If you had any experience in systems analysis or related rates (of which you should have both, if you're actually an engineer, like I am) you would realize why that's so flawed.  
How about this: if you're using the quantity of coins as a velocity then you should be able to integrate to calculate a position... How does this fit in your system? You can't integrate the total number of coins to achieve another data point - this is how you know it is a basic quantity and not a derivable rate/flow. In the other metaphor you CAN integrate/derivate between total supply, rate, and the change in rate.
Also - not for nothing, but there is no such thing as "4 years of college engineering calculus" unless you mean that you failed and had to take each course twice. You complete the required calculus for engineering degrees by the end of sophomore year.  
All in all it is pretty clear to me that you do not have a firm grasp of modeling systems and it is very unlikely that you are actually an engineer.  
And for the record, this type of stuff:

It may be debatable but you have utterly failed to debate it. The car WAS moving at the start - from the moment the genesis block was mined there was a steady flow of coins into the circulation pool. This flow was not speeding up and would never again increase, but incrementally decrease as time goes on.
If I’m being honest - it just kinda sounds to me like you tried to make a metaphor based around a subject you don’t understand very well. I think anyone with a working knowledge of Newtonian physics and related rates would find a lot of flaws in your abstract model.

That's not actually true - although gold is highly fungible, minted coins of equal weight and quality can have vastly different values.
For example, the American Buffalo coin is worth only a little more than half as much as the American Double Eagle coin, even though they both contain exactly 1 oz of .9999 fine gold. So, through the simple process of minting coins, the fungibility of gold is easily compromised.


It's true that gold can be re-smelted, but that process is not always equally affordable. Depending on what form the gold is in, it can be significantly more expensive to melt it down and recast it - so the final product will have different costs.
Gold is a great example of something that is MOSTLY fungible - but nothing is completely fungible.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:20:58
It's not - but it is as fungible as necessary for all practical purposes. See my other reply.
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:38:56


So you're arguing that gold is ONLY fungible in its raw form? If that is the case, then so is Bitcoin. Every freshly mined (or "raw") Bitcoin is completely fungible with any other freshly mined coin.


This is just fundamentally untrue and I'm not really sure what you mean. If you go to a gold dealer for raw gold they will absolutely charge you differently based on however much THEY payed for the gold - regardless of whether they directly interacted with the manufacturer or not. If the gold that came into the shop costs more, it will cost you more to buy it. Conversely, if you try to sell them gold, they will absolutely pay you more or less for that gold depending on what form it takes. If you walk in with 1 kg in plain gold bands and I walk in with a bag full of human teeth that contain 1 kg of gold fillings, they would absolutely pay you more than me. They may charge the customers on the back end the same amount for each kg of gold, but that is only because the costs and profits are balanced out through the volume of business they do - and the price charged to those customers will be higher than the value paid to either you or me. The fact that the gold shop averages these costs out to the customer is not the same thing as saying the value of each piece they sell is identical.

1) yes - if you own and operate a platform where hateful cunts flourish you’re probably a hateful cunt. Just like if you own a bar that only serves skinheads then you’re probably also a piece of shit, whether or not you’ve actually shaved your own head  
2) yes - if Coinbase supported Gab.com and assisted with their financial processing I would consider them complicit in the hateful propaganda that is being spread and I would use what power I have in the free market to oppose them. Or at least not support them.
3) what the fuck are you talking about a “centralized world”? Coinbase is a private company and you’re saying that they should be legally forced to accept payments from and support platforms for people with which they fundamentally disagree/object? Then **YOU’RE** the one opposing free speech. The free speech of this company that has a right to serve or not serve the customers it chooses.

I completely disagree with you. Having clearly planned and announced halving events allows them to be anticipated and priced in before they occur. The fact that we all know it's coming means that those marginally profitable miners know exactly when and how their future profits will be impacted. This would be far more complex to anticipate if the block reward was constantly deflating as you describe. The system you're describing actually actually introduces infinitely **more** uncertainty to the market.

You’re talking about the exchange, itself, posting artificial (false) trades. That is not wash trading.  
Wash trading means simultaneously posting both buys and sells so that you do not actually change your portfolio holdings, but overall trade volume increases. There is no way to use that strategy to magically “create” an $85M paywall unless your account actually has $85M.

What I think is more relevant is that this is a legal precedent being set for 1 in 5 adults in the United States that says if you want to play daily fantasy sports you cannot use the US Dollar. On top of that is the fact that New York is often a legal standard bearer, meaning that legislative decisions made there are often ratified in other states across the country.

Not really, to be honest. Value transfer has a cost associated with it, regardless of the medium of transfer. Implying that this makes Bitcoin similar to fiat is nonsense.

Totally agree - I think rushing into a fee market so early in BTC's existence is sillly. The block reward, by itself, is worth nearly $30k. Miners are extremely well compensated in the current environment. The network should not be reliant on high fees, yet.
I just objected to the initial comment earlier in the thread of "Transactions cost money?? Hurr durr that's fiat!" because fees (or the lack there of) have absolutely nothing to do with why Bitcoin is a revolutionary improvement over the legacy fiat system.

Cost-free value exchange is absolutely not a 'feature' of Bitcoin - the network is literally designed to run on miner fees in the long-term. Maintaining a block chain will never be free and sending transactions on it should not be free either.
If you think that value transfers only cost money because of the fiat system and that Bitcoin will magically correct this basic economic reality, you're going to have a bad time. Transactions have a cost - this is not due to the fiat system, it is natural economic law. If something costs nothing to send, that is because sending it has no value. This is not the basis for a "Bitcoin is like fiat" argument.

You don't need fancy dice - you can just roll them on an uneven surface to negate this bias. Before rolling the dice, lay a bunch of differently sized coins flat on your table and roll the dice over them. Or take the dice outside and roll them on cobblestones or a sidewalk.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:23:54
All the costs associated with transacting in any medium. You need to obtain and store the asset. You need to travel to and from the exchange site with the asset. You need to accept the risk associated with both of the above.
These costs may seem trivial when you're talking about spending $5 - but consider a situation in which you're hoping to transact with $1 million in cash. And then consider that this exchange is taking place on a different continent than the one you live on. Then the costs associated with the three items, above, become much more significant.

As others have mentioned in this thread, the $26 value is absolutely not necessary to have this transaction successfully posted to the blockchain. In the current market, you could easily get this transaction verified at ~$2.
But, sure - if you want to avoid miner fees, then using PayPal is a great option - as long as you're okay with giving up all the features that Bitcoin **does** offer over fiat. There are tons of advantages that Bitcoin presents over the legacy system - but none of them include free transactions. That was not the intent in 2009, that is not how the market operates now, and it is not how the market will ever operate in the future.

1) Your first point relies on a logical fallacy. The presence of infinite possibilities does not inherently imply that one possibility is more or less likely.
There are nearly infinite stars in the universe. Does that make it more or less likely that the Earth will still be orbiting our sun when I wake up tomorrow? The quantity of stars has nothing to do with it, even though the Earth could conceivably orbit any of them without violating any natural law.
The fact that there are infinite possible prices has no mathematical impact on the future price.

@_date: 2017-06-15 19:36:40
Ahhh, that's better! I need constant reassurance that my username is accurate... ��
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:43:59
You're so disappointing.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:01:55
Actually, I would argue that it's significantly less lazy since it's at least an original statement. The whole "Hurr durr Bitcoin = MySpace because it hit the market first" logic has been regurgitated on these forums for literally years at this point.
Accuracy is yet to be determined, of course.
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:43:57


YOU are the one suggesting each possibility has an equal probability. I absolutely did not suggest all prices are equally probable. That is antithetical to my entire argument - hence my metaphor about the number of stars.
I think you have a flawed understanding of some fundamental statistical principles, but we know nothing about each other and are unlikely to reach an agreement on the situation. I'm also kind of busy today - so I'll just wish you luck and we can both move on.
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:02:13
I assure you that I am not.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:04:38
I agree that, if nothing else, this is at least a more complete and original metaphor than the MySpace one.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:07:54
Redog's statement is inaccurate because they put zero original thought into it and it makes no sense in context. They just heard or read it somewhere and decided to repeat it.
If Bitcoin is overtaken by another crypto (which is entirely possible) it will have absolutely nothing to do with why MySpace failed as a business. There are absolutely no similarities between the two, in any way, except that Bitcoin was the first to enter a new space. If that's the standard, then literally every revolutionary/innovative business or technology is fucked because they were the first to do it, so "Ayyy it's MySpace lmfao - just wait for FB to come along!"
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:49:09
Compared to ETH? No it isn't - it's categorically and quantifiably true.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:10:53
I'm also confused..? And if it's 'all of crypto' how can it even be a firm number? Given their nature, how can someone even be sure if they're aware of all the forms of crypto that exist?
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:38:39


Yeah - that's probably because that $5 estimate is hilariously inaccurate. Not only would Western Union never allow you to wire this amount of money, they would charge you thousands to do it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:34:56


We're not discussing an argument for why or why not Bitcoin will remain the gold standard in crypto. We're discussing why you think it's appropriate to compare it to MySpace's development arc. You have utterly failed to defend this position and continue to muddy the conversation by defending positions no one was questioning in the first place.


These are examples of the adoption hurdles for a new technology. They are not examples of why you would choose one service over another. If someone was already comfortable having a social presence on MySpace then there is no technical adoption valley between them and creating a Facebook account. MySpace vs. Facebook is not analogous to "Fax vs. Email". It is more analogous to "Pepsi vs. Coke" or "Sprint vs. Verizon". Both of which would also be extremely poor analogies for "Bitcoin vs. Ethereum (or any other crypto)" due to the immutable decentralized nature of Bitcoin.
In the end, you have not refuted my central thesis: you regurgitated a shitty metaphor simply because you have seen it somewhere else - not because it was well thought out or because you have applied any personal logic to it.
I think, perhaps, a valid replacement metaphor would be VHS vs. BetaMax. Technically speaking, most experts considered BetaMax to be the "better" technology, but VHS was able to more quickly capture a larger portion of the market, which resulted in cascading adoption. Once VHS became more popular, it also became the logical standard for distributing media, and thus successfully killed BetaMax, despite perhaps being technical "weaker". This sort of situation is a very real threat for the current state of BTC when considering competing cryptos like ETH.


This is such a classic Reddit defense. "I made a shitty argument on purpose!"
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:34:55
What makes you think it has to be the government, you condescending twat? Anyone that knows you have Bitcoin and wants it could potentially be motivated to get you give up that Bitcoin via force.
EDIT: Never mind - your comment history makes it clear that you're just another troll. My mistake for acknowledging you.

If we're considering a situation in which they are targeting citizens and demanding their BTC, then I'm picturing a hypothetical in which they know how much you control. Which, given the immutability of the block chain and the number of exchanges that follow KYC requirements, wouldn't even be that hard to determine.
But what about a different hypothetical: modern pirates decide to target people they know have bought/traded BTC. They don't care about you or about how much you necessarily have. They kidnap you and tell you that if you don't give them 5 BTC, they will kill you. You go through a fancy crypto dance to try and prove you only own a few Satoshi - they kill you and move on to another target. Or - faced with the threat of violence and/or death - you give up your super secret BTC key and hope they let you go. How would you react?
Crypto security is intended to prevent faceless theft. It is not at all useful in situations where you're faced with blackmail, ransom, extortion, or even old-school mob-style "protection" rackets. Please do not pretend like having multiple dummy wallets would ever ensure your personal safety.


This is a very dangerous sentiment. "If you have nothing to hide, why do you need privacy?"
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:57:29
The more newbies manipulated, the better the buying opportunity for you - and the faster they will learn. You can't save the market from itself. Tough love is the only love in Bitcoin.
"A fool and his money...", etc.

1) MySpace failed because it was purchased from its founders by NewsCorp (Rupert Murdoch's company) which took administrative and strategic decisions out of the hands of users/innovators and into the hands of corporate executives who failed to understand their own product. Due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, a similar outcome is literally impossible. Innovation will always be controlled by miners and users.


2) Please explain how a currency that has grown over 300% in the first half of this year, alone, indicates a "flailing community". Next, please also attempt to fit this into a metaphor which correlates Bitcoin to Myspace. Do you think MySpace was growing at a rate of over 20%/month as it approached failure?


Bitcoin is perfectly able to adapt, it's just not in any rush to change. The debate is ongoing and changes are clearly inevitable, but with a currency this valuable, caution is far more important than speed. And judging by the massive amounts of capital continuing to flow into Bitcoin (+$32 Billion of new investment in 2017, alone), the market seems to agree with a slow and steady strategy.
There is absolutely nothing of substance to imply that Bitcoin and MySpace are analogous. It's just some lazy armchair analyst bullshit that people have been spouting, ad nauseam, since Bitcoin was &lt;$300. (And, none of this even acknowledges the fact that Ethereum is FAR MORE centralized, and will be forced to deal with all of these same growing pains, but on an extremely accelerated timeline. Even if Bitcoin is MySpace, there is no reason to believe that Ethereum is Facebook.)

1) You can't use phrases like "highly improbable" unless you have data to back it up - which you don't. You have no idea how "probable" any outcome is in this market.  
2) Price does not need to stagnate in order to be the same in two months as it is today. There are literally infinite paths the price could take in the next two months that would result in an identical price.  
3) It is literally mathematically true that given a random data set, the best predictor of the next entry is simply the value of the last entry. There's a million resources which support this axiom,

***gasp*** Those credentials!! I'm sorry for doubting you, sir. If I had known how much you think about things, I wouldn't have questioned your right to share a stupid, unoriginal and inaccurate opinion.

Technically it is more likely than any other valuation. The most statistically reliable indicator of future value is current value.

Inherent contradiction.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:11:48
Right, right - definitely agree.
And my point is, if you own a Lamborghini legitimately, hiding the keys in a super sneaky place will help you if someone breaks into your home while you're away and tries to steal it - but it won't do shit for you in a "give me your Lambo or I'll take your life" type of situation.
They don't need to know your private key - they only need to be somewhat sure you have one and then apply leverage directly to you and they'll be able to bypass crypto security entirely. Your government, a foreign government, private citizens - anyone with enough motivation.
