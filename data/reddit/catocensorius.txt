"A bank is financial institution and a financial intermediary that accepts deposits and channels those deposits into lending activities, either directly by loaning or indirectly through capital markets. A bank is the connection between customers that have capital deficits and customers with capital surpluses."
Its fine by me if plotous isn't a bank, they still seem to be doing something awesome. But that said - they aren't doing banking without lending.

This seems like a really really good idea.

Interest to depositors? Presumably none...?
100% reserve banking with no lending isn't really banking, its a safe deposit box.

The issue is not lending, its borrowing. Why would I borrow in a currency where the the principal is appreciating in value? If its a long term loan (like a car loan) a decrease in the principal balance will be partially offset by an increase in the value of bitcoins and I will be paying close to the same amount in the last year (in dollars) as I would be in the first year (in dollars). Most loans don't work like that in today's banking economy for a very good reason.
To see what this would do in an extreme case read about the deflationary debt trap - 
Anyway, not saying its impossible, but the nature of bitcoin just has some interesting implications for banking with the currency.

Not saying that this won't be a viable business, just saying that its not really banking.

Thats a very interesting video. There may some day be hyper advanced bitcoin based banks doing the kind of lending he discusses but nothing there tells me that banks will be out of the picture - in fact, for the same reasons that banks exist now they will continue to exist then. Its popular to hate on banks because of their investment banking operations but commercial banking plays a key role in the economy.
Also, bitcoin would seem like a difficult currency to lend in because it is going to be inherently deflationary. It would have to have a built in declining balance based on an adjustment for expected increases in value.

Wouldn't banking in a bitcoin system be fractional reserve banking? Why not?

I agree that it isn't a serious barrier.
That said, what interest rate will you offer?
