Well, the thing they're relying on is called "Transaction ID" -- ID's in computer science simply do not change or it's not to be called id.

At least they declare the lifetime of such an id. As long as it stays the same for the entire session I'd say this is ok. You could still recognize a device based on it's MAC? I don't know too much about bluetooth.
In the blockchain, the id is meant to be *forever* so it should be consistent/immutable even if the transaction isn't yet confirmed IMO.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding you but the way I see it, we generate value by finding blocks, we're not spending it, the energy prices aren't coupled to the btc price in any way.
Have a look at the lower end of this page: 
At 170kUSD per 24hrs 'we' spend 365*170k = 62MUSD for electricity per year for mining. With the asics, efficiency will rise so I'd expect the hashrate to go up while electricity consumption would remain at the current level and I hope this trend will continue as asics should become more affordable and more widespread, until the next generation of mining hardware arrives.
Now we mine 1 Block that generates 25BTC (plus fees) roughly every 10mins, thats 144 per day and 52k per year, at the current price of 260$ per BTC this equals about 340MUSD.
So noone is spending money to secure the currency, those who help actually make a profit, at least at the moment.
Once all money has been generated, the only reward miners will have are the fees. It will be interesting to see if and how this balances out. Because if mining isn't profitable anymore, many will stop I would guess. Or the network could enfore minimal fees to ensure it's at least self-sufficient and everything keeps running.

I've been pondering that  before too and came to the same conclusion. 
However, if there were a bug or a deliberate change, the network could accept *any* (random or specific) block reward - it's just a question of consensus within the network.

True but I wouldn't choose this as one of my battles. My stance would be this is just an exchange and [let the banks deal with money laundering, they're really good at this]( ;)
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:14:44
I don't see why a currency needs to have a subunit. The [SI prefixes]( will do just fine. A Dollar's Cent just means it's a 1/100th. So once Bitcoins have taken over we'll just be talking about cents, millis, nanos or cBTC, mBTC, nBTC and so on...
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:17:56
Sorry I think I didn't read your question completely.
So where do the dollars go when I buy some BTC? To the person(s) who placed the ask in the system. MTGox just enables people to exchange A for B. What the other guy does with the money, who knows? And if you want to exchange back to dollars then we play the same game again you're just on the other side of the table. And it's true that "it's not a given that the dollars will be there" and that would just be low demand.
But I'd still cash out by spending the coins for goods and services. Adoption rate is raising and I see no reason why merchants would stop accepting bitcoins. I wouldn't feed my coins back into a banking system where some bank or government could at any time decide to disown you. If your money's in the bank you're at their mercy. If the money is in bitcoin, you're at the mercy of the bitcoin system functioning, and securing your wallet(s) properly. What happened in Cyprus will be the model for many other countries. I'd put my wealth into hard assets, not paper. And if you must put (some of) it into bits and bytes then only in those that are cryptographically secured.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:10:27
From what I understand the system probably works like that: You do 'something', mtgox queues it and there's some component processing the queue.
Now if you'd add an order that would be queued and at the current lag would take ~~16~~17mins to be processed. If you send a cancel for that order a few seconds later you'll still have to wait and the order will be open on the market for these few seconds.
Better think twice before making orders - and don't trade with lag that high.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:22:16
[I disagree]( - Have you tried it yourself?
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:35:45

@_date: 2013-04-09 17:15:45
Well there are already a lot of [Bug Bounties]( out there. Maybe we should ask them what their process is.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:13:54
I don't think so. I just tried it with a large partially funded order and it didn't show up on any of the graphs I checked. Try it yourself.
@_date: 2013-05-06 06:27:07
[In case you're curious how much it was](
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:59:11


mtgox has limit and market orders. You're probably thinking of stop-limit or stop-loss orders, they don't have these.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:35:30
I certainly hope so. In the current environment, going short could easily lead to a [major bloodbath]( for the shorties.
And as I type this we pass ~~217$~~ 218$
@_date: 2013-05-08 19:17:52
Right. But couldn't someone create a fork at some point, spend and do whatever he wants in a private net with a significantly lower difficulty and then release that entire chain to the public at once, superseeding the 'real' one?
After all, the only measure to decide which block is the head seems to be the total length of the block chain and I know of no rules where the network rejects forks that are older than say HEAD-3 blocks or something like that.

@_date: 2013-04-11 13:56:57
Well if you knew the high/low upfront you could place limit orders but you won't be able to take advantage of the spread while it's there because when you see that on any mtgox chart out there, that data is several minutes old already - famous mtgox lag.

The dollar collapse itself will be the least of our problems. But what it's going to bring with it will be terrible. A few things for your consideration:
* [The Collapse of The American Dream Explained in Animation](
* [The Terrifying Future of The United States](
* [Depopulation Plans In America: Agenda 21 &amp; FEMA Camps 2013](
* [The Road to World War 3](
* [World War 3 Has Already Begun](
I'm usually sceptic about all these "conspiracy theories" but given what happened in the last decades and what we're witnessing every day I tend to believe these scenarios to be very likely unless we take action. 
Draw your own conclusions. Educate your friends and family and most importantly everyone you know in the military and police force.

I'm glad someone [picked up on this]( If I had the time, I'd love to build an exchange for BTC because these are exciting times and we need infrastructure. On the other hand, dealing with banks really isn't that tempting.
LMAX matching works on a single thread and lag would probably be nonexistent unless you'd screw up the networking around it. In a true Bitcoin spirit, the exchange should be distributed/federated just like the rest of the network is but I have yet to come up with a good idea how to achieve this.
I'm brainstorming for a bit:
Distribution could be achieved on several levels. The core engine must be protected so you'd probably run a bunch of front-end gui/api servers as a 1st tier that feed to a 2nd tier which would work as concentrators and from there into the matching engine. Yes this would introduce some network latency but it protects the engine and makes a DDOS harder. This kind of distribution is necessary for each exchange.
After that we'd have to run several exchanges, those would be distinct legal entities, everything completely separate except that they are connected to the other exchanges. One could allow to trade on any exchange from any exchange or simply display the current market data for every other exchange. For this, we'd need to have some protocol for the exchanges to communicate with each other.
Now if we take something like the LMAX Disruptor, build a turn-key BTC exchange, anyone could run an exchange. To be accepted into the network of exchanges there would have to be a few conditions like:
* the operator must have enough liquidity so users can cash out at any time
* he must be a legal entity
* ... whatever, I can't think of more but I'm sure there's a long list we can come up with that would help ensure trust into the system and bring stability to bitcoin
If anyone's interested, I'm happy to discuss this and I'd like to know your thoughts.

While I understand it and it should have been like this from the beginning, changing this now is stupid.
Unfunded orders won't appear in the order book anyway (so no walls without substance). I have dozens of unfunded bids but those will enter the market once some of my asks get filled - I like the convenience of that.
