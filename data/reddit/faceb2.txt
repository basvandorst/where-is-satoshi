People do not know how to express this, I came happy because of the issue that the bitcoin was rebounding again, now it turns out that a new warning came out that both the BTC client and the BTU share a same fault, besides being able to do a Dos or DDOS , To the nodes and those things, it is also possible to include code in the to be then executed in each client, so they told the project BTC and BTU are at the moment solving those Bugs, hopefully soon is already being mistreated our beloved coin.
