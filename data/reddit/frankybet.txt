"bank vault" and "safe"???
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:38:00
People didn't believe in bitcoin at 2012, same people were scared enough and they didn't put a single dollar in it till 2017. Last year the same people were told by their favourite TV news guy that Bitcoin is headed to $20,000. And those people chose to invest. And Yesterday the very same people were those who sold their BTC and those who used the words like "bubble", "scam", "fraud", "melt down" and "warren buffet said"...

I'm very disappointed that without any REAL reason there's a dip like that. Or maybe I don't search the Reason where I have to... and please don't tell me that this is because S. Korea will Tax Crypto Exchanges. So, 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:34:22
how exactly did they calculate Bitcoin price?
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:43:21
what about kucoin? and the phone app coinomi?

try to use transaction accelerator of btc.com 
Fee - between $50 - $70
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:59:10
In general terms, you're right - there are more stolen bitcoin wallets than bank vaults.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:41:17
I've tried with many free transaction accelerators, but it didn't work out... 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:25:52
just wait or use transaction accelerator if it's urgent.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:17:46
if it goes to 1K, I will donate my BTC :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:28:39
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:24:48
agree with that. It's like gold, not like a currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:40:18
with blockchain wallet you can customize your fees and transfer instantly to other blockchain wallet users. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:41:50
I doubt that the free one will work properly...
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:57:35
coin.space - it can't be more *simple*
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:55:02
no, you're in the right place at the right time!
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:33:28
total scam
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:51:46
the fee has just increased...

- 2016 : paying $52 for a $5000 bank transaction (that was me before bitcoin).
- 2017 : paying $3 for $5000 using bitcoin and sent to the same guy 
 is how it works!!!

"7 out of 10 mondays BTC is dropping." It seems like a surebet:)
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:05:53
try the transaction accelerator at btc.com, if you sent a lot and don't want to wait you will probably pay $60 to clear your transaction. Yes, I know it's too much, but when you're in a bit of a rush - that's the perfect option. I've already tried it couple of times and it worked. Still, $60 for a single transaction - too much I think.

@_date: 2018-01-22 10:19:12
I think the real question is why do people sell at 11750, when the price will be above 20 000 anytime soon???
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:54:34
Some of you were very close and it'll be unfair if I give you a lot of hints here. If there is no solution until the end of October - I'll give you the last hint which will definitely solve that cipher game. 
one more time : some of you guys were very close...
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:47:33
the 6th word is ESCAPE
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:06:57
Thanks for your interest. It's too early for hints and  it won't be fair for those who are close to the answer. But you're right, sooner or later we must give a hint and we will:)

Have you watched Rain Man?

Today the first hint will be posted on the site.
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:16:22
It's self-contained and it's far easier than the previous one... if it's not solved after 7 days, I'll post a hint.
@_date: 2018-11-01 09:37:40
Perfectly correct, well done!!! 
Soon enough, expect our next cipher:)

what bad news??? I'm looking for more investments:) All news at every crypto associated web page is FAKE! 
BTW - What do you think about Bitcore Airdrop? It seems that you can add BTX to your wallet on Sunday and take your 6% bonus(airdrop) on Monday...
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:31:47
while people are oanic selling, I'm definitely buying... 
if bitcoin price falls to $7000 - I'm gonna buy 1 BTC;
if price falls to $6000 - I'm gonna buy 2 BTC;
 if price falls to $5000 - I'm gonna buy 3 BTC; double up till $1000; if price falls under $1000, I'm gonna sell everything I have and buy BTC
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:17:56
hahaha, nice!
