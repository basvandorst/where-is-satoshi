A couple of my favorite Tuur Quotes:
“[With Bitcoin], I can give [the bitcoin exchange] Mexican pesos, and two hours later, I can cash it out in China for Chinese yuan.  This is happening today.”
“Somewhere in the next two years, there is going to be a panic, and bitcoin is going to benefit from that.”

Will be hard to tell if its VEF going down, or BTC going up :)

Erik - thanks for again for giving eloquence to the nagging thought many of us constantly have in the back of our minds.  Please keep it up.

With the Coinapult system currently, only P2P that you set up yourself.  We are working on building out alternatives.

Hi Pandarr, one difference is speed.  With Locks you can get the current market rate, and Lock instantly (we wait 2 confirmations before crediting account, but price is already set).  When you want to 'buy back into bitcoin' just Unlock.  It is instant, and sent to your Coinapult wallet, or your bitcoin address of your choice.

In regards to the rates used, we are looking at bitcoin prices at all major exchanges, including our internal order book, and setting our index price based on that information.  
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:20:52
There are no fees charged.  You will see a spread, of course, which is 1-2% from our index price.

just send the command "rate"  - it will respond with current Coinapult bid and ask price

I'm sorry to hear that we didn't perform up to reasonable standards.  Since your indecent, we have put a lot of investment into improving the stability of the system, as well as consistency of customer service.  Unfortunately with SMS, one of the larger problems we face is that SMS messages don't consistently get processed by the different telecom partners involved.  We are working on ways to overcome this fact.

Hey Everyone,
Justin here - I work at Coinapult.  I apologize if you had a bad experience with us.  If you send an email to support I will work to make it right.  We've made a lot of improvements over the past few months.

We at Coinapult love bitcoin, and understand the advantages of the pure bitcoin model, and don't mean to dilute.  Among other uses, we are attempting to introduce a service that will allow users put off by certain aspects of it (the price swings).  We are hoping to offer a choice.

Currently this only works for Locks supported currencies, (usd, GBP, EUR, gold, silver) more in development.

You need a license to use the word BITCOIN.  Lawsky-faire

We have listened to our attorneys and done as they ask :)
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:08:34
you are unable to sense the sarcasm?

Hi jmw74, with 60 seconds to explain the benefits of Locks, there are a few details we could have been more precise on.  Obviously life includes risk, and we certainly aren't trying to subvert that fact with our marketing or service.  
@_date: 2014-12-25 00:22:48
thank you!
@_date: 2014-07-29 03:44:01
Justin from Coinapult here!  Within seconds or minutes of a typical Locks transaction, we are fully hedged.  The company does not expose itself to volatility issues, and so can guarantee we have the proper funds to operate, with 100+% reserves at all times.

Still waiting for mine...

Coinapult has 6 technical developers on staff at the moment.

Sadly, the US is blocked.

Just like they do in the porn industry, just wait until they are 18, and hit them up again :)

Fair, but the president's intention was to ban muslims, his conversations with Rudy were made public.

I would also buy!

How many immigrants from these 7 countries perpetrated terrorist acts in the US?

Do they never separate?
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:12:23
Would you recommend legislation be written to ban this practice for bitcoin?  
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:13:17
That has usually held to be the better investment strategy throughout bitcoin's time - unless you get early preferential mining rig access.  
@_date: 2016-07-12 00:15:15
The wait is usually the time it takes for your bitcoin to confirm... sometimes fast, sometimes slow.
