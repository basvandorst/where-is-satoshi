1. *Too slow* for practical, world-wide usage.

2. High fees
Pretty explanatory. Transfer some BTC to a different exchange or send some to a friend and note the fee. Last time I transferred BTC the fee was 30% of the amount I was transferring... that’s more than a wire transfer. 
3. No privacy

I agree with a comment from that tweet, "If people can't figure out the difference then they shouldn't be getting into crypto." That's all there is to it. He's a manipulative man with a marketing strategy aimed at the uninformed casuals. All we can do is spread awareness

Seeing it slowly dip down to 5500ish was a great feeling and I thought "better late than never". Whether it drops soon or not, there is no denying that it will be huge in the coming time. When it hits 10,000 i will thank my past self (present me rn) for getting in

Couldn't use coinbase (since I'm a minor) so I had to literally stand in a sketchy gas station and feed bills into a bitcoin ATM for 5 minutes haha. but I had the same feeling! Congrats man

Will do man, thanks a lot

I *bruh'd* too... but not much else i can say. 
I could've drove another 30 miles to another ATM and had .09% less of a fee, or I could've waited until my birthday to use an online exchange but risk paying even more for the coin. plus waiting the 5-10 days for my bank to confirm, when an ATM is far quicker and efficient.

They are all different depending on the operator/type. The specific ATM that I used was Genesis's and the buy fee was 7.9% (i know... ouch) while the sell fee was 5.6%. So the fee was about $450 give or take

Just sitting it there for the time being. Still very new at this lol

I wanted to be witty and reply with "on the bitcoin torso" but I get what you meant lol.
Bitcoin ATMs are all over the world, but you will most likely find them in high volume metropolitan areas. 
To see where they are located, check out [the Bitcoin ATM map]( This will show you the address, coin type, fee, max/min deposit or withdrawal, and other information.

I bought at 5500 not including the 7.9% fee (so I'll let you do the math) basically a crap load. 
They could've helped but this was also something they were completely skeptical and non-supportive about. Basically called it a dumb idea and a scam. So no, this was 100% my move with my money

Thanks comrade!

On the ATM i used, buy fee was 7.9%. So the fee was a whopping $450ish

Perfectly good question, mate. It depends on which wallet you choose to use. I happen to be using Bittrex at the moment, and there currently is not a Bittrex app for iOS. So I have to go through the website either on my phone browser or computer. However, some well-known wallets have apps so that you can access it on your phone. Coinbase and Blockchain are two of them. 
If I start to make larger investments and risk losing more money on an online wallet (like the one I'm currently using) then I'll move the majority of my coin to an offline, more secure wallet such as Electrum- which is only accessible via computer.

A crypto exchange operated by the same people who operate Coinbase. Lower fees but slightly more complex. I definitely recommend using GDAX over Coinbase, but in my position I couldn't use either :'(

Wait for a dip. BTC is on an elevator going up but will undoubtably stop/drop and continue to surprise us. Deciding when to go in is tricky, because we don't want to miss out. also consider how much it would suck to buy right now and it drop tomorrow. I say watch it very very closely and when it hits a number you are comfortable with then listen to your gut and go in

Thanks bro. Yea it made me pretty anxious but all went well! and that's awesome that they became interested. Best of luck to y'all

Thanks bro

Thanks bro! As far as Bitcoin Core goes, I really don't know much about it so I'm probably not the one to ask. But it's awesome that you bought some! it truly is going to be the future. whether you use Bitcoin Core or Electrum or whatever, just hold and wait for it to boom. Stay interested! We're just getting started :) 
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:31:58
sent it straight to my Bittrex wallet from the ATM and then to Electrum
