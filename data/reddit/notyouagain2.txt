 i'm giving you a solid and firm, no. invest what you can, a little or a lot, but not more than you can afford to lose.

yesterday, I was going thru an obscure email account that I had and noticed that I signed up for a bitcoin casino account under this email, logged in and there was 0.009 in the account. /cha-ching

we'll see a fully red board on the CCM page in a bit, but it happens all the time. up the mountain, down the mountain, up the hill, across the plateau, up the hill, down the hill, up the mountain. its all waves, just forget you bought and come back in 6 months.

mother-in-law, who is 65 and really doesn't know a thing about finance, much less anything technical in general, told my wife, two days ago, "bitcoin hit 10,000".

good riddance, it was a shit exchange from the get-go.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:42:51
misleading article anyway. the article states, current miners are OK, it just any new operators coming online. plus, if you just have a single 6-12 card hobby miner in your flat or are planning on building one, you'll be ok.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:57:55
here's the list from Dec 1, 2013
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:41:24
out of curiosity, was the wallet empty?
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:46:54
ok, you are getting a little too emotional over someone else's gripe. if you have a complaint about a miner(s), call them out instead of lumping the entire mining community into a single pot.
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:57:49
stories like this are the future "i found a safe"
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:07:15
