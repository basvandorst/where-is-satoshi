KeepKey does not have Segwit on their roadmap, preferring to add new coins as well. However, they are quickly becoming irrelevant in the hardware wallet space, due to their once yearly software updates. Trezor, Ledger, and exciting newcomer Digital Bitbox all have or are implementing Segwit by February.

Trezor T. Ledger software is not up to the task. I can't stand all those MCU firmware not genuine issues. Both have subreddits worth reading first, but ultimately both are still good choices. You might want to progress into ColdCard or the new BitBox02 too, which appear to be better choices still. It also depends on which coins you are holding, or plan to in the future. No wallet supports all coins. Ledger the most, followed by Trezor, then BitBox02, then ColdCard. BitBox02 has incredible software, secure element, the larger display, and more convenient backup.

What will you do if your Opendime becomes physically damaged? Opendime is a VERY poor product, since it can't be recovered, and isn't suitable as a choice to hold any amount of Bitcoin. What if you lose it? What if someone steals it from you? They can spend it right away! On their webpage they suggest loading it with enough bitcoin to buy a car!!!! This is the most irresponsible advertising ever. Again, Opendime is a VERY poor product. It should be improved or junked!

You pay capital gains tax where you are legally tax resident on cashing out. If you have now lived in the UK for at least 6 months, you are legally tax resident there. You pay UK capital gains tax. Your citizenship is not an issue. Where you purchased from is irrelevant. When you purchased is relevant to how much tax you owe, but not to whom you pay it (HMRC). Where you are legally tax resident is. The only exception to this is American citizens who pay on foreign earnings.

FALSE. Taxes in this situation are legally owed to your last tax-resident country, or if never tax-resident where the profits were earned. Taxes cannot be avoided, or reduced by this method. If the OP plans to move to another completely different country for the rest of his life every 5 months, he is still legally a tax-resident of the UK. The UK expects all taxes owing upon leaving the country for another. This is known as Exit Taxes. It covers those hidden away bitcoins.

They are no longer tax-resident in Portugal. They would have to return for 6 months to become tax-resident once more.
I feel you might not be understanding. They cannot simply take a trip there, cash out for you after 6 months and return. Tax-residency means they return and make a commitment to stay. Also, if ypu simply send them the bitcoins after 6 months, you owe taxes to HMRC.

The purpose of Monero is more fungibility. It can be used to launder an illicit Bitcoin into one without a tainted past.
@_date: 2018-09-10 01:51:37
What matters is where you are tax-resident. Live, work, etc. You are tax-resident in the UK, so taxes on cashing out are owed to HMRC. If you move to Portugal to live, you will become tax-resident there after 6 months. In the 7th month you can cash out. It also helps to open a Portuguese bank account upon arrival, start paying some bills, and save ALL documentation. You'll also need to document where/when your bitcoins originated.
Sending the bitcoins to a relative tax-resident in Portugal to cash out for you, for the purpose of evading capital gains, etc., is a serious offence.
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:29:20
If you do not have an audit trail to prove otherwise, the current full value of the bitcoins is taxable.
Bitcoin - Monero - Bitcoin for the purpose of evading taxes? Once again, you must provide the bank with an audit trail of your bitcoins to cash out. Yes, you might find some ways around this, but it's highly illegal, and I will not discuss it further. If you've made substantial profits, why not just pay the taxes? You, also have the option to become legally tax resident in Portugal, and avoid the taxes altogether.
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:15:21
You will need to show proof of mining the coins. Dated receipts of mining equipment purchased sufficient to mine the coins. Logins, screen grabs, purchase orders, etc. Or if you purchased your hash power on-line - as above. Otherwise, the newly laundered Bitcoin in this case is taxable at full value, or, if it cannot be tied back to you... it can be seized under the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act.
Sorry, the Government thinks of it all :-)
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:07:38
B Cashole! 
@_date: 2018-09-10 02:14:16
Then you would owe taxes to HMRC on the value you are "gifting" them. You are attempting in this case to evade taxes payable in the UK. When you attempt to cash out, you'll need supporting documentation of where and how you achieved your bitcoins. Portugal and the UK amongst others instantly share tax-residency information. Either pay all taxes in the UK, or move to Portugal with an intent to stay. After 6 months you do become legally tax-resident.
Do not try to avoid taxes. It's not worth it, and you will be caught.

The solution is to turn on passphrase support. This changes your seed from 12 words to 13 words. The 13th word is the passphrase. It is in essence a password. If your seed is stolen, it is worthless without the passphrase. I've explained this poorly here. It is clearly explained fully by trezorbor keepkey

Ledger, Keepkey, or Trezor. All proven over time as standout hardware wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:58:42
Yes, Trezor is an excellent hardware bitcoin wallet. And you do want a hardware wallet!!! The best way is to go to the Trezor website or Youtube and watch the various videos. If your eyes r bad like mine, you'll prefer a KeepKey. A hardware wallet stores your private keys, and is immune to any hacking viruses, etc. They handle all transactions for you, i essence the simplest way to store and use bitcoin. If you want piece of mind, you want a hardware wallet.
When I started out 5 years ago I used software wallets. I lost all my NXT coins on one due to hacking. I lost all my litecoins on another due to data corruption. I back up, and am really security conscious. I moved to a Ledger Nano, which was great in its day, but poor legacy support. Never again. I have a Trezor, but prefer my KeepKey. They are both similar, but I prefer the larger screen of the KeepKey. All hardware wallets generate a seed phrase at setup time. This is like a password, but more. Should you lose or damage your hardware wallet, the seed can enable you to get all your coins back. So keeping that seed safe is important!!! They also allow for passphrases which is like a password on the seed in case it is viewed by someone. Do NOT add a passphrase unless you are sure you understand them!!!
Hope this helps a bit?

Never heard of them - beware! Trezor and Ledger are both excellent choices. You couldn't go wrong with either. You should look at BitBox02 from shiftcrypto.ch as a third alternative.
@_date: 2016-11-08 02:41:00
You're the one bringing it up!!!
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:16:07
The wallet and software of the BitBox02 are both excellent. It certainly gives both Trezor and Ledger a run for the money.
Very clear, easy to use software with SegWit and bech32 support. Supports Bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and erc20 tokens. Also comes in a Bitcoin-only version. Easy backup to Micro SD, supports BIP 39, and passphrase (25th word).
Hardware is robust with large, flush display and touch sensors on both sides. Secure element and inside filled with epoxy to protect your coins. The innovate touch interface makes entering data simple and accurate. U2f support. USB-c male connector, and the box contains adapters and cables to enable you to connect to everything!

Sorry for your loss, but... scam.

Why did you not post the Ledger phone number you used - to protect our community?
Why would you not include all that, but instead post a receive address, and more than once ask for donations? You also want us to test your wallet by sending a small amount of bitcoins!!!!! Then private message.  Then send a large amount after another private message. Why all the privacy?
The only reason you want private messages... Is to keep your scam going as long as possible.
Prove me wrong, I'll apologize and donate to your favorite charity. 
Why the Palm Beach Research Group? Why do searches on Palm Beach Research Group list several bitcoin scams? Seems the wrong place to go for help. What about Coinbase? What about the police?

In Trezor after setting up an account with a passphrase, you can use it, then disable the passphrase feature. No one will be able to tell you have one. (Cross the border, whatever), re-enable the passphrase feature and use the account as before. Nothing goes missing, this is even suggested behaviour from Trezor for security.

@_date: 2019-02-19 02:38:57
Just eliminate KeepKey from your list right now. I own all three, but what's important to know is that KeepKey has ABSOLUTELY NO ONGOING DEVELOPMENT. They move at such a glacial pace, they've only partially enabled SegWit, and recently lost their CTO. Since day one they've refused to provide a public roadmap. 
Trezor for ease of use, Ledger for number of coins supported. Stick with a well-known brand like these two, that have the resources to keep up with changes in bitcoin. Both of these are good safe bets for your cryptocurrency now and long term.

@_date: 2017-11-13 16:45:20
Simply not true. Likely it will continue in waves. After BTC difficulty adjusts, they will move their significant hash power back to BTrash. With the new DDA, they are well set up to keep this up for a significant time, switching back to BTC just before each difficulty adjustment. This will fill the mempool horribly. It is time to seriously consider Proof of Stake.

It is most likely safe to order from a third-party source. Check their reviews. It is virtually impossible that the hardware wallet has been tampered with. You can use each hardware wallets support site for information on how to verify your device. As well, they have tamper proof seals on the packaging.

I basing this on being an attorney, but not a tax attorney, but I admit I don't know the particulars of this case and am not explaining well.

You are right, I am talking globally, so it does not apply everywhere. However, the law is active today, and was active in many jurisdictions years before.
He would still be liable for profit on the held coins yearly. The bigger issue, is how will Australia see this tax value moved outside of their jurisdiction with no taxes having been paid. When you move overseas you are required to pay any taxes owing (and) until you become tax resident elsewhere. Not sure when he fled Australia,  which is obviously important in calculating. But, if he did not declare them, they can be forfeit.

However, since he did not declare at the time, the retroactive filing will be on today's value of the coins. I understand what you mean by time of mining. However, he did not declare in the tax reporting year, so that defence is gone, unless he filed an extension. He is still liable for profit (or loss) reporting yearly.

Mining and untouched bitcoin is taxable almost everywhere.
In the U.S. for example:
"In the event a taxpayer has created bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies through the “mining” process, the IRS generally considers the profits taxable as self-employment."
UK - "Individuals will be liable to pay Income Tax and National Insurance contributions on cryptoassets which they receive from mining."
Australia - "Any profits you make mining bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will form part of your assessable income."
This is all expected to be paid yearly, not just on disposal of the assets.
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:46:02
Profits from mining are due yearly, not on sale of assets. That's capital gains tax. Different.

*"Even easier, support teams do not know all integrations."*
**What a glib response.** I'm the one being called out here on Reddit for your failing. And, it's not appreciated. So you’re saying it's not really worth the trouble talking to your tech support if Ledger customers have an issue? No apology? No promise to bring them up to speed? 
And, how would the support teams not know this? It’s not an uncommon question. All the integrations? **Ledger wallet and Electrum?** That sounds rare! Isn’t it more likely you’re the one out of the loop on this? If it's an uncommon question, or they are unsure, why didn't they promise to dig a little deeper, and get back to me? **Vanessa Rabesandratana specifically said no! She is the head of your Customer Support for goodness sake!** That cost me thousands of Stellar Lumens.
Your company website lists your total number of employees as 60. Probably not all in Customer Support. So, it's hard to fathom how they cannot all be well enough trained on the thousands of products you sell.
And, if you can't sign with the Chrome app, why not remove the option to do so, or put up a human-readable error message. *"Your device can only use derivation paths starting by 0'/0xb11e"* just isn't good enough. Not good enough at all.
**And, it doesn’t work on Electrum.** I've tried. And many other users on forums mention the same thing. Read your own comments here as an example:
Throughout all this, I'd like to say I honestly appreciate Ledger and the work they do. I'm not trying to start a fight. I'm just letting a fellow Redditor know Ledger is lacking. Steer clear! But, I like my Ledger Nano - it guards a lot of bitcoins well, issues notwithstanding.

Don't get me wrong. I'll lament the loss of China, and all they've brought to the crypto space. Such as the design and fabrication of the excellent mining chips I've used over the years.

Blockchain technology will grow. Bitcoin has a brighter future for us all without the influence of the chinese government.

Not likely. They have a very poor support record over the life of their products so far. For example, the Ledger Nano cannot even sign messages. It is capable,  but Ledger made the decision to spur sales of their other products.  How long before your Ledger product is orphaned?
USB obviously won't be around, but we'll have lots of notice to secure our coins with whatever technology takes its place. You'll need to move your coins at least once in that period to a new hardware device I imagine. Also, the Chrome extension they provide will likely die out too.
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:45:13
Trezor or KeepKey. I love the large screen of the KeepKey. I had thought, but not sure, that Trezor 2 keeps the same form factor. The KeepKey is as premium in the hand as you are imagining.

Changing your password was the right first step. Get yourself a yubikey or equivalent. Then no new device can access your account unless the yubikey is present. Read up on hardware 2fa using the yubikey at Google's website. After it is working for you, disable 2fa by phone and only use 2fa with gmail and yubikey. You do not need to have it with you all the time on trusted devices.

Both quite equal. KeepKey (my favorite) looks nicer and has a great useable screen. Trezor has better software support. Ledger Nano S is a bad choice. Ledger doesn't support their products long term. For example, the Ledger Nano cannot sign transactions.

I've 37 years in developing microprocessors. I had no trouble dissecting and verifying the Trezor firmware. But, what has led me to believe the Ledger to be just as secure -- I did not verify the firmware on the actual Trezor itself. So, an element of trust is required with all hardware wallets, and Ledger seems good on this.

It is easy enough to restrict the message signing to a valid wallet at a particular date in time. This would prevent the ability to vote by shuffling coins among many wallets.
Take a look at what was done in the Stellar Lumens giveaway. They easily solved the scenario you are mentioning.

@_date: 2017-09-24 14:08:09

Where's the apology? Was that it??? Seriously, thanks for just shoving this off with no explanation, no apology, no effort to improve your customer support, no offer to fix that useless obtuse error message, not responding on my email, not explaining why **you were aware in other recent posts that Ledger Nano or HW1. and Electrum can not sign messages.** Yet here you say it can. You just want to fob me off on Github so you look the hero here. So it’s still permissible for your Customer Support to give out the wrong message. Or are they giving out the right message? Who knows with such an  important person.
You’re just too important.
Too important.
Too busy.
No time.
I’m not asking you to write novels, no one is. This thread shouldn’t be such a stretch for you. So grow up! If you don’t have the time to service your customers you shouldn’t be working there. I just won’t accept the excuse that you are too busy for a customer. That's no excuse in business, or in life. I've given you a real issue, you've chosen to ignore it. You could easily have offered to have your Customer Support take over the issue. But you’ve chosen not to. You're expecting the fact that you're CTO of Ledger to mean on this forum you're just plain perfect. Probably near everyone here will believe you, and it’ll all go away. But, even so - you’ve really proved my point.
Here's another example for you where **you responded and were made aware it will not sign with Electrum:**
**I want you to look at the last message in that thread, where the customer also states that Ledger Support told him it cannot sign messages.**
Or for shear fun read the post from NABIT here where he/she was also told by Ledger it cannot be done. This thread was monitored by Ledger and they've even posted here. If it was incorrect they would have said so? Seems you know a lot more than your staff do 
Or mishax1's post here which again says **Ledger Support told him/her it cannot be done:**  Read it all.
So bullshit!
You're seriously lacking… Yet I'm the one taking a whole crapload of abuse here on Reddit. I just feel sorry for the OP who will probably be well-serviced with his HW1.

Fair question. I do own a Ledger Nano, and I honestly wonder about the closed nature of it versus open source. There is a fundamental difference in their using a secure element vs a microcontroller in a Trezor. They are certainly harsh in their criticisms of microcontrollers in hardware wallets. To me, and I honestly don't know much about this, it appears that Ledger handles the cryptographic challenge from their internal servers at connection time. How safe it that? Servers get spoofed, hacked all the time. Are they open to the same attacks used on chip and pin cards? Fair, I could also ask how safe are your coins in a Trezor, but since I can look through the code myself, I know my coins are safe. Ledger is unique in their approach, so I see it as fair question.
And, to answer your question as you deserve, I do not enjoy the rampant egotism of btchip, but I am asking my question fairly, because Ledger uses unique hardware. I've no issue with Ledger the company.

KeepKey is a poor choice for a hardware wallet. It gets updates slower than any other product out there, and is way behind in development. Several good choices out there, but I would go with BitBox02 from shiftcrypto.ch. Local client, options to run your own node and coin control, large screen, and a unique touch entry system I cant make a mistake on. KeepKey's only advantage is it's display, and that's just not enough. It's junk. P.S. I own one of every wallet.

As one example, they bungled the Stellar Lumens giveaway. You need to sign your messages to claim. The Ledger Nano cannot sign messages and puts up spurious error messages. Ledger confirms it will not sign messages, but will not fix the issue or correct the error message. However, Ledgers CTO says it can sign messages contrary to Ledger the company and many users complaining it cannot. This cost many, many customers tens of thousands in dollars of Stellar Lumens. The CTO will not acknowledge that he and the company differ on this issue, and refuses to acknowledge it or work to fix, or ensure he and his company are on the same page.

But the ICO bans are grwat news!
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:15:29
No, sidechains are a solution, a 2 MB blocksize increase is a kludge.

Trezor is open source, both software and firmware. Ledger firmware is closed source. Trezor for me!

Lets start with where are you located. Which country? Luxembourg, San Marino, Andorra,  Liechtenstein, Vatican City?
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:58:24
But it won't.

You will be further ahead by purchasing rather than mining.
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:29:47
That's the theory. But, let's get a few answers from people more in the know. Don't be in a rush. The community here is good and helpful.

Is Roger Ver lying? Were his lips moving?
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:30:10
Are you serious. I'm not suggesting you spend bitcoin to vote!!!! You could just use the message signing feature for example as shown in the Stellar Lumens giveaway. Be serious.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:09:09
So true! When I was mining in 2013, etc. I would take my bitcoins value in $$$ and times them by 10. Seems I WAS thinking small.
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:52:42
Interestingly, it doesn't say BITCOIN, so I must assume it belongs to the one and only. Surprised he/she drives a Ford.
Yes, that's it. This is Craig Wright's lambo...

You are being scammed. Do nothing until your receipt of the money by Coinbase is fully confirmed. After that, return the excess. It is unlikely it will be confirmed though, it is a known scam. They will try and pressure you to return the difference quickly. Do NOT do so.

Works great!!! Love mine.

It can't hold a candle to the Trezor T or BitBox02 for ease of use. It's only advantage is the wide range of coins it supports. Unless you need those coins - it's junk compared to more modern wallets.
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:22:08
I'd suggest opening an account with Coinbase, and withdrawing to your bank. Coinbase, like all online exchanges, are not as safe as we'd like. Certainly not for long-term storage of any funds. I do not use Coinbase myself, but I'm sure many here will reply with useful help, and other ideas.
@_date: 2019-09-13 02:27:26
Oh no, Bitcoin's falling...

This guy looks like he swallowed Roger Ver's ego.

How do I prove my bitcoin holdings after all this time??? I'd given up in despair.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:41:47
No Segwit

This is the single best honest review I have seen. Well done. Personally, I switched from Ledger to Trezor for better support when I had issues, but both are great wallet choices. I do hope you'll look into  soon too. An up and comer with lots of potential.

This is raspberry pi mining bitcoin. It will pull in less than 4 cents per month. The whole unit must cost less than $40 to assemble and ship.
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:14:59
Let's start, by asking first what country and city you reside in now?
@_date: 2016-10-22 19:12:03
Because you are an ass hole.

Still no Segwit...

It's sad to see something like this tarnishing the bitcoin brand.
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:55:48
Is it a one-time payment?
@_date: 2015-02-08 09:56:16
No, I'm afraid not. You could make a few pennies worth of bitcoin over several months using USB miners - but no more than that. All mine are gathering dust. I doubt they are even worth my time listing on eBay.

Worse case, nothing. He and his sycophant Calvin Ayre have made themselves redundant to both bitcoin and humanity.

... an anal wart on the a**hole that is Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2019-05-09 17:31:57
It is possibly Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre. They have been very publicly vocal against CZ and Binance recently. They appear to have the most to gain from such an attack... though they may lack the computer smarts to pull it off.
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:29:44
Thanks for knowing and sharing that!

KeepKey has glacial development and no full SegWit. As an owner since month one, I love the look and ease of use of the wallet, but I could never recommend it. They refuse to publish a roadmap in total disregard of their userbase, and DEVELOPMENT IS SO SLOW, IT REALLY DOES NOT EXIST. The new client requires a valid e-mail, and I really didn't want to provide one. The merger with ShapeShift has added nothing to the product. It's a gorgeous looking wallet, but so much an also-ran. The software, even the new client is horrendously outdated, new coin support is non-existent. It sucks and I own one. Look at Trezor, Ledger, Digital Bitbox, etc.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:04:53
Calvin Ayre and CSW???
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:26:10
Well goody for you.
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:53:35
Perfect answer. Although, I would say Digital Bitbox also is not bad, if it covers the coins you're interested in. Software is awesome. Stay away from KeepKey. Not full support for SegWit yet, and development proceeds slower than anything imaginable. ColdCard will only only be right for a few - does not support Altcoins.
