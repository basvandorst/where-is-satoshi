I think we may have a winner. Thank you
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:24:52
No. And to be honest by time you get everything setup and configured jaxx will have their wallet out 
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:00:49
Gemini is nys compliant?! Nice. I was having issues signing up for itbit, but bittrex works (may not be compliment, but they don't check run vpn to be safe)
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:02:03
Agreed. 
Come on pookie let's burn this mother fucker down!
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:06:03
Not sure why coinomi is on the list. Great wallet but no iOS version yet. Copay is also great and I find jaxx very useful to trade between coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:04:25
Thanks I think I'm going to try out coincap and blockfolio
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:05:05
Any plans on an iOS app?
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:11:18
They do just not ny unfortunately. Kraken would probably be my exchange of choice. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:13:42
Yup that's what I was thinking I was just hoping for a method to trade them off later tonight and possibly swap a few back if/when the price drops way down
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:42:26
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:29:54
Yeah I completely agree. I didn't move here I was born here. Could never live in the city I live in the woods in upstate ny where I can't even get internet except satellite (supposedly coming this year)
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:52:54
Appreciate the response. May be able to find something there, but I know more and more require id now and I'm a ny resident 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:13:00
Yup I looked into everyone's position before voting and called my representatives when it all was going down, but ny will always get its piece one way or another. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:23:24
Not that I've been able to find and I've searched extensively. I think our only two options are to wait for jaxx/shapeshift to add support or if you know someone who has access to kraken or another exchange trust them to handle it for you. Or steal someone's identity and get a fake passport.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:11:10
I know I loved circle too
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:23:43
I expect legal and government unregulated weed and bitcoin. It's 2017 come on now. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:06:02
For most sites yes, but not bittrex I don't remember what they need but I was able to get mine all set up. Just can't get to my bch because I can't download the entire Blockchain 
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:51:51
Localbitcoins probably
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:40:42
If so it may be the death (or change) of bitcoin in favor of something more anonymous like zcash 
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:24:15
I read somewhere there a big part of 2x is that the core devs would lose central control of apps and what not and that is a big part of the controversy. Is that accurate?
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:06:02
Ah yes your correct. Can do wire transfer or PayPal with some sellers 
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:26:29
I honestly do not know. I would think you could just copy them over. I assume it's going to run a check and download any missing. Worth a shot
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:39:30
Maybe Maine or Colorado, city life isn't for me
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:56:54
Okay thank you for the explanation on that. That's what I've been looking for. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:29:00
Yeah New York blows
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:27:52
Keep offline or in a wallet where you control the private keys if you want the new coin. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:29:06
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:34:11
This may be of some help. I believe you can depending on what state you reside in.
