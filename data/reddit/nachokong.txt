I keep far too much money on exchanges because bitcoin is nearly impossible to move around these days and I like to trade. I thank Core for that. You see, believe it or not, not all of us sit on coins and make “hodl!”memes all day with our thumbs up our asses.

I’m banned from the donald and became an anarchist shortly after the election, more precisely - when the donald bombed Syria. I finally woke up and realized that ALL presidents are selected and not elected and that democracy, in this world, is an illusion and a lie. But you may ask why would I explain this to an imbecile like yourself?  Well, I’m only hoping someone else, someone with with a higher IQ and reasonable empathy may read it and be at least slightly motivated to look into anarchy /libertarian type principals and beliefs. 
It’s sad that you have so much hatred and skepticism in your tiny cancerous heart towards complete strangers.  If the OP is lying doesn’t he have even bigger deeper issues than the loss of a kinsman?  And if he’s telling the truth what kind of miserable petulant selfish scumbag does this make you?

Will running a node get my bitcoin from A to B much faster than 6 hours to 5 days?  Will running a node reduce my fees from $18-$75 range per transaction to a few cents?  Because that’s what I’m interested in.  I think what I’ll do to solve these problems is just trade some more of my btc for bch. That is, if I can even get my btc into an exchange before I grow old waiting for the transaction to confirm.

Hindsight is always 20-20 and it’s easy to beat yourself up over missed or squandered opportunities. We all have them!  But let me give you a possible word of encouragement here. Ronnie Moas said the real miracle isn’t that bitcoin got from 1k to 10k this year. The real miracle was for bitcoin to go from 0 to $100.  Getting to 400k will be nothing. The real miracle is behind us.  Massive growth is yet ahead and will come easy. So then, there’s still a long long way to go. And plenty of opportunity. It’s still early in the game.

For everyone who’s bought bitcoin at all time highs it’s worked out gloriously.  Each and every time. Go with your instincts and invest into cryptos liberally.  I doubt you will regret it. What you will like regret is taking advice from random nervous idiots (like the OP) who likely own very little, if any, bitcoin and feel the need to regurgitate the investing for dummies mantra as if he really gives a damn about you. My advice.  Go big or go invest in intel and General Electric. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and if you follow OP advice you likely going to be buying in at 20k. Sure wait for a dip if you want. But if you plan on holding for more than a year just go for it.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:45:38
But it’s already being done better by many other Alts and forks and the first mover advantage is dissipating. 
I think a more appropriate analogy here to make would be that iPhone came out and it was revolutionary and then upgrades stopped at the 3g phone while Samsung and others were busy making new galaxy type phones each year.  Eventually, iPhone would be nothing more than a relic. And that’s where bitcoin is heading.

LN will likely be adopted even more slowly than Segwit. That is, if it’s ever ready and also real and not vaporware.   All owners of competing Alts should be showering core devs with donations. The only thing small bitcoin blocks guarantee is strong alternatives and growing alt coin market share. I think what’s most comical is the pride some here are taking in bitcoin’s sudden uselessness outside of store of value.  It’s as if Keynesian retards have commandeered bitcoin. What a shame.

Thanks again. Even if big blockers were right about a quickly soaring Bitcoin price with advent of BU )which is highly dubious) personally I'd take a much slower price rise in exchange for decentralization which considering the current state of the world, the US , the fed etc , is a priceless asset to have and shouldn't be let go of at any cost. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:48:40
Thanks for your high quality knowledgeable replies. What I don't get is that if this is so clear to someone like yourself, especially about the broken algo and code then why cant the big blockers also see this? 
And why does roger ver cry on camera, literally cry, about oppressive governments and evil big banks but then cling so ardently to BU which to the best of my knowledge only makes Bitcoin more vulnerable to governmental control?
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:00:34
Look man I'm still learning. Hence the post. And don't have the resources and space to mine but I am certainly considering running a full node and will likely do so in the near future.

"Prohibited rational balanced discussion". What a fucking joke this is. Scaling is discussed here and in r/btc ad nauseam. Most of us here are also subscribers to r/btc. This is where where r/btc gets most of their subscribers. Rational discussion does is not yelling fire in a crowded theater. The censorship complaint is a WEAK one at best.

BU will clearly lead to centralization. Centralization evils is one of the main reason Bitcoin was created imo. We lose that and we may as well let Bank of America run the blockchain.

This post is off. While fees seem substantial, so too are mining costs. Jihan has obviously bought into Roger's hype about scaling and reaping massive profits as bitcoin's price soars. It's not about the fees at all.  Roger sincerely believes that Bitcoin will gain mass adoption with a different (BU) team at the helm. But he's acting like an impatient gambler who's chasing his losses and not thinking rationally.  He wants to put the 8 year old child behind the wheel of a Cadillac and say "drive" before they are more fully developed and ready to safely drive a car. This is reckless behavior.  
I urge Roger to give the young child that is Bitcoin more time to safely and securely grow in the arms of its current parents: Core, who without a doubt love and care about Bitcoin. Ripping this child away from its nurturers right now simply because you think you know what's best for this child could be devastating to its future development. A solid foundation is still being built for the youngster that is Bitcoin and I believe more patience is required. Scaling will come. Adopting SegWit will trigger massive innovation for 2nd layer solutions and provide immediate relief.  This child will soon mature and learn enough to be on the autobahn going 140mph, safely, and smoothly. But there is no need to rush this inevitability!  It will happen with the right upbringing in the right parent's hands. 
Core has gotten us to this point safely so far.  It is irresponsible and reckless to accuse them of being in any way inadequate to continue on in the raising of Bitcoin. So far it's a beautiful and highly intelligent child and things are looking great for its future. More nurturing is required. Let's not force this child into the cold cruel hard world unprepared and expect it to be able to compete with fiat and legacy banking institutions, toe to toe. It's simply not ready for that and BU will not change this fact.  Bitcoin the child must be girded with the sufficient armor of knowledge, wisdom, and self defense it will need to take in the giants of current world order if it is to eventually supplant them. And this process must not be rushed.

I've got much more than 20k of my hard earned money thrown into a questionable thing called Bitcoin. Ever hear of it?  But to me it's not questionable, it's the future. I especially like its upside future potential and knock on wood have also seen a lot more returns over the years than with the stock market. Maybe you should check out the buttcoin forum. Just a thought. Telling this kid to donate it to charity and then go out and earn it smacks of pettiness, jealousy, and bad advice.

I would categorize myself as someone knowledgeable about Bitcoin but without an extremely firm grasp of the scaling debate. But from what I can gather I cast my vote with Core. I am a mere Bitcoin layman but the roadmap they've laid out regarding Segwit/ lightning sounds reasonable to me. 
Keeping bitcoin decentralized and supremely secure seem to be the paramount issues as far as I can tell and core seems to be doing a stellar job at the latter. My understanding is that scaling solutions are imminent but one step at a time. Buying cups of coffee with Bitcoin will happen, but for now it can wait.

Have you done a Bitcoin cash out with them?  I agree they are solid but your cashout is at the mercy of the que and limited times of day. If you cash out now but then btc drops in 3 hours dramatically right before they process you are eating that loss. Moreover, you have no real idea when they actually do the cashout or where they are getting their exchange rate from. Putting money on the site is clear and fair but not transparent enough on payouts. You are at their mercy and need to cross fingers. On my latest 10k cashout i figure I was shorted just over $80.  I'm yet to get a cashout for more than I was expecting.  Of course they can blame this $80 loss on anything from time my transaction was processed to the rates of their exchange being different than the ones I am looking at. Basically there's zero transparency and you can only hope they are playing fair.

This is interesting as I do not trade in bitsquare. I can understand your frustration. But then why not get behind segwit? My understanding that it will give 2mg blocks immediately and that should fix your issues at least for a while. In due time there will be other solutions. I'm sure people far smarter than ourselves (core) are working these things out. (And guys like me appreciate your hard work!)
Correct me if I'm wrong but your issue may point to the real issue here; greed. You are complaining about fees eating into your trading profits. I feel your pain. But only a little. I think core is less concerned with helping traders like yourself realize higher profits now in exchange for a more secure, decentralized and private future. And for these reasons I don't think many are going to shed a tear for you here. 
Most of us are not thinking, what can Bitcoin dp for me today, but rather, what will Bitcoin become and what will it do for us tomorrow?

When I'm out for drinks with a friend and bitcoin comes up i don't hit them over the head with it incessantly. I make a few salient points and tell them how it's the future, digital gold, a great hedge etc. enough to get them interested. If they seem legitimately interested they'll always ask how do they get some. I'll then have them download breadwallet or Airbitz wallet. Then I say I'm going to give you some Bitcoin now. I tell them when it's my turn to pay for the next round you pay instead and I'll reimburse you with Bitcoin right now.

I tend to agree that Bitcoin will need easier on off ramps but I feel the security is there, though admittedly fairly complicated. The problem is that in the US there is no pain. And the crooked government provides FDIC insurance to banks of all sizes which makes banking a thoughtless endeavor for all its customers and gives that much desired security blanket. Personal responsibility is something few Americans can comprehend. They want their asses wiped by the government.  
I think that Mass adoption will only come after a total global monetary crisis followed by a global currency reset in which the dollar is replaced.  It's happening. For many it will be too late to profit much from Bitcoin as the dollar spirals down in value but at least they will be woke. 
Only once people realize what criminals run the banks and government will people assume responsibility for themselves in much better alternatives such as Bitcoin and precious metals.  
The world is starting to realize it already. But the USA citizenry will be late to the party since they are so completely dumbed down by the fake new propaganda arm of the corrupt government; mainstream media. 
When I speak of Bitcoin to friends I stress 2 things. 1.  The fact that they will now be their own bank and need their own vaults and that no one is looking out after their bitcoins but themselves.  2. That they need to dive in and educate themselves. I point to Andreas Antonopolous mainly. Anyone not willing to watch a few YouTube videos and read up about Bitcoin have no business being in it.

The US nanny state government controlled by the lobbyists who shove the most steak in their mouths are missing out big time on tax collecting opportunities.  The fact that we can't even play poker online is a fucking joke. But Bitcoin to the rescue. It solves the payment processing issues almost perfectly.  I've also found that rather than cash out my winnings I let more of it sit in my Bitcoin wallet thus turning me into more of a saver in something other than fiat. Our government is run by fucking imbeciles. 
One criticism I have of some online offshore books is that some of them when you do a cash out will take up to a day to process a transaction. You don't lock in your cashout price. So, for example with bookmaker.eu if you request a cashout at 1pm and they don't get to it by 5pm you could be waiting til the next morning.  With bookmaker.eu you have no idea what you will actually get. They also will not tell you what exchanges they use. I've always gotten a bit less than I expected. There are no fees, And I can't claim to know that they are doing shady things BUT the time delay in processing can lead to all sorts of fuckery.  5dimes is a bit better with this and faster.  
I would love to hear some other suggestions for clear timely payouts in which I wouldn't have to be at the mercy of the btc market fluctuations and possible graft by the sports book.

You do but the point is to not trust coinbase implicitly with YOUR Bitcoin.  The fact is you don't know exactly what they are doing to secure your Bitcoin. Exchanges are also big juicy targets for the best hackers.  While cliche, remember that with Bitcoin you are your own bank. So act like it.

He was searching for a market which wouldn't exist no matter what the block size was or no matter how fast a coffee transaction was processed. Bitcoin is amazing for citizens less stable economies but people need the knowledge to get onboard before their currencies collapse.

Here they will find not only marketing but education, which is essential for Bitcoin imo. 
Sure you can run TV commercials and radio and internet ads and that certainly wouldn't hurt. But who would pay for it? 
Also, Ever notice how you don't truly see a vacuum ad until you are looking to buy a new vacuum?  Then all of a sudden all you see are Dyson ads everywhere?  The reason you see this is because you have a need or pain. Bitcoin ads run now would only fall on deaf ears in the USA do to easy credit, stable banking, cheap and available goods and services.

This Reddit community sub is far too small to have the implied power that you are giving it. Sure, there are a lot of enthusiastic bitcoiners here yelling to the moon. It's all in good fun and optimistic hope. But to imply that the 12-14 billion dollar market is being manipulated by such statements is foolish. The fact is that despite being written off as dead countless times and receiving tons of negative mainstream press Bitcoin still keeps faithfully chugging along while growing it's user base.

Look at the bright side: many people here don't even own a full Bitcoin. Just 21 of them puts you in elite company. You still have 200 and a drawer full of Alts which still may rise in value. Good you didn't sell you're in too deep imo.  And if you can welcome laughter at yourself for squandering 1.6 million dollars worth of btc on shitcoins then chances are you you can afford a great therapist to help you get over it. 
Trading is like playing poker. You aren't creating value just moving the money around the table. The best players win in the long run but even terrible players get lucky sometimes and win a few hands. You're lunch was eaten by people better at trading than you. You're error seems to be not taking the trading seriously enough to put time into learning how to play the game. Beginners luck is the deathnell for many gamblers but if you apply yourself even an average IQ person can learn to count cards. Whether you have the stomach for the volatility is another story completely. 
I wish you luck with those Alts. Bitcoin should cool off and you'll see the rising tide lift your alt boats stuck in the mire.

Good points. I think you demonstrate indirectly some great opportunities for the unbanked people out there which I hear are many. I have bought things with Bitcoin online and it's so freaking easy.  Actually blows credit cards and all the info you need to input out of the water. There's also something liberating about having privacy to your purchases. Why can't this be between you and the company you are buying from?  Instead CC companies use us incessantly for data.

What if someone worse than socialist Bernie sanders becomes POTUS and takes that 401k and gives 90% of it to immigrants from Mexico?  If you think it can't happen you aren't paying attention. 
If anything is clear right now, demonstrated by the last 25 years. it's that US government and the elites who pull the strings can not be trusted. Placing your trust in these fools and their highly corrupt banking system and retirement vehicles is, imho, perhaps the most reckless thing one can do with their hard earned savings. I wouldn't walk away from a 401k. I would run. 
The writing is after all, on the wall. 
If more people had the courage and smarts to do as this OP is doing we'd all be in a much better place;  Bitcoin up and up and up and with it more innovation, uses, and true freedom from those who seek to enslave you.  OP I applaud you. And if I were you I'd ignore the common place "you're an idiot" sentiment resonating in this thread. You sir have good instinct. Very good instinct.

What you should be doing right now is buying as much as you can before mass adoption. It's coming whether your Bitcoin marketing ideals are realized or not. That is unless you own a shitload of Bitcoin, in which case I could understand your current desires. 
I'd also ask you what you've personally done to market Bitcoin?  When's the last time you gave some or exchanged some for fiat with someone? I do this with friends to introduce them to it and start the conversation. I say how about you also get the next round and I'll pay you for it in Bitcoin. They always accept and some go down the rabbit hole. Less complaining and more evangelism will help you achieve your desired end.

THE compelling use case Is discovered every time a national currency fails; Venezuela, Greece, Cyprus, Argentina etc .  Remittances are also important. Then there's that little thing called Store of Value. People who want to use Bitcoin to buy coffee in 1st world countries like the US are fools.

Bread wallet and Airbitz are both great but I advocate a hardware wallet for best security and for the underrated tangible nature of these devices; something you can hold and touch. Think of your new hardware wallet as an unbreakable safe that you can carry in your pocket.  Knowing that your keys are safe from hackers, key loggers and other nefarious intrusions into your digital world is reassuring to say the least.

The solution to the difficulty you speak of for average users is a hardware wallet like Trezor, keepkey, or ledger. Problems solved. Keep some Bitcoin in phone wallet via coinbase for example for immediate uses and keep your mother load on the hardware wallet. If you think this is difficult then you haven't used one. Everyone serious about Bitcoin with substantial holdings (relative) and also not highly technical should have a hardware wallet. Period, end of story.

Many are quickly discouraged by the Bitcoin premiums on peer to peer exchanges like localbitcoins compared to KYC exchanges like coinbase. But getting your coins cheap now on the KYC exchange will likely have a HUGE easily provable tax burden in the future especially once KYC exchanges are forced to pony up names and account info. As we know this is already happening. 
If you truly believe Bitcoin is going to the moon you should be buying your btc peer to peer and paying a small premium now for huge savings and more importantly, anonymity, later.  
Also, it's Much better to spend than exchange for fiat.

You're taking about one Bitcoin. Just buy it. Then hold it. Don't overthink it.  You probably had this same question when it was significantly lower in price. Seems like you answered your own question after all.

As a current supporter of SegWit I feel embarrassed each time I read such brainwashed man made climate change commentary as if being in the 3% should be some type of shame. I'd call being in that 3% a badge of honor - A position which would likely bankrupt any honest scientist. This also explains why the % is so low. Real scientists know man's impact on climate is negligible but it's hard to fight the tide of global fools like you who suck on the nuts of phonies like Al Gore. They also know that Einstein is a fraud and Tesla a real scientist, but I digress. You are probably a fakeX fanboy too and have posters of Elon musk on your bedroom wall. Stop using insults to make a point.

The moon is likely about 3,000 miles away. If you believe NASA went 238k miles in a tin can wrapped in aluminum foil and back so almost half million miles (LOL) with tech from almost 50 years ago (LOL) then you have some kind of faith!

Macafee is probably right on target. But in 2020 - 500k USD will probably get you cheaply made bicycle and a loaf of bread. Instead Let us remember that: 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin, or 100,000,000 satoshis. Always.

It's pretty clear that Gavin was compromised likely via CIA in effort to hinder decentralization of Bitcoin and possibly to get a beat on who satoshi is.

I use btc every week. Living on btc is not practical in the US right now and I doubt people would follow an example they don't understand. Need to start with basics and get people curious to investigate on their own and then buy coins.

Over 200k subscribers here. If half of us bought one miner with recent Bitcoin profits we could have a huge impact. Truly user driven. Does this make any sense?  If half of us bought 2 miners, well then...
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:36:58
If he thinks 200 is a lot of money he should be spending his time figuring out how to make more of it. And how exactly is Bitcoin more of a gamble than well marketed "safe" investments?  And keeping money in a bank account might just be the most foolish thing he could do.  Maybe you should tell him to put it under his pillow

I have a feeling that's exactly the amount of btc that most big blockers actually have. Makes zero sense to not want SW full steam ahead at this point. Argue big blocks later if need be, you'll have a much more receptive audience down the line if SegWit turns out to be less than advertised.

I wonder why there wasn't more of a push for this type of solution over a year ago?  Seems if there was a push for majority BTC users to buy miners, run nodes, and contribute to the health of Bitcoin - then we wouldn't be talking about a possible split chain right now. MANY of us would have stood up if the effort by the relative leaders in the space were as instructional and organized as they seem to be about UASF. Surely they saw this issue of concentrated  miner power being a serious issue even then, no?

Let's start a movement for everyone to own and operate their own miners (yes even at a loss) for the sake of decentralization and growth of Bitcoin. If 75,000 of us ran at least one miner (some would run more) then couldn't the community effectively control a lot of the hash power?
