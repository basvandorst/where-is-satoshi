It will eventually be eliminated. But by then, the bitcoin network will be worthless. Who wants to work on a network with low fees? Remeber, proof of work is a flawed concept, it needs to be replaced. I wont tell you how to do it, but im telling you that you're wrong and need to figure it out.

Mate, he almost single handedly was running the world's largest/safest/purest underground drug trade, that was relatively accessible to everyone, and used all modern techniques and security. Also, drugs are illicit, meaning much more valuable.
The man was a pioneer, and because of that he made a lot of profit.
Over time his profits would have diminished as competition increased.

There is nothing wrong with recreational drug usage and making them criminal only makes them more dangerous, and gives a massive source of revenue to organized crime.
Ross provided a clean, safe way for people all around the U.S./world to obtain good/safe drugs at affordable prices.
Literally did nothing wrong and probably saved tens of thousands of peoples live.

38. [4:19 PM] ANON so thus, i have to buy bitcoin or keep a reserve for it to buy any coin or ico
39. [4:19 PM] ANON this is the last surviving use case of bitcoin
40. [4:19 PM] ANON otherwise it isn't even a store of value at this point
41. [4:19 PM] ANON it is a store of speculation
42. [4:20 PM] ANON it is also too unstable and slow for banks to use it, although they are very interested in the blockchain since it is much faster than bank transfers, more reliable, and whatever fee even $1000 beats 30% of all your capital transferred
43. [4:20 PM] ME why do you buy Storj coin?
44. [4:20 PM] ANON thus banks use Ripple, which is centrally controlled
45. [4:20 PM] ANON this is just an example of me having to use a reserve currency to buy another altcoin
46. [4:20 PM] ANON the majority of altcoins of course do not have USD fiat transfer
47. [4:20 PM] ANON so when altcoins grow, bitcoin grows too. since people need to use it to buy the altcoin
48. [4:21 PM] ANON just like you must have us dollar for oil, even iran and china do so
49. [4:21 PM] ANON however, one altcoin is very different. Ethereum, it allows other cryptocurrencies and smart contracts to be built on it
50. [4:21 PM] ANON if you look at coin market cap, the majority of the lesser coins are actually ethereum cryptotokens
51. [4:22 PM] ANON from ICOs and stuff. these cryptotokesn can emulate any financial instrument, stocks, bonds, voting
52. [4:22 PM] ANON thus, they are automatically denominated in ethereum
53. [4:22 PM] ANON it's what you need to participate in icos. for the same reason, most exchanges also provide fiat exchange to ethereum
54. [4:23 PM] ANON so since bitcoin (and it's token substrate USDT) has been too slow to use as the reserve currency outside of an exchange, i use ethereum to transfer my value instead
55. [4:23 PM] ANON most people have the same idea too
56. [4:23 PM] ANON so if bitcoin were to fail it would not be litecoin or bitcoin cash that would take its place, but ethereum
57. [4:24 PM] ANON since bitcoin is only has that pracitcal use case of a reserve currency left, but it's not even doing a good job of that
58. [4:24 PM] ME thank god Bcash wouldnt take over, the guy who started the fork is an absolute cock
59. [4:25 PM] ANON man what has blockstream and their venture capitalists done for bitcoin either though
60. [4:25 PM] ANON lightning network as you saw is the AOL model of federation
61. [4:25 PM] ANON everyone in off chain exchanges. well not much different than things are now, but it entrenches it
62. [4:26 PM] ANON so its more likely that we will live in walled gardens where in theory you can send bitcoin and sync to the blockchain, but in practice it is just another central payment system
63. [4:27 PM] ANON in the end centralized development of decentralized networks is ineffective
64. [4:28 PM] ANON it worked for linux with the dictator for life Linus
65. [4:28 PM] ANON but here we got the bitcoin civil war with miners vs developers, and thus miners have to launch essentially coups to support the developers they choose
66. [4:28 PM] ANON and all the while people are too busy trying to pump up coins and speculate up, building advanced trading bots instead of being incentivized to help build the blockchain better
67. [4:29 PM] ANON we are in that stage where we got the internet but at 56k dial up speeds
68. [4:30 PM] ANON finally almost all exchanges are dependent on Tether.to's USDT, which  they claim to exchange 1:1 for us dollars
69. [4:30 PM] ANON this was a godsend when the Bitlicense was introduced requirng full identification for fiat exchanges, and when China banned fiat exchanging
70. [4:31 PM] ANON this way exchanges like Binance don't have to ask you for any identification info, which is a boon to chinese investors essentially laundering their money to US dollars using USDT
71. [4:31 PM] ANON obviously though the first problem is that, well who guarantees the value of USDT
72. [4:31 PM] ANON if you sign up for tether.to you will realize it
73. [4:31 PM] ANON you can't create an account
74. [4:32 PM] ANON i have an account and I can't exchange unless i have a minimum of $50000 of capital
75. [4:32 PM] ANON so where do they even get their us dollars
76. [4:32 PM] ANON all the more problematic that we see in their account they are printing $20 million every day
77. [4:33 PM] ANON they are essentially the central bank of cryptocurrency, since almost all the exchanges have given them the responsibilty of exchanging their fiat
78. [4:34 PM] ANON

Please donate to any number of the organizations fighting to end drug prohibition in the United States.
The drug war and the prison industrial complex that has been built upon it has ruined the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, and cost the lives of untold more due to violence from the cartels that prohibition props up; or cost the lives of those who have been unable to benifit from marijuana medicinal uses (such as CBD oil to resolve seizures or pain relief), and are forced to use other much more dangerous and addictive drugs.
Just to quote the most insane statistic.
In the last 30+ years our prison population has gone from 300,000, to over 1 million. With 80% of those incarcerated for simply the possession of marijuana.
This disproportionate effects the poor and minorities and rips families apart.
On top of this the taxes can be used to fund schools, and we know how desperately they need it.
Thank you so much for what you're doing, you're an amazing person.

Just had a long discussion with an old friend who I have a pretty high opinion of when it comes to programming and computers/technology, he very much believes that bitcoin is a huge bubble caused by USDT.
Take a look and decide for yourself
And tell me what you think.

Market cap =/= available bitcoins.
So many bitcoins have been lost and there are tons in stoshis vault.
