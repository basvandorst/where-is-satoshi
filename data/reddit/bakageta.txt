Technically (at least with mastercard), if you don't have the card signed, they're supposed to check your ID and force you to sign the card. If you don't sign the card, they can't accept the transaction. If you wrote "See ID" instead of signing it, they're supposed to refuse it entirely, because the card is only valid with your signature on it, and your signature obviously isn't "See ID." See pdf [here](
Similarly, if you have the card signed, I believe a merchant isn't supposed to ask for your ID, but only compare your signature to the back of the card. The merchant can get fined if there are repeated reports of not following this rule.

And that's what I get for not paying attention late at nght... :P

It also states they need to see matching ID in that case (passport, driver's license, etc) to verify the signature against.

I bought at $12. Of course, I promptly spent that on drugs... I mean, I enjoyed the drugs, but I'd much rather have my several thousand dollars now.

Sure, I still buy bitcoin with the intention of using it immediately to purchase something. That's not a bad thing. I didn't buy at $12 planning to invest and get rich, and if I had bought to invest back then I'd have sold most of it well before the first $1k peak.
Of course, seeing that 1k peak, the crash, and the recovery, I've also been buying some bitcoin to hold. I've sold small amounts to recoup what I've invested so far, and so even if bitcoin dropped to $0 tonight I'd be no worse off than if I'd never invested. But, that isn't nearly as funny to say as my other post... :P

If it makes you feel better, I was actually buying and mining btc when it was $5-7, but I was only buying to turn around and spend it on drugs online. I got my money's worth (and then some as it jumped to $13-15), and it may not have taken off as well without people actually spending coins, but I still don't like to think about the number of coins that passed through my hands.
Though, if I had invested in some to keep back then, I'd have sold them off LONG before now. I'd have probably sold enough to recover my buy-in when it broke $50, and would've liquidated after the crash from $260-ish back down to $50-ish.
