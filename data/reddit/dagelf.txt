I recently spent a lot of time in a rural area - money doesn't mean anything there because there's nothing to buy. If you're feeling lost, you should try to go and stay in a place like that... Life is a grace... every moment is a grace. All wealth and money is fake, all that matters is whether you make life better for others, on their terms, not yours. Give yourself time to mourn your brother... it will take time, a lot of time. His life was special... PS It might be tough, but go through his stuff... you might find some coins... and learn the lesson, keep your private keys safe. Still, life is more precious than any of this...

It's just a matter of time before banks use Bitcoin to hedge against each other.

It's a protocol, right? Just like bitcoin, it will take several years to gain traction. But all it will take in practice, is a Wordpress plugin, and integration to mainstream payment gateways, before it will become the de-facto protocol used by the largest price aggregators. Surely you see that?

You didn't read his comment. He says they changed the plan...

TLDR: People have been stealing from Gox exploiting their wallet implementation.
They had to stop everything to see what's going on first - it's not easy, they have to write a lot of code to figure out what happened and how to prevent it. 
Also, opportunisitic people are out to make a quick buck and will tell you whatever you'll believe so they can get their way.

It depends on everything else! Will the Dollar still be useful? Likely. But it will devalue slowly over time. So will every other currency, as central banks just print more and more in order to lubricate their economies. So, in some years' time, XBT might be worth $1000, but you will only be able to buy what you can buy today with $100. The real question is what will the buying power of 1 Bitcoin be, in 10 years. It may well be $10000. But that is only if it is used on a large enough scale... and if it is useful for that, and if something else hasn't taken it's place... all of which are likely scenarios. What are bitcoins useful for today? A little trading, a lot of speculating... they're driving an niche ASIC market... it's being used as an in-between currency on crypto currency markets... (it's finding it's way into a lot of that code - so it's pretty important for that at the moment) .... Bitcoin is stirring the pots of the worlds bureaucracies... it's making it a little cheaper to transfer funds anywhere, and to launder money. It's giving banks things to think about... it's giving fraudsters an easy way to scam people out of their money. What will it be useful for in future? I think it's more a matter of USEFUL rather than well known. It first needs to become USEFUL to the average person, THEN it will become well known. How will it become USEFUL to the average person? I don't know... Maybe a bank that actually pays you interest... and stores your money in Bitcoin. Maybe a "PAY" button in your WhatsApp or Facebook chats? One that uses Bitcoin.

I'm sure you've already gotten a few thousand addresses off some of the known MtGox addresses and bitcointalk threads and you already know... and you're just looking to link those details to actual people who you can represent, right? Or are you just getting started? If so... why not link up with the Japanese authorities?

The beauty of the world we live in, is that it's all irrelevant - what you say or wonder, what they say or wonder... perhaps not in the short term, but in the long term. All that matters is what you stand for and accomplish, and that speaks for itself.

Thanks for pointing me to that. HODL FTW!!! :-D  I know... I'm slow... I have a full time job. No ... three. four. Too many to count.

You have a point... Although bankers did more than that... They gave everyone every bond they applied for and approved it in minutes... Being able to be conned into rash decisions IS a problem with cryptocurrency... But it can be managed with multisig and time locks...

There's also the problem of when you pay $10k to a scammer, your money is gone.

Gold was a good standard and measure of economic potential in the old world. But in the age of abundance, where some people will live their whole lives in Cyberspace, Bitcoin is a good standard of measure of this new economy, being based on electricity and connectivity, don't you think?

What is an agent provocateur? (The wikipedia page is way too confusing...)
Why would someone creating something as egaliterian as Bitcoin, have click-blocking script on his website? Sometimes it's the little things...
