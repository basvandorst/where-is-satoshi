I usually find it hard to take myself seriously too. No worries. 
I have no idea what Mark did after I left, and even while I was there it was pretty hard to know for sure cause Mark didn't confirm anything or admit he was embezzling. In that case, my approach was "solve for x" when 2 + x = 5. 
About how Mt.Gox collapsed, surely only Mark really knows the answer, and it's probably a lot of things that went wrong over time.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:10:38
it could have gotten better, later... maybe. Definitely, maybe.
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:29:44
My point, as I mentioned above, was that the bitcoin sent in the "proof of solvency" wasn't in cold storage. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:09:36
Nooooooo fucking idea. I hope to read about it the same as you do. I want answers.
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:00:27
I wasn't, and as far as I know, no one else at Mt.Gox ever had access to the backend of Mt.Gox, nor the cold wallets. At my time there, only Mark had access to the Database. Which FIAT money (domestic deposits)? I'm not in jail...

cheers, thanks for the encouraging words
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:33:59
I'm surprised it's this popular, of course. It's the least I can do.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:38:33
The link is dead, unfortunately. 
I remember we used these figures to calculate Mt.Gox's expenditures over my tenure there. They were based on what Mark told us, but we weren't given the "full financials". I wasn't in charge of this unfortunately, but I did (also, unfortunately) approve it. I believe Alex (Guy-Bouchery) is the one who put it together with Mark.
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:03:32
I hadn't heard that... honestly no idea. Where did you hear that?
@_date: 2015-08-03 02:05:30
I think this is a fairly accurate summary, yes. 
I'd just like to add, that the amount we calculated would have easily been covered by Mt.Gox's profits after the price of bitcoin rose significantly. He very well may have squared up later on, and it would have been easy to.

That was after I left... it may be true.
@_date: 2015-08-02 03:17:13
There were many deposits that didn't end up in customer accounts during my tenure there. If you deposited into the wrong account, if it seemed suspicious by Mark, it simply wasn't put into the account (and I never witnessed a case where it was sent back to the customer)
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:04:53
I probably shouldn't answer this, but I just see him as a person where he defines his limits. It scared me (sometimes).  
@_date: 2015-08-03 02:28:05
I thought Mark was dipping into customer funds to cover some extravagant business expenses (some of which Mark benefited from himself). 
I never thought at that time that Mark was running anything like a Ponzi scheme, rather I thought that was a possibility a year later when my ex-employee told me there was an account owned by Mark that was buying bitcoin.
I was fired without cause, asked for 1 years salary (I expected to be negotiated down, so I started with something ridiculous), and Mark accepted my initial offer, the majority of which he wanted to cover in BTC. I took it, because I knew Mark hadn't spent any of Mt.Gox's bitcoin profits at the time.
I told the investors what I thought I knew, and that was risky because if they contacted Mark directly I probably would have lost my job. If I said say something to the community, I definitely would have lost my job. In the end, I kept the dialogue within the office and tried to get answers... and lost my job. Mark didn't have to fire me, he could have owned up or offered an explanation about the difference in spending vs. profits. He decided I was a liability (I was, but I would have rather of know the truth and helped Mark to fix it, while keeping my job).
As I've mentioned many times in the AMA, I was in a position without any real proof, and I doubt if I did anything at that time that it would have changed the outcome of Mt.Gox. It surely would have changed mine.
I hope I've been moral, and if there's anything else I could have done but didn't, I'll be the first to admit it.
 
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:22:40
I never thought it was a Ponzi scheme or that mark was doing anything illegal on the bitcoin side of things. I consider the truth, moral.

When I left Canada I was the Product Manager of Internet for Canada's largest ISP. I left for personal reasons related to my partner, and I was honestly sick of my companies "Comcast" attitude towards a tiered internet, and a metered internet (I opposed both... the same as my opposition towards Mark with Mt.Gox.) I've since just taking up teaching English to kids, and I teach English to a technology company privately. It's incredibly rewarding, and on the other side interesting. I really got fed up with feeding another agenda, so I tried to start a project that I believed in. I ran out of money, and that's cool, I'm still working on it with less finances, but ... I have to say, I'm way happier with less money and status doing what actually is important. 
Thanks again for the tip, I'll absolutely take you up on it.
@_date: 2015-08-06 10:22:16
Thank you for the information. Who seized it? (We're talking his Japanese bank account?)
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:47:33
Unfortunately, I have no idea. We could only look up the accounts by account number or username. There was no away to get a broader look.
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:09:34
I guess I have more to worry about than I believed.
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:26:25
I've forgotten most of their names. Barry Silbert was interested at one point, but we never heard from him again (I think he could tell it was amateur hour). There was an investment banker who was interested, and another (he was pretty high up at the NYSE) who wanted to help us clean up our operation so we could be introduced to investors.  
@_date: 2015-08-03 01:37:11
I doubt at all that Roger was lying, he wasn't invested in Mt.Gox and I doubt him saying that would have benefitted him personally. Something convinced him to make that statement, and he'd need to answer for himself on the matter, I don't know what he saw.
They are definitely not family, and I think Roger's relationship was the same with Mark as it is with any of the other Bitcoin moguls Roger is involved with, namely, supporting the business and support Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-01 18:55:44
You sonova
@_date: 2015-08-01 11:17:15
Good point. I signed an NDA when I left Mt.Gox as part of my resignation (I was fired for "causing shit"). I was paid severance in bitcoin, the price of which escalated enormously after I left, and if I went against that contract, I was afraid I would need to pay the current-market value of said bitcoin back to Mark. It simply wasn't worth the risk, but I left some other ominous comments in Mt.Gox threads. 
Sorry it wasn't enough. I don't regret my choice, there was writing on the wall everywhere, but I probably could have done more. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 03:53:35
No idea. All I know is that Mark recorded all of the phone conversations that happened on Mt.Gox phone system. They were stored as MP3's on an server on the office network. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:20:12
I know the time, and I know the account. I don't want to involve people who have no reason to be involved, but I can speak to that account being owned by Mt.Gox North America. I'm not sure what to make of it because there was a lot more than $50K in there at the time, and I don't know why all of it wouldn't have been withdrawn.
Hrmm... I'll sit on that.
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:38:44
Great question, I need to think about how to respond.
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:06:22
I'm here. How did you choose your username? It's fun to say.
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:01:21
That's the only reason I'm talking... Mark is all but convicted at this point.

for a long time I avoided mt.gox, eventually I gave in withdrawed my btc via mt.gox
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:43:22
If you know Mark, you'd understand it's easy for him to be lost in his own mind, and it's hard to bring him out of wherever it is he is. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:20:53
That's why he referred to himself as Alex... (maybe)
@_date: 2015-08-02 11:09:23
My point is that Mark cannot/doesn't know how to ask for help, or admit wrong. He cannot communicate with humility like most people. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:40:14
I'm not exactly doing this for my well-being... I'm glad it's popular, for sure. It means what I have to share is actually of interest. I thought now that Mark has been arrested, and... well, he's basically in jail 
(90% conviction rate), I could speak. that's about it.
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:49:00
I calculated it near bitcoins peak price, I recall it was probably around $150K a day. No idea if/how he could spend more than that. When I worked there the company was making an order of magnitude less than that. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:19:53
On it already.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:59:09
Gonna be totally honest, the thought did cross my mind. But rationally I couldn't think of how. If anyone has any insight, I'll gladly delete the thread.

I see. Again I'm baffled at how Ross would have even known who I was. Call me crazy, but is it possible these emails originated from those DHS agents, and not Ross? They knew my name, Ross wouldn't have. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:45:05
I agree. 
I moved here in October 2010, about 9 months before starting at Mt.Gox
@_date: 2015-08-04 04:40:16
1. Only my labour lawyer who said Mark fired me illegally. I don't have one at the moment. 
2. I guess that's debatable, I haven't felt comfortable applying for jobs in the same industry because of the Mt.Gox debacle. I was fired, and that's a tough position to explain when looking for a new job. Without any proof, I felt I came off as whiny and insubordinte. My name publicly has been associated with an international "drug lord', and regardless of where you stand on DPR's morality and SR, it's surely not something you want associated with your name. Sorry to speak rhetorically, but the two best pieces of advice I got in my life were "Learn to take the blame", and "learn to ask for help". I believe how Mt.Gox concluded was absolutely avoidable, and I feel it's a huge injustice to the people who lost their money as well as bitcoin itself. 
3. You've had a tonne of questions, I appreciate your interest

Yes, I think I pointed the way and they found enough evidence to arrest and convict him. That's the only reason I'm here, I'm no longer afraid. 
edit: It looks like I was overconfident. The police found stuff that I never spoke with them about, and it seems way more serious that what I suspected.

@_date: 2015-08-02 11:01:17
I lost my job because I forced Mark to explain the financial status of the company when things seemed wrong. 
I explained the situation to anyone who would listen, but I certainly would have voided my NDA, which would have meant I needed to pay back the amount of bitcoin I initially received, plus any damages to the company. Mark has excellent lawyers, I almost certainly would have lost, and that loss would have meant that I would have spent the rest of my life paying him back. Probably most people wouldn't have listened, and it would have just have been a flame war, with Mark holding the money and the lawyers.  
I'm sorry you feel that way, but I don't think I should/could have done anything differently... accept not sell the initial bitcoin I received :/
@_date: 2015-08-01 17:17:45

@_date: 2015-08-01 12:42:21
Honestly, no idea. 
I know that Mark banned any accounts blatantly linked to SR. Some people emailed that they needed to use their undeposited cash to buy things on SR. If that made it to Mark, he banned it. 
I think it was safe practice. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:38:27
I doubt it. I also doubt Mark would have let anyone know they had hit an iceburg, they would have been left to discover it on their own... when they realized were already sitting at the bottom of the ocean.  
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:20:15
Edit: Mark may have had his own (separate) bank account. I'm asking another ex-employee if I'm remembering correctly. Certainly there was only one bank account for the company, and that account was shared with Mt.Gox customer funds (while I was there).
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:12:52
I was making less before, and Japan pays *really* *really* low. E.g. when I left Mt.Gox I was presented with employment opportunities for developers. 200000yen a month... unbelievable.

Good question, I/we never found out. Again, I believe it was one of the people who warned us... as nothing extremely malicious was done. They believed reasonably in bitcoin, and just took the exchange offline for a bit... no real damage was done to bitcoin :/

He absolutely doesn't understand what people feel. Sorry if I made a mistake in explaining.
@_date: 2015-08-03 04:07:20
He was involved prior to and up to when it looked like Mark was dipping into funds. I told him what I thought was going on, and he promptly washed his hands of Mt.Gox (and advised me to do the same).
@_date: 2015-08-01 18:05:42
Depends on what you want.
Like anything, if your heart is in it, it's totally worth it. Some people hate it.. simply because they see it as a limit to what they are. 
I LOVE teaching. It gives me more benefit than any job I've ever done before (I'm been a product manage, COO(ish). Just round down to basics what you want to do. I make kids happy every day. That. is. awesome.
@_date: 2015-08-01 11:53:08
Yes, and yes, but his salary was the same as mine at that time.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:23:52
I'm sure Japanese prison won't be so kind to him, if that gives you any comfort... (certainly no pizza... Mark's dearest friend and comfort)
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:10:31
I might.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:07:28
It was a good question lol. 
You're totally on point. I'm sorry to say that many other qualified, respectful people presented themselves to Mark, recognizing the position he was in, wanting to help bitcoin, but were swiftly ignored. 
I find it utterly insane that Mark would want me to be CEO, period... but that shows his ineptitude very concisely. Again, being such a believer in bitcoin it was extremely hard to witness. *extremely*. However, although I hated it at the time, Mark's manipulation of the market surely rally many people to bitcoin. The distinction of his benefit/malignant influence on bitcoin will bother me for a long time. But to answer your question, yes, it was absolutely unreal, and everyone knew it. And yes, there was probably something to hide. No one has asked the question yet, so I haven't stated it, but when I finally gathered a small group of employees to pressure Mark into answering how we spent more money than we've made, his answer was simply:
"My grandmother lives in a castle in switzerland"
That was it. That was all, we couldn't get him to explain it. He just ignored the rest of our inquiries. It. was. insane. 
Yes, my belief was he was using customer deposits to support his lifestyle (many stories there) and that of the company without audit. Again, INCREDIBLY frustrating to see something you love and believe in... in the hands of someone... such as Mark at that time. 
There were many interested investors. Once I found the discrepancy, and the missing money... I called the investors and told them about the situation. I wanted no blood on my hands, and they all left immediately.

@_date: 2015-08-03 05:48:55
Sorry I didn't answer your question sooner. The account in question was presented to Mark (for the unappropriated deposit), so there would have been the opportunity for Mark to investigate the account's purchases. Maybe he did and it was a legit account, but I can't imagine why anyone would be purchasing BTC above the market rate. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:29:32

Sorry, as far as I know, we had no mixer when I worked there. We should have... 
When I read the news, I was surprised to hear that 200,000 coins were recovered. My first thought was... of course... bullshit. How is that even fucking possible... I guess, to be more specific. I mean, even in usual terms, not knowing if my bank account has $8000 vs $2000 dollars is pretty fucking significant. 
Sorry, I dunno what to conclude but it feels like a lie, or gross ineptitude... either way it's really, very, upsetting.
@_date: 2015-08-03 11:48:19
I'm still around, and I've updated the OP. 
I've lost some confidence about my initial speculation on the willy report after hearing from other commenters. Apparently it wouldn't explain the huge price increases I thought it could have been responsible for. Until being educated I certainly believed it was possible that it was Mark, and it (the account that was reported to me) coincided with how I interpreted the willy report after it was posted. Apparently later on Mark had other people working with the bank accounts, but while I was there Mark was the only one. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:18:33
There were offers... by people respected and proven in the bitcoin industry today. I've learned from this experience, business isn't firey and amazing, but rather well rationed and methodical. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:07:51
Mark seemed to disassociate with SR while I was there. Talk of anything related to drugs wasn't even discussed, regardless of the benefit to the business. 
Also, as Mt.Gox employees we never purchased from the exchange. These were kind of unofficial, but hard-set rules.  If Mark hat the personality to deal with, or be involved with SR... I never saw it. Not while I was there.
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:54:28
Hi, thanks for thinking of me as an authority on the subject. That is clearly an insane amount of money, much more than any business could have incurred at the time, unless Mt.Gox was going for licensing, in which case it's entirely possible millions could have been allocated to that. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:11:04

My opinion, and only my opinion is that technologies don't die until they are superseded by another technology. As of now, beyond bitcoin, we have none.
Ups and downs are related to trust in a markets, bitcoin as a technology (protocol) is not going to go away. Ever. (but it will be superseded.)
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:47:42
The bitcoin I was paid wasn't worth $12M at the time. It was worth a years salary (not very much, respectively), and I confirmed it came from Mt.Gox's bitcoin profits.

Good point. So basically no one in Japan.
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:51:59
I actually wasn't involved, and I had almost forgotten about it until you reminded me. 
I believe they contacted Mark directly, and for whatever reason he didn't defer it to the rest of us. 
Sorry, I'm scratching my head to dig up why it ended the way it did. I'll reply if I do recall anything.
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:53:36

@_date: 2015-08-01 11:47:48
The first week I was hired, Mt.Gox suffered the "hack crash". Lot's of people in the bitcoin community (exchanges and otherwise) were being hacked. I had no want to make a name for myself, and I saw no reason to take the risk of supplying my name, given the circumstance, the possible future of bitcoin (at that time, it seemed it could be deemed illegal in the future) and I had no idea how good Mark security was. As it turned out, my information (Adam Turner) was leaked at a later point. 
I was surprised when the DHS knew who I was, even my employees didn't know my legal name.
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:30:58

@_date: 2015-08-01 17:53:25
Mark definitely had those moments... and those are the moments i felt were dear. It sounds .... romantic but honestly I certainly saw good sides or mark that made me believe he was... legit, but I also saw sides where he said basically "ones ability to stuff envelopes are ones ability to performing the company.
Mark is not hideous, just lost but most in the frame of reference on running a company that relies on the trust and fortitude of other people that do what he needs to get done.
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:28:38
None. All I know is before the hack crash I was warned (via email) about an SQL injection vulnerability. I notified Mark, and he ignored and/or denied them. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:12:16

I supplied another comment explaining. I knew I was in a mine field, and a hack was completely possible. I had no reason to give my name, other than to gain some celebrity in the small bitcoin community at that time... frankly, I don't care much about that.

I never got an answer to this question. I'd like to know as well, but my suspicion was he was dipping into customer deposits. As for bitcoin, at that time I don't think he was selling/using customer deposits or his own bitcoin at the time.

@_date: 2015-08-03 03:36:03
Good question. I just assumed it would be exceptionally hard to get away with, and Mark I believe was more interested in continuing to run Mt.Gox than running away with Bitcoin (something that wouldn't have had much value if he hamstrung his own exchange). 
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:01:57
an episode... at best :)

@_date: 2015-08-01 11:58:19
Ross tried to contact me? There are emails that show that? I had *no* idea. 
As far as I know, Mark never spoke of Silk Road, except in a negative light. Mark was pretty against narcotics and anarchism to begin with, he never mentioned any contact with SR, nor endorsed it. 
I was never contacted by Mark or any SR counterpart after I left Mt.Gox. 
I'd like to read those emails though if you have a link.

@_date: 2015-08-02 12:23:21
I call bullshit. There is just no way DPR knew my real name. Besides Mark himself, only the DHS knew my name (they proved this when it came up during the cross examination in Ross' trial). 
My opinion is that this was fabricated, cause I can't see how/why DPR would ever reach out to me, let alone by my real name, which he wouldn't have known.
Edit: Also, the email was sent in Sept. 2013. I had left the company and had zero contact with Mark/Mt.Gox for over a year at that time. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:22:15
I felt that too, at first. Then I remember just how unorganized he was, and how little he cared about dollars and cents.
I feel like I'm painting a one-sided picture of mark, considering he isn't here to defend himself... but really, he didn't give a shit/fuck/mountain about dollars and cents.
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:00:29
wrong ;)
@_date: 2015-08-05 13:43:50
Mark admitted to commingling at the time (though never to using customer funds). Apparently this is also part of public record after the bankruptcy proceedings.

@_date: 2015-08-01 17:11:38
Yup, I couldn't have very well been the fall guy. But... I didn't want to be. There was enough feedback and information at that time that things were not quite right. Personally.. I never want a situaition I'm not capable. In regards to taking over marks position, in my opinion, the "lowest ranking person" could have done a sufficient job.

I maybe don't remember correctly, but he had stolen credit cards or used credit cards that weren't his. 
Zero remorse. Zero Regret. :/
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:15:33
I was there, definitely. I was privy to it, as Mark was receiving a lot of pressure  for "proof of solvency". I was behind him when he VNC'd into... somewhere, used the bitcoin otc app to send the money from A-to-B, and then posted about it. 
I wish it was more interesting, but I remember that at the time what Mark had told me wasn't true. He said there were many cold-wallets, what I witnessed was 1 hot wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:50:53
It's your cake day.
@_date: 2015-08-03 01:16:10
Theres an interesting story here actually. 
We learned that bitomat.pl had deleted its users bitcoins, and we got a phone call from Bartek the owner. Mark promptly gave me the phone (he wasn't so comfortable with English at the time), I answered and introduced myself to Bartek. A moment later his wife, absolutely pissed, seemed to wrestle the phone out of his hand. She explained to me she was pregnant, her husband had just ruined the prospects of their future family (they were definitely going to have lawsuits against them), and asked if we could help.
I asked Mark if it would be possible to cover the BTC losses with Mt.Gox's profits at the time, by taking over Bitomats user base. Mark calculated that it would take maybe 3 years to break even, but we decided to do it to A)Get some positive PR for Bitcoin and Mt.Gox (Mybitcoin had recently run away with customer deposits too) and B)Acquire a business partner/bank account in Poland.
It wasn't the most sound business move, to be sure. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:02:45
He always embraced "The Mt.Gox Team" in my messages. Not sure what you mean. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:59:38
Hrmm, that's actually a really good question.
My honestly feeling is I liked Mark, as just... a geek. I'm a geek, I get other geeks. We're all wired differently but similarly and I enjoyed that about him. I think most others had the same experience, and i think it reflects in his media personality (harmless, but awkward and untrusthworthy). 
Mark had some trauma when he was younger, and I don't say that to discourage him. He explained to me he was "on the street' when he was young. I don't know if that's true (considering his grandmother "lived in a castle in switzerland") but the guy definitely had a cold... not understanding childhood. I recall one of my employees said as he was implementing a code change "I wish my teachers could see me now". I really believe he has an inferiority complex built on a lot of stuff. Sorry, just rambling now. He's not evil, just he justifies thethings he thinks need to do to preserve whatever image he has for himself :/

It's hard to speculate as to why a test-trade would have been needed.  It would be nice to have some details, but these recent allegations are an order of magnitude higher than what I thought was going on. Clearly the police were able to find much more than what I provided. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:29:57
I sold it almost immediately as I was working on my own project "OpenFarms". It was worth about a years salary at the time, and that's about how much I received after selling my severance.

I guess this is a pretty good format...?
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:33:13
I think they were caused by banking problems, that was what was reported to me at the time anyway.
The banks didn't want to deal with Mt.Gox because it wasn't licensed, and the huge amount of money going in and out of that account was more than noteworthy. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:27:00
Honestly, no idea. 
I can just provide conjecture on Marks personality. I stopped believe anything he said after a month of working there. 
I guess my tip to the Tokyo Metro Police lead them to their current hypothesis. Mark handed over everything to them (I believe), and based on what I said vs. the obvious, they were able to get better insight into what actually happened. I believe them when they say, most of the bitcoin was created in Mt.Gox, and Mark simply reported it was stolen via a hack.
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:32:24
I feel like a complete asshole, but as a guy who lost a lot more than you... I'll say, don't bet more than you can afford.
It's not justification for you losing your money due to Marks negligence... just. Do't. Do. It. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:45:34
Agreed. But all are none different than me. We all wanted to believe Mark because we believed in bitcoin, and sadly to say, he never showed much different besides he was the center of it. 
By your definition.. I backed him up. And that sucks to hear, but with the unclarity I had no idea and couldn't tell. Sorry.
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:29:06
Don't laugh, this shit gave me shivers...still does.
@_date: 2015-08-01 11:31:35
A lot of ridiculousness, and a lot of nothing. I hired the initial employees, Mark hired some devs (his friends) and not a whole lot was accomplished during my time there. Everything was walled-gardened (I think I made up a word) by Mark. I recall the dev's (and Mark) playing Oblivion, super meat boy and other games while shit was hitting the fan. I don't blame the dev's, they had no access, not even a pre-production server to help Mark with the exchange. In the truest sense of the work, Mark was a maverick, making live updates to the exchange (some went well, others didn't). All in all, I felt Mt.Gox was an RPG to Mark, as he didn't quite grasp the reality that the money being in deposited into his bank account meant more to other people than just numbers on his screen.
I gave two statements, the first was more general. I told them the story of why I was dismissed. Basically, after Mark asked me to be CEO, I tried my best at due-diligence. I asked Mark to show me the financials of the company. He wouldn't, or feigned that he would do it later, all while pressuring me to take the role. Mt.Gox's trading history was public (the fee-structure wasn't, however), so me and a couple of employees calculated on an average what Mt.Gox's profits would have been. We then looked at the expenses (eye-witness expenses only [AKA, we collaborated and make a list of things we had seen were purchased for the company] so it's not accurate, but surely less than what was actually spent), and used the trading data to calculate some averages around Mt.Gox's profits. The expenditures far exceeded every model we had for income. I confronted Mark about it, told him I couldn't take the role if he couldn't explain this gross incompetence in spending (he was also asking employees other than myself to find investors...something impossible without knowing the financial status of the company). Around the same time, we learned that Mark only had one bank account, shared with Mt.Gox's customer deposits. That was the nail in the coffin. 
There's a place in Shibuya opposite BIC Camera. If you walk down the street, it's at the intersection after Lacoste. Turn right, and go about 50 meters. It's a 3 Floor Izakaya with 180yen beers. Haven't been there in years, and the food is inflated to make up for the cheap drinks. It's loud, and full of people who want to save money. I'm sure you'll love it.

@_date: 2015-08-01 12:31:39
Oh god... this is just the tip of the iceberg...
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:33:49
I absolutely was afraid of physical violence, not by Mark though, of course. It was on the extreme end of my worries, and probably paranoid (he never showed anything remotely violent, but there is this ... detachment you get from Mark that just makes you wonder if he has any empathy at all).
I was more worried (as stated elsewhere) that it was obvious once I stated something against Mark/Mt.Gox that he was in a position to say I broke contract, and I would need to pay back the BTC I was "awarded" in my resignation. As time went on, that amount escalated and at it's peak was around $12 million. 
If that had happened, even Mark's current situation wouldn't have stopped me from needing to pay this amount back to him. It simply wasn't worth the risk... and I'm sorry for it. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:04:08
I was always under the impression Mt.Gox had full reserves at the time. The only time I suspected something was wrong (beyond Mark himself) was in April 2013 when my ex-employee contacted me to report there was an account that seemed to be buying bitcoins at a surplus rate, and it seemed to be internal to the company. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 04:45:02
At that time yes, but I heard he had given some employees more access after I had left. I was told that the contact information was leaked by a disgruntled employee who was hired after I left. I don't recall their name. The MP3's would have been kept on the same network share that had employees contact information.
@_date: 2015-08-01 11:55:47
I think gross incompetence happened, and Mark tried to cover it up. I don't believe he is outright malicious, but certainly ignorantly-malicious. 
If it's an A) or B) question, I believe he lost them, but considering other shit I've seen... I really can't be certain.
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:46:13
I haven't, could you give me a summary?
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:03:37
I think it's unlikely, but I don't know what happened up until what I saw. I'd say, probably not. He just didn't have a cold wallet. 
I can't answer your question, I just know Marks measure of confidence was based on what he could show. He often did things to show superiority/status. But then again, most people do... some would simply call it showing off. 
There was a little bit of heat from me, reflected from the customer base (maybe it was only me and one or two other employees there at the time), but surely nothing to pressure him "enough" internally.
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:23:24
Hrmm... tough. I don't think so, no. 
Mark was definitely in over his head (on both points, I completely agree0, and didn't have the logic/communicative skills to know how to ask for help. He desperately needed it, but didn't even know it. It was *incredibly* frustrating. 
I believe Mark got people to be interested who would have otherwise not paid attention, and perhaps that will have a lasting impact, as it seems people who get into bitcoin don't later change their mind about it. The massive bull run was perhaps Mark manipulating and amplifying a cycle of greed, one that he may started, but was ultimately out of his hands. 
I've always believed in bitcoin, but I think it's the underlying protocols that will make it relevant in the future, not it's "worthiness" as a currency. (-regarding a unit of value-at best, a good store of value, at worst, a new transaction protocol).
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:42:51
There was no proof, no one (mark) gave anyone access to anything directly. Everything was inferred. (Spent 900K, made x00K?) where did that come from? No answers... what can you report on that ... :/
It sucked....
@_date: 2015-08-02 15:03:39
Perhaps another employee...? I've never heard Mark referred to as Marcus, but certainly he was the only one able to delete a customers account. 
Sorry, that's really... fucking frustrating. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:15:25
To be honest, I would have told this all to the police, if they had had the questions.

I was the source on these... (exclusind the high-rise apartment). He bout a NAO for $5k in August 2011, a Makerbot a little later, and... 
Ahem, I had to talk him down from buying a Lamborghini as his first car. Respectively, the Honda civic was a modest purchase. (how to fuck could I explain a Lamborghini to 50% of the employees making under $2000 a month... it would have killed moral, even moreso
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:08:29
Mark would have felt rich and important without all money being deposited into his own account. Perhaps, most people would. Yes, money doesn't mean much to people who think they are rich... the irony here is obvious :(
@_date: 2015-08-03 00:13:32
Never heard or saw Mark partying. Can't imagine him partying either.
He lived in a nice apartment but I don't think fell into the usual trope one would expect.
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:34:03
Perhaps there was?... I certainly never saw it. All I know is that BTC was sitting there when Mark logged in. How he would have moved it from cold storage into a single wallet on a remote-desktop, I have no idea... it's possible, but I don't know how to prove it.
@_date: 2015-08-03 05:01:19
Nope, nothing. Was that the person who leaked my contact info as well, or were there separate leaks?
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:53:09
Someone brute forced Jed's account (as told to me by Mark).
I was there about 3 days before it happened, and I received 3 emails about an SQL injection vulnerability (which Mark ignored/thought unworthy). 
No idea how the person actually got access to Jed's account (if they did) but my logic says, it's probably one of the people who contacted us, and wanted to make a point.
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:04:37
Totally cool with that, I'm happy where I am hehe. (12M wouldn't be bad, but... if I knew I made it this way...)

@_date: 2015-08-01 13:49:57
Mark wanted (agreed to?) a lot of things (we worked internally and presented how to make shorting possible [a la Bitcoinica] but... in the latter Mark didn't understand, and even if he did, he lacked the will to actually make progressive changes to the service)

In late June 2011, Early August. 
I remember him telling me he was in isreal for a time, and I thought that was cool. Later he told me he was into some bad stuff in his teens, and he got into trouble (this was brought up, because at the time I was intrigued at how a 24 year old know so much about transaction processes), and he said he had defrauded some credit cards, got caught and run away to Isreal. That's when I started to obvious question his moral integrity... 
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:51:39
I was told by the police I could talk to them without any issue. 
Now that I'm thinking more clearly, I doubt mark could sue me for damages or enforce the NDA with the current state of him and Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:39:33
I trusted and trust Roger, I'm not sure what he looked at that brought him to that conclusion, but he wouldn't put his name on the line (or bitcoin for that matter) for just financial gain, is my impression.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:22:48
Thank you, I did what I felt I should, within the limits of not owing $12 million to Mt.Gox. No one knew my username at that time, but Mark did... "luckily" everyone ignored it :/

@_date: 2015-08-02 10:36:22
I think the quote accurately depicts the situation at the time. At least, I was told when I was fired that the company didn't have enough money to pay me the full severance. 
The legal costs were certainly getting out of hand, and I'd say it was directly proportional to bitcoins popularity/price gains.
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:40:27
So you're saying literally nothing changed after I left? Wow... I'm not supposed to be surprised during my own AMA! :P
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:44:35
I believe I read about the "transaction-malliablity" issue in 2014, shortly before Mt.Gox filed for bankruptcy. 
Certainly while I worked there, there was not a hint of "leaking" or missing BTC. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 03:11:42
It will disappear if I'm told by authorities it needs to.
@_date: 2015-08-03 01:27:52
I never said Mark was bad. I alleged Mark was dipping into customer deposits, he never answered directly but gave me the run around for weeks, and finally answered that his grandma lived in a castle... I was later fired. It was reasonable given what Mark had asked of me at the time (Become the CEO and find investors). 
Even without an NDA, if I would have approached authorities without any concrete proof, they would have ignored it (at worst) and at best would have inquired softly with Mark. The blowback would have been much more than I could handle financially. 
Sorry you disagree with my decisions, and I am sorry for how things turned out, but I can't feel responsible if Mark is indeed proven to be the sole reason behind Mt. Gox's collapse and the missing Bitcoin owned by his customers. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 11:50:07
Totally possible, but Mark told me not many coins were taken (I forget the figure). 
I have absolutely nothing to add on that point, because I simply don't know. It connects to the later story, but I have no idea when "hoping that future profits cover the loss" on the bitcoin side started. I only know about the cash side. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:30:35
when I made this post, posts on the actual subject were 50-100 votes... vs. some other crap posts. I say what I see :/
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:08:27
I never really had any legal legitimacy within the company, and if I did it was done internally. 
If I took the position of "CEO" for Mt.Gox, I knew I'd have to explain who I was to the community at that time. But besides that, my employment contract had my real name, everyone after that just knew my by my nickname. I didn't open any bank accounts (Mark couldn't even do that...) so I never ran into an issue. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:46:09
Sorry, I don't know who that is. Maybe it was after my time there :(
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:43:55
Mark preferred buying gadgets to buying Monkeys (NAO Robot, 3D printers). I had heard about hookers, but I never witnessed anything so that's just hearsay. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:10:35
Yes. We had multiple meetings about this... the response was laughable. 
Mark said that if he died there would be hints that one of his best friends could follow to find and unlock the cold-wallets. When I asked said friend, he said he had no idea what Mark was talking about. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 11:52:21
Gay-Bouchery was a person who worked with Mark previous to Mt.Gox. In the initial stages of the company Alex (Gay-Bouchery) was hired by me (with a little pressure from Mark) to head our PR. He held that role until I left, and he also helped with trying to find investors up until my departure. Unfortunately, I don't know what he did after I left, all I know is he was close and would back Mark on almost anything. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 03:05:41
I'm not rich, I sold my bitcoin immediately after being fired. I made no profit.

My personal anecdote is that Mark is somewhere on the autism spectrum... but when you read up about that, it doesn't quite match. He had(has) the ego of someone wanting to prove themselves, some anti-social behaviours, some social behaviours, and everything in between. He's still a mystery to me, and absolutely unpredictable. He's a mindfuck, and that's coming from someone who knows people (in my own opinion) pretty well.
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:53:05
Totally was willing to step into the fire with him, if we could find a plan to correct what was wrong. I told others about the opportunity, and when they weighed in they said that I would have just been a ... well I don't remember exactly how it was said, but it's basically described as "a puppet" (based on how things were being run at that time). I, nor anyone could have pulled Mark out of whatever he was into at the time, because he never thought he needed help.

Yes, and I was the "Chief of ICT Operations". But to be fair, Mark (in salary) was making less.

I think I mentioned in different comment threads, I had an NDA that prohibited me from talking about Mt.Gox. It's still enforceable, but I think Mark has other things to worry about at the moment... I hope :/

I would have focused on getting trust worthy, experienced stakeholders to advise and eventually take over the operation. I would have worked with those people to get the right licensing for each area Mt.Gox served it's customers in. Probably, I wouldn't have stayed in Japan due to the banking issues Mt.Gox was having (but I don't know what my strategy would have been in order to do so)

I'm no expert on the subject, and smarter people than I have looked at this (willy report). 
To conjecture with you, I don't think they went missing (stolen), but either didn't exist or were somehow lost through disorganization. I don't believe Mark has a stash somewhere, though he does continue to surprise me.
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:00:22
I think the police investigated Mark's claims first, came up empty handed, and then started to investigate what "May" have happened. I was only contacted in April by the police, and had my last interview last week. I don't know if they already found what they wanted before talking to me, and just used my statement to reinforce what they already knew, or if my statement along with others put them on the path that ended with Marks arrest. As I mentioned in another thread, they seemed surprised when I mentioned the willy report initially, I felt like they didn't know about it at that time. 
No, but this would be a lot more interesting if I did...

He VNC'd into a remote linux desktop, and accessed the wallet from there. It *wasn't* cold storage... that was what I was trying to say. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:36:54
To be honest, before you asked this question I had never considered it wasn't Mark. Perhaps it wasn't...? 
I just know my ex-employee contacted me about with the impression that Mark owned this account, I hadn't questioned it, and it was presented as "Mark is at it again" (considering all of the ridiculousness previous to my leaving the company) 
@_date: 2015-08-01 11:11:08
At that time he wanted to split Mt.Gox properties from Tibanne's, as Tibanne was registered as an IT company, it was most definitely going to lead to some problems when we applied to be a Money Service Business (I've now forgotten the actual name of this entity in Japan [Maybe PSP?]. He wanted me to be the CEO for a reason that was never explained, and my thinking at the time was that, although I was extremely unqualified, I could at least do a better job than Mark and perhaps find a more suitable long term candidate for the role. 
The paranoid part of me thinks that perhaps Mark was already manipulating the market, and perhaps wanted a fall guy in case things went south. I'll probably never know the real reason. 
The police asked me the same question, what my take was. I'll tell you the same thing I told them. In April 2013 I was contacted by one of my ex-employees. They said that a deposit went into the wrong account, when they approached Mark he refused to send it to the correct customers account. Upon further investigation, this employee saw that the account the money was deposited into was actually buying bitcoin at something above the market rate, and doing it in a timed manner. The amount (going off of memory here) was about 2000 BTC per purchase, all at a surplus. I then pointed the Tokyo Metro Police to the Willy Report, which seemed to match what was reported to me a year earlier. (At the time, the lead investigator seemed surprised and wanted to know more information about the Willy report. I gave them the URL, and I wasn't asked about it in previous questioning (I wasn't working there at the time this alleged manipulation started). 
My theory until now was that 1) Mark was driving up the price artificially, and 2) Because of his banking problems people were depositing money, selling their cash for bitcoin, and cashing out at other exchanges, exacerbating the problem (it was a "BTC-bank run) of Mt.Gox's diminished BTC reserves.
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:08:46
My echo the uncertainty of if "those chunks were actually held in proper cold storage" ... but I can tell you they were there, on a display, with zero managing done before hand. How they got there, the work that took them to be there... no ... idea. They were there, in 15 seconds of mark logging in via VNC. 
I didn't realize until we had this thread, just how big of a deal it is (I thought it was... well, not cold storage, but... people seem to be pissed about it.

@_date: 2015-08-02 10:45:19
I'm saying that I was shown an account that seemed to be automated and it was buying bitcoin at a higher-than-market price. When I saw the willy report, it seemed to match that circumstance closely.

Dear Mt.Gox Users,
It’s no secret that since Tibanne took over Mt.Gox in March 2011 we’ve had a bumpy road, both in terms of growth and security.  The violation of our exchange that took place in June has left an ominous cloud hanging over us and in part, Bitcion and the community.  It has taken us several months to reestablish the level of trust we have now, and we feel as the leading Bitcoin Exchange it is our place to continue to set the model of trust for companies whose business revolves around Bitcoin. 
Today we will be putting up a deck, aptly called “Transparency” where you will find basic information about Mt.Gox including operation cost, basic security details, revenue, turnover and so on...
A update to this document will be done every three months or so and we plan to provide as much information as possible without breaching our companies security or competitive advantage. Also, please note that this iteration is a first attempt and we plan to refine subsequent attempts in an effort to be continually more accurate and clear. Your feedback on this deck is of course welcome!
Also, we plan to have this document verified by third party auditors for future releases, however we want to set a realistic expectation this may not happen by the next quarter.
We sincerely hope that our effort here will be mirrored by other exchanges, Bitcoin related business, and that we have the communities backing on this “move”.
Transparently, 
The Mt.Gox Team.

Don't read into this too much, but we were very upfront with Dwolla and the "risks" that were involved. Consequently, we feel they've kept a watchful eye on our transactions. One would think that TradeHill would obviously fall within the realm of the same concerns... yet they were hit with this and not us (yet... *crosses fingers*). Let's hope the open letter gets a response so we hear Dwolla's side, but I always cringe at stuff like this. Maybe I'm too far into the ideological side of things, but the fact that someone would do this to a budding exchange is ... well it's extremely short sighted and obviously damaging to bitcoin, assuming they want it to succeed in the first place.

The best way right now is to send SEK as an International Wire. There are instructions on the "Add funds" page of MtGox.com. Make sure you open a wallet for the SEK and set it as your "main wallet" otherwise they will be converted to USD, which wouldn't be good.

Can you think of a better way for merchants to take payments in bitcoins? (honest question) Surely the network is too slow as it stands. Merchants can't stand around and wait for the network to confirm payments, they need to take them and move on to the next waiting customer. Perhaps Ripple is a solution for this (?), but in the mean time we're going to have to go with the "necessary evil" to enable merchants. I for one believe the price of bitcoins will drop if they don't start becoming something practical instead of theoretical. You've obviously a stakeholder in the bitcoin, so what do you propose we do to enable merchants with a POS while keeping it in the spirit of bitcoin? We're hoping to decentralize the exchange in the future - would that make this ok?

"Rat them out" -- Ok, we're not going to "Rat" anyone "out". If an authority approaches us with a warrant/PIPEDA etc. on the grounds of illegal activity, we are obligated to assist. If you think the DEA or anyone else is just going to email us and ask for info on our users/traders, and we'll just go along with it you are very mistaken. We aren't going to go all "Google" on everyone and provide an API for them to use either. So let's just put any nonsense to rest about us nonchalantly giving away the private information of our users. We fully intend to back you, provided you aren't someone who has been irresponsible enough to let authorities build a case or paper trail against you.

Our "vault" is intact. As for the hackcrash itself...to be completely frank, we don't have it pinned down. The financial auditors account was definitely compromised, and had the access we said it did. We weren't just making that up, and we know it makes-no-sense but it will... I know it's a non-answer and it's frustrating to hear, but we're going to continue to investigate until we can conclusively say what happened. Talking more now about what we *think* we know won't help anything, or gain confidence in our competency with our traders. We fully intend to give our users and the community closure when we're confident in our findings.

The DB definitely got leaked. I/we *completely* agree, and because of the downtime we may actually get time to implement some of the security our users have been asking for. Not sure if I can say this but we sent the paperwork to apply for whatever is needed to get user RSA keys last Thursday, so we've got the ball rolling to provide that as an option in the future. Are you able to legally work in Japan? It always come down to this, and we've refused a lot of qualified people oversea's due to security. Too bad it didn't save us the anything in the end.

I'm going to start out by saying (maybe because it's Monday and early in Japan before I'm even into the office but...) your account name wasn't obvious to me in this email. Again, maybe I'm tired (or just slow) but I don't see it. I'm sure I'll face palm after you tell me... 
Anyway, I'm not going to say that we've been handling the incresed security and document verifications well, we haven't and it looks a lot like we're holding you're money, but you will get it back. 
We implemented these measures to keep the exchange alive as we were facing multiple account closures due to stolen money being sent to us and a bunch of other fraudulent behaviour. What you are seeing is a gaping hole in our AML process due to our knee jerk response to this kind of activity. 
Don't take this as an excuse, it isn't. As head of our operations groups I apologize for the rediculously bad experience this has been for you and our other customers. I expect more than a handful of customers to leave us over this, and we can't really blame them... however we've done what we've had to do so we can keep our accounts (we lost our account with technocash, regardless) and protect our customers. We're realizing now how very difficult it is to protect our users while protecting ourselves. As the story goes in so many other scenarios it's always the few that mess things up for everyone.
Also, not an excuse but to help you understand, Mark had over 1K of these AML requests in his inbox and more coming in by the minute. Yes, these are because of something we implemented but historically he's been the only one handling these due to security, and the influx we received was well beyond what we thought we'd see. Marks never been regarded as a smooh talking customer service guy, which is why I was hired (not that I am either, but english is at least my native tongue) but in this instance I believe Marks answer is short mostly because he's trying to get through all of these requests asap... again, not your fault and not what you can expect from us in the future. We have a new document auditor joining us today who will be able to handle these requests exclusively. 
Please respond back to the email with something to the effect of
Usename: myaccount
And the next time we get to it we will be able to process it accordingly.
tl;dr - your email wasn't clear (to me anyway), we will give your money back (provided you clarify your account name), we shot ourselves in the foot process-wise and were trying to stay afloat, Marks "dick" response is likely because he's tryig to get through +1000 emails, we are taking this off his plate and the response times and customer service will be better by the end of the week, and we're (I'm) very sorry to put you through this. 
**Edit: We have our new process/software in place. As the queue is empty for the new process it may be faster to make submissions via  so we strongly suggest you resubmit (sorry!) via this link. Again, our *sincerest* apologies for the delays and we will review these as fast as humanly possible.**

Upon registration, user are now able to select their main currency.
**Existing Users**
If you are an existing user you can set your main currency by clicking on your username, "settings" and then by selecting a currency from the "Main currency" drop down.  
If you have more than 1 currency added to your account, you can select it by clicking the drop down in the wallets section. This is located under your username after you have logged in.
Additionally, in your account settings you can define how you want funds to be deposited into your account if they are different from your main currency. 
**When receiving funds in a currency other than my main currency**:
* convert to my main currency -&gt; If you have USD set as your main wallet and deposit JPY, we will convert it to USD automatically (for a fee of 2.5%).
* add to a wallet in that currency (if I have one) -&gt; In a situation where you have USD/JPY wallets, but have JPY set as your main wallet and you deposit USD, we will simply add the USD to your USD wallet. If you have this option selected and send in a currency you don't have a wallet for, the funds will be converted to your main currency (for a fee of 2.5%).
* create a new wallet in that currency -&gt; If you deposit in a currency that is not your main currency, a new wallet for that currency will be created.

I just did this, thanks for the suggestion.

It will be provided via our MtGoxLive android/iphone apps (as it stands today). No need for a card.
@_date: 2011-06-24 23:12:03
If your password strength was good, we should have approved it regardless. Was your password complicated too? Do you usually use different PC's to trade on Mt.Gox?

As far as we've seen the DB was copied by an account that had read-only access. We haven't seen proof of the supposed SQL injection that lead to the DB being leaked. If everyone believes this is the case, and has evidence we would *sincerely* like to see it. The passwords in the DB's are only easy to crack if an account had a weak password. "Hacked database" isn't the right way to term it. 
@_date: 2011-09-02 14:25:30
Unfortunately, we aren't currently taking SEPA transfers. We are hopeful they will be available next week but even when they are, our bank only takes Euros. We are planning to make this *much* easier in the near future however.

Sorry, I'm downvoting this. The expectation that any website (let alone one that is 3-4 weeks old) won't run into problems or have downtime is a bit unrealistic. Heck, the fact that I'm posting this on reddit and you are actually able to read it is *outstanding*. Whatever is going on over there, they are working to get it right and get it back online. Cut them some slack, and in the mean time hold some BTC in your wallet at home so you can alternate exchanges. No good investor has all their eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2011-06-20 13:42:16
Sorry, everyone. I guess it's no measure of greatness, but we seem to be doing better than Sony.
@_date: 2011-06-20 12:13:58
Doing so would be a lie. I admit, I/we are the most deserving people to be trolled right now, but there is nothing we've seen that points to an SQL inject. I don't know what else we can say...

Bitcoins intrinsic value comes from its design. Right now the only thing giving bitcoin tangible value is the ability to trade it for USD on its speculative value. Love it or hate it, the exchanges are the center of bitcoins development at the moment. We're going to have a POS system setup before long, which will allow for mercharts to accept payments as a bitcoin voucher (the can of course transfer the funds out of Mt.Gox as actual bitcoins). Once merchants are able to effectively use bitcoin, you'll see the market place grow its own legs and subsiquently we should see less of a focus on the exchanges. 
@_date: 2011-06-08 15:34:43
We're doing "okay", bitcoin is doing great. Thanks for the positive vibes though.
@_date: 2011-06-20 22:01:07
I/we have apologized, just not in this post. Sorry if it sounds like we're playing it down, I/we believe its a very, very big deal but at the same time we're trying to be clear about what we know. Many posts are "we told you so" in nature, which, yes people definitely had concerns about security that were voiced and that I raised with Mark. Obviously we never imagined *this* would be the cause of the breach. In the end it's the same result, unfortunately, I guess we just want people to know we were taking the feedback seriously from the beginning and we don't have a large pool of trustworthy people to work with to make turn around times snappy. I think this much has been proven already. Sure, it sounds like a cop out but if you were here you'd see its not for lack of trying. 
@_date: 2011-06-23 00:15:03
We understand for a lot of people this is the big piece of the puzzle. "It doesn't make sense" is a sensible statement. We are not able to talk about it further, mainly because giving any more info could give this person/company/group identity away. We know it's encredibly cryptic, and feel  free to speculate to your hearts content, however we will not be able to indulge you with any more details at this time.

Personally, I'm a huge advocate of micro-lending and it is primarily why I took an immediate and sincere interest in bitcoin. I'm ecstatic to read that you are considering bitcoin! I read Prof. Yunus' book last year and have been looking at (eventually) approaching Grameen to educate them on bitcoin. Also, I've spent many sleepless nights wrapping my head around how bitcoin micro-lending could be leveraged in developing nations. As with anywhere that bitcoin is currently being used, people are forced to extract the value of their bitcoins to buy tangible goods.... so either you are going to need a strong network of people exchanging bitcoins (and thus, internet connectivity) or you'll need trustworthy stakeholders in each community that can exchange bitcoins for a local currency. I would love to take this conversation offline, or see if there isn't some way Mt.Gox or myself can be involved. 
@_date: 2011-06-16 00:02:19
thanks, we can't wait to give Canada an easier way to get funds in/out. We apologize for the delay but happy you guys have got a solution even though it isn't our.

Well, don't tiptoe around it, send us your resume :P It's been difficult to find people to work in Japan, also people we have wanted to hire look into bitcoin and decide it's too risky. Just yesterday our new guy quit. We're honest enough during the interviews to let people know what they're getting into, and although a lot of great people want to work with us, none of them are here, which is very important.
PS: I'm not sure what my personal "integrity" and hiring people has to do with each other, just to be clear.
@_date: 2011-06-16 08:25:52
I see your point, but certainly cyristvirus comment seems to make the conversation that would actually go on more sinister and oppressive than what would happen in reality. Anyway, I personally believe there is no point in talking about "freedom" until people are willing to stop using delegates, which is ultimately giving up freedom. I suppose so long as there are decisions being made that directly affect you which you are not apart of, you are not "free". 
@_date: 2011-06-11 05:40:00
I also tend to agree, but to be fair one needs to look at the popularity bitcoin has found only recently. Mt.Gox is/was catering to a fringe market, and the sight and funcionality reflects as much. The expectations are exceedingly high for a exchange/currency that is illegitimate in the eyes of established institutions. The fact remains that until bitcoin has shown that it is not going anywhere, services like moneybookers are not willing to work with us. It is not Mt.Gox's or any other exchanges "failures" but a rather a reflection of the growing pains associated with bitcoin itself. We are trying to make this as easy as possible, but I'm afraid that the public will need to express to these services that they trust, and want to use our exchange. Help us help you, please call or email them to put a bug in their ear. I'll start a thread in asking for your suggestions.
@_date: 2011-10-14 15:00:20
If this is true, it's the first we (and our lawyers) have heard of it. 
@_date: 2011-06-24 15:49:55
My job is answering customer inquiries, and my hobby is browsing reddit. My passion is doing whatever I can to help bitcoin gain momentum and acheive mainstream status. I've worked harder in the last 3 weeks than you will all year. Not for money, but because I love this community. Even people like you. People should care less aboit where the site came from and more about where its going. Magic the gathering to the volume it is today... Companies rarely go from needing 1 person to 100 people in the span of a few weeks. Hate less, help more. 
@_date: 2011-07-22 14:20:01
As an FYI - You can send a SEPA payment in GBP/EUR to our bank in the UK, and although we trade in USD there is nothing taken off the top for the exchange. We think thats pretty reasonable.
Access to a larger market is probably the biggest reason. I'm not here to twist anyones arm or to say what makes the most sense for them - but I'm definitely taking notes. 
@_date: 2011-08-04 23:55:52
The code was fine. It's the upgrade we fumbled.

If you send EUR to our bank in France we do the exchange for no fee and at the European Central Banks daily rate. You can't really beat that ;)

Hello, We've received about 10-12 complaints recently that funds have gone missing or accouts have been compromised. This is extremely unfortunate, and we will do whatever we can to assist. That being said, I think its fairly obvious the delays in answering emails is unacceltable, so we're fine if you want to bring our attention to these very serious issues in a public forum responsibly. I'd like to repeat, out of 40,000 users 10-12 have reported this kind of activity. Based solely on this amount, we really don't believe there is a security hole in Mt.Gox. Also, if there was, hackers would likely be going after large sums. **Please take responsibility as users. Secure your computers, use trusted websites, make your usename/password for Mt.Gox both unique and choose more difficult passwords. We will look at implementing a withdraw password soon, because this kind of activity/theft is inevitable**

If you're seeing anything like this, please email us. I won't lie, its going to take some time for us to get through to your issue, but we've got the old DB to reference. We'll make sure the funds are refeuded so long as there is a record of them.

We want to help, we just need to make sure it's *you*. We know it's a pain in the  but it's less of a pain than if we give your account away to a different person. Just add some info to your claim and we're happy to review the additional info. 
PS: In the past if someone has stolen my credit card, or my bank account has been jacked, my bank has frozen my accounts and grilled me on my information.

Yeah, it takes some time to get to our account, then for us to process. Frustrating, considering everything else is the world is practically instant.. ;)

Sorry to just come out and say it, but this response is just a little too juvenile to be taken seriously. I honestly don't think the government is going to sit around a big table and dumb bitcoin down to say "THIS IS GIVING PEOPLE ***FREEDOM***, THIS CANNOT BE ALLOWED." 
Rationally, they'll look at it and go... "How do we tax this?... *okay*, we need to tax this....we ***can't*** tax this... Yup, we need to make this illegal".

100 BTC = Volume of 100
It doesn't matter how many smaller trades they are broken up into. We reference your trade volume over the last 30 day (relative to when the trade executes) and apply the discount based on this in real time.

It's in the list of ways to deposit under the "Add Funds" section of the site. "Barclays" is the answer though. Unfortunately, we don't have an automated with to do withdraws with them yet, and don't know if we will be able to. We're going to be negotiation with HSBC next week, and agree this would be ideal for many and more users so we hope to have accounts setup soon.

We are obliged to, and are in the process of taking responsibility. The only accounts that are at risk are those with weak passwords. So, my comment still stands. I will apolgize profusely for our insolence if there is new information that shows the database was hacked.

For the sake of clarity, what financial services are you comparing with Bitcoin exchanges? 
@_date: 2011-06-16 04:48:49
An exchange cannot exist otherwise. If you think they can, get out the popcorn. 
To add to this, until there are merchants from far and wide that allow purchases in bitcoin, it's just irrational to believe we can act differently. So long as the bitcoin economy is forced to interface with "real" currencies and people need to extract the value of their bitcoins to actually buy "stuff", there is going to be a wall to scale. 
If you or anyone else doesn't like it, then you/us/we need to work hard and fast towards getting merchants on board with accepting bitcoins.

Do you *honestly* think we bribed Dwolla? I'm a conspiracy geek too at times but... I'll just give you a flat "No, no we haven't bribed, convinced or done anything but inform" Dwolla about potential circumstances. It is entirely possible that this could happen to us, and it may very well be that our limits have dissuaded people from trying, or maybe we were just lucky, but we are much bigger targets and (I'm not implying anything) we've only been sincere and forthcoming since working with Dwolla. Besides that we don't see what makes us less vulnerable.
