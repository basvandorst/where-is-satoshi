That's where I see we should be focusing our attention... With btc and other cryptos we can actually disrupt system.
We can solve problems like housing crisis, high rent, homelessness, wealth disparity, fairer pay, etc with btc...
But our attention isn't focused on that... It's focused on HODLing.
The value of btc isn't much if it's just a store of value, we need to be designing new and better systems and processes that enable society to exchange and use crypto as a form currency. 
Only then will we be able to free ourselves from third party corruption and manipulation.

Btc is a movement and if we lose sight of what fueled that movement from the start, we lose our values and beliefs, and as a result we lose our culture. 
Without a defined culture, we will he unable to rally the support to stand up to attempts to bring the movement down.
Btc is the people, by the people, for the people. Can't lose that vision of a society free from the corruption and manipulation of third parties... Banks, government, corporations who cunningly steal our liberties.

Better features do not fuel a movement, values and beliefs do...
The crypto movement is losing it's culture shifting from "creating a world free of corruption" to a "lets get rich quick scheme."

I think it has less to do with tech versus non-technical. You don't have to understand how something works to understand why something is important.
The problem is that people have lost sight or are confused about the why.

Couldn't agree more with you on this. price is the least interesting thing about btc and crypto in general. 
We're losing sight of a movement that could alter the way we live, think , and do things.
