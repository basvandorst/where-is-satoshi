I don't think it's a ripoff when the price is so volatile.
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:54:42
I think the biggest hinderance is security, maintaining a secure wallet requires tech savy that many just don't have.

Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:15:31
Hmmm, thanks but maybe later.
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:34:36
Thanks! This is what I was looking for in a response.  I hadn't considered storing collateral in the block chain - I can definitely see some pros and cons to that method.

As someone new to bitcoin I'm excited about the .013 bitcoins I've been able to amass and am totally jealous you have more than that to just donate...I've been collecting from give away sites (my only option) since August. :(
You could save them until you have enough to buy electronis from new egg...
@_date: 2014-12-31 17:52:46
Tried it, let me know if it doesn't work. Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:56:27
I was assuming in the far future when it is more stable.  I hadn't heard of this concept related to bitcoin and with it being so 'anonymous' I didn't know if it would be possible to set up a system similar to a current bank.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:04:28
Lol! Thanks. It has quite a few doorknobs, a functional roof, functional plumbing, functional a/c and get this...functional heat. :)
@_date: 2014-11-18 20:22:58
Maybe this is a colossally stupid question...but from an economic standpoint can't the side chains be forced to pay a fee (per x number of transactions)  to Bitcoin block miners so that they would still be encouraged to mine?
edit: sorry if this is really stupid, I don't know anything about the technology.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:46:32
Thanks, I didn't know there were cryptonewspapers.  I thought it would be a great way to generate interest in bitcoin so I'd hope it would go viral.
@_date: 2014-12-31 17:52:01
Yes, they are suing.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:07:39
Thanks! I would say the same, it is not a booth I would stop at.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:19:45
No one's talking about your 'need'.  Most companies want access to a large consumer base. Making up roughly half the population of the world suggests that companies would probably want to reach out to that consumer base.
The only 'special effort' is to make them feel reasonably comfortable in the current environment by acting in a mutually respectful manner.

This may be a moronic monday question, but if they have funds in cold storage,  why not post the public address? Can't it be viewed on the blockchain without being at risk (because the private keys are secure)? My apologies if this is a silly question. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:09:09
Hi! :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:56:44
How do they affect you?
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:59:06
Thanks, didn't  know there was one, I'll get it. :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:04:38
Ok, I have a couple.
Regarding cold storage: 
* If I want to create a wallet.dat file on a computer not connected to the internet, can I just install the bitcoin protocol from a usb if that protocol has never been kept up to date with the blockchain?  
* How do I get the addresses from the wallet.dat file so I can print them?  
* I'm installing on a completely disconnected computer with the goal of printing to paper then removing the wallet.dat file - can I delete the file permanently once I have the public/private keys?
* Is it safe to say that I only need to sweep the wallet if I make spend transactions from that wallet? 
* Is it possible to sweep a wallet if the original wallet.dat is deleted but you have the public/private keys (maybe you would just send to a new wallet after x many transactions)?
Thanks to everyone who helps us morons! :)

If you send me .259 bitcoin now, I will investigate this matter and get back to you in 12 hours, I promise. Someoneelsesaid you can trust me.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:49:12
In my opinion, yes. In my experience, yes.
Ask it like this - "If we didn't have booth babes would women stay away?" or "If we get a 'booth babe' will more women (other than the models) come?"
The answer is probably not.  But having them may make women stay away or create a point of contention that would have to be explained and would act as a deterrent rather than an attractant.
If you want to have a party where you hire a whole bunch of hot women to stand around and pretend to be interested while you talk about crypto-currency, have at it.  There is a place and market for it (probably).  
I'm just saying that when trying to encourage widespread adoption from the general populace and trying to build public awareness, having booth babes is not the best idea.
Being respectful never goes out of style (imho).

Precisely why Mr. Antonopoulos is a class act. :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:52:51
Have you been to any conferences? How welcoming was it? I watched part of the 2014 Texas conference women panel, and it looked like they didn't get a very welcoming crowd.  I haven't gone through all the videos and wasn't there, interested in your opinion.

Total noob. Trying to get in/understand/find ways to apply it to my industry (auto) and feeling so outdated every time I learn something new. Tried so hard to make it to a local meetup this week so I could ask questions and life happened.  I'm beginning to feel like a dinosaur...:(
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:23:30
I made it! Thank you for the list! :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:53:44
I know I'm late but hopefully you'll answer. ..isn't a wallet supposed to generate a new address every time you spend and a new private key as well? I'm sure these aren't one time use, I think I just don't understand how transactions work....
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:58:17
Thanks, sorry about your luck. Here's to the moon :)
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:52:20
The attack map you posted is memorizing...I have no idea what it means though.

I have a 2005 mariner in michigan that's in your price range.
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:56:00
Thanks! It seems the most secure way to keep bitcoin (besides a Trezor) is to make an offline wallet, so if I install the bitcoin protocal on a computer not connected to the internet does it automatically  generate a useable wallet.dat file or do I also need to download a copy of the blockchain  for that to work?
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:56:32
Seems reasonable,  it would be nice!
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:40:20
That sounds amazing (Blockchain University - I'm totally googling this)! Have fun tomorrow!  Do you have programming experience outside of this experience?

May I please have some bits kind internet stranger?

@_date: 2015-01-25 20:27:54
Thanks, I've read a bit about electrum, maybe I'll do some investigating. I'm  just hesitant to put up any money until I'm positive I can keep it safe. Quite hard to be sure of, in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:28:30
I've been trying faucets for a little while and you earned more in this one post than I have in a month.  Just out of curiosity what wallet service did you use?
My biggest hurdle to putting more money in is not being able to set up an offline secure wallet.  Have you done this yet?
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:42:00
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:46:38
I tried this and never heard back. Has anyone tried it and been successful?

I missed some of the presentations because of work - is there a link anywhere to a recorded version?

My favorite quote.

@_date: 2015-02-12 20:58:25
Mint (and similar apps) are really popular among the personal finance crowd and using bitcoin at the moment would not give you all that info - might be an idea for a dapp
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:08:51
So, what other type of info is in the header (i.e. could they only mine transactions from China, or only ones where people want to store data in the blockchain, or give priority to certain addresses)?  Seems like it could be a pretty big way to manipulate the bitcoin economy, no?
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:16:32
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:30:56
Wahoo! Thankss in advance. :)
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:21:58
I think you missed his point, cash is fairly easy to secure. Bitcoin...not so much.  All he's saying is that it needs to be easier for the average joe to secure bitcoin before there will be mass adoption.
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:50:34
If the miners are still mining block rewards, why are there miner fees on current transactions?  
Shouldn't transactions be free until all the bitcoins are created - sometime in 2040 (iirc)?
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:17:17
How far outside of flint...it's not a nice area to go to.
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:23:36
Thanks for the response.  I didn't know they could choose to include transactions...how do they decide? If I include a miner fee in my transaction does that come across in some kind of header information?  Can they sort/choose transactions based on the amount of the fee?  Can they sort/choose what transactions to include based on other header information? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:18:29
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:39:12
Did he? I don't know and would love a source...if you're invested in your opinion, that is...
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:16:02
So if he really ordered hits on people I'm glad he's in jail...kind of like Capone and tax evasion - it doesn't matter what they got him for if he's a bad dude and I'd prefer him to not be in public...
