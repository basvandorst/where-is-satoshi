Link is dead, someone has another one?
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:29:09
Thank you for your effort
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:51:33
Could that make exchanges vulnerable? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:56:30
Can confirm, works again. Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:51:14
Is it, or will you put it on F-droid?
As FOSS
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:13:58
but how would you do that without the network fee? Or does OP strictly refer to extra coinbase fees?
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:36:39
Don't be the guy promoting this guy
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:44:14
Did he do anything illegal? Why would the police be looking for him?
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:26:14
I thought 11nm was the physical limit.

Yeah I thought so, is the grid stable? Blackouts are uncommon? 
How much power does your mining pool consume? 
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:26:00
If you only use a third of the potential power of the PSU the efficiency suffers. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 03:33:40


In what form and how much? 
@_date: 2014-02-24 02:26:27
It this really Bitcoin exclusive? I imagine any "cash" currency in the USA is treat like this.
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:53:26


Is that possible? A transaction that paid no fee can get "lost"??
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:18:56
My explanation makes sense to me, where am I wrong?
@_date: 2014-01-01 17:19:21
Yeah typo, well that's pretty brash if true.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:59:22


Do you have an iPhone? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:31:37
Is the program already removed from sourceforge?

RemindMe! 20 hours "check for follow up"
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:24:09
I gathered that, but how come two similar western States have so drastically different laws?
@_date: 2014-01-30 08:18:07
Okay, whoosh on my part, sorry.
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:44:16
Boy, that's horrible. Are they ruined or do they own more than 4 million $ ?
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:50:19
How much do you pay for the electricity at night? And how much power (kW) does your mining pool consume? 
Would a [solar battery]( be interesting for you, could make your hole farm energy independent?

@_date: 2014-07-23 19:49:35


How much did you get in total?
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:56:53
Shouldn't deflation be good for "everyone". 


Through better technology and higher productivity the money of the people would become more valuable and "everybody" but maybe banks would benefit.
Does this make sense?

Why is it so much easier in Vancouver? 
@_date: 2014-07-23 21:28:44
I'm surprised people didn't keep sending you btc. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:03:16
[XBT or BTC](
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:03:17
Sad that this is a common reaction now, [self-censorship works](
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:28:04
Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:14:25
I think it does. Purple shirt guy asks "how is this different to regular banking system?" - "I can't charge you fees."
~~Meaning~~ Implying imho the difference is no fees. If the "**I**" in "**I** can't charge you fees" was emphasised it would be more clear.
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:09:22
Doesn't he lose all his bitcoin when dropping the notebook since his wallet was on it?
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:55:49
True. It's complicated but I'd (imho) prefer a consistent identifier.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:45:04

Can they compete with AMD cards now? Nvidia cards used to not even reach half the hash power of AMDs.
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:14:22
Where is all this hashing power coming from?  Is the BFL Monarch really shipping now?
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:08:43
In just 2 months?? Do we know their hashrate? 
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:39:32
Yeah asia, all the same right. 
Do you have an iPhone? 
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:55:59
citation needed, the studies I've seen suggest mass surveillance doesn't help to prevent crimes.
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:19:10
No they weren't, they confirmed via twitter.^^/s ^^lol


@_date: 2014-02-24 23:02:11
Do you get some kind of notification when that happens?
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:34:44
I doubt the go and buy a new iPhone full price to smash it. They gonna use their old iPhones which already lost value and get a brand new Phone.
Still a small lose maybe.
@_date: 2014-01-01 06:13:38
Do they even exi**s**t? I never saw one. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:19:47
That's their point. OP should have said "donate" your phones instead of smashing them.
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:40:05
Did you see [this](

@_date: 2016-01-05 02:25:50
Can you also buy bitcoin with amazon funds?
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:59:03
Implying that bitcoin is fee free.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:36:30
Maybe we should orientate ourself on the International Standards Organization (ISO) that keeps a list of currencies.
Who calls it "XBT" because currencies not associated with a country start with an “X.”
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:32:35
About 200,000 passengers cars per day worldwide
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:39:26
We are in the millions now.  Not that the argument makes any sense
@_date: 2018-10-28 23:52:13
What's the point of bitcoin in your opinion?
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:58:16
PLEASE keep us updated. 
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:03:58
Musk likes BTC, I wish Tesla would accept BTC for payment.
@_date: 2019-06-18 00:54:47
Because fomo
@_date: 2019-02-20 17:59:05
Why should it even drive like a race car, it's a sporty every day car
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:23:51
Is investing in btc "adoption"?
@_date: 2019-06-18 00:57:53
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:54:09
Why, if they show empty?
@_date: 2015-07-18 19:00:56
So if I'm patient I could buy thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins by buying them 240€ at a time?
@_date: 2019-12-08 15:56:06
btc's problem is that if it really becomes a threat the state can just shut off the internet. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 18:57:51
How is the process if you buy more than 250€ or 500€ worth of bitcoins?

~~Horrible feature~~, imagine your sweaty hands after a failed try or even the second
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:13:13
ha yeah, probably 'cause I'm an old fart but this was the best argument why bitcoin will fail I saw.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:58:55
Right, fair point.
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:13:39
But what he says is bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:29:51
But does it have electrolytes?
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:44:57
Do you know about [civil forfeiture](
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:14:19
Why hate cops who do that they have to do because of laws politicians made. Shouldn't they be the ones getting the hate? 
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:51:51
You mean the fidor bank? you don't get that warning because you only have to contact the federal bank if you transfer funds to an foreign account, like one in the netherlands. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:11:45
It's not if you report these big transaction *before* you make them, as I understand it, OP didn't do that and by doing so broke the law.
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:20:29


It's their fault for not getting authorization beforehand, but seeing that they "using a multi-level marketing" I'm glad they got banned. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:13:48
You have to report bank transfers to an foreign account (even if it's yours) above 12.500€ in Germany.
@_date: 2017-05-02 09:26:47
I know, it was a comparison that the US isn't great either. imho far worse.
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:45:59
It's not illegal.
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:09:08
No it's not a police state and it's not recent, this has been illegal since 1985.
If you don't like that law, try to get it changed. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:02:52
You should look up civil forfeiture.
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:49:22
Even if you get rich, please finish your education. For me it changed the way I see the world.
@_date: 2016-07-24 23:04:58
He supposedly had Breivik [as his profil picture in whatsapp]( and police said he was interested in him.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:14:57
You and me both. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:33:16
to the next sock puppet account
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:49:00
Inactive since two years, hopefully because he's rich now.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:49:19
I don't remember which drive said wallet was installed on I believe it was on a drive that is now part of a raid for years and has been overwriten hundreds of times. Other possible drives I have checked with recuva, no luck. 
I did find a not-so-old backup of my wallet but that .dat file was empty. (checking for that is as easy as copying the backup file in the root folder of a synced -qt wallet and starting it, right?)
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:15:25
Four, actually


@_date: 2019-05-13 12:48:36
What  makes you say that  they are shills?
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:54:45
I used a local bitcoin-qt wallet and didn't backup the "wallet.dat" file, this is where the private keys are stored correct? I still have my wallet Password but without that file it's useless, right?
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:28:04
[Alloscomp.com port scan]( ^not ^sure ^if ^reliable.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:31:31
You should add the bitcoin logo to the logos of accepted pay methods at the bottom of the page.
How does that "insulation from exchange rate fluctuations" work?
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:33:35
And how do you pay for that?
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:21:35
In a house? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:00:10
But "just on" and under heavy load from mining is a huge difference in electricity consumption, mind you.
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:19:57
I wasn't interested in btc for a while, back when it was still about 10$-15$
for one btc.
So, could someone please tell me what the heck happened? What huge market opened up to btc that they get so rare/expansive.
Edit: Thank you Mr. Bond and Grizmoblust
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:13:22
Thanks, so you live with the people you work for?
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:19:10
Ah, figured it's a template you can't change.
Well that's a really cool way to do it for businesses, no reason not to try it, oh and "free plan,  charges 1%" har har.
But still a lot better than paypal!
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:29:59


Really? What about Dwolla?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:18:25
What if, *for some reason*, I don't have a large printout QR code of my address handy? Why can't I type it in? Or can I display the QR code with a smartphone or similar?
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:42:14
He *did* post the paper, so at least put some effort into it?
@_date: 2013-03-26 03:55:43
I gathered that, but why did the demand rise so drastically?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:18:50
Huge jump in [the estimate to 6.5Ph/s]( so more like 800mio difficulty next. **Edit: 885mio.**
