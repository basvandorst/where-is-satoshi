Way too slow. Difficulty will be 4 times what is now by then and no way in hell you are getting positive ROI.

Yep you are right. Deleting.

Three well educated? I only see one.

9k? What kind of crazy person thinks this is a good investment? It will never hit positive ROI. 
Unless Difficulty stagnates. (I find this very hard to believe, I think We'll see at least 150TH/s within a month or two)

Yeah I really low balled it. I've been reading a bit more and if most of the promised hardware from bfl, asicminer, bit fountain and avalon is delivered a 10x difficulty increase is not unlikely within August. Just Asicminer is probably up to 200Th/s by then.

I'd say lastpass + two factor authentication (most exchanges support yubi or Google authenticator)

Bill Maher is funny and all... But he make a complete fool of himself every times he speaks about technology. I had to groan out loud when he didn't understand the consequences of censoring gun plans for 3d printers on last weeks show.

AM shares is less work then having your own farm. 
*And probably less risky when you consider that your GPU farm has a fixed output while asicminer is adding a shit ton of hashing power the next few months.

What asset is backing this?

What wall? Technical Analysis is pretty hilarious.

Remember when Dilbert was funny? Me neither.

I ignored it because it's not very interesting. If AM can keep up the dividends there is no reason for the the sock prices to fall. In dividend stocks and bonds the only thing that really matters is the yield when you are buying them. if the price crashes you will get a much higher yield and that will pull in investors looking for higher returns. This is exactly how it works in the real stock market and it is one of the reasons you can't find bonds or stocks with this high yield in the real stock market. 
Risk is another matter completely and I agree with you. Personally I wont buy AM for this high price because of the risk. I will however buy more if the yield is too good to ignore even at high risk.

What does max dividend have to do with it? A 2btc/share price gives 26% return YOY @ 0.01 weekly dividend (Very safe bet IMO). 26% ROI yearly is very good.

If you are using ssh for a high profile site you can really harden your security by using two factor authentication for ssh. But in this case I doubt it was a weak password that got exploited. My guess is a security issue (maybe 0-day) in the web framework (Ruby on Rails). Even access with a limited web server user can be enough to really wreak some havoc. 
The biggest issue Bitcoin sites have is that many seem to rely on "hot wallets". i.e. unencrypted wallets. It should be possible to design a system where every transaction a key is needed to decrypt the wallet from the user. I think the blockchain.info wallet service does this. Also running all wallet operation on a completely separate host with a limited API against the web host could be a good idea, at least for slowing down the attacker.

Have you really not seen this before? It's very common.
@_date: 2013-05-21 14:32:44


Wat? It means you get 20% (It's actually closer to 35%, atm) back year over year on your investment in dividends at the current share price. This is how yield is calculated in all shares. 20% yield is very good even in very risky blue-chip stocks.
I see no reason they can't keep up that yield. All they need to do is stay at about 20% of network hash rate. And they are keeping very well so far. The hardware sales are just a bonus.

I think you forgot the water cooling rig you need to get those 7950 cards over clocked that high. Anyway. How long will this yield 70$/week?
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:08:38
Maybe if you are the only one thinking like this. I can't imagine the used GPU market can swallow all the unprofitable cards at that high price.
