Personally I do my personal banking with First Direct, they are by far and a way the best bank.
But for crypto and other things, I have Halifax, Lloyd's, Barclays, Santander, RBS, Natwest &amp; co-op.
All free basic accounts opened in a few minutes online. There's absolutely no reason to bank only with one, and actually it was useful recently, a scammer on Localbitcoins nearly stole £800 from me. Luckily they did not, thanks entirely to Lloyd's.
But for a few days while it was being sorted out my Lloyd's account where the funds went was frozen.
So it was lucky that my direct debts all come from RBS, my personal spending cash is in First Direct, and savings are in Co-op. Which meant I didn't fail any payments and still had access to funds.
Just to be clear, if you recieve stolen funds into one account let's say Lloyd's, and transfer it out into another lets say Santander, Lloyd's will freeze both their accounts and the Santander accounts. So you should leave the funds in Lloyd's if using local bitcoins for a week before transferring out to make sure it's legitimate. Or withdraw in cash.
Personally, I am done with local bitcoins now and sticking to exchanges. There is too much risk.
This person had a lot of feedback, all ID, selfie etc. But I figured out something was wrong and had to drive 3 hours each way to the house on the ID to warn the person who owned the account.
The only reason I lost out was because they deemed it that she had been grossly negligent by giving out her account login details along with her identification documents.
For the sake of getting funds the same day, instead of next day by SEPA, it's just not worth it.

They also need to evolve to double the drivethrough queues to speed up the process, like McDonald's have at all their drive througs, but KFC are still struggling with queues down the street with their single lanes.
Double is better.

I think we're a significant way off from being more secure than the banks, and we can never be cheaper or faster than free and instant access and transferring. 
In first world countries that is...
Bank deposits are insured for £75k per account for a bank going under, and 100% for fraud, something you can't be assured of with bitcoin without lots of backups and even then there is always copy/paste attacks or fraud on places localbitcoins etc, so you need to use an exchange which comes with high fees and no protection if they go under and take all your coins with them. It's only secure if you keep it totally offline and never use them. (I nearly lost £370 a few weeks back due to fraud on localbitcoins, had lots of feedback, all ID docs for the account, a selfie etc. But was all stolen. It was the banks that protected both me and the girl whose identity was stolen by refunding us both for losses 1 day later, while the thief took off with the coins and no way to trace them). 
Wire transfers are instantaneous and free within country so bitcoin cant compete with that, it can be marginally faster than international next day transfers, though it can also be much longer with no guarantee of timescale.
And fiat debit cards are accepted everywhere without charge to the consumer. 
Yes vendors have to pay a fee for the fiat system, but at least that system is a set fee that they can easily budget for with no surprises (And of course reliability). Variable fees just arent good for anyone. And from a sales point of view, those that accept crypto will likely see slumps in sales on days when the fees are higher. 
So imagine the christmas boom comes, everyone starts spending, fees go up as a result, and so sales drop back down again. Thats no good for the vendors who need to be able to predict sales and income. 
I'm totally behind crypto currencies, but not because they could ever have any benefit for first world people, but because they do offer benefit for third world people. 
If the residents of Zimbabwe had access to bitcoin in 2001 onwards they wouldn't be in the state they are now when their currency collapsed.
The trouble is, the people who can actually benefit from crypto as a currency are totally priced out of the market when average fees are more than they earn in a month, with any chance of reducing them a long way off yet. Hopefully they can speed up the process.

Its very possible its been intercepted for background checks. 
If they know, they are prevented by law from telling you. As this would be 'tipping off' which is an offence they obviously wont want, so its likely they wont respond at all of it they do itll be a generic holding message. 
If you've sent to others before then its even more likely to be that, the more you do it the more likely it is to be flagged.

Only the first one is Hybrid. The second and third are electric. 
Polestar used to be Volvos performance team, now they are a sister brand launching soon. 
But a premium experience motor company. (You cant buy them, just an all inclusive lease scheme with concierge). 
With the backing of a large company who already has an extensive dealer network. 
Though that said, hybrids are more popular and useful.

You laugh, but in my younger years when I worked in finance we had been dealing with someone who was beyond late with payments. 
Anywho, long story short... they said the reason they couldn't make any payment at all that month was because they had to take the kids to Disney Land for Christmas. 
Well, you know damned straight when they came back from holiday the house was securely boarded up.

When they announced they were adding cash, and it was spotted that they had added an API for trading it and told everyone. I immediately swapped half my bitcoin for cash. When I noticed I was suddenly up and quickly I changed all the rest into cash too. 
On that part I am very happy with coinbase. 
But... 
I am not happy that I tried to transfer out my ether to my wallet 2 days ago and they stuck it in pending. I assume because I am travelling in Morocco. And even though I uploaded the ID and selfie to speed up the process its still pending. Or I would have changed that into cash last night too. 
Dammit.

It's a bit like saying 'Hey look SMS is expensive and slow so... we've made iMessage which is a free and almost slightly faster way to txt people and send photos. I mean sure it's not compatible with android or windows or blackberry phones which the majority of people use, and everyone else is already using Whatsapp as a free, faster and more versatile solution  than iMessage which is also compatible with everything that already exists... but iMessage!!!! Oh also iMessage wont be supported by older hardware, so you'll have to pay to upgrade it.. iMessage is the future!!'

That actually is entirely unbelievable. Where were you sending to? 
Transferwise would have been no more than a few bucks.
I sent 20,000 Eur to another country in another currency the other day and it was 50 Eur.
And yesterday sending 4,500 Eur was only 11 Eur.
And that's for instant delivery to the recipient banks, it's half the cost if I don't mind waiting a bit.

You cannot have bitcoin, with its second layers and long delays and high costs as scoring the same as fiat.
Fiat is the easiest, to transact, everybody understands it, from the age of 3.
But if you want to use broader strokes and consider bitcoin to be as easy to transact as fiat, then you cannot have alt coins as less easy to transact. Most are easier, due to not needing second layers, etc. So what is the justification?
Either bitcoin isn't as easy to transact as fiat (it clearly isn't). Or all crypto currencies are easy to transact.
Bitcoin being one of the hardest learning curves, can't be marked as easier than any of the others.
And that's before you get onto the point of 'you can't transact with it, if its not accepted anywhere yet'
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:46:18

@_date: 2019-10-01 02:09:33
Those apps like Tikkie are just gimmicks.
The UK banks have had instantaneous and free transactions from any bank to any bank for longer than Bitcoin has existed, and doesn't require anything additional, nothing new to learn, no conversions and different wallets etc. 
And sending money abroad is still faster and cheaper than with Bitcoin using other methods. 
Its for those reasons nobody cares about it for its primary purpose, and just as a gamble to make money from people in other countries who are being taken advantage of by outdated banking systems.
Outdated systems which, if the bank feel any kind of real threat will just be updated.

Did you just read the last sentence which wasn't at all related to my point and just a side note, and decide to reply to that instead?
What's so difficult about the learning curve?
Explain lightning to a 3yr old...
Now give them a toy till and some coins.
Now do the same with an 80yr old.
Its obviously no where near as simple as fiat. 
So my primary point is that you've claimed bitcoin is as easy to use as fiat, but that other cryptos are harder. It's is obviously wrong.
Either all cryptos including bitcoin are as easy as fiat (they aren't), or all cryptos including bitcoin are harder (they are).
You cannot have bitcoin with a different score to other cryptos when it is actually harder than most of them to use.
But to answer your points - why do you think it's cheap to transact?
At its peak popularity people were paying $15 to send funds, and waiting hours for them to go through. That's an insane amount.
When sending money between bank accounts, even to other banks has been instantaneous and free for the past 15 years, bitcoin can never gain traction like that.
So yes. Then here comes lightening, so great, now we've just centralised it. But ignoring that argument, you still have to pay to get your coins on and off of it. Which is again ridiculous.
If for some reason crypto currencies will ever be mass adopted, (its very unlikely let's be honest with ourselves), then I can see bitcoin being the big player for a couple of years, but once more people understand about it, it'll be dropped for something else.
Picture this, when/if mass adoption comes, it's unlikely that any store is going to accept only one currency, they are going to just have a multi wallet with as many currencies as possible in there.
Now people see bitcoin taking hours or days to clear a transaction, then they see the price of the payment being unpredictable, somedays its 15c, some days its $15.
Then they look at other currencies, for example DGB, one of the oldest currencies, not much younger than bitcoin, with the longest chain out there.
Then they see that no matter what or how many people are using it, the fee is still $0.00000005 at the most. Which we can essentially call, free. Anything less than a penny I'd consider free.
Then they see that it's virtually instantáneos.
Then they see they don't need to work out and run lightning nodes when onchain transactions are already faster and free. - So why would they?
To say bitcoin is cheap, is plainly wrong. Its more expensive and slower than fiat, and it's more expensive and slower than other cryptos.
But back to my main point so you don't lose it again like last time, and that is that it's not easier to use than others, it's either harder, or as easy, but not easier.
And its definitely harder than fiat.
So that line is wrong. So if you show this to anyone outside of the community they will see that line as being blatently wrong, and assume there are mistakes elsewhere in the chart, and so dismiss it altogether.
