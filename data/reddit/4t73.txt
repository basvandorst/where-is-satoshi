No, you aren't missing anything. This company comes along and says they will put bitcoin chips in every single thing on earth, and if you believe it at face value thats huge news. Of course, you have to be naive or desperate for good news to believe it, must be at that point. If what they are saying is true, it's either useless or annoying. Everyone is talking about power usage, thats obvious so i won't even mention it. Here are it's uses according to them:
Micro-transactions. Yes, the thing the whole internet hates is now a poster child for this company. 
IOT.  Does it mean every appliance in my house will monitor the blockchain for a message specifically to it? Because that is really inefficient and it seems like what they want to do with it. And if it doesn't do it that way, it might as well not bother with bitcoin at all because it's just the normal client-server relationship any other device would use. 
And uh, thats it. [Seruiously](
Now users are talking about non monetary uses, AKA contracts and signatures. Bitcoin solves no problems better than existing solutions that I can think of in those areas. A PKC signature doesn't need bitcoin to work and autonomous micro payment contracts, don't make me laugh. My TV used a fraction of a penny to promise something? What does that really affect at all? Nothing, it's a gimmick. If autonomous contracts will work, they need real money in escrow, a fair value based on what they are contracting. This is impractical, but at least it would do something.
