How about this, Goldman Sachs did it to try and get everyone talking about manipulation in Bitcoin to encourage the SEC to delay their decision again.
Then "someone" encouraged Trump to employ another pro-Bitcoin ETF commissioner. 
So if you read this in the most basic light, Banks are playing a games and being check-mated by whoever advised Trump's choice.

I forgot the 3 letter name but you triggered a criminal case with your activity. Its been passed to the internal money laundering team who have 15 days to decide whether or not to pass it to the police. If they do the police are obliged to proceed with it. Youre actually allowed 200gbp a week right now by law.
This is why bitcoin is growing in popularity, more people are realizing that banks are a scam.
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:46:55
Fascinating. Thanks for the information, so the properties held their value in USD terms because no one was prepared to sell at a loss unless they had to. But because of the cheaper labor its massively cheaper to just build the similar property yourself - however the land I imagine is also holding its value in USD terms. So the new build constructions have stopped? Can we conclude that land and property, assuming you were able to hold onto it, ended up being an effective hedge to hyperinflation in practice?

The TA on his chart is completely wrong, the bottom line should be horizontal from the largest daily bounce (6000USD) which price has visibly bounced from twice since and the descending line should be adjusted since it was broken twice without an obvious reaction and is now invalid.
But well done for trying, you'll get there one day lol.

Since I bought into Bitcoin this has kind of been a life motto. I mean, I do literally nothing and it's working **incredibly** well. Between my experience and this article I think we can all take something home from this.
@_date: 2018-09-07 14:47:14
Yes it was, the price action was being compressed against the descending trend-line without any significant bounces off of it, which signifies a build up of pressure. The trade long would be executed upon the break and would be significant due to the double pressure as failed shorts close.
 If you read Bob Volman's book "Understanding Price Action: practical analysis" there are entire sections devoted to this and if you read Forex Price Action Scalping by the same author you'll see almost all of these trading methods are based off of this same concept.
If you then consider that I'm a retired professional trader and made my money directly from trading price action, you might appreciate that you are actually wrong.

Right now if you want to buy Bitcoin you need to use a Bitcoin Exchange. These are constantly getting hacked because they're run by no names in a new industry.
If there is a Bitcoin ETF now you don't need to deal with complicated shady enterprises to "own" Bitcoin. Instead literally everyone in the USA that is already investing will have access to Bitcoin with a single click.
It's incredibly significant. *Incredibly*.

The whole thing is a joke, I have a feeling someone intelligent is going to tear the entire thing apart in the coming days. The miners are losing hashrate, nodes are dropping off and failing, transactions aren't relaying - and all this without a single 32MB block. Some miners are still mining 3MB blocks meaning there is literally a backlog creating a fee market - the entire point of the big block scaling method is to prevent this. The whole thing has been a total failure. But guess what? Some are celebrating it in rbtc. I don't just understand the levels of stupidity.

I'm talking about the UK.
The bank checks the payment/account and send the information to the team within the bank, if they determine it doesn't look right they freeze the account and send the information to the NCA with a SAR, if the bank doesn't hear back within 7 days from the NCA (The time limit you said doesn't exist is specifically noted in the link above) its unfrozen. But the banks generally allow 7 days before they send the report, to determine if its required and then create the report - the whole thing takes 15 days.
If after 15 days (working days) it isn't unfrozen its generally because there is now an active police investigation and they're probably filing for a restraint order against the accused assets.

It's not trading just to hold losing positions and waiting till it gets better. All it means is you're guaranteed to liquidate your entire account when it goes wrong.
What you did was prove every Grade C level trader and above's knowledge correct, that you never trade without a SL.
You should only, per trade, be risking 1-3% of your account and have a Stop Loss that represents at least a 2:1 ratio to your take profit per trade.
On this basis being correct just 60% of the time means you will make a profit long term. Do you see how with simple rules its almost impossible to go wrong? Do you see how such simple rules make it absolutely impossible to do what you did? Even if you lost 10 times in a row you're still going to be fine over the course of the year.
Unfortunately, this was always going to happen to you. Because you lacked the most basic money management principles.
Now your question is did your broker take advantage of you? Well, they led you to a market where they knew your stupid "strategy" would backfire almost immediately and they literally just let you do your thing. But you should understand, that for certain, it was going to happen to you eventually anyway.
There's been no foul play by them, you should never have been managing real money in the first place. I'm being serious, real money is for when you understand **basic** money management principles.
This is coming from someone who was long the *entire* run up from about 1k USD and closed the position at about 17k USD.
I do feel very sorry for your situation, but at the same time, this is how markets work.

You're giving me homework when I've seen this in action. Tether is the most recent example, r/btc created FUD (which is an even smaller forum than this) and a few weeks later Crypto Outlets picked it up. In the end some mainstream news mentioned it. Then Tether had to hire a Law firm to prove it was false. All from bullshit rumors in r/btc that were proved to be false.
In fact Tether was even used as a reason in letters to the SEC why the ETF should be rejected and these articles were linked to proving it was a valid concern - do you see my point yet?

Capitalism/corporatism/Modern day economies are like a game of musical chairs with debt and USA is the music.
You all play around with the debt to get your new things, but if the music stops before you have finished paying then you hand it all to the Government.
In a system of illusions, where does the value actually come from? It comes from the people who contribute for free to the Government with their assets and free labor (paying off debts) every-time the music stops!
It's a perfect system, just keep cycling it, there's always people who will work for free and give their things to the governments after all.
In comes Bitcoin. We will hold it and keep ourselves separate to these games, the people providing the value could never afford it in any kind of meaningful way anyway, so they'll always be part of the game.

u/leo_decar - the first line isn't innacurate at all, this poster just has a poor grasp of the English language. Banning the most prominent Crypto accounts on Chinese social media social media IS a "recent move to stop all Chinese social media from posting about Bitcoin".
Is this zxaslw saying that in order to "make a move" to prevent social media posts you have to had already successfully banned ALL mentions and prevented any future mentions of it on any social media? Obviously, that's an idiotic assertion. But moves WERE taken to stop Chinese social media talking about Bitcoin. Not only that but public Crypto meetings in general are now banned.....is their intent not clear enough for you zxaslw?

They can double their money. So you have 10,000BCH, you send them to an exchange, convert them to BTC....meanwhile you start mining on a new chain and send the same 10,000BCH to another exchange and convert them and maintain your hashpower on this chain. Then withdraw both sets of BTC. The first exchange gave you BTC and got nothing in return.
At this point various exchanges would delist BCH or at the least require considerably more confirmations, BCH's reputation would be finished as people realized it was too vulnerable.

You didn't understand what "hashrate follows price" actually meant when you were saying it previously. So it doesn't matter if you admit you were wrong, lol.

@_date: 2018-09-25 11:59:52
From when they determined the possibility of money laundering they must freeze the account, they then have 15 days to decide whether on not to pass it on. I'm pretty sure this is all outlined in public documents online. If the account remains frozen after 15 days it has been passed on and an investigation has been opened. If its not passed on the account is reopened after 15 days and they won't tell you why the whole thing happened, but they might still kick you out with a notice to remove your funds.

I got called stupid in the first response when what I'm saying is correct. That isn't politely disagreeing, they're calling me stupid when in fact it's them that is. After that why should I have patience for other people that think along the same lines as that first person?
It's obvious, any theory voted to the top of a Crypto sub can be picked up by Crypto news outlets. These then get picked up by mainstream news outlets.
The exact thing happened with Tether, from within r/btc even, it was picked up by Crypto outlets and then mainstream outlets - it became so well known (originating from REDDIT) that Tether had to hire a Law Firm.
So how can someone call me stupid for pointing out the fact that upvoting a post about manipulation (when the SEC rejected ETFs on the grounds of possible manipulation) is a bad idea? Why should this community validate the very concerns that restrict the growth of the same industry they apparently support? How can they be so shortsighted to think I was implying the SEC reads Reddit? Then have the gall to call me stupid when it's actually *them* who can't see the obvious implication.
Then I have to deal with a string of people commenting just to take the piss, culminating in you, who chimes in literally *just* to insult me and then claim some kind of moral high ground. People like you should be blocked by people like me, because unlike you I'm a serious person. So why should I have to waste my time like this.

Already bought this last week and just submitted a review, lets see if it gets approved:-
"This has to be the best purchase I have ever made in my life. The second I put it on I realized that this shirt was like no other shirt I had worn before and I've come to write a review to do a favor to humanity and spread the word.
Firstly, the material is so soft, softer than the feel of freshly cut grass under your bare feet on a warm spring morning. The fit, where do I begin? It just hugged my physique perfectly.
The design I believe is akin to the awe you feel when you're strolling through a lucious forest and stumble upon a waterfall. Everywhere I go in this the women can't take their eyes of me, the men too. But it always leads to the same question: What are those exquisite looking coins printed all over you?
Well, those are "Bitcoins"...I won't go into the details here but I will say that Bitcoin is definitely the future of global finance. You don't leave your car at a commercial garage, you don't leave your jewelry in the jewelry shop - so why do you leave your money in financial institutions? You trust yourself to look after you house, car, expensive watch, jewelry....but not your own money?
"Well that's because they make my life easier" you say? Well, what if you didn't need them anymore because you had even more instant control over your own money, no working times, no customer service desk, no fees and total privacy. Well, that's what Bitcoin provides you.
In short, you need to buy this Shirt, you also need to buy some Bitcoin. It's not 1990 anymore."

Things don't just happen overnight, there is a logical progression, the next stage would be institutional platforms to be created and to see the appetite from institutional investors.
These platforms have been being created over the last 6 months for the first time.
Any large corporation, before they encourage adoption of Bitcoin would first take their position, wouldn't they? For the first time they will have this ability.
So, "Paypal" buys in, then announces Bitcoin integration - they just made a fortune as normal people "adopt" (that you want to see). Facebook buys in, then announce integration as normal people "adopt"- they just made a fortune.
Before any big company encourages the average person, they first need their position established, obviously.
What you are waiting to see is literally the end game. I'm surprised as investors you and your colleagues can't see that.
You can wait for it to be successful and then say "right, its successful" - but who cares, everyone knows it at that point. The intelligence is to see how things are progressing and take the position early. It's really obvious how its progressing when the owner of the NYSE  makes an institutional trading desk, it couldn't be more obvious.
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:05:47


Not at all, you're entitled to your opinion in the same way I am.
When you say "believer" what do you mean? I'm a believer in the sense I'm aware it has unique uses and will increase in value as more people realize this. I'm a believer in the sense I use it.
Do I think it will replace USD? I don't really hold an opinion on that, it's guess work. Do I believe it will be more widely used at some point in the future? Yes, of course. 
I don't think there is ant risk of public outcry, if someone loses money in a Forex trade they don't get the broker closed down.
Bitcoin is whatever you use it as, because its permissionless. I use it as a decentralized store of value, I use it as an investment, I sometimes use it as a means to purchase things. You just use it as an investment, presumably because you also think more people will use it in some capacity, maybe one day you'll use it as something else.
Imagine if it goes to 50k and you decide to let it run, then you get sued and the government confiscates everything you have. When its all said and done you pack up and leave (USA?) for Europe, cash out your Bitcoin and still have a life. In that scenario your Bitcoin holdings saved your life. How much is that security worth for some people?

So the premise is that as long as US has a big military that USD is the best choice. So lets say in 2 years China Russia, Turkey and Iran form an alliance and Europe drops out of NATO....what's your top choice currency then? Or is it impossible that the US government pisses everyone off enough that they all join forces? It's already in the process.
On a separate note, what if the EU succeeds in creating an new financial system separate to the USA (as they've stated they intend to do)? Or if China is successful in replacing the petro-dollar with the CNY (as they are actively working on)?
This is what people like yourself and u/BigDaddyFatStackss don't get, the situation is about to change. It's you guys that are delusional about the state of stability.

Unless China bans mining, like they were planning to. Or maybe China makes cryptocurrency totally illegal.
Or the Government decide to seize Bitmain upon realizing BCH was used to evade China's capital controls in the middle of a trade war.
Or the buyers of Bitmain's IPO demand that Bitmain sells their BCH because it's costing the company too much.
Or Bitmain goes bust and they have to sell all their holdings.
Or Bitmain just decides it isn't worth propping BCH up anymore.
Or Jihan Wu falls out with Craig Wright/Ver and they split the coin three ways and dump each others chain.
...in other words it's totally stable.

I think you need to go back and read my second sentence. The whole point of that sentence was to point out that incentives aren't just aligned, but too aligned, aligned to the extent of it being a fault. The biggest holders are also the biggest miners. 
You can be a POW miner just for profit from the mining process. There's incentives, not obligations.
@_date: 2018-08-17 08:39:01
Is this just some reverse psychology? "Please no SEC, don't make us rich"
@_date: 2018-08-23 06:14:56
The concept of POW feels like some kind of new age Ponzi scheme. All the incentives become too aligned and too centralized.
The irony is if you try to hardfork to a hybrid or POS system then due to the high barrier of entry (1000ETH minimum for Casper) you lock out a huge number of miners who could not benefit from the system. How will you convince them to support the new chain? i.e you'll have another long lasting fork.
So, just to clarify shitcoincash (Bcash) come november will have CraigCoin, JihanCoin and BU's Bcash Original....and later down the line there may well be NewJihanCoin too. Jihan managed to convince idiots like u/memorydealers that he was really smart, but seriously, this is hilarious.

Ok, so I provided sources to *everything* I said above. Lets see you back up what you're saying:-


1.) Provide your source for China successfully using the CNY to trade oil with from more than 10 years ago (even though you say "more than half a century") (this will debase USD as the reserve currency!!!)
2.) Provide your source for the EU leaders calling for the creation of a new financial system and exclude USA from more than 10 years ago (This will debase USD as the reserve currency!!!)
3.) Provide your source showing Turkey buying Russian weapons from more than 10 years ago.
The dollar has only even been a global reserve currency for a *single* generation. You're talking like it has some kind of historic significance, it doesn't. In 1970 it stopped being backed by Gold. The whole system is new, that's what you don't appreciate. Half a century? Fiat currency didn't EXIST half a century ago. To understand Bitcoin you have to have a decent understanding of the present financial system and its history and that you clearly lack.

Are you serious? He's complaining that although miners are meant to be able to lead Bitcoin's development by design that it doesn't work in practice. Because it's actually holders of the coin who get to decide the validity of the fork. This is the basis for his argument for using POS as well as POW.
It was really freaking obvious what he is saying. I don't know how you're struggling to interpret straight forward and direct English.

"About 56 percent of Bitcoin Cash is controlled by 67 wallets not located on exchanges" - Jesus christ, could it be worse? 
  When you consider Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, Craig Wright, Calvin Ayre and some of Jihans friends I have literally no doubt these **67** wallets belong ~~almost~~ *entirely* to these people. I own more than 10 wallets and I definitely don't have anywhere near the number of coins these guys have. Is it starting to make sense to Bcash shills why everyone thinks Bcash is a shitcoin yet?

This is going to be fucking hilarious.
Ver will call 128mb block Bitcoin Cash with the upgrades BCH on his exchange, but Calvin Ayre/Craig will convince their exchange owners to call their 128mb block Bitcoin Cash WITHOUT the upgrades BCH. There will be a split between the exchanges depending on which they believe is to be rightfully called BCH.
So you won't be able to send BCH into or out of literally any wallet until you research what that individual wallet had named each version of the coin.
Do you get what I mean?

You're confidence is misplaced, you're talking to a former professional Forex trader. Do you really think you can teach me about global finance when I made my living in these markets?
I gave you the information in the first post, but you're too obnoxious to consider it, instead brushing it off as a conspiracy theory? The stability of the global markets depend on the petro-dollar, which is being targeted by Russia, Iran, China and potentially Turkey right now. 
Turkey is now buying weapons from Russia and traditionally USA would crush a Country with war or sanctions, but they can't do either without destroying global stability - this is a precedent ( Meanwhile China is convincing Countries to trade oil for CNY.
These things are the real reasons behind USA's defensive behavior in the new trade wars.  But even the EU recognizes their play and will counter it with a financial system OUTSIDE of the US's control. (
Clearly you had no idea any of this was happening, are you inside the USA?  Embarrassingly ignorant: "The US military backs the dollar so it will never be pushed over", hah.

Maybe you're not but everyone else *is*. My post is presently -8*. When I elaborated and provided substantial evidence I was sent a parody song about wearing tin foil hats and insulted/mocked multiple times. 
I never said anything about killing the USD, I made an argument for significant change in global finance. I didn't even say this change would shift towards Bitcoin, the implication is that a large change in global finance makes the concept of new financial systems more realistic to the general population. At that point Bitcoin doesn't look so out of place as is does to the less informed right now.

When you talk about the concept of value, you have to consider its uses. Value is determined only by what people are prepared to pay for something. But the reason they're prepared to pay anything is determined by its use to them.
If someone doesn't think Bitcoin has any unique use, I would immediately know they don't know anything about Bitcoin. So commenting at all makes them an idiot.
Tell me, do you think Bitcoin has any unique use cases?

It was nicely written up to the premise of 51% attacking, that's just a nonsense. Undermining the concept of mining security is literally the last thing a miner would do. The entire premise of Crypto is built around mining being a good way to secure a chain. Bitcoin Gold got 51%'d and no one was bothered, because it wasn't that secure, but if BITCOIN could be then the whole premise of Crypto is mooted.

The exchanges in China are banned, so if you send it to them they can't cash it out. It's different in Hong Kong though, so if they have connections there, or can travel there to set up an account it would be fine.

Actually, I knew you would respond in this way. Taking offense on someone else's behalf, calling someone narrow minded and pretending that isn't intended as an insult, then telling them you love them - it's all the hallmarks of someone trying to wind someone else up. This response was predictable because it is the next thing a troll would say. The next thing is to pretend it's all innocent. You're like a level 1 at this whole deal.

This video is not accurate at all, its a sensationalist take on the situation and does not represent reality accurately.
There are multiple options available to re-stabilize the Turkish Economy, contrary to what is stated in the video.
A simple statement from a Government official that they're changing their stance on interest rates would probably halt the decline.
Releasing the Pastor would possibly halt the decline.
Seeking assistance from the IMF would halt the decline.
Confirming funding from Europe/China/Russia would halt the decline.
Coming to an agreement with the US on various issues would help halt the decline.
Doing multiple ones from the list above, then actually increasing the rates and providing a framework to raise exports while slowing down the economy would certainly strengthen the Lira back to *at least* 4 or 5.
So as aforementioned, sensationalist video departed from reality.
However, buy Bitcoin, the World economy is going to struggle over the next few years - thanks Trump.

I mean Jihan Wu's vision for Bcash, Craig Wright's vision for Bcash and BU's vision to compromise with these two uncompromising parties. So there will be JihanCoin, CraigCoin and Bitcoin Cash Original come November.
All three will be fighting to be the real "Bitcoin Cash" while also fighting to be the "real Bitcoin". 
Meanwhile Jihan owns more Bcash than even Satoshi and 60% of all Bcash coins are owned by like 50 wallets (OUTSIDE of exchanges) and there is a billionaire on 2 of the 3 sides waiting to dump their coins to kill off their competition.
This is more obviously a scam than Bitconnect for gods sake. But there's always a small group of people stupid enough to be taken in.

This comment was value valuable for me, it is what I have suspected all the way down. i.e once the price returns to 20k USD a lot of people in the mainstream will be forced to change their opinion. This is why I have been counting on the earliest proper technical signal up (break of roughly 9k USD presently) instigating the run relatively quickly.
At what price was Bitcoin when you first looked into it properly?
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:10:58
Nothing religious about it. As it stands Bitcoin and Ethereum and the only ones to take seriously. The only reason the others are above a single dollar was because of the idea they could usurp Bitcoin and make the buyer money. Fools errand long term.

@_date: 2018-08-22 12:07:49
Fascinating. So in practicality this that you've outlined above is a purchase through Lightning using Monero to a shop that accepts Bitcoin payments through lightning.
The only bit that I don't get is who are the people who sit there ready and waiting to happily, without express consent, exchange their Bitcoin for Monero and why they do this?
The only logic I could see would be because they get some kind of fee for this? They would then sell their Monero for more Bitcoin on a normal exchange? So their profit margins would have to be prohibitively large initially?
Alternatively its exchanges themselves doing this, but that would go against their KYC policies, so they couldn't offer this.
Am I misunderstanding something again?
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:44:08


This is what you said. You're saying the points I made have been made for more than 50 years.

@_date: 2018-08-28 14:48:55
I think I agree with aspects of what you're saying. But I personally see Bitcoin as gold 2.0, it's a hedge against present financial systems, in times of war or an economic collapse i.e capital controls its literally the **only** thing you'll be able to remove from the Country. Now if you don't really have much you won't have a use for that, but if you're pretty wealthy you *always* need a way to hide or take wealth out the Country.
I'm also aware of various developments within Bitcoin itself which mean that it will raise in value quite dramatically again over the next 10 months.
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:45:36

So the miners are committed to their project due to this and they have no business selling things cheaper than the cost, so obviously they hold. Once the market settles their (miners) cutting of the supply has an obvious affect of raising the price.
But if the miners own their facility they could just quit immediately and sell everything, their building/fire their employees/sell all their mining equipment right away as soon as the price dips below their level of profitability. That sounds more realistic than hodling. The OP seems right.
@_date: 2018-06-15 11:44:56
Payments cost more than what? Visa? Ok, does it cost the merchant in that same transaction more or less with Bitcoin? 
Bitcoin is cheaper and easier to set up, faster to set up too and has a massively faster settlement for the merchant. If more people used Bitcoin I don't think any merchant in the world would choose not to accept it.

A short is an active trade, the further price falls from your opening point the more money you make.

A broker/exchange will close your trade at the point you have no money left in your account, i.e you have lost all the money in  your account.
However, in some instances there are flash crashes where a stop loss isn't triggered fast enough or the trade cannot be closed fast enough by the broker and an account goes negative.
Maybe you're away of this but I'm telling anyone that is interested and also reading.

Almost, a short is a bet the price will go down. There is no time or target inherent to a "short". You can arbitrarily set this as part of a trading strategy though.


No, you lose depending on where you cut your losses. There can be no limit to this. It's even possible to lose more than you even have in your account. Then you owe the trading desk. Although, this is quite rare.


A trade is profitable where your assumption (up or down) is correct and then the trade is closed while you are correct.
