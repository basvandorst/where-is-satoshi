Its very obvious a lot of entrenched financial and political interests are very concerned. They are slowly realizing that they are losing control and trust. 
Today,  it's just a small car... But this is just the beginning.

Well said.  Seriously sick of these us vs them posts suggesting we've got them rattled.  Newsflash... They really don't give a shit

I work in SEO and regularly use a tool called Ahrefs that among other things, can calculate (at a pretty decent rate of accuracy) the amount of traffic a website gets.
With google and Facebook recently allowing ads again, I thought I'd just check to see if it's had much of an impact on the main exchange volumes.
Coinbase visitor volume has gone insane the past 10 days. From around 2MM views to 3.1MM and still rising...and that's just organic traffic. I can't see how well their paid traffic is doing, but assume it's gone crazy too. Obviously the paid traffic is going to have an effect on the organic.
Checked the other exchanges too - all going up quite a bit too, but not to the same extent of coinbase. so you can't argue that it's people moving from other exchanges to cb.
So yeah...they've managed to increase their traffic by 1/3 in about 10 days....yet crypto still tanks - wtf?!?

yeah..again. strange. December 2017 saw no extra traffic. I stand by ahrefs tho. Whilst not infallible - it's by far the most accurate tool out there. It may be off by as much as 10% in rare circumstances, but a 33% rise in 10 days - seems odd and not something I can see them getting that wrong. And as I say, other exchanges are getting similar gains over the past 10 days too. Bitmex just did 20%, binance about 15%

I actually cross posted this on r/ethtrader where someone pointed out that it's most likely panic sellers logging in en-mass to sell... which given the recent price action is a very reasonable assumption. 
But today, I thought about it some more. As you can see from the chart above on all the other mass panic sells we've had this year (which were arguably even more horrendous than this one so far) the coinbase traffic didn't even flutter. 
Another reason was ETC sellers moving their ETC to coinbase wallets to sell now that CB are opening to trade...but I don't think this would explain an extra 100K in traffic, let alone 1Million.
Someone else made a very valid point too - There's simply no way on earth this could be masses of people deciding now (in the middle of a massive bear market) is a great time to buy into crypto. Parabolic moves are always at the top, when things are going well and everyone has that fear of missing out.  Clever and considered buy ins don't happen like this.
I still have no clue what's causing it!
