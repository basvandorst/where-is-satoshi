Not a big problem. Moreover, you don't need to have all your coins there.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:14:17


Yes, you have to do that, but if you do have 51% of hashing power, in my understanding - please correct me if I am wrong - you have &gt;25% chance to do that, which is not "barely likely". (0.5*0.5 - you can mine the first block with false transaction as likely as others to mine something else, and then you also have 51% chance to surpass them in the next block, and then those 49% will have trouble to catching up the attacker).
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:22:55
heh thanks. I do C++ for a living, so when I am bored I am studying the bitcoin source code or run a debug session and watch what is going on. ;)
@_date: 2014-01-02 23:19:31
Yes, it is normal. Assuming they own 25% of hashing power, this happens with a probability of around 0.02% (0.25 power 6), which, if I computed correctly, should happen about once per month. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 14:26:18
This was discussed to death here - it's difficult to paint a complete picture of the consequence of the 51% attack, but they certainly can't do whatever they want. You certainly can't stole other people money or create new money outside of mining. You can double-spend, or stop certain transactions.
But this would be very quickly spotted, and then all would depend on what the attacker would do next. But it's hard to predict how it would develop, but probably the BTC price would go down.
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:52:04
It is wrong, since if you have 51% of hashpower, you will also successfully do the confirmations of the wrong transaction, if you want to - those confirmations are based on "majority votes".
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:07:20

Butthurt isnt the correct word - I will loose my own money and time by switching to android, since i will have not only to buy the hardware, but also to research the app store and evaluate and buy the apps I need to use. Apple will not refund me the then useless apps I bought. So my complaining is justified - they have created more loss to me that I created to them by complaining. I feel complaining about wrong behavior of companies should be done. New potential customers also should be warned about companies like apple and potential risk they face. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:57:01
We should also clarify, that they probably do not have 42% of hashing power. The blockchain.info graph just states the number of mined block in the last 24 hours, doesn't it? So there are statistical fluctuations, so sometimes you will have "luck" and mine more, and other days you will mine less.
As I see it, ghash.io has their own hardware which they are leasing through the cex.io service, and then there are also external miners who are mining through them. Now the question is, how big is this second group of external miners, and if they will be so stupid to keep mining there even if ghash.io will really approach 51% in hashpower (this IMHO is not imminent yet - but of course could happen).
@_date: 2014-01-15 09:10:56
I also heard from someone, that some ASIC miners are pre-configured to connect to ghash.io. So it is very well possible that someone just bought a few asics, plugs them in and doesn't care about what is being done in the background.

First of all, it was a service accepting 0 confirmation transactions, something not recommended.

It's because that some other pools are not merge-mining namecoins.
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:06:03
I think no. I suppose that at the beginning they sold all that GH/s, and now people are just trading them between themselves. Or if they didn't sell everything, they mine for themselves. But the machines are still running, what would be the point of switching them off?

Great start, congrats. Just don't think you missed the boat, you are still ahead of the game. I suggest to study the bitcoin more, that way you can build up your confidence in this promising technology.
@_date: 2014-01-14 08:33:58
Exactly. Lot's of people do not own bitcoins, because they haven't mine them and haven't buy them. It's not that the bitcoin network promotes certain kind of distribution.
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:50:19
Please be more specific. You can send bitcoin from one *address* to another *address*. You can't send bitcoins to "wallet", nor to "account".

But we are talking about double-spend here. If the attacker gets his "dishonest" transaction confirmed, the second transaction will be dropped.

Mtgox was wrong, we know it, but from the opposite perspective, shouldnt the btc developers be more proactive with helping application developers?
Ok, the issue was described in a wiki, but the coder might not be aware of that... He supposed the txid doesnt change, which is quite understandable; and the warning is only in the wiki page with some unguessable name. I think this is a failure of the whole btc devs community, not that poor gox coder. They should provide updated protocol doc, not just a so-called "reference implementation". 
Ok now just downvote me..,

@_date: 2014-02-01 17:07:54
No, i didnt mean cheating. 
Sorry i dont understand why what you are describing is a completely random number. What is being done with the hash?
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:34:42
It's not coincidence, but statistically perfectly possible. Last time I did some calculation, and for example if a pool has 25% hashpower, it can mine 6 blocks in succession with probability around 0.02%.... this seems like very small, but if you take the number of blocks, this should happen around once per month. Simply, if someone has for example 38% of hashpower, it is within normal statistical distribution, that it will mine 42% some day, and 32% some other way. (But of course, I don't want to trivialize the whole issue, which might very soon become serious). I just wanted to say that mined blocks is not the same as hashing power.
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:51:30
Not necessarily - if everyone will go this route, one big pool can take over, and then the price will not go to 1M.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:04:54
Wait, this advice is only correct if the mining machines are not running if nobody buys its GHs via cex.io, but I think it is not true. I suppose all those machines are still mining, but you can rent some part of them, and then they earn even more for cex.io. ;-)
I would also like to mention, that not everyone loses money on cex.io - because you can buy GHs, that will mine something, and then you can sell those GHs back...and the price is not always going down! Basically you can do intraday trading with GHs and be profitable when you know what are you doing.
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:47:42
You don't need to send the transaction only through the wallet. You can manufacture it "manually" and send it directly to the network.

What if the random number generator is not random enough? If it is 100% random, then I agree with you. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:54:13
People, if ghash.io has 25% of mining power, this will occur with the probability of 0.02%, which means about once per month.
@_date: 2014-01-15 09:09:15

@_date: 2014-01-14 13:31:25
I heard other day, that there are some ASIC manufacturers, who are configuring the machines in a way, that they automatically connect to ghash.io. So I suppose there are a lot of miners, who just buy the machine and plugs it, and they are mining in ghash.io. I suppose there are many external miners there, making it more than 5%.
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:46:47
To clarify it: what I described is just one type of attack, which Bitcoin wiki calls "brute for attack" -&gt; 
With 51% of hashing power, you can also do other types of attacks.

Or you can try until you succeed, can't you? You are not penalized by the network if you tried to double-spend and failed. But of course someone could notice and make it public.

But you sold it to someone else, who mines with them...
@_date: 2014-01-15 14:29:57
This will not work, due to some limitation imposed in the protocol - you can't publish too many subsequent blocks at once. I explained it in this comment:
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:20:05
Imho dogecoin is litecoin with better scrypt parameters - shorter block time and larger number of coins. 
But I feel you are completely ignoring the marketing innovation doge bought. Dogecoin has far the best marketing among all crypto and you are not giving any credit to them for that. 
Moreover, bitcoin is opensource so it is completelly fine, legal and ethical to copy the source. You are suggesting like it was something questionable... 
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:26:14
You are right they didnt bring technology inovation, but they did bring marketing inovation - introducing non-geeks to crypto, new members acquisition, cultivating PR... those are real advancements btc and ltc can learn from. Lets be honest here - as much as I like btc and give them credit to bring this wonderful tech to us, its marketing is rather amateurish for the most part... 
@_date: 2014-01-03 00:37:32
If someone can compute private key from public key, he doesnt need to wait for anything, he can just transfer btc from that address to his own, once he computes that private key, which he then uses to sign such transaction. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:19:42


What is that?


That will make your paper wallet useless. Do you understand the concept of "cold storage"? 


In that case you will not lose your coins. But the word "leave" is misleading, since you can't leave coins there - always the whole sum is transferred, but you can transfer the change back to you to the same address. That is usually done with the wallet software.
To sum it up: If you want to have a cold storage and also send smaller sums from it, you should use Armory client installed on the computer, which will never go online. There currently isn't any other recommended way to achieve that - if you don't want to unintentionally losing your money by not exactly knowing what you are doing.
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:27:14
Can you describe how the withdraw (send) feature works? Does it require some manual action on your side?
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:48:48
But what would they gain by doing it? It would be quickly discovered and the bitcoin price could go down as a consequence, making them losses.
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:39:48
In short-term, it is. GHash.io also has their own hardware, but if their externals miners will leave, that will decrease their overall hash rate.
But I agree with you that in the long term, it is not going to work when we will need to "order" the miners to do or not do something. Miners should behave according to their own economic interest, and that is how this is supposed to work. But the miners also need to understand, that if the hashpower would approach 50%, that might decrease the investor's trust in bitcoin, rendering the price of bitcoin to go down or stagnate, and that already isn't in their interest.
@_date: 2014-02-01 16:45:39
Could the bot take an advantage of the non-randomness of the random generator? Or are the numbers there completely random?

Edmund, this looks very promising, finally we are starting to see a more complex bitcoin script capabilities to be used in a real application.
One question: What if the "reality data" API provides false data, due to human error or accidental hiccup? The transaction can't be reversed once certain outcome is comfirmed...
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:25:21
Question: How can blockchain.info know, how much hashing power there is behind each pool? Aren't those numbers just mined blocks? Because taking statistical variance into account, it's natural that you mine different number of blocks each day.
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:17:25


If their recent press release is correct, 45% is their own, 55% are external miners.
@_date: 2014-01-03 08:36:38
Yes they would have to double spend and then hit that probability. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:23:21

Just a fantasizing (don't know if they could do that): 
1) Invalidate the proof-of-work concept - could immediately mine the block
2) Compute the valid private key from the public key, and the developers will not manage to react quickly enough to replace the sha-2 with something else.
But please don't take my words too seriously, it's just a brainstorming. ;-)

How you theory explains the fact, that Chinese gov also banned exchanges of virtual currencies from MMORPG games?
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:28:10
No. There isn't a term "block difficulty". The network just accepts the longest blockchain - the longest sequence of mined blocks.  
You can change the block from yesterday, but them you will have to mine all the blocks coming after than one, so your falsified blockchain will be longer than the current one. But, the actual mining difficulty ensures, that mining just one block takes around 10 mins for the whole network! How would you mine so much blocks so quickly, when you have only part of the hashing power of the whole network. That chance is ridiculously small. 
If you really want to understand how it works, i suggest to study the Hashcash algorithm first, and then the concept "proof of work" used in bitcoin. Then it should be more clear. :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:44:10
But if you email the private key to yourself, and for example you encrypted it with some known software, you have to ensure that your computer is not compromised, so nobody has access to your email and didn't capture the keystrokes when you typed your passwords. To have a total peace of mind, I still believe your private key should be kept offline during the whole "life" of the wallet.

The technology is still pretty young. This is solvable over time by improving the wallet clients or introducing better hardware/paper wallets.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:38:07
The issue is, that the altcoins somehow compete with each other; for example, the ltc difficulty went down, since some miners moved to doge. And this is a problem for ltc, since investors and traders might interpret it as losing popularity; switching to other crypto is trivial, so maybe this is making some ppl nervous. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:37:44
Ok, but how will you fund people like fire fighters, for example? Or judges? Will the voluntary contributions be sufficient, or should the government also do mining?

A block chain is a transaction database shared by all nodes participating in a system based on the Bitcoin protocol. A full copy of a currency's block chain contains every transaction ever executed in the currency. With this information, one can find out how much value belonged to each address at any point in history. 
Blockchain can't be exhausted. You mean that there will be no new bitcoins generated? Then, they will be only get passed from one address to another... they will circulate between people.


No, no, no, no and no. They are not stored there, they are stored in the Bitcoin network. On your harddisk is only the so-called wallet, which is a set of addresses, pointing to the Bitcoin network, where are the bitcoins themselves.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:01:40
I use it on hidden paper wallet. If I wanted to store it online, I would probably add another layer, like password protected zip or small truecrypt volume. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:13:00
Yes. Who has the private key, has access to the money from that address.
I would personally recommend to use wallet at bitaddress.org, tab "Paper Wallet", and check "BIP38 Encrypt". This will print the wallet with private key encrypted with your password. Then, when you import the key to blockchain.info, it will ask for password. 
Obviously, you can't forget it, but I think it is better than unencrypted private key.
Also, it is better to create the wallet on a computer, which is not connected to the internet. Or, even better, switch off internet, boot linux from usb key, and create the paper wallet from there. This way, there is not a chance that the private key was ever on a machine connected to the internet.

My personal stance is, that Bitcoin is first of all about freedom. He is free to make a profit with Bitcoin, it's not that Bitcoin network discourages it. If he wants to "generate cash", you can tell him that he can buy BTC on the exchange, and then sell it when the price goes up, and then withdraw the USD balance - he would generate (USD) cash then.

I remember two bigger aha moments:
1) I bought a few deci-BTC's to find out what the hype is all about, subscribed to a few services like BTC exchanges etc., and sent some BTC amounts to each one. Then, I discovered, that I do not need to have some "central wallet" to send some BTC sum somewhere, and then back when I no longer need it there, but I can also freely move any amount of BTC from one online wallet to another, transferring the value very quickly however I need. I was quite astonished when I realized how valuable this is, and how much better this is than the current monetary system.
2) I visited a local bitcoin summit, and there I met a guy who told me about his friend, who runs the btc mining farm, but he doesn't run it to be profitable with the mining, but he does it to support the bitcoin network and couldn't care less about the ROI. Then I got it - people who invested into BTC are not only speculators who wants to make quick money and then exit until the so-called "bubble" burst (as the mainstream media would like us to believe), but there is a lot of people who are really invested in this cryptocurrency thing, and will use all their powers to keep going until it prevails. When I saw those people, their enthusiasm backed with rational understanding of the technology behind it, it occurred to me that it will be very very hard to knock down this whole thing, very difficult to stop it.

Not bad, but the weak point is, that if your computer is already compromised, theoretically there could be some malware which already have read your keys and passwords, and sends it later away when you again connect to the internet.
It would be better to do it on some other laptop, which you will not again connect to the internet ever, or create a bootable usb stick with linux a do it there.
But what is even more important, be sure to try the whole process with some small amount of money - I mean also the reverse step, getting the money out of it. 
Also, I hope you know that when you will withdraw your money back, you should withdraw the whole balance, else the rest of your money could become un-recoverable.
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:03:26
Might I ask you about the sustainability of the mining: When BTC become much more widespread and the number of transactions will rapidly increase, how will be ensured that the mining is still profitable and people will want to continue their mining indefinitely?

Yes I am already reading the code. It looks neat, written in good C++, there just isn't that much comments, and also the design documents with UML diagrams are missing. (But I come from the corporate closed-source world, maybe UML is not popular in open-source, I don't know).

Who is this Barry Silbert guy? How much can we believe him?

Probably. But if that would happen (fall of USD), they would need to solve much more pressing, unforeseeable consequences. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:40:48
Because they are legally required to do so.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:30:06
Ok, no problem. As I see it, I own Bitcoin and can change it to government-backed currency, and also use it to pay for some goods or services. In practical sense, this seems to me very similar to currency.
Regarding the proof-of-burned-natural-resources, you are right, Bitcoin uses such electricity to operate, he needs it to work. But as I understand it, it doesn't need more and more energy to function - difficulty rises only because there are more and more mining hardware added to the network. But over time, it might cause the electricity prices to go up, and then it will become un-profitable for some miners, so they will stop running their hardware. It's not true that the system needs more and more electricity. Also, future ASICs can be made more energy efficient.

I am more used to "real" comments, like the programmer explain concepts behind the code. But I am also guilty of not doing it as often as I should.
Where I work we use UML, as an illustrations used in design documents. They can give good overview about what the code does, when done correctly. Especially the sequence diagrams - it is quicker to see the workflow in a diagram than to reconstruct it from the source code.

Legit. Worked for me about a week ago, was able to withdraw. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:57:33
He didn't specify, if he means to gain them fraudulently or honestly. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:09:05


Yes, that's the way to do it.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:24:51
I use Coinbits for actual graphs, alerts and news bits, Blockchain app as a hot wallet, and Bitcoin Bleep for quick price check. Only thing I would miss is a trading app, if I would be day trader. What else is missing? I am quite fine with iPhone as a bitcoiner.
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:04:12
Please what is the state of bitcoin apps for windows phone? (I personally dont like android that much)
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:59:15
Question (I don't know the answer): But if only the little guys would continue to mine, will that be enough to sustain the whole network? Because the mining also serves to validate the transactions and keeps the whole system running.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:20:31
But why do you buy them? Just asking...what if the price of BTC will go up, but the price of namecoin and primecoin will not? Then you will lose part of your money. I am just curious to learn how you arrived to the conclusion that this is a good investment nowadays.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:52:29
From another perspective, if something this big and disruptive suddenly pops up, like the bitcoin technology, it would be really strange if nobody objected. So the articles like Krugmans are a good sign that this is something significant, otherwise he wouldn't care. But I think LoveMeSumBTC is right, I would just let it be and go on with our things instead. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:04:50


How did you come to this conclusion? And the second? And the third?
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:08:45
You can be (a little) worried. Although this could be theoretically possible if you specified 0.00 transaction fee.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:21:43


No one knows. Waiting sounds like a good strategy, unless the price will never in the future get lower than today. 


No. It could be worth it, if you have free electricity and if you already own that computer. Otherwise, you will gain more if you just buy BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:14:07
His remark could be interpreted in a way, that there are people who have no favorite free office suite.
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:21:53
Yes, that's right. It would be even better to download the site from the github ( and check it's integrity. Or what would you suggest?
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:52:19
My current understanding is, that we need at least two, just for hedging purposes. If something unexpected would happen to BTC, it would be good to move part of the value to other crypto. I wish at least LTC would survive (apart from BTC of course).
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:47:40
You are right, this has to go. But still, we should distinguish, whether it is a characteristic of the BTC community, or just a few people trolling. 
I remember when I attended one BTC festival (in real life), and there were a lot of lively discussions among enthusiasts regarding what alternative currencies to mine, which ones could succeed, etc. I just didn't notice any hostile attitude towards altcoins, which you are describing. So it very well could be just some individuals are trolling or have some ulterior motives.
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:19:42
Good idea, but the website can also be theoretically hacked from backend.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:57:51
The Armory is fine. But still, I wouldn't have a complete peace of mind with this solution, because there is still a slim chance that you have some malware or virus, or something which could steal the file and the keystrokes when you typed the password, and then you are screwed. I am not saying that this is easy to do, but not impossible.
The ultimate solution, IMHO, is that the majority of your coins will be in the cold storage, which means, that the private key was not present on a computer which was or will be on the internet. To achieve this, you can have Armory installed on a dedicated netbook, which is never online, or you can boot linux from an usb drive and create paper wallet (on the offline computer, for example you switch off wifi).
But for smaller amounts, like for everyday use, almost any popular program is good enough, if you do backup and use good password.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:35:00
You are right, but what can we do with people who write for money stuff like "...bitcoin, which is little more than some made-up digits on a computer server..."  ;-) He is either trolling, or doesn't have a clue, or have some malicious intentions.
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:02:29
Someone doesnt have a freedom to develop for example an application for bitcoin trading, and as a consequence I dont have a freedom to properly manage my btc savings on my iphone which they sold me.

@_date: 2013-12-16 09:02:24
How do you guys see the problem of splits, like the one which happened in March? Because the problem Bitcoin has to solve is more general, IMHO: The original Byzantine Generals problem supposed, that the general's agenda doesn't change over time: majority of them are honest, minority are traitors, and the majority should coordinate, without knowing who is the traitor.
But in Bitcoin case, the general's characteristics are incrementally changing over time (new versions of the software are being deployed to all nodes). Potentially, there could be a split or hostile takeover in this scenario, which is beyond the scope of the original Byzantine Generals Problem. Did Bitcoin solved this issue as well?
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:34:45
Actually, I still believe I understand what is a cold storage. It means that the private key was generated on a computer not connected to the internet, and it doesnt exist on any computer connected to the internet. It is always offline, right?
But even in this case, you can have online wallet... The service can give you, for example, a pool of addresses, and hide them in UI, and some od them will have private keys in company's cold storage.  
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:40:21
Hm, but when you look up your public address, do you see the correct balance on blockchain.info? How can you have part of the funds on cold storage and part on hot storage? 
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:38:56
Yes I did read it. So far, the most difficult for me was to understand the proof of work concept, that took me about half a Saturday to really understand. :) 
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:13:34
Hm, but what if that bridge is really necessary for people in one village, but dont have enough voting power?
Or to come up with more extreme case, some people are terminally ill, and a lot of money must be spend to keep them alive. What if there will be voting regarding of we want to "fund" them, but only their families and a few kind-hearted people will vote for it? Then we just let them die?
So I now understand what you mean, but the whole concept seems rather risky to me. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:14:04
No, hodl. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 12:11:48
Both can be true. She cares for him, and at the same time, doesn't understand what is at stake here. It is very well possible, that in a few months, when the Wall Street capital will flow into bitcoin, it will not be possible to buy BTC for such a small price like it is now in December. But that's just my understanding, of course.
But maybe it isn't mostly about bitcoin, and she just doesn't like that he is choosing a less paying job. ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:59:06
Mostly. Or they are just buying them, anticipating that they will be used more and more in the future, so they can pre-buy at lower price, comparing to 2014 when it is very likely to increase.
You can look at it as a transitional phase, until BTC is more spread. Basically, Bitcoin is optional, you don't have to use it over paypal, in most cases paypal is more convenient nowadays. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:49:42
I suppose it was always there, but the trick is, that it is not in results when you search "bitcoin". They probably don't want people to discover it... ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:40:26
But do you think currency is useful? And do you think Bitcoin can be used as a currency? (at least in the future). Isn't then Bitcoin useful? And if it is, the energy is not wasted, it is used to support something useful.
How else would you solve the double-spending problem in the decentralized currency running on P2P network?
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:00:12
And what happens when you want to withdraw the bitcoins or send them somewhere? (I am not their customer). 
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:12:44
As someone said, you can use  to check balance.
Anyway, my advice would be, never do such a thing anymore. What if you friend has some malware or keylogger installed, and he even doesn't know about it? If your keystrokes (when you typed a password) and wallet file is stolen, you might be in trouble.
I am a little bit paranoid myself, so I even don't tell anyone that I have something like a wallet on my PC, not to mention moving it to someone.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:34:58


But if it is already compromised, the malware can catch the password by keylogging and send it to the virus creator.


You are not paranoid, this is actually the correct way to do it. Other possibility is to have bootable USB stick with Linux.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:59:19
But is this a rational stance, when there is a reasonable expectation that their value will increase in a few years, if not months? I am also buying (but only spending spare money on it).
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:18:40
I doubt most people would be such careless. ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:49:10
Ok, but I believe that even within this context, my firefighters question is still valid.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:17:42
I am also sorry for that guy loss, but I can't agree with your analogy. He was paying a small amount DIRECTLY FROM BRAINWALLET! That's a total hack and is also warned against in a wiki. It's not at all analogous to standard bank wire. It's not related to bitcoin security, he was just doing workaround without knowing how it works.
OP: I hope you will recover some of your loses!
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:23:26
What you did is that you created local encrypted wallet, but this is not a cold-storage.
Please read this:
Cold storage means, that your private key is not stored online, and preferably, was never on a computer which is connected to the internet. You can achieve this by creating a wallet on a computer not connected to the Internet. I know two ways how you can do that: by creating so-called paper wallet, or by using the Armory client in an offline mode.
Your method is rather safe, buy it assumes that you don't have a malware which can access your computer and log your keystrokes (when you typed a password).
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:11:21
It is like you described.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:46:52
That's what I was thinking about as well. But the unsolved issue is how will we distribute voting rights without a central authority? It's like you would need to give one "voting bitcoin" to each adult citizen, and then he or she can spend it to vote. But how to achieve that?
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:06:46
Someone downvoted you, but you are correct.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:10:12
So for example when you have btc on exchange, like btc-e, that is basically a hot wallet?
I am asking because for example, someone said that in just-dice.com, only certain amount of btc is in the hot storage and main part is in cold one. 
I have read all answers, but I am still not convinced that it can't be implemented. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:25:14
Yes, you send btc to the public address printed on your paper wallet.
If you want to get them back, you import both public and private keys to some wallet client, and get them. You will need to transfer the whole sum to another address. 
I would highly recommend to try all those steps with some small amount of money. If it works as expected, then you create another paper wallet and move the whole sum there. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:44:38
Do you also want to periodically withdraw coins from that wallet, or only store them for a longer time?
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:34:26
I don't feel it yet. I can send and receive BTCs via BlockChain app, use Coinbits for quick news and prices and alarms, and Bitcoin Bleep to quickly check mtgox price.
I can't trade via app, but I can live with that for now.
What exactly are you missing? (serious question, I am not trolling).
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:51:20
BTC-e has one of the lowest BTC price.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:41:58


Your wallet contains several so-called addresses, and each address has certain amount of bitcoins in it. But those amounts are maintained by the bitcoin network, not by your local wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:13:35
Define "controlled". 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:16:56
I would need to think more whether I would like to pay for such a service, but it sounds interesting. But the third point is unclear:


Really? And will you hold the promise, when, for example, I suddenly transfer 1000 additional BTC's there? 


Not exactly. You can create a paper wallet on bitaddress.org, where the private key is encrypted with BIP38 algo. So the thief will still need to have a password, which is not the same as having money under the mattress.
