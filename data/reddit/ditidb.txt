I'm sorry bitcoin is up how much from jan 17?  Fuckers keep forgetting.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:47:39
Wallstreet crawled all up in it,  bitcoin is done son.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:26:42
If lightning has bad PR it will harm bitcoin which will harm all crypto.  Wait for it to be ready.  I don't want your risk tolerance to harm me.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:28:19
damn i thought LN was gonna be cheaper fees than bcash
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:55:56
With the lightening network if i understand correctly I have to send the btc to myself in the contract and then as I make purchases we revise the contract to show the appropriate amount belonging to the merchant?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:12:39
The crytpo community seriously needs to stop the infighting.    Am I the only one  who sees the blatant attacks from big bank controlled governments pilling up?
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:28:49
If by 'the same they were in the beg dec/nov' you mean 100-200k less and falling, and by 'when there was no spam' you mean when people actually used bitcoin, and by 'fuck off' you mean leave this cancerous community to their blind denial then SURE!
See I don't really care if bitcoin is on top or bitcoin cash is on top,  I don't really care as long as I have a viable alternative to fiat.  So I'm not going to fanboy out and live in denial, lie, and flame people who disagree with me.  I'm going to deal in the facts and try to support crypto as a whole.  People like you are the reason this project will fail if it continues in the direction it's headed.

well then he should have specified the ledger and not bitcoin, but that's not what he said now is it
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:37:23
now if he only knew what immutable meant we'd be going somewhere.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:08:01
I think you need to work on your feels
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:16:08
Immutable means something can't be changed.  Bitcoin can be changed.  Bitcoin is not immutable.  Pierre Rochard is a dumbbitch.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:58:54
Really? Cuz Satoshi didn't really think everyone should be running a full node.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:53:16
lol ok I think we're done, pretty apparent you only talk out of your ass.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:29:54
Don't think for one second that the futures market isn't manipulating btc price.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:00:18
the IRS considers it 'not real property' and that's all you need to know for now.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:52:16
you should definitely print it out.  I have about 750 transaction from the past two weeks alone and I will absolutely be printing and delivering my returns in person.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:34:10
I think i was making a joke and then you decided to nitpick my comment.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:25:57
Fees tend to go down when people stop making transactions
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:33:19
I make better returns than bitcoin does and that's all you need to know.
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:48:36
Down to 220k from 490k so actually it's closer to 60% fewer transactions.  Pulled directly from the arse of bitinfocharts.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:49:22
BTC or BCH either way crypto wins,  save your fight for big banks
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:12:21
I mine and diversify,  keep acting like you know the score.  fucktards like you are why core will fail.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:13:00
This is true but if we push a system that isn't ready it will only get worse.
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:45:10
I'm wondering, by 'a bit ago' you mean over a month ago when bitcoin was at 19k, and by 'mem pool spam ended' you mean fewer transactions due to lack of public interest now that bitcoin has dipped almost 50%?
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:05:07
US government will have 0 problem with crypto as long as they start seeing tax revenue from it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:00:24
Seems like for 1.8 mil you would be taking a trip to Bitstamp headquarters not farting aroudn w/ a customer service rep.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:18:42
make no mistake, segwit will not solve the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:35:39
Yes! release your hatred, let it nurture you!
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:56:09
They're going to have a hell of a time proving ownership of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:47:44
I wish this would be stickied
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:41:08
what if we don't want lightening network?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:03:43
I dealt with coinbase for all of about 30 min before i figured out that they severely do not have their shit together.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:49:29
surely nothing to do with the largest crypto exchange scandal involving insidider trading shaking up the noob's confidence
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:27:26
i only have to speak for two people to use we
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:49:32
Sorry if i missed something but.. using an S9 at current bitcoin value and difficulty rate will yield something like 9k in profit annually.  Now of course it will be less because of difficulty increases.
An S9 w/ power supply purchased from Bitmain will cost you around 1600 usd after taxes and shipping.  Supposed you invest 1600 usd in Bitcoin.  Bitcoin would have to increase to 22k in order beat just the investment cost of the S9.  You will of course be mining Bitcoin so as the price of Bitcoin increases so does your profit margin.  To say he will be disappointed seems to me like you are just trying to discourage him.  Again let me know if there is something that I missed.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:35:02
I mean he's entitled to his opinion.  If he doesn't think it will be adopted by the general public then that's for him to say.  You can disagree but this is the thing.  When we are talking about mass public adoption it the technical aspect of it doesn't mean two shits.  If the public doesn't think it will work then they won't use it.  So maybe he is the very type of person who we need to eventual come on board.  When you respond to his opinions the way you did now you are actually the one polarizing the issue.  Do you think with your response you did more to push him off or to bring him on board?
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:59:46
I was told 3 times in the past week it was a pyramid scheme.  My supervisor at work offered to sell me 'steve bucks' which he made up..  nothing will be more satisfying than turning in my resignation and flipping them all the bird on my way out when I no longer need that job.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:35:57
Just because you've seen this graph before don't think that's its happening again for the same reasons or with the same result
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:55:41
I'm new to some of this so still looking at how LN will work,  but uhh what happens when ppl start skipping on their bar tab?
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:38:24
how long do you think it would take until we are at the point of needing 100GB blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:09:45
If anyone wants bitcoin to succeed then they should have enough sense to leave politics out of it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:26:07
for 10k i recommend you visit their headquarters
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:09:33
Don't you think public confidence in crypto due to the insider trading @ coinbase has anything to do with it?
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:51:28
I'm not a big fan of lightening network myself.  Segwit seems to be a stopgap until better things are worked out.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:49:23
Hey I really think he should have been more tactful and the way he phrased it was pretty crude. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:50:42
C'mon this is the internet,  every thing here has a fanboy club.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:26:20
Saying that something doesn't work isn't a polarizing comment.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:03:11
Well that makes sense.  Hopefully that trend continues.  I'm looking to get 8 S9's running on bitcoin in the near future
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:39:11
I like it,  will track and probably be what i use.
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:56:42
Didn't even read it, just straight off to being condescending eh?  First thing I said was I'm continuing to hold.  I'm only leaving this subreddit
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:44:40
That's the problem right there.  I didn't do anything personally.  I've only watched what goes on.  But you ask what I did because you know how the mods are here.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:17:52
you can translate this into 'don't expect to see too much increase in value for the foreseeable future
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:44:30
I get this all the time when I tell my friends at work about crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:38:02
A superiority complex won't get you anywhere.
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:07:53
only in r/bitcoin would this get 192 upvotes
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:34:58
B A select start
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:11:39
I really wasn't worried until you were worried
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:39:49
i don't even get out of bed for less than a 20% increase.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:12:24
Hell no,  everyone should be stoked.  I support bitcoin cash but I don't want to see bitcoin fail.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:02:29
People worrying about whether or not people are worrying worries me.
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:35:53
Are you kidding me? How is that NOT relatable?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:12:49
I won't be looking for a bottom until after the tether scandal plays out.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:48:58
your lack of worrying is worrying
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:11:26
they'll be back when value starts to rise again
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:01:35
I know what your in for too and I hope you have a stash ready to buy this dip.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:39:03
I think you underestimate the greed of man good sir.
