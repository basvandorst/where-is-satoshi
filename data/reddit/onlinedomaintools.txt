This is not news, is it? It seems to be a year old:

What is Bitcoin Bowl?

1)  There is a book icon (the URLis  at the top of the page but it has no title attribute so it is not clear what the action does beforehand. 
2) 
*  - intro.js displays here. 
* Click Previous Problem
* Click Next Problem
* Intro.js displays again. 
-&gt; When I click outside the dialog I still see the overlay.
3) When I click the check mark in the circle a new dialog appears. I understand that the correct thing to do when my submission is wrong is to click "Close" button. I guess it would be nicer to show a close button at the bottom of the dialog because people read from top to bottom so it is natural for them to follow your instructions.
4) I did not wait for the activation email to arrive and tried to change my password right away. I was happy that I could log in without the use of the activation link. Kudos.
I wish you good luck with your project. :)

This is a nice idea. I'm just curious how long (give or take) does it take to transfer money from USA to Philippines through banks?
Merry Christmas :)

We try ChangeTip to see if we can get rid of some ads. Let's hope it will work. :-) I personally don't like ads because I find them too distractive but there are not that many ways for a website to make money on itself. ChangeTip is a new option for monetizing websites creating good content or good services.

That's just outrageous. Spain is probably one of the best countries for producing solar energy..

Well, we test ChangeTip on our site to find out if it would be possible to remove some ads, which would be great for us and our users.
In my opinion, ChangeTip has a great potential. It would be really interesting to add ChangeTip to  :-))
Let's just hope that tipping will spread.

I read that ChangeTip has only 34 thousands signed up users. I thought that the number was much much higher. (Is it a sign of a good marketing strategy? :))

What do you mean?

That looks pretty awesome. To have a solar power source and an electric car is my dream. ;-)

Hi, pricing is briefly described in the [mentioned blog post]( In short, this depends on several factors, mostly on these two:
* type and length of subscription or credit package you buy,
* monitoring period of your monitors.
For example, with Subscription Type A for 12 months, your cost for a single 1 minute monitor will be as low as 0.78 USD per month before 10 % discount for Bitcoin payment, so cca 0.70 USD after a discount. And you will be able to run 17 such monitors with this subscription. And you have more than 60 SMS alerts included, and unlimited number of email alerts. This is just an example of the lowest price you can get with us.
For complete pricing, we have prepared the [Pricing page]( which contains all the information you need to make exact calculations.
Currently, we do not support multiple locations, but this is one of the features we would like to have in the future for sure.
As for alerts - yes, you can set up email alerts, which are free, so you receive an email when the monitored server goes down. You can also set up an SMS alert if you like. It is also possible to have multiple users on one account and set up alerts to be sent to more than just one person.

I don't believe that Flattr will succeed. They would have to persuade a hub (a large website like youtube.com, stackoverflow.com, wordpress.com, etc.) to promote them in some way to achieve mass adoption.
