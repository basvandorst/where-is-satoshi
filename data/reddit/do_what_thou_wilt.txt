LOVE the cross-platform nature of jaxx. The fact I can run it on my mobile, OSX, windows, or Linux devices seals the deal for me. 
Was recently looking at cold storage / hardware wallets. Didn't know you guys were working on one -- very excited to learn about this. "Hurry up and take my bitcoin!"

... but I'm really "jaxxed" for some news about the [Jaxx Ice Cube]( hardware wallet... will there be a pre-order at some point?

[Next halvening in June 2020](
Not long after, the [2020 Olypmics occur in July-Aug]( hosted in Tokyo, Japan - the nation that is leading open adoption of Bitcoin... 
So just a couple of years from now, at least some percentage of the world population either participating or visiting these Olympics, will be faced with the prospect of converting into ¥en and back -- or perhaps into this crazy thing called Bitcoin (that's likely been rather persistent  in the news since 2017 or so...), which is suddenly given an opportunity to prove itself as a true 'international currency'.  Assuming Lightning Network falls into place before then, imo the stage is set for some *MAJOR* adoption opportunity here...

When I was a wee-young-buck,  I was a big fan of this 'new fangled thing called the internet', so when a little company called 'Google' came up for public investment, I mentioned it to my parents, that I'd be interested in throwing some of my $10-month 'allowance' at it, if only I was able to get their help with that.   
They ignored it, as 'just some passing fad' they didn't understand. Nothing came of it. I went back to spending my allowance on comic books. 
Those comics are not worth what the Google IPO would be now. 
Thanks mom!

"oh, you have interest in football" ? (runs out to fully equip kid with $500+ in gear)  
"oh, you have interest in a technology that I don't understand"? (discourages child away)

oh, and *sure* let's let them keep the 'secret' asicboost for themselves, mining at a better efficiency than everyone else. only seems fair.

Called in to confirm/complain. They cite 'regulatory risk'.
Is there any other purchases where the bank steps in with so much 'concern' ?
Remember when they were stepping in to prevent consumers from buying 'beanie babies' and 'pogs' ? 
Yea. me neither. Their industry is scared - rightly so. 
I'll be closing my account and moving my money elsewhere asap.

I find it a rather interesting design choice that the artist went with a 30-year callout to land on the somewhat awkward (artistically speaking) '2018' -- rather than rounding up to the somewhat more generalized 'far-future' date of 2020.

not only is the idea brilliant, but the execution is beautiful. 
hats off, this is awesome.

I want to. 
But it seems all the banks of the nation (canada) have all colluded to interfere in personal financial decisions, and prohibit the purchase of cryptocurrency.

I recently asked a tow-truck driver if he wanted a tip in bitcoin.

No mercy from current administration. 
At this rate, laws will be passed sometime next week to legalize organ harvesting from prisoners, as stand-by replacements for the rich.
