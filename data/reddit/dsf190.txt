Exactly what I was about to note
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:03:26
"Why is the price higher than all other exchanges?  Can't I just buy at BTC-E and sell at Mt.Gox?"

I have 7.4 in Mt.Gox.  We can hope..
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:02:38
I would be willing to if it would work.  I know no one else would be willing to though.  I also knew that this would probably get downvoteted to oblivion so..
@_date: 2014-06-28 01:55:10
I know how you feel, I had 7.4 BTC stolen right out of my hands.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:37:39
Exactly, I don't understand the wiki page.  I read it already which is why I came here to ask but apparently that didn't work.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:50:47
Nope.  Everything is going off of that scribd document and the joint statement.
@_date: 2014-08-22 21:41:42
I agree.  All of the sudden the transaction gained 32 confirmations at once (on blockchain).  Strange!
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:07:38
Yes, this helped me.  Thanks so much!

And if I sign up for the free thing at target, what will this do for me?  How will I know if someone else besides me is using my identity?
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:24:05
I know this will get downvoted like crazy but there is **no** proof that this is valid.  There are no sources, just speculation.
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:35:02
I'm actually having a lot of fun with this game.  I already have a medicinal "herb" farm.
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:10:42
Fair point.  I would have noticed, if I wasn't new to Bitcoin.  I thought that since gox was listed as an exchange site on many sites..blockchain.info, coindesk, preev, etc, that it was a valid company.  It wasn't until I tried withdrawing coins that I found out this issue was going on and I started browsing this subreddit, causing me a lot of panic.

Don't click on this link, whatever you do.  Accounts like this have been posting links usually "freeee" or "i lost xxx bitcoin".  **Don't click on those links**

7.4 BTC
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:01:35
Ah, I see
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:16:22
I hope you are correct.  Thanks for staying positive when all of is saying there is no hope
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:36:18
This.  Thank you for pointing out the obvious.  Obviously a crappy scribd document that is not linked at all to Mt.Gox or anyone that works there can cause enough FUD to cause another price drop.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:21:23
That helped, thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:46:32
Wow, people like you make me remember that there are actually nice people in this world.
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:36:08
At least you didn't lost 4,752BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:01:39
Thanks for this!  I just installed and just like you said, pointed spam site out with a red circle.  Useful!
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:32:56
Where?  I don't see a post anywhere.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:27:52
All I see is Mark sitting back in his chair taking a nice big slurp of dessert-like starbucks coffee and saying "my work here is done".
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:49:25
They were probably saying that he should check the Github to see when the changes would be commited, and he took it as he should use it for support.
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:00:10
Dat search tho
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:07:51
Thanks, this helped me understand Merkle Roots.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:47:34
Just know you aren't the only one, 7.4 lost here.  Which still isn't a lot, someone said they lost around 550.
@_date: 2014-02-18 12:16:58


Why do people always say this?!  It's HASH not Hertz!  Giga HASH!
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:15:10
I want in on this bot
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:55:08
To the moon!
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:16:08
No..my question was "would it work", not "would people want to do it"
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:07:05
Here's my 6.45 BTC that I sent in December.  You can trace their spent outputs if you want.  That would show you where my coins are now.

How do you make charts like this?  Is it a program or do you just screenshot it and overlay the lines?
edit: nvm I see the drawing tools on bitcoinwisdom now
