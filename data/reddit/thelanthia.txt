That would be the most retarded way for them to do it. If it was sanctioned by the manufacturer, the image of the brand would suffer. Also why would they EVER sell it bulk for 300 when they can sell it in throves off of their own website for 800+ / that doesn't make economic sense in any case with such a limited supply good right now.

As a very basic answer (edit: to a very complicated legal issue, and im no lawyer, just an interested private person - so take this take with a take of salt :P ) :
When you buy via a KYCed provider they can have a liens on the outputs which would in a legal case have priority to your title to the outputs. Therefore you would not receive them if you wanted to get them. As far as I understand its more an issue of you letting your coins on the exchange where you bought it. But on the other hand, if you are kyced - they might just come for you at home as well. Therefore the advice is still: try to buy without any kyc attached.
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:07:06
lol good luck enforcing that.
@_date: 2019-07-30 19:19:19

While that is a good philosophical idea, in practice I have become quite good at 'timing' my buys from gut feelings within a prob. 10% margin of error on dips. So I make more Satoshis by stacking them at certain points in time. Also I would highly prefer to just earn Bitcoin but there needs to be quite a bit of friction removed for this to happen without losses ( i.e. bills need to be payable in btc etc etc.) Chapeau to anyone who can pull that off at this time. For myself I am ok with how things work out for now. :)

who the hell wants to use BTC for micropayments at this point? It's not anonymous. Use monero for such things until LN comes around and stop spamming in the meantime. On-Chain transactions will be quite expensive all the time and are dwarfed in comparison to the cost of shipping gold around the world which is the non-digital equivalent.

@_date: 2018-09-01 10:20:17
Definitely not a bug, but radical transparency is an important feature of Bitcoin. Why?
1 - Make sure no one can secretly inflate it.
2 - Hold Governments accountable to their spending when Bitcoin serves as world reserve currency.
3 - If you do it right you will be able to uphold anonymity even if nothing changes from now. Coinjoin, Coinshuffle, Ricochet etc. Most importantly: Buy for cash without KYC.
I agree that fungibility is very important. But we need to get a way to make Bitcoin more fungible that doesn't remove the transparency guarantees of the base layer where we need them.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:35:04
You will need to wait until a miner picks it up unless you are using a wallet that allows RBF or CPFP in which case you could bump up the fee. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:05:02
I think the volatility doesn't need to be put forth as the argument in this case. He invested in an asset that he doesn't understand at all and has no clue how to protect himself from being relieved of said asset. 
 sorry for your loss, but Bitcoin is a personal responsibility asset. So, no, there is no way to get your money back if the tx is done.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:59:18
this is an issue with having super small amounts in wallets. Due to the fees you won't be able to get much for it. To be frank I would just leave it there and wait if there will be a time where the fees get sufficiently small to send it for like 1sat / byte. This may be because we invent new tech that allows for such small fees. For now, I don't think you have a chance to get the transaction mined though, so please be patient. (Also it might never be worth it. We dont know how the fees will be playing out.)

if you need to transact urgently then pay the 25sat/wu? Otherwise let it calm down and use a lower sat amount? How many times does this need to be re-iterated? Were you not around when it was 200+k tx in the mempool in 2017? As long as your tx outcompetes for Blockspace, its not a problem.

The issue with your argument/line of questioning is that you assume that hoarding it is not a useful function to people. In fact wealth preservation is one of the main drivers for sound money (meaning a monetary basis that can't be inflated at will). What hoarding/hodling does is removing supply from the everyday market thus increasing all other things equal the demand. With higher demand come higher prices ie. you need more USD to buy 1 BTC as fewer people want to sell theirs. 
Bitcoin's devisibility into Satoshis seems to give it enough flexibility to sustain enough supply to not 'run out' on the market even though a good portion of users use it as a Store of value. If this will be true in the future is of course like many other aspects pure speculation.
If you have any specific further questions that I missed please let me know :)
@_date: 2018-09-13 19:01:19
really depends on what your pos is and how your money flow works. Could you be a bit more specific what your current payment methods are and how you guys get the money? (direct cash, credit card, in store, online, etc.)

@_date: 2018-09-14 08:17:54
Well in modern society as we know it you will have people that use tech and others build it IMHO. The difference being that theoretically everyone could go out and build their own app if they chose to. That's a very important aspect. Also one thing to consider is that when people find out about how the system works some will likely support the Network by running their own fullnodes or by running full nodes that their relatives connect to. I'm running a full node like that for instance so my not so technically inclined relatives and friends can connect their Android wallets ( yes I actually got them to install and use samourai) to it - they trust me in that regard. There is a big variety of people on this planet after all :)
@_date: 2018-09-14 07:20:08
Of course. That's the plan. The 'normal people' will use lightning based apps (be that lightning wallets or other derived applications) without understanding of the underlying system. They will know that they pay with bitcoin i think, but they won't know or want to know how that works. Some will ofc dive into it and maybe the coming generations will just know intuitively how these networks operate as they grow up with the technology being around them all the time, basically like the current generation (25-35yo) intuitively knows how to use the web and applications on/for it.

the issue you run into using this approach is, that you are already known to be a user. You have to believably convince the government that you lost/got scammed out of/sold immediatly your Coinbase bought Bitcoin.
I'd advice to go cash only non-kyc.
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:27:40
I understand your frustration, happened to many people as well before. Essentially no - your money will not stay stuck in limbo forever. You have a couple of options:
1) The mempool has seen periodic growth lately so there is a very good chance your transaction will get picked up anyways soon-ish.
2) Replace By Fee or CPFP Transaction (which essentially replace your current transaction with a new one with higher fees) - this is limited though on the tx that your Trezor sent and you should be able to check your software if you find an option for that.
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:09:40
Did it occur to you that debasing a currency might reduce it's value compared to Bitcoin thus skyrocketing the number of units of said currency to aquire an equal amount of Bitcoin, or do you just lack any integrity/research prowess/economical understanding?

Before Lightning with sensible people, YES absolutely. That's why almost no physical merchants accept it yet. Nobody wants to pay with it where he can't wait a 10-20 minutes at least. (Private car purchase or similar is not an issue in this regard, coffee is). That's why lightning is important and is being built.
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:21:14
why would you sell your bitcoins. Maybe the shitcoiners care?
@_date: 2018-08-01 09:44:40
As they were for Bitcoin all the time, esp. in the early days. We as a community should focus on solutions to the concerns and there are many talented people working on that imo. To pretend that LN is only great and there are no tradeoffs is intellectually dishonest anyways. None of the people ( et al.) that are actually working on that stuff DO THAT or HAVE DONE THAT. They are very aware of potential risks and taken tradeoffs. 
What we also have to do though is to highlight good and valid criticism in the light of the spew of misinformation that shitcoiners tend to regurgitate.
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:15:23
Hey, the issue is that there are more transactions in the mempool and the fee you paid might not be enough to persuade miners to include you into the block they are building. Look at this website and you will see how it looks currently.  (Especially the MEMPOOLSIZE in MB Chart is interesting). Seems that the fee-prediction in your trezor didn't get it right).
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:20:44
It's not enough, because other people decided that their Transaction are worth paying higher fees. 
Your trezor is estimating how much you should pay according to statistics of a certain amount of blocks in the past. They can't predict the future though. So in essence you either should start setting your own fees or be comfortable that there is no guarantee that your transaction gets taken in by a miner in the next block.
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:40:03
While I understand your frustration I have to point out again that the fee selection algos are not on point. If you really need to have a transaction picked up:
1 - use RBF transactions
2 - use a higher than necessary fee (overpaying a little wont kill you if the transaction is really important)
These things go along with possibly changing your wallet of choice for high-prio tx. 
All the best, 
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:35:12

I don't think it is feasable for small non-tech mom&amp;pops yet. It will get easier over time though. As for now, if you want to accept LN - you better be technically versatile and have some BTC already. In that case just follow one of the very good Tutorials for LN Nodes and thats it.
If you get small shops to accept on-chain first, you are already doing a good job for the ecosystem.

See the issue is, as I explained earlier - it's simply not easy to do right now (in a way you can trust the setup)
This gist may help and provide 'easy to follow' instructions ( 
BUT: for non-tech savvy people it is still quite hard. Especially if you run into issues. That's why I would personally advice against setting up such a system except: 
- you are a sysadmin-level and linux experienced IT person / Developer
- your company employs such a person/team (which would be very rare if you are a mom&amp;pop)
Wait a year or 2 and let them use on-chain until then. There is no hurry now. They will be in the first 1% of accepting businesses anyways. Explain to them how Bitcoin is secured, how transactions work, how they need to keep their own private keys safe. That will serve so much more for this nascent ecosystem than you might imagine. We are in the infancy stage still. Lots of people seem to believe we are ways along. But we aren't. The goal is global reserve currency (network effect 7).

\- a computing device capable to run the client of choice (like Bitcoin Core or knots or whatever)
  1 - raspberry pi 3 or similar or old pc
  2 - 1tb Hard drive to have some spare drive space
\- Electricity used by the device of choice
The benefits are:
\- privacy
  1 - you can check blocks etc without using a public block explorer
  2 - check tx without leaking tx data to other nodes
\- be your own validator
  1 - check if your tx went correctly and people didn't scam you when you sell them stuff
There is no direct monetary profit involved.

You're doing great testing work! Thanks for that. Remember they call it beta for a reason. There's still quite a bit of growing pain to be had. Most important currently for individual node operators is to get their rebalancing right. Takes a lot of effort and manual input.

Just a personal sidenote on the question you are raising: I started to convert all my 'fiat-purchases' into BTC a little while back. Helps to keep perspective like: 
\- Do I want this new phone for just 1000 $ vs.
\- Do I want this new phone? It's .25 BTC WTF hell no.
reg. the question itself my 2 sat: One has to always consider 1 BTC === 1BTC, no matter what. Otherwise they will get parted from their Bitcoin at the worst time. If one considers Bitcoin savings as long-term it is absolutely irrelevant whether it is 1000$ or 100k $ / 1BTC. When mainstream wakes up to this madness of modern monetary theory and negative interest rates, unlimited public debt - they will look for alternatives. And currently I don't see anything coming close to Bitcoin in this race. (sorry goldbugs, it's just not portable enough :( )

Bitcoin is volatile. You can't really send USD 20 exactly. Also your Fee is not designated in Cents but in Satoshis per Weight Unit. Therefore I strongly advice not to use USD as exact measure but Satoshis and check prior to the transaction with the other party how much is owed. Hope this helps :)

Most people don't seem to know that PayPal was actually conceptually a much more disruptive product when they started it. By the time the regulators had done their "job", and because PayPal wasn't decentralized, much of the disruptive force was gone. Therefore I'd argue if PayPal doesn't adapt in the correct way it will be disrupted by lightning applications. But I think they might be ready to pivot in the right direction, who knows.

First of all lets not mix up terms here. Bitcoin per se is not deflationary. It has a fixed money supply. In fact - until 2140 Bitcoin has a small inflation rate of circulating supply.
We are at an early Adoption Stage of Bitcoin. This means that the demand keeps rising while liquidity grows - this leads to huge rallies. Still the overall market is tiny compared to other assets like gold - so news events (and overall market sentiment) have insane impact on the price.
All this is actually quite healthy for Bitcoin at this stage. It needs to shake out the weak hands while maturing. It needs to be attacked from all possible angles so it can immunized before it can join the real clash of currencies.
Bitcoin is programmable money- today we have only scratched the surface of what is possible, yet we are at a 120bln market cap. I foresee that within 10 years everyone and their mother will use Bitcoin one way or the other possibly without even knowing that they use Bitcoin under the hood.

For me still oldie but goldie: Take your Money, split it in 5 pieces, add 1/5th today and every 7th day from now. You will have an average price over the period of five weeks. (called "Dollar-Cost-Averaging")
There is one diversion of the D-C-A that I like:
Keep the last 20% of the previously mentioned amount in Cash on an exchange and set it to a low entry price (previous resistance level approx. or "great even" --&gt; google for these terms) - also keep an eye on the price if there is a big move downwards you can make yourself a little more BTC.
Everything else is pure speculation and can cost you enormous amounts of money.

I think this is a contentious point and we need to be very careful about such generalized statements. IMO  there is and will be major opposition to any increase in Blocksize in part because of the block propagation issues that such a change entails, not to mention that at least currently (until a method of sf can be found) it would be a hard fork that many generally reject except maybe in the case of a major crisis like pow-algo broken etc. 
For me while this as any discussion is a valid one and can be had at any time is not a focus right now. We have some major improvements in the pipeline and LN needs to get A LOT more battletesting and expansion. I hope we'll have a little more time (12+ months to get some done) before the next rally.

old but wise Blizzard philosophy applies: It's done when it's ready. 
LN is very young, immature and needs time to develop. That it takes long should tell you how thorough it is built - one can't even compare development in Bitcoin and on top of it to these centralised scam tokens where devs push out some bs that will break every single day. There are still bugs to be found in BTC and LN but they are quite rare. That is necessary because we are dealing with people's money/livelyhood here.
If you want to see LN grow - read a lot, teach your family friends etc about how Bitcoin and LN work. If you are a dev, start committing some time towards something in the ecosystem for Bitcoin/LN. So much work to be done, so little time in a human life.

While gold has some utility as a metal it's far more treasured because of it's natural scarcity. The stock to flow ratio of gold is unmatched in physical assets. That said, mining can increase the amount of gold being mined if demand were to grow exponentially. Bitcoin on the other hand has mathematically ensured scarcity via its consensus mechanism - this means no matter the increase in demand, the supply and it's distribution is fixed and unchangeable. Therefore one must conclude that Bitcoin is harder money than gold and harder money wins.
What your post in particular is missing and since you asked about it: The base protocol of Bitcoin needs to be the afforementioned hard money. It could be equated to the gold being horted in the central banks and other vaults. But there is more to it - Bitcoin can scale in layers - The layers on top of the base layer will carry over transactional benefits while increasing throughput drastically and so increasing the advantages over gold..
Also: as long as no catastrophic event occurs (pandemia or meteor strike wiping out all human life and all records, EOL of the sun etc) the digital nature of Bitcoin is a big advantage over gold (increased velocity, decreased cost etc etc.).
All that said - be warned, Bitcoin is still new (10y vs \~10^(4+) y in gold) and a catastrophic bug could send all the value down the drain.

Base layer denomination doesn't mean we can't subdivide on l2/l3. If you think about base layer transactions as equivalent to settlement of central banks, then you can imagine how a normal person would never need to touch this layer. They would use a sidechain or higher-level network to facillitate payments etc. without the need of settling on the main chain in most usecases.

As long as you stay fully digital that's great. For Fiat-Onramps not so much. And why would you ever want to exchange for other digital goods? So much opportunity cost to be had. Thus - as long as Bitcoin is not the unit of account and we 'need' fiat - we need to find better exchanges. Bisq is a step in the right direction - but the liquidity needs to grow massively. Go and buy some BTC there.
Regarding localbitcoins - Since they implemented KYC they are not to be trusted either.

@_date: 2018-11-15 09:07:24
the thread has already covered most points to an extent,
\- reg. the 'no one buys the USD to hodl it for years':
That is exactly the issue. The current system encourages spending over holding because governments inflate away your earnings if you don't spend. Therefore a rational investor with no hard money has to find a way to spend the money. This leads to many issues which the Austrian School of economics does a good job of explaining (recommend you read/listen to the mises-institute yt/blogs).
I argue that, if the USD was a sound money (i.e. on the Gold Standard), Bitcoin would be way less valuable today. It wouldn't be worthless as censorship resistance with distributed nature is still an interesting thing, but pretty niche compared to what it is today. THE best sound money currently available.

1 - thanks for the long reply. I see you are very passionate about this and have thought it through thoroughly. I appreciate that because many 'proposals' are just 'hey here's my new great idea' that we have read 10k times before.
2 - I still fail to see the complexity using the term mnemonic seed. it sounds funny - sure. But there is nothing stopping someone (including you and me) from just explaining it as 


I'm definitely not opposed to that and agree with you that people will understand the term 'masterkey' when they hear about it the first time.
3 - I think your notion that average users don't and shouldn't need to care is wrong in the context of money. Average users of money not caring is what lead us to this mess we're in in the first place. Bitcoin is not so forgiving and average users will need to care to some extend to be technically versed and understand the main concepts. It's very easy to see - if they don't care, sooner or later they will get parted from their bitcoin. (i have hope in that area  as children today are already very technically versed - they will be the natural users of Bitcoin in the future - and understand it very naturally).
So my conclusion is: Do the good work and explain it to people in the best terms possible when you meet them, use the explanations in articles, videos etc etc. Discontinuation of used terms is not a priority in my opinion though.
All the best tL

The issue I see is that your terminology is not technically accurate. People can adapt to technically correct terminology but once they start using this wishy-washy bs language (which they are doing all the time regardless // not an attack against your specific terminology), they will not be able to grasp the concepts correctly - this movement is all about financial independence and disintermediation. So people will need to stop whining about small things and get curious about what mnemonic seeds, private keys, public keys and addresses are and how they intertwine. It's not quantum mechanics, so most people can understand it if they try a little.

You should take into consideration what a removal of block size would mean for the whole game theory Bitcoin is built upon. Scarce resource space leads to fees that secure the network against attacks.

- I understand the original reasoning behind it (being a compromise between  and  camps) but how would 2MB blocks help us in the next few months when we don't even use the effective increase segwit gives us in the network?
My current perspective is that every business thats on the s2x list should first enable segwit and migrate their customers to segwit, then check if a hardfork to 2mb is necessary. If it is necessary I'm fine with it. Just don't see it currently.

Your strategy is sound. Timing the market usually won't turn out better. Ofc you can do a little variation: 
Add your amount each week and keep a low open order ( sub 5k right now for instance ) for another part. There are sometimes spikes on exchanges that happen because someone makes big mistakes like selling market for huge amounts.

Let's make this crystal-clear:
If your machine is/was ever connected to the web it will NEVER be as secure as a hardware wallet. You can't even be calling it cold storage at that point. You can use a desktop wallet to use it as cold storage if and only if you know what exactly you are doing - meaning implementing something like glacier-protocol or similar with commodity hardware. 
If you are not 100% certain though you will be better off using smthg like coldcard wallet in 99.99999% of the time. If your hardware wallet never touches the web and you use psbt you essentially get the benefits of real cold storage. (there are ofc attack vectors that have to be thought about)
And let's also be clear that for most people (most likely also for the op) it doesn't make sense to go glacier protocol or similar because of the amount of funds secured doesn't need this amount of effort. Think about who your adversaries will be to assess what you need to do to protect your keys.

`console.log('Testing mnemonic: ',bip39.validateMnemonic(mnemonic))`  
`const seed = bip39.mnemonicToSeed(mnemonic)`  
`const root = bip32.fromSeed(seed)`  
`console.log("Pubkey", root.neutered().toBase58());`  
`const path = "m/44'/0'/0'/0/0"`  
`const child1 = root.derivePath(path)`  
`console.log("adress m/44'/0'/0'/0/0", getAddress(child1))`

Haha, thats not your average american (500$ in savings, huge amounts of Student loans, house leases, consumer credit etc...)
But for arguments sake -&gt; with no further issues on the horizon, if i was in that situation, i'd probably put down 2.5k now in btc, as un-kyced as possible, add 200 for a coldcard and a couple of opendimes, then I'd setup a plan to add \~50/week recurring as un-kyced as possible (small atm buys or similar). 
Then i'd spend another 75 bucks and buy: a programming book, preferably c++, mastering bitcoin or equivalent. If possible, a programming class at a community college or other means of education would also be a wise investment (if no cs skills present). I'd also count cost for a handgun, ammo if none is present though.
So lets round up and say 2500+200+75+1000= 3775 + (programming course cost if necessary)
Rest of the money: keep most of it handy I'd say as we are basically in bubble territory everywhere. Doesn't hurt to have a little bit of gold/silver as well.

what kind of protection do you mean? 
this quote seems to be pointed at gov. protection by use of force. Would be interested to know how you would translate that to Bitcoin.

Your overreaching and unfounded assumptions make your argument too weak to even be discussed in more than a dismissive way. Go back and formulate it better then - maybe - we can talk about it.

the energy consumption of Bitcoin is not wasteful but efficient. We will see a lot of investment into new tech in energy because of bitcoin mining.

You can do chaumian coinjoin today with wasabi. With enough people use it it's pretty cool. I still think you are correct in that protocol level privacy is very important. It's still unclear what the correct way for this is though as there are several trade-offs with all of them. Remember though, when you can find an on-ramp that is not kyc'ed you have pretty good financial privacy even today. They're rare though.

1 - I think it's highly unlikely the list gets changed as the prerequisites for generating it are very specific (no duplicates first 4 chars etc pp)
2 - You can still to make sure copy paste the thing as many times as you wish to as many locations as you wish (like github fork, personal storage server, etc etc. So it's highly unlikely to get wrong. Make sure to also save the encoding/decoding script alongside so you are certain it uses the same algo (0, 1 bound arrays etc.) :)
3 - Very important: Test it and make sure your relatives (or whoever) know how they can restore (if you want them to be eligible when you are not able to retrieve the data.

you don't need to find a wallet. Use the seed (12 - 24 words) and restore it into some credible wallet like Samourai on android. Don't EVER INPUT THE SEED TO ANY WEBSITE!!!!

1 - my feeling is your feeling is wrong (unless you are talking about non-bitcoin/crypto/blockchain people). Bitcoiners as I have tapped into their conversations base their 'normal person' around the homo economicus model imho.
2 - Sorry a little time constraint, please check misir mahmudov's podcast appearance here: [
3 - this is just a symptom of the system we currently have. Why should it loose value over time, this shouldn't be the case, regardless the way it is used (stored, invested or whatever)
4 - ok thx for clarification

I don't think I'm the first pointing this out but once channel factories etc are in Lightning we can just spin out a channel with many others at once reducing the amount of fee payable for a single one to near zero. This should address your main point as people with such low amounts of money ( no offense ) will not be able to use the base layer imho.
 Think of base layer as settling layer that replaces central banking. Would you expect a person in Venezuela right now to settle their balance against the US Fed?

reg 1. -&gt; I'd rather have you read Mises, Hayek et al. :)
reg 3. derives from arguments made in 2. -&gt; tldr: as current money is not strictly limited (can be printed out of thin air and thus devalued) but our time and resources are, ceteris paribus we are worse off under the current regime than under a Bitcoin regime.

1 - Who are these so called advocates that lack understanding? How did you come to the conclusions you make in your post.
2 - The fundamental value that bitcoin provides seems to be financial sovereignty which doesn't necessarily mean that there is no need for banks or there will be no banks. It makes Banks an option. Also it enables everyone who would never be able to get access the current banking system. 'Banks' can be good at certain things, like physically protecting hardware that stores backups of keys, pooling of wealth to make investment decisions easier etc. (this doesn't mean that we need banks in exactly the form we have them today of course). It means that no entity can debase the value one accrues for spending a finite good (his/her time, labour and materials) by converting it to a non-finite good (i.e. Fiat Money)
3 - Your bet makes no sense economically. Also your example of Amazon is weak. Amazon would much rather cut out the third parties if it could to lessen friction and reduce overhead and increase PROFIT. But in the current state of a FIAT world monetary and payment system there are hurdles to do that (regulatory requirements et al come to mind).
4 - Again, who is most of IT? Have you talked to most of IT? Who are you to judge what they understand/don't understand?

There is no such thing as one coin. Read about UTXO's and you should understand how it works.
To answer your question about 10 + 1 - 1 = 10 here directly though **if you don't reuse addresses** it is basically going to be:
At the time you got **11 Bitcoin Balance** in your wallet software
UTXO 1 \[on address1\] = 1trillion sat
UTXO 2 \[on address2\] = 100mio sat
If you don't use coincontrol (choosing your own UTXO to spend) your wallet will decide what to spend. in this case it will probably use UTXO1 (because UTXO2 doesn't have funds to pay the mining fee) and generate a Transaction like this:
INPUT &lt;UTXO1&gt; =&gt; OUTPUT &lt;UTXO3 (100million sat)&gt; + OUTPUT &lt;UTXO4 (change of UTXO1 - \[UTXO3 + Mining Reward\])
So your balance afterwards will be:
UTXO 2 \[on address2\] = 100mio sat
UTXO 4 \[on address3\] = 999,91mio sat
and your wallet will show a balance of approx 9.9991 Bitcoin.

while I am not against evaluating the block size in a non-hardfork context - I don't think this will fly. Block size shouldn't be our no 1 prio for the next decade. let's work on signature aggregation and getting fungibility solutions going.

What are you using to mine it? CPU/GPU mining isn't going to get you anywhere anymore.
I'd advice to just buy Bitcoin whenever you can afford to. That way you'll be able to make more than with a small scale mining operation :)
