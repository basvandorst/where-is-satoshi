He didn't miss out. Anyone who has even a ounce of investment knowledge knows that Buffet lives by simple investing rules. He may not beat the S&amp;P or certain funds/retail investors on some years, but on 10,20,30,40 year averages he beats everyone, because it's easy for any jo shmo to beat a top fund/holding company manager 15-20% of the time. Then when volatility strikes and those high beta plays fall, his don't. The intelligent investor never gets sidetracked by the big names everyone is talking about with huge multiples and using pro-forma tax rules.

Wow what a douche. I don't think anyone smart enough to have an MBA would be dumb enough to speculate in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:15:35
Why do people use the term market cap for something that isn't an issued security? It sends a false message that bitcoin is a stock that can be evaluated on more than chart technicals

8 symptoms of groupthink from The Little Book of Behavioral Investing by James Montier:
1. An illusion of invulnerability: Members ignore danger, take extreme risk and are overly optimistic.
2. Collective rationalization: Members discredit and explain away warning contrary to group thinking.
3. Belief in inherent morality: Members discredit and explain away warning contrary to group thinking.
4. Stereotyped views of out-groups: The group constructs negative stereotypes of rivals outside the group.
5. Direct pressure on dissenters: Members pressure any in the group who expresses arguments against the group’s stereotypes, illusions, or commitments, viewing such opposition as disloyalty.
6. Self-censorship: Members withhold their dissenting views and counter-arguments.
7. Illusion of unanimity: Members perceive falsely that everyone agrees with the group’s decision; silence is seen as consent.
8. “Mind guards” are appointed: Some members appoint themselves to the role of protecting the group from adverse information that might threaten group complacency.

Berkshire is one of the largest shareholders of IBM... 
He may not buy them much, but he will if it actually makes sense and the multiple isn't out of control and he can put a reasonable valuation.

Can you explain said fundamentals? As an investor (not in bitcoin), I'm genuinely curious. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:58:34
Ah, yes. The same argument people made in the Late 70s, and again in the late 90s. 
He's also probably the most down to Earth billionaire investors in the world who barely lives like a millionaire let alone a billionaire. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:13:19
My point is bitcoin is not a security issue. Market caps are used to calculate issues. Price * shares outstanding. Bitcoins aren't shares. You don't own a company and there certainly aren't fundamentals in a security issue sense to analyze them. The only way you could in a security sense is via chart technicals. 
Bitcoin also doesn't operate like currency figures either for reasons I'm
Sure most are aware of on here. BTC needs it's own terminology because using typical investing lingo with it gives many "investors" a false sense in what they are speculating in.

A multiple in investing is the trading price of a stock in relation to another statistic such as earnings, book value, sales, etc. so for an easy example, let's say that stock X has an earnings per share of $1 and the stock trades currently at $12. It's price/earnings multiple (one of the most common) would be 12/1=12. In investor terms, generally stocks of mature companies trade at a P/E multiple that is generally 10-15. Growth stocks (large scale earnings/revenue growth year over year) particularly tech, biotech, etc, usually trade at multiples higher than 20. Twitter and Facebook and 3D printing stocks are good examples today. They can trade to an almost infinite level, such as Amazon that trades at a PE of nearly 100. It gets even harder to place an earnings multiple on stocks that aren't even profitable on the bottom line. 
That's where people like Buffet hit the brakes. There's too much uncertainty for people like him. When stocks trade at such high multiples, there's lots of pressure on the company to continue massive growth. If any number of negative external factors happen, including irrational exuberance, growth stocks can come tumbling down. 1999 tech bubble is an excellent example. People like Buffet look for opportunities in proven companies that may be trading at a lower multiple than they should, for any number of reasons. These stocks typically would be trading at a P/E under 10.
That's a very simplistic answer and it can get far more detailed but hopefully that helps.

That's nice. I'll keep investing in actual things I can quantify and do analysis on. Keep on speculating..... 
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:40:33
You make some good points. The thing is I don't think ANYONE knows what will happen outside of the next 3-5 years in terms of technology disruption and the next big thing. It's nearly impossible to predict because so many possible external factors/disruptions can come into play. 
The idea of bitcoin has a lot of potential for disruption. How it gets there, if it stays in the same incarnation, and whether or not a new digital currency comes along that somehow is better and more secure is anyone's guess, though. That is at the heart of his point. He only invests in things he know won't lose money. And bitcoins volatility matches any high beta equity or commodity out there. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:18:44
There's no such thing as investing in bitcoin anyway. It's all speculation 
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:29:58
It's not that he specifically steers clear of technology. He sticks to buying stocks with massive brand appeal, somewhat of a monopoly on the market, stable earnings growth, PEs no larger than 20 but mostly 8-15, trading below NAV, and have stable dividend payments and growth. 
He basically follows the ideas of Benjamin Graham, the most intelligent investor of all time.

I hope OP is right, because the press will have a field day if you all end up raising BTC for the real Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:42:50
Probably because he's factually incorrect. Buffet DOES use email, hell he even has a twitter account. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:51:15
To everyone who says Buffet doesn't understand technology, just stop. He just doesn't invest in technology when he doesn't understand how the MULTIPLE the stock is trading at doesn't justify the financial statements, growth projections, and possible future market entrants.
The guy is one of the largest holders of IBM for christs sake. And he has been for a long, long time. Yeah, IBM isn't at the forefront of everyone's mind when it comes to tech these days, but it's tech none-the-less. 
I suggest many of you read up more on the tech bubble of the late 90s to understand his thought process. I'm sure most of you already know but maybe give yourself a refresher. Lucent technologies comes to mind.

I mean you can disagree with him all you want, but he's practically the godfather of investing and his thesis has been proved correctly over and over again. I suggest picking up the book and reading it and deciding for yourself afterwards.

Who cares where the quote was from? He mentions it in both books but The Intelligent Investor is a MUCH easier book to read if you don't have a finance background AND has much more anecdotal evidence.
If you read either of those books you'd know he does in fact consider real estate and loans to be speculative, as well as many stock purchases. It's about the process that you go through to come to your conclusion. With most "investments," you simply cannot make a credible thorough analysis to the degree he is saying. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:04:09
nearly 100% speculation.

An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.
