Question: let's say I have a computer that's always-on (and not in a low power state) anyway. It's not fitted with a GPU so it would be mining using spare CPU cycles.
Will it get *anything* over the next, say, year? I wouldn't care if it's profitable or not, just if it's a complete waste of time to even install the software.

Multiple wallet files would be cool (correct me if the Bitcoin client already allows this). During normal operation you could have just one wallet file with your spending money and then you could have a second wallet file on a second encrypted device for your savings account, that you only use when moving money to/from savings.
If your wallet is going to get stolen, it would be preferable if you didn't have *all* your money it.

He never said that fiat currency is bad; he said that it's mandated by the government.

Darn :(

My guess (though I didn't downvote you) is because it's not possible.

Not quite. There's a desire to for the government to enforce a standard on *something*, but that's not an indication that that *something* is necessarily inferior. You could argue that the fiat system is bad; you could argue that the government doesn't need to force standardization on one currency. It's a bit of a stretch to say that *any* currency the government chooses to standardize on is necessarily bad, though.
Consider an analogy in the electrical system. The government enforces that the electricity in your house is 120V at a frequency of 60Hz (or whatever it is in your country). You could probably even twist this around to make an argument that the government is *ramming 60Hz down everyone's throat at the point of a gun*. Is that proof that 60Hz is an inferior frequency for alternating current?

Ehh I guess it depends on how far you want to stretch the definition of "key". You could have only parts of the key in RAM at any given time, or you could try to perform some rudimentary encryption every time you had to move to/from registers, but it's not really going to gain you anything. Everything you need to decrypt is going to be in RAM at some point.

1. "After the transaction goes through" is not a black-and-white well-defined term. The most usual method is to wait until it has 6 confirmations, at which point you say it's extremely unlikely that that block chain won't be accepted for all eternity. 6 confirmations will take an hour. Probably better to just email them a link to the download or something when the transaction is sufficiently confirmed. Bitcoin is really really not good for transactions that have to be confirmed very quickly.
1. This would be really cool. My understanding of registering protocols on Firefox is you just need the Bitcoin client to accept a 'bitcoin:1blahblahblah' string as a command-line argument and you're good. I don't know how other browsers deal with it, though.

So you're a politician and you want to do something you believe is right, but you're worried how the media will react. Do you?
1. Put out a press release saying "I'm being totally honest about this. I think this is the right thing to do."
1. Do it anyway but set up an account with a fake name and try to be covert about it so the media won't find out...you know...for at least a couple days, and then when they *do* find out you'll correctly look like a liar and a coward.
I fail to see how  is a laudable course of action here.

Backed by Bitcoin? Who's going to give up money to this and why on Earth would they? :P
Personally I'm of the belief that a lot of people don't need *extra* incentive to karmawhore.

I haven't heard this before. Like just in the lobby of a bank? The bank doesn't care?

As a last resort, there is always [ This is where you find someone with BTC who lives near you and you actually meet and exchange money. It is obviously not the most secure way of doing things.

Bitcoin addresses are in a 160-bit address space, so...1 in 2^160 . Supposing you had a rig set up specifically to try and generate address collisions. Suppose further that this rig can make Bitcoin addresses as quickly as it can make block hashes. If it takes this rig, on average, 1 hour to create a valid block hash, then it would take, on average, over 18 thousand trillion trillion years to find a collision with *any* existing Bitcoin address.
So, that's if you bought clusters of specialized hardware to specifically try and force a collision. If you just left it up to chance, the odds are astronomically infintessimal that two people would get the same Bitcoin address within the next trillion trillion trillion years.
