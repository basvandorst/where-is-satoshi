In the Euro Zone there is no law banning this. "In the euro zone Member states must not encourage the mutilation of Euro notes or coins for artistic purposes, but they are required to tolerate it."
I mean technically merchants could still refuse but so far no one has had any problems.

I got something like this: 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:59:34
I found this on Wikipedia: According to the European Commission's Recommendation dated 22 March 2010,[26] "Member states must not prohibit or punish the complete destruction of small quantities of Euro coins or notes when this happens in private. However they must prohibit the unauthorised destruction of large amounts of Euro coins or notes." Also, "Member states must not encourage the mutilation of Euro notes or coins for artistic purposes, but they are required to tolerate it.
I hope she didn't get sentenced...

This has been suggested before, and I like the idea. I think having it 0.0xxx would be helpful for noobies because it could make them curious and make them start questioning their relationship with money.
Meanwhile introducing new terms like MBtc or Satoshis could be more confusing. In the end everyone can stamp whatever they like :)

Agreed. I know in the Eurozone Member states are "Required to tolerate mutilation of Euro notes or coins for artistic purposes" but it may be different where you are. A quick google search is recommended beforehand.

Only large amounts is a crime. But just individual bills is no problem.

Here's what I found, the way I understand it should be fine.
According to the European Commission's Recommendation dated 22 March 2010,[26] "Member states must not prohibit or punish the complete destruction of small quantities of Euro coins or notes when this happens in private. However they must prohibit the unauthorised destruction of large amounts of Euro coins or notes." Also, "Member states must not encourage the mutilation of Euro notes or coins for artistic purposes, but they are required to tolerate it. Mutilated coins or notes should be considered unfit for circulation."

It's actually not Illegal everywhere and it could work. 
 The Hashtag on the Bill gives curious people a place to go look for more information, or to post their own opinion on why they think Bitcoin is stupid. It may not work but it'll start some debate.
Plus there's so many passionate people here, I think it really could work. But Ultimatly it depends on the community, I just thought this could be cool.

In euope it's legal. Everywhere else it can be illegal, doing a quick google search is recommended. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:21:35
It's inspired by the top comment on this thread:  
I just thought it's a cool idea. Yeah it might take a while to understand but I don't think it's THAT complicated.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:10:47
Great Idea, didn't think of that. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:56:36
Any customizable stamp works. I got one like this 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:58:45
They have customizable stamps like this on amazon for about 10 bucks 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:46:01
I've seen posts like this one from time to time. I always thought it was cool, but there was never anything coordinated. So I threw together a subreddit over at and an easy to replicate style guide.  I've made some basic content but in the end it's up to the community to get this thing going. 
Let me know what you think of the idea! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:14:06
Might be confusing between the US and Europe. You're free to do it however you like tho :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:03:12
Good idea! I was just worried it'd be too long. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:39:45
Slovakia is in the Euro Zone, right? It's not a crime then unless it's huge quantities being completly destoryed
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:59:15
Feel free to take this picture and post it where ever you like.
I also threw together a subreddit over at a campaign that's supposed to bring all the crypto subreddits together to see if we can boost adoption.
Stamps like the one used are available on amazon for like 10 bucks.
