Something will happen: as you said, I am not sure exactly what, but something big will. Just one example: the majority of machines mining bitcoin today are S9s, which are old machines. If the price of bitcoin doesn't change, the halving will make these machines unprofitable... and if all/most of them are switched off, the difficulty will decrease by a lot. This will increase the reward for remaining miners, which will make them a lot more profitable - where there is profit, there is demand... and so it goes.  
I know this is only one scenario, but precisely because there are so many, I believe the price will change (and considering previous patterns, I think the price will go up).

Sleep, mine, repeat all the way back to 2019

Maybe start slowly, and continue as you feel more comfortable with it and as you acquire more knowledge. Like the others said, invest what you can afford to lose. Dollar cost avaraging is a great idea.
Another idea for the future would be mining the bitcoin also.

I was reading a different article about this subject this morning. Despite how recent the info is, still interesting to see this 1,500,000 figure broken down to "zombie coins", bogus addresses, unclaimed rewards, bugs, theft and etc...

BTC price dropping... great moment to invest in mining machines with lower hardware prices also... I think/hope that the halving next year will help with the ROI

I believe that what you can earn with daily trading is not worth the risk and/or exposure you got... especially if you can't be tuned in all the time (because of work, family or else). Consistently buying and holding for the long term is safer... and even though you might "lose" some peaks, historically the investments' returns are great.

Here's also a good place within the community to learn a bit more: r/BitcoinBeginners.

That is great news. A consequence, I'd say, of Bitcoin spreading out and being accepted/understood for more people!

If Bitcoin becomes such a badass as mature Yoda is though... wouldn't mind! haha

Great question! 
Trying to be very straightforward, within my knowledge of the system: approximately every 10 minutes, a record of every transaction made in the network is put into a "block of transactions". The system then generates a random number to this block, and with this number, you can have access to the encrypted information within the block. This solution, however, is random and you have to guess it. Bitcoin mining consists of specific hardware generating trillions of solutions per second, until the find the right key, or nonce. The miner who finds this solution is rewarded with (today) 12,5 bitcoins. As there are too many people mining, however, people usually join mining pools and share the earnings of each block.
Hope it helps :)

Nothing against DCA and then making some extra fiat... but HODLing till Bitcoin is the new reserve currency!!

Even when we talk about change, what comes next is also unpredictable. "Revolution" can come in different ways: the dollar doesn't have to fail. Maybe not everything has to break so one triumphs, but we can adapt to new ideas and initiatives that make the system fairer.

The more adoption, the better. Wouldn't you say?

Imagine if you hodl and BTC reaches 100k. That's a great deal for you.

Would love to see that in Berlin also

I have heard so many predictions on Bitcoin price for next year... and I get it... predicting halving prices is exciting, but we should be cautious not to allow our expectations to lead to impulsive investment decisions. Gaps between predictions of $20,000 up to $100,000 just show how unpredictable this is.
And especially for those who believe Bitcoin is more than a way of getting rich, establishing a solid position on BTC over time is the way to go. It's not about next year's price, but about how Bitcoin can change our financial system.
