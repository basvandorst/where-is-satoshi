My understanding is, just like with Bcash, if you are unhappy with the update, you can start your own chain or own coin entirely. I don't think it is fair to call it centralized just because the community is currently so small that it is easy to get a unanimous agreement  on where to take Monero next.

Find a Bitcoin ATM. Most have a daily limit of $2980. Fees are high af
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:17:37
If you have an ID of some kind (Diver License, Learners Permit, State License) you can go to a regular ATM that allows credit card withdraws (Look for ones without added fees) get cash out, and find a Bitcoin ATM near you using CoinATMRadar or something like that.    
--    
Some ATMs only need a phone number verification, although those are few and far between. Even those that say they do not need an ID will still ask for your ID.    
--    
If you don't have an ID try asking a parent or friend that wouldn't mind buying it for you.    
If all else fails, I guess you could use local bitcoins or buy a gift card and sell it for Bitcoin although I do not recommend doing this unless you know what you are doing.

In my honest opinion, I wouldn't use a card to buy Bitcoin. Some banks do not like Bitcoin and will Freeze, then delete, your account if they find you trying to get ahold of some. Now, this doesn't alway happen but why take the risk? If lower fees are what you are after than maybe it is worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:22:25
I'm tired of these miners playing games. I feel like I'm wasting my money. Bitcoin isn't easy to get. I don't send it around often, but when I do I need it to work fast. I don't mind high fees, but with 500 sat/byte I would expect to get into the next block without problem.

Bitcoin price post is like the gateway drug. Every time they go viral and show up in r/all or popular, more people find out about Bitcoin. People on the outside don't care about the impending collapse of fiat. People want GAINZ. Everyone who joined Bitcoin post-2011 joined because they heard someone else talking/writing about how much money you can make. People enter to make money, and stay because of fundamentals.

At least you had the option to hold 6 bitcoin at one point in your life.
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:39:34
Miners have the option to mine empty blocks. You can mine a block just a little bit faster if you don't take the time to verify all of the transactions in the block.
The first miner to mine the block and broadcast the block has been mined to the rest of the network, gets the bitcoin prize.
So when the price of Bitcoin is high, there is a lot of competition to mine blocks, and the total amount of money from fees aren't very high, many miners will opt to just mine the block without any transactions to give themselves the highest chance of mining the block, rather than taking on the risk of losing the block to another miner by trying to collect the fees the block can come with.
Of course, the more and more you do this, the more transactions get put on the waiting list. Some pools have bots that will wait until a certain fee threshold is reached, and then attempt to mine the entire block, while others just always mine full blocks.

You'll have to ask someone else if skipping blocks are possible. To my knowledge your PC will have to download and/or verify every block to check which have relevant data to you in them. You can specify a block height so you only check blocks made after you bought the coins.

[About a week ago I made this post]( exclaiming my idea for the Bitcoin Ad Fund.  
With all the recent controversy about advertisers pulling out of YouTube, I thought it would be a great idea to run some Bitcoin AdVideo campaigns to show YouTubers we have their backs and promote bitcoin in the process.  
(Also it's worth mentioning the amount of impressions you can get on your ad per dollar has increased since there is less competition from other big companies, makes it a great time to start running some ads on YouTube).  
So the post that I made got a few upvotes. I asked for criticism, yet none was given. So, I just winged it and this is what I came up with. Let me know what you guys think. I'm open to changing it. In fact, I much rather get the Ad peer-reviewed here first before sending off to the mods for approval.
@_date: 2019-04-16 22:28:19

@_date: 2017-04-09 15:28:57
There is fan funding, but the amount of people that will donate will never equal the amount you make from ads are unless you have tons of loyal subscribers. Most YouTubers can't live off donations alone. It's just easier for most people to watch a few ads than to shell out a couple bucks for each YouTuber they watch, or pay $10 a month for YT Red. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:51:01
I understand where you are coming from and agree. An ad explaining Bitcoin's decentralized nature would be a better selling point. An ad like such might take up more than 30 seconds. Which there is nothing wrong with that; although, I was initially aiming for a short, snappy, precise, to the point ad.  
I believe the ROI would be worth it in the long run. Within YouTube's AdVideo platform we can target for any demographic, and geographic we wanted. Having this ad bring some awareness into this subreddit will help convert more people into Bitcoin users which are a benefit to everyone who already owns bitcoin. Which is why I was at first going for the "strength in numbers" slogan.

Whether or not 1 pc is mining blocks or the entire world is mining blocks, there will still be a block every 10 minutes. The difficult adjust so that is the case. It isn't instant of course, so if a majority of miners stopped all at once, blocks would be slow for a while.

this is trending, how?
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:12:10
Well I could be wrong. The longer you wait the bigger chance you could miss it. You only have like an hour to buy the 'true' dip.

It's not too late. Trust me bitcoin will ride this roller coaster all the way up into August.

Don't imagine it like a phyical place or website. It's just a program that tells your gpu to solve math problems given to it. If it can solve them you get like 4btc or something

It,s not a fork. It's another altcoin like litecoin, but worst taking the bitcoin name to make some cash for some miners/bad actors.
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:03:02
Here is why a fork is a bad idea.  
1. Bad actors want to control Bitcoin.  
2. Users don't want it.  
3. Fork occurs.  
4. Bad actors leave to the new altcoin.  
5. The altcoin chain dies off.  
6. Bad actors lose some money. Come back to Bitcoin more pissed than ever.  
7. Repeat step 1.  
A hard fork will not solve anything.

Someone should try it them. I'm surprised no one has yet. Or if they have, it wasn't successful. Think of all those ICOs that raised millions of dollars claiming to be the better bitcoin. If they wanted Bitcoin out of the picture, a 51% attack would have done it. Yet, nothing.

It doesn't send Bitcoin to other cash users. You can only buy from Square, and withdrawal to a wallet you own the keys to or exchange. Way quicker then using an ATM.

Rule 2: NEVER FORGET RULE 1
@_date: 2017-06-24 21:43:38
It's not that easy buying Bitcoin when you don't want to use coinbase or some shady website you've never heard about is it?  
I know I will get downvotes for saying this but stay away from most websites you get reccomended.  
A lot of people look for post like this only looking to make money off you from affiate link or just because they own the website.  
Plus buying bitcoin with a card is never a good idea. Some banks refuse to do bussiness with anyone who tries to buy bitcoin and will close your account if you do. I haven't had it happen to me but I haven't tried. I have heard many many horror stories though.  
The best way I suggest you buy Bitcoin is go to your local ATM, pull out some cash and then google Bitcoin ATMs in your area.  
I much rather suggest getting Bitcoins from other people more than a company but at least this the ATM will only keep your infomation locally aligned with your local state laws unlike coinbase which gives all your infomation to the national govement because of Federal laws.  
Then again that shouldn't matter as long as you aren't doing anything illegal with your coins, right? ;)
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:17:32
Very true, but not ideal for the stragglers.
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:12:18
