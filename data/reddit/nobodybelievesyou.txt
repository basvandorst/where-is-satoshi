It apparently didn't get compromised, so I guess good enough. It is sounding like someone got the other key and found a way to get bitgo to sign off on the transactions.

People who have a lot of bitcoins don't like the thought that what they view as their prescient early adoption of bitcoin and the guaranteed riches that await them upon mass adoption may be rendered moot due to the fact that anybody can make altcoins.

Someone in the markets subreddit asked a question, so in the off chance he checks here instead, here were my questions. 
When will you release the calculations behind the haircut amount including how many of bitfinex funds were contributed to reduce the haircut?
Also when will you tell us how you know your new setup is secure if you don't know how your old system was compromised. 
Also when will you release the details on the bfx tokens including how many exist. 
Also when will you release some proof that you can meet existing liabilities with your current assets?
Are you currently collecting bfx tokens as fees for people trading bfx tokens, and if so, how does this square with your insistence that you won't be acquiring tokens via the market?

The tip processing code is clearly a giant broken regex, as evidenced by the former CEO of the company accidentally sending a $100 tip while trying to demonstrate how it wouldn't choose the largest amount in your comment. 
If they hadn't been so cheerfully dishonest in basically every aspect of their operations, from endless sockpuppetry, to their initial and quickly backpedaled TOS, to trying to fly under the radar of API limits by spawning an army of bot accounts on reddit, twitter, and soundcloud, to their casual insistence that their months long YouTube outage was due to Google API changes, to their paid tippers, to their team wide multiple shadowbans...they might have actually gained traction somewhere.

I think most of the issues with bitcoin and the crypto industry in general that I’ve pointed out over the years still exist. The price was wildly unhinged from any fundamental at $100 and it’s only become more detached since then, and the manipulation of the market has reached ludicrous levels. 
The risk reward isn’t there for me, but if people with a lower risk threshold are making money, congrats.

I mean, they have caught up with bitcoin, which is why Coinbase abides by KYC/AML requirements.

Someone with a load of funds has been goofing around with the book the last day or so. There were like 10k btc worth of bids yanked and 10k btc in asks added in a matter of seconds (and the other way). The bid/ask sum ratio bounced down to ~$123/btc and then rapidly flipped back up to ~$700/btc. It normally hovers fairly closely to the current price. Stamp seems to be sitting where it normally does, so this is just a finex thing.
The last time something this dramatic happened to the bid/ask ratio on finex it was when stamp went offline because they apparently were still using stamp's books for extra liquidity. I'm sort of wondering if this was caused by something similar.

A lot of these places started accepting bitcoin because a year ago it meant you'd probably get a blurb on the local news and some free advertising, and then realized that bitcoin enthusiasts by and large don't spend bitcoins unless there is a chance it will make the price go up, as Overstock found out as their bitcoin sales rapidly dwindled to nothing as it stopped getting press coverage.

No, that is pretty much it. It is also one of the reasons that ripple gets so much shit here. If the financial industry decides to hop aboard the blocktrain and adopts a solution that doesn't involve needing to buy bitcoins, bitcoin will forever be stranded with the same small pool of ancaps, libertarians, get rich quick dreamers, and casino market gamblers and will lack the endless mountains of new money required for a successful moon launch.

This is not really true, in any way. The expansion of mining infrastructure is related to the difficulty increases which is related to the expansion of mining infrastructure. None of this has anything to do with transaction volume.

Does the tip feed report collections? I only looked at it for a minute but it seems like it was just the notices about sending and expiring soon. I guess you could run it with a backlog of the expiration timeframe and mark anything that didn't get the warning by the end of the expiration period as collected. 
Will have to look at in more detail after I finish the reporting for the reddit one. My only Twitter bot experience is just hacking in tweet retrieval and and searching for a crappy irc bot and making dumb Markov chains out of Bitcoin guru tweets.

Yes, it is. I'm not sure where the confusion is, because you basically summed it up. When credit cards came out, there they were solving a problem that made the effort worthwhile. 
Bitcoins are still struggling to find a problem to solve that isn't related to how many bitcoins the person insisting merchants should accept bitcoins already owns.

Reddit is a terrible discussion platform for ongoing discussions. Stuff drops off the front page and nobody looks at it again, stuff doesn't make it to the front page and nobody looks at it at all, unpopular comments get buried, people make one comment and then only reply from their inbox and ignore the rest of the discussion, etc etc etc.
It is a link aggregator that has been badly repurposed as a discussion forum, and it is really terrible at it.

That's a terrible example because the duct tape solution was host headers and making acquiring large IP blocks more difficult, and the actual solution was IPv6, which has faced ridiculous hurdles in adoption even in the face of running out of IPv4 addresses.

The distribution wasn't really "agreed on by the community."
It was agreed on by Satoshi even while members of the community pointed out that it wasn't a great idea way back in 2008.
Then Satoshi fired up his computers and mined 1/20 of all the bitcoins that will ever exist before vanishing into the night.
Edit: reading the early mailing lists is fairly interesting. It is a guy trying to convince other guys that a lot of odd decisions are "actually a good thing!" From mining energy waste to bot nets and inflation and coin distribution. Apparently it worked.

I think using Mt Gox or other bitcoin websites that have been hacked or vanished is the main reason if you go by number of coins stolen. Or investing in any sort of bitcoin investment scheme. Or sending coins to websites that sell drugs.

I haven't done anything against the rules, my posts get upvoted way more than they get downvoted in every bitcoin subreddit I have posted in, and, here's the key, I don't constantly spam my website.
@_date: 2014-01-20 01:33:55


lol, no.


I don't care about you downvoting me, but way to ignore the reason we're even having this dumb conversation, as well as ignoring my actual question.


Really? How strange. Where do you get "quite a few" from? What a weird statement.
I guess it is safe at this point to assume you won't actually answer my question. I'm totally shocked. Completely and utterly shocked.
@_date: 2014-08-10 08:54:05
Congrats on downvoting everyone who warned you about this outcome. We did it reddit!
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:59:12
I've had several interesting conversations here. I think you are missing the fact that your statement applies both ways. 
Reddit is set up to punish people debating an unpopular opinion and encourage drive by posting. The number of times I've tried to have a discussion with someone who downvotes, then replies is just aggravating. If you have a fairly new account and get downvotes to oblivion, congrats, now you are rate limited and can't even defend your opinion against the horde of idiots. 
I've been fairly lucky in maintaining positive karma here, but when your posts are immediately buried, and the person you are talking to just wants to elicit more responses they can downvote, fuck it. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 23:16:49
That's a completely fair question. I've seen it posted in more than one place, and I've been looking off and on since I posted that for where exactly it was.
Will get back to you if/when I can dig it up. I've unfortunately cleared my browser history several times from then, and it is real pain sorting through google.
I've already paid the price in downvotes, but I'm not just talking shit here.
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:43:25
It is hilarious that you say this as if centralized payment processors who let merchants avoid having to soil themselves with bitcoin are somehow a great thing for bitcoin. It just makes it more pointless and irrelevant than it already is.

If you're willing to embrace the theory that the guy didn't understand a conversation, that was confirmed by the police, then I don't think that imagining that he changed his story after being mobbed by reporters and going on a car chase is really that far fetched.

Satoshi said a lot of weird shit. It is basically impossible to tell what he was really after with all this, especially since he randomly bailed and has never touched his coins.
Based on his early posts and abrupt exit, I have trouble believing that the bitcoin community as it exists today is something he would be okay with.

don't worry, one of the worst investors on this subreddit just posted a great rant about dodging taxes!
you have, however, hit upon one of the reasons bitcoin is a failure as a currency.
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:49:59
But in terms of bitcoin, its useful properties are generally less useful to the general public than available alternatives, other than as a speculative investment for risk adventurers or illicit/embarrassing Internet transactions.
I don't really see that changing any time soon, which is around where our differences become irreconcilable. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 06:42:30
If Satoshi said a lot of the things he said a few years ago now, he would probably be called a troll.

No, actual cargo cults are really the only comparison that fits. Even the bubble watch chart guy admitted that much of the reason he does it is in hopes of spurring the next one. 
The abrupt shift in narrative from bubble deniers angrily reporting people who posted the bubble chart to weird numerologists desperately overlaying bubble charts to summon the next bubble is, as previously mentioned, weird as hell.

Your example is terrible in so many ways. I don't give a fuck if a cashier is mean to me, and I don't give a fuck if you are mean to me.
If the cashier tried to secretly overcharge me, and then made a big scene when I noticed about how he doesn't care if I like him and this is his store and he'll be the bad guy if he wants, yes, I would complain to the manager...and here's the important part...about that specific employee.
This isn't a witchhunt, and you had a thread on the frontpage calling for your removal because you were doing a bad job and acting smug about it because you thought theymos was going to back you up.
Why would anybody that isn't a mod think this is a good idea?

Well, that's the thing. Some of their numbers are impossible to make add up.
For instance, as a logic puzzle, try to calculate a December transaction number that fits all of their published numbers and press statements. 
Even the guy I was arguing with was unable to make sense of it. Was one of the better discussions I've had here.
I'm hoping they will publish their December numbers soon. I'm guessing the fact that they haven't after all the crowing they did over the rest of the year means something, but god knows what at this point.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:01:20

The fact that some form of this reply is attached to every post where someone loses money should be some sort of a sign. "Everybody knew Gox was a scam!" "Everybody knows btc-e is a scam!" "Only an idiot would leave money on coinbase!" etc etc etc
Instead, the only sign the bitcoin community sees is a sign that it is time to feel smarter than everyone else and rub salt in the wounds of people who have lost money. Until it happens to them, of course. Then it is "HOW CAN WE ARREST MT. GOX??????"
Rotten from the top down.

Just for comparison, last year had $500m transferred on a single day. This is actually a gigantic drop off.

Looking back to old posts in this subreddit, there were loads of people insisting it wasn't a bubble. In true bitcoin fashion, history was rewritten and now of course everyone knew it was a bubble, and now we just have to wait for the next bubble, which is both guaranteed to happen and also now "actually a good thing" for whatever delusional reason.

lol, I like how you suddenly forgot the second part of that, "when the media isn't watching," despite that being the entire content of your previous comment. 
They had a number of bitcoin sales when it was news, which rapidly dried up to a trickle as soon as it wasn't news. I know this because I was the only one here actually parsing their numbers, getting downvoted like crazy because of it, and recently completely validated to the exact percentage of the drop off by Patrick Byrne in his goofy AMA. 
Perhaps try harder next time.

honestly, this post would be pretty chill, and i would agree with it, if other mods here weren't actively posting in obvious spam threads, allowing the entire front page to be filled with dupe content, and then deleting posts that disparaged bitcoins because they were "spam."
it should be an "oh god" moment, when you realize that someone who thinks your community is fucked up and broken is the one submitting ftc reports for the fucking massive number of illegal scams that none of the mods feel compelled to deal with while they waste their time deleting darkwings posts.
but fuck it, right? it isn't like you're a moderator or whatever. free speech! except when it is awkward, or weird.

If I know something is a scam, and I see people getting scammed, yes. What kind of question is that? I've reported loads of ridiculous schemes that get posted here to the FTC.
The worst part is, that isn't even what your original statement was. It wasn't a question of "do you go out of your way to warn people of scams." It was "don't warn people of scams because it might hurt my investment."
That's pretty fucked up, honestly.

With bitcoin you are paying exchange fees or seller markup, eating the exchange spread, paying the built in credit fees, the miner fees, dealing with the volatility, and subsidizing the miner rewards with continued inflation.

I really only report dupes, but it is probably worth mentioning that if you are reporting one of the hype type non-bitcoin posts like mentioned, that are likely to draw comments and/or votes despite not being bitcoin related, it probably isn't worth reporting after it has dropped off of the top of the first page of /new because it seems to be the policy here not to delete posts that have already attracted a good number of comments or votes.

I'm not sure that is true considering their share of the network compare to how many people have been begging miners to use it. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 20:53:50
I think it will be interesting to watch play out. I just think pretending that bitcoin is a low cost system is ignoring a lot of reality in favor of dishonest marketing. I don't think it is usually intentional, but disguising a thing doesn't help anyone make a better decision, whatever that may be.
I also think that off-chain bitcoin transactions make bitcoin sort of pointless.
edit: It is also important to note that off-chain bitcoin transactions are only serving to force miners to rely even more heavily on the block subsidies. If all the transaction growth is not going through the bitcoin system, the argument that they are going to rely on fee increases because of transaction growth crumbles even more.
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:27:14
Yes, I went to your website after you posted that hilariously failed thread as Arabiansands or whatever where you got owned by nerds from the Internet until you finally had to reveal yourself, hoping that an appeal to your own authority would work. 
It didn't work then, and it still doesn't really work. If you're going to post unsupported claims, and then provide a source that contradicts you after you get called on it, then say that I should believe you because you were on TV, then finally end with "just ask anyone!" then I'm going to assume you're either full of shit or just really bad at the Internet.

My basic hypothesis supported by all available numbers is that bitcoin enthusiasts don't spend bitcoins unless there is media attention that may bring in new money and increase the price of bitcoins.  
This is just another data point since the media isn't reporting on porno sites, in general.  
@_date: 2014-01-18 07:27:57


Well, being that I am not a fortune teller, this is the logical thing to do.


See above. 


Is that a growth of bitcoin business, or a growth of bitcoin businesses posting on coinmap? Regardless, if you look at the numbers I posted, you'll see that the number of BitPay merchants did not result in a higher transaction ratio, excluding the holiday push, because people don't really spend bitcoins.


It is also what made usenet, MySpace, AOL, and countless other now faded enterprises what they were. It also seems to be a catchphrase that people have latched onto, much in the same vein as "bitcoin is like tcp/ip!" or "email was hard to use!"
There is no way of predicting the future, so all we are left with is the present, at which time hardly anybody spends bitcoins.

So basically they have followed the Overstock numbers.
$250k day one.
$250k over the next ten days = $25k/day avg, or a 90% drop after day one, proving once again, that people only spend bitcoins in any numbers when the media is watching and it might drive up the price of their coins. What a shock!

Counting online bitcoin wallets is useless for determining interest in bitcoins without some other statistic(s) to go with it. Like how many coins are in it, date of last transaction, number of transactions, etc. 
Otherwise it is like counting MySpace, or yahoo mail, or AIM accounts. People create them, or loads of them. Very few people ever delete them.

First of all, that is dumb as hell. Someone saying negative things about something isn't even close to trolling. 
Secondly, I've made many posts pointing out situations where Bitcoin makes sense. It isn't my fault that the community of conmen has been basically encouraged and nurtured by many of the people who are Bitcoin heroes.

This is a commonly parroted idea, but all this does for the consumer is enable them to flush even more money down the toilet due to having to eat the exchange spread on every purchase, plus the exchange fees, plus the credit card fees which are probably already built into the price of what you are buying, plus any capital gains taxes, plus the hassle of dealing with any of this in the first place instead of just buying the thing with your credit card. 
Which is why we have threads like the one earlier where a company stopped taking bitcoins because it wasn't worth the hassle, because despite all the people saying what you just said, hardly anybody spends bitcoins when there isn't some chance of the media noticing and driving the price up.
edit: which is why Overstock's bitcoin sales have plunged over 90% since it stopped being a newsworthy event.
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:12:31
Honestly, it doesn't really matter if it is independent miners mining for large pools, unless they disperse when danger approaches. For a trustless network that is generating "money" to depend on trusting people incentivized by generating "money" to act against their immediate interests...well. If mining hardware investments paid off in years rather than months, maybe it wouldn't be so dire.

So 130k day one. 370k over the next two weeks and 100k over the last week. 
100k/7=14k a day average, or about half of what the post-launch day two week average was, which was already an 80% drop off of day one numbers. 
This is a huge failure and appears to be getting worse.

Wow what great timing. Another weird Bitcoin coincidence. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:07:47
Because bitcoin is actually very bad at high volume microtransactions. Changetip's pending introduction of fees is actually an interesting portend. 
Many of the selling points that are often regurgitated to make bitcoin appear attractive in comparison to existing payment solutions are fairly time limited. The various no fee payment providers are being heavily subsidized by venture capital injections. Blockchain transactions are being subsidized by ever declining mining rewards, which support an overbuilt mining infrastructure based on bubble level bitcoin value that keeps network transaction fees artificially low.
Unfortunately, neither of these things are sustainable, which even the bitcoin devs have admitted. This fact goes a long way toward explaining the aggressive push by VC and bitcoin investors to shoehorn bitcoin into the general public while there is still time, because at some point in the next couple of years, the VCs are going to need a profit, and if adoption doesn't ramp up before the next block halving, the mining industry is going to get weird as hell.
I realize this isn't a popular thing to say, but there is really no way around it.

There was a user who made several alt accounts to come here crying (and on twitter, and on bitcointalk) because he got domain banned by reddit for paying people bitcoin crumbs to post on his subreddit. This seems like a reasonable thing to do to keep reddit from becoming over run with vote gamers and spam.
For some reason, making threads offering to pay people bitcoin crumbs for posting comments using changetip is tolerated.
On twitter, they appear to be creating multiple "minion" accounts for their bot responses to dodge API limits. I'm kind of curious if the willingness to limit bot responses to three per thread here on reddit was for a similar reason.
I'm also kind of curious what their fallback plan is if one of these services actually bans them.

Satoshi suggests using bitcoins to pay famous people to read your stupid emails.
Someone points out that nobody will use bitcoin because it is massively inflationary. Satoshi seems to admit he just picked the constant rate because idfk whatever it seems ok.
What you were looking for, "server farms of specialized hardware."
Satoshi embraces hijacked computers generating bitcoins as actually being a good thing.
John Gilmore looks into a crystal ball and sees how stupidly wasteful mining will become, while also busting out the first "actual money" burn.
Anyway, the entire archive is great to read and full of interesting discussion. Worth checking out even if, like me, your main interest in bitcoins is laughter.

The problem with /new being full of spam, is that posting your spam "once" is encouraged. Are you encouraging deleting duplicate stories if they are popular enough to get to the front page with developed comment threads? You're killing anybody viewing the comments when you do that.
And "off-topic" is in the eye of the beholder.
Your defense to my comment is basically just agreeing with my comment.

There were a lot of early proposals to use it for things exactly like this, but the speculators blew up the price to ridiculous levels and made it impractical.

It is intentionally disingenuous. There was a concerted narrative push that started as soon as Gox suspended withdrawals. It changed when the DDoS started and other exchanges halted withdrawals without any sense of irony or apology. 
Shady as fuck, just like everything else in the bitcoin community.

Has there ever been a response to any of the many requests to provide some sort of transparent accounting of how the funds are being spent, or just more awkward silence
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:23:03
Two points. 
1) I'm collecting data specifically to determine what the reality is with reddit tipping and how many tips are being collected outside Bitcoin threads. A week ago, it was pretty dismal. The numbers are actually improving. I would like to do some further analysis on the accounts involved, but outside of that, my personal opinions don't affect raw data. 
2) private tips only prevent extraneous changetip spam, not harvesting. 
Hope that helps.

It is only getting more expensive if you plan on buying all the hardware to pull it off. As mining continues its descent into centralized cloud mining companies run by anonymous and / or unscrupulous individuals, it becomes much less expensive to temporarily take over large swaths of the network.

This is also a problem here. My comment was very specific. People here cling to cliches and proverbs as if they are unassailable truths, and as if they are actual arguments. That was the context of this conversation.

There is speculation that the reason people are willing to throw 20% down the drain to buy people things on Amazon in exchange for bitcoins is because they are using stolen credit cards.

I don't know. I hate a lot of things about reddit, but it is one of the few places with a decently sized userbase that you can still just post whatever.
My advice would be to just post whatever and not worry too much about what people on the internet (myself included) think, unless it stops being fun or interesting to you.
And when that happens, for sure, fuck off and do something that you do find fun or interesting, because life is too short.

I'm not really sure how much of their charge back problem is from that. There is a lot of fraud in terms of people paying for a membership, vacuuming up all the content, and then reversing payment, as well as people using stolen cards to do the same thing.
But without the ability to do recurring billing, they are leaving a ton of money on the table. It really is a major issue for the basic porn site business model.
For something like cam sites or clip sites, it makes a lot more sense.

@_date: 2014-01-12 22:56:33
Bitcoins are seen as a good thing by bitcoin enthusiasts because people want to get rich without doing any work while feeling like they are smarter than everyone else. 
Bitcoins are seen as a good thing by the few businesses who accept them because there is a chance they will get on TV. 
That's pretty much the extent of it. 
Edit: whoops, forgot one. Bitcoins are seen as a good thing by scammers because bitcoin enthusiasts are some of the most starry eyed gullible people on earth, and transactions are semi-anonymous and impossible to reverse. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 05:21:43
So essentially, if there hadn't been a deception based around the actual number of atomic units at the beginning to rope in the rubes, bitcoin would never have taken off.
I agree with that, and it is hilarious in the context of the angry dogecoin posts here.
@_date: 2014-08-15 23:09:47

If you told me that Marc Andreessen had dumped a bunch of VC splooge money into a bitcoin payment processor that was in reality what is being used for the Braintree payments, who are owned by eBay, a company where Marc is on the board of directors, no, I would not be surprised, because that is actually what is going on here.
edit: extraneous 'is'

Actually it would indicate that the faked transaction volume dropped off earlier in the year and has started going back up, strangely coinciding with all these "ATH transactions."


So an indication that adoption is stagnating is not an indication that adoption is stagnating. Gotcha. Was worried you were going to argue honestly there for a minute.
The problem is that you have failed to provide any evidence that it is actually growing. All you've done is handwave away evidence that it is stagnating.

haha, are you being serious. You deleted a bunch of comments and then bragged about how you were above the law until theymos made you stop because of that horrible thread, then you told us we could post whatever comments we wanted, then instead of deleting comments, people started getting banned, and then you were smug about that, like it was a hilarious technicality. 
This is one of the weirdest comments I've ever replied to here.
Anyway, it is what it is. Using karma as an autobot censor is a really weird choice since downvoted comments are hidden from anybody who hasn't specifically changed their settings to be able to view them, and spammers use new accounts, baked accounts, or like certain people here, just hide the spam in innocuous sounding posts over and over again while getting upvoted because they sound excited about bitcoins.
Oh well.

I have made many posts about the bitcoin community, and especially the early adopters, dooming bitcoin as a viable currency, despite being an innovative technology that will probably eventually find a great use somewhere.
The problem is that it is rotten from the top down. The true believers aren't the problem, it is the people that are depending on them and manipulating them with the most hilariously outdated MLM and cult recruitment rhetoric, and the infrastructure that supports it. I'm sure there is a common denominator somewhere.

You can answer almost any question like this with "because they own bitcoins."
@_date: 2014-01-14 06:24:14
Before I answer that, let's review a few points from the post we're discussing..
Number 2: By not spending the donations on their intended purpose, ~~I'm~~ "we're" rich!
Number 3: Sure, we solicited donations for a purpose, but not EXPLICITLY.
Number 4: pfffft, it isn't even my money! (see number six)
Number 5: I haven't spent it! Obviously, since I was just bragging about how much more it was worth by sitting on it'!
Number 6: I manage all the money, even though I just said I don't manage all the money, but whatever. If you don't like what I've done with all the money you've donated, please, don't donate all the money you've already donated!
7: lol
Let me know if I missed anything, because number 3 should answer your question sufficiently.

People in the bitcoin world are praying for another bubble. A few months ago, talking about bitcoin bubbles would get you yelled at, downvoted, and sometimes banned here.
Now, an entire belief system around "bubble cycles" has popped up, and bubbles are considered a great thing for bitcoin.

Other than generating even more bitcoin related publicity for an unrequested donation drive for someone who very specifically asked via a lawyer to respect his privacy.
The whole donation drive was a pretty fucked up bitcoin advertisement on the back of a guy going through a terrible bitcoin related experience.
The fact that it still hasn't been given to him weeks after it was promised should be an indicator as to what the actual purpose of this was.
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:47:48
No. I think people won't use it because for most every use other than promoting a political agenda, propping up an investment, or edge cases that most consumers don't care about, it is less useful than existing options. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 06:20:49
Because it is interesting and there are interesting and / or funny people to talk to about it. 
The amount of thought you put into my posts is more than the amount of thought I put into them. Relax, fella. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:28:08
it is a bit frustrating, because it isn't just a matter of the topics being recycled. originally they were almost all 0 day accounts. after i noticed that, i started shitting on all the 0 day account posts, and after a lull they started coming from 1 month X day accounts with no other history. it really seems to point to most of them coming from one person with an agenda.
after a certain critical mass of what i refer to as "gee golly!" posts slip through, they enter the echo chamber and begin getting parroted by people who have no idea they are being manipulated.
at that point, bringing it up just results in downvotes, troll accusations, and bitcoinity flipping to mbtc, so mission accomplished whoever the fuck you are.

They made a similar promise in January. 
The reality is that unless another pool becomes more attractive (at which point the problem will just shift to a different entity) people are going to keep going back. 
This is a bitcoin problem. I'm not sure how a system set up to encourage mining conglomerates is supposed to turn out a different way.

I've made a number of posts containing hard data. Guess what? They get voted down more than my antagonistic posts, even when the person I was actually talking with ends up agreeing with me. How weird!
Being negative about bitcoin isn't trolling, btw. I'm not sure how else to put that. There are a lot of very real problems with it, and the community surrounding it. I'm assuming this is actually the main reason from your list that has made you write me off as a troll. 
I'm very upfront about why I post here, and I don't make up facts to antagonize people. Basically I'm not a troll, by any realistic definition of a troll.

That is what their merchant category is. 6051, which the IRS lists as "Non-Fl, Money Orders" (

They have no incentive to do this. People got up in arms about it earlier this year, nobody did anything, and everyone seemed okay with that until a few days ago when they got all up in arms again. The price took a brief dump, then went right back up. 
The markets don't care, the miners who didn't leave them don't care, reddit probably won't care within the month, the developers don't seem to care overly much...
So why should GHash care?

I'm still struggling to find a compelling use case for the average consumer for transactions that are not illicit or embarrassing in nature.
I'm still struggling to find a use case for the B2B or banking industry where there are already legal and trust relationships that do not require the overhead of a decentralized system.
I'm still struggling to see how bitcoin can adapt to actual mass adoption without ending up back to being reliant on third parties.
I'm still struggling to see how the mining centralization problem is going to be worked out, or how this is not a lot larger discussion outside of the minor panics when a pool gets to 47%.
I'm still struggling to understand why very little of the investment money is being directed towards actually developing bitcoin.
I'm still struggling to understand what people actually think is going to happen as the inflationary mining subsidies dry up if there isn't a massive increase in fees and why this doesn't seem to be more of a concern.
In regards to these specific regulations, I think that regardless of which way it goes, something shinier will pop up and nobody will really talk about it much any more as they chase the moon somewhere else. This is basically what happens to every problem bitcoin faces that inspires brief community outrage, hence the "added to the wiki, problem solved" joke that always pops up.

Overstock's post day one bitcoin sales average based on the two week numbers was ~$28k.
BitPay is still hyping their November numbers. Based on their own press releases on their now mysteriously deleted blog, the majority of last year had &lt;700 transactions a day, with an average monthly transactions per merchant rate of &lt;2.
Based on the chart they posted, which again, has mysteriously vanished, and their CEO's statements to the press, it is likely their December numbers are worse than October.
I don't have to cover my eyes, because it is not happening in any real way when the media isn't watching. Again, these are based on actual numbers, rather than your weird fantasy world.

A "bitcoin" isn't a thing. It is an arbitrary name given to a specific number of base units. There is no way to divide the base units. You can only increase the number of them and then change the definition of what a "bitcoin" is.

Again, you don't understand what an atomic unit is, or what "dividing" it implies.
Let's use the defacto example that gets brought up, and assume a pizza is the atomic unit. You cannot slice a pizza. The pizza community has arbitrarily decided that 10 million pizzas equal one bitpizza. Oh no, the current supply of bitpizzas is not enough :(
Being that you can't slice a pizza, because it is the atomic unit, the only option is to create a whole shitload more pizzas and pretend that now a bitpizza is equal to 100 million pizzas and hope nobody notices.

a business being profitable (and i don't know what their balance sheet looks like) doesn't really have much to do with them being mainstream or doing a ton of business. their released transaction volume figures are miniscule. their transaction volume before the holiday shopping seasons was &lt;700 transaction a day. their biggest shopping day of the year was ~6000. 


why would someone who was worried about a stable safe place to store their money choose bitcoin? honest question.


i really don't see how, and you haven't really given any reasons that actually support that. if the banking system collapses on a massive scale, the fact that bitcoin exists doesn't really affect anybody, and had nothing to do with bitcoin existing.


it is rather far fetched, in the context of this conversation.

I think out of the last 5328 tips on reddit, only 226 of them have been picked up outside of crytpo subreddits or moth to flame FREE BITCOINS threads.
So I think you should add a third group, which is nearly all of the actual tip recipients, which would be "if we human centipede enough tips and say viral enough, maybe it will become true!"
The reality is that the "wow" camp that you are referring to appears to be so small that it doesn't really matter.

Other than a few people who are mostly now banned, nobody would accept that it was a bubble when it was happening, even after it was clearly popping until fairly recently. This weird cargo cult bubble cycle thing didn't start until well after the fact. The huge turnover in posters and the desire to have a narrative that is positive for bitcoin has lead to all manner of weird theories that are equivalent to islanders building runways and wooden airplanes to summon the glorious gifts from the sky again.
It is fucking weird as hell, honestly.
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:01:48
It really depends. Your android comparison isn't really accurate. It is more like reading an article talking about a stock that you should totally invest in (because this company is going to change the world, I tell you!) written by a person who is invested in that stock..and then that person calls you a troll when you question their objectivity.
I think if you've disclosed your investment, you sort of just have to accept that it might color some people's interpretation of the sales pitch that comes afterwards.
It isn't really different than the only other comment currently in this thread that says

Their effect on the market has been steadily decreasing except for the several aborted pump efforts over the last six months that are blatantly obvious on the charts and that culminated in the flurry of 700 coin buy orders that finally juiced the price back out of the doldrums.

Okay, I trust you can take the rest from there. If not, let me know, I'm here to help.


Well, you see, if you take the same number of transactions in a unit, and then increase the price of each unit a ridiculous amount while keeping transaction numbers steady, you end up with hilarious news items like that.

This would be true if the hash rate increase didn't also necessarily lead to the consolidation of mining power, which it has, and which will only get worse as individuals are priced out. 
edit: just as an example, the freakout about ghash closing on 51% the other day...~45% of their capacity was coming from their own hardware. A quick glance at the mining subreddit will show the general advice to anybody looking to get into mining is either "don't" or "mine altcoins." This is the opposite of making things more secure. The hash rate does not make the network more secure if it is being done by fewer and fewer organizations.

Because they are newly issued shares? 
It decreases price because now there are 1000 tokens representing the same value that 500 tokens used to represent. 
It is probably pointless trying to shoehorn analogies onto this, though, because bitcoin is a weird mix between money and stocks.
I think to really grasp the concept here, you need to examine the reasons why something like this would be required for bitcoin, and then compare and contrast with inflationary economic policy, as well as things like stock splits.
The thing to realize, though, is that it would be a substantial increase in the monetary supply.

If you are going to consider "a very small percentage" as "bad" then we should probably consider merchant fraud in bitcoin, since bitcoin basically reverses the risk.


We don't have to predict 100 years out. The next block halving is not 100 years out. You can get a fairly good picture of what the transaction cost is now.
It might help if you attempt to base your worldview and arguments on something other than edge cases and anecdotes, but that is just a suggestion.

Don't get me wrong, I understand that the human brain's natural reaction when confronted with is to do whatever it can to disassociate itself from the horrors being inflicted upon it with every new post that appears, but here we are. 
Other than that, I don't really care what you say as long as you aren't secretly deleting comments any more, but I'm still going to make fun of your posts because they are really bad even by bitcoin standards. 
In the end, we all just want our posts to be free.

There is a reason that most businesses do not antagonize their consumers. Bitcoin, in a large number of ways, is incredibly consumer antagonistic.

That's true. There is hardly any actual discussion here, which is hilariously sad when many of the bitcoin bigwigs have reddit accounts and are willing to engage people directly here, and basically nobody is even interested enough to take advantage of it.


By "we" you are excluding all the people here who obviously don't agree with you.

This is such a dumb argument, and deep down, you know it is. Proportionally to transaction volume, the bitcoin network is not efficient in any way, and it grows more inefficient by the day. It wasn't meant to be efficient, it was meant to be decentralized (though this is slowly being eaten away at, anyway), which comes at the cost of efficiency.

This will probably sound mean, but are you a retarded person?
You see, shitting out bitcoins at a steady rate with no regard for demand means that in times of high demand, the price will become abnormally high, and in times of low demand, the price will become abnormally low.
If you apply basic human thought processes, you will see that the latter is where we are now at, and when taken together with the former, is what humans refer to as "volatility."

@_date: 2014-03-19 02:04:08
The obvious difference, that you are desperately skirting around, is that as opposed to the actual monetary supply which grows with the economy, bitcoin is fixed.

"To that effect we are in the process of arranging contact to the leading mining pools and Bitcoin Foundation to propose a ‘round table’ meeting of the key players with the aim of *discussing* and negotiating collectively ways to address the decentralisation of mining as an industry"

Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt. The only time I really collect an abnormal amount of downvotes is when a dumb post that I made fun of accidentally goes to the front page, when I post irrefutable numbers that must be buried at all costs, or when my collection of creepy stalkers gets out of hand.
I actually get quite a number of PM's from people who enjoy my posting, which isn't surprising because I'm an incredible poster.
edit: correction, I do enjoy arguing on the internet. The buzzer was only in relation to the downvote collecting. You know me so well &lt;3

You think people are being paid to say mean things about bitcoin on this dumb subreddit. You are possibly one of the dumbest posters here.
Now that we have metagen and gonzobon (a guy who is angry he can't be paid less than the minimum wage he currently earns) on one thread, maybe we could get CalvinHouse in here to talk about jacking off and losing money and it would be the dumbest comment thread in history.

Yes, that is my understanding of it. If a post has 10 upvotes and 5 downvotes, for a total score of 5, reddit may display it as 20-15, or 6-1, or 25-20.

One of the mods here posted an interesting page on their site to track black friday bitcoin sales. I haven't really seen any numbers other than that. It looks like they had a fairly large drop off in percentage of bitcoin sales this year, but without knowing whether their cash/credit sales increased a great amount it is hard to draw any conclusions past that.
Hopefully some more places will release stats.

@_date: 2014-01-24 06:20:13
Overstock's sales dropped 80-90% after the first day.
For 9 or 10 months of last year, BitPay averaged &lt;2 transactions per merchant per month.

My opinion of this entire thing is mostly detached from how it should be implemented. This bitcoin community has been crowing about how finally having regulations catering to the "Wall Street money" was what was going to launch the moon rocket for months. 
I'm more than slightly confused at what people thought that was going to actually entail, and have posted/tweeted several times about what the likely outcome of inviting sharks into the kiddy pool was going to be, even using the favorite "bitcoin is the Internet!" analogy. It was received quite predictably.

Almost everyone who has bought bitcoins in the last six months will be throwing money in the toilet if they sell or use their coins, buying more during a long decline seems like a bad idea, and the price has flatlined so there is no incentive for the speculators to try to make money on volatility.

@_date: 2014-01-04 00:34:19


I don't even know how to reply to this, because it is so ridiculous on its face.


For very specific types of transactions, sure. For general commerce, it is unfixably horribly in a number of ways, which is one of the reasons almost nobody accepts it or uses it other than as a means of generating publicity.


They can accept it all they want, but there is very little commerce happening in bitcoin other than gambling, and swapping it back and forth on exchanges.


It isn't, though, except for overhyped edge cases that nobody cares about, and "oh well someone will build something on top of it that sound shockingly like reinventing an existing wheel, complete with the same problems bitcoin was supposed to fix!" as a response to its problems when used as an actual currency.


Why do you think it frustrates me? I think it is hilarious.


This simply isn't borne out by any of the available facts or figures.


The price of 1 BTC is literally the only thing that is relevant to most of the people who own bitcoins, or they would be spending them in numbers that weren't hilariously small.


A conclusion reached by absolutely no evidence you've provided. Good grief.


This is literally not why bitcoin is valuable.


You've provided no evidence of this, other than saying it several times.

I almost understand that. I have a massive RES tag list. 
But when you state an opinion, then take it back because you stated it to the wrong person, then re-take it back again, it almost seems like you are being disingenuous and just saying whatever you think will endear your opinion to the masses.
I think you'll find that I say the same shit to everyone, because I'm not trying to force a narrative, which is one of the reasons I'm one of the only perpetual dissenters here that isn't downvoted to the point of being post throttled.

Merchants think, "will the money I spend on offering this service be less than the additional profit I will collect as a result of offering it?"
Bitcoin is consumer antagonistic in key aspects of its fundamental design. There is not really a way to gloss over it or fix it, without adding on escrows, mediators, insurers, incentives, and a host of other services, which will necessarily be funded by additional fees, eliminating the price advantage while still being less convenient than traditional existing payment options.

haha, what? It is a miner subsidy paid for by planned inflation of the bitcoin supply. Some of the earliest criticisms of bitcoin during Satoshi's early mailing list discussions were regarding concerns that nobody would adopt such an inflationary currency.
At some point the bitcoin community latched on to the fact that it would stop being printed eventually and started pretending that it was deflationary now.
Your bitcoins are being diluted every ten minutes to pay for the costs of running the network. It is very expensive, and if the price doesn't go up up up with the halvings, you're going to either see miners turning off their hardware, or fees going to the moon. This isn't some crazy opinion of dissent, this is basically the same thing Hearn said.

I've met loads of sane, interesting bitcoin people over the last year (mainly stemming from my quest for non-bullshit BitPay numbers), the vast majority of who also have a sense of humor. 
I think you'll also find that my personal criticisms are directed at specific people or companies more often than not.


No, my framing implies that much like it is made up of an entire cast of characters, some more extreme, annoying, or unfunny than others.

love callout threads are just as awful as hate callout threads, honestly. people focusing on usernames and tone rather than content is a large part of why this is a problem in the first place.
unfortunately, while reddit allows you infinity accounts, making new accounts to post dissent is useless, because reddit punishes you for negative karma.

Not really. There was a massive push for mbtc right before things fell off a cliff, which is why bitcoinity is left awkwardly using it, then endless debates over "mikes" and all number of other weird ideas. 
Then bitpay decided on bits and here we are. 
You can confirm this fairly easily by just looking at old posts, or realizing that Bruce's blog about the issue posted in another comment was two weeks after the bitpay announcement. 
Bits was another "organic" decision based on a marketing campaign.

Sucks for you because I was posting here for almost a year before I got butted.

In addition to being serious about this  I was also being serious about making your bot do something that is actually useful in protecting people from scams by looking for 0 day accounts or month old accounts with no previous activity.
But hey, why do something useful when you can be a passive aggressive robo-stalking bot spammer, I guess.

Just FYI this is why people are going to stop accepting bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 05:15:56
I'm sorry, what does it matter what country the exchanges were in? This is an international decentralized unregulated wonder we are talking about. 
I'm going to assume by your answer that you actually know I'm right, because you clearly don't have an explanation for why this miraculous cornucopia of bitcoin exchanges didn't appear to compete in the country that hosted Gox.

You are still struggling to avoid the problem, which is that you smugly replied to my comment with "reductio ad absurdum" as if that discredited it in some way, because you clearly thought that it was a type of logical fallacy. 
I know this, you know this, so I'm pretty sure we are done here, because you're obviously incapable of admitting the obvious.

It is funny to watch the attempts at establishing a narrative that will stick that occur every time bitcoin drops into the shitter.

I would wager that I know more about bitcoins than most of the posters here. I've read pretty much everything available from 2009 onwards.
I'm not sure what that has to do with anything, though, other than you are still mad about that time we argued in the "let's make a spam robot to post about trolls" thread.

The continued awkward silence of consumer adoption.
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:45:50
Well, something does change. The supply of money increases. Assuming that this change was made because one satoshi was worth too much "actual money" to be useful, this is increasing the money supply to account for increased demand.
This is basically controlled inflation, though if you want to pretend it is merely increasing divisibility that doesn't exist on the protocol level, ok.
@_date: 2014-06-10 19:03:03
I posted this in one of the other threads, but it looks like they just barely missed a 13 streak earlier. 
Oh well. It was on the front page yesterday and Andreas said it was no biggie, so it is as good as solved as far as reddit is concerned.

@_date: 2014-01-18 06:08:37


Wow, that's strange. BitPay certainly seems to feel it is a very important number. So much so that they mention it in nearly all their press releases. How weird!


Well, I was kind enough to provide you with actual numbers. I'm sure you will return the favor. The keyword "probably" makes me think that this won't be forthcoming.


Well, I'm glad that the only number that you feel matters is the one that you think you can make some sort of last stand on. Unfortunately for you, those numbers are absolutely dismal, and the November numbers were pumped up by the massive promotion around the bitcoin Black Friday. You will notice I mentioned this, and also mentioned the strange lack of December numbers. 
Q1 2014 will be the numbers that "really count."


I mean, I posted the numbers, man. They are right there. You are replying to them. Those numbers are fucking horrible by any stretch of the imagination, which is why BitPay (and in a moment, you) like to talk in percentages rather than actual numbers, and why I had to dig them out.
They did less than 700 transactions a day for the majority of last year. Much less for most of it. For the majority of last year the average for their merchants was less than 1.5 transactions a month. During their biggest, most hyped, most inflated month, they processed 1800 transactions a day, and even that number is wildly out of wack, because 6200 of those were on one day.
Nobody is buying anything. These numbers are a rounding error in the grand scheme of things, regardless of how you want to try to bob and weave and obfuscate.
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:56:10
It is slightly surprising that there doesn't seem to be more concern about the mining industry. 
The general advice given out is that it isn't profitable and people shouldn't buy hardware. The hardware companies seem to either be outright scams or are moving towards a rental model where the customer never sees the hardware and will likely never make a profit, or in many cases, a combination of the two. 
There doesn't seem to be a lot of thought given to what the end result of this is going to be. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:43:40

I was mostly referring to the broken clusterfuck of exchanges rather than the thriving industry that has sprung up letting you conveniently turn cash into bitcoins into less convenient cash. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 14:54:44
Consumers have so far rejected enhanced solutions to security over convenience, pretty much across the board. 
Merchants may have issues with credit cards, but outside of a few specific high risk industries (porn) chargeback fraud is not as big of an issue as it is made out to be here.  If a merchant is not being forced into a high risk processor, you can be fairly certain they have a very low level of chargebacks.

I don't hate bitcoin. The technology could have been interesting, and maybe still will some day, but the community is completely rotten from the top down and has (in my opinion, obviously) completely ruined any chance of that.
Which is where my interest in bitcoin comes in. I like weird internet communities. I enjoy wrecking scammers, and I dislike sharks disguised as true believers circling around actual true believers for financial gain.
I don't really care if bitcoin succeeds or not. I post for my own entertainment, and hopefully serve as a pin jabbing into the side of the bubble.

You need to learn how to extract actual numbers from press releases. 
~200k day one. ~300k the next 13 days. This is at best a 90% drop in sales. At best, because that assumes 200k the first day, and then an equal volume on each subsequent day. In reality, it is more likely a steady drop, which means that current day to day sales are probably MUCH lower than the best case 23k a day. 
This is basically statistical noise. People don't spend bitcoins when there is no media watching, which has played out again and again. Please see any of my previous breakdowns of bitpay stats for confirmation.

You're not going to do it with bitcoin unless the price dumps enough to shake the top end out. It has little to do with the viability of the technology, though there are obviously issues with that, as well.

I mean, I've typed them out numerous times. When I repeat information or arguments repeatedly, people yell at me for that. There is really no winning in this situation, which is fine, because I just post whatever is interesting or entertaining to me at any given time. 


This really isn't a use case for consumers engaging in transactions that are not illicit/embarrassing. Bitcoin, in general, is incredibly consumer antagonistic compared to other payment methods.


Is there any information or hard data on contributions from these companies? Would legitimately like to see it.


The problem with changes like this is that existing statistics show that nodes are very reluctant to upgrade. For instance, parsing the json dump from getaddr.bitnodes.io results in over a third of the network still running on 0.8.
0.8: 2595
0.9: 4670
Other: 3


Possible, but not based on any sort of history of how the bitcoin community reacts to things. Which lobbying groups are you referring to, and more importantly, who is paying them?


That is not a good use for me, because I don't care if bitcoin is successful or not. My posting is all personal enjoyment/interest based. The weird behind the scenes things that get sent my way fairly often keep me coming back to see what happens next.
edit: corrected miners to nodes.

Yes, truly, what is wrong with "these people" who invested their savings into homes, the value of which is decreased by the presence of a hobo camp.
"these people."
I mean, helping the homeless is a noble cause, but pigeonholing people who are going to get fucked financially by the hobo camp down the road as "these people" who have something wrong with them, is a little messed up.
"Among the complaints from the residents were claims that the camp’s residents roamed the neighborhood’s alleys at night, burned open fires, and had approached and talked to children living at nearby properties."
"King said that Sean’s Outpost had not received a cease and desist order, only a notice of violation.
Two notices of violation, one issued
Jan. 7 and another issued Jan. 14, were posted on Massachusetts Avenue in front of the property Sunday. They listed a total of eight code violations ranging from erecting a structure without a permit to maintaining a condition conducive to the breeding of rats, mosquitoes and other vermin."
"Dough-Castro said Sean’s Outpost could face court fees and daily fines if found to be in violation of county code by special magistrate. If violations persist, the county has the authority to place a lien on the property."

I don't agree with the entirety of your posts, but I think, and have said before, that "things you don't want on your credit card statement" is one of the few actual situations where bitcoin makes a lot of sense. 
In general this has been in response to people parroting the catchphrase that bitcoin will either be worth a fortune or worth zero.
There are a number of niche applications for something like bitcoin that play to its actual advantages instead of its imaginary ones. Unfortunately, they are mostly things that people don't want to be associated with.

Right, but presently, and for the foreseeable future, the energy requirements scale up regardless of the number of transactions. They don't need to be linked, and in fact aren't. 
The argument is that this massive and ever increasing energy output solving busy work puzzles is securing the network, but the end result (as also predicted in 2009) is the consolidation of mining into large datacenter operators, which as the recent ghash hullabaloo shows, isn't necessarily making things more secure, and in fact introduces its own set of problems.

Yes, again, this article is a result of poor security at a place that consumers trusted with their private information. This is no different than what has happened at untold numbers of vanishing bitcoin companies, except that in the case of Gox, they had also handed over enough information to steal their entire identity.
The other difference is that all of the credit card users will be sent new cards, reimbursed for any losses, and likely given free credit monitoring. Hilariously, after Gox happened, bitcoin users were piggybacking on the offer from the Target breach for free credit monitoring.

@_date: 2014-05-30 02:23:41
I'm not trying to get an emotional reaction from you. I'm trying to get you to follow your own conversation.
600k is a cumulative number, from the Overstock bitcoin launch to the NY hearings. 20% of that $600k was on the first day. If they sold the same amount on every day thereafter, their ongoing sales would have dropped to 18% of the big media blitz. By the time they announced one million in sales, it was down to 10%.
Bitcoin sales have gone from 1% of their revenue to less than 0.1% in the short time they have been offering the option. Much like the Dish threads from today, the Overstock launch threads were full of people saying things like "I don't need anything and I don't really want any of their products, but gosh, this is HUGEEEEE so I'm going to buy a thing!" This seems to be repeated over and over again, as evidenced by the threads about people going to a place listed on coinmap only to find out that they stopped accepting bitcoins as soon as they media stopped caring. It cuts both ways.
The moral of this story is that nobody spends bitcoins unless the media is watching and it has some chance of driving up the price of bitcoins.
I'm sorry if this hurts your feelings.

There isn't much point in picking the few posts from the end of a previous price drop where people called it all the way down, because clearly the last person to call the bottom before the price stopped dropping will be omg right.

Software made by the largest companies in the world still has bugs. Software made by the largest open communities in the world still have bugs. Even the bitcoin software itself has had horrible bugs (like the day of 180 million bitcoins).
Now, you might say, "well there are flaws in the current system!" The difference is that the current system isn't trying to depend solely on technology to solve every business problem, and thus there is generally a way for consumers to enjoy protection even if there is breech or critical software issue.
With bitcoin, one bug, one lapse in judgement, one brush with malware, a typo, clicking on the wrong thing...will cause you to irreversibly lose all your money, with no recourse. You can attempt to recreate the existing system, but with bitcoin, but at that point, what reason exists to use bitcoin?
Bitcoin is an overengineered solution to problems nobody was having, and that introduces brand new critical problems that nobody wants to deal with. 
When you couple that with the fact that there is nothing inherently special to bitcoin when compared to the mountains of altcoins...
That's why in the "long run" it will fail.

Jesus you are an idiot.
You have a bitcoin. You have $800. You want to buy something worth $800. You can just spend your cash, and save the bitcoin, or you can spend the bitcoin, and eat the spread buying it back.
None of the other shit matters. I don't know why this is so complicated. You are going to eat the spread every single time you buy and spend a bitcoin.
If you just hang on to your coins, and spend your cash, this does not happen. It doesn't matter how long you hold them, or how much the value goes up or down. You're going to eat the spread. 
I'm not sure how else I can explain this to you, because you seem fairly dense.

The biggest issue occurs when you remove the payment processor rep, the strong arm of the fair owner, and the crowd of people who are only buying things because they can use bitcoin.
What are you left with at that point? You are left with the sporadic posts you see here where people go to a place that used to accept bitcoin and find that nobody knows what they are talking about because they stopped accepting bitcoin when the press stopped sniffing around, because the only people using bitcoin there also stopped spending there when the press stopped sniffing around.
You see the same pattern in even the larger merchant numbers.

@_date: 2014-01-06 05:03:14
It is unlikely based on the current system. It will probably get worse as rewards decrease. There is very little financial incentive to sell mining hardware that produces a larger return by just running it. There is also very little incentive to not exploit a community of starry eyed true believers who have demonstrated an unwavering willingness to dump money into questionable "investments" over and over again. 
At some point maybe people will stop giving money to them, but it shows no sign of slowing. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:07:11
You can spin it however you want, but that doesn't change the fact that it is ridiculous and just more overblown rhetoric that is aimed at the true believers rather than the regulators, because anybody who isn't a bitcoin enthusiast is likely going to see this as ridiculous.

The problem is that it doesn't incentive people to buy it. It just provides another avenue for the people who obtained their piles of Bitcoin at a tiny fraction of the current price to cash out while the people who came late hold their bags for them wondering when the price will go back up.

Because it will make them less money than listening to feedback from people who actually spend money at their business?
The number of people who spend bitcoins is minuscule. The number of people who spend bitcoins on normal products outside of an event where the media is paying attention and might attract more bitcoin buyers is even smaller. 
I posted a breakdown of BitPay numbers the other night, and it is just not even worth bothering with for a company outside of the benefit of maybe having the local news show up.

Usually if I get downvoted, it is because of my username.


The distribution of bitcoin is hilarious. Satoshi, someone who by some accounts left bitcoin because of the gross community, owns almost 10% of all the bitcoins on earth. This is a problem. One of the other "richest" bitcoin enthusiasts moderates two of the largest bitcoin discussion forums. Several of the richest were accessories if not promoters to blatant scams. The interest has nothing to do with wanting more people to use bitcoin because it is useful.


If you are a bitcoin owner and concerned about this, you better get cracking on the solution, because all indications are that it is only going to get worse.


There hasn't really been any gigantic dumps on the exchanges, either. The order books are shallow as fuck. Satoshi coming back and dumping, however unlikely, could clean out Gox to zero several times over. If Wall Street comes and plays on the exchanges with a spread wide enough to drive a truck through, welp. 


Ignoring the fact that he is one of the worst posters here, posting one the most common logical fallacies posted here, with no other evidence that bitcoin is comparable to the internet...actually, there is no way to ignore any of those things.

You're right. I can't know for certain, because most of the large holders who are publicly active are sketchy as fuck. 


Yes. Bitcoin. You are basically making my point for me, here. There is nothing inherently superior about bitcoin. By clinging to this brand of cryptocoin for financial reasons, you are depressing the exploration of alternatives. Thus, you see the continuously rehashed arguments about how dumb "copycoins" are, and how all of the terrible problems with bitcoin will be solved eventually by somebody.


Again, what is the advantage of making bitcoin 'sticky' other than 'I have a lot of bitcoins.' That is exactly the problem.


With all due respect, I know, and don't really care. I post jokes, and I post solid information. For example, have you noticed that BitPay deleted their entire blog with all the shameful numbers I've been crunching here in the last few days? I wonder why they did that? Weird.

The problem is that the bitcoin community has chosen its superstars who spearhead this ridiculous dialog on social and traditional media, and they are all embarrassing shills who use liberty rhetoric to get a pass on acting like corrupt assholes while they shovel money into their gaping maws.

Sorry, perhaps my use of the word accidental doesn't make a lot of sense without having followed the previous attempts at this. It is much like the occasional bitcoinmarkets post where a poster salivates over "new money."
The post itself wasn't accidental. It is accidental honesty in the sense that it is someone posting honestly in opposition to the carefully cultivated narrative that has been constructed that doesn't involve greed or personal enrichment..

I'm only insulting you because you are saying things that are stupid.
Supply is static. Demand fluctuates wildly. In a normal monetary system, the supply would be elastic. This is merely one of the reasons why Satoshi's system is dumb for anything other than allowing him to gobble up a giant portion of the monetary supply and then vanish.
Demand has dropped since the price skyrocketed because, and I know this may come as a shock, very few people actually care about or use bitcoins for anything other than a speculative investment. The moon talk faded as people cashed out and the bubble popped. Then the bubble theorists faded as it became clear even to the true believers that they were talking shit. Now the "wall street is coming" hangers on cling to the dream while the ever present pump and dumps flow like piss.
The VC's dumping money into bitcoin related companies are ramping up the pumping talk lately, so there will likely be another drum up of demand leading into the holiday season, followed by another unloading of coins that nobody actually wants.
I hope this clears things up, buddy.

@_date: 2014-05-04 04:01:50


Sort of.
With the millibits spam fest a few months ago, the idea was that "a millibit is just a buck!" A person would be more likely to say, "well, if it is only a buck, then it wouldn't be out of line to pay TWO bucks for a millibit!" whereas someone seeing $1000 for a bitcoin is going to be a lot harder to convince to pay $2000 for one.
Meanwhile, the people who sit on piles of bitcoins eagerly await for the new money to be fooled and increase the value of their coins. Unfortunately, what actually happened was shortly after they finally convinced bitcoinity to change to millibits, the price went off a cliff and we had to deal with loads of "maybe we should change back to btc" posts.
edit: until bitpay started pushing this dumb scheme and gosh, I have no idea why they would be doing this now.
The one constant is that bitcoin enthusiasts are gullible, greedy, and easily manipulated.

It comes from dumping the raw 24h data from bitcoincharts.com into excel and clicking the chart button. I'm not sure how it is at odds with anything, because it matches what you'd have seen if you looked at the market volumes over the last couple of months. Right before the recent pump stamp 24h volume was ~1600btc, which you have to go back to 11 days at the beginning of 2013 to find a comparable number. This is not the first time this year that this has been the case.

Consider a satoshi as an atom, and bitcoins, mbtcs, etc, as molecules of various sizes. 
You can split the molecules into atoms, but you cannot split an atom and end up with smaller atoms. That is essentially bitcoin. 
If you want to give the appearance increasing the divisibility of bitcoins, the only way to do that is to create a shitload more atoms and change the names that you refer to the various molecules by.

I'm not actually sure what you are trying to say here. Are you referring to hardware when you say "miners" or are you referring to human beings?
If you are referring to hardware, that isn't necessarily true.


Again, let's use CEX as an example. They have mining hardware. They rent hashpower to someone. That person can sell it to whoever they want, who can sell it to yet another person. How is any due diligence being done on the final owner of this hashpower, again?

I do not enjoy cheap beer, but cheap vodka (preferably dumped into a vat of diet grape soda)is ok. Dogfish Head 90 minute is my favorite beer, followed by Lagunitas IPA.
I think cryptocurrency probably has some future, but not bitcoin. I don't think it will destroy either banks or western union. I think it is unlikely that any significant number of consumers are going to deal with the inherent antagonistic properties of a bitcoin-like currency.

I'm lumping them in because they should be lumped in, because the cost of mining  approaches the reward for mining.
Edit: the cost of the reward is paid for by diluting the value of coins people already hold through inflating the supply. The fact that it is obfuscated doesn't make it any less of a cost, nor does it change the fact that if it doesn't get paid, miners will leave and network security will decrease. This has happened with any number of alt coins already, so it isn't a theoretical thing.

The thing is that changetip doesn't use any financial system. It is the equivalent of people sending baseball cards to a random guy on the internet who keeps track of people's emails detailing their baseball card trades by dropping them into different buckets and (come January) will charge you 1% to get your cards back.
The fact that it is bitcoin instead of baseball cards is irrelevant, because changetip has basically nothing to do with bitcoin outside of their ingenious method of convincing bitcoin enthusiasts to post their spam all over popular social media sites.

I was curious mainly because their PR person seemed to have just started there, and tipping in this subreddit has been mostly frowned upon until the other day when things went bananas. 
Unfortunately reddit api limits prevent me from grabbing the data during the initial mega tip blast so I don't have any way of grabbing the users that started it. The entire thing stinks of trying to AstroTurf a viral marketing campaign before fees kick in, though. 
I've been trying to come up with a decent way to pull Twitter stats, but it is more difficult. I think you'll find that Twitter user m3metic has a disproportionate number of tip attempts. 
Anyway, will post updates after I've got more data.

Investing 11k in something that has only had one week of closing higher than it started, which was almost entirely one pump, in three months, is a terrible idea. 
This is especially true when the only reason it got to the price it did is potentially shutting it down in two weeks.

They released numbers several times in the run up to 1 million. It was possible to track it fairly closely. I posted a lot of comments crunching their numbers, TD numbers, and BitPay's hilarious numbers.

Reason 1: wishful thinking, basically, that people aren't buying into.
Reason 2: Again, not really happening in any real way. Wishful thinking that people aren't buying into.
Reason 3: People beg places to take donations and then complain about them as soon as the PR burst wears off without the price going up. Basically the same as they do to merchants.
Reason 4: This is actually one of the few use cases for bitcoin.
Reason 5: There aren't exactly people clamoring to use bitcoin for this, etiher, and there isn't a lot of reason not to come up with a different system without all the baggage that bitcoin drags along with it if this is something that businesses desire.
Reason 6: this isn't specific to bitcoin at all.

I enjoy your posting, but I disagree with you here. I feel you are missing the key element, which is that recruiting new people is the only thing keeping the pyramid from collapsing, because the product being sold has no value other than generating profits down the chain. 
The people at the top of the chain sell down to new recruits, who then must find someone to sell their product to, or be stuck sitting on a useless product. The fact that the payments run up through shady manipulated exchanges rather than being handled at say, a booster event, doesn't really make much of a difference, because they are functionally identical. 
A quick glance at BitPay's transaction numbers makes it pretty clear that people aren't buying bitcoins to use as a currency, because it is terrible for that task. 
So I'm not sure what better term for a system wherein early adopters get rich by charging new recruits for a product that is not valuable for anything but selling to yet more new recruits is, wherein the lack of new recruits to buy in at a premium from the level above them is.
Seems like a pyramid to me.

Well, he was voted in by people who paid the bitcoin foundation. If you want someone else to represent you on the bitcoin foundation, you have to give them money. If you don't want to give them money, like any sane person, your only recourse is convincing people that these people don't represent the bitcoin community.
The problem is that they pay the lead dev, and nearly every bitcoin developer, company, and luminary, is a paying member. You can imagine that this makes it more difficult to convince people that they don't represent the bitcoin community. 
At that point, all you're really left with is realizing that the community leaders don't really give a shit about the community.

I mostly dislike bitcoin, the rotten from the top community of sharks happily fleecing starry eyed idealists and greedy but less than savvy investors, but there are plenty of practical problems with bitcoin the currency and bitcoin the network in its current state.

I spent weeks "explaining stuff" in regards to BitPay and Overstock numbers, and got accused of trolling. Only the other day, the overstock CEO came on reddit and confirmed everything I'd been saying about their dropoff in bitcoin sales, to the exact percentage. BitPay, meanwhile, has never clarified their conflicting statements, and stopped releasing transaction numbers entirely.
People are going to complain that I'm trolling no matter what I post. Sometimes I feel like posting jokes. Sometimes I feel like shitting on scammers. Sometimes I'll post about numbers or weird market things.

If you look at the changetip stats that got posted the other day, you will see that the bulk of tipping is done by pantera and changetip employee accounts. The lone exception to the biggest circles on that chart is Kyle Kemper.

I've accumulated hundreds of karma points from posting here, and get called a troll all the time. If the purpose of your bot is to quash dissent (which seems to be the main criteria used for shouting troll at people here), it would fail miserably in the face of my excellent posts.
ps censorship is fucking retarded, and letting robots do it is even more retarded, and the combination of these two facts makes me think you are retarded.
edit: if you actually wanted to help the subreddit, you'd have a bot that displayed the account age of posters, because 90% of the scammers posting here have accounts that are either 1 month and X days, or 0 days. but that would actually be helpful, rather than vindictive, so fuck it.

Because they sell preorders to get the money to build the hardware, "test" it by mining them for a while, and then delivering late after they are no longer very profitable.
In other instances, they take preorders, use the money to build miners that they fill their datacenter with, and then rent access to their datacenter and give some free leased mining time to people who got their hardware late.
So basically, like most things in bitcoin, it is probably a scam of some sort.

There's a flaw in the bitcoin protocol where the transaction ID field is actually changeable by random people. Despite being an obvious bug, that has been acknowledged by basically everyone as being an obvious bug, and despite there being plans to FIX the obvious bug, now that the bug has actually become a problem, the community has rallied to insist that it isn't a bug, and throw another bitcoin foundation member under the bus for daring to speak ill about bitcoins.
You'll notice that Gox being completely and obviously fucked and wrecking bitcoin over and over again did not produce any real outrage from luminaries until bouncy ball boy suggested that there was a problem with bitcoin.

You have to take the paper in combination with the early mailing list posts, before the absolute weirdness took over.
For example: "Another factor that would mitigate spam if POW tokens have value:
there would be a profit motive for people to set up massive
quantities of fake e-mail accounts to harvest POW tokens from
spam.  They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with
automated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the
message.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become
too high for spam to be cost effective. "
This is what Satoshi envisioned bitcoin to be.
edit edit: my fav "The Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to 
generating bitcoins instead.
Satoshi Nakamoto"
edit: "If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website.  "Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally.""

I would suggest starting by not trying to sell bitcoin as the savior of the universe and the end of our oppressive lives as slaves to fiat, and maybe instead talk about it as it actually is irl. 
I realize this won't pump up the faithful, but it might actually interest someone who had heard about bitcoin but who hasn't already consumed gallons of kool aid and / or is not a crazy person looking to be hard sold on unrealistic delusions of hopes and dreams. Your current presentations engender the reaction of someone who has been pulled off the escalator in Vegas to be hard sold on a time share deal. 
YMMV. 
Edit: seriously. They make me want to escape like I'm trapped on an elevator with a Ron Paul advocate. 
edit edit: I know I'm like a negative Nancy or whatever around here, but if you want to sell bitcoin to people who aren't sold on bitcoin, go back and read some of Satoshi's old posts. He wasn't shilling, or hard selling. He was like, "here's this thing I made, let's think of cool things to do with it."

Don't invest in bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-28 07:19:14
I think the situation since January has gone a long way towards showing that heavily invested bitcoin holders will cling to bitcoins regardless of potential problems. You had a bitcoin dev who actually did cash out part of his stash with a lengthy explanation of why, and he was derided as a shill for no apparent reason other than his words might make the price go down. You've had another dev saying that development is basically at a standstill and, shockingly, he was also torn apart. 
So now there is this odd situation where nothing is being done about an actual problem, and even talking about the fact that there is a problem is shouted down. This is not indicative of a group of people who are going to jump ship when a problem actually manifests as something more than theoretical.

The discussions a few months ago that culminated in bitcoinity changing to mbtc right around the time things went over the cliff were very clearly being pushed because it would make new investors more likely to buy in. The stupid catchphrase that got spammed here over and over again ( much like "cheap coins!" is now) was "mbtc, it's only a buck!" Most of the conversations by the big pushers focused on new money and the psychological effect that would bring it in. 
This is really no difference. Read the comments. It is nothing but condescending opinions of how stupid the average person in and the psychological benefits of obfuscating the actual price. It is just a repeat of the last go round except the decimal has been shifted again and the name is even more intentionally confusing.

Hey, maybe you're right. My personal opinion is that people don't spend bitcoins unless there is a chance of media attention to bring in new money and more media and drive up the price of their coins. 
This has basically been the case based on the numbers I have seen. 
But that's why I keep crunching all the numbers that I see released. I thought numbers and math were what the bitcoin world believes in, but the downvotes I get for posting them, and the ever changing explanations for them, would seem to imply otherwise.

It is honestly probably worse than that in a non-averaged reality, because their reported big sales bumps were from a few very specific industries (mining hardware, precious metals, gift cards).
If he isn't interested in bitcoin for some ideological reason, or for the brief free publicity, there's really not a lot of business cases to support bothering with it at this point.

If you are mad that the fed can keep printing money with no input from the public, why aren't you mad that the bitcoin network keeps printing money based on an arbitrary decision by some guy who doesn't want to even be involved with it any more, and conveniently quit after collecting the lion's share of the money?
It seems like wildly printing bitcoins with no monetary policy or concern for demand would be just as irritating to a concerned fellow like yourself. It seems silly to forever grumble about controlled expansion of the money supply when bitcoin has gone off the rails and lost 60% of its value since the beginning of the year. 
The only real difference is that you own a lot of bitcoins (minus the splurge on a 20 year old honda that barely fits in your garage and surely can't open the door even with your tape and blanket upgrade to the giant pole inexplicably in the middle of your parking area) and need people to keep buying 3600+ of them every day :(

Actually, the only reason those fees seem really low is because the miners are subsidized via printing large amounts of new bitcoins.
Much like credit card fees are subsidized by slightly raising the price of goods. The difference is that the miner subsidies are going to get ever smaller, and guess what that is going to mean for those incredibly cheap transactions.

No, the argument is that putting up arbitrary and easily defeated barriers that aren't going to help, just so you can feel like you are doing something is pointless and stupid.
This is basically the same argument given here day after day in regards to bitcoin regulatory actions and enforcement, so I'm not sure why it is apparently such a difficult concept.
The only two effective solutions are either an ever vigilant group of enforcers, which people will complain about, or for the people who are complaining to actually browse /new and downvote or report shit instead of hanging out on the front page mashing upvote on things already on the frontpage with headlines that sound good for bitcoin.

"inevitable" in the context of the rest of your post seems to be in regards to mass adoption of bitcoin by the global public. There are any number of reasons why this is not inevitable. It isn't impossible, but I think the window for it to actually happen is getting smaller by the day. As it stands now, the actual consumer uptake of bitcoin seems to be stalling, if not going backwards. If this doesn't change before the VC starts drying up, I don't think it is going to happen at all.

There are really only three options.

2) BitPay/Coinbase don't become very popular because nobody is spending bitcoins and their funding dries up.
3) People start spending bitcoin in some sufficient quantity that companies will pull things in house, possibly to avoid the inevitable fees in option 1.

The manufactured outrage against the proposed regulation was mainly stirred up by several early adopters (and hangers on) whose prominence was fading in the face of big actual money entering the scene. 
The ridiculous over the top rhetoric they spammed over the earth in the days immediately following the release effectively set the narrative, which was the goal. 
Unfortunately they also strained credulity in their effort to garner praise and recognition from frothing true believers (which was the actual goal), and drowned out honest concerns under a flood of idiocy.

Yes, none of the things you posted have much to do with whether or not it is a speculative bubble created by ...speculation. They would be ok arguments for "it hasn't popped yet," though.
Fundamentals, for a currency and payment system, would be things like "is anybody actually using this as a currency or payment system in numbers that justify the current price?" The answer to that question is "jesus no, not even close, and pretty much the opposite of that."

This is objectively incorrect.


Satoshi is the arbitrary name given to the atomic unit of the bitcoin currency. Let's call it a Carl. It doesn't matter. The number of Carls are what define the supply of the bitcoin currency. The decimals and fractions are a convenience. The terms mBTC, and BTC, and whatever other dumb names people have latched onto, are just a convenient way to refer to a collection of "base" bitcoin units, or Carls.
In order to give the illusion of allowing for more divisibility, what you are actually doing, is making a shitload more Carls and shuffling your naming scheme around to make it seem like you aren't just massively increasing the amount of bitcoins.

You'll notice that the most common argument is that alt coins do not offer anything over bitcoin because they are simply copies. 
Once you go down that road, it is only a short hop to realizing that the only actual advantage bitcoin has is a larger user base. This is why there is so much network effect parroting. 
Once you admit that to yourself, the only way to preserve your now shaky bitcoin investment is to make sure that nobody uses altcoins or talks about them in a positive unchallenged way, lest the network effect bestow its bounty on something you haven't sunk money into. 
Hope that helps.

Just because you are having difficulty understanding a concept does not mean that I'm trolling. That is such a cop out, and not really surprising. 
"bitcoins" and fractions thereof are a convenient way to reference and group the actual units, which are referred to as satoshis. When people say "there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins!" what that actually means is that there will only be 2,100,000,000,000,000 base units of this currency. There is no decimal to shift or thing to divide. All you can do is create more base units and pretend that it is not what you are doing in the hopes that people like yourself will be okay with it. 
For some reason people are ok with this, whereas if you phrased it as boosting the number of bitcoins to 210.000.000, people would cry and tell about inflation. In reality there is no actual difference.

I think a lot of the problem is that nobody here actually cares about bitcoins other than a sure fire get rich quick scheme, so despite the lip service about decentralization and the community and whatever, it always comes down to "well *someone* will surely do something about that at some point."
It doesn't matter if it is the block size limit, fixing the wiki, or making bitcoin totes easy for grandma to use. Someone will surely do it. At some point.

I'm not sure you can set 1% as a lower bound, though. That's just the rate on the free plan. If you're a larger business and doing between $30k-$300k/month, the flat $30/month plan would be more efficient and give BitPay less than 1%. In the higher end of that range, much less. The same gulf happens when you move up to the next segment.

Despite your capital letters, you've offered absolutely nothing to support your claim, or to counter the evidence I've actually provided you with.


It was more than a month, first of all. They hadn't hit $1 million at the time of the article you are referencing, second of all. That doesn't change the fact that their sales, and TigerDirect's sales, dropped off 90% after day one, when the media stopped caring. But again, that's just going by what's available.
BitPay's seemingly dismal December and fishy January are another matter entirely, but still support my side of the argument.

I'm curious how you examined what BTC was about and did not see this as an obvious end result. If not ghash.io, it will be someone else in the future.
Look at any post here or in the mining subreddit where someone says "can I mine?" The answer is always, "you're an idiot, just buy bitcoins, mining will lose you money."
And it isn't like it is going to get cheaper as the conglomerates finance ever more expensive hardware with preorders and the reselling of mining contracts and "cloud hashing."

This would be more convincing if the default response to questions about getting into mining wasn't "you will never make back your investment."
Much like the default response to questions about ten minute confirmations wasn't "it is totally fine for purchases smaller than a car."

@_date: 2014-02-14 03:00:24
I agree with most of this, except your assessment of the status quo. The implications aren't really slim to nonexistent, and it doesn't seem to be getting addressed in another way.
It is basically repealing all the advice that has been trumpeted in the bitcoin world about not worrying about accepting zero confirmation transactions for purchases smaller than a house.
The fix is the equivalent of putting a padlock on your wallet after every purchase.

The alternative is admitting that bitcoin has problems and that might make the price go down. That is basically the rationale behind most of the dumb things in this subreddit. 
That's why every time something bad happens, immediately after the initial blast of panic posts you'll see a blast of narrative steering attempts that try to explain why it is actually totally not a problem, and perhaps even a good thing!
Eventually one of those will stick and/or a wise bitcoin professional shill will bring the one true statement down from the mountain, and it becomes conventional wisdom which means you can angrily dismiss anybody who ever brings it up again as a troll or an idiot without having to actually put any actual thought into it. 
It happens basically every time.

The bitcoin market is tiny, not really growing in consumer demand, and full of unruly zealots, even at the highest level (see Roger Vers sad request to twitter bomb a supplier).
There is no reason for any company that isn't in desperate need of publicity to deal with this shit. 
I know it probably doesn't seem that way if you are deeply invested in the bitcoin concept, but the available facts don't point to any sort of adoption outside of ideological zealots and get rich quick speculators. Maybe that will change at some point, but it is the current reality. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:48:38


It also does not make it not a scam. Your response does nothing to address the actual concern he raised, which is valid, even if you don't agree with it.


The mining industry has been consolidated to an extreme degree. The two largest mining groups could force whatever change they wanted through, today.


This is a weird comment in light of the number of posts here about how the current banking/investment industries are terrified of bitcoin and want to destroy it. In light of that fantasy, your reply is not very soothing.

This is important to remember the next time someone talks about how bitcoin is infinitely divisible and how they can just change the code to allow smaller fractions. The "satoshi" is the atomic unit. Increasing divisibility is actually creating huge amounts of bitcoin out of thin air. 
It is rather hilarious how many people are totally okay with that, and yet rail against the fed printing money and crow about bitcoin being deflationary.
It is completely baffling until you remember that this is bitcoin, and it is all based on personal enrichment wrapped in the flag of misguided idealism.

@_date: 2014-06-14 02:03:09
I mean, there's nothing wrong with being excited about something new that seems interesting. It is interesting in many ways, as evidenced by my ever growing collection of posts. There's a chance that the corporate money going into it will salvage it from ruin by the collection of scumbags and kooks that latched onto it at the beginning and turn it into something workable that normal people may have some use for.
However, to an outside observer, there are so many red flags from the existing community, and looming problems with the existing technology, that it is hard to see that happening while still ending up with something that could be called "bitcoin."
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:20:57

The problem with your argument is that they did this in January and nothing really happened. They did this a few days ago and nothing really happened. Then they did it the next day and the price briefly dumped and then started going back up, and nothing really happened. 
I've said this more than once, but nobody really seems to care all that much. January happened, they put out a press release, nothing changed, and everyone stopped talking about it.
Even this time, people quickly turned to saying oh gosh nobody will get 51% stop posting about it. Then they did and it was oh nobody will do anything bad, stop posting about it. 
Then the price dipped briefly and everyone shit their pants. It will go back up and people will stop caring. All the solutions being proposed don't solve the actual problem, or even acknowledge that this is a fundamental problem not with ghash, but with the bitcoin model. Other than Peter Todd, the devs don't seem overly concerned. This was a problem six months ago, and nothing has been done. 
You see posts like this arguing about how they shouldn't do this thing because it goes against their long term financial interests, all the while the entire community sits on their hands in fixing the underlying issues. So much talk about "well unless there is a major problem found with the protocol!" Well here you go. The incentive system that is the backbone of bitcoin does not work as intended. The community itself is so heavily invested that they are the ones terrified of actually admitting the real problem out loud. So here we are.

people with negative karma aren't guaranteed to be trolling, as the multiple misfires of your bot should tell you.
most of darkwing's posts end up getting memory holed anyway, and he obviously gets downvoted in great numbers. so what is your bot doing? who else is it supposed to guard against? witcoins? most of the other people who get called trolls don't have negative karma.
at least trying for scammers is noble instead of petty.

I wasn't trying to compare them in that way, just that the bitcoin community, in general, seems to be incredibly gullible and ready to pour money into things that any sane person would run away from. Like bitcoin, I guess, which maybe explains a lot of it.


I'm really not comparing the two, but so was pirateat40, and so are lots of penny stock companies. haha. This, by itself, is not a very good indicator of anything.
The bitcoin community reminds me a lot of my time watching the MLM community. You'd see people get burned over and over again, and still eagerly hop onboard the next thing that came along, happily going bankrupt and and working hard to get rich quick and easy.
But again, I don't know anything about Neo&amp;Bee, and was really just making a general observation about this community rather than that company.

Cool, will do. Thanks.


Your phone is trying to tell you something...
The last 0.8 release was at the beginning of december, 2013. That was like eight months ago, and it isn't like there are a huge number of people running nodes. There are only like 7000 total.


Discounts, no. The discounts are going to fade if something isn't actually done about the cost of bitcoin transactions. This is something that is going to rear its head in the not too distant future. The inflationary subsidy is fairly massive atm, and transactions aren't growing at anything resembling a pace to make up for them dropping.


I don't have any incentive for you to succeed or fail. The hilarious corruption among hero worshipped early adopters is a much larger impediment to your success than I will ever be.

I've said it before, but this is one of the only use cases for bitcoin that actually makes sense. If the fallout from Silk Road had been marketing bitcoin as an alternative for legal high risk markets instead of an explosion of "new wealthy elite" toppling government fetish porn combined with trying to shoehorn it into markets where it doesn't make any sense at all for the average non-political consumer, it may eventually have developed into a useful alternative payment method for Joe Public.

I don't think I would, mainly because it would just be a downvote honeypot, and I'm not willing to reveal enough of my past history to make it very interesting, I'm afraid.
I just like weird internet subcultures, especially ones where there is a clash between starry eyed true believers and scammers. It has been a boring hobby of mine since the 90's. The paranormal scammers, dot bomb and penny stock scammers, MLM and social media marketing scammers, house flippers and the hilarious industry that grew to exploit them, goldbugs, etc...I've inserted myself into all of them at some point or another. 
This one presses almost all of my buttons. The hypocrisy between the freedom rhetoric and the intense desire to stamp out dissent is rather hilarious. As a software developer, the technology behind bitcoin is rather interesting, but the horrible community that almost immediately flocked to it has most likely doomed it.
Someone asked me to source a comment I made last night, and in the course of trying to dig it up I ended up spending a couple of hours browsing old mailing lists and forum posts from 2009 and early 2010. Some of the ideas that were being proposed before the greed brigade jumped in were incredibly forward thinking.
Unfortunately, we're left with this. Hucksters, shills, scammers, spammers, stalkers, and angry ideologues stamping their feet and yelling at anybody who dares question The Protocol.
I'll keep posting as long as it is entertaining, or something else comes along. Same as I've always done.

The actual date is less important that acknowledging that unless something substantial changes, it is only a matter of time. Selling people on something that you know isn't sustainable is disingenuous at best.


There is no indication that bitcoin should be compared to "wall street volumes." This is a more obfuscated version of the "if only 1% of the global economy moved to bitcoin............." argument.


Sure, it could! If you actually believed that "it could happen" is a valid argument, though, you wouldn't be arguing with my original comment.


I don't think that most of the people cheering on pmarca and crew realize what these guys expect from an investment. You can get a slight clue based solely on the fact that he is on the ebay board and dumping millions into coinbase. You need to look past the glowy bitcoin fantasy pump language spewing out of these guys and examine what they are actually trying to do, which is sell your bitcoin dreams to the highest corporate bidder.

Sorry for the delay.
The thing is, that hindsight doesn't really apply in this case. If you go back to the early 2009 mailing list posts, bot nets were predicted and almost encouraged, and the end result of a dwindling number of datacenter operators controlling the network (which is the only end result of increasing hashrate, and does not make anything more secure) was predicted.
So yes, my broader point is that this is all a giant waste of time, money, and effort, that only serves to enrich the shady mining hardware vendors, pool operators, and resellers, and actually makes the network less secure, while not providing any increase in functionality.
This sort of exponential growth in network infrastructure simply to maintain, possibly reduced, functionality, is unprecedented, and absolutely retarded on every possible level.
In my opinion, obviously.

@_date: 2014-05-17 06:22:52
just so I understand, if the volume does nothing, or if it does nothing except for occasional spikes of large holders dumping, it is a bullish sign. 
If the price lingers downward for months and the volume dries up to a drizzle where even stamp is blasting under 4000 a day, bullish. 
If the price goes up, going to assume bullish. 
If the volume spikes on buys, also will assume bullish. 
Do you see how dumb this is?

Good question. Two reasons.
1) There are a lot of interesting innovations possible with the technology behind bitcoin. The fact that a small group of people are camping on a large amount of bitcoins is a problem because of how rapidly the price inflated. There is now an economic incentive to depress alternate implementations, which would have been okay several years from now, but not while the tech is still in its infancy and fraught with problems that nobody has solved.
2) The hypocrisy in the arguments from these douchebags annoy the shit out of me.

I don't really troll on this subreddit. I tend to make people upset, but I don't think I have ever actually trolled here, and there are any number of threads where people get mad at something I said and other regular posters jump in to say they appreciate my posts. In fact, you did. haha.
Honestly, the only place I really troll in regards to bitcoin is twitter, and I hope that it is fairly obvious to even the most casual observer that it is a joke and that I'm not actually asking the Queen of England to cut off the undersea cable to foreign countries to stop people from making bad posts on the internet.
That being said, thanks for the response, and I hope you don't take it personally. Sadly, the bitcoin community has curated a culture of scams that runs deep enough that I think the first thing anybody should do when being asked to send bitcoins somewhere is to immediately clutch their wallet and run away until there is some sort of evidence that the person they are sending them to isn't going to grab it and run away for them. This unfortunately also applies in a slightly different way to a number of shark-like bitcoin superstars, so having a position of respect among the bitcoin community doesn't necessarily make things less precarious.
Anyway, take it easy.

This is sort of the problem. The block rewards and transaction fees that are meant to subsidize the miners are no longer enough to pay for the big dumb arms race. Apparently the solution is to run unprofitable hardware, and make up for it by selling people unprofitable mining contracts. This provides money for more unprofitable hardware, which drives up the hashrate, and consolidates the mining industry even further as independent miners find it impossible to justify the losses which are compounded by the scamlords selling the hardware to them as a way to fund their datacenters.


It doesn't matter who gets it, the situation is not going to suddenly improve.


Yes, it is a racket that feeds on itself and pushes further market consolidation. Again, if it isn't GHash, it is going to be someone else. This is the direction the industry is moving, and unless something fundamental changes it is going to get worse rather than better. 
It doesn't seem like the long term issue is very concerning to very many people, just the "omg, GHash!" short term problem.

I think a lot of the "known trolls" are people who got banned during the frenzied pumping days as the wheels came off. 
There are also a load of good posters who got harassed and run off by maniacs during the same time period, like sqig, who did nothing but post well reasoned arguments about economics, got branded a troll, had a lunatic decide he was part of a paid shill brigade out to discredit him, and just washed his hands of the entire asylum.

This is making a lot of assumptions. I mean, they probably wouldn't intentionally mine at a loss, but the mining hardware industry is so crooked that there are probably a lot of people running hardware that they already invested in which will never turn a profit, just hoping to reduce the damage.
Then you have companies like cex, that resell their mining capacity with horrible terms, pushing any loss off on someone else.

I'm sorry, but it simply is true, which is why high risk payment processors exist. If your business or industry has a high rate of chargeback fraud, you aren't staying with a normal payment processor. The threshold is fairly low. 
Edit: the rest of your post is also wrong. The cost of a bitcoin transaction is huge, it is just hidden by inflationary subsidies. This isn't a weird statement, core devs have acknowledged this fact and warned of massively increasing transaction fees as subsidies wane.

The community is pretty broken, going back to the very beginning. The early adopters were fairly aggressive with the cultish pumping, and the second wave were fairly aggressive with being starry eyed and taken advantage of. Neither trend shows any sign of changing.

"If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to peoples questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer. If over 10% of your submissions and conversation are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer."

The biggest problem with the campaign for "bits" is that it completely ignores the equally aggressive campaign for 'millibits' that now everyone seems to awkwardly pretend never happened, despite the fact that bitcoinity still shows millibits as the default unit after facing massive pressure from this subreddit.
The end result is a weird situation where a millibit is equal to 1000 bits instead of 1/1000 of a bit.

This is quite likely that case, and what I personally believe, with the usual bitcoin market caveat that someone might have taken the opportunity to dump while the dumping was good and start a panic.
I think you may have misinterpreted the point of my statement.


Deepbit is a funny example, because the same sort of handwringing and desperate shilling that everything was okay was going on then. Go back and read some of the old threads, it is deja vu. Bitcoin never changes.

I'd like to point out that you basically just described exactly what I was talking about.

@_date: 2014-05-06 00:48:42
The problem is that increasing hashpower increases security from a new entrant, but makes it much easier for existing entities to do pretty much whatever they want via collusion. The general argument is that they wouldn't do anything to hurt their investment in bitcoin, but that is an argument with a lot of gaping holes in it. 
Right now there are still pools composed of independent miners and groups, but with the hardware vendors and pool operators building up their own massive operations rather quickly, I don't know how long that can last.

It becomes worth a lot more if they can mine as many blocks as they want without competition. The bitcoin community quickly goes from outrage mode to no big deal mode because they also have loads of money on the line. 
All it takes is a few popular bitcoin celebrities from popular bitcoin companies to blast a few tweets about how it is actually no big deal, or hey, maybe even a good thing, and people will switch from being mad about a thing to being mad when people being a thing up.

I'm not saying that they came up with the word bit, I'm saying that the reason it suddenly took over was a branding campaign.
For instance, a week after the post you are referencing was when Bitcoinity finally caved to the constant drum beating to default to mbtc, which was all the rage at the time.
edit: You might also note that Fenton started blogging about millibit vs bit shortly after the BitPay announcement, which probably would have been weird if everyone had already been onboard with bits prior to that time. It was a response to the sudden flood of "gosh I'm just gonna get a few bits!" that rapidly replaced "mbtc! just a buck!" as the most annoying overuse of exclamation points in history.
The fact that nobody has any memory of this and it is now a taboo topic worthy of burying under downvotes is a great indicator of the account churn here. It wasn't a secret.

This is the most confusing conversation I've had today.
That thread is referring both to issues that have arisen based on the current situation, which I assume is what you meant by "status quo," as well as issues which arise from the solution, which is wallets not allowing you to spend unconfirmed change.

There are two issues here, and you just sort of swept them off as "theoretical."

I'm kind of torn on it. From a user perspective, I wish we could get accurate vote information. From a reddit admin perspective, I understand that doing that is just asking to get steamrolled by spammers/scammers/etc. They have a valid point, which was also the opinion of the Alien Blue dev, that showing vote counts which aren't accurate is confusing and leads to constant whining by people who don't understand that what they are being shown isn't actually real.
So I guess it really hinges on what their motives are, and whether there are actual shenanigans going on with the admins. The reddit vote system is really convoluted, and without knowing what they are actually showing us, it is impossible to tell.
I understand the paranoia about berating them for not being transparent and possibly even untruthful about what is going on. That is pretty much how I feel when I yell at starmaged. haha.
Making changes to a system as large as this that depends on user buy in and where small tweaks can lead to unexpected consequences is a difficult challenge. You see the same sort of thing going on with the bitcoin devs pontificating on fiddling with fees and block sizes. (look I'm on topic). People are fickle and if they make a change that everyone hates enough, a mass exodus is always possible. The fact that we're discussing this on reddit instead of Fark or Digg is evidence of that.
ps I like beer and would totally chill with several of the interesting people I've met here but the actual maniacs and angry stalkers I've collected make that a horrible idea.

It being bitcoin has nothing to do with it being free. It is free because it is operating inside the database of a single organization, and you are ignoring any fees required to move into or out of the system.
You can have 100 people send you money for free if you all have Bank of America accounts. You can have 100 people send you money for free if you all send $1 to your friend Carl who will then move marbles into different paper cups that represent your account balance in response to text messages.

Actual trolling comments tend to get buried fairly quickly here. The people who are complaining about trolls are members of two groups.
- people who either changed their reddit settings to show buried comments or manually clicked on the expander to view the objectionable material
- people who keep mashing downvote on things long after they are buried
The problem with the second item is that while it may satisfy their deranged lust to punish people they disagree with, once someone's account goes negative they no longer have any incentive to not just make a billion new accounts and actually troll the shit out of everyone. Both of these are among the many issues with reddit as a platform, and are side effects of trying to shoehorn a cat picture aggregator into a discussion platform.

You need to give people an actual reason to use bitcoins over the payment method they already use. There is a reason merchant adoption is outpacing consumer adoption.

This would matter more if anybody was actually spending bitcoins with these merchants in any large number. You can surmise from the statistics that we do have that it is not happening.

Always spew mindless quotes when trying to pump up bitcoin. This was the code of the brainless morons on @_date: 2014-02-04 17:01:26
You're obsessed with USD volume. If the number of transactions stay flat or drop, while USD value goes up, it implies that if anything, less people are spending bitcoins.
If the price went up, and the transaction numbers increased with it, you'd be able to extrapolate that more people are spending are spending bitcoins, even if the USD volume stayed flat, because maybe they are spending smaller amounts. 
The USD volume is basically irrelevant when you have people sitting on massive piles of coins that they got dirt cheap. It is also basically irrelevant in the face of flat (or dropping) transaction numbers. 
Hope this helps.

If you hand over your personal information to any third party, people can copy it and use or sell it.
It is a flaw with trusted third parties, a problem which bitcoin hasn't solved, despite its best efforts. You'll find that most of the money being invested into bitcoin is going to exactly these types of companies, and people using these services are completely vulnerable to it.

You name all of these things, and fail to name anything that Joe Consumer cares about. 
For an interesting time, look at how miserable the verified by visa campaign went. This is a brand that is already mass market, that bitcoin enthusiasts love to point out problems with, and whose effort to trade mild inconvenience for increased security ended up being consumer poison. 
There is no incentive for anyone to jump through bitcoin hoops unless the person has a financial or ideological investment in bitcoin. On the one side, you have the VC funded companies trying to mash bitcoin into the existing centralized model, and on the other side you have frothing early adopters and people who want to be early adopters spouting fringe disingenuous liberty rhetoric for personal enrichment. 
Neither of these groups has presented any reason for a normal person to throw money or effort into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:25:22


This doesn't make any sense, other than as trying to wave your hands and pretend that for some reason paying a markup on every bitcoin purchase is no big deal, while paying a markup for credit fees is bad.


Sure, but most places don't do this, and if they do, they are surely already offering a cash discount. Also, by doing this, they are giving up one of the only advantages they even have from accepting bitcoins.


If you are depending on the good will of the IRS overlooking this if you get audited, you're not very smart. If you are depending on the majority of people having kept track of all their bitcoin transactions using LIFO, you're also probably dreaming.


Well this surely helps anybody now, in the current day, where we are making these posts. "Someone will eventually do something about it!" is the bitcoin mantra. This is ignoring the fact that there is no way for this amazing program to detect the difference between you sending a payment and you moving money from one wallet to another.


Well, actually it does when coupled with the aggressive pushing to get merchants to accept bitcoin.


Sure, but available evidence points in correlation equaling causation in this specific case.

A company shitting out press releases that nobody cares about is not really media attention. For instance, we knew when Overstock hit 600k in sales because of the NY hearings. We could deduce many BitPay numbers based on dissecting their spin cycle blog posts.

I agree. That's why I said it isn't possible to draw any further conclusions, especially based on nothing but a percentage. Not enough data. 
Unfortunately with promotions like this you mostly end up reading between the lines of what people aren't saying (or what gets leaked) because very few companies want to make press releases talking about how much their sales have dropped off.  Adafruit is the only one I can think of. 
You can extrapolate some things, like Overstock, and last year BitPay before they mostly clammed up, but the degree of accuracy isn't great. 
Such is life.

The satoshi is the only unit the bitcoin network cares about. It is the atomic unit of the currency. Everything else is just a convenient way to refer to collections of satoshis that have no meaning in the protocol. When you hear someone talk about making bitcoins infinitely divisible by shifting the decimal place, what they are actually talking about is creating a whole shitload more satoshis and then sneakily changing the meaning of all the other terms.

You have to make assumptions because they very quickly stopped posting transaction stats as soon as it became clear that the run up to Black Friday wasn't continuing into December.

Biting the hand that feeds you. Well, the problem with that theory, aside from the aforementioned alt coin evidence that it isn't true, is that the bitcoin community has been crowing about all the VC and Wall Street money that has been summoned and invested. 
Then you have the individual miners who have spent thousands of dollars on gear that is hard enough to get an ROI on now, much less if one group decides to mine every block. 
They are all chasing a return on their sunk costs, and the line between the hand and the mouth is increasingly blurred.

So far so good, assuming bitcoin actually ever poses any threat to them, which seems unlikely at this juncture...


...and then you go off the deep end.


I can count the number of merchants that I have shopped at that give cash discounts on two fingers. One is a gas station, the other is a liquor store. While I guess it is possible that this will become more widespread, it does not seem likely, right now. I should also point out that both of them also give a discount on debit transactions, which basically invalidates your entire point.


There is a good reason, for consumers, governments, and businesses.


The current rate of US inflation is around 1.3%, which is fairly low. Is that low enough, or are you trying to scoot around supporting deflation?


Like cash, debit cards, credit cards. Bitcoin fails at "low inflation" by being wildly volatile, and fails at "ease of use" by being consumer antagonistic and a pain in the ass to use. In fact, your italicizing of "consumers" is hilarious, because almost all of the positive arguments about bitcoin for consumer use are aimed at saving the merchants a percentage on fees, while stripping almost all of the consumer benefits that exist in the current system.


No, that's why most people don't camp on huge piles of cash.


Bitcoin is legal. A small chunk of people hold it. A much smaller chunk of people spend it.

As someone who appears to be financially and/or ideologically invested in bitcoin, you would be surprised at how bitcoin appears to people who are not either of those things.

This is a large assumption.


This was apparently an incorrect assumption.


It definitely seems that way, but it isn't as if there weren't plenty of warning signs.


Miners aren't really comparable to Gox. The mining system is part of bitcoin. The entire block reward and transaction fees are set up to subsidize miners. Harnessing individual greed to power the ecosystem is a core part of what was supposed to make bitcoin function. It appears to have backfired, and there does not appear to be a lot of movement or confidence that a fix is going to be found.
There seems to be a disconnect where people are fine answering bitcoin criticism with "it is still in beta" or "it is an experiment" while not actually grasping what that actually means in terms of the money and hope they have sunk into it.

You can compare the actual block counts listed below the graph with the actual blocks and do your own math. 
They were at 50.2% on the rolling 24h earlier. This is after being at 40% most of the day. It is likely they have been well over 51% at many times. 
Sorry. Your post is lazy, wrong, and dumb.

Not really on the consumer side of things. It does attempt to solve a few problems with over engineered technology that have been solved more easily in a non-technical way.

The problem is that ease of use is never going to be easier than just spending money on a thing instead of spending money on bitcoins, then spending bitcoins on a thing, then having the merchant convert the bitcoins back into money so that they can spend money on a thing.

I think it is safe to say he is greedy. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:47:59
I would recommend investigating it. If a merchant is using a normal payment processor it is a good sign that their chargeback rate is very low. There are regularly abused industries, which is why porno sites tend to use last resort "high risk" processors. 
You're also ignoring the other consumer benefits, that are going to be nearly impossible to pry people away from for day to day use.

Yes, this is the answer that usually comes up, and it entirely glosses over the point.
The point being that scaling up a transaction processing network from the level of "some guy's CPU" to "surpassing all existing supercomputers put together" while not adding any transaction capacity, nor even experiencing enough demand to consider adding more transaction capacity...is mind bogglingly insane, and something that some rather notable people have been pointing out since literally the beginning of bitcoin.

It should be pointed out that they made almost the same amount of money from bitcoin enthusiasts in the last two weeks that they did on the first day.
I imagine that by this time next month, bitcoin sales figures will be increasingly hard to come by. Much like BitPay's elusive December numbers, which by connecting the dots of their press releases and public statements put them back under what their October numbers were.

I have a few other breakdowns of the merchant averages, but I'm on my phone and can't find the link easily atm. 
There still haven't been any December BitPay numbers, or even any merchant counts recently. I am looking forward to them to see which one of their other numbers was incorrect, because they currently don't really add up very well, especially if you include the statement in early January about running 5k transactions a day against the statements in the same article that make December seem closer to 500. Don't know. Very weird, but maybe someone just misspoke. 
Edit: a disclaimer, "as far as I know" they haven't released those numbers. If they have and I've missed them, would appreciate a link.

I'm really confused as to what the hell you quoted, so I'll assume you did it accidentally.
I'm also a bit confused as to what you mean by "previous payment gateway."
But for the basic math. ~$500k 2 week sales, minus ~$200k first day sales = $300k over 13 days, which works out to ~$23k/day.
$23k/$200k * 100 = ~11%.
I'm hopeful, but not confident, that this will point you in the right direction.

Hoo boy. The network effect, as it applies to bitcoin in the broader payment ecosystem is basically non-existent. The size of the community, when placed into the context of today's ASIC mining arms race with hashrate and hardware deployment built up to insanity levels and likely not supported by the current prices, is a liability rather than a "good thing." 


That is debatable, and ignores other things available to a party who controls the network. 


You need to think outside the box, buddy. If the price of bitcoin doesn't go up substantially before the next block halving, there is going to be an awful lot of mining hardware in the hands of an awful lot of suddenly massively underwater miners. Why buy the cow, when you can rent the milk for pennies on the dollar.
This is also ignoring the push for tying irl assets to blockchain tokens when calculating the effects a single double spend can have vs the cost of performing it. 
Better to just pretend that for some reason that the hashrate skyrocketing while the price does the opposite, and while hardware manufacturers get into the mining business, is just not a problem or whatever.

Okay, I think this is the disconnect. Why do you think the addition of ever more powerful and consolidated mining hardware equates to an increase in transaction processing capacity?
The increase in computing power is directed at the solving of ever more difficult proof of work puzzles, which have little bearing on how many transactions are able to be processed. 
Unless I'm misunderstanding what you are trying to say, in which case, please clarify.

I enjoy my posts. Some people enjoy some of my posts. 
When you have an unpopular opinion in a place where the mob has the ability to bury your words, being a polite wallflower is not an effective or fun way of being heard. I think your own experiences in that regard should be evidence enough.

It isn't, though. That's like saying because the credit card fees are hidden by the merchant, that credit cards have no costs associated with them. As much as people here hand wring over dastardly fiat inflation, there seems to be little care that the steady march of bitcoin printing and dilution of their holdings is what is being used to pay off the mining industry's ridiculous transaction costs. It isn't low cost at all, it is just well disguised.


Well again, in addition to making it pointless to use bitcoin for those transactions, they are actually detrimental to the idea that as block rewards dwindle that transaction fees are going to remain low and make up the difference in transaction volume.

The only reason bitcoin transactions are so cheap at the moment is because the massive cost is paid for via (and obfuscated by) rapidly inflating the coin supply via mining subsidies. 
There are currently around 400 transactions per block for which 25 bitcoins are created and paid to the miners. This is around $37 per transaction.

You say competition lowers price, but I think what you really mean is that piggybacking on existing infrastructure lowers price. 
Assuming your argument is true (for the sake of there even being an argument), and in the best case scenario where bitcoin actually poses some sort of threat to the existing providers...
The existing providers have already built their infrastructure, and will lower prices. 
Please note that this situation will never actually happen.


There is very little evidence that this is true, or even evidence that people actually want to use bitcoins as currency.


Okay, great. But there is very little reason for any consumer to prefer bitcoin over Visa or Mastercard unless it is to advance a political agenda or in the hopes of propping up an investment while the media is looking. This is borne out by what is actually happening.


Consumers prefer currency that inflates predictably at reasonable levels, rather than the insanity of a collapsing economy or the misery of a deflationary depression. Bitcoin is currently the worst of both worlds.

It is a fairly predictable pattern. If you are unlucky enough to have a comment that can be construed as negative when a post first starts moving to the front page, it is getting downvoted. 
If it stays in /new or you wait until after it's lingered on the front page for a while, it usually becomes safe to speak freely again. 
I think there are a lot of bitcoin superfans who only look at comments of new popular posts, and only do it once. The time of day tends to have a fairly predictable effect on how comments are voted, as well.

When you add spread, fees, and the fact that "bitcoin deals" are generally not ongoing forever, and that you are generally already paying the credit card markup, and that bitcoins aren't really accepted much of anywhere, you're wrong.


I'm sorry. This is a fairly common credit card feature. Perhaps shop around.


There is really nothing "above."

His prediction was always that it would hit 200 before it ever hits 1200 again.
You could ignore that as a "click error (lol)" but then you have to deal with Gox brushing the line.
Of course, you'll want to ignore that as a fluke because reasons, etc.
But even stamp doesn't look poised to rocket past 1200 again anytime soon, so I'm not sure why he'd be mad, other than the hilariously inappropriate ban.

The last time there was a backlash against zero day spammers, there was a brief lull and then a flood of spam from accounts that were just over a month old.
If you say "here is our criteria for spam!" you're just going to get spam from accounts that exactly meet that criteria. The only reason you are seeing spam from zero day zero karma accounts is because there is currently no incentive for spammers to try harder than that.

haha, no. I think a 90% drop across multiple vendors is sufficient to validate. It is actually even worse when you look at how few transactions even the big first day numbers actually encompassed. There is basically nobody spending bitcoins unless the media is looking and there is a chance to bring in "new money" to bump the price.
edit: and it is actually even worse than that when you look at the number of people in this one subreddit who claimed to have bought something for this very reason.

If you asked the chief security officer of a popular bitcoin company what you had if someone else knew your private key, what do you think that person would tell you that you had, and if you were a person who had your lawyer tell the press that you didn't want anything to do with bitcoins, would you be happy or unhappy if the previously mentioned thing is what you had?

The problem is that a lot of the things that get called trolling end up becoming conventional wisdom here. At the end of last year, saying the massive runup in price was a bubble was trolling. Now people casually talk about their excitement at waiting for the "next bubble."

@_date: 2014-01-12 05:10:56
I agree, in part. 
There are many communities in which this is true. Unfortunately, they tend to be communities where a combination of true belief, chosen one syndrome, a lust for wealth, and ideology leads to a massive exploitation by people who do not share the same dreamy outlook.  
In more normal situations, there is not a sense of shock from honest dealers that people trust them, because the same type of systematic exploitation is not considered "normal."

It isn't really skepticism. It is just simple arithmetic, and so far it applies to basically every available bitcoin number that has been released. Network transaction volume (down 41% since Black Friday), BitPay statistics (won't release December numbers, based on public statements appear to be back down to September volumes), Overstock numbers (down 90% avg since day 1), and now TigerDirect (down 90% avg since day 1).
I'm not sure how many data points we need before people stop getting mad when I say that almost nobody spends bitcoins unless there is media attention that may drive up the price of their bitcoins.
I understand why people want to bury it or ignore it, but that is a dangerous game, because it is going to very publicly bite you in the ass at some point.

The unfixable defect could be that nobody wants to spend bitcoins because it is the most consumer unfriendly payment system ever devised, and the true believers and early adopters that could boost the bitcoin economy are busy hodling to the moon.

Second try, my last reply got eaten by getting logged out.
I personally think the chart you posted is deceptive for the purposes of examining the bitcoin economy. The same reasons get given for using it, which is usually "why would you count exchanges moving their money around!"
But the reality is, it is mostly gambling, which is a huge part of the bitcoin economy. The fact that leaving the gambling in the chart presents a flat or declining trend, while removing it presents an upward trend, seems to imply that people are shifting from gambling to other transactions, rather than more people are buying things with bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-08 14:47:39

The online porno industry is one of the only business cases where bitcoin makes any sense at all, since their retarded chargeback rates force them onto last resort high risk processors.
But as usual, in the bitcoin world, there's a crucial flaw that ends up making it a shittier choice anyway. In this case, it is the fact that most online porn sites make their money on recurring subscriptions that people don't realize or forget to cancel.
Basically all of bitcoins features are just problems disguised as solutions.

Not really.


Except that the reason for the fees are the additional services, consumer protections, and convenience, which don't exist in the bitcoin ecosystem, and have mostly been removed by design.


There is obviously some effort, because nobody is spending bitcoins.


Your definition of "competing" is overly, and hilariously, broad. It is like saying a guy with a hamburger truck is competing with McDonald's, except his hamburgers are completely outside the scope of the USDA, and he makes them in a bathtub.

You'll notice that he gave it as either or statement. Either blocks need to be faster or blocks need to be bigger. The keyword is "or."
The ten minute blocktime is completely arbitrary, much like the initial coin distribution. Satoshi picked something he thought was good, and that's what we have now. Since we have no idea what his actual motives were, and he is no longer around to give his opinion, there is not really any reason to cling to it as some sort of holy truth from on high. People questioned some of his choices back in 2008, but it didn't make a lot of difference, because here we are.
The fact that people who are mad about a small group of bankers fiddling with monetary policy and financial incentives eagerly embrace exactly the same behavior from a random group of software developers is weird as heck, but again, here we are. It is amazing how greed can smooth over logical dilemmas.

BitPay (numbers from their recently restored blog, and press comment by CEO, linked in this thread): 
edit: in case you don't want to pull the numbers out on that yourself, CEO said in press release that nov/dec numbers were 2X sep/oct, which would make December numbers 15k, or on par with September. Note that they have thus far refused to release December numbers are still posting about November and Black Friday.
Overstock (130k first day, 500k two week, or 320k over 13 days, NY Hearings said 600k total, which means 100k next week): 
Math on that is 130k day one. 320k next 13 days, which is ~28k/day. 100k next seven days, which is ~14k/day)
TigerDirect: this thread. 250k first day. 500k first 10 days. (edit: thought this was the TigerDirect thread, sorry. They released those numbers today. See my comment history for the actual thread link).
edit: one last edit, sorry. The network numbers come from blockchain.info. The 41% drop from November shows up on both the total transactions graph, and the total transactions minus popular addresses graph.
Hope that helps.

The problem is that nobody is really even spending money with BitPay. 
In Febrary, they processed 2300 transactions for 3200 merchants (0.7 sales per merchant). 
In March, they processed 5100 transactions for 4500 merchants. (Just over one sale per merchant). 
April was about 1.2 sales per merchant. 
The press releases pick back up in August, where again, it was about 1.2 sales per merchant.
September it bumped up to about 1.5.
It ramped up during November for Black Friday, but strangely no December numbers have been released. Even at the peak of November, the sales were abysmal, and based on their blog entries, were mostly people buying gift cards, gold, and bitcoin mining gear.
You aren't just barking up the wrong tree, you're barking at a hole in the ground where no tree will ever grow.

reddit encourages using "np.reddit.com" links when linking to other threads/subreddits. It means "no participation" because you aren't supposed to follow links into other threads and then vote/comment brigade them. Using np links allows the owner of the subreddit to change the styles to add warnings or remove voting arrows, etc. 
Even if they don't do that, or even following non-np links into other threads and then participating, can (and likely will, eventually) result in getting shadowbanned from reddit.

That's fine, and I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't think that was fine.


I don't really care about bitcoin. I have done a fairly noble job of chasing off obvious scammers and spam. I have done an excellent job, that very few regular posters here do, of curating /new. I have done piles of extracting actual numbers from the dumb PR bullshit that bitcoin companies put out that nobody else here, or anywhere else on the internet as far as I know, has done, despite taking shit for it. 
It is unfortunate that my posting doesn't live up to your expectations, but I really don't care, and I don't mean that as a personal slight.


This is a terrible opinion when people are getting systematically taken advantage of. Gosh, I'm really happy that pirateat40 is giving me such a great investment return! And just to be clear, the person who moderates this forum and bitcointalk.org happily let people be happy investing in that dumb fuck's scam, and even chipped in himself.

This isn't necessarily true, though. There are pyramid schemes that center on products. The intended use of the products isn't what is generating the money, though, and they are usually worthless for their advertised use. In these types of situations, there may be bottom rung suckers that are actually trying to use the products, or trying sell them to other people for their intended use.
This is much like bitcoin. Bitcoins are hyped as the currency of the internet, a task at which is is ill designed for, and which almost nobody wants to use it for. Its use as a currency isn't why it is worth money, and its value is based almost entirely on convincing new people to buy in.
 &gt;What Bitcoin is (arguably) subject to at present is a pump-and-dump scam. Current holders encourage others to buy in with the incentive of large profits and using false positive statements, or omitting negative statements (greed is a common motivator used by scam artists) knowing that due to supply and demand the purchase of Bitcoin by others will lead to the value of their holding going up, while not actually disclosing this fact. Once it is at a high enough value, the Bitcoin can be dumped for profit, and the later buyers are screwed. There is some overlap here with a pyramid scheme, but by and large it is not one - a pyramid scheme is created with the intention of fraud, a pump and dump security is often a legitimate penny stock that others have latched onto.
It does have a lot in common with penny stock pump and dumps superficially, but this hinges on their being some sort of planned dump by a small group of operators, which doesn't seem to be the case for the most part, unless they are moronically patient.
I'm really curious to see what happens if/when Wall Street money moves in, because whether it is a pyramid scheme or a pump and dump, it is really going to throw a wrench in whatever the plan was.

It hasn't stayed "relatively stable and high."
It slowly dragged down since the beginning of January, punctuated by brief pumps of huge buy orders, after which it immediately went back to dragging down on anemic volume. The last pump finally got traction, and then, yep, back to fizzling.

lol no. I heard about bitcoins on slashdot years ago and never really thought about it again. I sort of just bounced around random subreddits when I was bored. My old main account got banned from for making fun of their trip reports, so I made this one, which is where the name came from. 
After I got banned again, I went back to /all/new and stumbled across a bitcoinmarkets post and got sucked into the vortex. 
I really don't care about bitcoins at all which makes it even funnier that I've been turned into some sort of bitcoin bogeyman. I just like posting here because of the collection of people and weirdness always going on. 
To answer I've never owned a bitcoin. I don't even collect tips.

That's odd. I'll be honest, this makes my spidey sense tingle. Here's the chart they posted on their blog.
Do the math and then we will continue chatting.
edit: and I've also mentioned previously that I'm interested in their Q1 2014 numbers, because clearly Nov/Dec are holiday months and for retail are generally skewed. 
edit edit: view the november numbers in light of the fact that 6200 transactions took place on the heavily promoted black friday event.
edit edit edit: 5000/day would be a 150,000 month, or over double what their november numbers were. seems a little odd based on how they phrased the statement you posted, which would imply much less.
edit sorry for all the edits: twice their september and october volume based on that chart is only ~1166 transactions a day. this is strange, and the most interesting conversation i've had on in a while.

That didn't work either so now you are starting to see a bunch of totally honest accounts advocating shifting it even more because decimals are confusing.

Out of the last 2300 changetip transactions on reddit, only about 90 have been collected by anybody outside of a cryptocurrency enthusiast subreddit or thread.

Hi, here's a thing I never even said.


it is funny because I specifically mentioned that they weren't charging a fee right now.


Yes, this is true. They could use any method of settling accounts, because, and pay attention because this was the actual argument I was making, changetip has basically nothing to do with bitcoin.

You can't extrapolate like that when the rate of decline isn't known. Best case scenario is a 90% drop in volume, assuming every day after the first had the same sales numbers, which is unlikely.

The biggest argument against bitcoin is examining the posts here about how the banks, government, and visa are totally terrified of bitcoin, and then examining the actual numbers regarding bitcoin. Like how on the biggest shopping day of the year, there were only 1.5 transactions per second, a number which has fallen by half as we move out of the holiday season. Or Overstocks rapidly falling bitcoin sales numbers. Or BitPay's continued insistence that last month was November.
The number of bitcoin transactions per day is hovering around 60k, which is almost identical to what it was a year ago, despite all the hype about adoption.
(This is completely ignoring the terrible technical and economic problems with bitcoin).

Most people only spend bitcoins when there is a chance the media will notice and pump up the value of their coins. 
Eventually this is going to backfire hilariously.

This argument is dumb, because it only makes sense if actual money vanishes. Since that is not going to happen, people are going to keep buying things with money and hoarding bitcoins unless there is a chance that spending them will garner media attention and new users, which will drive up the price.
The numbers back this up.

@_date: 2014-07-02 03:13:38
I documented this in the period following their acceptance of bitcoin based on public statements and numbers, but there isn't a great way to dig up old buried reddit comments. 
At one point bitcoin was 1% of their sales, and in Byrnes's AMA the other day he admitted they were less than 0.1% of sales now, which is what my initial calculations that got shit on came out to, to the percentage. 
You can run it yourself by looking at their day one sales and subsequent announcements, and then adding in them saying they were at 600k on day one of the first NY hearings, and then when they hit $1 mil. It was a fairly steady drop. 
There is a lot of interesting info you can extract by pulling actual numbers from bitcoin press releases and doing some basic math. Bitpay is another weird one.

Why do you think this? We've had deflation, and it was not a good thing. The current monetary system is largely a result of trying to prevent it from happening again.


Maybe. But will they spend it? All signs point to "no."


It isn't as easy to use as the dollar, which sort of invalidates the rest of your argument.


And your evidence of this is...


Unsupported speculation built on unsupported speculation.


Oh boy. Yes, it is wise to slowly migrate your retirement accounts to less volatile investments as you get closer to retirement. This is because you are going to need to cash them out and rely on them to live on, rather than trying to maximize returns at a higher level of risk.


Again, unsupported speculation, based on literally no evidence.

This is still up for debate, and like much of bitcoin, hinges on the argument of "someone will fix it, eventually!"

Honestly in terms of the bitcoin network, a thousand college kids with GPUs is a better solution than three massive data centers with business plans.


This sounds good, but because there is basically no regulation or accountability in bitcoin world, you end up with companies like cex that remain profitable by funding their expansion by reselling unprofitable and unregulated mining securities, or companies like the mining hardware vendors who remain profitable by gobbling up pre-orders and refusing to ship until the hardware is basically worthless.
In many ways, the network was better off when every random person with a spare room and a rack of GPUs or FPGA's in front of an open window could compete.

I'm a realist, and I've had a lot of experience with these sorts of communities and schemes. Despite the intentionally inflammatory language, the "21st century Ponzi scheme" article that was posted earlier is a fairly accurate depiction of the bitcoin community.
I prefer the sharks and true believers terminology over "wolves" but it is essentially the same thing. The ideology is an easy trap to snare new money. Go look at penny stock forums, or goldbug forums, or prepper forums, or just leaf through the ads in any ideologically targeted magazine or newsletter.
The only ideology the people at the top have is "how can I take more money." Wrapping it in fringe economic or political beliefs that most rational people don't cling to is just an easy way to isolate an easy source of funds.

Part of the problem with reddit is that the search is garbage, very few people browse /new, the people that do end up voting on the billion reposts first, and that users are rewarded for coming up with new titles and sources for reposts.

I think it is important to remember that this was discussing the benefits that credit cards provided over the current systems in place at the time. Modern credit cards and payment systems have obviously expanded their roles.


I'm not sure this is a huge selling point.


Great, so use cash.


You are carefully leaving a lot of things out here. Many credit cards actually extend the warranties on your products, you are assuming that consumer protection laws mean that no merchants are shady and that someone would rather take a fly by night operation to court rather than just call the bank, and that someone is going to be willing to take an even larger hit on spread, fees, volatility risk, and all the other assorted risks from bitcoin, while gaining absolutely no benefit over just swiping their card. (other than the risk that someone steals their credit card number, I guess, which is already covered by the issuer).


Do you have a source for this.


But there are consumer protection laws, you just told me. That should enough, you said.


Why would you buy a car with a credit card. I'm genuinely curious.


Yes, it is possible to come up with fringe cases and anecdotes where using bitcoin would have been better for the generic consumer. This is not a great selling point for convincing the general public to adopt bitcoin, you do realize.


I don't have a problem with this, but it has little bearing on my original point, which is that despite all the push from bitcoin holders and payment processors to drag merchants into the bitcoin game, there has been basically no effort put into giving Joe Consumer any reason to go through the hassle and expense of using bitcoins instead of existing payment methods.

lol, let's do the math. this is the biggest shopping month of the year. 
55,288 transactions / 30 days = ~1843 transations a day (we will ignore the fact that Black Friday had over three times the normal volume).
1843 / 24 hours in a day = ~77 transactions an hour
= 1.2 transactions a minute
= 0.02 transactions a second.
Just to put that in perspective, PayPal averages 8 million transactions a day, which is more than ten times the number of transactions per second than the bitcoin network can actually handle.
haha, i love press releases.

As a software developer, there is a particular type of programmer who is known as an "over engineer." He is the bane of every project. The solution to every problem does not necessarily have to be the most elegant technologically perfect masterpiece, and may not be solved with technology at all.

I agree that it was carefully sold to them that way. I disagree that purported ideological purity of payment systems has much of anything to do with why people choose a method of payment.

You'll notice that nearly all the efforts to promote bitcoin focus on merchant acceptance. Then you can look at say, bitpay stats from last year before they shamefully stopped releasing them, and see that they averaged something like &amp;lt;2 bitcoin transactions per merchant per month. 
The reason for both of these things is that bitcoin as a payment system is consumer antagonistic by design. Its usefulness is a speculative investment and it is only useful in that regard if it can be hyped to attract new investors. This is why overstock bitcoin sales dropped 90% when it stopped being newsworthy. 
Hope that helps.

You'll notice that mining is becoming increasingly centralized into companies that have found ways to shift the profit via means not available to individuals. Either by building their own hardware and mining on it (often funded by preorders) and in some cases then selling it when the profits dry up, by selling unprofitable mining contracts or shady "shares" or "coins" and thus shifting the unproitability to consumers, and various other schemes. 
Meanwhile you have people who have received the belated and often pre-used hardware mentioned above and are running it chasing break even that may never come.

The majority owner of blockchain is currently on an island desperately trying to renounce his citizenship and thinking that "federal agents could swoop in and smother his future with conspiracy charges." He also shamefully endorsed Mt. Gox in the famous hostage video, and is prone to begging people on reddit to spam his vendors for not taking his bitcoins seriously.

The problem is that third parties remove most all of the reasons to use bitcoin in the first place, and the decentralized argument is sort of shat on by the fact that 70% of the mining is done by four pools. 80% by six pools.

This doesn't make any sense as an answer to the alternative. Which is not risking anything by using a more convenient normal payment method.


Yes, I completely agree.


Still in agreement, though I'm not sure what this has to do with anything.


"It sucks now, but someone will probably fix it!" --so many posters here


And one of the main reasons to choose bitcoin over the existing system, which works fine.


So the core of it the trustless decentralized system, is trusting that people will play by the rules. That seems a little weird, honestly.

Based on the number of "I went to this restaurant I found on coinmap and they stopped taking bitcoins!" posts that have popped up over the months, I would say, "no."
Even the larger merchants generate any number of posts about weirdness involving refunds, etc, based on the company having to maintain and train people on two separate systems for something that generates less than half a percent of their revenue. This is not taking into account the specifics of the deals they are receiving from the VC fat processors hungry for publicity.

Been saying this on twitter.
The problem is that the real impetus for all this is promoting bitcoins. Get angry at a reporter, press reports on it. Donate money to Satoshi, press reports on it.
Whether it is Satoshi or not, one thing he would probably like is for the press to stop reporting on him. Unfortunately, the people driving both the outrage campaign and the philanthropy campaign aren't really worried about that, because there are bitcoins to promote.
That's not to say that there aren't bitcoin enthusiasts who were genuinely upset about the news, or genuinely want to give money to Satoshi, but this has been a top down effort.

There was a great post a while back from someone who actually does vote rigging that explained quite a bit about how things tend to work, but in reality there aren't a lot of people who read /new, so a small group of angry people and zealots run the show. This applies to most of reddit.

If you crunch all the released numbers since day one, and watch the steady drop into oblivion now that it isn't a media event, yes.

TigerDirect showed a similar pattern but they've put out less numbers so it is hard to make a trend.

That's really what I was referring to. The 70k number. Sep/Oct are around 35k. November is around 55k. To reach a 2X, December would have to be 15k. Right? That would be September numbers, which seem honestly too low for even my hilarious predictions, in terms of the christmas season.
Regardless, 5,000/day seems like either bullshit, or picking a day that was randomly successful. I don't know. It just doesn't add up in any reasonable way.
I hadn't heard the 5,000 number until your post, so I'm just wondering if there was actually some catalyst or if these are just bullshit numbers in general.
Right now, there only seems to be three possibilities...bullshit numbers, cherry picked numbers, or somehow a nearly 5X daily increase that for whatever reason they are publicizing as only a 2X increase?
Seems weird, but maybe i'm missing something. If my calculations are off, feel free to correct me.
Edit: regardless, thanks for humoring my inquiries. There is interesting conversation to be had when critical thought is applied to facts and figures. I look forward to seeing the Q1 numbers. It's hard to draw any solid conclusions before that.

They hit 51% the day before the price drop, when they hit it again.
January was a weird time, and was the start of an unrelated slow slog down from the the top. I think it is worth noting that even after the dump around the time of the second 51%, the price stayed higher than it was only a couple of weeks prior, when one of the regular whale pump attempts that have been going on since the bottom fell out finally succeeded with a few massive buys.

BitPay carefully words their press releases. If you look at the available actual numbers we have from them, which run through the end of Q1 this year, you would find that it appears their avg transactions per month remained &lt; 3 and basically stagnant.
When you then consider that there is no way the tx/month is distributed equally due to the presence of several much larger merchants, you have to wonder how many of their merchants are even seeing one transaction a month, which makes what "50% of their merchants" do basically meaningless because for all we know 50% of their volume might come from 5 merchants that all convert to cash.

You're right. Bitcoin uses a carefully constructed expansion of the money supply to hide the actual cost of the network from users while enriching the early players with the hope that by the time anybody notices that they will be heavily invested enough to ignore it once the costs shift back to the later users.

This is important to basically nobody in the bitcoin community other than as a talking point. "use coinbase! use bitpay! third parties will appear to do escrow! third parties will alleviate transaction limits! third parties will ..."

Honestly, based on the previously released numbers, this seems extremely unlikely unless they are planning on rapidly expanding to other countries, which is a possibility.


The new customers line was really what I was looking for. The higher order amount isn't really worth much, both because there are so few customers and because with what they've released it is impossible to tell if it is just a couple of large holders blasting out huge orders and a trickle of small orders.

This seems to be a fairly recent phenomenon. During the earlier phases of the last four months of decline, there was mostly insistence that this wasn't a bubble. 
Once it became clear that it was popping, the narrative changed to the current "of course it is a bubble, there are lots of bubbles, see how the charts line up, when will the next bubble come because that's what we all love!"
The difference is that one says bitcoin is cratering and one says bitcoin is moonward bound.

Local businesses on coinmap, like the restaurant that took bitcoins for a week and then stopped as soon as the press coverage ended.
The bitcoin protocol, and it's "feeless" transactions, that won't actually process in any reasonable amount of time without fees, and that require eating the exchange spread, and usually also eating the retail credit card markup. Wow!


These things are actually pretty cool.


It is a technical solution to a game theory problem shoehorned into being a payment system with problems that have already been solved in a less technical way. The interesting early use cases for it have been obliterated by speculators and the community that sprung up around it. Bitcoin is fucked.

Well, they will continue at their current rate for another year or so, at which point they will be whacked in half. If you examine the current deficit between mining rewards and transaction fees, and then realize that the cost of mining is essentially equivalent to the payout, and then maybe look at what has happened to alt coins during halvings, perhaps you will see the problem.


The ongoing costs of maintaining a secondary payment system that generates basically  no income, for one. The fact that it is excessively consumer antagonistic by design, as another.

I'm not sure what proof you want. This isn't some sort of secret.
KNC has jumped up to 6% of the network this year. CEX is somewhere between 25% and 40% of GHash. The PETA threads were spamming this place up for days. The block subsidies aren't paying the bills, any hope of transaction fees making up for that are so far in the future as to be irrelevant, so costs have to either be reduced, offloaded to someone else, or some combination thereof.
edit: I don't care if you are "scared." Trying to pretend like facts are scaremongering is dumb, though.

The thing is that merchants will never see this. They will see it as a debit card transaction, because that is essentially what it is. You give your bitcoins to some company, they convert them to cash and load a debit card. You pay a fee to them, the merchant pays normal processing fees. The only time bitcoin ever comes into the picture is when you send it off to the card company.
From a consumer perspective, this gives them none of the purported benefits of bitcoin, and adds several layers of hassle.
From a merchant perspective, this gives them none of the purported benefits of bitcoin, and they probably have no idea bitcoins were ever involved in the first place.

Yes, but it involves going back through a lot of old bookmarks and posts and I'm kind of back and forth between my computers and phones atm, but off the top of my head and hopefully not misremembering too much...
His early ideas for bitcoin don't really match where it got steered at all under his direction, his replies to criticism were sort of odd and seem heavily tailored to the audience, and his statement about initial coin distribution seemed rather hand wavy. 
Some of his predictions are a bit weird considering when they were made and what was being kicked around at the time, how many coins he ended up with that people know about, and when he vanished. 
For instance, the first "actually a good thing!" type post that I've seen was Satoshi in reference to bitcoin mining bot nets.
Or the question of why he set the difficulty low to encourage people to hop on and kick start the initial coin distribution and then started mining on what appears to be a large number of machines. 
Who knows. It is all speculation. I'm just not sure based on the circumstances why the motivations aren't question more for someone who owns such a gigantic percentage of all the coins on earth, acquired using rules he created, who then went poof and vanished without a trace.

Jesus christ, this is the article I was talking about when I mentioned extracting numbers from press releases.
"Most significantly, a rep also told me that the company estimates that Bitcoin buyers have made some $500,000 in purchases since Jan. 9."
Almost $200k of those purchases were on day one, leaving $300k over the next 13 days. 
If you want to make my point for me, maybe don't be so belligerent about it. Or maybe learn 2 math.
Either way.
edit: in case you are literally too dumb to do math, $300k/13 is about $23k a day, or almost a 90% drop in sales as the media stopped caring about Overstock accepting bitcoins.

You fall under the umbrella of "already ideologically or financially invested." In fact, you fall under both of them. Please refer to Ron Paul's presidential campaigns for how much of a shit everyone else gives about these things.
That being said, your supply concerns are pretty funny, considering that Gox lost almost 1/12 of all bitcoins on earth, and Satoshi is camping on another 1/12, and another huge part are just sitting idle with no idea whether or not someone still controls them.
The prospect of multiple anonymous people being able to flood the market with that many bitcoins should be entirely more terrifying to you than a group of bankers who are actually maintaining a fairly constant level of monetary inflation.
But, whatever. Bitcoin!

I honestly don't care if bitcoin succeeds or fails. I have no financial or ideological investment in a particular outcome.

I've met a lot of cool bitcoin people from all facets of the community. Critics, comedians, scholars, early adopters, hapless starry eyed rubes, lunatics, trolls, luminaries. 
I like weird communities and hate scammers, and the intersection of many weird communities and all manner of scammers is right here.

I'm not sure if you are being serious, but providing a single source system of credit that worked across multiple retailers...


They are "risk-free" for the merchant. They are full of risk for the consumer, lack any of the standard consumer protection offerings of credit cards, and being "final," like many features of bitcoin, is consumer antagonistic.
There is a huge push to get merchants signed up, but there has been basically zero push to come up with any sort of benefit for a consumer to convince them to jump through the hoops of acquiring and using bitcoins rather than existing payment methods. The one exception being illicit or embarrassing purchases.
Until someone cracks that nut, the only consumers it will appeal to will continue being mainly people who are already financially or ideologically invested in bitcoin.

Yes, that's why the force of the law is en-forced by the police force.
To use an example that you can better identify with, it is like when your mom tells you to clean your room and you don't do it, and then she hides the keys to your dad's car so you can't go the the sock hop with your friends.
Sure, you could sneak out and go, and maybe you won't get caught, but most people would just clean their room because President Mom's request for you to practice basic personal hygiene (even though you don't want to) is a reasonable concession for maintaining a peaceful basement.

@_date: 2014-12-26 06:47:33


Well, this isn't true.
I don't know what to tell you. BitPay has studiously avoided bragging about their transaction volume for Black Friday, as has everyone else involved. Overstock had a 90% drop off in sales over the year and is now only seeing $7000/week from US customers and 3-4 sales a week internationally. "The company said international customers now spend "a couple thousand dollars a week", though it expected figures to be closer to the $7,000–$8,000 a week it sees from US shoppers."
Adoption is stagnating. USD transaction volume is stagnating. Changetip, despite hilarious efforts to make it seem like it is going viral, has a pittance, and most of the tipping volume is from investor and employee activity. I'm curious what metrics you are looking at that show some sort of increase in consumer buy in.

It is cost effective if you can, say, take a bunch of money upfront for hardware, and then say, mine with it for a while to test it out. Or maybe if you can take a bunch of money for preorders, and then, say, build a giant datacenter that lets you rent the hardware you built with money from preorders.

There's not a lot of options for dissent here.
You can either do what sqig did, and make informative comments, get downvoted, buried, called a troll, and stalked by maniacs, until you get mad and are a dick, at which point it is proof that you are a troll.
You can do what witcoins does, and just make fun of people, get downvoted, buried, and called a troll.
Or you can do what I do, which is not give a fuck, get stalked by maniacs, and just post whatever because I have fun posting and it is the internet so who cares, really.
Lately I've been tweetering tweets, where luminaries such as Marc Andreeson, Andreas, and noted reddit poster and investment advisor Bruce Fenton favorite my tweets, and nerds get mad and write angry messages at me, because of my skillful tweetering and posting of said tweets.

You misunderstood my comment. 
There is a psychological barrier. If an exchange lists a price of $1, new people are more willing to feel okay bidding it up to $3. This is the point of the push, because that $2 jumps bumps up existing bitcoin values $2000, which is unlikely to happen without a way to get new money to bid up the price by several times. 
It is transparent as fuck, and starts getting pumped up every time the market stalls out, like clockwork.

I don't know how to break this to you, because I know there is a common perception in this big dumb subreddit that they only way someone can't be jackin' to bitcoin is if they don't understand it or haven't bothered to learn about it, but in my case that isn't true. I've read pretty much every word Satoshi uttered in a public forum, read all the old mailing lists, keep fairly up to date on the latest goings on, ideas, and innovations.

Unfortunately, making money from bitcoin is essentially dependent on getting rich off of other people.


They are depending on people like you.


I've been following weird communities like this for almost 20 years. I can say with authority that the bitcoin community, especially at the higher levels, is more full of shit than anything I've seen before.

This is where I disagree with you. Gambling is/was a gigantic part of the bitcoin economy, which appears to be decreasing. I think leaving it out is a bit weird, and is usually done to avoid the fact that bitcoin expenditures are just shifting around rather than rapidly increasing in any way. Generally when this comes up people try to play it off as exchanges moving their money around, but it really doesn't appear to be the case.


I don't have a horse in this race, and don't really care if bitcoin gets adopted or not. I just get annoyed at the constant manipulation of facts and numbers by people who swear to be acolytes at the alter of math. This applies to both enthusiasts and the companies spinning their terrible numbers in press releases.


This is pretty interesting, thanks for posting it. I don't think I've seen it before.


Unfortunately, he also points out why this number is completely misleading to use for comparing bitcoin to USD.
It's FLAT! Just like you argue above with number of transactions (yes, all of them!), he says the fact that it's flat is bad ("proves bitcoin is a bubble", as the title says). My reaction is entirely different: the fact that as bitcoin has surged 1000% to 5000% per year over the course of 3.5 years that velocity of money has remained flat is unbelievably encouraging. It means bitcoin values seem to be grounded in some sort of reality as bitcoin derives its value from its transferability.
Uhhhh. Bitcoin has seen a major price increase, a major buildout in infrastructure, and is still chugging along at around 1 transaction every 2 seconds, just like it was a year ago. There is no grounding at all in bitcoin other than greater fool speculation. There is merchant adoption with no consumer adoption, which isn't sustainable for companies that don't have an ideological or financial interest in pumping up the price of bitcoin (which even markets posters will admit is entirely contingent on luring new people into the exchanges).
I don't know. I'm fine if you disagree with me. Like I said, I have no stake in bitcoin other than I find the community interesting, and enjoy numbers, and posting.
I disagree with your conclusions, obviously.

If you look at the markets subreddit it has been taken over by numerologists and a cargo cult trying to summon a new bubble.

For an unsecured loan of that size, assuming you can find anyone who will loan money to blow on a speculative high risk investment, they are not going to go "gosh, he has worked for at least one month!" 
In reality, nobody is going to loan you $80k to buy bitcoins, and nobody is going to give you an unsecured $80k loan after being out of work all year. 
This is the dumbest post.

There is only an incentive for miners to do something if it becomes clear that people will abandon the system instead of just rolling over and rationalizing why it isn't a problem while carrying on buying their bitcoins.

Wow, what a surprise. Excluding popular.
Okay, here's a fun game. Leave your excluding popular graph open. Now open the list of what's excluded. Now open the full transaction chart. Ready?
See how the full transaction chart is basically a flat line that hasn't really budged in a year? Now fill in the gaps in the chart you posted with what's excluded. (Hint: it is almost all gambling). 
What conclusion can we draw from this? Oh, right. The increase in merchant adoption has just given the same people that were spending coins on gambling a different outlet to spend coins. The decrease in gambling traffic lines up perfectly with the increase in non-gambling traffic, leaving a flat line of no real transaction growth in 12 months. 
You're welcome.

Have you actually looked at BitPay's numbers, because they are really really awful. That is why most of their press release material focuses on percentages rather than actual transaction numbers. Their biggest sales day ever only ran 6,000 transactions. Prior to the holiday shopping season they were doing less than 700 transactions a day.
The available figures support the notion that nobody spends bitcoins, especially if the media isn't watching.

I would say that you should be less terrified of me than the existing mods, being that I've stood up for people that hate me rather than banishing their comments to the memory hole, and I'm not banning people with one account and trolling them with another, but the sad fact is that because of the existing mod hierarchy and the way that reddit works, a new mod will be indistinguishable from the old unless they are actually more iron fisted or actually make an effort to be both vocal and transparent.

I don't know why people have so much trouble with this.
If you report off topic posts, they are usually deleted almost immediately. The key thing is that you have to report them before they accumulate a lot of votes or comments.
The reason why so much of this garbage ends up on the front page, is because none of the people who complain about it actually bother to read /new or report anything.
It really isn't difficult.

Because the only way to keep the price going up is to convince ever greater numbers of new people to buy in below them. This is the driving motivation for basically everything a bitcoin enthusiast does, such as generally only spending bitcoins if there is a chance the media will notice.

For the majority of last year BitPay's monthly transactions per merchant average was &lt; 2. 
Overstock, a large company averaged ~$14k in bitcoin sales a day in their last reported numbers, which is down 90% off day one. 
TigerDirect has seen a similar drop based on reported numbers. 
So to answer your question, basically nobody spends bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 05:47:50
there is a common misconception that the only reason people aren't ecstatic about bitcoin is because they just don't get it, and if only they understood how glorious and beautiful and perfect the protocol was, they too would become true believers.
the problem is, that it is a misconception, and the mindset of "we must dispel all illusions and indoctrinate the masses to the glory of the coin!" is fucking weird to people who haven't already drained the kool-aid man of his delicious essence.
when someone comes and preaches to you about anything, whether a religion, or a technology, or an investment idea...people generally recoil. sure, you'll grab a few, which is why so many fringe religions still go door to door, and why spam is such a popular thing despite being reviled by any rational human being.

Roughly an additional 300k over 13 days. Best case scenario is around 23k/day or an almost 90% drop off. More likely it was a taper which would make the more recent daily numbers much lower.

I've made a number of posts about BitPay statistics, including how the numbers they've made available on their blog are impossible to rectify with other statements they've made, as well as how until October, their average monthly transaction per merchant was 1.5 or less.

I was following your comment up until this point. It may seem like this if you're only looking at the raw numbers instead of also pulling up the internet discussions and the hilariously low number of transactions that these TigerDirect and Overstock dollar amounts were from.
There is no "pent up demand." There is basically no demand at all, other than "I bet this will drive up the price of the bitcoins I am sitting on!"
I mean, that's fine, and understandable, but there is a weird avoidance of admitting that and a huge effort to spin the story to "bitcoin going mainstream."
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:16:45


I've got an idea. Even if you're making your own chips, the ever increasing difficulty and overhead required for power and data center space really eat into the potential profits to be had from selling all these bitcoins.
If there was a way to loan your mining company $116 million dollars of other people's money via your other company and then use that money to come up with a baffling word salad of justifications and hare brained schemes to convince other people to pay for the bulk of your mining expenses...
So crazy, it just might work...

I have been a software developer for &gt;15 years (wow I'm old) and I think the bitcoin technology is actually fairly interesting, and I don't think it is going to go away. There are a ton of interesting possibilities for it, and thankfully it is all open source, so some of them have a chance at actually being explored. 
That being said, I think bitcoin is doomed, and if it isn't, it should be. The early bitcoin community poisoned the well, in my opinion, and by some accounts is why Satoshi ended up bailing. It is possible that it will self correct, because the second phase of the Linux community had a lot of the same issues, and produced a lot of the same types of people. I think the fundamental difference, though, is that the early free software gang didn't have a gigantic vested financial interest in crushing dissent or criticism. The seething hatred you see here for altcoins, is a good indicator of this. 
I will have to look further into colored coins. I have not dug into that at all.

Because it functions like a pyramid scheme wherein the profits of early adopters depend on the continual flow of new money into the system rather than on any fundamental value of the "product." The product is irrelevant, which is why there are so many alt coins now. Bitcoin is a terrible solution to be used for its stated purpose. 
This is the reason behind the constant weekend drooling over new money every weekend, the slavish cult like misleading promotion, the intentionally false reframing of bitcoin news, the push to move to mbtc, and basically every other shady bitcoin event.

I think a key point to add to your thinking is that satoshi stated that he set the difficulty very low to encourage initial coin distribution and then immediately mined basically one out of every 20 coins that will ever be produced during the initial "distribution" and never distributed them to anyone.

Satoshi, in this case, is essentially the grinch. He touted setting the difficulty low to encourage initial distribution, and then started mining on what appears to be a lab full of computers, and didn't distribute any of them.

The negative impacts of salt appear to be more of an issue with the ratio between sodium and potassium intake. Removing salt from your diet will result in serious health problems. Your analogy is really terrible, in basically every way other than "sounding good to bitcoin enthusiasts who don't feel like actually thinking about things and need a meaningless ill-thought out soundbite from a questionable source that they can feel smug about." In that measure, I suppose it was a great success.
So sure, regulation is a lot like salt. Some of it is definitely necessary, but the optimal amount depends on other factors and requires further study and experimentation.

I don't know if they are necessarily more important because of that, but it definitely makes them different. It is hard to say much more than that without more information. 
For instance, if you were to look at stamp volume over the year, you would see that it has never achieved the levels it did during the peak of the bubble. If you look at finex, you'll see that it has surpassed them.

It is just kicking it down the road. Eveyone freaked out a few months ago and then immediately forgot about as soon as the immediate price of their bitcoins was safe. 
The entire bitcoin mining system is built around using human greed to keep miners competing to increase hashrate to secure the network. It is clear that this solution is flawed and can create the opposite end result than was intended. This is a problem with bitcoin's current design, and the fact that people are trying to convince miners to please stop adding hashpower should be a big blinking  sign of that to every body.

Do you know how they calculated the $100 million number? I'm honestly curious. Is that the USD value of their transactions at the time they were made, or is that figured by taking the number of bitcoins they processed and multiplying it by the exchange rate at the time they released the number?

Minus the giant subsidies paid to miners via inflation of the money supply, which won't last forever.


This is not a pervasive problem outside of a few risky industries. If you see a business using a standard payment processing company, they are not experiencing high levels of chargeback fraud. If you see a company using a high risk payment processor, they are. Almost all of these businesses are going to be in specific industries. Like porn. As I addressed in a previous post.

I don't know. There are a number of buttcoin people that have gotten whacked, and a number of Bitcoin people who have gotten whacked. I think a lot of it hinges on who gets reported, and how blatantly they were advocating for it. 
If you get reported for telling people to vote in a thread, brigade an account, or advise people on getting around anti-vote manipulation css specifically to mass downvote posts in another subreddit, you're probably going to get banned. 
Don't be a dumbass if you are attached to your account, basically. 
I do think the rules could be a bit clearer because I think a lot of people genuinely don't realize it is a capital offense, but I imagine they leave them intentionally vague so they don't have to deal with "letter of the law" whining from people trying to game the system. This is a large high traffic site, and it is likely easier to shoot first and unban the people who made an honest mistake than it is to waste hours pouring over every post and vote someone violating the rules has made.

I post a lot, and I find it interesting to try to crack the code of why some comments get downvoted and some get upvoted. I think a lot of it is honestly timing. There aren't a huge number of people here at any given time, and like most of reddit, /new is manned by a much much smaller group that seems to be fairly consistent. Which people those are at the time you comment decides the fate of your comment/post.
Because of this, the tone of votes and comments of a post tends to get set before it hits the front page (and this is true of reddit, in general). Going against the flow of the mob once they have already gathered is going to result in downvotes. If you are posting in threads that are already on the frontpage, this is what is going to happen. It is less to do with being negative and more to do with being contrary in that specific context. You can sometimes avoid this by being entertaining, having the RES tag Library of Alexandria, or being able to pull random facts out of your ass.
This is actually not a strange outcome because the people participating in the thread are the same ones scoring your comments.
If you want to change the tone of the subreddit, regularly voting and commenting in /new is pretty much the only way to elevate your opinions above the noise.
Sometimes you're just going to get downvoted, though. Personally, I just stick to the old adage.
"I'm losing karma on every post, but I'll make it up in volume!"

If this is possible to do, then him shutting down his service isn't going to do anything to solve the actual problem. I mean, this is a standard argument given here for any number of things people want to shut down or stop.

A tiny amount of people spend their bitcoin, which decreases even further when the price dumps and they bail out of Bitcoin forever after losing piles of actual money.

Jesus christ, dude. It was in the comment that you are obsessing over.


Why is this so difficult for you. Honestly the fact that you are still claiming I said I find bitcoin funny, rather than it clearly being attached to a qualifying statement assigning "funny" to something that wasn't bitcoin, is starting to get sort of weird.

Yes. People spend bitcoins when the media is watching, which I get downvoted for saying all the time, but which all the available numbers bear out.

It isn't nearly costless for them, though. Much like the existing payment systems, there are costs of business that have nothing to do with the primary task of shifting marbles between account buckets or updating a database. This is especially true with places that are dealing with cash/bitcoin conversions, and the entire payment processing market that barely exists even with truckloads of money being poured into merchant adoption. This is why they are gobbling up millions of dollars in investment money, and why credit cards, western union, and paypal have fees that people complain about here constantly as a selling point for using bitcoin.
There has to be a profit model somewhere. Currently you have coinbase, who is aiming for a world in which you buy bitcoins from their stockpile, store the bitcoins in their system, buy a thing with bitcoin from a coinbase merchant who then accepts USD from coinbase, and then sells you back an equivalent amount of bitcoin from the same stack you just gave them for a 1% fee. It is the most useless middleman ever invented.
On the other side of the aisle is BitPay, whose current business model seems to be selling bitcoins to coinbase and hoping to get bought by someone.
Changetip, who postponed their (insufficient for survival) fees yet again after a lifesaver was tossed to them by Pantera (who is now also the largest user of the service and greatly inflating their average tip amount stats) still struggles to go viral in a market that is littered with failed attempts to monetize something people don't want monetized.
The common denominator with all of these things is "who is going to pay for it when the subsidies end." I have not seen a good answer to that from anybody because the solution to one problem (dodging increasing fees and transaction limits by going off chain) makes the other problem worse (miners relying on higher fees from more transactions to keep the network going as the subsidies fade).
@_date: 2015-01-10 07:30:17
Determining how they managed to get the keys in the first place is a fairly critical question that needs to be answered before assuming that putting two locks on the safe and leaving everything else the same is an acceptable fix.

@_date: 2015-01-18 18:33:33


I think you can blame changetip pretty squarely since their entire business model relies on third parties not getting sick of them. For instance, a reasonable person might ask why they have created an army of "minion" accounts on twitter if it isn't an attempt to dodge the API rate limits, and what the result would be if twitter (or reddit) bans their bots.
It is a shaky house of cards pretty much across the board.

I'm sure there is some legitimate use. I'm also fairly certain that aforementioned hypothetical legitimate use would not account for anything approaching half of the total transaction volume.

Neither were most people. If you look at any of the numerous threads where people fess up to their actual cost basis, it is not pretty.
Mentioning this, despite it being obvious just from looking at the trading volumes and post volumes, apparently sends angry people to mash downvote on your userpage, though. 
It is hard to solve a problem that you are unwilling to admit to, but pretending that problems don't exist, or brushing them off as things that someone else will solve at some nebulous point in the future, is basically the bitcoin way.

I have no idea what OP's question was, because I didn't see the thread until someone triggered a username notification, and it was already deleted at that point.
I also have never actually posted on bitcointalk, though I do read the speculation forum when gets boring.
edit: I'm also just assuming this was my twitter account based on comments, and the assumption that someone who would sit on a reddit account for almost a month just to post this one dumb thread would be unable to count.
edit edit: 90% of my tweets are links to posts in this subreddit that a joke could be extracted from. It is kind of sad honestly. If I make jokes here, I'm a troll. If I make jokes in buttcoin, I'm a buttcoin troll. So I post mostly seriously here, which somehow also makes me an extra conniving troll. So I make jokes on a completely different website, on an account that is clearly joke oriented. Verdict: troll.

There are never very many actual details on these accounts. Some of them have ended up getting closed because they were using personal accounts as business accounts. Some of them appear to be because of high rates of fraud reported in dealing with bitcoin companies or sales.

Stamp, an exchange that had to shut down because someone stole their bitcoins did 10x the coinbase moon volume today, despite completely avoiding ever mentioning how their coins got stolen or why it wouldn't happen again. Bitfinex, an exchange birthed from bitcoinica code by a pirateat40 ponzi pumper that was just in bitcoin news because one of the owners was trading on their exchange did closer to 40x the coinbase moon volume. 
I think they will be ok for a while, because the bitcoin trading community is almost entirely composed of actual goldfish.

The author of this piece is the same guy who created "Bubble Theory" back in 2014. He briefly became a bitcoin prophet, predicting the next bubble down to the very day, and signing his posts with a countdown to the Day of the Bubble.
His posting style of making numerous and often contradictory claims in each post and burying them under a huge pile of words was able to fool a largish number of people who should have known better into thinking that he knew what he was talking about.
After the Great Bubble failed to appear, he invented false bubbles and reverse bubbles to avoid having to admit he was wrong about anything. Then he got shadowbanned for advocating vote brigading and rage quit via his brother's account and fled to the safety of his  "thoughts" forum that this post is from, where he rules with the world's loneliest iron fist.

This particular criticism is usually brushed off by asking how much energy the normal banking system uses. Like, pretty much every time it is raised. Of course, this ignores how little energy basically any other system would use to process seven transactions per second. Which is really the issue here...the bitcoin network uses ever more power to do exactly the same task, at the same rate. 
It would be like the security guard in your example demanding that his pay be doubled every month, while doing less work than the old guard that was already there and doing a great job.

You're right. Nobody knows much about him, or what his plans for the coins are, or why he hasn't spent them. There are any number of possibilities.
The fact is, that you don't know either. 
The difference between us on this issue, is that I'm willing to acknowledge it as an issue because I don't have a financial or ideological interest in the success of bitcoin.  It is really odd to see people so paranoid about the government printing money in their monetary system, while being totally fine with the looming specter of Satoshi's gold forever hanging.

This is what is baffling to me. You agree that the tweet is very weird, which leads to the assumption that you understand both the context of the tweet and the content being referred to by the tweet.
But here we are, with you unable to draw any conclusions as to why that is distasteful or why his jovial attitude, tweets, and dumping price would possibly lead someone to think he was going to be okay, or why the content of the tweet would be completely distasteful in that context.

You seem to be pushing off chain transactions as a way to dodge ever increasing transaction fees. The fees currently are held in check by low demand and mining subsidies.
The unspoken point that you left out is that the zero/low transaction fees currently being provided by off chain solutions are also being kept artificially low because they are being subsidized by venture capital. It seems like depending on the continued existence of this subsidy, especially without a massive increase in consumer interest fairly soon, to sidestep a looming fee problem with the bitcoin network is a risky proposition.
(this is completely ignoring that you are proposing entrenching centralized third party middlemen as a way to keep the network from becoming centralized.)

Overstock's sales didn't drop off 90%, just their bitcoin sales. Because the media attention faded, and buying things was no longer likely to drive up the price of bitcoins.

So you didn't really make a prediction. You made a shit post, had nothing relevant to back it up, flailed around a bit, and now pretend that questioning your original premise was a waste of time, despite not having anything that remotely resembles support for your dumb "prediction."

Chargeback fraud is fairly uncommon outside of the industries you generally see forced into high risk payment processors (porn, for example) which is one of the few places I've actually said that bitcoin makes sense. The problem is that in most of those industries, their income is also fairly dependent on screwing consumers via forgotten recurring subscriptions.
In regards to this:


If that was the case, why do you feel like a payment method that completely obliterates consumer recourse is a good and necessary thing? 




Ah, ye olde anecdote. I guess we could talk about people who paid in bitcoin and got shafted by shady sellers? Or maybe discuss why there are so many consumer protection organizations compared to organizations protecting merchants against their customers? 
Or we could just yell about paypal, or whatever. Up to you really.

Yes, this is basically my thesis statement. People shop when there is media attention, and stop spending in any numbers as soon as the chance to attract new people fades. Look at any "x merchant accepts bitcoin!" thread and you'll see it is people going "I never shop here nor do I really need anything but I bought all this stuff!"


There has been a 41% drop since November. I would also open up "exclude popular" in one window, and the full transaction chart in another. Now look at what is being excluded. It is nearly all gambling.
Now ask yourself, if transactions have remained essentially flat on the full chart, what is actually going on? It would seem that what is actually going on is people are gambling less now that there are other things to spend bitcoins on, but the number of people spending bitcoins, is likely fairly flat. It seems disingenuous to exclude gambling when it was/is such a large part of the bitcoin economy, in my opinion.


Why do you think this, when the recommendation is to use unique addresses for just about everything?


It really isn't. It is about what you would expect from a massively hyped speculative bubble that is gaining very little traction in actual usage in comparison to the media attention it is gathering.

I'm not sure how you could look at those numbers and decide it is skyrocketing. 


I don't think they are gaming them or they wouldn't have spent so long awkwardly not releasing them after 2013 black friday numbers. It took forever to finally get someone accidentally posting later numbers, and even longer to finally get confirmation that they were greatly exaggerating other numbers. Probably because of all that growth.


Sure, and I've broken that down in a number of other comments over many months.

Because the demand for them to accept bitcoin greatly outweighs the number of people who will actually spend bitcoins there if they actually accept them. There are costs associated with maintaining another payment system, both in ongoing staff training (see every post where someone tries to pay with bitcoin and nobody knows how to work it) and lost sales due to displaying additional payment options (see Mozilla A/B test results). 
Now that accepting bitcoin doesn't get you a free evening news or WSJ pump, there just isn't a great reason to deal with the hassle or expense for something that nobody is really going to use. 
There are a few exceptions for businesses that cater to bitcoin enthusiast specific markets like precious metals, bitcoin mining gear, and means to convert bitcoins into gift cards (which are still the largest markets based on release payment processor stats). 
Otherwise, why would they bother? The adult industry is an obvious target because they are generally forced into high fee credit card processing, but their business models also often rely on recurring payments, which bitcoin is awful for.

I miss those days of posting. unfortunate robocop rule set and the change of rules to stamp out the unbridled mockery required to stop this sort of dumbass shill posting has really taken a toll on this place by upsetting the natural balance of the ecosystem.

It is probably a good idea for you to go learn about what banking services already exist before dreaming about a better solution to replace them, quite honestly. This seems to be a large and continual problem on this subreddit. 


The legacy system is more expensive, in total, because it dwarfs the bitcoin network, and is provides services that bitcoin does not. That is the crux of this argument, and something that you don't appear to be able to grasp. 


Your first point is irrelevant, your second point is basically saying that we should resolve problems that already have working solutions in the most complicated way possible in order to create busy work for our species.


Yes, because it is sort of crucial to the argument that bitcoin is going to take over the financial world.


Ah, there is the wiki link. Both systems being based on computers has absolutely nothing to do with anything. Throwing more or hardware at the bitcoin network does nothing to increase the number of transactions it is capable of.

The post I linked to is the reason they added the chain filtering. The chain filtered chart still includes change transactions. There is no chart on their site that filters chains and change, which means that the actual numbers are even lower than the filtered one that you just posted. 
The chart they offer that filters change (both the btc and USD volume ones) show the growth completely stagnant for the last year. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:41:56
Yes, that is all banks do is charge backs and payments.
That's it. They do not provide any additional services. Nope. Not here in at least.


Bitcoin is by its very nature less efficient than centralized solutions. It trades efficiency for decentralization. The transactions on the bitcoin network could be processed by a 386 in someone's closet. Instead, a mind boggling amount of resources are devoured to do the task because it is decentralized.
Pretending the bitcoin network is a more efficient solution is a weird stance to take. 


I think it is safe to say that bitcoin in its current form cannot support anywhere close to seven billion users.

This has been obvious for months and months, it was just difficult to get the data after they clammed up after Black Friday 2013.
If you compare the number of merchants they've reported at various times with the transaction volume data that's been released or leaked (through Q1 2014), they had been butting up against ~3tx/merchant/month for most of that time period. Because of the heavily skewed merchant size, and based on the new stats, heavily skewed industry weighting (which was exactly the same skew they had in 2013) you quickly come to the conclusion that a large portion of their merchants have probably never seen a bitcoin transaction from an actual customer.

Except that most of them see a negligible number of bitcoin sales, and the savings don't outweigh the cost of maintaining a second payment system that nobody uses. Despite this, some merchants still offer bitcoin payments. The result of this is all the posts here about people trying to use bitcoin somewhere and none of the employees know how to process the payment, or finding out that they stopped accepting it because nobody used it.

The biggest roadblock to merchant adoption is the lack of customers that will actually spend bitcoins at places that accept bitcoins. There is no financial incentive for a place to support an additional payment method that is rarely, if ever, used.
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:04:41


The problem is that this isn't true.


Costs something.


Staff training, customer service training, book keeping, losing sales like Mozilla.


Because it is unlikely that you will see enough sales to make it worthwhile to implement and maintain. Overstock is seeing four international bitcoin transactions a week, and that is a giant company that has a CEO that is a certified bitcoin enthusiast who runs around promoting bitcoin constantly. Wordpress was seeing two a week.
At the current time, there is just no benefit for the average merchant, and an added risk that you are going to get blowback from angry bitcoin enthusiasts who never bought anything from you if you decide to stop accepting it.

It's a bitcoin miracle! Clearly. I mean, what other explanation could there be?
@_date: 2015-04-21 23:08:51


It is hard to even know how to respond to this because it is so bizarre. Credit cards served a purpose not served by cash. As a payment technology, bitcoin is largely filling the same consumer niche as every other electronic payment system.


If that was actually the case, there wouldn't be so many stories about people having no idea how to process bitcoin payments, even at larger merchants.


You could, other than the fact that there was consumer demand for multimerchant revolving credit lines because it solved a problem that people actually had that hadn't already been solved with other methods.


Large companies have largely adopted because it doing so used to mean you got written up in the news, and for a brief period, the small collection of bitcoin enthusiasts would flood you with orders in an attempt to get more news to pump up the price of bitcoin. Neither of these things really seem to be happening any more.


Let's talk about Overstock, because it is a fairly good illustration of this phenomenon, and they have shared many of their numbers. 
$3 million was a dismal failure for them, and only a fifth of what they were projecting based on the aforementioned flood of enthusiasts hoping to pump up the price and/or cash out.
The first million of that came in the first two months, with sales rapidly declining throughout the rest of the year. Their international launch has only managed to make four sales a week.
The reason they still appeared positive about the numbers is because they launched while bitcoin mania was still going on, bitcoin enthusiasts weren't all terribly underwater, and they got a shitload of free advertising out of it.
Again, none of these things are still the case, and haven't been for a number of months. New merchants who don't have frothing bitcoin enthusiasts as CEO are not going to see this benefit, and in fact, haven't.


The growth rate of the bitcoin economy has basically ground to a halt. The USD transaction volume has been essentially unchanged for the last year.
Coinbase's data shows that after all the hype, their business is largely selling video games to Californians. BitPay's sales are nowhere near the $1mil/day they were claiming previously, and largely consist of mining hardware and people cashing out to gold, just like they did in 2013.


In comparison to other electronic payment systems that have launched, its stagnating growth and lack of consumer demand should be a huge red flag.


I don't know why this is so difficult. You are only making more profit if your savings on transaction fees outweigh the costs of deploying, maintaining, and supporting a separate payment method. 
If you are spending $10/month to make sure your register employees remember how to use the dusty unused tablet you bought to accept bitcoin, and you are saving 3 cents in fees from the one guy who comes in and buys coffee from you every month, it is a net loss.
In fact, it may be costing you money in lost sales just to accept it.
You can also examine whollyhemp's large data dump. I would say ask them, but they found out the other problem with accepting bitcoin and got harassed off the forums by angry bitcoin enthusiasts.

As long as by "has had control of their own private keys," you are excluding all the people who lost coins from bad RNGs, the teamviewer debacle, malware, accidentally sending their coins to the wrong address, wiped/broke their phone, drive failures, etc etc etc.
So basically if you restrict the group to people who haven't irretrievably lost their bitcoins, nobody has ever lost them!
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:18:35


Electronic payments are a thing that already exists and that merchants have embraced, is the critical difference.


Unless the bitcoin network is maintaining staff training, then you are already wrong.


2-5% of 0.1% of your sales is not a very good incentive to maintain a payment method.


Most of them don't, if you haven't noticed. The ones that do have largely been for ideological or PR reasons (or in Overstock's case, both). The PR effect of accepting bitcoin has largely faded, along with the sales it brought originally.


In fact, we are beginning to see the opposite effect, where merchants that were previously accepting it are abandoning it because nobody uses it. Wordpress for the most obvious example.


As previously stated, electronic payment is a popular thing that already exists. The situations aren't comparable.


The other thing that bitcoin lacks entirely is a compelling reason or consumer demand for merchants to adopt it.

These types of figures have been calculatable since 2013 if you are capable of combining the numbers from their various blog posts and doing the math. Even at their black friday 2013 peak, three transactions per merchant per month was an optimistic high point.
If you further extrpolate based on how heavily weighted their volume is towards the mining industry, people cashing out to gold, and people cashing out to giftcards, and look at the big merchants in those categories, you'll quickly realize that most of their merchants have probably never seen any bitcoin sales.

If you think that's the message people are receiving from luminaries yelling about anti-fragile and hand wringing about governments trying to "ban math" I think you are in for a rude awakening.
For a great example of the disconnect between what the salesman message is and what the reality of the developer reality is, you only have to scroll up a few comments to see Mike clearly describing that the scary men with guns in funny costumes that people like Ver and Voorhees have been assuring people that bitcoin is an antidote for are actually the only current method of dealing with tx floods. 
There has been a distinct lack of reality injection to the general community from the developers to counterbalance the endless flood of intentionally disingenuous and misleading bullshit from big investors and bitcoin "thought leaders" over the years. I think it is probably one of the biggest drivers of this angry mob that has formed over the block size issue.

Changetip was a flavor of the week that offered a promise of being a killer app that would take bitcoin viral and thus make people who owned bitcoins fabulously wealthy. When that failed to happen, the bitcoin goldfish memory activated and moved on to the next thing. (Overstock! Newegg! Microsoft! PayPal! GBTC! Lunar! Gemini!) 
The reality is that unless your bitcoin offering enriches people for doing nothing (and rather quickly) it will stop being interesting and they will move on to the next shiny and you'll get a lot less interest trying to get people to send their bitcoins somewhere that has no hope of boosting the price than you will giving away tiny promotional changetips (which are less interesting now that it is clear that changetip isn't a moon vector.)

If people are assuming the worst at all times, it is a good indicator that the worst happens often enough that it has become the default assumption and you should either suck it up and own it if you feel that it is justified, or alternately reconsider the actions that have lead people to default to assuming the worst rather than awkwardly trying to hide it, which only adds to the assumption that the worst is in fact happening.
This current series of events isn't the only things leading people to these assumptions. Since I've been posting here, there's been mods running troll accounts while consistently provoking and banning people for trolling, mods running questionable organizations and going dark after being questioned about it, mods silently deleting comments that weren't breaking any rules, mods advocating vote brigading, arbitrary temporary rules being put in place without ever being added to the sidebar, rules being ignored for certain posters while being applied to others, etc etc etc.
I've said it before, but just come up with an actual set of rules that are clearly stated in a permanent location in the sidebar that posters can follow to avoid having their posts deleted (or that will result in your posts being deleted) and enforce them consistently.

There's no technical reason bitcoin went to $1200 or dumped back down lower than the bubble before last. 
That seems like a weird criteria to base buying something that would have lost 96% of its peak value without giving any thought to why it had happened. 
If all the people who insisted they would be backing up the truck to load up on cheap coins at $800, $700, $600, $500, $400, and $300 actually had, instead of getting out of the way of the avalanche, perhaps they would have actually been cheap coins.

Much like trying to figure out how to keep from sucking actual posts into the gnashing jaws of automod, there's probably not a good answer that doesn't cause some other problem.
Let's say for example, that you enable flairs only for verified bitcoin company reps. This does allow Bitcoin Joe from Bitcoin Enthusiast, Inc. to post comments that people know are true and honest. It does absolutely nothing to stop Bitcoin-Joe, Bitcoin_Joe, BTC-Joey, and one million other joke accounts from posting whatever they want, while people assume they just aren't verified for whatever reason, the same way it is now when one of the endless series of Charlie Shrem themed accounts posts something.
Personally, I think you should just enable flair globally because honestly this is reddit and people want to have fun posting on the internet. Being able to add a companion message to the RES tag that is probably following you around anyway is actually a good thing.

"I really believe in bitcoin. It is the future of the world. I look forward to the continued price increase and one day I plan to own my own island. I will truly be a bitcoin billionaire by the time I am 25 I believe."
"It was nearly impossible to sell for bitcoin because I had to get 3 lawyers, and the real estate lady (originally it was a private sale), and it had to be $1 plus the bitcoin, as bitcoin are not legal tender in Canada so can't be used as 'consideration' in financial transactions. By the time all the smoke cleared I got 648 btc. But if it is going to $10/$100K per coin like the Winkle guys are saying and many others, then I am set for life"

I think the problem you are going to run into is that the bitcoin community is so small that trying to create another general purpose splinter subreddit is going to result in tumbleweeds, like what's happened to basically every other one that has been attempted.
This is even more true if you aren't willing to give the subreddit up and also appear to be looking for someone else to do all the work making it popular for you.
Even the more active offshoot subreddits are dead at times. bitcoinmarkets has been able to maintain a moderately active community by consolidating all the discussion into a single daily post. 
You should either give it to someone that is willing to do the work and not squat on something you aren't willing to promote, or give up the dream until you actually have time to do something with it.

The difference is that at some point an angry bitcoin enthusiast who didn't know that the word virtual has more than one definition got real mad about about people calling bitcoin a virtual currency and ever since there has been an endless parade of retconned reasoning as to why bitcoin is totally not a virtual currency.
"existing or occurring on computers or on the Internet"
"carried out, accessed, or stored by means of a computer, especially over a network."

I tend to get downvoted if I comment on posts that are already on the front page. I have an anti-fan club. haha


I don't think I'm overlooking it, I just think that factoring in convenience is actually a negative to bitcoin in its current state.


From the consumer perspective, I think this is also a negative. You are either faced with becoming a security expert and jumping through convoluted hoops or storing your coins with a third party, which comes with its own string of problems.
A relevant example. After Gox happened and people's personal data got snatched, a large number of bitcoin enthusiasts here were encouraging people to piggy back on the free identify theft protection being offered as a result of the Target breech. 
Getting a new card is a minor pain in the ass. Having your funds irretrievably stolen with no recourse because of any number of minor mistakes or oversights, is absolutely disastrous.
(Convincing consumers to deal with these issues when other payment options without these sorts of liabilities exist is a HARD sell. 
edit: changetip's functionality has basically nothing to do with bitcoin. It is moving electronic marbles between buckets in a rickety database. Essentially the only benefit they are getting from using bitcoin is avoiding the requirements that surround running a business that holds and transfers other people's money.

It appears to have become an issue sometime in the second half of 2013. If you restrict your searching to 2012, you'll find that there is basically no objection to the word virtual. 
By the end of 2013, people were angrily ranting about it and campaigning to have conferences stop using the 'v' word.
It would take some digging to find the earliest reference. It is a bit murkier than the sudden massive shift in public opinion to "bits" from mbtc, which is fairly easily traced to a Bitpay branding effort.

It is a weird thing about bitcoin that the answer to every alt coin or similar development is that any new features will be absorbed by bitcoin, but the reality is that it is so increasingly burdened by people's financial stake and warring ideologies that nobody can even agree on how or when to solve existing problems, much less make large changes to functionality.

That is definitely one point of view regarding slamming easily bypassed paywalls and micropayments on top of content, sure.

The issue with bitcoin is that most of the perceived cost benefits are largely a result of unsustainable subsidies from massively inflationary block rewards and venture capital injections, and most of the other talking point benefits aren't something most people care about unless they've got a pre-existing ideological or financial investment.

It isn't a straw man. I was directly replying to your actual post.

Each candle is the price movement during the given time period. In this case, five minutes. The thin wicks at the top/bottom of a candle represent the high/low for that time period. The solid portion represents the opening/closing price. Red candle means the price went down, green means it went up.
The bottom of the chart shows the trading volume during that period, expressed in number of coins traded.
Hope that helps.

If you're losing money mining, but can rent time on your mining rigs for a profit and push the losses on to clueless speculators, it would make great sense.

Here is the part in the conversation where you puff up and pretend you called me out, despite the exact opposite thing happening, because you feel safe that people will now upvote you.
Let's recap.
I answered a question.
You got mad.
You said a lot of dumb things that anybody with a brain cell could verify were incorrect.
You hastily edited your first comment to call me a buttcoiner, while doubling down on your blatantly incorrect assertions.
You tell me the votes have it, and then make an embarrassing display about how wrong I am.
Shameful, buddy. Very shameful.
The worst part of this is that I agree with you that Darkwings was a douche, and we could have happily agreed on that while also agreeing that his prediction of the bitcoin price (you know, what this thread was about before you went bonkers) was correct.

The key to being a successful bitcoin (person who posts about being an) investor is to latch onto pithy sayings as if they are actual wisdom.
If you can do it from a brand new account and pretend that you're just now learning about bitcoin and yet are magically able to regurgitate tired talking points, even better, imo.

I have loads of godawful perl code to pull an astonishing amount of useless exchange/mining pool data using an increasingly horrifying series of regular expressions, each one shortening braydenh's life by several years as he tries to copy them in whatever horrible system he is using at the moment.
Aside from the aforementioned issues, your use of curly braces for s/// and the weird shuffle/grep/map combo for password generation (which were inexplicably joined with spaces) instead of using one of the eight billion cpan modules that do the same thing but not awful made me want to die inside, but then be immediately resurrected to experience the joy of braydenh being angry about someone using perl.

The problem with proof of reserves is that it only covers one side of the books. 
If I run a business where people can mail me marbles to sell, and other people can mail me cash they want to use to buy marbles, and I have a website where they can place orders to buy or sell marbles from the cash and marbles deposits I'm keeping for them...oh no, my house got robbed! Many marbles are missing! I go to the store and buy replacement marbles using customer cash deposits. I then post a picture of all the marbles next to today's newspaper. This is essentially what proof of reserves is. 
The solution is an actual professional audit of the exchange's books, which is something that exchanges have a list of excuses for avoiding.

Pretty much. I have mostly stopped posting on buttcoin unless someone mentions my username or there's an interesting self post. It made arguing with people here nearly impossible because every conversation would just get shut down with "BUTTCOIN TROLL" and it gets too confusing trying to remember what threads here I found over there and am not allowed to vote / participate in.
The bad posts in are generally people trying to sound smarter than they actually are. The bad posts in are generally people trying to sound funnier than they actually are. Most people are bad at posting, is the sad the truth.
The downvote issue is mostly a problem with the way reddit is, and not a bitcoin specific problem, though the ideological/financial incentives do probably exacerbate it a bit. I think you just have to sort of expect it when you have a contrary opinion. I've found that sticking mostly to /new alleviates a lot of it, because most posts die in /new and most of the small batch of people who read it are more interesting and/or entertaining than the people who live on the frontpage.
Really the only things that annoy me are when people mash downvote on something that is already buried, because they've had to manually either click on the expand button or change their preferences to see the comment, or people who mash downvote on things they reply to. It never made sense why someone would want to bury the comment they are replying to, since that also buries their stupid ass reply.
Such is life on the internet.

I opened an account at a credit union 20 years ago and they send me a new card if somewhere that I bought something gets compromised and cover any fraudulent transactions that slip through. 
Also all my deposits are insured and they give me a discount on cars, insurance, a Sam's membership, cheap tickets to events, cheap loans, and friendly customer service. 
I guess I could have bought a new laptop, and posted about it to the Internet, but whatevs. 
They didn't make me get a tattoo of my PIN. Maybe I should shop around.

jesus christ, man. i can't tell if you're arguing from a position of bad faith or idiocy.
being "propped up by the fact that people are willing to prop it up" isn't what makes a pyramid scheme. depending on a constant flow of bottom rung "new money" investors is what makes a pyramid scheme.
i guess if you are insane, you can consider the full faith and credit of the US government, and the largest economy in the world, as a bottom run investor, but again, you would be an actual crazy person, and should probably stop posting, because the moon is out, and you can go bark at it.

he spent all the money he saved on payroll by having cat ladies and pedophiles moderate his forums (as well as having his ad guy surrender his $30k/year salary for 2013) on ambien and cheap wine. it is possible that it was head injuries from getting beaten nearly to death by uwe boll, which would also explain the weird youtube videos he makes where he yells over video games with a diaper fur.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:04:24
it is an issue if anybody actually wants to use it as anything other than a pyramid based speculative instrument.
for instance, there was a lot of misplaced snoop dogg album hype here in the last week. as a reference, with the bitcoin network locked at 7 transactions a second, it would take 31 solid hours for it to process the first week of sales for snoop's first solo album.
that is the reality of what we are dealing with here.

once the price of bitcoin stops rising for any appreciable period of time, people are going to start cashing out, and the people who pounce on cheap coins are going to find that there is nobody left to sell them to.
so yes, it does depend on new money.

@_date: 2013-12-24 05:14:43
let's start small and just give some facts, and i will let you draw conclusions. 
one person owns 1/12 of the bitcoin economy. he is a shadowy anarchist that nobody knows the identity of. compare this to the current market depth on any exchange.
one company, possibly run by a teenager, controls 30% of the current mining community.
the FBI has 144k bitcoins. sheep marketplace had 96k bitcoins. silk road 2 bust probably has ~100k. that is 2% of all the bitcoins on earth. compare these to the market depth on any exchange.
the people currently hyping bitcoin are either hyping it for political reasons, or to increase the value of their holdings. now imagine wall street actually gets involved in a large way and the resulting effect that will have on the few people actually propping up the bitcoin economy by buying things.
examine the bitcoin rich list. what are those people currently doing? compare / contrast to internet penny stock forums, MLM schemes, and speculative bubbles. include youtube channels, social media, and conventions in your analysis.
anyway, that's a lot of typing. peace.

i think it is important to note, that your incorrect spelling of "bated breath" is a clear sign that you have no idea what you're talking about and just spout things that you've heard that you think sound smart, without bothering, or caring, to understand what they actually mean.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:41:00
Because they desperately need new money to prop the price of their stash. It's easier to get a noob to get on board with paying 3.00 for something and feel that they got a value, than it is to get a noob to pay 3,000 for something. 
The pyramid is getting shaky.

@_date: 2013-12-24 02:18:48
you need to think about how comfortable you are with a client sitting on an invoice for 90 days that lists whatever the "current" bitcoin price is, because that is fairly common if you are dealing with larger companies rather than individuals. i say this because it is very unlikely that anybody is going to choose the "pay with bitcoin" option other than during a conveniently timed bitcoin market crash.
if you are just looking to collect bitcoins, maybe it doesn't matter.

Is there like a bitcoin argument school that directs you to only use ridiculous edge cases in your arguments?
You're right. The Internet, email, the horseless carriage, electricity...all those things took off. Of course, you ignore all the fuckup predecessors and other abandoned technological marvels that were going to revolutionize society. I mean, of course you do. Why wouldn't you? Look at some old Popular Science magazines and see the amazing world we should be living in today. 
You are so bad at making worthwhile arguments that it isn't even interesting to have a lively debate with you. It's so bad that you've even sapped my will to laugh at you. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:43:15

yes, apple, microsoft, and google are currently paying taxes only because evading them is too much work. transferring massive sums of money out of the country is suddenly not subject to regulation because it's in bitcoins. what big firm could resist subjecting themselves to destruction at the hands of the IRS. it is a mystery. long live bitcoin.

let's be honest, you're going to be living in your parents house in 50 years after chasing paranoid lunatic kookery and get rich quick schemes for decades. they will be long dead and gone, but still sitting on the couch with a look of shame on their faces, as you awkwardly watch tv around them.

Nothing. 
Which brings us back to square one.
Edit: also voting down a comment you are replying to is hilarious. What is even the point other than attempting to bury your shame?

you serious posted on a site that exists to make fun of stupid shit like bitcoins. that's the only reason the site exists. the person who runs the site, makes money, making fun of people who are serious about the dumb shit he puts on the site. why would you serious post bitcoin evangelism there?
it is shameful, tbqh, and you should feel ashamed right now.

aren't you the guy that was posting about how the crash was no big deal on the basis that you'd lost tens of thousands of dollars when your previous investments crashed?
it is hard to take anything you post seriously after that, especially when you post something like this where all the existing evidence points toward exactly the opposite conclusion.

@_date: 2015-02-22 19:41:00
The only convincing argument is showing them figures from other companies who have obtained enough new business from accepting bitcoin that it has made up for the costs associated with accepting it. 
This is a bit of a problem because most of the numbers that do exist show that nobody really spends bitcoin at these places, with the occasional exception of an initial burst of publicity driven interest. 
Overstock's international bitcoin launch is only generating 4-5 transactions a week, for example. 
There have been several reports here from people attempting to use bitcoin at CEX locations. The thing they had in common was that they were all the only people who had ever asked about bitcoin at the store, and nobody at the store had much of a clue about how to actually process the transactions.

he risked no time, no electricity, no cpu costs (or he'd have been canned or jailed, but hey, he vanished so not unlikely), and no hardware costs.
you can say "no fiat is necessary!" but you're dealing with a currency with a finite number of units. let's say every current bitcoin holder wanted to insure their stash. please explain how this works. i'm on the edge of my seat.
yes, gosh, what a revelation. backing up your wallet is insurance against a lost wallet. i would recommend, i don't know, reading the thread and seeing why that came up before posting the equivalent of making fart noises with your mouth.

Those reasons have nothing to do with why bitcoin is corrupt. The fact that the markets are low volume and unregulated and manipulated by high rollers do.

there's no way of knowing whether bitcoin is truly sound, in the manner of "will people actually accept the massive losses to consumer protection, the huge learning curve in computer security, and additional hassle required for buying things with bitcoins, in order to further a political agenda that only a small percentage of the population gives a shit about?"
well, actually, now that i put it that way.

i think in general you buy some of it from an exchange, then have issues with tech support (which you post about), then have issues cashing it out (which you post about), then give up and leave it in btc which makes you feel all high and giddy (which you post about), then maybe you buy a trinket from a spam post here (which you'll post about), then you have all your bitcoins stolen (posting opportunity) and get shunned by 2FA advocates, who will definitely be posting, and then you finally realize this is a really stupid idea.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:56:24
Won't really know that until the end of January.  It will probably get worse. 
There is also the glaring fact that bitcoin Black Friday was such a dismal failure. Exchange transactions can grow as much as they want, but a large merchant trying bitcoin and finding it not worth the effort is going to be a disaster. 
It is likely that the potential market of people interested in bitcoins is much smaller than you think it will be. Once it hits the saturation point, goodbye exponential growth, hello slide to irrelevance. 
There are also a number of looming issues, both technical, and with the bitcoin community that have a high chance of crushing growth.
Your assertion that it will just continue I'm at this pace is unsupported and fairly unlikely.

lol, come on man. 15 years ago was 1998. literally every place accepted credit cards. honest question, were you an adult in 1998?


lol, seriously, you are delusional. the only thing the advent of the checkcard did was let people use debit cards at credit card only locations (because, again, literally everywhere took credit cards), and this has been made completely irrelevant because everywhere that accepts credit cards now has PIN pads, and accepts debit cards.

They provide an endowment that funds the prize. They don't choose the winners. The winners are chosen in the same manner as the original prizes, by the same people. The prizes are awarded in conjunction with the "original" prizes in Alfred Nobel's will. You're really stretching here, and I'm not entirely sure why, other than a grudge against Krugman.


He is literally writing as an opinion columnist for the NY Times, because that is his job. 
You only have to look at the rapid backlash against Max Keiser once he jumped on the alt-coin wagon to see what criteria bitcoin enthusiasts actually use to determine whether someone is a legitimate source of information. It is pretty straightforward.
- does this person say good things about bitcoin that might increase the value of my coins?
- does this person say anything that may decrease the value of my coins?
That is basically all there is to it. I don't really care about Krugman one way or the other, but pretending the only reason he speaks ill of bitcoins is because he just doesn't get it, man, is really embarrassing.

it hasn't created many new millionaires this year unless they've cashed out millions, which they haven't, because they can't.
the price of bitcoin is just as likely to crash back down to $1 as it is to go up to $10,000 next year. china is basically out, india is not looking promising. the exchanges are still as manipulated and difficult to get money out of as ever, retailers aren't taking bitcoins, they are still a huge pain in the ass and incredibly risky to use for normal people, the technical limitations still exist, the distribution of coins still presents a massive risk, the mining industry is shady as hell and consolidating.
so basically, things now are more like they were before the last speculative bubble than they were at the peak of it.

This is so dumb, and you know it is dumb.
You can shed faux tears about the poor merchants and their sad fees, but they pay them. Why? Because they sell more shit by accepting credit cards. Why is that? Because consumers like the convenience, fraud protection, incentives, extended warranties, auto-drafts, chargebacks, and the entire concept of nearly universal credit. 
Bitcoin is a neat idea that is a huge pain in the ass for consumers and offers no tangible benefits for anything other than esoteric edge cases that hardly anybody gives a shit about. At the same time, it introduces huge liabilities that the general yahoo toolbar installing population are never going to be capable of dealing with. 
So yes, you are taking a risk giving your credit card number for payment. The level of risk for a normal person (who is going to get a new card number as soon as a breach is reported, and is 100% covered for fraudulent charges) is basically zero compared to the risk of getting their private key compromised. 
You are living in a delusional paranoid world that basically nobody worries about. 
Edit: and your only retarded example even you admit is completely irrelevant. Jesus man.

Based on the available bitcoin sales numbers, it is likely this will backfire hilariously. Everyone wants to tweet at merchants to make them accept bitcoins, because it will drive up the price of bitcoins. By the numbers, nobody actually wants to buy anything with bitcoins.

It got replaced because the broadband revolution did two things. It got rid of independent ISPs and replaced them with media companies, and it made downloading music and movies feasible. 
The first step the new Internet overlords took was to stop propagating the alt.binaries hierarchy, and pirated files moved to other alt groups, which meant they had to go. Once alt was gone, and google rolled dejanews into their terrible google groups, usenet mostly died as a thing that normal Internet users cared about, and they just stopped offering it. 
There are only a few usenet providers left, who resell through a bunch of other companies, mainly as a way to feed binaries to NZB users. MySpace and the rise of corporate Web 2.0 social media was the last nail in the use of usenet for discussions by average joe Internet. 
Really the only thing saving it from utter destruction now is that it is easier to go after torrent users because they are uploading rather than just downloading, but it has driven a lot of NZB indexers out of business or underground. 
I'll try to dig up the link for you when I'm not on my phone. 
Edit: there was someone who was using old usenet archives to replay usenet in real time over NNTP starting from the 70's. Not sure if it is still around.

as for your second paragraph, i don't even know what to say. it is a mish mash of unrelated concepts that make absolutely no relevant point (or any point, really) at all. what are you trying to say? it sounds like you are saying credit card fees are more expensive than bitcoin transactions, therefore my savings account should have been invested in gold.

the issue is that right now people understand what tiny fraction of the bitcoin "wealth" is available to newcomers. if you make it seem like they are buying a "thing" instead of "a tiny part of a thing" they will pay more for it, and their overpayment is reflected in the price of the actual thing and amplified down the chain to the people squatting on top of mountains of bitcoins.

the end result is the same, and is essentially impossible to do in an irreversible manner unless you're rocking and rolling with the currency of the future. there really isn't even an equivalent to these sorts of monumental fuckups in the non-bitcoin world. you're not going to accidentally tip someone $20k, or accidentally pay a $20k atm fee, or accidentally get $20k cashback at the grocery store. or write a check for $20k over the intended amount. or forget your ATM PIN and have your bank account evaporate. or have your bank account hacked and have no recourse. 
bitcoin solves one problem that nobody was really asking to be solved, and in return provides a minefield of potentially financially devastating problems that the general public is never going to clamor for.

how successful do you think the internet would have been if Vint Cerf was camping on 1/10 of all the packets in existence, gave another 1/10 to "early adopters" and then started cajoling gullible bubble chasers to buy millipackets for "just a buck!"
hint: we would still be blasting on fidonet.
the problem is, there is nothing wrong with bitcoin: the technology. it is fairly interesting. there is a massive problem with bitcoin: the reality, and there are going to be a lot of crying bankrupt rubes before it is over.
the bitcoin business model is that of every other "fleece the n00bs and then cash out while they hold the bag" industry that has sprung up. i understand it probably isn't obvious if you're currently enveloped in bitcoinmania, but i'm having trouble thinking of anything that has resulted in a long term success for anyone other than the early adopters that followed this method of operation. there are entire industries springing up around bitcoin, and basically all of them are either propping up something that nobody wants (bitpay), hilariously shady (mining hardware/exchanges), blatant scams (jesus, just look at bitcointalk's offerings), publicity stunts (buy a tesla/spamsite now accepting upvotes and bitcoin!)...i don't know.

Ok great. That doesn't make your comparison any more relevant. The banks use more power because they are processing a ridiculously higher number of transactions. 
Even if there wasn't a hard cap on bitcoin transaction volume, this would still be the case. 
Just admit it was a dumb attempt at misdirection and we will move on with our lives.

The general suggestion is off blockchain transactions.

Good grief, man. People have been successfully using credit cards for decades. The merchants complain about the fees and then happily swipe cards all day long because consumers want them, and they will lose business by not accepting them.
Meanwhile, despite all the clamoring for bitcoin acceptance here, nobody wants to fucking spend them, even on the heavily promoted "spend bitcoins day." 
The few big names that have mentioned bitcoins have so far all ended up going "ha ha jk." 
You are really stuck on issues that consumers and merchants have accepted as a trade off. Consumers get credit, benefits, and protection, and merchants get increased sales. With bitcoin, retailers are still going to have to accept credit cards, consumers aren't going to spend them, and there is literally no reason to go through the hassle unless the retailer is either propping up their bitcoin investment, looking for free advertising to people who are going to pay with cash or cards anyway, or trying to make some political statement.
This is shameful, and you should be ashamed.

well, there is the bitcoin rich list which shows hoarding of a huge number of coins, and then there are the bitpay sales figures, which show spending at a very low level, and the bitcoin transaction figures which show most transactions are gambling.
if you have any other figures which contradict those, would be interested to see them. obviously due to the nature of bitcoin, it is hard to say with absolute certainty, but i've not seen much to point in any other direction.

I'm not trying to keep digging information out of you, but escrow and transfer fraud are very very common. I would recommend you go look at a couple of the many websites that exist detailing the more common scams and see if any of them resemble your transaction. 
Did they do the transfer directly into your account, or give you a check or something that you then wired some portion back to them? What escrow service was it?
Edit: common enough that pretty much every auction/classified/car buying site lists an insistence on transfers, or escrow companies the other party insists on using, as red flags that you're probably being scammed.

old style webforums are a lot more useful than reddit for continuing discussions. reddit is a link aggregator that is for some reason being utilized as a discussion forum, which it is really bad at. they are all just bad usenet replacements, unfortunately. 
reddit is bad at being a discussion forum. discussion forums are bad at letting users drive the content. both of them are bad at consolidating more of the internet into ever shrinking corporate shitholes.
the various anon boards are a weird compromise, but the destruction of the independent ISP by media companies and the inevitable removal of usenet as a standard service really has fucked up the promise of free wheeling internet communication for generations.

yes, in this subreddit, which is recruit central station. if you go to bitcoinmarkets, or bitcointalk.org and take a peek at the speculation threads, you'll find that they spend all weekend chomping at the bit for new retards to dump money into bitcoin so they can get rich.


bitpay, probably the largest bitcoin payment processor, had 6,000 sales on a heavily promoted black friday. hardly anybody buys anything with bitcoins for any reason other than hoping for a good blast of coverage to boost the value of their holdings.

Yes, gas, and some liquor store chains. That's about it. 
How does bitpay protect you from capital gains taxes? You are responsible for keeping track of your gains and losses, which are realized when you buy something with bitcoin. Which also means you need to keep track of what you paid for the coins you are spending, whether you've had them for more than a year, and the current market value of them when you purchase something. 
This is probably the biggest hurdle to making bitcoins useful for any transaction that can be made with a more standard payment option. At some point in the future, someone is going to be made an example of by the IRS.

it would be good if someone, say, wanted to buy drugs from someone who wasn't in the same zipcode. which is why bitcoins ever entered any sort of mainstream conversation, and now that the main source has been arrested and had a huge chunk of coins seized, and at least two followups have run away with more huge chunks of coins, things are sort of up in the air.
if wall street actually enters in any serious way, the chewy nougat center of the bitcoin community is going to be devastated as the whales and manipulators succumb to regulators and people with actual resources.

why is it so impossible to accept that the reason normal people don't give a shit about bitcoin has nothing to do with them "not getting it."
i know it hurts to hear, but a lot of people just think it is stupid, or a scam, or think the loudest proponents are retarded/annoying/gullible/ridiculous.

it is a lot different than owning a mid-sized business, because in pretty much every MLM business, the product is irrelevant. you will never make money selling whatever dumb product/scheme it is. you only make money selling the dream to other idiots who are stupider than you. the only people making money at these are the ones at the top of the pyramid, and the money doesn't come from selling products to consumers. it is seminars, and sample kits, etc. 
the fact that this isn't being laughed out of the subreddit is another one of those introspective warning signs that you should probably dig down deep and look at.
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:09:35
it could be. it could also be reddit retards who bought in high. there are fairly consistent patterns of posts, though. if the price goes back up we'll probably return to wordy fake posts about selling grandma on bitcoin and selectively picked articles with sensational headlines that make it seem like bitcoin is breaking through the mainstream.
right now the price is low so it is mostly posts trying to misdirect on china and general "bitcoin is awesome" schlock. there will be a run up on "i'm a shoeshine boy who is meeting with fortune 5 executives who want to buy bitcoins" as a rising indicator.

- buying bitcoins is a pain in the ass everywhere. if you are trying to buy bitcoins everyone will tell you "oh gosh go here!" and then when you have problems people will tell you "well only an idiot would go there."
- two weeks to get your bitcoins will seem better when you realize how long it is going to take you to get your money back out of an exchange.
- the only option is localbitcoins, so enjoy paying some weird fucker a huge premium and carrying loads of cash to meet someone from the internet.
- altcoins are just as valid as bitcoin, and usually share code. people like to hype up the open source nature of bitcoin, but anyone actually taking advantage of it and maybe accidentally wrecking the money they invested in bitcoins is met by angry SHITCOINS UGGGGH responses. you'll also get blasted about the network effect and then someone will post a graph about television adoptions or whatever. these people are idiots trying to protect their investment.
- if mining becomes unprofitable from block rewards, look forward to larger transaction fees, which is funny in so many different ways.

BitPay throws around dollar values and percentages rather than actual transactions, because based on their own numbers, their transaction volume is abysmal. Outside of the holiday shopping season, I think their top month was less than 700 transactions/day.
I am genuinely curious to see what their first quarter next year looks like, because retail businesses tend to make a large part of their yearly profits at the end of the year (hence, "Black Friday").

this would only be a sure thing if merchants stopped taking credit cards or cash. the situation you are proposing is basically assuming that customers will happily jump through pointless hoops (and give up any sort of consumer protection, incentives, etc) in order to save the store a percentage point or two on transaction fees. 
it is delusional to think that the only reason people aren't doing this now is just because merchants don't accept bitcoins. sorry.

So theoretically what happens if whoever controls those mystery coins were to start transferring them at a rapid pace in .01 increments, since the network is currently capped at 7 transactions a second, and prefers coins based on age.

That's because it is written to elicit a certain reaction from the true believers. Those late night infomercials about becoming a millionaire with real estate, or MLM, use the same basic tactic. This should send off warning signs to any sane person. Just browse through /new for a few days. You mention memes, but a huge part of it are these fake stories and spam.

I mean, it's okay to admit it, while still being able to criticize the recipient.


This is really the crux. He's a smart guy, so clearly he should love bitcoins! Any dislike or criticism of bitcoins means that he either doesn't understand it, or is just a filthy agenda driven liar, or maybe he's just not actually very smart, after all, his Nobel prize is fake!

i say nobody gives bitcoins, your response is honestly just gibberish.

if you read the post i'm referring to, you'll should see that it is not as good a theory as any, and in fact is worse than most any sane theory possible, including such obvious theories like "they want a cut of in app purchases."
i guess a corporate/bank/government/politician conspiracy to block bitcoins based on ideology is possible, as well, in an alternate universe where everyone is insane. (this is why i assumed you had an undying devotion to bitcoin, fyi).

This is a misdirection. Because "digital cash" that has to be spent via the internet is nothing like actual cash.


Again, a misdirection. How shocking. Most people don't keep thousands (or hundreds of thousands, or millions) of dollars in cash in their safe. They put it in a bank. Where it is insured. Or, they use a credit card, which is also insured against fraud and theft. Or, they pay for an insurance rider for their cash.


Oh boy! More misdirection! There are reputable businesses that will hold on to your cash where it is insured against theft. This does not exist for bitcoin, and it is unlikely that it ever will, unless the coins are insured for present "fiat" value, which is likely to completely fuck you because of shady markets and associated volatility.


Yes. Congratulations. This is why people like credit cards, and why merchants are willing to pay fees to attract the massive amount of people who want to use credit cards. You've cracked the code, and reiterated basically all of my posts while pretending to argue with me.


Those may be "advantages" but they are not net advantages, because of all the horrible consumer unfriendly baggage that they drag along with them.

"Pre-Order terms for new orders were updated on the website on April 1, 2013.  The terms state, "I accept the terms of the sale and understand that all sales are final and there is a backlog of orders and production &amp; delivery of my order may take **2 months or longer.**"
As a Wyoming Corporation, we operate under the US Federal Trade Commission's business guide for mail or telephone ordered merchandise.  The relevant guideline suggests that if no delivery terms are stated or agreed to, then 30 days should be assumed.  In our case, we've gone to great length to ensure there is no ambiguity.  **Customers are/were notified of the back order situation, the inability to cancel their order and the multi month wait to be expected.**"
Good luck with that!

Well, it depends, honestly. I obviously don't know your exact situation, but wire fraud and escrow fraud happen a lot, and it isn't necessarily the bank's fault if whoever was sending you money was committing fraud of some sort. I don't know the actual facts surrounding any of this, and I'm not going to keep asking you for them.
you really need to get back with the bank and figure out what exactly happened. i recommend not yelling at some beleaguered customer service rep until they hang up on you, as a first step. If you can't get a straight answer, make them escalate. 
best of luck. that's a shit thing to deal with.

I agree with you, for the most part. The problem is that we had an ideal solution, which has been replaced by things that are worse. One of the main benefits of usenet, other than being distributed, was that you could use any NNTP client to read it in whatever format was convenient. I do appreciate the Reddit API, and it does allow some interesting things, but it really is just a completely different concept, and their backend algorithms and filters are weirdly opaque and controlled by a single entity.
It is what it is. There was an interesting post here (which honestly was shocking to me) from a guy who was working on what was basically a P2P mash of reddit and NNTP. I can probably dig up the link if you're interested. I haven't had a chance to actually download it or mess around with it yet, but it appeared to be worth a look.
edit: another great benefit of usenet, which is lost to the ages, is nonchalantly crossposting angry replies to other groups. it would be a good feature to add to reddit, and I'm not even joking.

i call out people who are scamming, spamming, or idiots. granted, that is a large portion of posts in /new. i don't just do this here, and i don't just do this with this account. i've also got a pretty decent record of people deleting their posts and/or accounts after getting called out early before the retarded idiots who upvote spam, scams, and bullshit get on board. 
at least five yesterday.
if you want to give me shit about it, i don't care. just because i like to make fun of people doesn't mean i want them to get plowed in the ass by sharks. 
edit: sorry, i didn't answer your other question. you can make as many accounts as you want here. a lot of people who are involved in shilling whatever the fuck are also involved in shilling some other whatever the fuck, and probably social media lambo leaning dickweeds. it isn't really unlikely to have reserve accounts. if you look at the posts in /new, you'll see that the 0 day account obvious shit posts are moving towards 1 month and X day accounts, which makes me wonder what the actual human distribution of some of these posts are. it doesn't really matter though.

this is absolutely terrible investment advice. a diversified portfolio weighted towards your level of risk, usually based on years to retirement, with 3-6 months of cash on hand, is a much better idea.

because bitcoin's supposed "strength" is being a decentralized system that doesn't require you to trust/pay third parties for your transactions. you are recreating the existing merchant/payment processing system with all of it's problems to get around a technical limitation with bitcoin itself.

the fact that bitpay even exists should set off warning bells in any "long and strong" bitcoin supporter's head.

this tired and utterly broken analogy gets tossed around a lot, because it sounds really good. but the same thing isn't "bound to happen with bitcoin." 
maybe bitcoin is compuserve, or fidonet. maybe bitcoin is usenet, once the main way to talk about things on the internet, and now only a hazardous wasteland for pirates and pornographers.
nobody knows, and hyping (often with blatant deception) it to the moon to people who have no idea what they are doing and then shitposting "LOL SHOULD HAVE HAD 2FA IDIOT" when they lose thousands of dollars is fucked up.
so let's step back. if they aren't handling it on the blockchain level, how will they be handling it? by trusting third parties, i'm assuming, which is the eventual conclusion of every conversation about avoiding the transaction limits and blockchain growth. congrats, you've now taken away the point of bitcoins.

let's go through this point by point.


unless it doesn't go back up. or if it does go back up, they don't sell, and then it crashes and doesn't go back up.


you literally have no way of knowing this. a large percentage of the earth's population, which drove the price up in the first place, are now essentially out of bitcoin on 2014-01-31. When that happens, there is really no reason other than increased hype that the price shouldn't resettle where it was at the end of October.


While technically this may be true, OP, and most people here who get mad about log charts, want them because they obfuscate how massive the last dump was.
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:09:36

the point you're making is something that most people don't care about in comparison to how much of a pain in the ass buying groceries will be, especially when your solution involves storing your money in something as volatile as bitcoin.

i own 0 bitcoins, which will remain my balance for eternity.
in many ways, i am bitcoin's core audience. i am a software developer with libertarian leanings. i have disposable income. i am an early adopter of new technology. 
the problem is that my first involvement on the internet was wrecking scammers on usenet, and observing communities of true believers and the people who prey on them has been the source of most of my online entertainment ever since. this was very similar to my first exposure to bitcoins, as one of the slashdot editors attempted an embarrassing pump.
the bitcoin community is fucked, and unless there is truly big money coming in that is willing to strongarm the filth out of it, bitcoin is doomed for anything other than dark markets and the "burn the fed" communities. i don't say this in a darkwings_08 (peace be upon him) all capital letters panic post. i say this as someone who has seen this same slow motion trainwreck play out over and over again.
if the big guns actually do show up in any real way, the bitcoin community that currently exists is going to vanish, as they lose control of their creation. it (the ecosystem, not the technology) is truly a penny stock scam that accidentally got taken seriously.
if the community can be purged, there's a chance it will stick around for a while. if not (and the number of coins currently in the hands of unknown players makes this likely) it is just completely fucked long term.

The fact that tax implications aren't clear makes it more of a risk, not less of one. People have been trading and spending for years without considering any of this. Your mode of argument seems to be casual dismissal of something that is a big deal. "oh pfffft, someone will write something, someday, maybe." There haven't been any high profile audits because the IRS didn't even acknowledge any of this until this year. There hasn't been any guidance because they didn't feel it was worth the time or money to do so. Now that people are buying exotic cars and Wall Street is making noises, I wouldn't be so confident that their lack of interest in the past is any sort of indicator of how things are going to be going forward.
As for your second paragraph, it is still dumb, honestly. Gold is also in the midst of a bubble, and has started dropping again. Your argument about leaving large amounts of cash in your bank account losing value is also dumb, because you should be investing in a diverse portfolio of things that produce value to society, in addition to your shiny metals and bitcoins. 
Have at it.

your response is understandable. this is an insular community that feeds on itself. the echoing idea is that it is somehow mainstream and the road to riches. there is a purposeful shutdown of contrary ideas. every scrap of positive news is echoed even long past the point when it is debunked. every negative news just another sign that "they" are panicking at the rise of bitcoin. the market discussion focuses on price stagnation being just a factor of waiting on the "new money" which is due at any moment. 
i understand if you don't agree with me, and want to pick the weirder get rich quick examples to laugh at. but the bitcoin community and the MLM/SMM communities are fairly identical, as are the other ones I mentioned. even the psychic hotline ladders of the 90's. 
best of luck to you, but the only way to strike it rich in these things is to cash out at the top, you just have no idea where the top is unless you're one of the earliest, or just lucky.

which is why, much like western union and wire transfers, bitcoin is so attractive to scammers. i think most people are pretty okay with paying for not having to deal with that, as evidenced by the fact that bitpay processed something like .07 transactions per second on black friday, while Visa processed 11,000+.
currently the bitcoin protocol taps out at 7/second, so even running at full capacity, it will always be just a small fart in the ocean.

No. Bitcoin sucks for a great many normal consumer uses that aren't weird edge cases like "I need to send $1000 to Poland!"
It does some interesting things, but it is consumer unfriendly in many ways that are not resolvable without a third party insuring the risk. Which is sort of a problem, since much of the point is getting rid of those third parties.

i think the most exciting thing about bitcoin is how it inspires people to vote up vapid bullshit like your post, without bothering to examine things like the only reason you are having your money "stolen" from you via inflation is because you are supposed to do something with your money (like investing in useful businesses) that doesn't involve sitting on a pile of cum-soaked currency as you masturbate to ron paul videos.

I am going to give you a rare double props, for both looking at the post history of the person you are responding to, and for editing your post based on feedback from comments in the original thread. I did not realize you'd changed it when I posted my original comment, I just went and checked that it matched the previous post.
The dumbness, in my mind, is twofold.
- you fail to address many of the actual problems that are likely to sink bitcoin in the long term
- most of your strategies involved moving to alt coins, or desperately trying to cash out during the midst of a mass exodus
I think for the purposes of this post, you need to examine bitcoin as a standard investment, with the weird situation that bitcoin is actually in, rather than as a guaranteed gamechanger only subject to destruction by angry governments or technical flaws.

it is one of many lessons i've taken to heart in my time posting here. other ones include "lol you paid $1000 actual dollars for a bitcoin." and "ron paul!" and "watch this youtube video of crazy people babbling about god i don't know i didn't watch it and you should all be ashamed of yourselves."

There is very little media attention in bitcoin. There is very little network effect outside of the early adopters who want to pump their stash. Most of the "OMG bitcoin" business posts are people spamming here because they know you retards will fall for anything.

oh gosh, wasn't expecting these responses.
- if you can't figure out how to transfer cash you are actually retarded.
- cash doesn't need to be backed up, can be physically secured, and insured in case of theft. bitcoins can also be seized or stolen. welcome to sitting in jail for contempt.
- this is so dumb that you obviously have no idea what you are talking about outside of what you've read on omg bitcoin/omg gold/omg ron paul sources.it literally doesn't matter because inflation is still low, moderate inflation is a good thing, and the US dollar is a global reserve currency. 
but hey, who cares (here.)
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:00:58
People get their bitcoins stolen all the time. Someone just ran off with 90,000 of them. 
Of course it is irrelevant because your selective quoting left out the only relevant part, which is that you will be reimbursed for unauthorized purchase made with your credit card. This even applies to most credit card branded debit cards. And your bank accounts. 
Once someone jacks your bitcoins because you accidentally used the currency of the Internet on something other than a Linux live cd on a computer that has never been online, weeeeelllllllll. Or if another exchange "gets hacked" wellllllll. Or vanishes. Welllllllll. 
You're fucked.

This was the funniest post of all time, with the recent ATM fiasco being a close runner up.

sure, i'm not sure what exactly you want clarified, but the general opinion that i've seen on hitting the block size/transaction limit and checking the growth of the blockchain itself, is to push more things to off chain transactions. as an example, a payment processor handling transactions, and then batching them onto the blockchain, much like the current set up with credit cards and merchant accounts works.

if you regged your account today, or regged your account 1 month and X days ago, and your post is commented mostly by people who also strangely regged their account 1 month and X days ago...bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt. you just need to tag them so three months from now when they pull them back out you can enjoy a laugh instead of a sad frontpage where idiots respond to them like they are people.

I mean, I guess that is a possibility, but every layer of abstraction to make bitcoin function more like normal money is just another reason you might as well just use normal money. There is also the possibility that certain companies dominate the field to such an extent that there really isn't another real choice if you want to have a large pool of people to transact with. The cursed network effect, back to bite bitcoin in the ass. This is already the case with much of the internet due to corporate consolidation, sadly.
I do laugh a little when I see off-chain transactions pitched as the solution to the hilariously low transaction rate limit, for similar reasons. It is the worst possible solution if preserving any of the current bitcoin propaganda reasons for existing are actually a priority over "I'm an early adopter and will be rich someday."

Other old fashioned advice is don't invest in a speculative bubble with people who bought in at a thousandth of what you did and own enough to manipulate prices. 
Also don't give thousands of dollars to shady unregulated off shore exchanges. 
How about don't invest in something that's being hyped by hundreds of fake posts. 
Any way, have a nice day.

it is really fucking with me that the most reasonable person i've argued with about bitcoins is an adult baby.
you separate tone from content, don't get mad at the internet, and though i disagree with a lot of your viewpoint regarding bitcoin investing, you actually acknowledge dissent and state your case in light of the rest of the conversation.
and really i don't even disagree with most of your last comment.
there you have it your best pro-bitcoin poster (child) (sorry, couldn't help myself).

the guy i was replying to thinks apple is blocking bitcoin transactions to protect the world from the NSA, so it is important to note that he is an actual retarded person.

It's not a gem, it's one of a thousand hokey fake posts from hour old accounts pumping you up for another fleecing. It's weird that there were so few of them yesterday. Hmmmmmmm

Hey guys I see that several posts about memes got upvoted so I'm trying to cash in.

I'm here because I'm interested in the bitcoin community. That doesn't necessitate being pro-bitcoin.
I understand the "point" of bitcoin. The community that has sprung up around it has doomed it, unfortunately. I think it is likely that at some point a similar idea could catch on and go mainstream. I do not think it will be bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:46:23
honestly the only thing keeping me from enjoying bitcoin as much as the goldbugs is that there's no chance someone is going to blog about living in a van trying to pan for bitcoins in a dry riverbed.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:30:52
you have paid actual money for MLM scams, though, so you are sort of an outlier on the scale of "most humans".
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:33:18
i don't know how to break this to you, but most people think bitcoins are a ridiculous scam, and don't want to be associated with the type of people who are into bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:17:54
Or you could realize that there is no rational market analysis possible in a hype driven speculative unregulated market and invest in something else.

Hi I'm psychic. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:58:24
psychic hotlines, dot bomb, real estate bubblers, MLM goofballs, social media scammers, latecomer goldbugs, sovereign citizens, doomsday retards...i've been called a "hater" and "jealous" by all of them, as a few people who cashed in early scammed the latecomers as marks.
there is some small chance that bitcoin will be a thing ten years from now. that doesn't change the sane person calculus when you look at the reality of the current situation.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:45:42
I have to assume at this point that you're being intentionally disingenuous, so let's just call it even.

Because your brain just learns to filter out spam, which is what all of those posts are.

I have upvoted one of your comments before. Now I have upvoted two of them, which means you are in my debt. I eagerly await our next encounter! 
I'm tempted to upvote another one just to increase my vote position, but I value free and fair elections.

So we've got a shadowy anarchist who wants to wreck the financial system, the FBI/hitman hiring drug lair operator, a pump and dump shill, a liar, another pump and dump shill, another ridiculous shill, the guys who sued Facebook, and the guy who moderates the two largest sources of bitcoin news and invests in a ponzi scheme run off his forum, that he admitted he thought was a ponzi scheme and still invested in.
The bulk of the economy is run through regularly vanishing unregulated exchanges that you can't get your money back out of. The crown jewel of VC backed bitcoin legitimacy has its own subreddit full of people who haven't heard from support in a month, while the cofounder responds to posts mentioning his name in five minutes.
The exchanges are a low volume game of ping pong between walls erected by big holders siphoning off coins from the orchestrated pump and dumps taking place in the news sources. 
There is basically nothing about bitcoin that isn't shady as fuck, other than it is an interesting idea. 
edit: let's not forget the totes honest industry that has sprung up to support the miners, the backbone of the entire network.

i realize that in this psych ward, that basically makes me alan greenspan, demon of the green monster, but fuck it.
also, before you question my investment strategies, it is important to note that you like MLM.

no. mostly subcultures where there is a monetary reward with sharks and rubes. MLM doofuses, real estate bubblers, paranormal (like Sheldon Nidle), goldbugs, doomsday weirdos and the industry that is leeching off them, social media marketers and the kingpins that suck them dry.
and bitcoins, obviously.

Oh no.  Retarded person thinks I'm a troll. Eventually you may be able to look past my entertaining banter and delve into the overall content of my posts and realize the error of your ways.

In the non-holiday shopping season, Bitpay was only doing around 600 transactions a day. Nobody really spends bitcoins. It's ok to admit it and say that maybe it will change, but right now it is true. 
Most of the transaction volume is gambling, and the exchanges are just people pooping back and forth, forever. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:25:59
It doesn't require routing hardware upgrades, but it does require the majority of the mining pool to sign on, and can't impact existing wallet holders. Those are fairly tight constraints. Less so in an early adopter environment, but on the scale of the Internet?
Ignoring infrastructure level shit, I don't know your background, but the ghosts of the browser wars are just now starting to fade, in large part because google finally said fuck IE 6. Google becoming a large enough player to swing that stick has not really been a good thing for the Wild West of internets past. Who is going to do that in the bitcoin world? If some entity has that sort of influence, would you consider that a good thing?
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:22:49
if he doesn't have a bank account and only uses alt coins as checking, he will starve to death before payment processors come along.

Nobody has ever posted this before. Also they don't take bitcoins because they want actual money. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:26:19
i'd like to point out that these "don't worry it will always go up!" posts with delusional reasoning are the same things that were being told to people at $1200. if you bring that up now, most of the replies are "well everyone knew buying at $1200 was stupid."
you'd be wise to consider that when nearly every opinion given to you is essentially identical, that there may be an agenda.
