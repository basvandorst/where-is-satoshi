No need to bet a ball on that :P    
But I think your theory about Jeff Bezos is flawed because of the fact that **Amazon does not accept Bitcoin as a currency for buying their goods**      
The dude is in charge of the biggest "Online Store" in the world, tries to create the basis for the first "Online currency", but somehow does not understand how to.... link those two ?    
C'mon :)    
EDIT: Someone already mentioned It earlier in the thread but you didn't think any of It -&gt; I double down on my statement.   
Also (not in any way related to you) -&gt; fuck Jeff Bezos and his comments about banking in space... that asshole made a fortune on good ol' fashion capitalist fuckeries. Exploiting everything and everyone here on earth.    
I don't want him on the moon with me.

You live in a society of men, not in a zoo my friend : If you have a beef with the way your country's democracy deal with taxes, you should focus your civic duties around this issue.    
This is really annoying to see my country (France) used in your Medium paragraph -&gt; I'm happy to pay taxes here, in order to keep this social construct we built at the end of WW2.    
But I'm not happy with the way It is spent today, in fact I think that some people should pay WAY MORE taxes, and that's why I aim my vote to reform the system and make 18 slots for taxation, instead of those 5 ridiculous slots we have now...    
S'il te plait ne me dit pas que tu es français et en train de baver ton agenda anarchico-liberal sur un subreddit lié à la crypto. Ce serait lamentable...
