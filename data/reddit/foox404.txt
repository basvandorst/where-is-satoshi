Yeah thanks it makes sense, but still I can see how someone can claim that as he already payed a high onchain fee he would ask a slightly higher price for funds that are already on LN. Another argument is privacy, can we assume funds that are already in LN are more private and thus can be sold for higher price? (also by assuming there's an increased demand for privacy for some reason)

Does this apply to sending from Segwit address to Segwit address only? or this is the case for legacy to Segwit and vise versa also?

Imo people are very aware of how bitcoins can be easily lost /stolen and must be protected. The same arguments for lightning can be applied to any mobile onchain wallet.
I never heard any one recommends to keep large amounts on hot wallets.
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:40:03
Haha thanks.
By the way I use 'Bitcoin lightning wallet' and 'blue wallet' to receive funds. Eclair is the best IMO but currently wo receive option.

I think it will be always a good advise to not put in LN more than you can afford to lose, just like putting cash in your wallet/pocket. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 12:52:55
You can't tell what would have happened if you invested, you could lose your money and to have less than you have now in cash.
Sure you lost to inflation, but it doesn't mean you could do better with other investments.
Be careful and don't daytrade.

I did this to my friends/co workers back in 2013. out of \~10 only 1 still keeps the paper wallet.
everyone else lost them.
\-put it in the car then sold the car.
\-doesn't find it
\-put it on an app then lost the phone/deleted it...
I guess I'm just bad at investing in the right people.

Probably true.
I don't know if the majority are newbs, but every one was a newbie once.
This is something one should learn. I don't think it is more complicated than opening a bank account.

It's the longest proven mobile wallet for Android. 
And the only one that supports hardware wallet on mobile.
Samurai is also great.
In addition I would recommend eclair and start using lightning.

What a huge advance in news coverage,
few years ago you would pull you hair off hearing how bad their explanations were, even those that were positive were just so inaccurate, now you see them make great coverage of bitcoin.
great video.
@_date: 2017-05-15 11:24:24
I guess they mean they are not going to sell them for dollars,
you'll be able to just use them to buy/pay in bitcoins directly.

Sorry for being one of those users who gave one star, I use mycelium since the beginning and the promises you gave for update were never met, I was frustrated.

Hi, thank you for responding to many of the user concerns so quickly.
I would suggest you'll look at "keepass2Android" app.
I can't explain why but I keep donating this app over and over,
will be glad to donate to you too or buy a pro version.
