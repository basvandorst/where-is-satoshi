I‘m so sorry, maybe it is because english is not my native language, but I really don‘t understand what your final point is? Like what do you want from me? An answer? Or a statement? I‘m sorry, I really don‘t get it.

Is this a statement or a question. If this is a statement, why? Nobody can predict future crypto-prices, not even the holy Satoshi. 
If it‘s a question, well it could hit everything between 0$-10^24$.
In the end you could say, what an unnecessary post. But hey that‘s alright. 
Have a nice one.

Uhm what?? I mean your comment is even weirder than the actual post...haha

Wow now there are two possibilities, either you need to get professional help, or you have a brilliant humor.

At the moment I’m in Japan travelling, and at Shibuya-crossing I saw that gigantic Bitcoin ad. And I was just astonished. Wanted to share it with you. Have a nice day.

I really prefer not to debate about politics in this subreddit. Especially, if they’re not the politics in my country. And your opinion on certain politicians are very clear, I won‘t interfere in your freedom of speech. But that’s a subreddit for crypto, not for politics.

The post is not only meant for btc. But for the whole ecosystem. And you can‘t forget that thanks to btc crypto hit the mainstream and was suddenly relevant to everybody. Thanks to btc and the idea of blockchain, many other great currencies could be created.

I personally think it doesn‘t matter how old I am or how old you are. I just wanted to raise people’s awareness to the fact that tech adoption need time. And I don‘t really see the purpose behind your comment to be honest.

You are totally denying the fact that behind cryptos aren‘t just the founders and the early investors that just invested, because of money. But the whole technology. And that‘s what‘s so great about cryptos. There are coins that are trying to solve global financial problems.
I‘m not saying that it‘s not about miney but it‘s also about technology behint it.

Aren't FUD spreaders also kind of some conspiracy theorists? 
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:15:55
FUD of its finest. What a laughable article.

I think it is possible, even without any further identification

So I‘m from Zurich, Switzerland. In the city of Zurich we have about 6 BTC ATM‘s. The process of buying BTC from an ATM is: You get a paper wallet from the ATM with a public, and a private key. Then you insert money, usually CHF or EUR. The amount of money you insert will be directly converted to BTC. If you inserted the amount you want, you finish, and get a kind of receipt. Then you wait about half an hour, can be varying. And you can withdraw the BTC from the paper wallet, to a other wallet of your choice. 
The main distributor of BTC ATM‘s in Switzerland are Värdex, Bitcoin Suisse and the national Railway (SBB)
The limits per Paper wallet are about 2000 CHF (so about 2300 USD) 
but if ypu want to purchase more you just get more paper wallets from the ATM
If you are situated in Zurich or interested in more advice just DM me I can tell you more about it. 
Greetings from Switzerland

Zug is a cryptoequivalent to the silicon valley. Many crypto start-ups are located there. As well as Mining facilities. Because of the low taxes.
