This is a joke. Noone can ever have 21M bitcoins. Thats all that can be mined and many are already lost.

I think your missing one of the points of bitcoin. It IS inherently limited. Only so many can ever exist. Any change to that would be a fork that would no longer be bitcoin. All your arguing about strawmen and insulting people and it turns out you just didn't know the basics.

I've been interested in and messed around with bitcoin for years. I've been casually reading several different subs. Getting to understand the principles behind the blockchain and have found it amazing.... 
Along comes this post. It's comments are scary as fuck. This is like sobering up in the middle of a party and realizing that the people to your left are wearing KKK hoods, the people to your right are playing russian roulette for a cash prize, and a lot of the people in front of you are grown ass adults in diapers. Sure there are a few good people at the party, but I'm really questioning how the hell I got here and if I should go home.

Doesn’t usage determine the consensus? I thought the hash rate is auto compensating.

All currencies are based on confidence. What are you on about?

I poked around the site for a few minutes but couldn't figure out their biz model. How do they profit?
