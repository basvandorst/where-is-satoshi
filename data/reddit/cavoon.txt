Sorry for no response until now. I did send them back. Wallet used is blockchain. Thanks for all the answers

Hello, 
Just select tools, then "Repair wallet" and click "Next"
 
Wait until the process is done, and it hopefully should be fixed.

A friend of mine bought when it was like 935$ last month, now he made double, lol, and he still isn't selling... He is hoping it drops again so he can get some more :) I'd just wait and see if it drops. Seems too high to buy right now...

Idea 2 sounds fun :D
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:03:18
Lets hope it drops, so we all can buy again. :D It'll go up again!

Option 1 like me and everyone else
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:39:16
Yeah. Haha. Right so far what I heard, I'm going to hold. But I am still not sure if I 100% want to do that.

Bitcoin will reach 718390$

Not quite.

I paid a 331sat/B and it only took around 30 mins to get confirmed! (17$ fee.)
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:22:19
Yeah? Well not for everyone. :D But compared to what it might end up at, definitely.

I have mine in breadwallet. That must surely be secure enough

Occasionally MultiBit HD may seem to be stuck. You may have transactions that don't appear to confirm (even though you can see that they've confirmed by checking on Blockchain.info), or MultiBit HD may say it is synchronising for a long time. You can use "Repair wallet" to reset your block chain and get unstuck.
From the Tools select "Repair wallet" and select "Next"
The repair wallet process gives MultiBit HD the opportunity to revisit old transactions, and check if a transaction has fully confirmed. If the transaction has confirmed, then it will appear in your transaction list.

Maybe cash out %20 so no matter what, you would have made profit.
