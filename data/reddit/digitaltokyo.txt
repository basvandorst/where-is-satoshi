Yeah they don't have to care, they will just see the easy to use product, showing just their local currency. People won't know they are using Bitcoin. Unless of course they go into "advanced options" or "advanced withdraw" tabs in the app or something like that.

**Bitcoin will hit mainstream when people don't know they are using bitcoin.**  
  
Regular people don't care about terms like "crypto", "fiat", "decentralized" or even consider what money really is. They care about ease of use, speed and above all fees. It will come in the form of a streamlined app, or streamlined bitcoin integration into something that already has a ton of users. The amounts on a payment app will show your balance in USD or your native currency. On a sidechain it will run, maybe settle its accounts to the main chain every 6 hours or something like that (many of ways to do it). The fees being lower then paypal, western union, moneygram, bank transfer... is the  selling point to getting people into it. Getting bitcoin slicked down in an easy to use Venmo-like app is the key, not the standard libertarian stuff people try to use to get people into it. Make your account linkable to a card so you can use it on basically any Point of Sale device (aka cash register/credit card scanner).
  
**Bitcoin will become like email, you can run your own server and get down to the low level stuff and do everything yourself, or like most people... you will use a service that makes it easier.** With bitcoin it could be similar... I can use a service day to day for ease of use but I can also withdraw some bitcoin to my own personal (and more complicated) wallet if I want for more in depth use.  
  
People started using email over mail as it was faster and cheaper... not because of some tirade against government. (Sidenote: I understand someone with similar beliefs may have helped email grow... it is not the kind of person who made it mainstream) And while that is not the most perfect analogy... I am just saying you are gonna win over people more by a simple "it's cheaper then paypal, faster then a bank" then a "Inflation is theft... use of force... thrown in a cage... slavery..." stuff I thankfully see a lot less of now then I used to.  
  
None of that is to say some of those libertarian points are not valid... People just don't want to hear it. They are skeptical of Bitcoin enough (as it is a new concept in money) that when someone presents them with these worldview shattering libertarian lines on top of that... it freaks them out, they think you are crazy, and they shut down. **Bitcoin is hard enough to swallow for the average person...** instead of throwing both a new currency and these new concepts at them at the same time why not just talk about low fees and speed. And if there is an app making all this streamlined... they can jump right into it without staring at long address, QR codes and terms like multisig. Then somewhere down the line talk about the libertarian stuff.
Integrate bitcoin into an app that shows a person's native currency. Settle BTC in background or in sidechain. Send money like paypal. Still be able to withdraw in BTC address if you so wish to manage your own funds. Push low fees and speed. Keep more "extreme" world views at bay until after its taken off and is used by millions to pay bills, tips, friends, family...

The don't have enough users. More likely it will be some popular site or app that already has huge amounts of users... to integrate it and market it in the right way. Circle doesn't seem to be marketed very well IMO.

So the idea is that if normal mempool goes anywhere from 10k-100k coins on an average day. So when the attack was happening it then goes to 700k coins... it is not too much of a leap of faith to consider ~600k coins to have been part of the hack aka stolen. That example only works if they were NOT chained together or sent to one address after the other. If they were chained together it could mean one lot of 100K coins was moved 6 times making the mempool 600k, or 50k coins moved 12 times, or 25k coins moved 24 times, ect...
  
Someone please correct me if I am wrong.  
  
Edit: Estimates right now seem to say anywhere from 125k-155k coins taken.

You could do it off chain without any kind of consensus... but would have to go back to 8 decimal points when brought back on chain. Would be useful for extreme micro-payments possibly or some "pay-per-click" services where you load up like $2 worth of BTC to your offchain account and its enough to last you like 6 months of surfing on some site (porn, news, pay to download sites...)

Look the absence of knowing the right answer does not mean I jump on board with a 2000 year old book. There is a scale of reasonable beliefs when faced with nearly unanswerable questions.  
  
I don't know&gt;&gt;&gt;Happened by chance&gt;&gt;&gt;universe has always been&gt;&gt;&gt; and then WAAAAAAAYYYY over here is a jump to "guy in the sky sent down his son to earth 2000 years ago"  
  
To say a belief in at least a christian god is reasonable is just not sound reasoning. It is OK not to know all the answers, but it doesn't make your belief on level with someone who has a more... let's say "thought  out" answer, even if both of you can never really know.

Clones are not forks. Clones have their own independent blockchains from the start, while forks use a preexisting chain to start with.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:13:04
Litecoin is a clone not a fork. Meaning litecoin has had its own chain since it's genesis block (aka when it was started). A fork of a coin uses the coin chain that was already there and splits it, meaning the new fork contain the same history as the old one (original) has at the time of the forks creation, and then diverges from there.

Trickle Down Economics is a fun notion at best, it has not worked out so far in regards to wealth inequality. Sure some companies are giving bonus to employees, that is good, but they are a small % compared to the ones who are just going to pocket the money. It is just a highly inefficient way to do things, and although I don't know the right solution for where the US is right now, I feel there has got to be a better way the same thing they have been trying since the 1980's.  
  
On a side note I do know that some of the companies will reinvest in their company, and that can be great. But if I own a business, I don't suddenly need more employees or to give my current employees more money just because I got a cash break. It is a nice thought, but it just doesn't happen in enough cases to be a viable economic solution.

I am sure they do, I am just saying, why would you put money onto coinbase to just sit there rather than in a regular bank account? My point being that most of the wealth on that site is very likely coins, not dollar bills. Coins MOST people in the world have no idea how to secure and leave there, why would you do that to your fiat? It is not the main goal of the site. Sure there are outlier reasons and use cases for something like that to be needed, but they are far from the majority. Also the fiat on Coinbase is FDIC insured up to $250,000 per account, the coins not so much.

Please learn why this metric can be useful, but really is not the best indicator of the strength of the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:32:20
because for someone to distribute the blockchain (all the data of where any particular BTC is at any given time since the beginning of bitcoin), they need to have a computer that can hold it all (currently like 250gb I think), but more importantly, have a connection that can transmit THAT MUCH data nonstop. This person is called a node or a full node. The higher the block size is (currently growing in size 1mb every ~10mins) the faster that builds up, which means it requires more storage and larger internet transfer caps. So right now someone with a $50 harddrive in the US, a decent computer and a decent connection can be a node. The larger the block size in the more it costs to do the same thing. The advantage is that the bitcoin could run more transactions a second with a bigger block size.

"Red Pills".... really? Nobody appreciates that bullshit. 
  
The more ideas and views held by people involved in the bitcoin space the better. Despite an enthusiastic libertarian following from the get go, there are lots of varying ideals held by the community.

Other coins don't need it because a mixture of two things:  
1. They don't have the huge number of transactions that bitcoin has.  
2. They work a different way.
  
Other coins would run into similar bottlenecks if they had BTC transaction volume.  Not sure why there is always so much interest in what Satoshi would have wanted.

Very true but it exists as a real investment to the people who were fooled. Not that there is no personal responsibility, but a main domain bitcoin,com is a disguised and misleading website. People putting too much trust that the first .com they type in is legit, but it is still unheard of to go to Pepsi's website and see them selling a new thing called CokePep to get more investment/sales/interest.

BTC market cap dominance is not a useful metric when anyone can create a coin, a site and a whitepaper out of thin air. You could maybe use BTC dominance to get a feel for the market, but not as the only metric.  
  
Network size, hash power, number of nodes, number of developers, transactions, block size, block speed and even price are solid metrics to use. Even google searches or daily traffic on the bigger coin news outlets, is a better metric.
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:35:55
Agreed. I thank Satoshi for his contributions but outside of "oh that is a cool quote", I don't put much weight into it. Just like I am not super interested in the developers notes of creating email.

Just let them do their own thing, BTC got one chain and BCH has the other. I wish them the best, even though I feel its not going to go so well.  
  
**Having a top 10 coin fail?** Has not really happened before, someone correct me if I am wrong, but it would break peoples trust in crypto or just the idea of a blockchain all together. And I think crash the market.
Weather you care or not the trouble comes is all the angry duped innocent bag holders being wiped out, but more importantly it will take down big exchanges through arbitration, which will bring down the market.

Not a problem. These nodes insure that everyone has access to the full bitcoin record, which in turn makes it heavily resistant to tampering with. The more nodes, the harder it is to attack the network. Also I should clarify: I said that person is a node when in truth it is the computer the person is running is a node. The cheaper we keep the point of entry for helping out the network like this the better. As $50 might be not a big deal to Americans, Japanese, UK, etc. That same $50 could be a weeks wage in another country, which would stop them from setting up their own node that keeps another WHOLE copy of the blockchain on the network. The more it can spread to the four corners of the globe the better.

A bug in the heavily peer-reviewed bitcoin code or MORE likely IMO in a problem in the code of the libraries aka code that is open source and helps underpin how bitcoin works. Kind of like the stuff bitcoin is built upon. For example like the internet you browse is built upon mixtures of HTML, Java, CSS, SSL, ect. If SSL has a bug someone figured out, your encrypted pages such as your bank account, email, youtube account, etc could possibly have trouble being legitimately secure, as aspects of that site were based on the building block of SSL (encryption). Kind of like a recall on one particular part of a car. But honestly this is all stuff that can be rolled back. You would basically have to shut down the internet and electricity permanently. So really you would have more things to worry about then a digital currency as the world would collapse.
  
**Scenarios that would be recoverable but shake trust in Bitcoin:**  
Loss of power in country with large % of mining operations, meaning that for up to 2 weeks bitcoin would be painfully slow until the difficulty readjusts.  
Quantum computers breaking the bitcoin SHA256 encryption. (this would be total clusterfuck for the world not just bitcoin)  
Collapse of several exchanges at once.  
A big gov makes it illegal.  
Changes in US net neutrality laws.

I think coinbase will be more than happy for a BCH crash, due to most people having coins sitting in there than actual cash.

A much better metric of how BTC is doing rather then some arbitrary CMC "BTC Dominance" %.

I think you and I are on the same page of the way its going to go WHEN the tech is there, how quickly we arrive on this tech and what can really be done in the mean time is another story. A lot can happen in 20 years if everyone is already going to centralized corners of the net, people who grew up who can vote that never knew it any different. What happens in that 20 years is going to be a mess. We are going to make lots of mistakes before we make the right call.

Money is boring. This money is a bit less boring due to it still being developed, but it will never get acceptance unless the public see it in a positive light. Do the ends justify the means? Maybe.  
  
I have always found the tech to be fascinating and really what drew me to it in the first place. That I could post a QR code on a site and someone could pay me money for goods or services, from anywhere in the world with no middleman? That has been the internet's achilles heal, no native payment protocol. To get people used to paying on the internet, paypal was created. To get people used to bitcoin you have to make it look legitimate, which unfortunately means we pay attention to GS and ETF news. Searching for legitimacy in the public eye is hard, but you have to play the game or bitcoin will never go anywhere. Having big institutions involved does not mean I want GS to be a success, more of that they are less likely to lobby government to make bitcoin illegal if they have skin in the game. For us supporters it is the long con to money freedom.  
  
It could blow back in our face, maybe banks lobby to make it more complicated to use BTC via laws. They can than make it prohibitively expensive to use BTC or have a trading desk for smaller startups so only the big banks can compete.

I agree. With the value changing in the way it does still, swinging past +-10% in a matter of hours. This seems like a good but very misguided attempt to push this kind of thing.

See if you are coming at this with a libertarian/invisible hand of the market view of the markets, I am not going to be able to sway you. I respectfully disagree about insider trading when the market is still so very small and heavily impacted by a handful of companies, companies that employ people who all want to make $$$. I do not think that a lack of insider trading laws is a good thing.

Well ones like LTC (the most stable of all alts IMO) don't really move too much without some move with BTC as well. So to have them go from 6mbtc to 10 for the last two weeks without a movement by BTC until this morning is interesting.

Of course it is, but USD is one of the most evenly distributed currencies ever. A cup of coffee is not gonna be $3 one day and $4 the next. Everyone agrees on that price cause everyone knows what a dollar is worth. Nobody is sitting on the sidelines with 0.5% of all USD and ready to tank the market. It would take a massively coordinated effort to purposely lower the value of a dollar (unless you are the US gov itself or another gov). None of those things can be said about BTC.  
  
Trust me I want an ETF just as much as you seem too, but I cannot see it being approved until the majority of exchanges are regulated (not really possible but lets pretend) AND the currency being more evenly distributed. The "threat" of Satoshi's coins alone, **5% of all BTC** (which I count as gone at least) is enough for the SEC to reject this. I am not saying all this is valid I am telling you how they think. Even without an attacker having any BTC, the threat of DDOS and hacked hot wallets is far greater than the threat of a USD exchange having money withdrawn (which can be traced much better than BTC and can be "undone"). I am basically saying the ecosystem is not there yet. Just look at the monopoly Coinbase has in the US. There are no insider trader laws with BTC as of yet. I could think of so many scenarios of what could go wrong with an attacker or group not owning a single satoshi. It is not like Coinbase and Bitstamp have the same regulations around it, cash, security and insurance that a US bank like BoA or Citi has, this is **still** the wildwest and will be until more infrastructure is built.  
  
I hope I am wrong as an ETF could be a great thing. Although the one they are trying doesn't even hold BTC at all, it's just pegged to the price. The same type of ETF but for gold did NOT work out so well for the price of gold, so we will see.  
  
EDIT: A Coinbase employee could find out about so many thing and just pass on what is happening or what currency will be added or if they are opening to new markets AND then do completely whatever they want with that info legally. If that doesn't seem like a glaring flaw in the ecosystem right now you need to re-examine it.

I understand what you are saying. But there is no reason that vendors could not use a 3rd service with chargebacks and refunds. A Visa like layer on top. I also really think the internet could use some form of native currency (not parroting the Twitter CEO who said that, I have been saying this for years). Even if bitcoin cannot compete with the likes of Visa or Paypal, at least it will bring some competition and hopefully lower fees across the board.
  
  
Also setting up an address for bitcoin transactions costs nothing to create, while with credit cards you have to go through a 3rd party to be able to use a credit card on the web. And it is usually a monthly charge by this 3rd party company to keep using it's services, while a bitcoin address just sits there forever. This is a big deal for small online shops that don't make many sales, which is fine as it is not always the persons main source of income but a side project. Now you could use one of those premade store templates, but the company that provides them charges you far more in fees than bitcoin would need on a lightning network.
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:55:14
I really don't see how you can approve something for a regulated market (ETFs), when most of the price movement it would be pegged too is from unregulated exchanges all over the world.  
  
Meaning one could LEGALLY manipulate a major exchange and then reap the benefits on their ETF position. It just does not make business sense, as much as I would like to see a BTC ETF happen.

Well I don't think they ever really were selling that. One would need a decentralized twitter to pull that off. But I don't see that being popular anytime soon. Also I don't think people value freedom of speech that much to either switch or be on a platform where a hypothetical hate group can function. So that would be an uphill battle.  
  
As a side thing, I don't use twitter, but it is odd that someone can threaten someone with nukes and not be in violation of Twitters user agreement. But of course if one were to ban a president from twitter, the backlash would be swift. A company like twitter who has never made money if I remember correctly, would not survive. It is also giving them a lot of free press. Now I am not going to sit here and tell you trump is bad, but at least I don't have to worry about Mike Pence doing something stupid out of nowhere. I don't like either of them but one can predict Pence, which is a great thing if that person can turn a city to dust at will.

People use pools that point your GPU toward whatever coin network is most profitable to mine that day and at the end of the day it cashes out BTC.  
  
This method is more profitable than GPU mining BTC, but so is doing nothing. This at least get people with access to GPUs some spare change as apposed to blockchain dust.

I understand why Gavin has gotten out of the spotlight. While I wish he would come back into the spotlight as if you look at how he interacted with the press, we really had nobody like him and still nobody has replaced him as being a frontman. But I understand his mistake, but in no way does that overshadow the work he has done for bitcoin. Only a handful of people can claim to have had that much of an impact on bitcoin and the direction it took.

@_date: 2018-05-23 15:41:14
As cool as it would be to have every transaction on the main chain until the end of time, I have never really thought it was practical at all. Having a BTC balance on that newspapers site, a 3rd party wallet balance that settles with the paper once a month, atomic swaps or when the LN is out of beta... are away better ideas for micro transactions than using the main chain which is limited for a reason. I think trying to put everything on the main chain is misguided approach for ANY currency out there that works in a similar way to bitcoin. But I am happy to be proven wrong when another currency chain gets as much traffic as bitcoin and finds a way to not make their chain grow exponentially in size in a short period.

Not all of us here are interested in making fiat obsolete. if that is a side effect that is neat but not really what I like about bitcoin. The tech is immensely interesting and its nice to be able to send money like an email without a centralized service. The web has always been missing a fully digital way to pay for something natively from the start. It was always meant to be in there. Then you go from there and talk about smart contracts and many other things that the worlds longest and most reinforced blockchain can be used for. There are so many reasons to be INTO bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-10 22:30:15
Questioning fiat is something I think we are all doing regardless of political leanings (at least in crypto space). I would not come to the same conclusions as Ron Paul. Which is fine, he has my respect and looks like a nice guy. Never really was down with the entire libertarian mindset, but they do make some interesting points that do make you think a bit, even if you don't come to their same conclusions.

@_date: 2014-04-07 18:03:13
Trying to follow the logic of people responding to this post...  
  
So if using bitcoin is a libertarian thing... does that also mean that email, VoIP, internet radio, FTP, p2p, IRC, ect... are all libertarian? Even though a huge number of people use these protocols/advancements that are not libertarians?  
  
So does that make someone using a credit/debit card or cash a statist/socialist/liberal/conservative/[insert world view here]?  
  
Not being sarcastic, really just trying to figure this out as everyone who uses email may infact be using something that aligns with libertarian ideas... but that in no way makes them libertarian.
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:35:46
Yeah but what was the vision of email? or TCP/IP or HTTP? You really think they had streaming live video in mind when that all came out? Or that people would play chess over email? Or that the guy who created Napster had torrents in mind when he popularized p2p?  
  
Then again while I would take Satoshi's words into consideration, it really isn't their project anymore now is it? I mean you think Satoshi is sitting on their computer in Nov 2008 being like "Someday this will protocol type will be used to make a game called CryptoKitties and a DNS replacement"
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:15:44
Hey thanks for the thoughtful response. I totally agree with you on all those points. I really feel this will be a blip in the history of bitcoin and really working together creates great things. Just look at what Litecoin did, it was basically BTC code, they implemented Segwit way before BTC did. That is so helpful to have a real world test bed with similar code and a smaller more homogeneous community like LTC has made it possible to push it through quickly. People seem to forget that LTC is the 2nd longest chain by a handful of years (behind both BCH/BTC) and gives really the only real world test bed for what BTC/BCH might want to accomplish.  
  
On a last note, if anyone thinks that cryptos are just about money, the stuff I foresee coming out of layer 2 or even layer 3 solutions... Just the possibilities are so vast. Just to have a censorship resistant way to add something that cannot be changed. One can post a message or patent something or just used as a proof of "I was there". We have not had that in history before, it has always been stone tablets, scrolls, books, digital files... all of which can be destroyed and altered. But barring any future problems with either coin... your message is stuck there forever and backed up by thousands of nodes around the world. That alone gives me chills when I think about the implications. Once you link all the chains, there is still going to be a dominate one that is the most trusted out there, from deeds to a house to smart contracts to just 21st century graffiti on the blockchain.  
I may have gone off topic a bit but I could be here for days talking about it. This is one of the most exciting things to happen to tech since the internet in my opinion and we are just scratching the surface.

**Referring to these tweets (thank you u/Priest_of_Satoshi for the link)  **
  
As much as I understand that not all death threats are straight to the point, he is raising very valid concerns. That is why having a figurehead is dangerous. The killing of Vitalik would have a massive effect on ETH price. I don't think you can argue otherwise.
Now I don't know this guys background, so maybe I am missing something. But there is a reason Satoshi is gone, and he needs to stay gone. Satoshi coming back would have a huge negative impact on price and more importantly the security of the chain.
Now if a primary bitcoin developer died or was killed, the price would not be that effected. That is why having no central face is important. Yes we have big figures, but they are not royalty and it ebbs and flows. For example we haven't heard much from Gavin since the Craig Wright hoax. He used to be all in the news and appearing on TV shows. Now I haven't heard his name mentioned in some time. I always liked him but I understand why he retreated after that bad judgement call. Roger Ver used to be "Bitcoin Jesus", lately not so much. Same thing with Hern.

I really don't feel it makes sense to have every tip or cup of coffee to be on the blockchain forever, it is a nice thought but one that I believe is flawed (at least with a first gen coin like bitcoin). I am glad the two groups went their separate ways. I was actually in favor of a 2mb blocksize move WITH segwit, to move that debate forward, but I could also plainly see that this rift of "All on the base layer" and "All settled on the base layer" was going to cause a split either way at some point, easier to do it early than when cryptocurrencies  becomes a major force someday. We both got our own way and I wish the BCH community the best. Would also like to apologize for this subs behavior, everyone here is 5 years old and foaming at the mouth when someone makes a BCH meme.  
  
You don't have to reply to me why BCH or BTC is bad or how evil Roger/Core is. I read all the papers, I watched the interviews. I made up my own mind about it but just because I sided more with the segwit option doesn't mean I am going to be a total dick. Yes the whole "who has bitcoins name" thing is shady as hell but like there are actual people who bring up good reasons for keeping all things directly on chain, and although they were not enough to sway me, I am not going to be a jerk about it. Be nice reddit.  
  
As an aside, I do believe that side chains will become very important in the future. And with atomic swaps and the like going forward it will be interesting to see the value of currently non-dominate chains increase because of such tech going forward. There doesn't seem to be much reason that both coins cannot talk to each other. Someone correct me if I am missing something or if I have atomic swaps all wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:45:10
Better yet, and my answer to anyone who brings up BTC fluctuations... If bitcoin goes to $50k, a drop of $500 is not going to really effect your $50 purchase heavily. The higher BTC gets the smaller % change a $500 drop becomes, making most everyday purchases way less volatile in comparison than they are now.
@_date: 2018-05-20 12:45:34
Yes it is rather odd sometimes. Being into the tech and the way it works has always been fascinating to me. Sort of like when I use youtube or email, I am not trying to bring down TV or the postal system. Just using something that is efficient and instant (at least from the user perspective). Now yes money has a bigger impact on society than TV or the postal system, I get that. But I have always been heavily frustrated with how hard or expensive it is to send money or set up a store online. With bitcoin you can set up a site with one image of what you are selling and a QR code for payment, and to me that is amazing. Would it be that amazing if banks had set up a really cheap easy payment system that works cross borders? No, it would not. But due to lack to competition, they have not. So either I use bitcoin, or it brings down fees enough enough through competition to make BankCoin a viable option.  
  
I am also a big fan of the deflation nature of bitcoin, which I don't think a Bankcoin or UScoin will ever have. Saving money is important and the fact that it is so hard to do so with inflation is wrong.  
  
I have learned a lot about the libertarian mindset by being into bitcoin, even if I don't always come to their same conclusions, they raise a lot of good questions that really make you think. I also think its important to listen to nuanced views as much as possible.  
  
I don't use twitter, but you are right about it being hard to follow news/blogs about bitcoin and not get a heavy libertarian bent that shows up in other non-crypto news.  
  
Any replies are appreciated. The more views I hear the better, I truly believe that.

Now if we can just get USA arcades to stop being basically gambling parlors for children, currently its just kids playing usually unfun games for a chance to win lots of tickets to get crappy prizes they could have bought for 1/5 of the price they spent. I mean if you have to go the ticket route, would it really be so hard for a company like Namco or Capcom to make lots of multi-cabinets of old arcade games that dispense tickets based on your score in Pacman or Ghosts'n Goblins? Take the final score and multiply it by some algorithm to get the tickets to come out. Because 255,000 in Pacman is not the same as 225,000 in Ghosts'n Goblins. [/rant]

I honestly don't think a currency on the main chain is really a decent idea (for the way bitcoin works atleast, being a first gen coin and everything). Yes it's nice to buy a coffee, but do you really need your morning coffee on the worlds longest running blockchain forever? I am not saying it can't be done, but it seems silly to me. Other chains don't really have the # of transactions or volume bitcoin currently has. So any proven real world scaling test of another coin has not really been done. Now bitcoin could be very well knocked off it's throne, but it is still awhile off. Right now transactions are cheap again on the main chain and they are just going to get cheaper as Lightning is deployed.

I agree that the future is services like email became. But the best thing with email is that you STILL could run your own email server if you wanted or choose the easy gmail/yahoo/hotmail option.  
  
So even if there is a Google BitWallet or Microsoft BitLook... I can still send bitcoin manually to those people who use the dumbed down version. Just like before email you pretty much had to use USPS (in the US) to send letters to people, email gave the people the option to send their own messages for free on their terms... but you can still send a letter just fine though. Before bitcoin my options for buying stuff or receiving money online were really credit cards or bank transfers... or worse... checks/money orders in the mail!  
  
I hope that kind of made sense!

I have had several blockschains on SSD drives for dedicated nodes and everything runs much smoother. But the majority of people I see using SSDs use them for their OS and a few important programs and then a regular HDD for extra programs and storage. And the QT-Wallet by default wants to store it on your main drive, which is a waste of space if your main is an SSD. You could change its directory before by making a shortcut to QT and editing its values but this looks much easier, which is why I brought it up. :)  
  
On a side note, I have used SSDs for about 4 years now and even the first one I bought is still running great after lots of OSs installs over the years and now used as a dedicated scratch disk for video editing and caching. I think a lot of the SSD wearing down stuff is a bit overblown IMHO.

While I agree with that we should make it way more inclusive and I think that having more women involved in bitcoin (or any other tech sector, government, industry) would be great... but I always run up against what to say instead of "hey guys!" just in general life. To me I say "hey guys" regardless of gender. I mean sure I could say "Hey people" but it just seems so forced. Not to mention my liberal use of "man" at the end of a sentence.  
  
Regardless I don't really say "Hey guys" or "man" in threads as it seems rather silly without the right vocal inflections.

So I am guessing if you had a fresh install of linux mint, only hooked it up to the internet to download the blockchain and one non-logged-in visit to a linux forum and only have it connected to the internet to sync the blockchain every fews months there is nothing to worry about? and that this mostly has to do with exchanges, email and 2FA?

tTreddit and make a post about how "Things are going good on coinbase for me" but the people who have a problem will make "HEY COINBASE! STOP HOLDING MY BTC AND START ANSWER MY EMAILS!"  
  
I really like Coinbase. Never had a problem with them. Beats using Dwolla or Bank Transfers to people on Local Bitcoins anyday. Site is easy to use, fast and layout is clean.
Edit: Also was in no way trying to come off bitchy, and any site can use some improvement.

More so the blockchain concept.  
  
 Also is email getting around the government barriers for sending letters? Or is it just an advancement in sending letters and the archaic need for stamps and paper? Digital money was inevitable IMO. Then there is the fact that even if there was no money laundering laws, KYC and such... a service like paypal would still exist where they would take a cut to transfer my money. Sure probably much less without these laws, but they would still have to pay for servers, staff, ect... The fact that I can be my own digital bank, just like I can be my own email server, webhost, radio host, video streamer, ect. All because of the internet... is what makes me happy and interested. And the deflationary aspect doesn't hurt much either. I also don't totally reject every libertarian stance on the issues either.

@_date: 2014-02-20 01:04:36
I get all those things you said and thanks for that well written response. While I understand that I may be bypassing the governments arbitrary barriers by doing these things, that is not WHY I do them. If the government had lets say let everyone have their own TV station or radio station if they wanted in the 90's (and if they had enough frequencies) I really would have not been as excited about youtube or internet radio. I would have been more then happy to use a real radio station, then later add a net presence for people outside my terrestrial radio broadcast. If the government had made its own frictionless eCash I would use it and be less excited about the currency aspect of bitcoin.  
  
Bitcoin is valuable to a lot of people because of the stuff it does outside of the government, I don't question that. But in the end, going around the government is not why I am excited about bitcoin, it is almost like a side effect to me. It is just not my main interest. I hope that kind of make sense?

Besides the lower fee most excited about:  
- Store key creation time. Calculate whole-wallet birthday.  
- Optimize rescan to skip blocks prior to birthday    
- Add network traffic graph in debug window  
  
Also think this:  
- Allow user to choose data directory on first start, when data directory is
  missing, or when the -choosedatadir option is passed

It was a really great expo. The room was packed at certain points. Even if it was a retreading of some stuff I knew at points I picked up a bunch in areas where I was fuzzy.

Fun calculator I use for ballparks of this stuff.  
  
  
  
Make sure to hit calculate when you are done. Both those AMD cards alone should take about 400 watts, your processor about 100 watts (170 under full load) and the 780 can use up to 250-300 watts under load. This is not including powering the mobo, HDDs and so on. I would get another power supply if I were you or find a cheap one for $30 to just power one of the 270's. Keep in mind a lot of these things are estimates but it's always important to leave some headroom.  
  
Back when I had 4x 7950s and 1 Nvidia GPU I bought two PSUs to power it. One to power 3 of the cards and the other to power the motherboard and the other two. 
A quick google image search will show you how to start a second PSU with just a paperclip.Search "PSU jumper"

Hmmm people always point to evidence that Satoshi was a Libertarian. That's fine if he was... but I kind of don't care. Just like I don't care if the inventor of HTTP, C++, TCP/IP, P2P or email was a Nazi, Socialist, Democrat, Marxist, Cannibal, Communist, or Necrophiliac.... ect

This is what this subreddit was like a mere 6 months ago, a large amount of imgur links on the front page. They went away after it shot up to $1200 for a bit. On the other extreme is the doge subreddit... which has one bit of news for every 20 meme posts. Wonder what other coins subs are gonna look like if they ever hit a large USD value. Either way although I find this one fun, I like the front page better without memes personally, as i find 99%+ to be not really funny.

Kind have already thought of this. If the US just makes eDollars work in such a way that you can send money like you can with paypal but with no transaction fees... I think it would see massive usage. Especially if it was backed by the FDIC and such (and then backed by nothing). Although I don't think the credit card lobby would be very happy.  
  
Put aside the stuff a lot of people on this sub care about (privacy, government control, tracking...) and realize most people do not really care enough about that stuff to do something about it. Personally I got into bitcoin because I thought the protocol was interesting and the promise of getting money over the internet from the few sales I do on tech trading forums without having paypal take a decent sized chunk (or the dreaded charge back). The pseudo-annoymus, being my own bank and deflation with bitcoin is just an added bonus in my book.  
  
On a side note I am unsure how they would implement eDollars in the way I was talking about, but if they somehow did, the general population... the same one who does not understand inflation or money printing... would start using it.

I expect every state to do this eventually. Just an advisory is kind of meaningless. But with the ATM in South Station I think it sped it along.

Never been into the tight pant look myself, never did I expect guys pants to go back to tight jeans... much less cigarette jeans. Lack of decent pocket space drives me crazy. Doesn't need to be super cargo/baggy but I think there can be a good compromise in between.  
  
But the hipster look is blurred like crazy now. Seeing jocks/frat guys wearing pink pants, neon colors, oversized digital watches and wool caps would be puzzling as hell if I used a time machine to jump from 2008 to 2014. I mean I am glad that it is socially acceptable for a guy to put a little more thought into his look instead of the standard jeans+shirt+hoodie+Vans combo... but shit its like there are walking human blacklight posters on the subway.

Not takings sides here...but am I the only one thinks there is a 90% chance I am have a discussion with a libertarian when they hear "locked in a cage" or "thrown in a cage". I just never seem to encounter that phrasing for serving a jail term outside of crypto currency websites and libertarian leaning sites.

For people with a lot of bitcoin they want to spend and the place they are at doesn't take bitcoin and he feel like buying gift cards for each spot (if there is even one).

Yeah just sharing my opinion base on what I have read. I don't think the SEC will let the ETF go through for some time. Not for lack of trying on the people at the SEC who want it, but crypto is a completely new asset class that they don't know how to classify just yet. That would be a hurtle enough without all the scams and all the calls of market manipulation in crypto. Bakkt seems more like its actually going to happen.

Sure tax evasion will be a lot easier. Some of us just don't particularly mind paying taxes. Sure it's not an efficient system and it could be better, and some of it goes to things I don't want it to or I am against, but I am... over it I guess?  
  
I also don't realistically see people being their own bank or even wanting to. They should have the option too of course, and that's amazing but I see most people using a front end denominated in USD and FDIC insured (at least in the US). Bitcoin will "go mainstream" when people don't know they are using bitcoin.  
  
It is just like email, the protocol is there so you can set up your own server but the vast majority (it has to be higher then 99%) are more then happy to use an email service maintained by someone else.

Everyone gets into bitcoin for different reasons. I know none of these things factored into my decision to get into it. Yet I still had an "ah-ha!" moment that led me to get involved, and it had almost 100% entirely to do with the tech behind it rather then concern about banking.

**Bitcoin is still in beta.**  
  
v**0**.16.0 is the current version
  
Bitcoin users are still beta testers. So the whole user argument, while neat, doesn't make sense until BTC v1 is released.  
  
Although can a software that is used for billions of $ still be considered beta even though bitcoin technically is? Maybe a new class of software terms need to be introduced?

I totally agree with the idea that automation frees up humans to do more (Luddites and all that). The march of progress is important. I do however think there is a limit to that thinking though. But you can't honestly feel that 100% of the population is going to be able to go from what is around now to a job that requires an above average level of thinking? At some point the human population will be higher then the amount of jobs available.

As much as its fine to put forward your political beliefs whether I agree with them or not... putting your Libertarian foot forward is IMO not the best way to sell anyone on Bitcoin.

Do you not think that with automation the future is already headed towards some kind of universal basic income? There are people who will never be qualified to do anything past manual labor, and those type of jobs keep vanishing. There are already countries testing pilot programs based on a Universal Basic Income. Maybe it won't be the case in the USA, but there are already people planning for such things. And all these things are happening without us having scratched the surface of AI... we are just talking about robot arms and amazon factory floor robots at this point.  
  
Putting the politics of it aside for a moment (if you can), we are already heading toward the uptopia/dystopia of some kind of another of never having to work, with or without cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:36:42
I totally agree that we just can't wait for renewables to catch up, but I can actively see countries proposing using their specific and regional type of renewable energy. For example, a country with a lot of low cost hydro electric power could perhaps actively try to attract mining startups/companies. Although I am not sure how many "jobs" it would create, but it could be something a country does to bolster it importance on the world stage and possibly become a Bitcoin hub. This is of course all speculation... but the fact that even a really slow satellite internet connection is all that is really required to mine gives me hopes that someone will buy a remote and cheap swath of land themselves, and in effect cut out the costs of energy almost entirely, with the creation of a dam, wind farm, solar or whatever.

@_date: 2017-11-30 16:05:10
**Some of us are here for the interesting tech.**  
  
I think its always important to have different points of view and I think the bitcoin ecosystem is better because of it. But this is not really the best PR for the front page with so many newcomers checking out Bitcoin for the first time. People hear that it "pyramid scheme!" or "ponzi" all the time and coming here to learn more, only to be greeted with this gem of a post, is really not helping.  
By no means am I saying don't express opinions, but jumping on users that are maybe 'okay' paying taxes right away is again, not helpful.
    
**TL;DR**  
If you want to propose libertarian ideas, maybe do it a bit more subtlety, as "over throw the government" is not going to win over anyone.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:18:09
Yeah I don't eat artificial coloring. I am also aware that strawberries are breed and hybridized for desired traits. I am also aware ginger and other things are irradiated. There is a thing called acceptable risks, and changing the DNA by snipping out pieces of a double helix is where I draw the line.  
  
Now just maybe editing out DNA might not be so bad (maybe added vitamins or larger size) if it was not done in a way that made the farmers able to use even harsher chemicals on their plants as they changed it to be resistant to a handful of companies (or just one)'s pesticide.  
  
So let's put aside the eating aspect of all that for a moment. Runoff and ground water seepage can be a major problem in and of itself. If I need to say why that is bad then I don't know what to tell you. A similar thing happened when they were making corn into fuel and they thought "hey nobody is going to be eating this, so let's up the amount of stuff we put on it to increase yield." and it all soaked into the ground.
  
And of course organic farming uses pesticides, you gotta keep off the bugs. But pesticides used by organic farmers are of a different class (nor are as effective) as the ones used by conventional US farming.  
  
I also think you misunderstand the idea conveyed when someone tries to eat "natural". Mercury is natural, so is Arsenic. The word "natural" is co-oped to mean something to the effect of "foods/ingredients found in nature that humans can eat", not that everything natural is healthy. You can really destroy your body on a diet of even harmless foods.

Yes yes nothing just ever happens. A lot of people are it this for earnings and it's near a physiological barrier. Of course people are gonna get out. How long do you think most people are gonna hold past $1million?  
  
Also people seem to forget that a bug in the code of Bitcoin could send the price crashing and have the need for an immediate hard fork (which has happened). And let's not even look at Bitcoin code but the libraries and other code it relies on. Yes sure they will be able to roll it back but in the meantime it would be a freefall.

Really its just more profitable per hashs/sec to mine BCH right now due to the jump in price. If they can make more $/hour then its the obvious move, not many other coins use SHA256 algorithm for their PoW coin. It's really not hard to figure out.

Yes this is the problem I see happening. Exchanges are unregulated and they are using those prices to get a number for a regulated investment. Now if they were holding BTC then I would not be so concerned. But it doesn't take much cash (in wall street terms) to really aggressively push the market one way on these exchanges. 
  
Is that not one of the main reasons that the SEC denied the Bitcoin ETF last spring?  
  
Again I really hope this works out, just looking for answers to these things. Thanks for taking the time to answer.

Not sitting here saying "this time is different" but the time scale matters IMO for this.  
 
And putting aside just how a HUGE % of people had their money on one exchange across the world in 2013. While today it's spread with, what 20 different exchanges? A single point of failure is no longer the case (at least exchange wise). Now I agree there will be some kind of correction, but the ecosystem seems more mature/legit at this point then it did in 2013? Correct me if I am wrong, as I am not always right.

Well the fact that Intel is struggling to make chips that are 7nm, because it is is getting to the point where the transistors are too close together and bleed electrons over to their neighbors (because physics), it is hard to imagine the semi-professional (if you can even call them that) mining equipment manufacturers are going to have an easy time continually making faster and faster chips. But the way I see it both or one of two things is going to happen:
  
A. Be produced by a "real" company with the fabrication plants to handle the level of tech going into making smaller and smaller chips. Meaning AMD/Intel/Nvidia/IBM/Qualcomm getting in the miner equipment manufacturing business, which is really not that far fetched if Bitcoin continues to grow as it has.
  
  or
  
B. The semi-pro manufacturers hit a wall and focus on improving performance of the chip architecture they already got and/or adding more cores per chip.  
  
So yeah, my hope is that efficiency will help, but also alternative energy sources coming online and almost 100% negating the negative environmental effects. Not to mention all the miners that are already set up near hydro electric dams, solar farms, etc.

**Bitcoin will be big when nobody knows they are using bitcoin.**   
  
**People don't want to rethink money**, nor do they understand how money works and what a fiat currency is. They are not suddenly going to wake up and "get it". Nobody knows how much a candy bar costs in BTC off the top of their head like they do in their local currency, because they didn't grow up using BTC to relate it to prices.  
  
So what do I mean? I mean a streamline app (Venmo clone or other) that uses bitcoin but shows your local currency equivalent to the BTC balance. Streamlined bitcoin integration into something that already has a ton of users would also work. Under the fiat balance it has the BTC value in a smaller font, that way people can learn and get used to what costs what in BTC. But most of the transactions outside of withdrawing funds are done off-chain. Lightning looks like it will bring down fees incredibly as adoption grows. Nobody needs your cup of coffee on the chain forever, most transactions are fine off chain but **you should always have the option to do it manually.** Make your account linkable to a magnetic strip or NFC card so you can use it on basically any Point of Sale device (aka cash register/credit card scanner).

**Because massive increases year over year is a symptom of Bitcoin being a new thing, not because it will be that way forever.** Bitcoin jumping $1000 over a year isn't going to mean much in terms of percentage once bitcoin has found a stable price years and years down the line from now.  
  
$1-&gt;$1000 =1000x jump  
$50,000-&gt;$51,000 = not so much.

Yes but central banks can give out whatever they want, anytime they want or change interest rates anytime, while bitcoin has a set and predictable scheduled for bitcoins mined and added to the network. They also have a stopping point.
  
Side note: Just because BTC exists doesn't mean there won't still be lenders for loans or fiat currency for that matter.

People tend to forget that you can put messages and contracts/deeds on the bitcoin blockchain. It is a great place to put something that can't be changed up on the net, which in and of itself is valuable. Weather that warrants it's current value is up for debate. 
  
I just don't see people bringing those up. Another interesting thing is that the network up time since its inception has been near perfect 99.9% over 10 years (looking for source that I can link to). Would have been 100% had it not been for bugs in the early years. But that has nothing to do with it's speed of transactions.

Thanks for the thought out reply. I disagree that China, Nazi Germany or even Venezuela was ever really 100% socialist. Were/are they all not borderline dictatorships with socialist aspects? That is a real question, open to hearing your thoughts.  
  
Although in all honestly I don't think pure capitalism, socialism or communism will ever work, it takes mixtures of aspects of all of them to work. And what might work for one nation might not work for another.

I keep saying this. Bitcoin will be successful when the majority of people using it DON'T know they are using it. An app that displays your local currency that on the backend uses bitcoin.  
  
Most people don't want to rethink money, much less know what money really is. They just want cheap payments, and if an app like I talk about can do that, then they will use it. Maybe down the line add little letters below the amount of what the amount being sent is in bitcoin to get them used to seeing that.  
  
Now you might argue that bitcoin is more of a store of value at this point and I don't know if I can argue against that. But some other coin or perhaps the lightning network for bitcoin could be used.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:40:49
Maybe in a decade or two people will get more familiar with values in BTC overtime. But people don't even understand what money is, much less want to rethink their whole life of cues about costs of things in their day to day life. In time maybe, but I don't see it happening in the 1st world atleast.

Bitcoin will be the most popular when people don't realize that app they are using is using bitcoin on the back end. 
  
People don't want to have to rethink value in a new currency. They just don't. They grew up with dollars/euros/yen, and know how much candy a $20 buys, or how much takeout costs, and all these markers in their minds for their entire life.  
  
Selling people on BTC is way harder then just making an app that uses BTC but displays in their local currency.

That would work great for everyone, not having libertarianism?
    
Save me the BS about bitcoin's "agenda" or "why bitcoin was made" or your article from the genesis block about "2nd bailout to banks". Bitcoin is a protocol like email, HTTP, TCP/IP, WIFI.... it can be found useful for anyone who can find a use for it. Sure bitcoin does have some libertarian ideas going for it, but that is not going to matter to the people sending money on a 2nd layer where all they see their local currency displayed and don't even know they are using bitcoin. Just like someone who uses YouTube not having to worry about how it works. Was email an attempt to subvert the government run monopoly on mail? No it was neat tech that gave more freedom to people, that doesn't make it a "libertarian" protocol.

I would never say you need it have a growing economy, just enough to continue functioning is fine.  
  
I also hoped this wouldn't turn into an IQ thing so quickly. For the sake of argument I am not going to question the things you stated.
  
It is so hard to properly use IQ as an argument for someones value, it all breaks down so quickly the moment you value Group A who has done nothing right/wrong with Group B who has done nothing right/wrong but Group B is not as valuable as group A. I don't like dumb people anymore than you do, but when you stop seeing people as people rather than IQ numbers, things get pretty dystopian really quickly.
To extrapolate a bit with a hypothetical: Average IQ in the USA is ~111 points in CT but ~89 points in Alabama. If Connecticut secedes from the union should it ban people from Alabama from living there? It would be a positive thing to keep less intelligent people out right, with that 22 point difference? I mean it makes sense right? I would oddly agree with lots of intelligence based laws, but there are just reasons you can't do it without really screwing up society. And that sucks, because I think CT would be better off, but there are plenty of people in CT below 90 IQ, but not every job needs a high IQ. I cannot tell them they cannot live there because they are stupid, it breaks society. And besides we already have enough things to divide up.
  
Also the quality of life in the US will never be the same as it was before globalization, you cannot get that back, people are going to mix and the culture will change, and that is ok. Personally I don't care for things changing around me in general, it sucks. 
  
Thanks for talking to me, I appreciate it, even though I don't share your views, I understand your points and where you are coming from.  
  
IQ checks, while understandable cannot be implemented humanly on a mass scale and I feel it would break society more than it would help.

My point about Japan was the idea that a 1st world ethnostate has a hard time existing because the more people get educated, the less kids they seem to end up having. I also was sure I had mentioned their immigration system was tough.  
  
Also the food choices thing was just a basic example of spreading your culture to other people. There are many ways to do it though.  
  
I am confused though why you think we should all be kept separate? I have less in common with an Australian person of my ethnicity than I do someone local not of my own race. People are just people and anyone that is so dysfunctional that they cannot handle basic differences seems more like the problem than a society of different races. I also think many backgrounds makes an interesting place to live, can you imagine how dull a city would be with just standard cookie cutter American institutions vs all these unique independent businesses? Although I will assume those don't sound like pros things to you.  
  
But I understand you may look at it a different way, I just don't seem to understand why living next to a brown guy is such a big deal, nor do I understand why you think cultural diversity will vanish without strict borders? Or that the mixing of races has been going on since their were different races and that is one of the ways sometimes evolution would take a jump forward? A new mutation, some new genes spliced in a way that did not happen in a closed racial structure. And if interracial stuff is only 4% than you have several thousands of years before you see a major "problem". Genetic engineering will massively complicate our collective DNA more than two people hooking up ever could, and we are much closer to that problem than the "problem" of people mixing. 
  
Also where do you want an ethnostate? Making that happen in any place but Europe and you are going to have a very hard time. And you get your state and then what? I think the whole idea is a bit off but I have no objections if you just want to take one European country, then everyone who is white and would like one can live there. Again I think its misguided, but if it gets people asking for a white ethnostate out of the equation I think it would be worth it. Still gotta boost that white birthrate though.  
  
I also don't understand your concern about racial extinctions, there is not enough time between now and the advent of routine human gene editing. Which is going to be way more of an issue than skin color.  
  
My point being, live next to am immigrant family, they might not be the same color or the same religion, and sometimes there is some cooking with spices you don't understand but you both wake up every day and go to your jobs. You might not both act the same way all the time but I don't see why that matters.  
  
On top of it all I find it really hard to just even imagine getting enough people bugged by this basic stuff to get on board with an ethnostate, a good chunk of people just don't care. Might work in parts of Europe, but that is going to be hard to pull off across the board in America.

Better if it is a renewable power source.

I think the US birthrate will continue to fall. It is already at 1.8 children per couple, meaning more people are dying than there are people to replace them. Immigration will surely follow for the economy to work right. Demographics will shift surely, but I don't see how that is a problem. Demographics change, culture evolves, what it means to be American will change, just as it has changed many times in the past.

blockchain is the name of the underlying tech behind bitcoin. There happens to be a site called "Blockchain.info" that is just a bitcoin wallet using the term. There are other terms that bitcoin uses that have be co-opted for a company name. Coinbase the company has nothing to do with the term "coinbase" that is used when talking about the technical underbelly of Bitcoin.  
  
So yeah companies seem to cause confusion with how they name their companies.

Seems to me that if what you saying is correct I would feel BCH's main competitor is Litecoin rather then BTC? Thanks for taking the time to respond.  
  
My point was more about how Apple didn't really start their company thinking music players would be a huge part of their business model at some point, as they originally wanted to go about selling consumers on computers. Not that it's wrong to focus on something else down the line, it just seems to be the organic flow of a project/company.  
  
Personally I would be a lot more interested in BCH if I saw more innovation/development out of it. And please don't think for a minute I get most of my news about currencies on this or any subreddit. I do my own research. Again I am glad bitcoin forked, we can both see what comes out of it.

You don't even need it to be an internet attack, the real danger is big Xerox machines end up being resold. There was an article a few years ago about buying these printers (or just the drives in them) in a lot. It turned out several of them were from the police department and they were able to get so much confidential stuff of of it.  
  
The whole unit doesn't even need to be resold, when they are scarped and the HDD is taken out to resell with other former printer HDDs in a lot.

But at some point isn't a $100 jump in price very impactful if bitcoin is $5000, but a $100 drop/jump in price is less in percentage terms if bitcoin is $300,000. Still less than a 0.034% change in price vs 2% change in price. So if you are paying a tab for $30, it is not really going to matter about that +/-0.034% is it? And as the value goes up the impact of $100 is less and less. Also the market gets bigger and less manipulable as it grows.  
  
Numbers are not my prediction just for use for examples.

Thank you for the link I will surely look into it, despite my high chance of disagreeing with it going it, it is always important to see where the other side of the argument comes from. Also thanks for taking the time for another thought out reply.  
    
I do not think the white European race is going anywhere anytime soon. And if they do vanish it won't just be because of their birth rate, but that mixing of races, that will continue to go on for thousands of year (if we don't get nuked or have a pandemic). I am not saying it is headed to a one race world, but going to its logical conclusion that COULD happen. People seem to be finding it less and less of a big deal that they are dating someone of a different race. Now it is not happening in mass numbers, so it's not going to happen fast but it is going to happen. Just like if you put many thousands of different dogs from around the world in an enclosure and wait a few thousand years (with food)... you will get feral dogs that are extremely mixed. I am not going to say it will be one breed but, left to their own devices both dogs and people are very horny. Now people are not dogs, nor have they ever mixed in a way that air travel now affords them. They can choose to stick to only their race and that is their choice, but people seem to care about that less and less. I know that sounds like a liberal view, but I assure you that is what reports statistics seem to indicate about pairing up outside of ones race and I drew my own conclusions there.  
  
Also current minorities are VERY good at preserving their heritage. The amount of cultural events happen all over the country all the time, even at the local level. So I would imagine that European heritage minded people will do the same. Or for example the growth of the international food industry. It's no longer "Do you want pizza or Chinese?" it's more "Do you want Pizza, Chinese, Indian or Sushi?". People are getting more adventurous with their food choices and food alone exposes people to a culture not of their own that they might find interesting. Very rarely do I see a Japanese sushi place that is all full of pictures, statues and many trinkets on the walls. This seems to expose people to the culture WHILE they are also enjoying the food. (Weebos that learn Japanese and move to Japan, for a crude extreme example).
  
I understand your concern with culture loss but their will always be places to celebrate it, regardless of how small the minority group is. Does it suck that it is not all around you all the time anymore? Yeah it does as it seems important to you. But the melting pot that is America pretty much set this path out hundreds of years ago and America keeps growing with every new wave of people.  
  
People taking their culture with them to new lands, and what it means to be a white European in America will change, but it doesn't mean that is a bad thing or that it is going to be erased. Just like their are so many Irish-American and Russian-American and Italian-America associations, lodges and clubs. I just think that will increase as the country changes. Is it ever going to be the same? No it is not, but that's okay. And you can do your part to preserve white European culture, but you are not going to get enough people to get 50% of the vote for a nearly closed country, it is just not going to happen, at least at this point in time in the USA. Yes their are a lot of people who want strong borders, but not enough of those people that want to STOP people from coming to the USA entirely. Although its not always about a vote on one topic now is it?    
  
Put all that aside for a moment and realize the birth rate in the US is below replacement. Meaning more people are dying than are being born, and this is a new thing for the US but it has been happening in Japan for what is 2 decades now (or longer if you count the economic crash of '89 as starting it off). And it is not going really well. Adult diapers outsell baby diapers their for the last 4 years. Their population is dropping, they are not letting people in. They can encourage people to have kids through tax breaks and other things, they have tried. People their are living alone into their 30s/40s and just don't want kids. Japan has a very strict policy in regards to immigration, mostly due to the xenophobic history Japan has. I cannot imagine growing up in a small rural/suburban Japanese town and how much of a rarity it would be to see a black guy in the market or walking around town.  
  
Now you can totally encourage more people of European decent to have kids, but you really can't force someone to. Besides I don't think you don't have enough people that are heavily committed to continuing their line of genetics/heritage, by having a first or another baby they don't really want.  
  
BUT you can work to organize local people of your heritage, start a club or even a start *sigh* lobby group like many immigrant groups do. Meet every 2nd Saturday and eat traditional foods and have someone play the folk songs from your heritage.  
  
Just because whites will be a majority minority by ~2048, doesn't mean that white influence is not going to heavily effect the culture for the next 150 years. It is heavily entrenched due to wealth and the government having all high up positions, which are still, very boldly white. So maybe things are not as they were, but you can do your part to make sure your heritage does not get lost.  
  
Saying all that, interracial couples will continue to be more common, and as other heritages display more prominence then they once had. But as Japan representation in America.. if you have an interesting culture it will be adapted by kids growing up (video games, anime, sushi...). Can you imagine trying to open a sushi shop in the 1980's or any friend recommending it as a thing to go do? Of course not, but its part of the melting pot now and sushi is now everywhere, anime is everywhere and video games as an industry were saved by Japanese companies after the US game crash caused by Atari in the early 80's.  
  
I would love to chat more, but I spent some time writing this so any reply (outside of a short supply) to your reply will be something I handle tomorrow as putting all these thoughts in a fleshed out post took more time than I thought it would.  
**PS &amp; edit:**  
Thank you again for talking to me about this, I know I don't share your views entirely and maybe none of the stuff we wrote to each other will change our minds, although I am always open to being wrong and I have been in the past. But it is so important to look into and debate what these questions about race and society together and not just turn shouting matches. Although hopefully I gave someone reading this a different view on things then they may have heard in the past or maybe stuff they were thinking they couldn't quite pin down into words and maybe you achieved the same.
  
**I don't have a TL;DR but:** Culture is adapted if we in the US find it interesting, useful or helpful for business. Things will always change but you can do your part to keep your culture relevance relevant. As sad as it is, I don't think you can get enough people to care about their heritage to continue it with the life long commitment of a baby. Whites in the US are not replacing themselves so you can:  
   
A. Encourage more kids.  
B. Preserve your heritage by making a local group to celebrate and share your heritage with the world.  
C. Accept that things are changing and that's not the end of the world.  
D. All of the above.

Okay lets put aside the "buying out competition" and say the large store is just offering cheaper prices because they can do it and still make a profit? If I missed something I am sorry but you seemed to focus on the buying out competition part which was merely an afterthought to my question.  
  
I mean sure paradigm shifts can happen (globalization, online sales, ect) but those are few and far between and would lead someone to have a monopoly for 3+ decade.   
  
Note: It's arguable when full on globalization started and the next paradigm shift, Online sales (or is it possibly another phase of globalization?)  
Also one could argue other shifts such as but not limited to: Electricity, Cotten Gin, Radio, TV, Telephone, Currency, Printing Press, Trans-Atlantic Travel, Slaves....

In no way did I want to imply that people should be using bitcoin and its this easy thing to do. I would not tell a single non-tech person to buy some, even some of my tech friends I would not totally trust to handle it. Bitcoin will not be popular until people don't even know they are using it, maybe with an app that displays denominations in their countries native currency (maybe small text with the bitcoin value). As much as I don't mind, getting people to rethink the values they had in their head for everyday things their entire life? That is an uphill battle I don't think Bitcoin should focus on right now. Getting it into user hands is so much more important. All your concerns are valid.

Or... or a country could embed said computer INSIDE a coin. Would be an encrypted NFC wallet that the country has the BIP38 keys to. So one could exchange the coin regularly for day to day life when someone wants to "take" the bitcoin out of the money they can do so at certain country owned or licensed locations. Then the "spent" coin is flashed with new private keys.   
  
Silly idea? Sure. Just thought it was interesting.

I was under the impression that most of paypals "fee" comes from using SWIFT ( to send the money from place to place (and of course having no real competition).  
  
As for user adoption, have you seen how many people use BoA, Citi, Wells-Fargo, ect... APPs on their phones already? Would it really be that hard to add an E-currency into it? Or better yet just using it on the back end for inter-Bank Alliance transfers to reduce cost of sending said money for almost nothing. The user not even knowing they are ever dealing with anything but $?  
  
Money still will get frozen, debased and confiscated. And as much as I love that Bitcoin can not be, the average person don't seem to care about it, all they are seeing is the bottom line. Have you seen how popular the Venmo app has become despite being hooked to banks/cards?  
  
Imagine if they classified the E-Currency in such a way that it fell under FDIC (either by changing the way FDIC works or pegging it to the dollar or any other fun language they can put in a bill)?  
  
Decentralization is great, but getting people to care about it is hard when so few people understand "money" as it is. I am interested in its zero/low fee and 24/7 aspects of Bitcoin. The fact that a bank ever "closes" (at 5pm no less) and is closed entirely on one day a week (Sunday) in 2015 is freaking stupid. The fact that money takes 3-4 business days to transfer at times, when it is really just a change in a database file somewhere is just as stupid. Why am I writing checks still? The internet has changed basically everything from stores, auctions, interactions, video, books, relationships... ect. Yet money has barely been effected.  
  
These reasons I have always thought were some of the main drivers for VC funding for Bitcoin after the initial (and still continuing) Libertarian leaning VC funding wave. I man be totally wrong about this and if so I apologize.

While I totally get what you are saying and agree that banks cannot make a 100% Bitcoin killer... But I think you underestimate how many people into bitcoin are interested mostly in the ability to send money with a very low or zero fee. An alliance of banks making an E-Currency just using a standard ledger database would be huge even if it could be just half the fee of a paypal transaction.

Let's say someone owns a general store, it is successful and grows to more locations, the stores themselves get bigger and have an highly efficent distribution network. The store sells lots of goods so they can afford to make less money on each sale (sort of a walmart situation but without gov tax breaks and min wage issues). They make so much money now they can afford to buy out the competition, ect. What is to stop that company from becoming a monopoly?  
  
I am actually interested and am not being argumentative. Just trying to figure out what mechanism a libertarian society would have in place to ensure that each town doesn't just have one store.  
  
I also get that you would no longer need a license, permits ect. to sell stuff (aka barrier to entry). But how does a newcomer open up a store when they can't sell say a 12 pack of Coca-cola for $2.11 like the larger general store can. I mean sure they can have better customer service, but that will only take you so far, and for most people great customer service is not worth having -$50 or so added to your bottom line a month (if one does all there shopping at the larger store vs. the new store).

As long as its still cheaper then paypal for $30+, which is what really attracted me to bitcoin, well that and easy to set up payments and the cool tech behind it. It would seem like it will keep going up at this point, will be interesting to see what if anything changes about bitcoin's use/implementations/sidechains and its competition with altcoins over transaction fee.

maybe a reduction in heat and more overclockablity with its smaller die size? Also maybe at some point the % jump from each gen is going to be huge? Like watching the CPU market the last 5 years or so. The die gets smaller and things get faster, but not like the huge jumps of 2000-2010

Nobody big like that is using exchanges for big purchases in the millions of dollars. They would go through trading desks that get you the rate you want without shooting the market up on one exchange. Not that it still doesn't take away the available supply of coins, but its not going to make that kind of instant spike happen.
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:02:08
Thanks for the reply.  
Yeah mircotransactions can surely be done with fiat. Not really sure why they haven't, but bitcoin seems like a nice cross website and cross country currency when you go through an online wallet that you pre load every once and awhile. The 3rd party then settles funds with the sites in batches at the end of the month.  
  
Projects funded, I meant more chance for non-accredited investors to invest in startups.  
  
Autonomous corp would not BE on the blockchain, bitcoin allows a program to own money. For example, one could put a PC in the middle of a field, weather proof it and power with solar and battery. Hook this computer up to the internet with a satellite internet connection. The computer is running a paid for service, weather that is a VPN/Proxy, remote storage, or an runs arbitrary program. Perhaps it decrypts something with code that is "illegal" to run in many countries. Whatever the service is it provides the computer with payments in bitcoin. This bitcoin goes to the internet bill (automatic reoccurring payment) as well as general maintenance. When the computer has a problem or goes down, a backup of a Rapsberry Pi board sends a signal to a company to come out and fix the problem and the bill is paid once the system gets back up. I am also sure someone could come up with an easy system that notices when the internet is down, perhaps on one of those many contract coins.  
  
So the theory is that once the initial setup is done, it should be able to run by itself continually. Basically it gives a system the ability to own money and pay for itself.  
  
Now yes the people who started it up still technically owns the PC and the setup, but if they die or declare it abandoned it just keeps running and making money and fixing itself. That was the basic idea with that. Maybe it makes no financial sense at the moment but that could not have EXISTED before bitcoin was introduced.  
  
Bitcoin will not rise forever but the idea is it deflates. It is not going to see huge % swings 20 years from now as it does today. But it will beat storing value in an inflationary currency. Yes that money should be invested but I think it's nice to have a currency that doesn't have inflation backed in by default. 
  
Now maybe a UScoin would do a lot of these things and I think it would be a big success. But they haven't. When they do I will look at the fees and re-evaluate the situation from there.

I get that, I just see that brought up a lot. Thankful for what they did, but I don't really worry to much about what their views are in the same way I am not concerned with the political leanings of the guy who created email. Now surely money has more to do with politics than email, but at some point we have to let Satoshi go. It makes a nice story, but society already has enough arguments brought down about what some dead/gone person would have to say about the current state of something (politics, religion, constitutions).  
  
I think the farther bitcoin moves away from Satoshi the more healthy it will be. We are less than 10 years in and only 7 years removed from Satoshi's last appearance yet we still ended up with a mini-civil war where "Satoshi's Vision" was a main talking point of one side. It dragged on for 2 years before a fork and now has entered a second phase of tribalism. I cannot imagine how heated this kind of thing would become given an entire generation polarization.  
  
Satoshi being anonymous was very important as it created no owner/god/king/CEO for bitcoin. But Satoshi still being brought up as a point of argument 9 years on, is and will continue to be destructive to bitcoin. Obviously do not erase bitcoin history, but talking about Satoshi in anyway outside of the context of the early days of bitcoin is not helpful.
**TL;DR: Bitcoin is stronger without Satoshi, even though Satoshi is an important part of bitcoin history. What "Satoshi wanted" can be interesting but we should not put much weight in it going forward. He has been gone 7 of the 9 years the bitcoin network has been running. It is open source and is really no longer "his" project**

Bitcoin is a lot of things to a lot of people. Just like any other thing on the internet. I really think it's a better store of value but with the Lightning Network developments, it may still be a currency, at least off chain. Sure it won't ever be as robust as a government currency but it is a nice option to have.  
  
Just in the way lots of people use youtube for almost exclusively music, even though it is probably not the optimal platform to share music on. Or you can still play chess by email if you really wanted. It's clunky, but it's nice to have the option.
@_date: 2015-09-20 23:51:15
I do not disagree with any of your points. I was merely pointing out that all the things Bitcoin can do for the average person in the current environment (peoples education, regulatory stuff, adoption, ect). I am well aware that Bitcoin doesn't need an FDIC, but the average person wants it (regardless of how right or wrong that is). And of course the banks can use a permissioned ledger to do all those things, but they have not. Why? No competition, which Bitcoin provides. Which is a great thing.  
  
As for the APP thing, yes I said, funds will get frozen and accounts closed. But if they pull it off reasonably okay (with accounts still locked and frozen from time to time) before BTC gets its act together and the average person is taught how money actually works.... it is removing some of the reasons to switch to BTC. If that makes any sense.  
I think bitcoin will continue to grow and create more competition causing better/cheaper/faster options for the consumer. You are correct the average person IS missing out by not using bitcoin.

Maybe they are more overclockable/stable and produce less heat? Or maybe there are gains to be made with firmware upgrades alone? And also at some point the % jump in mining gains from gen to gen are going to slow down anyway, like the CPU market (correct me if I am wrong)

Every hack has been to exchanges not the bitcoin network itself. If a bank gets robbed you don't blame USD. It is basically the same thing. As for stolen coins, it is again a human error rather than the network breaking. Much like if you don't realize that you have a $20 bill sticking out of your pocket or you email a picture to the wrong person.  
  
Now I agree that stolen coins is just a terrible thing, but how do you propose we stop it from happening? Any solution I can think of involves some kind of human committee to say "yes these were stolen, we are going to fork the chain so they go back to their rightful owners". But then we have just added a human point of error to the protocol, who decides who gets to be on the committee?  
Again it's terrible people have had their money stolen, but I don't know what kind of trustless way we can realistically get it back without adding humans to the equation.

Not to jump on you here but you do know that the base layer is not really for buying a cup of coffee with, right?  
  
**The layers on top of it are the important part.** (layman terms:) TCP/IP protocol has HTTP protocol on top, which also has added HTTPS, and the layer on top (a website built in HTML + a browser) **brings us Youtube, iTunes, Spotify, blogs.** You could go back farther and that stuff was built on early ARPNET (there was much in between but not typing it all out) things and that was built on assembly language which was in turn built on binary code. Everything is built on everything else. You can't share a video or anything without all these layers built on top.  
  
**It would be great if the base layer could be used like it once was, but the Bitcoin network keeps growing, so we need layers on top. Base layer should be used for strictly settlement**, or paying the cost to store something directly on the most uncensorable network the world has ever seen.  
  
Build other coins on top of bitcoin if you want, it can be done. **But with the way a first gen coin like bitcoin works, expanding becomes hard without layers.**

MOST people don't want to be their own bank. Just like most people don't want to run their own email server. BUT the idea is that you can.  
  
Really though, bitcoin will take off when people don't know they are using it. A simple app that shows prices in the user's native currency. Most trades will happen off chain and settled on the chain once every 24 hours (unless it's to a BTC address). You forget your password? No problem, the company can help. Just like services sprung up around email.  
  
Don't get me wrong, bitcoin is going places all by itself with the main chain and other layers. But I think it's foolish to think that when the number one password year after year is "password", and that those same people can handle their own security for something as valuable as money? No they should NOT be their own bank, but they now have the option if they ever wanted to.
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:12:26
Bitcoin adds the ability to be your own bank IF you want to as well as a borderless currency. It also adds a feasible way for a startup to transact and make a fintech app like I describe in the first place without the barrier to entry of the massive team of lawyers and lobbying that paypal had to go through to even start up (which is why their are so few viable paypal alternatives).  
  
And if you think you are going to win people over with having them have to rethink the currency they have used their whole life... I just don't see that happening overnight or even over a decade. I feel having a bold text of $2 for a candybar in the app with maybe smaller text under it showing the BTC value, is a good place to start with the majority of people.  
  
Again I am not saying that BTC needs this to go mainstream, I feel like an app like this will help with the uphill battle to get:  
1. People to rethink what money is.  
2. People to rethink the prices of things they have used all their life.  
3. Have the average person handle their cash when they can barely handle email security.

I enjoy it from a technical standpoint as well as the low fees compared to Paypal... ~$0.08 to send any amount to anyone in any country at any hour a day? Hell yes. Also it's so nice not having to use a 3rd party. I sell and buy stuff online and not having someone take anywhere from 8% to 15% really helps. It is astounding (but not unexpected) that the internet does not have it's own native currency by now.
  
But of course if the US made their own digital currency that was competitive I couldn't say entirely that I would not use it for at least domestic stuff. But I much rather Bitcoin succeed then for that to happen, and would probably give discounts to Bitcoin users if that was the case.

Well it looks like several people including undercover FBI agents had a hold of his DPR admin account on the Silk Road. Ross's writing is very casual, no caps... and it drastically changes between certain messages used in court to convict him. Also DPR sent a message AFTER he go arrested. Then there was the whole corruption of the FBI agents taking BTC from Silk Road. He is in the wrong but I feel the whole story was not presented at his case.
  
I believe he deserves jail time, but not two life sentences and no parole for non-violent crime is crazy. He never sold anything on Silk Road, he was just taking a %. That still looks bad and he should get some jail time for it, but not in a max security prison that also has the Boston Bomber* in there.  
  
  
  
**Edit: He actually was the 1st vendor &amp; sold mushrooms, thank you Edit2: "Ross is at Florence High, while the bomber is at ADX Florence. Same complex but ADX is worse." thank you u/Cherman321**
  
The whole thing is a moral question. Does someone setting up a site for people to sell things and skimming off a % of what people decide to sell/buy with their own free will... really constitute a similar sentence like a drugload king Pablo Escabar who actually personally killed many people? Yes he was out to get money and money was a motivation, it was not all idealistic. My personal feeling from what I read is I don't know if he expected Silk Road to get as big as it did and as fast as it did and kinda fell into it. Again, still gets time in prison.  
  
Yeah what he did was wrong, but two life sentences are too much. A retrail where they don't bring up the dismissed charges of a hit is needed. Even if he did scheduled a hit, that's only 10 years in prison. Although I would lose most sympathy if it ever comes out that the hit was even real.  
  
There are a lot of moving parts and I really can't sum it up well here. If you are interested try reading both stories about it by crypto sites and also regular media. There are some great write ups that I don't have links. He really should have know what he was doing when he was making this site. He was just a 26* year old who was idealistic. He deserves time, just not what he got.  
  ***thanks to r/caro_lala for pointing out he was 26 and not 29***
  
Honestly I am not that invested, lot's of people here know way more. I think it's sad he is in prison but I don't think he will get a retrail or any happy news for some time.  
  
But I think there is some merit to a site that you can review drug dealers, get quality product and not worry it's laced with something. But should the site be legal? That's another whole topic with pros/cons.  
  
*If I got something wrong let me know, thanks.* ***I am really not that personally invested in the story***,* I just read a lot and thought I would answer the question and stop lurking.
  
**TL;DR** The case against him had big holes, two FBI peeps working on it charged with corruption, DPR sent a message after he got arrested and the account was held by several people, bringing up the dismissed hit did not help in court, he deserves time in prison, but the sentencing was terrible.  
  
***He is not a saint.***

**Bitcoin will be successful when people don't realize they are using it.**  
Hear me out. People don't understand money, they don't want to rethink or start to think about that. They don't know how much a coffee or chocolate bar is in BTC. They need a simple app that shows local currency rates and than smaller font bitcoin values under it. Transactions will be batched together and only sent to the network for settlement at the end of the day or if the BTC is sent off network or use the LN. Overtime people might learn BTC values for things. People want convenience, tech support, chargebacks and the ability to reset passwords. You and I might not but most of the world does and they are willing to trade so much for that convenience.   
  
**I don't need to know how every part in a car works to use it. I just need to know that when I press the gas pedal, it moves.**
  
  
I wish this was not the case but people don't care how protocols work for the most part. In general people don't know how file systems or HTTP work but they enjoy the benefits of it with a simple "Upload Video" button on youtube.  
  
Trust me at one point I thought we could all be our own banks, and we can, I just don't think the majority wants that or knows it wants that. Which I guess is why money under the mattress went out of style.

What does a raw bitcoin smell like? I know you are serious or something but put that aside for a moment, I kinda really want to know.
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:51:43
Look I agree it silly but it gets people experience on how to use stuff. Not new outsiders, that rarely happens, but maybe a bitcoiner that has never done anything outside of buying bitcoin and putting it in a wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:01:51
Thanks for your well thought out reply. Your point about the impact these people have on regular news stations is something I had not considered. I also meant numbers like every news station gets. Yes I am sure their are millions of people who like Alex Jones, but how many personalities can claim that. I might be wrong, I will look into more like you suggest and you are correct about the loudest thing, I thought I had put that in my post.  
  
As for regulation, I didn't mean to say it was a good or bad idea, just that it will happen in some form or another. The laws we have to go after tech companies for a variety of things are not even on the books yet. The whole debate about tech updates, DRM and planned obsolescence hasn't even started yet. The public has little recourse over what big tech does to them on an individual level. The laws will change, weather that is good or bad remains to be seen, but at this point it's still the wild west.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:51:27
Not going to donate to a douche so bitcoin goes up in price. I don't think the ends justify the means. But I suppose that is a moral question.  
  
Then again I have heard this "He/She has 2 Million followers and they just twitter about bitcoin". It doesn't seem to have any effect.

I agree I don't understand what reality some of these commenters live in. We need coinbase as a legit onramp, people thinking one can change the worlds laws overnight or that bitcoin companies should not comply with the laws (either just or unjust) is just plain silly. Bitcoin won't ever grow if the companies and services around it don't play the game a bit.  
  
As for torrents/copyright/ect that is whole other issue that coinbase cannot solve by themselves nor would they make much of an impact by denying a request (except maybe being sued and going under). If using coinbase goes against your morals don't use it. Risk/Reward.

This is an amazing solution for anyone who doesn't have an old dedicated computer just for crypto.  
  
Do not use wallets on windows, it is very unsafe, it is the most unsecured desktop environment for crypto.

No those charges were dropped and never proved in court. He is in jail for running a website that sells drugs.
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:41:37
Yeah that why society uses a it's a balance of the two. It is a cost/benefit analysis certain things we are okay with like still selling fireworks, other things are over regulated and infringe on a persons rights.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:50:49
It is still an estimate rather than a solid number. Either way the best outcome for bitcoin is that Satoshi is dead, IMO Satoshi was Dave Kleiman, or the coins they had are unspendable.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:01:08
This is by far the best comment I have read in years.
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:27:10
He does not have control over the coins, the dumping has all been handled by lawyers.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:24:24
I am not saying he is innocent, far from it. I was just trying to show he had his life ahead of him which is related to a public letter he sent the judge before sentencing, saying he knows he lost his middle age but was hoping the judge would let him at least enjoy his old age. 
  
But I suppose it all depends on how you view drugs and the war on drugs. I am not gonna even mention he had a clean record before this whole thing. There was no life of crime, just a big mistake to start a website on ideals rather than paying attention to the laws. He gambled and lost, but the sentencing is too harsh.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:03:46
Agreed. As much as it would be interesting if it was approved, I don't see it happening in the near future.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:34:54
I was simply talking about the ways companies control, protect and sell your private data will be someday be more regulated than it is now. Things are headed in that direction in 1st world countries regardless of what you or I think is the best idea.  
  
As for being banned from a ubiquitous platform, that is a more complicated issue that I am not sure of the answer right now.
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:46:11
Yes I get you, in a vacuum I get you. The weak minded are everywhere, which mean you and I can not have access to cocaine or heroin if we were to want to try some. That sucks. I get it. But I moved on. Would it be nice to be able to try them if a had a terminal illness? Yes. But I am not going to watch people who don't know any better, have low impulse control destroy themselves with addiction for that privilege.  
  
The victims are the weak minded, we are not going to see eye to eye on this.  
  
Let's just say I am wrong.

I agree that QR codes are a barrier to entry and there has to be a better way down the line.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:47:47
And that is cool and everything, but I don't believe this guy is doing all he is doing in good faith. The way he manipulates words make people follow him. I am sure he is a his great in his field of research, but his ideas about anything other than that is just a mess in my opinion.  
  
Don't get me wrong I get what you are saying, I just don't like him. Bitcoin doesn't care, so he is going to do it anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:31:21
Sure but I don't think the people who go to these small sites or youtube channels have any meaningful numbers, even the bigger ones like InfoWars. If it was a ban on a mainstream right leaning politician using paypal, yeah you can get people to support that, but you can't get those same numbers when it is these smalltime "controversial" journalists. The numbers are just not going to be there, not enough people care.  
    
We really can't have a decent talk about deplatforming either until there are regulations that say paypal cannot do what they did, and right now, for better or worse, paypal can do what it wants. So a bill or something needs to be drafted in the US. Other countries have a much tighter grip on big tech than in the US and have been making laws and regulations for years.  
  
I have not looked into the people banned yet.

Anyone "baffled" by linux and who has their bitcoin stuff on a Windows machine should look into this as the easiest way to install bitcoin core on a Linux OS.
**To use this PPA to install bitcoin core, open a terminal window and type(after each line hit enter):**  
 
*sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin*   
*sudo apt-get update*  
*sudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt*  
**Then to run type:**  
*bitcoin-qt*

if only the update happened more often than every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks). But I am sure there is a reason this is still left this way. Litecoin's difficulity update happens much faster. If Litecoin is just a clone of bitcoin, is there some variable that one could just change? or is it more complicated than that and we are keeping blocktime for a reason like security/privacy or something?
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:12:54
Because sometimes non-violent crime results in being locked up weather I always agree with it or not.  
  
Look my views on how to handle drug problems as well as my views on sentences for crimes are a less than standard. For once I almost agree with the libertarian view of how to handle drugs, but not fully. I was merely writing up something based on how I view things but through a lens of a normal person as well as the laws that are actually one the books. I don't know what he deserves, just not what he got.  
  
I think the whole legal system is a mess.
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:28:27
Nope, I could be totally wrong, maybe I am. I appreciate your search of the truth, was just trying to answer a question with things that I thought were right from lots of things I had read from various news outlets, both big, small and fringe. I can't live my life doing situations as I am not writing a academic paper and this whole thread will vanish into the sea of reddit in 24 hours. So let's just say I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:47:18
Fuck Satoshi. 
  
On a sidenote I actually would like segwit... I just hate having an almost demigod to worship and worry about what they wanted. It is not his project anymore and has not been for years.
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:24:51
I am saying I don't know. Look I don't agree with the prison system, putting people away is a stupid form of justice. I think the whole ethics on doing that is so wrong. The fact we dont even try to rehabilitate and that prison seems like a system of revenge rather than fixing people. It just makes people worse, it puts killers next to tax cheats which is wrong. Solitary confinement is torture. I am with you on so many things here, but I can't go down the libertarian rabbit hole with you about prison. I have done it before and it always comes down to I don't know the answer, mostly because I don't know what we should do for non-violent offenders.
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:33:49

But could ethereum not have a side chain that did everything bitcoin does and more? Bitcoin cannot do the opposite without further development. Outside of "do one thing do it right" and chain length and/or hashrate advantage does bitcoin really have? Hopefully what I am trying to say makes sense. Actually wondering here and not just stating my opinion.

Who? I mean I can read the article, a patreon competitor is a good thing, but getting off the ground to work with any kind of credit card will be impossible, **people forget it was MasterCard not Patreon that got people shut down.** But I also think its still too early in the general to go full crypto. But maybe it's a chicken and the egg thing.
  
  
Unrelated: I still think the guy is a douche.

I don't think it is an issue right now due to how rarely people use Bitcoin for transactions. Somebody is going to make an wallet app that looks polished as all hell as if Apple designed it. But I really don't know if that app will be a small time operation that gets big or Google/Apple/Samsung just implementing it. Either way its not used enough for any of those tech companies to bother at the moment. Public adoption is a long time away.
