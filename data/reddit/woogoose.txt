I don't even need to click that link to know what it is

I am based in the UK and have a horrid time trying to transfer money to/from an exchange's central account.
If I can have an account that I call my own, send fiat back and fourth, and use it to buy/sell BTC, then shut up and take my money!

My takeaway is that the goal of Bitcoin was never to kill banks; it was to kill central banking, or rather the bond between state and monetary supply.

Could be two bots using the same algorithm by different parties, or one party has discovered the algorithm in use by another bot and is trying to exploit it...

Exactly. Combine that with a solid API that I can wire an automated strategy to, and savvy individuals can explore the market without causing too much damage to their own balance or the market in general.

In this context, I mean any potential user that is contemplating using your platform to store and trade their funds.

These are the slides I prepared for a presentation on Bitcoin last week. Although the audience mostly comprised of software developers, there were several non-devs in attendance.
I spent a bit of time going over the basic cryptographic premises so that people could understand why it is constitutionally secure.
I hope that you find it useful in helping to describe some of the technical points in an understandable manner.

Physical security is one appealing factor. Another important, although more subtle factor, is that interest is an offset against inflation.
When you store cash under your mattress, not only is it at risk of being stolen, but its buying power will diminish over time. When it earns interest, at least you go some way to making up that loss.
Cue the financial crisis, when interest rates fell below inflation, leading to a 'negative real rate'. Savers (or those that represented them) had no incentive to continue offering their funds for loan.

Absolutely. Whilst not an out-and-out requirement that a platform provide this information, it certainly helps matters. I use Bitfinex right now, and Kraken clearly has a more intuitive and appealing interface. If they can demonstrate by some degree that their technical team is just as or if not more competent than Bitfinex, I shan't hesitate in starting a margin account there.
Fee schedule permitting of course ;)

You gain investor confidence that your technical team is capable of understanding the threats that exist and working to prevent/mitigate them.
