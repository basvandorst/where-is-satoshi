Lightning wont solve anything when the use case is store of value. People will keep seeing btc as an investment, hence more and more will want to trade usd for btc. The adoption hasn’t really moved 20x in 2017, but price has.

I think posts like this are in vain. This can only trick a user, not a business. Businesses have (philosophy aside) technical sophistication to see through these.
Businesses vote counts. I guess these posts can lead to "what are you doing to my funds?" Kinda support emails to push businesses with the threat of losing business. But we are very early in crypto currency land to do that. "Most" of the users are just gambling with their money to see 10x returns. They dont know or care about philosophy.

Chaging POW is good for Bitcoin cash.

Offended block will be rejected by my full node. But if this block happens to be on a chain with more accumulated difficulty and coinbase supports it, cant miner just go to coinbase and sell the BTC reward for $.
I am using coinbase for my transactions.

Vote using your hash power. 
Your node is not useful. You will get yourself kicked out of network.
Nodes of businesses are useful. 
Unfortunately many users trust them. Example, Users trust coinbase with their coins.

They should use raspberries.

Are you saying if sufficient full nodes reject a block, the node that created the block gets banned from the network?
Also, wont I have to open port 8333 for that?

Doesn't change the fact. If 1x nodes have more support, show using hashpower and keep the longest chain.
I will help mine and keep the chain alive.
