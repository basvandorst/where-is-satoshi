Gotta love the man for how unapologetically he is being himself and not giving a fuck about what you think

I don't talk about bitcoin so I don't have to listen to morons asking me about it...

I am gonna buy myself piece of land, build a reasonable sized house, build me couple workshops such as woodworking and blacksmithing and gym and will be making shit and training martial arts combined with eternal internet lurking all day, basically retire and fuckitall, do whatever I feel like doing and learning

anything online is not safe, take that from guy working in cybersecurity
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:04:29
used to do that, but quickly realized that moving from coinbase and trading for alts/tokens is more fun and more profitable
using BTC as "stable" currency when existing much more volatile alts/tokens

Sure, cool neighbors are welcomed, need to talk with someone about cool "Damascus" pattern I just forged over come home brewed IPA

cheers from Singapore, and I am not Singaporean so no HDB for me, hence starting at $1M for one bedroom apartment
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:33:15
that would imply same $ value of them alts, which is not happening, people are trading between BTC and alts like crazy trying to scrape for more of them bitcoins in total - tried to do that myself, but eventually deemed is too much work for not enough reward with huge loss potential
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:35:35
I have same approach to stocks as cryptos, picked companies I believe in and hold, any dividends go back into more stocks
My stock portfolio did solid 34% (Tech giants blue chips and cybersecurity) in last 14 months - nothing insane like crypto does, but better be diverse, than sorry if something goes south on some of your investments
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:17:33
do that, I moved to Singapore on my own for work and traveling around any chance I get for at least weekend getaways and learned more in a year than any damn college could ever teach me. Will make you smarter in life decisions about what matters and what doesn't
But please, don't be a fucking backpacker beggar with instagram account dedicated to their assholery

I was able to scrap $4k since 18yo to 25yo, bought and build mining rig on 2014/2015 for it, mined about 5BTC, sold the rig (due to moving abroad) and got about $2k back, hodl'd BTC, then bought some ETH, alts and token and now approaching $100k - those initial $4k were lifechanging for me as I was smart about it and didn't spend my money on partying or buying a car as everyone else my age did
//worth saying I am from eastern Europe so scraping mere $4k at that age is pretty solid achievement on it's own as most household/families doesn't has that in their savings, let alone one adolescent kid
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:20:26
bloody kids these days, let it hodl and mine on it's own and go outside, you are wasting your life watching candles

yeah I got free vacation in Japan myself, not beating myself now, nobody saw that coming, otherwise there would much more lambos around :) 
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:38:36
valid point, especially with tension now between USA and NK, however, that's exactly why I have cryptos and fiat reserve too, could be making more profit putting everything into crypto, but in case crypto goes south and I will need the money I still have something to take cover it from
unfortunately still not enough to buy property as investment, that's (in EU at least) very sound and stable investment, still reasonably liquid and generating steady return
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:56:40
thanks man, so far so good :) 
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:27:07
the initial excitement mate, used to be there myself, however there was no blockfolios and what not those days, so it was it was either at work in small windows in the corner of desktop or at university lecture on laptop and kept hypnotising stats of my miners in pool
I now dare to say I know what I am doing and put most of the money in long term investments, however still have few grands in basically gamble of shitcoins just for the thrill of it, I keep checking those

I mined some for fun at work when price was about $4 in 2010/2011, sold everything at $120 about 2 or 3 weeks before rocket to $1200 in 2k13 December... got so cranky that I haven't touched cryptos until 2015 again

remember, don't do coke, go for psychedelics instead, they won't ruin your life and it's much more fun

I would suggest considering monthly investment into Bitcoin that can be adjusted as your disposable income changes, instead of trying to save lump of money to one day buy in on a dip
I was sending money to bank saving account every month since I was 18 as I was financially conscious and wanted to have some cash for future endeavors, not a clue whatever they might have be at that time, pulled everything at 24 to buy GPU mining rigs and never looked back
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:27:05
Honestly, I am 28, fiddling with crypto since 2010, but since 2014 seriously and despite me trying to convince some of my friends around my age of 24 back then, just handful did, they mostly work in IT as I do, so they understand it very well (the basic concepts at least), but they see it as some sort of scam and what not...
and even those whom I convinced to jump on exited completely once either panic sold on dips or realized double digit percents profit and never bough back in...
Now I get shit all the time when I meet some of them and I am obviously doing well in term of personal finance "He is that virtual millionaire, but until you cash out, you have nothing anyways so don't act like you are loaded" of sorts
Never understood that attitude, they had the same opportunity and I was offering holding their hands in guidance so they wouldn't do the same mistakes as I did in the beginning, but they refused and are giving me shit now...
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:26:29
lol, if that happens we will have much bigger problems, than crying over lost cryptos/stocks

there is lot of people jumping the train during the spikes because of the news, then correction happens, whales collect their gains and go to alts to eat plankton over there and all the newcomers starts panic selling while price drops relatively fast and below where they bought in - hence new joiners will lose significant amount of their investments
I guess OP wants give them warning, but it's too general and says basically what everyone and every exchange says when you get into crypto as welcome message
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:37:42
or he could just make his own platform for crypto payments, why he would he ever need coinbase to accept crypto? this is just cheap marketing tweet
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:47:56
he died because he went for some mumbojumbo nonsense while he still had time to treat it with actual medicine... mumbojumbo didn't work and then it was too late for actual medicine to cure him... nothing to do with money, he was just too "convinced" about whatever he believed in

4 years ago I took my life savings and bought mining rig... nobody gives a shit and nobody needs to
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:52:46
luckily was able to withdraw most of the bitcoins before it went down and submitted last withdrawal in fiat about two weeks before the crash... never got that one
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:56:13
I started mining at $4 in small scale just for fun of it... got some double digits of BTC, forgot all about it, then it went to $100 so I sold everything and went for vacation to Japan for free essentially and when I returned, shit went to $1200 before it dropped back to $200
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:03:30
oh, right, my bad
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:06:16
throwing overplayed WB quote over messages from family showing concern and goodwill... is it really something worth sharing here? I understand you might be excited about the bitcoins and all around it, but 90% of this sub has same messages from their family/friends in their phone, if they talked about it with them, every time crypto hits the news...
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:58:47
yes, don't try to outsmart the market at this point, there is literally thousands of guys thinking the exact same stupid thing you are and are getting ripped by swings on daily or weekly trades

also too late to correct my mistake as I was already called out on it
