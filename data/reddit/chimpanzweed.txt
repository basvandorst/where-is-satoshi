The co-founder and former CEO of Kiva just gave a talk about entrepreneurship at my university last week. I spoke to her briefly over e-mail in the days before her event, and afterward I sent her a follow-up e-mail and brought up Bitcoin and its potential uses for certain Kiva operations she talked about in her lecture.
I pointed her to [this article]( that I thought would be right up Kiva's alley. No reply yet...

Because I'm a broke grad student and can read almost anything they publish for free elsewhere, but if I had the option to pay $0.25 in BTC to read an article at WSJ, I would in a heartbeat.

Great idea, and aside from what someone commented on the trust issue with granting access to my Coinbase account, I think you're on to something and I appreciate you taking the time to share how you did everything!

Asking a person who is getting paid to provide customer service if their establishment accepts bitcoin is *not* being "that guy," it's helping the ecosystem, even if in the most subtle way.

Hypothetically, if the US government wanted to kill Bitcoin once and for all, couldn't they invest $1B USD (just pulled that number out of nowhere--but however much it would cost them) to invest in the computing power to take &gt;50% of the blockchain? 
I'm not an expert on the CS side of bitcoin, so this is a genuine concern I have and am hoping someone can clear up?

It was great, I highly recommend it for budding entrepreneurs/redditors.

Third this, I've even chatted with support on their live chat and they were extremely helpful. Coinbase is one of the good ones, setting the standard for the industry!

Great to hear that one of the big 4 is progressive enough to seriously consider bitcoin, and I think you will find a rising demand for credible auditing in the industry in the wake of Mt Gox's collapse.

You really need to find something better to do than harass people about their link attribution strategies.
What if I told you that [backlinks are becoming almost useless as an SEO tactic...?](
I understand you want more transparency, but seriously, as someone mentioned...these news sites aren't trying to be the Mt. Gox/ Silk Road hacks and ruin peoples lives... they're trying to make a living, and you made your point clear enough that at this point you're just being a hater, and it's petty.

You lost all credibility as soon as you said "nobody bidding on the auction would turn around and sell their coins on an exchange, that would be *retarded*"

Even if "Ashley" did look this up--she should have disclosed that information to him rather than clowning him with "Ain't nobody got time for that" and all the other unprofessional shit she said.

Apparently dogecoin is actually pronounced "doggycoin," and that's supposedly coming from the inventor himself.

Won't lie, I read his post history and considered it for a second

What a shame that the NY Post lets stuff like this get published. The author used $350 as the price for BTC, purposely using the lowball Mt Gox price, when it's clear that Bitstamp/all other exchanges are in the $600s. 
This will be the type of article that people post in 5-10 years to make fun of the idiot who wrote it. Until then, hopefully the people reading the Post don't buy into this.

Damnit, I was just there! Spent $50 on drinks, would have loved to use bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:03:25
It does. I'd still micropay to read it without the hassle though.

You don't tell me what to do and when I can ask for a source or not, thanks.

Just want to give props to Eric Calouro at newsBTC, a site he started less than a month ago, for getting this huge exclusive story. Backlinks from Business Insider and all of the subsequent websites that report on this will boost newsBTC's traffic immensely.

Thanks for the reminder, needed to hear that.
