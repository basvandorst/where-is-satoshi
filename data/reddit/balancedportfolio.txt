Guys, Andreas has a number of books and also has a support page where you can donate some BTC.
I've done my bit to support this man, a little from all of us goes a long way: 
I promise to make this a bi-annual donation.

They are starting to take it more seriously. Bankers and banks are not stupid, they hire some of the most talented people on the planet. Ill make a bet that It's not just UBS that is doing this or coming to such conclusions.

I think this needs to be found out, sooner rather than later. Even if this is a fractional reserve system (Which could still work). Truth will out.

Wow lol mate it covers many coins but the main point is the BTC BCH debate. So it is very relevant.

+4 The only crypto being viewed as a serious investment vehicle right now is Bitcoin. BCC fans can move all they like, BTC will keep growing regardless.

Who agrees? This coup will fail.

In the UK you can buy gold 1oz coins directly from reputable sources with Bitcoin. Gold is not subject to VAT (20% tax) and the coins are not liable for capital gains tax. 
You do however pay a kind of tax with the margins which are around 10% flat.

Bitcoin is cheap again and scaling with batching and Segwit. It really works!

Why you lying bro

You are describing Bitcoin, It is the master ledger for value of the whole cryptocurrency space.
As it grows in users and the whole market in size, you will see a very strong currency.
Bitcoin this year has been remarkably strong.

This is to replace lost hash power from the B2X split. We already have more nodes but we also need to start mining to defend Bitcoin!
Long enough for the miners to come back

Bittylicious, i use it all the time. it's not cheap but it's reliable and very safe.
Higher limits on buying and selling than normal too.

When you reach a point you want to cash out, you wont have to. For Bitcoin to reach my goal it has to grow it's network, which means more users and merchants accepting.
 If Bitcoin become ubiquitous as a payment option, what would you cash it out for?
