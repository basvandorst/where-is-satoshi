A lot of the tech being touted as better then Bitcoin is actually just a band-aid on a gun shot wound. It won't scale to future demand but the LN will. Don't forget that we're dealing with a lot of money here, if Bitcoin rushes into a solution that doesn't work it'll have sever consequences on the entire market.

@_date: 2018-01-31 04:40:56
Just my take, i think this is due to a huge build up of FUD and weak handed new crypto fanatics going up against Wall Street for profit.  The market grew substantially and both the Blockchain and exchanges couldn't keep up which helped increase uncertainty (Bcash, high fees, wall street shorts, bans, frauds etc)  and decreased demand.  Wall Street profited by pushing prices even lower but their interest will fade with lower gains and governments will stop really caring again when public interest falls. The price will stabilize shortly and probably stay there for a while. I believe this because with the recent attention we also gained more Bitcoin enthusiasts buying for the tech and innovation, regardless of the price. Just like in the past, t'll keep the market going and with good news  (Lightning, more ETFs, major merchants etc) we'll see the price start to pump.  Hopefully Bitcoin and exchanges will be ready when interest grows again and with the amazing work being done on the Lightning Network it might be much sooner then later. Just Hodl.

It'll die down like in the past, people will stop talking about Bitcoin after the holidays and there will probably be a dip where many will say "See I told you it was a scam!" then we'll be back to normal for a bit and the price will slowly rise till it hits another psychological barrier (25K..50K..100K??) and another wave of new money will create another frenzy sometime next summer.

Institutional investors won't want to lose money either, if they bought at 15K sure they'll make money from the futures short or long but they'll still want it to hold it's value going forward. These are definitely crazy times..

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:30
It could be because there are almost 200,000 unconfirmed transactions in the Mempool right now

So basically
 1) Buy in weeks when the price is flat and sell when it gains momentum.
2) Google search trends and Twitter mentions can predict short term price trends.
Important mention: The tendency of government regulation and acceptance can be a game Changer.

The free market will eventually solve the issue. When price increases, more people will mine and mining difficulty will increase along with it. When it gets high enough only those using cheaper renewable energy or more efficient miners will be able to profit from mining.
The real underlying issue here is where we get our energy.

It's not going to be pretty with all the planned sell offs of BCH coming up (Bitmex, Gdax, Coinbase). It seems like alot of recent BCH volumes is coming from Korea but there has also been a lot of BTC purchases from there recently also. Looks like there's a Bitcoin craze wave  going on in Korea and some believe BCH will overtake BTC. I might be wrong but I don't think that's possible, BTC is now the backbone of so many projects and the gateway into cryptos. The upward pressure on the price is very strong because people just keep buying regardless of the price. Many argue about bitcoin as a store of value vs currency but I think, in a way, it's also become the entry point to a stock market.

He deserves it, no need for comparing to others, this guy set up a platform for others to commit crime. This has nothing to do with the ethics of drug laws or of arresting someone for facilitating crime and not committing it themselves. At the end of the day he made it much easier for others to break the law and get away with it, thousands of crimes were committed because of him and we'll never even know the depth of those crimes but thousands of people were probably frauded, some hurt due to bad drugs and there might even be  someone dead because of a hit taken out on that site.

It's not going to happen but BCH lost my respect when they lied about being the real bitcoin and I believe for that alone it should have been de-listed.

Those who keep proclaiming Bitcoin as dead aren't looking at the big picture. Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck what you think about it, traders come in and make price look so important but that's not at all what Bitcoin is about, it's just a consequence. What brought Bitcoin to the mainstream is a movement, it's about controlling your own money and that movement is pushing forward whether the finance guys include it in their plans or not.

Does anybody have advise on a good miner for a starter? 
I've been invested for a while but i'd like to get a better understanding of mining, I was thinking of starting with a small USB miner to learn but not sure which is best or if I should just jump right in and get a larger miner. I'm not so much doing this for a profit as much as a learning experience and to support BTC but it would be nice to be able to accumulate a little Bitcoin in the long run too.

100% understood but it's not a good thing to have people spending while it's still impractical, could drive some away. It's also a good thing to have lots of people save it while the price increases and then once there is mainstream vendor adoption there will be more people ready to start using it. Imagine going to a store and seeing they accept Bitcoin at close to 0$ fees, if you already own then you'll likely start spending slowly but if you don't own then the learning curve to spending is much longer. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:36:57
It's likely just because they couldn't complete proper KYC and labeled it as potential fraud so they are no longer going to do Fiat transfers for him for fear of breaking some law. The reason they're not letting him know the exact reason is because that's how financial institutions deal with potential fraud cases so as not to give the potential fraudsters any hint as to what raised flags.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:28:09
Although technically true you also need to remember that more saving=more future consumption. Right now saving at a bank is a little hard for the everyday person, savings and mutual fund returns  typically suck and don't even beat inflation. Now we have Bitcoin, which is deflationary and an easy store of value for the average Joe/Jane and keeping funds locked up is also very good for the price as it contributes to Bitcoins current scarcity. Not to mention there just aren't many vendors out there that accept Bitcoin easily now, lets wait till lightning adoption increases and merchants start using it, and they will because it reduces their costs, that is when Bitcoin will go mainstream.

Well the main player in the Cell phone industry at the time was Motorolla and their stock quadrupled from 1980 to 1990. Their stock price had another spectacular run in the 90's and increased more then 600%.

Yeah they seemed to be accumulating Bitcoin in September and October of 2016. I'm no expert at analyzing the blockchain but before then it seems to come from various different sellers/exchanges I assume as the wallets have numerous relatively small transactions. 
Coincidentally that was about when Segwit was introduced in the [Bitcoin core upgrade]( and when the scaling debate started taking off.
Edit: I wonder if it has anything to do with [Bakkt opening up deposits &amp; withdrawals today.]( Is there anyway to confirm if it was transfered into 1 of Bakkt's wallets?
Edit 2: Nope, most likely just someone cashing out their BCH and BSV. I wonder what they'll do with them now?
