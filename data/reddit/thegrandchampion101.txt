I made a bit too hahah! Looks like they are preparing for closure, they've offered a crazy 18% and their website is slowing down like crazy! 
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:05:51
Unlucky. How much did you pay for it?
@_date: 2016-01-17 10:51:43
I'm in the UK and don't have to pay for education till after 18, so its cool.

Thanks, bought my first 0.033 :D
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:19:51
Srsly. 😉 do you think it will bounce back now? Or drop further? I know no one knows the answer for sure but idk whether to buy or not :(
@_date: 2016-01-17 10:50:06
Ah really? I assumed they wanted photo ID to make sure your over 18. Good to know.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:14:31
just taking a look at this.. is it possible to send bitcoin to other wallet addresses with atombit?
@_date: 2016-01-17 10:54:15
Aren't we talking like, 5 cents a day?
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:22:00
I did buy some modafinil a few days ago at $760 :D
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:19:58
good luck op &lt;3
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:55:34
interesting perspective, thanks!

I expect Bitcoin to drop until America wakes up to a Brexit
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:26:08
oh my god, the chinese are driving it into the ground. SELL SELL SELL

I don't keep the Bitcoin in there, I buy it and send it to my actual wallet. And the servers would have to go down AND wipe, which would be catastrophic to everyone with an iPhone, I say it's highly unlikely anything would happen if you did keep Bitcoin in atombit, but each to their own.
@_date: 2016-06-24 11:31:21
See, I would use one of these more mainstream exchanges, but so many require valid ID! This destroys one of the main attractive components of Bitcoin, anonymity!
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:36:54
did you require ID to buy from circle?
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:18:31
Yep, I feel its going to drop off some more. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:45:17
Surely it will increase in value substantially, as we get closer to the halving. Although it may not double as such.
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:29:34
That "old white guy", is richer than you and more successful than you'll ever be. His advice spans all industries that have anything to do with buying and selling.
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:45:06
Now is definitely the best time to buy if you are fresh to the scene!
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:49:04
my biggest regret, was listening to friends saying it wouldn't take off. I was considering buying at $390. However, I guess this really is only the start of bitcoin, so I don't feel I have missed too badly ;D

@_date: 2016-06-24 14:58:15
Fixed now, but I tried to purchase Bitcoin, the app glitched then crashes, kicking me out of PayPal(the payment didn't go through) and when I go back into the app, it says I have to wait 24hrs to buy again, although no transaction happened. I wiped the cloud data as the wallet was empty and I was trying to take advantage of a drop in price. Went back on and it was throwing up an error. Talked to the support team and it was fixed promptly :) 
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:48:03
Ah that sucks. All i needed was a verified paypal account to buy from atombit.
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:05:40
Right, I had my suspicions. I wouldn't be surprised if I actually do get paid out for this $10. It would be clever move to increase trust in someone who obviously is cautious in how much they deposit. They would probably expect me to come back with $100 plus...
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:35:54
What do you do, to work for bitcoins? ��
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:19:20
If you have an iphone, get an app called ATOMBIT. Make sure you have a verified paypal and you're good to go!
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:17:08
I think we are good. The amount of Bitcoin you get is set at purchase I believe. I'm still pending but don't have id so can't use coinbase, first time using circle
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:29:46
If it hits $680, I think I'll buy.
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:50:33
Does the Coinbase app require ID to buy bitcoin? I'm currently using an app called ATOMBIT as it doesn't require ID, but I believe I'm probably getting less for my money than if I went with a big exchange. (P.S. I'm not a drug dealer, I'm just 17, lmao)
@_date: 2016-06-24 11:17:49
Although it seems I wasn't charged, I agree that it looks like they cancelled transactions to profit off the surge they knew was coming! Very disappointed. I'd be interested in knowing whether or not this happened to anyone else earlier!
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:00:27
No I didn't! :D
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:21:13
This might just be the bottom..
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:53:50
Yeah! You too! :)
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:37:57
Why has this been down-voted? lol. Best solution for buying bitcoin fast without ID checks and all that bs
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:49:40
That's brilliant! I could freelance my article writing skills :D
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:27:14
That will happen automatically yes. I assume you put your Bitcoin wallet address in the send field? Here is what mine says: sending  0.28464402 BTC (£150.00) to a Bitcoin address
@_date: 2016-06-24 11:18:29
I'm 16 so have no valid ID. Circle was my only option and I accidentally fucked up my ATOMBIT account. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:47:27
I love that. *nosedive* . Honestly though I'm 90 percent certain we will see a $850 bitcoin within the next 30 days. So you are good.

Good cause, but if you're targeting anywhere in the west you might have trouble. That domain name just looks fishy.
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:11:31
What an ugly domain name. Why didn't you pick a nice .com? Good that you're supporting bitcoin's growth though! :)

I understand that, 100%. However, it is my choice in the end what I do with my possessions. I'll be moving it out into a physical wallet soon. Until then, I'm asking what is more likely to stick around longer. Perfectly reasonable question I think.
