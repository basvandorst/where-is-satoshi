People assume that the current irritation of bitcoin is the final version and there won’t be any improvements. Almost like assuming windows 95 was going tho be the final edition, back in the 90s....bitcoin is software and it  will be updated! People are so short sighted!
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:59:44
Settle down, you don’t have to say nonsense just because you’re mad!
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:23:09
HOLD THE LINE BOYS!
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:27:18
This is just your opinion, man. It doesn’t mean anything!
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:46:17
Going back to fiat defeats the purpose!

You need to leave.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:52:50
Fuck yeah!

I'm starting to realize HODLING is hard and that's why it works. I would doubt it if it was easy!
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:25:32
It doesn’t sound like you know much!
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:12:04
Jesus dude, calm down!

It'll help...

The people that discount crypto assets as useless, don't know anything about the technology. I have yet to find anyone who is against it and understands it!
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:32:44
Yeah probably, but who the fuck knows.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:57:27
On Reddit for one week? You are here to troll my friend!
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:02:39
I have yet to meet someone who understands Crypto and doesn't like it!
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:57:08
Look, the trolls are back!
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:13:57
For some reason, I thought you posted the Titanic.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:26:54
Do your own research is my go to advice.
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:31:29
Dude, it’s up more than 1000% in a year, I’ll be fine!
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:49:33
Censorship resistance of bitcoin is our best chance!
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:39:13
Same here , brother! I just educate myself on the technology now!

when you are ready, you don't ever have to go back to USD!
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:43:59
People have been saying this for years!
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:42:27
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:17:26
We should let them know how we feel on google review!
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:37:17
Based on what I read, they rather watch crypto burn and don’t care about loosing some money! I mean they have all the money in the world! However, I HODL, we got this in the longer term!
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:21:47
You are assuming that we want to go back to USD, the plans are that we won't have to!
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:21:06
I recommend you look up the term proof of stake. What you describe above is called proof of work, which is energy intensive. POS needs a lot less energy!
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:05:14
Yeah, where did they all go?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:23:02
Price depends on supply and demand in a given time! So if they trade very large volumes in short time periods, then that may effect the price significantly, I think.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:17:31
Why so bitter? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:31:03
This is a joke, right?
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:59:38
Not shit Sherlock!

He is just a troll...
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:15:19
Quantitative easing devalues your money. So if you like losing value as time goes on, fiat is for you. I personally like to protect value.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:23:03
I believe in the blockchain technology and decentralized currency. However, one obstacle we need to overcome is how to pay taxes and keep governments off our back. 
Decentralized Crypto currency changes the power structure in a way that paying taxes is voluntary instead of compulsory! I’m sure there are ways to get around this, but I’m not sure what they are.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:51:12
Bitcoin is about being free, congratulations!
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:31:16
You are right, I just checked. You can buy $10, my bad!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:52:09
I can’t believe people are freaking out! This is the biggest disruption of financial industry, ever! Of course it’s not going to be a smooth ride, but it’s inevitable! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:58:33
We have no problem with monetary policy, we just have a problem with a dysfunctional monetary policy. Look at the US national debt at about $14T!! At the same time, we continually provide corporate welfare in terms of quantitative easing and massive tax loopholes.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:42:58
Trying to time the market never ends well. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:49:58
I think the minimum you can buy bitcoin is $110 now, I might be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:11:11

Yeah, if you’re magical money solves the double spending problem, I would consider it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:03:17
by devaluing our purchasing power, they are forced into borrowing more and more.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:32:04
I wish I had all the answers. However, I don't. What I'm trying to convey is that the fundamental shift that crypto and censorship resistance will cause.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:53:29
They are still only buying around $100, when they start buying close 10% of worth, that’s when it’s wide adoption!

@_date: 2017-12-27 01:24:39
It's an alternative that can't be manipulated by governments. In its current form, its a safer store of value, compared to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:27:30
13500 is the number I’m watching! If it come below that, it may correct down to 21 day moving average, which is around 7k.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:53:22
Hold the line men!
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:29:02
The incentives provided for mining is the censorship resistance. That’s is why it’s important to keep the decentralized system, which is inherently resistant to censorship.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:09:48
Blockchain is here to stay! Tokens or coins are needed to interact with it, so there is value there. Now, that value is speculative. However, remember bitcoin is global and the world has upwards of $80T in value. So, even if it only captures 5% of that, that’s still 4T. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:44:08
Too bad higher education will follow a completely different model in the future. I'm not sure if it'll be that costly.You can use the money for something else, I suppose!

Keep watching your movies, bro.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:00:16
By issuing quantitative easing they manipulate the money supply at the same time as increasing our national debt.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:56:25
Bitcoin is a software, and software can be upgraded, remember!

@_date: 2017-12-23 22:45:13
You're basically making long calls on each coin. If it any of them fails you lose $50/coin, but if any of them makes it, you make a lot of money. In terms of risk management, it's not that bad if you pick the right number of coins! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:28:04
I don't know how old you are or if you remember, but newspapers and magazines were significantly more influential then they are now. I mean, some of the richest and most powerful people were in the newspaper industry. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:44:51
You are completely forgetting the law of unintended consequences. The censorship resistance of crypto fundamentally changes the government-population relationship!
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:20:26
This is true as long as there is proper fiscal management. the US currently has $14 T in debt. This is an alarming number no matter how you look at it. The writing is on the wall, man!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:03:55
Hold the line, men!
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:42:18
I don’t think they are my enemy. I just think big business decides our monetary policy without meaningful public scrutiny or checks and balances.This happens because power is centralized! Decentralized currency will be resistant to this kind of manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:10:03
The strongest case against fiat is the governments themselves. Just look up the term "quantitative easing", lol. Or look at whats going on in Venezuela. Crypto is global and no one government can control it. Moreover, history shows that concerted efforts by the governments of the world have a very low chance of succeeding. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 12:45:34

Remeber how powerful the newspapers, magazines and centralized music industry was in the 90s? Where are they now? Internet disrupted them and they are a fraction of what they were.The same will happen to the banks in 15-20 years, maybe less.

please stay out!

Our purchasing powers now, compared to 10-20 years ago, is significantly lower. You can’t just look at short time frame and conclude that our purchasing powers is improving, you have to look at longer time frames.
