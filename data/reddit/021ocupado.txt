if coinbase can have over 15 mm users, this number seems to me just average, brazil is a huge country too, and even with all the problems, we still have a huge amount of world class households with a decent income, bigger  number than most european countries.. 
Meanwhile, we have two main problems: corruption and violence, but hey there is no heaven on earth

and if someone preffer to see bitcoin fail instead of let wall street participate, I will disagree with all my heart!
Wall Street will be gone one day, but this is far away into the future and the best btc can do now, and for a while, is slowly erode all sources of centralized power. while they deal with more urgent matters.
btc must be too big too fail before we deal with the system

meanwhile govs have worse problems in their hands, before dealing with magic internet money, they have crime drugs and hyperinflation, and relection!.
sizeable countries like venezuela and argentina, or turkey show their citizens in regular basis that the money problem is a everyday issue and people are looking for opportunities ... 
I fell that you have gov in high regard but they are not worth it! and strength without legitimacy is tiranny .. 
and by the way drugs are prohibited also and this dont stop a lot of ppl from trying ...

sorry, let me disagree
the alts race began last march after the SEC block one of the first ETF attempt, the price rose in antecipation, then btc dominance bleeded into alts, the btc price then lost some of the gains but still kept the momentum going, and the rest was the biggest bull run we all saw.
Now, since yesterday we saw another thing, 9 etf rejected in the same day, but the price is holding, and dominance is increasing... 
to me i think alts will bleed even more, ppl dont like to lose money and btc. 
btc inflation is the lowest in the market, so in the long run there is this factor also.
btc inflation 3,5% 
ethereum 10%
ripple I dont know 
Bitcoin Cash 3,5%
litecoin 8% 
the rest I dont care
so my advice is dont try to time the market, those who attempt this get rekt...
 but there are always a opportunity on the horizon to be seized! 
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:40:10

@_date: 2018-08-23 16:42:01
all the previous price moviments were nothing like this last.
since march 2017, happened ETF rejection (early march 2017) contentious fork (never happened also) (july 2017) wich lead to all time low in dominance.
this wont happen again for the first time, and dominance grew in last december due the bull run, now there is no bull run, and dominance is growing, and will grow until certain point... 
I think alt people will be desperate/ in panic before btc ppl. 
I wish you luck.

is a one time use expendable address, you can deposit multiple times but use only once, research the way you can do one safely on google, then make some of then, print, then test how to use with a little money, some like 5 to 10 usd, until you get confidence in how to use, then increase your holdings, if a ledger or a trezor is cheap enough you can buy one, but for me a paper wallet is the better way for you dont expend your holdings without thinking carefully! Research also about bip39 or 38 so you can encrypt your paper wallet with a passphrase so ppl dont steal from you easily

@_date: 2018-06-13 10:13:42
each time the dominance drops, stability increases, and that is good for the market and for btc itself...
even the universe had inflationary explosion at the begining, after that the velocity of expansion decreases absolutely and relatively 
my point is, this happened with btc, and will happen with all major crypto, the bigger they are, less dominance they will have, because ppl invest in new ones to get asymmetrical returns 
of course some get rekt on the way, as their risk also increases exponentially 
I may be wrong but that's how I see it.

the supply of fiat is infinite, thats what bitcoin is about, protect purchase power, like gold... some market fever in some point in history can distort things, but in the long run we should be able to keep our money's value AND productivity gains to us, and not be sneakly robbed by banks or govs

if you are above average in terms of computer knowledge you should look for a paper wallet, especially if you are in the acumulation phase.. then buy regularly (weekly, monthly or daily) for a while (2,3,4 years) so you can cost average, then HODL! for a while by then you help some noobs for good karma while you wait for your early retirement from the hamster wheel

what we are seeing now is like the big bang, the velocity of expansion will decrease with time, but for the first time in history we are able to conduct financial transactions and the average people can participate in one market 24x7 all over the world... 
I mean the potential for expansion is huge, but when this market evolve more in five years or ten we can see what we call classical market efficiency 
and by infinite supply of fiat, I would say credit and so on... look at the sp 500 or any money market

cost averaging is a decent strategy, but you can try to time the markets, it is your life, you are free.. but when ppl are consistent and have discipline, and stick to a plan in a given timeframe, price going down is simply a opportunity to accumulate
