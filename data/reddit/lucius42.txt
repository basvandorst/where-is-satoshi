Uhm, please explain. Because in my opinion, that's EXACTLY what putting money into bitcoin is. Speculating wildly.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:14:17
The differece is: you still have a roof over your head.
Buying crypto is not investing. It's speculating at best, gambling at worst.

So what was the correct thing to do? I mean I collected the japanese words, put them into the script instead of ??? and tried to run the script in Electrum console but nothing happened.

I'm sorry if I offended you by my previous post. It's just a very naive way to look at things, honestly.

Nobody ever lost money taking a profit. If you're a long-time holder and BTC is suddenly 80% of your assets, unloading some of it is the best advice one can receive.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:17:22


Can you please explain how bitcoin futures will enable that?
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:40:30
I see. Well, clearly, I can't run the script without installing MS Visual Studio and downloading some crypto assembly references because c# online compiler can't run it... so I'll probably leave it up to someone more qualified.

If I am somewhere in Africa and run out of local money, why would anyone accept USD? Because...
1) The US Army guarantees sovereignty of the USA well enough. No significant risk of the country being invaded and the USD being made worthless. Similarly, the US Army is used to promote US interests abroad, strenghtening the image of the USA as global hegemon (obviously, this last part is becoming less and less true but that's a whole different discussion).
2) All companies based in the USA pay taxes. There companies are world leaders in their field, improving the prestige of USA and contributing significantly to the federal budget. The production of these companies are tangible goods as well as digital goods. The state of the US economy says that these companies will not cease this production any time soon - they are doing great, making money. This is a guarantee of future production and future tax payment. This is good for USD.
3) Everything that the federal government holds has some real world value to someone. This also serves as a guarantee of USD. There are tangible assets owned by the country issuing those pieces of paper. It makes the country less likely to go down and bankrupt and not pay it's obligation.

You seem to be very young and inexperienced in the ways of finance.

Good article. Actually made me a little worried for the first time about the futures.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:39:20
I'm sorry you don't understand how this really works. But that's fine :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:43:40
Perhaps a better phrased question would be "what does Bitcoin derive real world value from"?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:15:07
I see I have wasted my keystrokes.

There's the one meme that's actually true in the world of (regular) investing. If your taxi driver starts to talk to you about investing, you know the ~~end~~ market correction is nigh...
Thinking that bitcoin is somehow different is naive at best.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:23:02


This is incorrect. USD is backed by the US Army, the production output of all US companies (via taxes) and by all Federal holdings (land, commodities, other currency...).
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:43:48
Honestly, that question is not well written. It does leave room for misinterpretation.

Restoring in Hidden Wallet also didn't work (although it did seem to accept the seed in Japanese, as opposed to Electrum)

I think they are strategically placed. One I don't understand is fucking Skalka - otherwise, I think the coverage is sufficient, maybe add IP Pavlova and Museum.

I did not figure this out. Coinhouse had no some very shitty translations (damn them Frenchies) and shitty verification requirements (eg. no PDFs, no ID cards...)

I have several EU bank accounts, some even USD denominated. But wiring that money would cost too much on various fees :(

For the last time: all the new money hitting crypto markets lately is not here because they believe in crypto, it's because they believe it'll make them rich. This is NOT a transition. This is a temporary bubble. It doesn't invalidate the idea but please, let's be realistic here. People are not adopting bitcoin thinking "I'll move all my assets here and use bitcoin to pay at Wallmart tomorrow".
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:34:40
Sell a portion of you crypto holdings, lock in some of those gains. Good job! Now take the extra money, get yourself &amp; your significant other a nice dinner, maybe a little gift. If you're alone, get that book you wanted or that computer upgrade you needed. Simply treat yourself :)
Bonus points for buying that for bitcoin directly without converting to fiat :)

Since we cannot make a Dyson sphere in our own solar system (because, you know, we kinda need the sun), the pre-requisite is interstellar travel. That ain't happening within the next 10 generations. So, yeah.

@_date: 2017-11-29 13:40:47
I'm not sure I understand your argument here. All I'm saying is, in my opinion, it's very naive to think "the transition" is here, right now.
