[80% of all dollars have trace amounts of cocaine on them](  So yes, the USD is huge in the drug trade. Disgustingly they also have dookie on them.
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has no cocaine and no dookie.
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency also has no nation state dictating currency games.  Onward!
Trump is probably just mad that [bitcoin cuts into some of his money laundering turf]( or he is short and distorting before the usual Trump Pump and Dump.

Moderation at first seems good, but eventually will overpower any subreddit and censor it to oblivion at the whim of minor utopic visions inside their own heads.  
The democracy of reddit is at stake, moderators are mini dictators. The upvote/downvote, report, and hiding should be all people need but power goes to people's heads.  
Most reddit moderators will go on to be the mini kings of their home owners associations and old people that complain alot.
