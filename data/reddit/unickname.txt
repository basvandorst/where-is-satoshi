I've heard that Kotlin is a 'fun' language that was designed to interoperate fully with Java (JVM, libraries, etc.). I would give it a try.
Scala also compiles to work on JVM, but Scala is not fun. Some features in Scala are for math geniuses, which turns some open-source packages and legacy-code into a black-boxes that simple developers are afraid to touch.

As soon as the miners will actively try to break bitcoin, like try to revert more than 2-3 blocks, or intentionally reject specific transactions despite having high fees, there will be a huge uproar, and then bitcoin will be forked to another coin with anti-ASIC features and maybe other features as well. Don't think that all the people who have bitcoin savings will actively go to an exchange and try to convert them to something else. They will simply update their apps to use "Bitcoin 2.0" with their current seeds and private-keys.
China simply tries to replace the USD as the world's standard money for international trade. It's that simple.

I've heard good things about Go and would want to learn it someday. I haven't heard good things about the others. Choosing a programming language is not a technical issue, it is mostly a sociological issue - how to bring self-learning programmers who are interested in esoteric programming languages, yet not scare them away with a language with no future, bad IDE, bad debugging tools and no open-source libraries to depend on.

Actually the Zionist movement, which called for the formation of a jewish state, was founded in 1897 when Hitler was 8 years old: [
By the end of the 19th century, it was clear that the entire world map is going to be separated to nation-states, and minorities that will not grab a piece of the cake fast will find it very hard to do it later.
The main reason was the pogroms against jews in 1881-1882 in parts of the Russian empire (today's Ukraine), by pro-Czar nationalists. In the same year 1897, other jews founded the anti-zionist General Jewish Labour Bund (which later on joined the Russian Social Democracy party which the Bolsheviks originated from).
Maybe without Hitler the UN wouldn't have agreed to the formation of Israel. Maybe without Hitler's obsession to kill jews, the jewish population in Israel was double and it would be easier for Israel to win its wars. Who knows.

I'm using a Trezor. For the initial setup and for firmware updates, I started my computer from an Ubuntu Live-CD. You don't need to override your existing operating system to access the Trezor, you can install the drivers in the Live Operating System, which runs from the RAM only, and everything will be gone after you restart the computer.
For spending and checking your balance, it doesn't really matter if your computer might be infected with malwares - every operation must be approved physically by clicking the Trezor button. A malware could trick you into copy-pasting wrong values, but for small payments it's not a big deal.
When I'll reach the point where I really care to keep my transaction history hidden, I will buy a new dedicated computer/phone and switch to a new passphrase.

The only difference between a cult and a religion is the number of members each has.
You don't need a massive revolution to bring down a bank. It's enough for the bank's customers to withdraw 10% of their savings in a single month. One bank will close its doors and ask for a bailout, customers of other banks will seek to withdraw their money and buy bitcoin, and the chain reaction will continue. Bitcoin is not only an ideology, it's an inevitable social-economic process. We're only waiting for a trigger - a corruption scandal, even in a relatively small bank.
Regarding Bitcoin's flaws, if the Lightning Network will not solve them, they can all be solved the old way - the central way. You can always have a small amount of bitcoin/money in a central organisation, like a credit-card company, which will deduct your funds at the end of every month. You won't give them control over your entire life savings, but only for a small amount to avoid fees. That's reasonable.
The major stronghold against Bitcoin will be the public sector. Countries will insist on paying the public-sector employees fixed salaries with the currency that the country prints. This will keep the market prices of every product attached to the nation's currency, and will keep Bitcoin very volatile. Bitcoin will rise to new highs in the next 2-3 years, as a safer store-of-value than banks, but it may take many more years to become a currency by which small business owners set their price tags to products and services.

I believe they will keep fighting it as much as they can. They don't want you to withdraw anything with deflationary value, only inflationary cash - because they know you wouldn't want to keep large amounts of it for a long time.
Can you buy gold in your bank? I mean literally a piece of gold, not an imaginary computer record. In my country I can't.  
However, I believe it will become more and more common in currency exchange stations - in every airport and every large train station. The competition between the ATMs will lead to lower fees. Americans and europeans don't feel the pain of other nationalities - for example, check the fees/exchange-rates for a South-Korean that flies to India...

Not as a currency, but as a long term investment asset.
They will make it illegal, or just highly taxed, to use bitcoin as a currency in the street, but they will allow and even encourage people to invest in Bitcoin through the banks and pension funds (yes I know, not your keys not your coins..., the government and the banks will say that letting ordinary citizens keep their private keys is not safe, blah blah blah)
The Chinese government is an expert in monitoring internet activity. Ordinary people will not take the risk of trading bitcoin “illegally” if they have the option to invest in Bitcoin through the bank. Bitcoin will not become a currency in China soon, but an alternative to gold.

The rich will always invest their money. The rich don't care about loosing $200k here and there. The big question is whether the middle class will be smart enough to organise together and invest their money together in order to reduce each others' risk. Right now the main reason middle-class people invest their money is because they know about inflation - so they give their money to the bank for a tiny profit. Unlike normal people who would lend their money for a fair interest, the banks lend "their" money for huge interest (plus, they are legally allowed to lend far more money than they actually have). By keeping your money in the bank, you are giving it to a bully.

OK, I'm giving up. NameSilo refused to block the entire list of addresses. They demanded that I'll follow their stupid bureaucratic process for each domain one by now. If you want to help, right now the addresses redirect to bitabbress(dot)org, so you need to enter [ report the address - Real Website: bitaddress(dot)org, Phishing Website: bitabbress(dot)org, and attach a screenshot of bitabbress(dot)org showing the domain name in the address bar.
After a day or so NameSilo will block this one specific domain, and the scammer will redirect all the other domains in the list to a new one (that looks like bitaddress(dot)org with a spelling mistake). Repeat the process \~146 times and the scammer will be blocked.
I truly suspect that NameSilo are making nice money from this domain hoarder, so they don't want to block him and are only doing the minimum required by law. I tried to "threat" that I will contact the police, but they politely ignored my request. I'm not an American and don't live in the USA, so I'm not going to spend my time and money on international phone calls. If you live in the USA, please help the future of Bitcoin by calling NameSilo. If you know a lawyer who knows how to handle this more efficiently, please ask for a favour.
The more Bitcoin noobs will be scammed today, the slower Bitcoin will be adopted by the masses in the future. In my opinion, fighting these phishing scammers today is even more important than developing another crypto-app or another crypto-gadget.

Private key generates a Public key (in a mathematical process called asymmetric cryptography).
Public key generates an Address (in a mathematical process called hash-function).
Both of the procedures are very hard to "reverse", i.e. finding out the public-key from an address, or finding the private-key from a public-key.
When you sign a transaction to send coins from an address, you reveal the Public-Key to the world, so you loose one of the cryptographic protection mechanisms.
Nobody knows how to break a-symmetric encryption (not any time in the near future, but maybe someday 20 years from quantum computers could now). Nobody knows how to break the bitcoin's hash-function, not even with theoretical quantum computers. If some computers will be able to break asymmetric cryptography, and you publish a transaction that spends \*all\* the coins from an address (i.e. publish the public-key), a hacker could break private-key from the public-key and forge his own transaction (i.e. from the address to the hacker's address) - but he will need to do it very very fast because the original transaction is being written to the blockchain. If you don't spend all the coins, or if you send more coins to the address that you spent from in the past, the hacker will have a lot of time to forge a transaction.
Also, reusing an address makes your transactions more traceable.
Don't confuse a single private key with a "master private key" (a.k.a mnemonic phrase). A master-private-key can generate lots of single private-keys. As long as you generated the master-private-key properly, If you use one single private-key (i.e. spent from one address), it's completely ok to use a second private-key later in the future (spend from a different address). Most software &amp; hardware wallets manage the spending automatically and don't leave any funds on an address that you spent from (they generate a new address for the funds left). You just need to make sure that you don't receive more coins to an address that you spent from.

China is experiencing a huge economic growth and is not involved directly in wars as far as I know. The problem with wars of democratic countries is that it diverts the political debate. People vote to the leader who they think best to manage the war, and ignore the economic debate.

Conspiracy Theory: China is buying Bitcoin and will brand it as "better than gold" for everybody who doesn't like Fiat money or the stock exchange, and for nations that want to keep reserves.
The USA has 8133 metric tons of gold holdings, and the Gold's share of forex reserves is 76%.
China has only 1936 metric tons of gold holdings, and 2.8% of Gold's share of forex reserves.
Right now the total worth of Gold in the world is over 30 times more than the total worth of all Bitcoin. If China's plan will work, Bitcoin price will rise by 2000% and gold will drop by 66%. This is how China will win the trade war in the next 2-3 years.
Donald Trump loves gold. It's his symbol. He won't sell it on time, he won't replace America's gold reserves with Bitcoin reserves as he should.
The Chinese government is also scared from bitcoin as we've seen in the HK protests. And they should be scared for good reasons. If you can't fight them, buy them... China wants to be able to destabilise the Bitcoin price in times of protests.

Instead of printing money, countries could make the following rules:
1. Property tax for unused “money” (money/gold that is stashed in your home and not invested and lended to others)
2. The salary of all employees reduces by 1% every year unless they make a new contract with their boss (including minimum wage).
The funny thing is that this is exactly what printing money is! But if you pass these laws literally, the people will riot. If you make property tax on cash, why not make property tax on private golf courses and yachts? Why does the minimum wage has to drop every year by default?

I respect your comments, but as an Israeli and jewish (non-religious) and a grandchild of holocaust survivors I feel very sensitive about the Rothschild comment. Yes I know that you did not blame the entire jewish people, but this idea crossed in the minds of those who read what you wrote. In fact, one of the reasons that I started to buy bitcoin is that one day antisemite leaders might take over parts of the western world again and blame us jews for all of the world's atrocities, or for the actions for some specific jews. You could say that my paranoia is that someday paranoids will take over the world.
The Rothschild family does not control every bank but three. This is nonsense. I will not google "Does the Rothschild family control every bank but three?" because obviously I will hit some weird youtube channels. Yes I know that the Rothschild family made tons of money from at least one war (don't remember which) - they had intel about the actual amount of forces that one nation had and lend them money, even though the rest of the world was sure that the other nation would win the war. Also one of the Rothschild members was an enthusiastic zionist, and donated a lot of money to buy lands from the arabs who lived in Israel (which was called Palestine back then, when it was ruled by the ottomans or Great Britain). You really think that the Swiss banks are controlled by the Rothschilds? Including the ones that worked with the Nazis? If you like conspiracy theories, many people who worked in the death camps in Poland tell that the soldiers instructed them to pull out gold teeth from the corpses. Many here believe that these gold teeth ended up in Swiss banks. What about banks in China? Africa? The Arab world? All but 3?
If you wonder why some jews end up in high positions of power and money, I have my own theory and we can continue this conversation. But we're definitely not all rich, and not all united. You're welcome to visit the poor neighbourhoods of Jerusalem and see in your own eyes where all the poor jews end up.
By the way, I was told that the entire family tree of the Rothschild family (or almost all of them) have converted to christianity and married non-jews. Not that there is anything good or bad about that, but it was easier to preserve our culture when antisemitism was common and nobody wanted to marry a jew.
Have a nice day.
