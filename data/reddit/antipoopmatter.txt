If I donate $100 to an address associated with the KKK, confidential transactions only hides the amount. I'm still permanently linked to the KKK and can have future transactions blocked. 
Confidential transactions will be a great step for BTC if implemented but it doesn't solve the fungibility problem.

Blocked is the wrong word. I think I meant rejected by a vendor or the transaction is ignored by miners due to the origin of the coins.
I'm hoping you're right and CT and CoinJoin resolve the issue but I'm pessimistic due to block chain analytic companies. Either way there is some serious progress being made in the fight for fungibility.

That's a good point. For a lot of people that will be enough but I think we underestimate just how smart the blockchain tracking software is going to become.
Until we see privacy baked into the core protocol, I don't see bitcoin becoming 100% fungibile.

It's a good question. At this point I'm not so sure it should be anonymous because it kind of breaks the social contract. Bitcoin has never been anonymous and thats not a bad thing. If anything, the market cap is an indication of just how valuable a distributed public ledger is.
Bitcoin is a great transparent ledger but if you want fungibility, it has to be baked in at the protocol level.

I'd recommend spending some time looking into bitcoins hashing algorithm. Servers and bandwidth aren't indicative of mining capability and you most likely will be earning dust.
Will probably get downvoted for recommending this but you may want to look into mining altcoins to dump for BTC. With your hardware your best bet is an alt with a more cpu friendly mining algo.
Good luck with everything!
