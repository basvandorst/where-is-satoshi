For that I would suggest something a bit more innovative in your marketing plan.  I'm not sure if there is an online market for music that uses bitcoins, but that may be a possible avenue.  I doubt you'll have much luck posting a song online and just asking for bitcoins in return.

Your parents are, sadly, doing the right thing.  They are protecting you from putting 50% of your liquid assets into bitcoin which you may lose very easily.
My advice would be to consider a much smaller amount.  Say instead of 2 bitcoins, how about 0.5 bitcoins?  The risk is much smaller this way and could make more sense to your parents.

The logic is actually better than that:
    1 - Enter bidding registration for $200k - refundable if unsuccessful.
    2 - Bid low.
    3 - Win bid - sell coins immediately that you already have (not the ones you are buying).
    4 - Receive discounted coins from USMS a few days later.
    5 - Profit!
If you fail to win, there's no cost to you, just that your $200k was on hold for a couple of weeks at most.   This was always an obvious tactic for easy profit with very little risk so I am not surprised multiple bidders went this route - Pantera, Secondmarket, Alex Waters (coinvalidation), Josh Jones (Dreamhost) so far have tried and failed, but lost nothing in the process.

It's part the adoption process. More options are coming aboard for accepting Bitcoin. As that happens more businesses will implement their own systems to avoid fees. That's possible with Bitcoin, but not with credit cards and other payment systems.

I never mentioned increasing the value of anyones holdings.  My logic for adding more actors to the ecosystem is to support the ecosystem generally.  More businesses accepting bitcoin means more possibility of people getting paid in bitcoin, and vendors doing B2B transactions in bitcoin.  This in turn will lower payment friction and costs for businesses, which currently have few options but to use expensive credit card payment processors and wire transfer processes.
If you're one of the people that trades bitcoins only hoping to make profits, then you likely won't understand what the rest of us are trying to achieve with bitcoin.

Explaining bitcoin to people is difficult.  I have good results with this to start:
"Bitcoin is a protocol; a public transaction log or audit trail of every bitcoin transaction / transfer / payment.  Each transaction is a new entry in that log, which is verified by users of the network.  This verification and confirmation process is rewarded every 10 minutes by the creation of new bitcoins - up to the 21 million total limit.  The verification process is commonly referred as 'bitcoin mining'."

I would prefer just to enter the number of bitcoins into mint manually, and have it provide the equivalent USD value back to me.  This would make it easy to track as part of my finances.
The killer feature would be to add bitcoin addresses.  This way I could actually track my transactions like everything else in mint without having to give up details about coinbase accounts.
Side note - don't store your bitcoins with coinbase because online wallets are not secure.

Whenever I see a company call themselves 'First' something it makes me puke a little on their logo.  Seems to be an American thing that banks do.

Why are you assuming it was a dutch auction style?  I don't see any reference to that on the US Marshals site.  They do say that the highest bid wins, but that they don't necessarily accept any bid.

I completely agree with you.  But this person wants advice on how to convince their parents, and lowering their exposure to risk seems like an option in that conversation with a protective father.

Yes, I would take the 10k, you can't reverse the transaction anyway.

This depends on settings in the client.  Multibit can be set to send the change back to the same address.  I also think the android client does this.
But to answer the second part of your question - no.  Each address and private key is a unique pair.  So when your client generates a new bitcoin address, it also creates a new private key which you need to make sure you back up.
Check the settings in your client to see what it's doing.

I have recently bought things from overstock.com, bitcoinstore.com, and steamloader.com.  I spend bitcoin every few days at a local cafe in my town, and I have paid a few debts to people by offering bitcoin over the last year.  I have also sold people bitcoin, and gifted people bitcoin.
There are a few other places around the town where I live that accept bitcoin, but I haven't yet had the need to use them. (wine tasting, web-design, custom electronics, and a law firm)
The one thing I haven't done is try to day-trade bitcoin to get-rich-quick.  :)

That's the same one I saw.  It is clearly not asking to ban anything, just stop it harming hard-working Americans.  
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:49:14
Agreed.  The term 'transaction log' tends to ring a bell with techies, and prompts them to ask meaningful questions.  The term 'audit trail' does the same for most other people with a basic awareness of accounting, commerce, finance, or even cashiers in retail etc.
My goal is to give the audience a nugget of understanding from which to build their knowledge.
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:52:50
This would certainly be an interesting one to try and change.  Since there are people willing to put some pretty badly thought out billboards around the US, it's not much of a stretch to think they might fund an ad at the superbowl too.

You can buy just about anything with bitcoin.  But you're right about the relative difficulty of obtaining bitcoin.  This is steadily getting better, and is certainly part of the 'user interface moment' that he mentions multiple times.
The kind of post user interface moment you could imagine would be that every atm dispenses BTC, and every retailer and service provider accepts it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:33:04
You do not explain in your post why you think this is a major problem.  What time is acceptable for you?  What issues do you think are created by the current system that cause problems?

It doesn't matter whether this is a bubble or not.  Bitcoin adoption is increasing, bitcoin awareness is increasing.  That's great whatever the exchange rate is.  People 'trading' in bitcoin and the least important participants in this game.  Businesses accepting are important.  People spending it are important.  New innovations based on the bitcoin protocol are important.  Investing to get rich later - not really important.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:49:54
I don't think it changes that you simply need to trust and be honest with your spouse.  For me at least, that is what defines marriage.  So even if my significant other were more or less risk averse than me, I would want to discuss everything with them and make decisions together.
Plus, I find your assertion that women are somehow fundamentally different in risk assessment to be an interesting one.  Do you have any citations for that?

The sad thing about printed money, and this applies to bitcoin paper wallets too, is they all gravitate towards the same boring designs and layout.  Money is instantly recognizable all over the globe as a result.  But very boring at the same time.

I agree with you here.  They likely have very small overheads that can be covered by some advertising, or out of pocket expenses.  This is the beauty of it.  None of the data is encumbered by restrictive licenses at this point so anyone can just access the API and start their own little website which displays the chart in realtime.

The media will soon stop looking at the exchange rate for bitcoins and start measuring the volume of commerce being conducted.  That day will hopefully reveal a big number.  If it is high, bitcoin will do well.

It will be interesting to see what mainstream sites decide to do when they start adding similar charts for bitcoin.  At the moment there are no mainstream financial data providers that offer bitcoin feeds so it's a clean slate.
Here's hoping they at least offer the same options we all get for free already.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:29:43
It does seem like a pointless billboard.  My guess is this is still the self-indulgent musings of someone with too much money to throw around.  Next time they need to pay an advertising company to help them.

What exactly are the headaches of starting an exchange?  All the failures I have seen to date are things I would expect other businesses that were run by incompetent management to to encounter.
1 - Security is hard.
2 - Not complying with regulations.
3 - Not making sure your bank is supportive of your business model in advance.
Coinbase are essentially a slow motion exchange, and they are managing just fine.
