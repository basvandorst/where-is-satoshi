Exactly. The blockchain is public. If you want to stop someone from examining it...you would have to turn off the Internets.
EDIT: If governments don't already have this in place, then it will be very soon. It is very easy for a group of programmers to analyze and trace ALL addresses back to the point in which they were mined. Don't be so naive to think this isn't this case.

How will you prove to the potential investors that you don't secretly know the private key to their cold storage wallet? I'm genuinely curious.

Have another paper wallet ready. Move all of paper wallet into hot wallet, move all of hot wallet except what you want to keep, back into the new paper wallet.

Mine says the same. I think they did that for everyone about 22 hours ago.

I was thinking it would be the average price, because everyone is buying bitcoins at a slightly different price, which is dependent on what that person is selling them for. Is that wrong?

What is the actual driving force that causes BTC's valuation to fluctuate?

I opened my account 3 years ago and just remembered it. Goodbye.

Good to hear. I was just curious.
Congrats on your job.

So the exchanges are showing the average price that people are buying and selling bitcoins?

I was being sincere actually. There were down for a bit today, but my orders went through when things came back online.
