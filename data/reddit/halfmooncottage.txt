Yearly July dip will take us to 7k.
I expect fluctuation between 7-10k before we hit the early October madness.
October - December are going to be one hell of a ride

I didn't even include decorations in the budget you fucking numbskull
I gave basic budget requirements and it came out to $4500/month which is conservative
Unless you want to be alone for the rest of your life, which it sounds like you will be, a budget for a family of 3 people is very reasonable

It is not limited by law as we have seen they can poof 1 trillion dollars out of thin air whenever they want to or deem it necessary. 
And to use your example, it's no different than if I wrote "20 dingers" on a piece of paper and then went around trying to buy stuff with my newly minted 20 dingers. It doesn't work like that. 
However, if my dingers have a unique trait that make them valuable to society for transacting purposes, then if enough people are incentivized and interested they do hold value. If I can then limit the supply of dingers in a way that nobody can ever make more than say, 21 million of them, now "infinite supply" becomes "limited supply".
@_date: 2019-11-08 18:47:06
I don't see what the law has to do with it - regardless of who is "authorized", they can print an infinite amount of it.
@_date: 2019-11-08 06:19:28
This is just not true though, the British pound has infinite supply and it's been around for 1200 years.
Anybody can cut a piece of paper and write "20" on it, so technically all money is infinite supply? but that doesn't mean you are actually creating a new currency by doing so.
People have to accept the currency and perceive it as valuable, and if that stays true for long enough, then the inherit limited supply within those successful networks will do the opposite of what you describe.

$11k USD is not much to be excited about. Maybe it is when you’re just leaving school, but for many of us that’s like 2 months of bills and food

You kept acting like decorations were a budge breaker and I didn't even include them in the budget lol... fuck off with your bullshit man.
$11k MIGHT get this guy through 6 months with no car lol... it's not a good financial plan stop acting like it is
OP will be what, 25 years old when he comes back? Unless he plans on being alone he probably needs to realize how far $11k will actually get him. Not very far.

Rent and inflated housing market in a rapidly inflating economy. 
This is a fairly normal monthly budget for a small family here (2 parents, 1 kid):
$2500 rent
$250 utilities, internet, etc
$400 car payment (or 2x $200)
$150 gas
$500 food 
$150 family phone plan
$500 student loans 
So that’s $4,500 / month basically and that’s just the basics without any entertainment, sports equipment, toiletries, clothing, pet food or pet supplies, car maintenance, furniture, decorations, holidays, etc... 
$11,000 doesn’t last long here.

$2500 rent in California is below average really. And a mortgage with insurance would typically be even more. 
California is just very expensive, that is the truth. But there is a ton of people living here on this kind of budget it’s not spending money on “crap”.
Cars require maintenance I don’t know where you think you can get a car and just change a light lol. Tires, oil, insurance, registration, mechanical fixes... these are payments that get made on top of the car payment.
If dude comes back with $11k and no car how is he going to get around? 
The budget I listed is very reasonable if not under the average here.

I mean to be fair, 25B x 1,000 = 25T, so it's technically less than &lt;1000x
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:24:19
Help me understand your math...
You are saying:
25B x 21975 = 22T ???
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:32:24
\&gt;  How many 25B do you fit inside 22T? Thousands
Nah, man.
You can fit exactly **880**.
880 x 25B = 22T

What a stupid thread, there's a lot of reasons for the blockchain other than BTC.
I need something other than BTC because it takes 10+ minutes to send a BTC transaction and also I don't want to pay fees every time I make a tx.
BTC is a good store of value but as a currency it is dog poop
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:57:19
No no you have it all wrong
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:39:06
Because they don't take 10 minutes to process a transaction
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:41:53
Obviously I have. Good luck getting 10,000 new people prepped for lightning network tx. 
And you'd still pay a fee on each one.

We need to cleanse our financial chakrahs of the inflationary toxins of society, the first thing we should do is convert BTC to essential oils and meditate for the enlightenment of the greater fools. Only then can we manifest the moon memes into the creative expression of metaphysical evolution.
Everybody knows this.

There are several good options that won't run into that problem
@_date: 2019-04-12 04:36:25
There are certain options we can't really discuss here that are built to avoid those problems, that's all I'll say. 
The exchange issue is an issue now that is true but eventually we will hopefully see more fiat on ramps directly to other options. Binance seems very close.
@_date: 2019-04-20 19:58:01
Two things... first, that hasn't happened, so let me know when it does, I'll be happy to use BTC that way.
Second, why do you think I'm talking about "fake copy coins" are you unaware that actually legitimate decentralized networks exist besides bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:12:52
TBH the best way to do this is to convert into a feeless crypto before sending. 
You can either pay 10,000 fees, or you can pay zero fees. 
Sending tiny payments to 10,000 people is definitely not a BTC strength
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:59:38
There is a definitive non-zero number of people who actually need BTC / crypto currency and that number will always be a non-zero value. I feel safe in my assumptions that new money will always be entering the market as a result of basic needs. 
The cat is out of the bag. 2017 was just an extreme overreach way too quickly. The actually market cap that was reached ~$900B is just a small taste of the true long-term value of this asset class when you think decades or centuries ahead.

There will be a little dip in July like always... question is that dip from $8k to $6k or $12k to $10k.

How did people lose 50% if the price is now $7,900?
You mean impatience cost people 50% if they sold? That's a much different statement.
