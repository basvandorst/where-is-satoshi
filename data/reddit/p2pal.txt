For the sake of newbies and others who should know, but don't (or aren't sure they do), can someone say how to generate a virgin address in a few common places, such as the popular BTC exchanges and wallets? Thks.

He is such a flip-flopper: (1) In 2014, he said it was going to $1 million (  ); (2) In 2017, he says he no longer believed it was a store of value and was selling out (  ); (3) Now he's back in. That said, I respect that he finally realized the error of his 2017 position and is back in. Now to see if/when is $1 million milestone is crossed.

I am the owner of P2Pal.com and would like to put it to use for something having to do with Bitcoin.  Before you knock the "P2P" name, know that the richest man in the world, Bill Gates, prefers that term.  See Bill walking through his vision for the future of “P2P” money here:  (note the slide that comes up after a few seconds).  Please get in touch if you want to explore possible collaboration of some kind.  Thanks.

Instead of questioning how Bitcoin can be used to circumvent capital controls, we need to asking why we should be restricted from moving our money at all. Fuck that. If someone has money they acquired through legal means, they should be able to easily move it wherever they want, whenever they want. And if the problem with that is that then everybody would take their money out of country X, then maybe the problem problem is with country X, not the people who want to take their money out of their. Maybe country X needs to change so it doesn't "need" capital controls.

Motivated coin stealers would go there. Heck, maybe there is already a bounty on his head. "Bring us Satoshi and you will get x% of the coins we get him to cough up." It's an amazing irony and dilemma. A story for the ages.

That headlines is kind of what's in the way of mass adoption and of people feeling comfortable holding a "lot" of money in BTC. Everyone's definition of a "lot" is different, but there comes a point for every HODLer that they sell some to get down to where they can sleep at night and/or do something like put all their Bitcoin in cold storage via sharded private keys in 12 separate safety deposit boxes across the country, then smashed the computer, router, and printer with a sledgehammer.

That wasn't a dip.... not by a long shot.

Tell us when you sell (because that will be the time to buy). Not saying that to be a dick, it's just how the psychology of markets work (stocks, cryptos, tulips, everything).

You can be certain if you buy from reputable seller AND test it. Google for "gold testing kits" or "electronic gold testing" devices.

You got it backwards, friend: It's central banking that CAUSES the epic capital misallocations and tremendous, booms and busts. They don't fix anything. They just postpone inevitable things and turn mole hills into mountains, at the same time extracting capital from the 99% and allocating it to the 1%. It's socialism for the rich that central banks provide.

It's a store of speculative thing and and store-of-value thing before it's a give-johnny-his-change thing.

It actually still is a great sell signal. Worked like a charm at the latest peak in all the cryptos. My taxi drivers and friends who had never shown interest before were all over me. It marked the exact top. Now they are silent. When they start coming back crying or angry or otherwise emotional on the other end, it will be time to buy. Not yet, though. Been through this before. It ain't over, folks. You're still in the hope phase if you think it is. Won't end until you feel really sick and just give up in disgust. Not all of you, but most. It's a right of passage, so don't despair. It will make you stronger in the long run.

What was the timing of that, is what matters, usually.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:25:50
This time it took you eight months. How long will it take you next time. If there is a next time, of course, I mean for the price of Bitcoin to take a moonshot and then retrench far enough and long enough that you turn away and just HODL.

Of course it rose in dollar terms, that is what dollar devaluation looks like, other things go up relative to the value of the dollar. Put another way, the dollar becomes worth less. And eventually, worthless.
