what the fuck is this sentence? and all it takes to be a conspiracy theorist is to hear the official media/govt story and decide that it sounds like bullshit, usually because the evidence doesn't support it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:30:46
I use GDAX and Binance. On GDAX it literally will not let you place a buy order above market price, and on Binance if I place an order above the lowest sale price, it will buy at the lowest sale price first. 
And if you could buy above the lowest sale price, then the lowest sale price wouldn't change so neither would the market price??

I paid off my credit card debt with gains earned from cryptos that I bought with my credit card. YMMV
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:43:32
yea this is important. Once I made $500 day trading after like 2-3 hours. Then I left to get a fucking sandwich come back 15 minutes later and I'm only up $100 now. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:14:06
Lack of evidence can definitely be evidence of the existence of a conspiracy. It is not, however, evidence of any particular conspiracy or towards any particular theory. It's like if we got some transmission from space that was clearly from intelligent life. THe nutjobs would somehow try to say that its evidence that they look like X and have Y intentions etc. No, it is simply evidence that they exist, but we still know nothing about them.

uhhh then how will I buy?

@_date: 2018-01-11 16:24:42
this is fucking dumb. it leads to an underlying assumption that conspiracies can't happen which is far more insane and dangerous than being a skeptic.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:32:49
Part of the major issue with the outlook is that it is very vulnerable to manipulation. You can't know exactly how skeptical is the appropriate amount, but we can imagine the worst case scenarios and those involve us erring on the side of blind trust rather than skepticism. 
There is unhealthy and unwarranted skepticism but like most things you do not argue against a position's idiots if you are arguing in good faith.

its really easy to create a paper wallet and send your coins from the exchange to your wallet and then they are safe as long as you have the paper.

in this case its because they are investing money they can't afford to lose.

more people selling "at market price" than buying.
if nobody ever sold/bought at market price, the price would literally never move.

Stadiums are often named after banks. Wells Fargo Arena. US Bank Stadium. etc.

I cashed out at 17k because I expect this big correction, at which point I will re-buy!
Question is though.... how low does the dip go? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:35:36
yes, it is speculation, but it is not 100% guessing game. smart people are more likely to guess correctly and play their hand well and be rewarded while, more importantly, mitigating risks.
to lose a bunch of money at this game you've got to be a moron.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:34:46
exactly. the problem isn't that people don't adopt enough, the problem is that people don't get their dog spayed or neutered and we end up tons of unwanted dogs. 
if you don't harass people who DON'T own a dog about it, then don't harass someone who does and takes good care of it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:28
you're so wrong in so many ways. I work harder and smarter than you ever could, and I already cashed out the equivalent of my initial investment so even if bitcoin goes to $0 I've lost nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:28:41
lol I just randomly happened across an article yesterday where a guy sold his gambling website for over 126,000 bitcoin a few years back. 
that's over $2billion now if he kept it and I wasn't even looking for examples.  just for a website.

im still getting the message that bitcoin sales have been disabled.
annnnd it crashed again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:37:42


not convinced of this either. when you sell on coinbase it sells at a price lower than what coinbase lists as current price. how can I be convinced they aren't taking the difference.

@_date: 2017-12-19 14:33:06
getting your dog spayed or neutered is more important. if everyone did this responsibly the shelters would almost all close within a decade.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:58:15
Hmmm if you buy the bitcoin with your own cash then you have to pay capital gains tax on your profits if you ever cash out, right? 
But if your boss pays income tax before giving you your net pay in bitcoin, then would those gains still be subject to capital gains tax when you withdraw? 
I mean... I guess it would right? If so then I'm not really sure why I'd want to be paid in bitcoins when like you said I could just buy the coin with my paycheck if that's what I wanted to do. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:02:44
i sold some last thursday and already received the cash in my bank account, but the transaction still says "pending" on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:53:55
would you say then that bitcoin's value for the foreseeable future then is as an investment rather than a currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:21:41
how does this sentence apply to bitcoin any differently than the stock market? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:54:58
hold your horses boys and girls, don't be surprised if it drops down to 200-300k subscribers over night. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:28:36
bitcoin investors are different than your average panic-seller in the stock marker. by a lot. they behave very differently. traditional expectations are kind of out the window nobody knows wtf is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:22
the price is probably dropping right now while coinbase prevents people from selling high so that it's fiat backers don't lose out.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:44:07
what a dumb comment
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:51:46
It will last. and is a bubble as well. they are not mutually exclusive. Look at the dot-com bubble in 2000. Yes, it was a bubble and it crashed, but it recovered much more stabilized and steady growth ever since. 
Bubbles are good for new technology because the frenzy drives the creation of the infrastructure upon which it will recover after it crashes. Bubbles just happen when there is a lot of excitement - it isn't a reflection on the market other than to say it is exciting.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:52:33
bitcoin cash just launched on coinbase so yea that's going to be a dip
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:57:03
that sucks I was just about to buy the Ethereum dip at $465 and it went down..... now ETH is back to 480...

@_date: 2017-12-13 19:59:06
I think it is very unwise to *not* have something invested in crypto right now.
For the highly risk-averse, watch the markets for a few days and look at their history. Look at the sell/buy orders and it is pretty easy to find a spot where it's going to dip temporarily sometime soon (like for a few minutes or even seconds). Place a small order for just above the other 'dip' prices. Could even just be $100 for the average Joe on reddit. 
WIth the trends we've currently seen this year and where we are now, there is an extremely high chance that your value will double within 1 week to 1 month, at which point you take out half your initial investment. Now if everything crashes by 75% you still break even. 
If the money hasn't doubled within 2 months, take it out. You lose a few bucks.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:48:52
it looked that way because the way the media pushed the coverage and warped the original idea. 
the idea got morphed too easily because they were leaderless, but just because it got off topic doesn't change what started it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:55:18
I'm not sure if you understand what NiceHash is. It's got nothing to do with investing in crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:30:01
sort of. you don't write off losses of bitcoin, you write off losses of dollars. the gains/losses only apply to the fiat you receive when you sell. the IRS isn't taxing your crypto, it's taxing your dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:35
yea but once all bitcoin are mined if they were 100 million each that would be something like 2 QUADRILLION dollars market cap, which is like 8x the total amount of money in the entire world.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:35:13
right I was just clarifying for anyone else reading that the IRS doesn't tax bitcoin they tax income.

the governments of the world including the US government are treacherous cunts. and assange is against them. 
the CIA and NSA abusing citizens rights and lying to the public and assange exposes a lot of that? well then he got targeted by the establishment which includes hillary. hillary wanted him dead for exposing US govt lies. but since he didn't support her in the election he's a russian traitor ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:42:11
in my opinion the government should have bailed out the people who owed money on their mortgages. then the banks would get indirectly bailed out, the people keep their homes, etc. 
but no lets give the money directly to the banks AND foreclose on everyone and kick them out of their homes. *Great* idea.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:25:21


Well here is one of the major ways crypto is different than traditional investment. Crypto holders are used to LOTS of volatility. They don't abandoned ship over a 30% drop. That's just a normal day lol. In fact, if bitcoin drops to 10k right now many, perhaps most of those people will be scrambling to buy low. 
I think bitcoin will eventually in the future stabilize/land around 100k. If that is true then it's not even a bubble yet until it's over 100k. It may go up to 1 million then crash 90% down to 100k where it stabilizes.
it's all speculation but if you're applying traditional stock behavior then you're speculating wrong imo
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:46:40
Assange was pro-Trump by default because he was working against hillary who wanted him dead. he has no loyalty to trump or russia or anyone but himself.

coinbase has NOT resumed trading for me.
"Bitcoin sales are temporary disabled" 
as of 10 seconds ago. 
I wanted to sell at 19k and then buy again when it stabilizes.
fuck this.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:48
Lol it's like a 5% drop that's not a dip in crypto. That's a blip!
It's gotta move at least 10% for me to even start paying attention.

dot com bubble was trillions of dollars and mainly just in the US. 
with inflation since then, plus the fact that btc's cap is only around 300 billion right now and it's entirely worldwide? the bubble has a LOOOOONG way to go before it pops.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:35:03
wait a few minutes, it's still dipping. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:45:17


wikileaks is anti-hillary because she fucking wants assange dead for exposing US govt lies. 
assange was only pro-trump by default of being anti-hillary, and that gives him the appearance of being russian employee if you want to see it, but he has no loyalty to russia. he's trying to find whatever angle he can to be free again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:26
I'm just going to quote your own words and call it a day.


@_date: 2017-12-13 15:22:01
yes, it is. billions of people still haven't heard of crypto. they are all potential investors which will continue to grow the bubble. it will burst when it reaches a saturation point. A major geopolitical event that shakes confidence in crypto could cause a bit of a burst, but if that happened now it would recover.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:56:51


this isn't quite accurate. I'm in research mode. I'm going to just hodl about half my assets but the other half I plan to do a bit of trading. 
Maybe I should be looking into more than one option, one for each purpose?

devil's advocate here - if there's enough money involved, you can bet your ass there are conspiracies. The more money involved, the bigger the conspiracy. Although just about anyone who thinks they actually know what the conspiracy is, is probably ridiculous.

Much simpler than that: 
a phone number that only accepts calls from pre-authorized phone numbers, but has a built in "reverse collect call" service where someone can pay you a fee to call you if they aren't on your list. If they can't convince you to authorize future calls, then they would have to keep paying to keep calling you. 
The technology only works, though, if its done at the carrier level and literally does not pass the call through, unlike "blocking" a number which only changes what you visually see on your end.
