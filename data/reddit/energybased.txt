Google (like any company) will one day pay dividends (even if they say it won't) or else it really is worthless.  They can even be sued by their investors if they refuse to return capital.

If you won't sell, you have no effect on the price.  The ask price is the smallest amount of money that any bitcoin owner would sell a bitcoin at.  The bid price is the largest amount of money that any buyer would buy a bitcoin at.
Since you're worried about bitcoin "going to zero", you're worried about the bid price going to zero.  You are counting on other people wanting bitcoins.

The government should absolutely not be involved in money creation.  Every modern democracy separates their central bank from their elected government to protect the value of their currency.  If an election has effects on monetary policy, then an election puts everyone's investment in that currency into question.  Most participants in an economy want currency stability and the central bank promises that.
