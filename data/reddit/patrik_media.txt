you dont know the reason but at least you know if youre shadowbanned or if your posts are actually visible
@_date: 2019-07-07 12:30:50
You said you can't see shadowbans, while in fact you can do that.
@_date: 2019-07-07 12:50:15
Doesn't change the point. Why you say you can't see a shadowban?
@_date: 2019-07-07 11:35:58
use a second account to check if your posts/comments are visible. whats so hard about that
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:00:11
Did you create it?

Imagine the heat coming out from all of these ASICs combined. Summer all year long!

You must be fun at parties.

I doubt thats just a font but rather custom made, after all its just 3 rings where one of them has a short line sticking out...

Just use a thing called brain and you're good.

Rok you rock!

The 28% is refering to WooCommerce (launched in 2011), the popular Wordpress plugin. It seems like via that shop the seller now can easily implement and accept crypto payments. This is great.

No they stated very clearly that coins don't get listed for a certain amount of money, unlike some other exchanges do.
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:44:34
Deposits and withdrawal fees for crypto were always 0 on Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-08-20 14:28:42
Yeah def check the box to enable adblocker in icognito mode.
@_date: 2018-08-30 17:12:36


I believe it when I actually see real evidence, the crypto world is full of bs and I wouldn't doubt some people/teams make stuff up just to get more attention.
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:06:47
Show me real evidence and I believe you.
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:44:07
Beautiful piece of art indeed!
@_date: 2018-08-20 13:49:19
What's wrong with Chrome and macOS?
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:45:15
I wouldn't say so considering 30% of websites run on Wordpress CMS and afaik WooCommerce is the most popular shop-plugin there. Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:43:32
Thats fine for a single transaction, but for online stores you need to have some sort of automated system. The majority won't code a new one when there are already options out there. I'd compare it to someone building his own CMS for a website vs simply using WordPress. As long as they don't take fees for receiving BTC, I'd be okay with that.
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:31:48
45 to be exact.
@_date: 2019-11-10 12:16:52
does he have acess tho? was there every any outgoing transaction?
@_date: 2019-11-23 16:18:02
i literally just spilled my coffe after reading your comment, goddammit lol
@_date: 2018-10-07 08:38:09
That name is hilarious! Nice reference.
@_date: 2019-11-27 07:51:45
What's the point in hodling forever? At one point you can and actually should enjoy your earnings, nothing wrong about that. I don't refer to buying a fancy car, just in general.
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:45:18
i think thats a great and unique gift, i hope your friend appreciates it!
@_date: 2019-08-22 18:56:25
yes, yes it does ��
@_date: 2019-10-04 10:36:32
OP actually invested in BCoin, not Bitcoin. ^/s
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:37:46
yep, its a pain in the ass if one would have to pay double the price for the same product just shortly after. i'm glad i grabbed mine on black friday.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:23:29
Joke aside, they actually did highly increase the price for a period of time when demand was high. I remember paying half the price when I got mine in fall 2017 vs. the price it was 3 months later. Now it's way back down again like it used to.
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:16:13
71 open tabs, jeez.
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:21:31
Oh wow, and I get nervous when I see like 5 open tabs on my browser, closing them instantly for actual no particular reason other than thinking they might draw unnecessary power or so^^
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:17:30
haha :D
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:43:39
let me guess, its not efficient at either task. just a crippled product trying to do both.
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:04:45
its just an other platform tho
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:08:25
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:24:10
About 1$ each is what you can buy them for on eBay.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:24:13
fomo at its best
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:25:00
i can recommend bitstamp if you live in europe
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:40:40
Love it
