Most people would call this a loan. Which in turn you would pay more then what you got. Plus fees for telling you how to do just about everything. It would probably be easier just to give ourselves another set up and profit??? But hey if there are rich guys out there just throwing money around. Hook me up too! I'll double what this guy pays you back.

How much do you make. Or your business rather. Just curious. I plan on opening a dispensary if my state will ever man up.
