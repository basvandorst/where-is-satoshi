1 Question:  How hot is it in that room?

WSJ has been headed downhill ever since Rupert Murdoch's bunch bought them. Now they strive for sensationalist hype instead of facts.

"Too big to fail" is a measure of political clout, not economic impact.

No, people were required to pay taxes on Bitcoin exactly the same way before the IRS ruling. 4/15 won't cause a dip in the Bitcoin market any more that it does in stocks, bonds, or gold.

They had to pay quarterly taxes in January, and will again in June, just like most profitable businesses. It's a nonevent.

I understand why you should not use the transaction ID for confirmation. How can you confirm a transaction without using the ID? There could be many transactions going to the destination address for the same amount, from various sources -- how do you know which, if any, is the one you sent? Is the source address transmitted with the transaction info?

It's taxed exactly the same way it was. If you buy *anything* and sell or trade it for a profit, you owe taxes on it. There are different rules for currency, and the IRS just said Bitcoin does not fit into that category.

Because you're only looking back a few weeks. Compare the price to a year ago.

By default, bitcoin was an asset instead of a currency. The tax ruling confirmed that. So there is no change.

Plan on failures. Exchanges are unregulated and uninsured. Use your own wallet or USD in an FDIC insured bank if you want security.

It's no different than if you bought Gold, Hungarian Forints, or Wheat.

...and purchases of $30,000 per day. It takes two to trade.

Good question. There are a lot of similarities between gold and bitcoins. Gold as a fundamental, non-monetary value of about 1/6 its price. Bitcoin has zero. The advantage of bitcoin is that it's like electronic cash, without going through a bank or credit card company. Its value is volatile because it is relatively new and it's unregulated. As an investment, Bitcoin is highly speculative. As a barter / payment tool, it's very convenient in many cases. For example, paying a company overseas for goods or services, or in a country whose currency is hyperinflationary.
