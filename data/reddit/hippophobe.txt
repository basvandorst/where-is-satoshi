If your plan was just to buy some BTC and just let it sit there then no you didn't fuck up. You still have the same amount of BTC. It's just certain people in this world who are artificially lowering the value as it relates to dollars. Just hang onto it and you'll be glad you did.

Exactly. It makes me think of when you're driving on the highway, and you can perceive that the car distantly in front of you is moving ever so slightly slower than you are. You can't really measure or prove they are going slower yet, but you can just feel it. This is how people subconsciously spend their money when there is even the smallest whiff of inflation. People feel like they can't spend their money fast enough and will happily open store credit cards even with the interest rates because of the, again subconscious, feeling that it will be cheaper to pay back later.
But yet when there is even the smallest amount of deflation, every purchase is suddenly subject to a high level of scrutiny. And this is where Keynesian economists freak out and cry because the economy (as we know it today) will crash if people put a second or third thought into their endless consumption habits.
This is the part I love about the whole deflation is bad argument. The reality is if people are in desperate need of food, water or shelter then they will acquire their basic needs with whatever means they currently have even if that means a larger sacrifice in the future. The only time the scrutiny of a purchase comes into play is when it's something we don't really need. And that's when you realize our entire economic system is revolving around people's constant purchasing of things they don't need.

Yes so that means you need to trade quickly to preserve the initial dollar amount. But really there are so many variables that go into a trade and generally if Bitcoin has decreased in value then so has the altcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:41:14
My understanding is yes that's correct because BTC isn't really money it's a product you are selling. Still a business but not a money transmitter. Now if you also offer the opportunity to sell BTC for USD then you would probably have to apply for a money transmitter license for EACH STATE where you would like to do business. Because at that point you are taking somebody's fiat money who bought BTC and reissuing it to somebody else who sold BTC.

He is correct, the problem with inflation and consumerism is trifold. The underlying assumption is that everything you are buying will only get more expensive later as your money decreases in value. This also encourages people to take on debt because it makes it seem like you are freezing the price of something in time, where it will be easier to pay back later once you get that raise. Third it puts pressure on people to spend all their money as fast as possible as if it will be worthless tomorrow.

Because volume has picked up and there is now a demand for any particular individual to have his transaction get confirmed ASAP so therefore a higher fee would allow him to skip to the front of the line. Blockchain transactions are not first in first out unless everybody is paying the same fee. On smaller coins everybody pretty much does pay the same fee but that's what BCH gets for wanting to debut as a top 5 coin instead of starting from the bottom like everyone else.

A money transmitter strictly refers to somebody accepting USD or another fiat currency and then reissuing it to another party, usually electronically.

Copay *should* be safe because you can see your own private key or seed phrase for the wallet that is only supposed to be stored on your device. But Bitpay has also appeared to have sided with BCC so you should still use caution. It might be better to move your coin to a paper wallet and then sweep it with Copay after the dust settles and see if they've made any changes to be incompatible with BTC. It's possible (but improbable) they could update the app to be BCC-only and then you might not have access to your original wallet anymore.

If it's in a paper wallet then just leave it alone until at least the end of August but could be towards the end of the year (depending on what happens) before you can withdrawal. In the case of a chain split make sure whatever wallet software you are using to sweep the paper wallet has replay protection in place so you can get both types of coin. If you intend to leave it in the paper wallet then you will absolutely be fine just leaving it alone.

@_date: 2017-07-16 00:30:59
That is correct the only time software is required is transferring it to and from the paper wallet. As long as the coin is residing inside the address printed on the wallet then no software can do anything to it without the private key. 
If you go on a popular hosted wallet like Coinbase you will find that they don't actually support importing directly from the private key. So you need an intermediary which does support this, two I have used are blockchain.info and Copay by Bitpay. Both of these wallet providers have been very wishy-washy about their plans after August 1 so that's why I hesitate to recommend any specific one because maybe their support and security will be lacking after things change here in the next few weeks. Which is why it's best to just wait and see who still supports bitcoin after we know what the final outcome is.

Only if the economy is based on endless consumption, ie always spending money on things you don't need. Giving an incentive for people to save money (because a product will be cheaper in the future) and not take on debt (because it will be more expensive to pay back in the future) is a good thing for a lot of people but it also hurts the corporations who depend on endless production and the people who depend on those corporations for employment.

Maybe so but in reality you only paid $2.21 for it. The opportunity cost would have been the same if you had chosen to pay dollars for the burger instead of buying more bitcoin. Hopefully though, the value of the bitcoins you used to purchase the burger had already grown beyond your initial investment. As hard as it may be to believe, you are actually coming out ahead here.
In a world of over consumption and so many choices of not just products but also how to pay, it's easy to forget that if we don't eat we will die. So you have to assume that paying for the burger was an absolute necessity. For every fiat dollar you spend on food that you also could have purchased with bitcoin, you are missing out on the opportunity to buy BTC and let it increase in value. If you spend BTC that you purchased a month ago it will have increased in value (because why would you spend it otherwise?) and you are actually getting more dollar value worth.
People always want to apply Gresham's law to bitcoin because of our tendency to hoard money we perceive as good. But really, this is the opposite, Thiers' law, because it makes more sense to spend the good money than hoard it with the provisions that it is relatively easy to acquire new replacement bitcoin and it continues to steadily, rapidly increase in value compared to the dollar.

Lol right the name reminds me of some nerdy kid. Segwit  (segregated witness) is a restructuring of bitcoin transactions by a method known at UASF (user activated soft fork) where the Bitcoin Core program for Windows/Mac/Linux actually changes what defines a valid bitcoin transaction. The way miners process transactions today won't work anymore if the UASF actually goes into effect and people install it. Some of them have patents on how they currently mine and also make boatloads from the ever increasing transaction fees, so naturally they are throwing a fit that the open standard is being modified not in their favor. So they say "well if you're going to do that, then we'll just start our own coin and mine that instead. It won't be the old bitcoin because we don't like that either, but a brand new bitcoin that only miners know how it works." 
The miners also give reason to their claims because they are tired of being the slave in the system and are mad that companies like Blockstream are going to twist their arm into doing all the computational work while they make all the money from making bitcoin the overdue replacement for ACH. The truth is big banks want an open replacement for the ACH and people accuse the core developers of having gone rotten because they are all now employed by Blockstream and under the influence of big banks. 
The worst part of this is that both sides are true. Bitcoin as an underground anonymous payment network is quickly changing, which at the same time is the BEST part. Either way best thing is to keep your savings coins in a hardware or paper wallet until all this blows over.

Because it's not proportional to the amount your spending nor is it proportional to the dollar cost of bitcoin. The mining fee has very little to do with how much you are spending but everything to do with the inputs/outputs needed to make the transaction possible. A $13 fee on a $10 transaction makes no sense and in fact if you only have a wallet with $10 worth of BTC you would have no way to extract that value.

Because regardless of what the US government thinks, people use bitcoin around the world and it will continue to rise in value despite today's events. If they say they think cryptocurrencies are bad, the demand will go up because most people already have the impression that the government thinks cryptocurrencies are bad and that's why the value is what it is. On the other hand, if they say it's good then the value will rise even moreso.

Certainly! Here is an *example* of the sheet setup I have. 
The first column is stats and BTC bought, second column is BTC expenses and third column is a separate savings wallet. 
The bought column USD represents the actual dollars taken out of my bank account and the BTC represents the actual bitcoin deposited into my Coinbase wallet. The real $/BTC is then autocalculated by diving the two.
The spent column column USD represents the USD purchase price I would have spent and the BTC represents the actual bitcoin spent.
The savings column BTC represents the actual BTC that was deposited into the wallet and the mining fee is the difference between what was sent to the wallet from Coinbase. I have considered the savings deposits to be BTC spent because I am not allowing myself to withdraw those funds.
Starting at the top left:
**B3** Current $/BTC is loaded with
     =GOOGLEFINANCE("currency:btcusd")
**B4** Avg $/BTC is calculated by
    =(USD spent on BTC + USD equiv of BTC Spent) / (BTC Bought + BTC Spent)
**B5** $ Cost/Payoff This is my cost or reward for doing business in bitcoin. Negative number means you've spent money, postive means you've earned money.
    =(Coinbase &amp; Savings Balance USD equiv) - (USD spent on BTC) 
**B6** $ Avg CP/Day This is my average daily cost payoff calculated by dividing the cost/payoff by the number of days since my first BTC buy.
    =B5 / (TODAY()-A12+1)
**B7** $ Total Saved sounds a bit misleading, but what it really means is "Total USD I didn't spend because I used BTC instead."
    =B5 + (USD equiv of BTC Spent)
**B8** $ Saved/Mo is the average USD I haven't spent per month because I used bitcoin instead. The actual figure of this is currently unrealistic because I don't have enough history yet.
    =(B7 / (TODAY()-A12+1)) * 30.44
**D5** Coinbase balance is simply
    =Total BTC Bought - Total BTC Spent
**D8** Coinbase + Savings balance just adds the savings wallet to that figure.
    =D5 + Total BTC Saved
**C5/C8** USD balances reflect the current BTC balance multiplied by the current exchange rate *and the fee required to cash out.* Also note that the total savings balance is subtracted by the average mining fee.
    =D5 * B3 * (1-.0149)

So you can either choose to spend your dollars and get about ~100% of your money's worth, or convert some of those dollars into bitcoin and then subsequently get ~110% of your money's worth. It's basically like saying "if only I had waited two years to buy that pizza, I could have bought 100 pizzas!" but in the real world you can't do that. It's much more realistic to say "if I want to buy 20 pizzas in two weeks, I should set the money aside now so that I can get one free pizza."

As somebody who sees the functional value in ETH for cloud computing and smart contracts, my hope would be that the hype now simply helps build the ecosystem and then a year or two from now the price levels off to slow, healthy growth. People who want to use ETH for actual purposes other than day trading don't want to have such a high degree of uncertainty. 
Imagine if Amazon AWS said one month their services cost $100 then the next month $300. That's not really beneficial for startups or really any business to be able to reliably use the technology for what it's meant. I wish people would just stop seeing it as the next crypto CURRENCY. It's not really meant to be a worldwide currency just a token for using the resources provided by the ecosystem.

My understanding is that the primary economic factor driving the creation of bitcoin was the huge amount of unpayable debt that caused the financial collapse of 2008. The whole point was to prevent people from spending money they didn't have. You either have the private keys  to the bitcoin or you don't, you either transferred bitcoin to the payee's wallet or you didn't. 
It really does't make any sense that our whole global society and economy is based on the notion that you consider my promise to pay as an asset. If I don't have the money to pay you for something then you darn sure don't have the money either. 
Isn't that why all the banks are getting burned on these subprime loans and trying to cover it up by paying off the debt with other people's money through derivative investment schemes? How is a rotting half built suburb from 2008 going to fulfill that IOU when there is no chance of ROI at this point and virtually any form of action or inaction on the real estate will only result in more spending? 
If you were a bank and already lent out your accounts receivables based on an empty promise you couldn't just say "oh jk I guess we don't have that money after all" because somebody else already spent it and probably didn't pay it back either. Do you see how this just creates a long chain of money that never even existed?

I would expect some retail banks to survive long term but seriously can we please stop supporting all of these fly by night banks that seem to be constantly popping up on every corner? Every time there's something new being built there's that "what is it?" excitement only to be disappointed to find out it's just another bank. They literally offer no value to the retail landscape. They should at least be required to sell piggy banks or something.

It's deflationary because it's value increases over time instead of decreasing which would be inflation, like most currencies. You will read everywhere that deflation is bad for the economy because people refuse to buy goods on the premise that it will be cheaper next month. And that's supposed to be bad because when people don't buy goods then the manufacturing workers don't have any work.
But when you look at the opposite scenario, under inflation people can't spend their money fast enough. Even though inflation in the US isn't nearly as bad as countries like Zimbabwe, think about how many people you know who spend money impulsively immediately upon receiving it. There is absolutely no incentive to wait because it will only cost more later. However it does give people an incentive to go into debt because in theory it will be easier to pay back in the future.
If you read closely about the Great Depression you will find that deflation is often blamed as a primary cause of unemployment. However what is often overlooked is that more millionaires were created during the Depression than any other time in US history. So you have to ask, who is deflation really negatively affecting—the people or the corporations/government?

I'm kind of glad it's cooling off for a bit and as of right now it's actually under 2700.

The great thing about Bitcoin being in the present situation that it's in is that you really have to think about what you want to spend it on before you spend it. It's honestly dumb to convert it back to fiat. Just buy a gift card from a variety of online stores that accept BTC for the gift cards and use it for grocery shopping or some other everyday expense.

Because the BTC sub is for all the pro-BU advocates to make it seem like Segwit is evil. It's basically a miner circle jerk and half of the posts are written with poor English which makes it seem like they are just posting nonsense because somebody told them to and not really interested in having real discussions. They seem just as vocal about their views as we are but in reality it's all manufactured by such a small minority.

In the US if you spend over $600 at any given retailer during a tax year then you are supposed to report it on your taxes and the IRS gets to decide if its a nominal or capital gain. And over the course of a year it's certainly not hard to do at a place like Walmart...or preschool. There's a reason why gift cards are put into the same category as cryptocurrencies in the latest bill proposal every one is talking about.

Luckily the wise among us know that three times identifies a pattern and at some point you have to say it's more than speculation and time to get serious about buying in. People in general seem to be more concerned with how much they might lose in the short term, as this article accurately portrays, rather than focusing on the obvious long term gains. Because most people are generally pansies and want somebody else with supposedly more experience to make their financial decisions for them, they can't justify doing something unconventional on their own.
Really looking at my pattern of losses over the past 7 years is what convinced me I was right all along. I lost millions in 2010 because the new Bitcoin Core program I installed was just too difficult to understand and was probably a waste of time to figure out. In 2014 I lost tens of thousands by telling myself how dumb I was to buy when the price was steadily going down, down, down and sold everything. In 2016 I lost tens of thousands again because I said I've seen it get to $1000 before just to decline into years of dark ages. Well then that didn't happen but instead it increased to $1990 and I realized I better get serious about this.
Sometimes it's necessary to let go of your ego, insecurities and emotions regarding what you really don't know about money, investments and economics which are all likely based on things other people have told you who really don't know anything either. Everybody in here is likely highly educated and have encountered many naysayers who just want (for some reason) society to stay in the same oppressive state that it's been since the 1970s. At some point you just have to say enough is enough and actually put your money where your values are.

Is it correct that most likely the version of the blockchain that is considered vanilla bitcoin (what a term to start using) will be whatever 51% or more of the everyday users, or nodes, consider to be the longest valid chain based on the rules in their software? 
So does that mean separate PC/Mac/Linux node software must be installed in addition to (or in replacement of more likely) any existing bitcoin software by actual users in order to recognize and distribute the new longest chain based on some other rules?
So what if a group says "We are going to launch an altcoin based on the existing Bitcoin Source code and call it WhateverCoin." Does that mean there has to be something fundamentally different about what defines this new coin in order for the software to even recognize the coin? If someone recompiled the existing bitcoin source would it function just like the existing bitcoin core software or is there some genesis key that only the core developers know in order to make it work with the real bitcoin?

Then at least buy a bunch of gift cards from cardcash with the bitcoins so the money stays in the economy, don't just convert back to dollars. At least that way if you've had a loss you can attempt to still break even or come out a little bit ahead. Either way everyone would be better off if the non hodlers spent their coins instead of just converting back to dollars.

Bitcoin Unlimited has their PR team downplaying their efforts to make it seem like they are only making a simple change to the core code to increase the block size like has been discussed on bitcointalk since 2010. But the truth is they already made the hard fork two years ago and the codebase is now so different that it can only be considered bitcoin in terms of ideology. For miners to start running this code on the bitcoin network is akin to MSN messenger attempting to integrate AIM support. They say their goal is to support the legacy blockchain but really it is secondary to building a new blockchain on top of the old which can only be interpreted by BU's proprietary code. 
Segwit on the other hand maintains bitcoin's open source nature  but in many ways it's just as much of a poison pill as BU. While the codebase is mostly the same and the changes are exactly known, the concern is that the wrong interests have become the stewards of the mainline code. It doesn't actually increase the block size limit but it essentially gzips the transactions to reduce their size. This is like widening the highway from 4 to 6 lanes. It relieves congestion for a while but invites more growth and before you know it the traffic is even worse than it was before. A year from now we'll have many times more people complaining about the same issues we have today and way more money will be at stake to be lost if something major isn't done.
Personally I think the biggest issue is the inevitable fact that banks and big business now have a vested interest in bitcoin and that is a primary reason for the network congestion in the first place. What's basically happening is that the community as a whole is saying the corporations have broken bitcoin and now it's their responsibility to fix it. If that weren't true then you would have way more viable alternatives at this point than BU vs. Segwit. This is where the Segwit camp's lightning network implementation attempts to address that. As far as I know, nobody is expecting regular bitcoin users to transact off the blockchain. This is for large financial institutions whose member accounts transmit large volumes of transactions per day. The thinking is, why does it really matter what the details are of the individual accounts? All that really needs to be on the blockchain is the transfer from bank A to bank B.

As with any increasingly valuable and scarce commodity, you will usually be buying at or near peak highs. Only buy what you can afford to pretend you've lost. Of course nobody can promise any outcome, but the value will likely increase soon to where you are making money. Just start a spreadsheet with all of your buys and keep track of the purchase fees so you know how much you actually spent and how much BTC needs to be before you actually make money. Google sheets is great for this because it can auto update the BTC price.
BIP 148 is an improvement proposal which changes bitcoin's disposition from a true currency to a settlement network akin to ACH. Right now it's like the Y2K everybody fears but at the same time continuing business as usual. Again nobody can promise, but business as usual after August 1 (the BIP148 activation date) will likely be the case.
If you plan to use bitcoin as a savings account then all of your savings that you don't intend to touch should be stored on either a hardware wallet, a paper wallet or even something like a software wallet on a virtual machine. Basically you should make every step necessary to limit others access to the private key of your savings wallet. If you use a hosted wallet like Coinbase then they keep your private key and if you just keep it on your regular computer inside the bitcoin core program then anybody else who uses your computer could access your private key.
