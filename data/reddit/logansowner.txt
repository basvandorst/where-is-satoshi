I'm a little frustrated with people comparing it to tulips. Those people don't seem to understand that there is a limited supply, and a limited amount available to buy at any time. There will only be 21 million of them, plus most likely several million have already been forever lost by early fractional owners/investors who forgot about it. A limited supply already makes the tulip comparison silly.
I won't pretend to guess on a eventual settling point, but the idea of it going to next to nothing again is in my mind very unlikely, it has too many potential future uses.
I bought in at $2200 and I'm happy regardless as I don't see it going that low. I'll probably cash out it it drops to 9 or hits 17 again, whichever comes first.

I'm not the only one to remember Lycos! Back in the day it was my favourite search engine.
Edit: Holy crap, it's still a thing! Not that I'd use it, but it's a thing still.

In Canada at least it is unfortunately actually true now.

All I know is I made 400 bucks while I slept last night... But I'm fully aware that it could all go away. On a positive note for miners, it means less because we didn't have to tie up cash like buyers did. If I lose it all, I still have my graphics cards, so it's not like I lost out even then.

I believe in it too, but why does anyone care what a founder of Yahoo of all things thinks?

I'm all for business deciding who they serve. I think my concern here is that it seems that this particular nut job has been chosen to be shut down by so many companies all at roughly the same time but for no particular action. Alex is guilty for sure if hate speech, but he's fine it forever, what happened the last few weeks that suddenly now, all at one time every large company he uses is shutting him down? There is something we're all missing here, someone with big power made this happen, it wasn't organic, if you know what I mean. Even CNN was actively contacting Twitter pointing out things he should be blocked for... That's just strange to me.
