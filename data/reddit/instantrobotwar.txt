Oh god, seriously? I need to verify my account to get my bitcoins out, and I submitted all my info a few days ago... now they're saying gox is going under, what will happen to my coins?!

I can access the site, I have never had trouble. 100% of my claim was 'accepted by the bankruptcy trustee', but who knows if that means I'll get anything back.

Correct. A lot of places won't let you use a credit/debit card for small purchases (ones under $5 or 10), and my local starbucks has a $0.10 cent discount incentive for using cash over debit/credit. It costs business owners a small amount of money every time someone uses debit/credit, so they always prefer cash.

I mean, we've been waiting for years and years. They keep meeting, getting nothing done, and then agreeing to meet again in 6 months, where again they do nothing and agree to meeting again in 6 months. This has been going on for YEARS. I have lost all hope in getting ANY of my thousands of dollars back.

Just curious, but isn't that entrapment?

A btc faucet gives out a very small amount of bitcoin (around .0000x) to anyone who requests it. It's free money (though in very small amounts), to get people interested in bitcoin.
