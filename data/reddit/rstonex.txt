I'll play.
1. It doesn't actually solve any problems not already solved by credit cards for local or internet transactions in the US.  Any fees that show up in credit card processing are either already in bitcoin or will soon be there, and will likely exceed those of credit cards, especially when processors get out of the startup phase and start focusing on revenue.
2. Risk of loss.  Unlike credit card or bank deposit funds, if your bitcoin is stolen, there is no recourse.  Having access to a bitcoin wallet is like having as much cash as someone chooses to carry with them or store somewhere.
3. Despite being marketed as decentralized, it's only as decentralized as miners choose it to be.  If mining pools choose to raise the fee required for a block to be processed, they could.  As long as pools are a thing, they will have an undue amount of influence on block priority.  
4. The politics of bitcoin users are crazy.  It's people who think the dollar is teetering on failure, and that banks and the government are out to get you, and this is the only way out.  Stop trying to sell bitcoin on this premise, it's ludicrous.
5. Too many people are viewing it as an investment for anyone else to consider it a currency.  Those who say that they're holding the bitcoin with an expectation to get rich, while trying to convince others to accept and spend it are the worst.
6. Regardless of advances made in other crypotcurrencies or applications of the technology, the bitcoin community insists on using a system is a dinosaur in terms of advancements, simply because they want their holdings to become more valuable, and ignoring any altcoins which may solve bitcoin's issues.
7. Lies are used to promote the currency.  Safe, secure, easy to use, no fees are all misnomers.  When a theft occurs, people will blame the victim for not going through a system of complex steps to secure their bitcoin that no common person would consider doing.
8. Transactions are not instant.  A merchant must take a risk or wait for confirmations for any in-person purchase.

Who would you blame if you accidentally sent cc payment to the wrong vendor and never received your merchandise?
@_date: 2014-10-17 03:30:04
Which points are no longer true?  I'm genuinely curious.
@_date: 2014-05-09 03:58:06
Don't you incur more fees by having people taking a conversion hit when buying bitcoins, then another fee when  you have to cash them out to pay for utilities, food, supplies, etc?
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:51:38
Why is it foolish?  By the discussion here, it looks like offering discounts for bitcoin is a waste of time.

Bitcoin interest is at 20% of what is was in December 2013.
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:52:50
It's not a good investment.  Those times have sailed.  Buy it if you need bitcoin to spend (drugs, ransomware), not as an investment.
Even the best news for bitcoin (company x accepting it, latest and greatest exchange) hasn't resulted in the value rising.
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:56:23
By that logic, next month would be an even better time to invest.  Or 6 months from now.
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:48:52
If a cryptocurrency does take hold, it will probably not be bitcoin.  As the OP lined out, it has too many inherent technical issues (aside from the social ones) that will limit its adoption.  As much as people here hate to admit it, it would be far easier to bring up another coin that solves the majority of bitcoin's problems, rather than try to graft layers of solutions on top of bitcoin.  The "fundamentals" are actually a liability, rather than a solution.

That's what was said the entirety of 2014.  And at the $300 bearwhale limit that wouldn't be breached.  And at $250.
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:08:50
Yeah, but now there is infrastructure, and big VC money, and media exposure, and large companies accepting bitcoin and the price keeps falling.  I think it's a bad investment, and everyone currently holding is regretting it.  Bitcoin in 2011 isn't a good comparison to bitcoin in 2015, 2014 is more relevant.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:46:33
Reality seems to refute your claim.

I'm sure there's an ebb and flow as suppliers and buyers move money in and out, depending on dark market activity.  What is it that you're trying to say?  Are you blaming bitcoin's 14 month fall on these auctions?
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:16:17
None of the auctions had a much of an effect on the price, since they were conducted outside of the exchanges from where prices are determined.  And none of the auctions themselves moved the price at all one way or another.
As for the darkmarkets, they've got the attention of the feds.  SR2 was infiltrated almost instantly, and they're probably watching the subreddit.  If you didn't know, reddit is served with plenty of subpoenas and warrants.  Posting about illegal activities you participate in online is pretty much always a bad idea.
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:20:51
Dark pools are notable for their lack of impact on markets.  How does this back up your claim that the auctions depressed the price?
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:28:13
If the competitors are free, it's because they're in startup phase, burning VC money, and operating at a loss, in an attempt to grab market share.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:22:13
The auctions were conducted off the exchanges, as far as an effect on the price, it was the same as if you moved coins from one wallet to another.  Any time an amount of coins similar to those auctioned off are dropped on an exchange with an intent to sell, prices drop.  Since the Draper purchases were actually made for above market value, by your theory, it would have raised the price, and it didn't.  So please, educate me on how I'm wrong.

A crash where something drops 1% for 5 minutes then recovers isn't even remotely comparable to the volatility of bitcoin.
