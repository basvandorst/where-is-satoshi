Time to leave F2Pool I guess. So long and thanks for all the Discus Fish!

Hmm. Seems kinds of hypocritical coming from him. What do they say about glass houses?
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:41:16
Actually, I'm pretty sure that other core devs have previously denied that he is a core dev. I'm not sure where the title came from.

10 million BTC you say? Please point me to an address that has 10,000,000 BTC.
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:24:28
This kind of behavior from him goes back much further. I can recall several occasions where has openly advocated attacking the network to prove a point, most notable during the malleability issue when he offered to help people exploit the malleability problem to support some kind of personal agenda, I can't even recall what it was now. He also famously sold off half his coins during the GHash 51% debacle. Make no mistake that Peter Todd is a bitcoin bear, I don't even know if he holds any coin at this point.

If you really believe that Luke then I think it's time for you to step away.

Sure, but as I understand it even lightning isn't useful to me if the cost of a transaction is $50. If I set up payment channels, the settlement date better be years in the future and the total value of the encumbrance would have to be very high. I don't think that I want to have to commit thousands of dollars to a contract so that I can "enjoy" the benefits of bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:16:43
But the price is only that low because currently the real cost of running the network is subsidized by the block reward. The real cost of transactions even now is much, much higher, and as the coinbase reward diminishes that cost will either get picked up by the users, or the network security will severely decline. A future where there is a low block subsidy and the network is 500x larger will result in a fee much higher than $50, if we want the same level of security. Plus, Apple and Microsoft are just two companies, I am hopeful that our sights are set higher than the value of just two American companies.

Yeah, crazy right? I don't know who did the math on that valuation, but I sincerely hope that they are not still in the world making business decisions.
@_date: 2014-11-28 13:26:48
Read the white paper if you haven't already.
@_date: 2014-12-06 19:21:46
Sure, but it wouldn't take long for market mechanisms to drive the price up to where such an attack would start to become very, very costly. I'm sure miners would love it if someone decided to try this.

If you do some research into how Cuban made his fortune, you will be much less impressed with him.
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:51:56
Yes. I also heard from someone on the inside, very credible information, that the PBOC will start executing bitcoin users on the 21st. True story, sell while you can.
@_date: 2014-11-28 14:32:08
Yes I have.
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:33:17
I think this is more likely the result of the price decline and the marginal cost of production. A similar thing happened in 2011, and the hash rate and difficulty fell for a while.
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:00:36
I would suggest trying to spend it directly rather than 'cashing out'.

Sorry, I didn't think that I was going to have include a sarcastic eye-rolling smiley at the end of that post. I've pretty much had it with the China fear-mongering.

The terrorism and money laundering comment seems to be there to help separate himself from the controversy that many associate with bitcoin, as is the comment that you could build a different system based on the bitcoin technology. He will be able to maintain plausible deniability to disassociate himself with bitcoin if things turn sour, however he does also mention that the attribution layer could be built on top of bitcoin. All-in-all, I would say it's a pretty strong endorsement, even if it's a calculated one.
@_date: 2014-09-26 22:58:14
It's extremely impressive, and good for him for pulling it off, but the magnitude and timing of the exit was beyond lucky, he won the lottery. I've just never found him to be very impressive and don't regard his opinion very highly.
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:33:15
By media sparkle do they mean the multitudes of articles about how bitcoin is a scam that is only used by drug dealers and terrorists with no intrinsic value and destined to fail in a spectacular mess?
@_date: 2014-10-27 20:14:51
Hmm... which one? :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:39:07
Hmmm, if this is disappointing to you then you should probably look elsewhere for a new hobby, you're probably not going to be satisfied with what happens over the next few years.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:15:59
Since Bitcoin can no longer be easily dismissed, critics and skeptics are just extending their ignorance and playing the easy card. The "something better" will likely just be an iterated Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:02:08
You know, the same could be said of Peter Todd who has connections with a number of a bitcoin companies, as well as his role as Chief Scientist at Viacoin, a competing system. I would say that Peter has a much larger conflict of interest here and I personally question HIS motives. I also don't appreciate his or your own complete lack of tact in dealing with these complex and difficult issues and as such I think you have both undermined your credibility.
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:26:26
This is not true. All nodes, not just mining nodes validate transactions on the P2P network. Changes that produce invalid transactions are still rejected by the network.
@_date: 2014-04-15 18:17:07
I did not appreciate the amount of Ethereum advertising that was EVERYWHERE. There were a lot of free Ethereum branded shirts and buttons all over the conference and not a single take-away for anything bitcoin related. I felt constantly bombarded by Ethereum branding. To me, it would be like going to an OpenOffice conference and seeing Microsoft Word advertisements and swag everywhere you went. No matter how they try to market Ethereum, I think there is an inherent conflict here, especially given Anthony Di Iorio's involvement as both the director of the Bitcoin Alliance and his position as a founder of the Ethereum team. This conflict of interest makes me wary of their activities.
@_date: 2015-01-28 02:21:39
Holy shit, I MUST know. Going now to get 15000 BTC from cold storage to send immediately!
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:14:56
I guess my confusion is that the article suggests that there is a 'cascade' scenario like you describe in your first sentence, but when you 'borrow' coins to sell short, you are essentially buying them with a contractual obligation to repay the loaned amount. So you are still acquiring bitcoin, unless the shorts are naked but let's leave that topic aside. If enough wannabe traders want in on a potentially lucrative shorting opportunity, eventually the short margins will run dry. I just don't see how it isn't self correcting at some point and eventually the opportunity would not reverse itself.
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:14:59
Cool, please point me to the API where I can audit your company ledger to ensure honest and transparent operation. Oh and while you're at it, I would also appreciate if you would show me where on your company website I can access the service that allows me to send money anywhere in the world, instantaneously, and without providing you with any personal information. Thanks, you guys at Citi rock!
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:24:30
I was not necessarily referring to companies, but there are companies in the space who are providing provable audits through the blockchain, and we should be demanding that they all provide this basic service. This level of provable auditing is not truly possible outside of bitcoin (with its radically transparent blockchain), which is more the point.

This seems unlikely to happen, however, there is one thing that supports the possibility. The (now former) CEO of McDonalds, who just stepped down yesterday, is a good friend of Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, both of whom are known bitcoin investors and proponents. I was not aware of this connection until Marc Andreessen posted this to his Twitter yesterday:
"Respect to Don Thompson for tackling big challenges at McDonalds over last 3 years! Brilliant man &amp; close friend of  and me both."
Perhaps this was his last order of business before exiting the company. We'll see soon enough.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:04:52
It's not deterministic, however the Core software creates a keypool consisting of 100 addresses at creation. It then creates new keypools whenever the existing pool is exhausted. If you have used less than 100 addresses then your original backup will have everything. If you exhausted the pool and transferred coins to newly created addresses then those coins will be gone.
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:26:05
Interesting. Nice catch.
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:52:52
There is no conflict here at all. One could pick almost any address from the blockchain and neither you nor I would be able to determine who the owner is, yet the whole history of transactions is there for all to see and audit. Furthermore, I could send you bitcoin right now, without ever meeting you or even knowing who you are and no one could stop it from happening. These things were not possible before bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:57:05
If there is money to be made trading this market, would that not attract new savvy traders who first have to acquire bitcoin in order to play, thereby increasing the aggregate demand and thus the price? Furthermore, would this not also apply in the other direction? If the books are lopsided to the shorts, would there not be an even bigger opportunity in pushing the price higher? Maybe I have this all wrong and someone with more trading expertise can help me out.
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:28:47
Really. Really. Disappointing. I smell fear.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:04:38
Currently it is the only way that I can signal my desire for bigger blocks, so I really don't have any other option at the moment. I would like to see an alternative, perhaps a BIP100 implementation.
@_date: 2015-08-14 19:22:38
My recollection is that they briefly eclipsed 50% at which point everyone freaked out and adandoned them.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:54:06
That's funny because I was thinking that I might sell all my coins and join Litecoin if the blocksize increase does not happen. You do realize that Litecoin has 4x the effective transactional capacity that Bitcoin has right?
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:36:49
Not for now.
@_date: 2015-07-08 03:08:14
Peter Todd has been actively seeking payment to attack the network again and again for years now. I don't know why anyone in this community trusts him.
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:20:48
How DARE you come here and spout such logical arguments!
@_date: 2015-09-30 15:38:11
Unfortunately, his network analogy is backwards.
"Consider if early researchers of computer networking had similar tunnel vision about their nascent technology: 'Computers should only be networked for university and government research.'"
The blockchain "innovations" that financial firms are exploring are the ones that will limit access. Bitcoin IS the open standard, that's the point.
@_date: 2015-09-25 13:55:58
Some interesting points, however, the article is written as if this will be the first reward halving. Strangely, there is no mention of the previous bitcoin halving, but there is a mention of the recent Litecoin halving.
The predictions of what might happen also contradict what was actually observed during the last halving. Mining is LESS centralized now compared to before the previous bitcoin halving, so currently there is no reason to think that mining should centralize more. Also, price was not suppressed by miners selling more, quite the contrary in fact.
Although there is no reason to think that the results from the previous halving will be replicated in the next, it is strange to make contradictory conclusions against what has been observed in the past.
@_date: 2015-09-02 13:13:15
Agreed. It is amazing to me that with all the concern over "centralization" of mining, nodes and exchange services, there does not seem to be the same concern over the "centralization" of development that we are witnessing here. This place has become a dangerous monoculture in my opinion. The devs should only be concerned with building infrastructure, fixing bugs and patching security holes, but they should not be meddling with the economics of the system. That is not their place, nor are they qualified to do it. Similarly, this subreddit has become an echo-chamber of a single viewpoint, and effectively shunned valuable members of this community.
@_date: 2015-03-03 22:54:32
When people say that bitcoin cannot be separated from the blockchain they really mean that the token cannot be removed from the blockchain, be it bitcoin, litecoin or whatevercoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:31:43
She sure seems to write a lot about a dead-end technology that's supposedly going nowhere. Keep up the good work Isabella, 5 or 6 more articles like this and your readers will start to understand that bitcoin is here to stay.
