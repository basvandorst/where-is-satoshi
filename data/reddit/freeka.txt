Because like now value is pinned to USD, and how in the past value was pinned to gold, future crypto value will be pinned to BTC. True value will be measured in Bitcoin, and other currencies will determine their value based on how it can be traded for bitcoin. Transactional currency is an orthogonal problem to the problem of cryptographically storing value in a 0-trust network, the latter of which is solved by bitcoin. And it is not the only crypto that solves this, but is the first, and empirically what is being decided on by everyone to be the true store of value.

Bitcoin is a store of value. People are storing their value in the blockchain. Instead of fiat, instead of an investment portfolio, instead of gold. We are buying a thing of value because our value is encoded in the blockchain securely, and free from the random gamblings of the stock market, or of the stagnant centralization of the bank. There will be quick-spend and low-fee-spend crypto in the future. Bitcoin is not it. But as a store of value, it is damn good, and the more people who place their value on the blockchain, the stronger it gets.

Being used in transactions is important for daily exchange currency, a small value transaction exchange of value. Bitcoin is not that and the technical architecture wouldn't even support that use case (based on e.g. visa transaction rate)  - even with increased block size. We have to solve that problem secondarily. But more importantly, bitcoin represents a store of value - something that quick spend currency can be based on, but not in itself a quick spend currency which modern economies can be based on.
