Discussion is always the best, but the extreme point of view expressed in this post and especially your answer is not a good starting point. Relax and try to understand your partner in discussion so he will understand your points.
I'm in bitcoin since the early days when i paid cents for a bitcoin and i'm a daily reader here since many years. 
This wouldn't become so far and ugly if discussion would be allowed when the blocksize debate started 2 or almost 3 years ago ;(
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:31:08
This is not a 51% attack. Please stop spreading misinformation. There is no "single" miner that tries to kill bitcoin with a double spend attack. There is building consesus over the past month that bitcoin needs bigger blocks instead of an off chain solution.
I'm also totally shocked by the PoW change proposed by the core team. Its like a child that dont want to play by the rules and destroys all the toys. 
In my opinion a fork to get bigger blocks is done by actors that want to secure the network and there miner income.
A fork by developers to manifest there power is dangerous because unknown bad actors can jump in and use the uncertainty of a pow change to harm bitcoin and try a real 51% attack.
Please let us find a solution that keeps up the face of both side.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:38:16
Its the end of the divided community. Lets come together and make bitcoin great again.

@_date: 2017-10-11 18:26:09
This is a made up fantasy. You can't argue with an event that did not happen. UASF was the same attack on bitcoin that core labels the s2x upgrade.
I cant believe you are getting through with this made up story. In Germany we have a word for this, i dunno if exists in english. Its "Geschichtsverdreher". 
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:21:07
The EDA on bitcoin cash did not kicked in. It will maybe kick in after the next DA. Its only miners switching from sw1x to bitcoin cash right now. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:07:47
Why is nobody mentioning, that the bitcoin cash hashrate is a lot bigger then of the sw1x chain. Its 57:43% for bitcoin cash
The switch between bitcoin cash and sw1x is to fast. Sw1x is producing blocks at 20 minutes right now. Doubling the time till the next difficulty adjustment.  The next sw1x difficulty will be 30+ percent lower than now. That will cause 30+% faster blocktimes after the next DA. 
So the fast switching of the miners is causing a lot of oscillations and the upcoming 3rd possibility sw2x to switch from and to will make it only worse.
@_date: 2016-10-24 16:25:27
Ok thx for your detailed answer. 
But i read that the miners only get 2 transaction fees when opening and closing a channel. Why should they support this when they can have multiple fees using on chain scaling? 
And is it possible for me as simple user to use LN transactions like the actual bitcoin Transaktion to my simple friend or the guy st the cafe without waiting so long like thesedays?

It was a currency when it was useable some time ago. I remember the old times, when i used my android bitcoin client to send tips or pay the bets for playing table Soccer at the office.
We ordered pizza paying with bitcoin and in the evening i went to room77 drinking beer paying with bitcoin. 
Using bitcoin to exchange between people was creating such a nice social athmosphere. It was easy, fast and fun.
Now everyone is using bitcoin only for themself to hodl and storing wealth. Thats not as funny as it was back in the old days
@_date: 2016-10-24 04:57:41
Yeah but then its not bitcoin anymore. Why don't they fork and rename it bitcoin2.0 
As far as i understood miners will not support an off chain scaling that does not give them the fees that are generated by the increased traffic on the sidechains. 
Btw. what i really dont understand is, who will secure the sidechains by mining/proof of work? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:17:17
Wow thats a great comment

My Account is much older than yours, i'm a daily reader since 6years and was into bitcoin from almost the beginning, thats the reason why i support on chain scaling.

Its definetly not my opinion, but it is the most negative post about bitcoin in the last weeks. Don't be too negative about this post. Just read and relax. The question is legit

"Subpoena an Opportunity for Bitcoin Companies
However, the companies that have been served subpoenas are not feeling unsettled; rather, they are considering it is an opportunity to prove their points. Jaron Lukasiewicz, chief executive of Coinsetter, says that it is an opportunity for companies to open up a much needed dialogue with regulators and show them that they are working to legitimize Bitcoin.
Mr. Lukasiewicz also said that Bitcoin companies are looking for building bridges that help regulators understand and support these financial innovations. The Department of Financial Services (DFS), headed by Benjamin Lawsky also plans to issue a memo expressing concern that Bitcoin companies are not complying with the state’s money transmission laws."

Why do you want the big solution at once? Just start with funding flattr account with bitcoin. That could easy be done with bitpay that send u euros. Do the withdraw stuff later or never. There arent so many withdrawer and i bet they would choose euro instead of bitcoin.

comment by Andreas • 5 hours ago −
The article contains some factual errors. First, the Bitcoin Foundation has not advised users, There was a security alert on bitcoin.org  for users to update their Android Wallet software and generate new keys. All Wallet software has been updated on the same day and the current versions are secure.
However, Google has not fixed the issue fully, and some more research and a global update of all Android software is neccessary to ensure secure communication and solid cryptography. In the meantime, every app developer should avoid using SecureRandom and read directly from /dev/urandom instead.
