Afaik, having your own electrumx server makes you a full owner of your bitcoin, and it gives you the possibility to work with a watch-only wallet (importing your masterPublicKey)
ElectrumxServer needs 40Gb at the moment

Iirc : many Chineses/Japaneses universities are working on it

Several comments on forums/sites from which i understood it was better to choose a random node, as to offer new routes, avoid centralization, as usual

I was told to randomly chose a node to create a channel , how do you find useful place to insert a channel ?

How high : 1000 000 satoshis / tx ? 
When block reward is less than 1BTC (2032), this could garantee miners to get 50 BTC just by collecting those fees, lets say a full block contains 5000 tx
