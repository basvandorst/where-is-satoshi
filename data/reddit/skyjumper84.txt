I have the address, but how do I know where it's going? Or went for that matter?

Thanks I have, heres the hackers address 
Ironically the reciept says it was completed by uphold, they locked my account but I got a screen shot of it first.

I definitely did but they seem like they are just shady saying things like we are looking into it we will let you know? To me when you are dealing with lots of money this not exactly acceptable. Uphold has no phone number yet they manage millions of dollars???

Yea I was actually doing that, in the process of transferring them to a nano s, I had to log in to get the address for the transfer to the cold wallet. I'm looking for real advice if i wanted to hear i told you so I'd go talk to my gf, thanks for your comment about nothing pertaining to being informative...

Sorry for such little detail,  my uphold account somehow was log into without my authorization, my BTC was sent to a random address? Just wondering if there is any hope because uphold's customer service is terrible thus far. No phone number, takes forever for them to write back and all they ever say is your account locked, we will let you know... I figure with only 100 to 120 employees how long could this take ?   
Additionally, I cant process my lifelock claim unless they give me a response? Mean while I just feel like uphold is giving me the run around?
