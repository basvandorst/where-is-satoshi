bears dont control the market, the term bears is given for those that speak negatively towards a subject.
The control of bitcoin is simple, its the 2-3% that control 98% of the coins, that term is called the whales.

It's also possible to decrease  but then you would get these patterns below
1. Increase of whale activity
2. Money coming out of exchanges
3. Hash rate dropping
We're not getting these signs but the opposite
This is mentioned in the medium article

Why does tax  only care when you make profit.  What about when you make losses.   
If there is a tax on earnings, shouldnt  there be a tax reimbursment for losses!!

paypal is used as a payment system to assist merchants and overseas payments, with high exchange fees.
bitcoin is used as an investment platform, for people to hodl and get rich
best chance is xrp but people need to stop buying it as an investment.

500 btc is very normal activity, I would be worried if you saw 500 btc \* 5 within the hour.
If you want to track the activity then go to [cryptoflow.vip]( that will show you how much whale activity is going on as the blockchain is public.
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:14:30
Its monday and Bitcoin has started to rise as I predicted.
Transactions still quite low.
More money coming in.
Expect 10k to 12k 
Not sure what will happen (before or after)
Bitcoin is definitely not crashing, too much vested interest at the moment, especially with libra.

guys and gals i just saw the biggest transactions yet.
Some serious crazy transactions happened in last two hours.Unconfirmed whether they are buys or sells, but I'm trying to work it out.
I don't know whats going to happen, but it might be a good idea to pull out.

Its not a good time to buy bitcoin right now, I don't have bitcoin so I don't have a vested interest.
Look at the money transactions from whales.
Then look at what just come out of bitmex exchange.
I would check the graphs and the exchanges before entering the ocean with sharks.

Its the hourly volume for the exchange for all cryptos added up together.
Whenever you see this, the price usually goes down.
Its an indicator.
If we look so far, price has already dropped.
maybe those that dold will come back in, but for now they haven't

I got my data from [cryptoflow.vip]( if you got a question just ask.

Yeah this not possible, i can come to 3 conclusions
1. the api getting this data, made an error getting this data
2. the exchange misreported this number.
3. a previous dev manually inserted thsi figure

This is inline, with the following inflow I'm currently seeing:
@_date: 2019-08-12 11:18:27
I don't see how this is possible because  each transactions is written to the blockchain(public database). Then a set of miners from different locations verify independently a sequence of the block. 
They are then publically displayed on this database.
Exchanges cannot just create a transaction out of thin air...
As it very easy for an exchange to be proven wrong and then that would be very catastrophic for the exchange.
@_date: 2019-08-18 10:19:54
You are correct
I will need to track why this happened

All blockchain transactions are added up together.
cryptoflow.vip/transaction gets all of the transactions and then the totals are added up.
So before bitcoin pumped, there was nearly 2billion in transactions coming and going to wallets recorded on the blockchain.
For usdt this event is unique and doesn't happen often.

It depends on the price you buy and sell. You need to be able to swim with the whales...   
If you want to play short time. 
If you want to hodl, there is no guarantee btc will go up.  
Its not based on a company growth, but what people are willing to pay for it.
I would agree with your parents.

I checked cryptoflow.vip and last Sunday did:

This bull analysis appears wrong.  
So far in days of monitoring BTC, you are down 6.5Billion dollars in USD.

Before bitcoin go up, it will need to rebound from the 6 billion dollars that is in arrears.

If i buy 1 Btc from an exchange, then the exchange needs to purchase that btc .  
Thats why you spend x money for (the exchanges price)
\--&gt; Then the exchange purchases that btc
Otherwise its a made up figure...  
And the exchange has just taken your money.

It was a hashrate of 86E last week.  
It increased to 90E , thats what is keeping the price stable at the moment.
The exchange volume show a recent surge of 2.5B inflow!  
But 500M for bitcoin only.
But neither btc or alts pumped.  
It doesn't seem to have much affect on price!

Not really, you would need a way to accept US Dollars, AUD, Euro, British pound,  etc, etc  
Then you would need a way to verify that they are not fake notes.  
You would also need a way to ensure, two or more notes are not inserted at once

It may have been missed by whale alert but [cryptoflow.vip]( picked this up from exchanges volume and it was more than 1Billion.
We are also getting whale alerts, but we will work on going direct from blockchain from now on...
@_date: 2019-09-13 00:02:08


Thanks for explaining that, I might have to read that again, to comprehend it!
Wow so the volume that could be verified then is :
4 - 5 When  a user deposits into an exchange (inflow). This incorporates being moved into a wallet, hence it will go through the blockchain
10-11 - When we get a sell, it will go through the blockchain.
So It seems the initial concept was correct, but was missing the understanding of the process. 
This means that it is possible for exchanges to provide inflow - buys coming in from blockchain
and outflow - whenever customers are selling, the transaction on the blockchain.
And I believe we are already getting Outflow - i.e Through Whale Alerts.
But how good would it be if we were able to get exchanges blockchain in/out 
Rather than current situation, which could be all made up with no substantial proof.
