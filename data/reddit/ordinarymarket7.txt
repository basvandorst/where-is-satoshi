Uhhh, of course it's worth $0. But who cares? Everyone just trades this for quick money!
@_date: 2018-05-31 23:19:03
this guy makes my skin crawl just listening to him. i'm doing the opposite of what he advises.
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:43:32
possibly, but you can't have a store of value that is simply a piece of code. there are now over 1,500 pieces of code out there all claiming to be do something, when in fact they do nothing. that's why this doesn't work. there is no barrier to entry. my grandma can write code and claim it is money!
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:38:37
bitcoin was started, in part, because of corrupt governments and their manipulations. this has to be one of the most hilarious statements by a government that i have ever heard. no, organized crime doesn't use bitcoin. haaaaaaaaa
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:46:23
i suggest you go back and read the white paper. the greed/corruption/manipulation by banks and the feds that caused the 2008 crash is why btc was born.
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:25:45
when they exist that could be interesting. however the discussion is on bitcoin which is basically air
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:14:12
i'm not in too deep nor am i uncomfortable with what's going on. just a bit frustrated by the price action. a few billionaires are controlling the price and that's ruining it for the rest of us. i don't think it is a bargain down here but might be a nice buy at the 6,800 support level.
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:53:42
bitcoin has become a fast trade for the rich. stating that it's otherwise is talking your book.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:57:02
Wait until $3000 range then pull da trigger on BTC. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 20:48:09
nice civilized comment. never recovered from 20k and not likely to ever see 10k again. back to your parents basement! that's an order!
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:28:56
it's beginning to look like the bull run is BULL!
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:57:15
no actually it's not!
@_date: 2018-05-16 16:15:09
yes, and each one of the fed presidents go on to wall street related careers when they leave. hmmmmm 
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:01:22
agree but where does the pain stop? so many head fakes towards 10k only to reverse. everyone i know is in this for a quick trade. final flush seems like it could take us below 5k. what say you?
@_date: 2018-05-13 02:45:43
So how do I put this....BTC is 100% manipulated by a small group of billionaires (some call them whales) and is accepted for payment almost nowhere. Exactly opposite of what was supposed to happen. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:50:24
possibly but this latest pullback from 9,350/9,400 is quite frustrating! never any rhyme or reason other than the whale pigs are toying with it to make $.
@_date: 2018-05-14 23:47:46
banks can close your account at any time and never need to explain their decision. PNC and the scumbags at T. Rowe Price did this to me and refused to tell me why.
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:57:44
apparently i have done a lot more research than you friend. i didn't say they were all claiming to be a store of value. i said they claim to do "something". no one is disputing the value of decentralization and its usefulness. however, cryptocurrencies are totally bogus.
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:33:25
of course, there are no rules for unregulated exchanges. just look at the amount of constant spoofing; that's what really pisses me off.
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:12:30
you really need to stop posting bro, your lack of understanding of basic economics is embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:06:50
yes, be careful what you wish for. my guess is they will short the hell out of bitcoin. george soros as well.
@_date: 2018-05-16 00:02:07
well thought out and well written. however, this guy has been dead wrong on btc. he said the low for the year was in when btc bounced off 9,250 and i believe that was in january. he has said this at least 2 more times and has obviously been way off. all he does is talk his book and come up with wildly irresponsible price forecasts. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:43:24
i can see augur benefitting but not bitcoin, ethereum, etc. as usual makes no sense but that's crypto!
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:09:05
Have you tried Coinbase, Poloniex, or Binance. I'm considering those. Kraken is a nightmare.
@_date: 2018-05-01 01:45:09
do you mean trying to explain a piece of code someone made up and people are paying $9,000 for it? me thinks magic internet money will go poof...
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:47:47
a small group of mostly Aholes owns the majority of BTC. the price goes where they say it goes. you can bet they collude together and are making money on the way up and the way down. sad, really, cause this was supposed to be the "peoples" money.
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:59:13
exactly right! a handful of people (i.e., whales) own most of the coins and completely control the price movement. they simply pump and dump all day long making unimaginable amounts of money. this is polar opposite to its original intent. very sad.
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:09:58
i'm pretty sure they're going short. people wrongly assume that when institutions enter that they're going long. look at the big dump from 15k to 6k after the futures markets went live. that tells you everything you need to know
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:05:12
because 99% of stocks represent physical assets, intellectual property, and/or cash flows and dividends. you are not really asking this question are you?
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:33:23
price movement and consensus were a coincidence. you could link btc price movement to almost anything because it is so volatile. the comments on reddit remind me of the internet bubble when people held on for dear life and kept asking when will it recover? my advice is to get the hell out of this garbage unless you afford to lose 100%. otherwise find something safer to do with your $.
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:11:45
huh? the price has indeed fallen from 9,900 down to 8,200, there's no need for "evidence." i then proceed to speculate as to why. my guess is bill gates or others like him are shorting btc. you need to re-read the original post. btw, "opinions" are not always backed up by facts, they can merely be "opinions."
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:55:42
if you read the press release, they only made $200,000 profit after paying the cost of acquiring those bitcoin. not so great!
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:33:30
remember what they did with mortgage securities. my guess is they are going to short the shit out of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:31:28
there are some obvious ones like the winklvoss twins but most are unknown.
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:38:50
it was 8,750 this morning!
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:18:18
sorry. facebook comes out with a crypto, or starbucks etc. and btc will plummet. no question about it.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:44:14
if you are conscious then you can figure out bitcoin is obviously worthless. but who really cares because its a trading vehicle. buy it when there's FUD and sell it when there's euphoria. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:07:48
bet on them shorting bitcoin big time.
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:58:57
the greedy whale pigs will turn around and short this just when you least expect it. really no different than manipulation by the fed.
@_date: 2018-05-17 20:51:20
i think that's kind of the point of an opinion board. every comment on here is a guess/forecast. if your parents aren't charging you rent you'll be ok for another few months. but then....?
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:36:29
if the price of btc affects your "family" you made a bad choice friend. try to get out for even, and then move on.
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:46:48
it would be much better to try and first run the current operations competently!
@_date: 2018-05-04 22:03:29
middlemen taking a fee and a small group of whales controlling the coins and becoming billionaires. yup, just what bitcoin was designed to do!
@_date: 2018-05-16 16:12:19
the handful of elites who own all the bitcoin say playin'
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:41:32
unfortunately, that's what i'm thinking. the last time that happened we crashed to 6,600. no interest in seeing that again!
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:56:51
nice job with the fake news asshole
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:43:17
agree. this actually raises more questions than it answers. they would have been better off doing nothing!
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:29:39
Looks like it will be challenging that $5,900 low pretty soon. Better buckle up!
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:54:55
this is the same guy whose hedge fund went belly-up. i think i'll take a hard pass on his advice.
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:51:18
yes, he's a major pumper. put him on mute
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:42:23
the previous auditor left with no reason given. so, hey, if you can't find an auditor, pay some law firm to file a "report"
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:50:10
Honestly, I think if it breaks $5k then it's time to start jumping in. I think $3,200 is probably unlikely, but would be a dream.
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:39:12
You are kidding, right?
@_date: 2018-06-03 17:13:48
Stop spreading BS! Pumping does not help anyone in the long run.
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:40:58
yes, and to make matters worse the guy sits on the board of tether's bank!!!
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:40:03
Most sane people have given up on this fake money. Volume is virtually zero. Even the "small" guys can manipulate the price (in both directions).
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:27:02
agreed. but easy to buy into the hype of this ponzi scheme. not planning on doing it any more though. convinced this will be a lot lower in a couple months.
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:10:46
agree. unfortunately, the traders are far outnumbering the good guys. don't see it changing any time soon.
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:22:14
yes. these jumps of a few hundred points are a weak attempt to pump the price. volume is dried up to almost nothing so even a non-whale can manipulate the price now.
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:47:18
you will find that most boards are better when they offer more than 1 opinion (bitcoin is going to $1 gazillion just keep buying).
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:29:28
lol! it appears that your and the rest of the replies to my post are very defensive. that tells me you got in high and keep hoping for the big rebound. saw this first hand in the dotcom bubble. so it's not me who is the bad trader....
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:22:49
why not be realistic?
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:46:10
yes, many times the whales are on both sides of the trade. better get up to speed bro.
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:45:32
a differing opinion is not always fud bro.
@_date: 2018-07-04 02:58:19
"3." is dead wrong. since the financial crisis in 2008 firms have gorged themselves on cheap debt to decrease the number of outstanding shares which artificially inflates earnings. revenues have not grown much in the last 10 years so the fraudsters figured out how to keep the wall street eps game rolling....
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:00:08
made account to express my opinion: bitcoin is going to zero. if you want to take the other side of that trade you are welcome to.
@_date: 2018-07-05 21:12:10
when the father of pumping, tom lee, has to start reigning in his ridiculous price targets you know its gonna end soon.
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:53:06
i assure you no one cares about the technology as it relates to bitcoin. these sharp moves up and down are purely short term speculation for quick bucks. $ is the only thing that matters to these people. the relentless wild pumping of bitcoin is 100&amp; from folks talking their book. they try to justify their price targets with complete nonsense.
@_date: 2018-07-04 13:26:17
coinbase support is literally the worst i've ever used for any company. completely inept. unfortunately, kraken ain't much better.
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:20:22
or i simply sell before it heads too far down and basically keep breaking even. it's a tiresome exercise for no reward. btc has been in a death spiral since december. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:19:36
yes, it feels like new lows are in store. however, yesterday it dropped almost 7% in 2 hours and has made it all back and now gone higher. a hand full of douche bags own most of the coin and take it wherever they want. doesn't seem much different than the federal government manipulating the dollar. the big fish control all currencies, crypto or not.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:28:12
You're kidding about the handful of whales controlling the price, right?
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:35:31
nice. this recent spike from $5,800 to $6,700 on extremely low volume is highly suspicious.
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:59:47
ok, but the fact remains that a few greedy douche bags (labeling them as the smartest is highly debatable) are pumping the price and also shorting the coin for their personal gain. crypto is being manipulated by the few at the cost of many. this runs counter to bitcoins original purpose!!! no one should be controlling the price for personal gain! 
@_date: 2018-07-04 00:22:35
nope. dead wrong. the prices 2 years ago were great. however, your gains have evaporated by 70&amp; and its still falling. could have sold well above 15k all day long. at some point you are going to have to sell or lose 100&amp; seen this movie many times before.  
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:54:31
funny thing is these PNC dirtbags closed my account and refused to supply a reason and that was way before i got involved with bitcoin. pnc is about the worst i've come across.
