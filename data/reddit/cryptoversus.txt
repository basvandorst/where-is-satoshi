Anonymity in a real-life spending scenario (like buying a coffee) is key. I don't want that barista (paid as he might be) to peek into my BTC address and know my balance or other transactions I've made.

Not a bad idea. Monero might be a popular choice (since none of the current options is anonymous) and would be a good addition to the list.

A way to approximate whether someone is dead or not, would be to require an e-mail from a specific address with a specific subject line. Or maybe having someone log into a web frontend (with username and password). 
If that doesn't happen in a specified time frame (and after lots of reminders), we could presume the person dead or incapacitated.

There were (are) a few who said they were "told by management" to start a blockchain project. So they started a pilot.


Not a single technical person at these sessions ever walked away thinking they need an enterprise (permissioned) blockchain. But lot's of non-technical people thought so.
Just to be clear, the above is not only true for Hyperledger but also for Enterprise Ethereum (or any other permissioned and private) blockchain technology.

I tend to agree. It's not just IBM though, all the cloud vendors are pushing some sort of "permissioned" blockchain.
I actually do a bit of professional blockchain consulting for these types of customers. Almost all realize after a few hours of discussion, that they don't need any blockchain for their envisioned use case at all.
