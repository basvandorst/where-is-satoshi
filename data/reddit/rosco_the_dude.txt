Well how about cheap, possible, and will-at-least-give-you-BTC-when-they-say-they-will?
@_date: 2012-11-28 07:05:37
Yeah it wasn't too bad.  I was worried during those five hours, but looking back I know it's not too bad. Plus I'm currently enjoying what I needed the BTC for, so I'm happy.

Hmm I'm looking for it, but I can't find it.  
Edit: Yeah, idk where it is.  Scoured the website, tried google, idk what to do.

Yup, I did wait a full week, and they said I'd get them at 5:00pm "when the bank transfer is complete" or something like that, even though my bank transferred the money over after **only one day.**
Also, I use a credit union, so I'm sure they care a little less about my transaction than a standard bank would.
It's now almost 8:00 pm EST, and no sign of BTC and no reply to my email asking why the 1 week, 5pm deadline hasn't been honored.
Edit: I'm not in *that* much of a rush, I'm just not too comfortable with someone taking my money and saying "yeah I'll totally get back to you at x time" and then *not doing it at all.* Plus, I had a use for those BTC, and I've been wanting to use them ever since I bought them.

In that case I'd need Euros, which I don't have.

Sadly not in EU :-\

I emailed them almost three hours ago. No reply yet...
Hell, I'll pay higher fees for a service that will 1) not surprise me with long wait times until they have my money, 2) at least give me my BTC when they say they will, and 3) take less than a week to process my transaction.
@_date: 2012-11-27 00:55:38
Yeah they don't advertise the one week thing until they already have your money. Complete bullshit. 
And why use the "when the bank transfer is complete" excuse when I can just look at my statement and see that the bank transfer was completed only *one single day* after I bought them?

What about the system?  I'm not saying you're wrong, but my bank gave them my money the very next day.  They have my money, but I have no BTC.
@_date: 2012-11-26 23:59:25
Well, that does explain it.  My fee was small since I needed only a few Bitcoins. Do you have experience with this?  Will I be able to receive/use *anything* today? 
@_date: 2013-02-19 05:59:37
Awesome, thanks a lot.
The address has received them, but my wallet doesn't know it yet

I didn't do this, so I have no idea if this exact article's been submitted before, but did you copy/paste the URL into reddit's search box before posting?
