Naaah, it's actually shockingly cheap to bribe your congressmen.

IT DOES?!

Any moderately intelligent sociopath should be.

I don't understand why noobs wouldn't just leave it on a trustworthy exchange. Like yeah it's not the best idea but it's better than some random web wallet or shady mobile app that nobody has ever heard of.

Shit is getting too real for me.

Hiccups happen.

Exactly. I feel a lot better knowing, if for some reason I need that money now, I can use my Shift card. To me it's basically the same as the debit card for my brokerage account. I don't intend to use it but it's nice to have the option.

Why not? I'd take a corn debit card if I felt like corn was worth investing in.

I find the petty tribalism on both sides entertaining.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:50:07
Actually yeah it does mean that. The market doesn't care about ethics.

How are they making anyone lose money? It's a free market. That's the invisible hand doing what it does.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:57:16
That's kinda what you get with an unregulated purely free market system. It's not good or bad, it's just reality.

That feeling when your country's fiat currency is so worthless you're better off accepting PacCoin.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:53:17
I can't wait

Technically they profit off of every trade but you have a good point.

How are they going to become insolvent with all the free money they're about to get/steal? ;)
