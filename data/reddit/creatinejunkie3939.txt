Bitcoin was very explicitly created to have an average confirmation time of 10 minutes.  At no point ever was anything else suggested.  Long after releasing the whitepaper, Satoshi talked a bit about a fee market developing in a couple decades, but he never thought about the problems associated with an unpredictable fee and unpredictable confirmation times.
We'll eventually have ways to deal with this (maybe the LN), but in the mean time, we're driving away users and putting bitcoin at risk by creating room for a better competitor to gain a foothold.

You're misunderstanding jrat's poorly worded answer.  He wasn't saying the answer is "obvious", but rather that while LN very obviously will successfully work for micropayments, it is ambiguous how it will work for larger amounts of value.  I think the latter is due to channels needing to be open for longer and for more capital to be staking those channels.  e.g. if someone wants to move $20m, how will the LN go about securing financing for such a large transaction?

It's still a positive.  We'd like leaders on every side of the debate to encourage their followers to be civil toward one another.

Why do you think 8 GB would require datacenters?  I can fit **the entire blockchain on a single 1-inch USB**.  Similarly, most full nodes can currently handle 8 MB easily.  My personal internet connection (standard comcast) is 10 MB **per second.**  And of course technology in general improves over time.  By the time bitcoin needs 65 MB blocks, it's likely that most of us will have 100 GB **per second** internet connection or more.

This is false.  I've personally set a fee of $0.07 and had to wait 2 hours for a confirmation.

Patrick Byrne of Overstock and Nasdaq off the top of my head.  Both initially explored using the bitcoin blockchain then jumped ship (Byrne especially reluctantly) when they realized it couldn't support substantial transactions.  I don't have time to hunt for the public statements.  Google is your friend.

I agree, except that you wrote, "bitcoin is not **designed** for fast transactions."  So I was pointing out that it very explicitly **was** designed for 10 minute average confirmation times.  
The people being driven away are companies, engineers, and VCs, not consumers.  A bunch of engineers and company CEOs have publicly stated they're not willing to invest time and money into bitcoin given the uncertainty around it's being able to support meaningful volume.

1 terabyte *a month?*  Why so slow?  What's the bottleneck?
