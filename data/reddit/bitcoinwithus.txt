I agree with multi-sig. In fact, multi-sig wallets are in many ways more secure and safe than a single trezor (hardware wallet). 
Why Blocktrail? I had never heard of them before today. They seem to be an independent group from NL. If their infrastructure goes down, how easy is it to restore from back up?
I ask because I found Copay to be fantastic and quite simple to import from back up, but have never tried switch with a .json backup.

Even credit unions are part of The Federal Reserve System.

Most sites are fun, fast and effective. Delays could only be as long as a new block (so ten minutes).
I recommend look over your options for the best edge by going to  of their recommendations I would highlight NitrogenSports and Cloudbet.

I like the idea of keeping my money separate from my life, that way I might be parted with one without the other.

How do refunds work? Does Coinbase buy back bitcoin at the price of sale or at refund time, or leave in USD?

How are overdrafts handled? Will the card simple be declined? Are there fees associated with overdraft?
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:25:51
No trade fee? Not even 15¢? That would be terrific.

Visa debit cards so, they can be treated as a credit card in some locations.

You realize Circle makes up for the free trade with a spead right?

Does Visas fraud reimbursement account for the BTC price at time of purchase? Does Coinbase cover the differences in case of fraud?

Someone build it in AUR, please. This is so geek, just in time for the holiday week ahead.

What type of KYC does Glidera require?
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:21:23
There are credit unions that offer rewards on debit cards.

Wow.

No open source project I know refers to themselves as an internet firm, mainly because there is no profit in them and thus no taxable liability. 
All that to say, your laws have no power here.

Someone stated they refund in USD at receipt value. So I guess that is a real world hedge.
