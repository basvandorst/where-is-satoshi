And of course you should only build those in an operating system which code you reviewed, along with bios and cpu microcodes. Because motherboard is built from your own design by a custom asic maker which whole production line you can inspect.
Fortunately you have compiler to do the job which you wrote yourself in a machine code so that you can avoid [Ken Thompson hack](
Get real, you don't have time to do security review of open source that you are installing. You just trust developers because e.g. somebody else trusts them to commit source to the kernel tree. 
You cannot live in any kind of society without trust. It's good when it's explicit. But in computer software it's just a lot of hand waving.
Open source is better than closed source from security perspective. It's just the idea of reviewing it yourself and having a sense of security because of that is laughable.

What does it matter. It's a normal company. When your tax office sees some funds transferred from them, tax office can ask them to provide your account data. And the exchange needs to comply. 
If you trade your bitcoins to fiat you're in the fiat world now, and you pay your taxes like you normally do. If you want to be a criminal then you need to be smart enough to be one, instead of asking silly questions about tax evasion on unrelated subreddits.

No, because nobody can force the tesla stock private key from you and get away with almost untraceable money.

Do you lock your car? The likelyhood of somebody checking if it's locked is very low. It doesn't change the fact though that if you lock it, you lower the probability of it being stolen.
Somebody trying to get your crypto private keys from you by force is very low. But when you walk around saying I have a lot of crypto, then even if it's still very low, it's higher.
Does the fact that you bought tesla with btc mean that you have a lot of crypto? No, but it makes the probability of you having it much higher.
You shouldn't worry in any case. Worrying is a waste of time. But choosing actions that align with your goals makes sense (one of which would be e.g. not being robbed). 
I don't know how much in reality it increases chance of owner being in some kind of trouble. But I do think that prob will increase if price of bitcoin increases. If you've seen somebody with bitcoin plate lambo back when bitcoin was around $100/btc, then it's not unreasonable assumption to think that they may have some decent wealth in btc when it's $100k/btc.

Why would anybody ... call it a bubble burst when after going 20x up in one year it goes down 2x back to where it was 2 months ago? 
You know who the biggest whales are? Likely those who are in for the tech. Those who got some bitcoins early and didn't sell them all when they saw 2x, 10x, 100x, and 50,000x "profit".
If you are not comfortable with those price swings then clearly you 1. didn't do the research 2. invested more than you should have.
I can feel sorry for your personal position but when I think of a bigger group of people like you I just think that bitcoins tend to migrate towards smarter hands.

Nothing has intrinsic value. Value is subjective to humans. If there's a stupid rock on a beach and some people decide that they want it then it has some value. If many people want it, then the value is high. If nobody wants it, then it's worthless.

Gee, people, it's 2018 and this is how the world works: if you want something to die, ignore it. This is how things die. 
Works great for shitcoins and other things.
Coinbase btw, did a lot to bootstrap Bitcoin, and I think they should rather be praised than bashed for the amount of transactiotns they are generating. It hurts *their* customers and *their* business, but for Bitcoin it just makes it grow faster. More fees for miners, more secure network. Open for anybody. *Anybody* who is willing to pay the transaction fee is welcome to make a transaction. Whether you like it or not, that's the beauty of it. That's how Bitcoin grows.
For some other things they can be bashed of course. It makes sense to do that if you are a customer and want them to change. Because you really like them. If you don't though, just use whatever service you do like.

It's awesome. But I always wonder if those people consider scenario where somebody is targetting them because of that license plate and using good-ol violence/kidnapping to get private keys to their bitcoins. With wild Bitcoin price increases it seem very likely they still have some wealth stored in them. Even breaking into house works when you know to focus on hard drives and seed lists.
It different from knowing that somebody is just rich, it's knowing that somebody likely has access from home to lots of pretty much untraceable money.

There are a few things you can do:

No, you can't. If you transfer money from somebody else to your bank account you are really far from stealing it. Bank accounts are tied to identities. Bank transfers can be cancelled.

Almost everybody who did some research before buying Bitcoin can feel bad that they didn't bought earlier. The technology is new and proper research takes some time. So after you realize that "yeah, it's really something", the price is likely already higher than when you first heard about it (you usually also need to hear it about it a few times before picking up any interest at all). At this point some people already feel conflicted because "why would I buy it now when it's so expensive". It's a real problem. And that's for those who did the research.
Those who didn't look at the insane gains and create a simple rationalizations in their brains. Too good to be true. That's a fair heuristic before learning more, really understanding it and taking time to think it through. Not everybody is in a comfortable enough position to be able to take time to do that.
And then there are those who bought without doing any research. Like a big part of  of this subreddit. "OH NO ITS GOING DOWN"
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:48:49
Not enough belief in Bitcoin to keep 1BTC and buy slightly worse house with small loan or whatever? I don't understand people who sell **all** their BTC. I've been reading those posts since 2011. Just why. I guess it makes sense if somebody is for getting rich quick and not because he spent some time thinking about Bitcoin.  
Of course one can also keep some BTC telling the world that he sold them all, which is clever.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:07:47
That indeed does not sound good for them. 
For newbies reading this though, if that's the only vulnerability, it doesn't mean that your BTC is completely unsafe. The issue with this one is only if somebody has physical access to your device. Better stick with companies who take security as top priority though. And it's worth noting that trezor has been around the longest so it was likely audited by more people than other devices.

Because marketing, and it's hard to find smaller charities who you can trust. It takes time and can be risky. But it's very possible that with a little research they can have much bigger impact for the same money. GiveWell does something like that but I would suggest  trying on your own. If you do, please post the results on the fund site or here.
You probably could find reasonable people in academic circles to do the research for you .It's a hard  problem and I know you want to donate money not time, but it may be worth it.
Rock on.
edit. In case you need to convert your BTC to USD before donating somewhere, ask some exchange for 0% fee cooperation. They will very likely do it for publicity and these fees matter with this kind of money.
edit2: instead of simply donating say  $1M to EFF ask them to make a double your donation action. So you donate the same amount as somebody else during that period up to $1M. This  will motivate some people.

I don't understand it. Why do you need people. You can generate hundreds of transactions on the testnet using a script. 
If you decide whether or not the project is production ready based on a single test then maybe you reconsider your approach to writing crypto related applications.


Also, without diving into how do you actually implement it, I already think it's misleading. Especially for new users. If somebody knows you address and knows that you gonna make payment later with some amount of bitcoins, he can reason a lot with just this. That's just a super simple example.

Something doesn't add up.
Raising block size simply doesn't work as a scaling solution. It simply does not scale. You raise block 10 times and you can handle only 10 times more transactions which is still shit. On the other hand you are killing decentralization at the same time probably more than by a factor of 10.

But Internet is probably not going away, and while currently there's no incentive to push them, there are technologies to let you mask your Bitcoin traffic in case it would be deemed illegal or smthg.

OK, this one is good. Very good.
edit: But then he is a mad good con. I mean he was clearly nervous on the video. 
Also, one thing that I've been always wondering, Satoshi mentioned at some point that before publishing he presented his idea to some people and they couldn't find any problem with the protocol. I always wondered who would those people be.

Bitcoinity has lower precision by default (more rounding) and is grouping trades with the same rounded price. So at bitcoinwisdom you would have to look more down the list. You can disable grouping on bitcoinity and increase precision in preferences, then you should get the same results unless one of them is indeed doing something wrong.

This doesn't contribute much to decentralization. These will need both security updates and bitcoin client updates. Which must be controlled by some central point if it is to be plug and play.

Let me have my guess. Qualcomm Incorporated.
@_date: 2015-12-09 01:50:48
Let me expand (yeah I'd like to hear more of your thoughts). The way I see it there are basically 2 cases.
1. This very wealthy guy does have a decent knowledge about what's happening around Bitcoin. I mean understanding both technical, about the principles and ecosystem. And he pretty much wants to be seen as Satoshi[1]
2. The whole show is set up (along with guys that asked questions). I don't really understand what could that be used for. Other than distraction. [2]
Both seem very interesting
* [1] The first case is also peculiar because by outing himself, and saying out loud his willing to fight with banks, he puts himself in quite dangerous position. I mean, the Bitcoin isn't really that great for any government. And both his person and supercomputer are under jurisdiction of some government. Outing would make sense however if he knew that it is already obvious for these governments. Then by becoming public he's harder to deal with.
* [2] pointed  out in another thread "Implying to people that you might be the creator of Bitcoin is a method some unscrupulous people have used to gain investment money."
I'm not sure I'm not diving to deep into this rabbit hole, but even if he's not Satoshi, this game that somebody plays is *very* intriguing.

Yes you can do a sybil attack if you control somebody's internet access, and as you mentioned if you have big part of total hashpower and are willing to waste good hours of that to cheat that guy.
But it doesn't work that way on the whole network scale. First, there are some node  ips in the bitcoin client itself. Then there are dns providing most reliable nodes. And then there's list of known nodes that is stored and provided by every participant of the network. How are you going to compromise all that? As mentioned, one sincere node is enough to discard all the rest of them if they don't have 51% hashpower. 
That said, the way IPs are exchanged between bitcoin nodes is far from perfect, some DoS attacks could probably be possible if not for ips provided by central points (code and dns).
And regarding multiple IP addresses, you are correct but client will want to connect to different subnets, so that makes it more difficult (you usually get IP batches in the same subnet).

Yes, the 200k. Legal fees were being paid from other assets liquidation.
When filling out claims there's an option whether you want to receive your shattered dreams remainings in bitcoin or in some other currency. So presumably part of it was or is gonna be sold. But based on the documents until then they were just "secured". There was enough fiat to cover lawyers.

Something that OP came up with. Reading white paper and thinking for 1 minute would probably be enough to understand how nonsensical it is.
What worries me though, is how many upvotes it got. 90 upvotes, 84% upvotes. This 84% are people who don't actually know how Bitcoin works.
Well, maybe it shouldn't be that bad. I guess when Bitcoin succeeds, most people shouldn't have to know how it works.

It still makes me wonder. Guy seemed like he had some knowledge, was subscribed to cypherpunks. I wouldn't say he was stupid. So how did he expect it to play out? Some tax evasion game, maybe, but for that he didn't need to participate in that panel at the conference and in general he could have kept his head down. It was obvious he would be under extreme scrutiny after acting like he's Satoshi. Plus putting himself in danger. Pretty weird.

I think we're in for another wild ride. Following bubbles should be smaller. Currently there is still big questionmark around mtgox coins. If big part of them is being liquidated then it's suprising that price is staying as high as it is.

Come on just an *estimate*, we know it may change. This is crucial chunk of information for those outside Blockstream that are interested in this discussion.
I totally agree that 75% is too low, if some pool doesn't want change and participants want it, they will leave the pool. If 25% of miners really does't want the change maybe we need some thinking.
But it is also important for users to be educated about the situation so that they can take a stand. Miners don't want to mine blocks for the chain that is not appreciated by users. That's why this ETA is so important.
Also, outside sidechains, what other solutions do you see without increasing the block size? Or do you think there is no problem keeping things as they are even if we wouldn't have sidechains (I know it's being reviewed by thy best, but things happen, what if ultimately they won't work = be secure)

There are services that can provide you bitcoin node as a service (or any other API to query info about blockchain and payments). Of course you need to trust them but since your business can't afford any 200GB+ server, it seems that payment amounts would be low enough to make it a reasonable choice. If you don't make many calls many of these services are free. Electrum is also a reasonable choice and not that much different.

Orphan block is not in any way special. You may have up to date node, check your last block, and soon learn that what was your main chain head is in fact an orphan now. 
There is a "rule" like the one you are talking about, and that's regarding accepting payments. Wait for 6 confirmations.
On the protocol level, main chain is clearly defined as the one with the biggest compound amount of work done.

You earn bitcoins just like you earn money. You work and somebody pays you. Or you give somebody some good, or other form of money, and he gives you money.
Don't worry about mining, it's just a way of securing the network and at this point requires a lot of invesment and specialized knowledge. It's kinda as if you wanted a computer and asked "OK, I've heard it's all about a CPU, how do I build one?"

In general yes, but chrome (and ff probably now too, but I'm not sure), have a long bulit-in list of websites which it will only access through https.
In general it usually drops down to human, there's still some assumption of competence, I should be seeing green https when I'm entering my credentials, I shouldn't be opening this random executable file and so on.
But all this is web security. When we are talking about bitcoin mobile wallet they make sure to use ssl and check certificates, so you eliminate human error caused by things like sslstrip.

If you understand Bitcoin, you know it has nothing to do with it, so whatever Mark does, shouldn't influence your opinion about the Bitcoin itself.
So what about the rest? Media don't understand it and they say bad things about Bitcoin in general. Yes they do. They suck indeed. But you cannot optimize for a good look in media because then you end up with modern politics. You end up with people associated with media ripping everyone else off and the rest blindly following. 
It's OK to let everyone knows when somebody is screwing you. But that's not what's happening here. These posts are not from people who donated and feel that their money is spend in the way it was not intended to[1]. It's from people to which this issues should be completely irrelevant and who can spend this time doing something productive instead (installing some existing forum software and letting people know that they can use it?).
*1. Personally I think that even those who donated can just feel bad about it they don't like it. It's not a kickstarter, if you donate to somebody it means you trust him that this money will be well spend = spend on the cause that you donated for*

And it's not fine, but really it's not clear if by pointing it out you are not helping them, because it doesn't matter if you say that earth is flat or that ocean is bottomless.

It's hosted on mtgox.com under mtgox https cert. If it's not done by mtgox and somebody hacked into their server and set it up, and went unnoticed for 4 hours during the middle of Japan day time, then these credentials won't be of any use anyway anymore, because mtgox can no more trust them to auth users.

You don't seem to want to have a rational argument.
But my point was that inflation rate, especially when not measured by government, seems to be roughly the same as interest rates that banks offer you (if not higher). Not to mention the fact of simply confiscating money from bank accounts like it has already happened in the EU. 
Coinbase is not doing that (to my knowledge), but with bitcoin even if you want 3rd party to store your money for you, they still can provide you a proof that this money is not touched. That's far from the fractional reserve banking.

Yes, but once those are mined you stay there forever according to your rule. Even back when you have access to the main chain. Which is ridiculous. 
Sorry for being brutal but dive some into cryptography before trying to invent new better rules for Bitcoin. My intuition tells me that even apart from the obvious flaw mentioned above you would not get this idea if you had something to do with designing similar protocols in the past. And you'll find things which are way more subtle and harder to prove wrong. 
Asking questions "why is it like that" is the way to go though. Don't be discouraged if you don't get many replies in this subreddit. I suggest stack exchange, dev docs, irc and other places. Here you would have to insert some meme for the post to gain some traction.

JPY 772,791,001 (based on the settlement accounts of the bankrupt entity as of

against TIBANNE Co., Ltd. However, TIBANNE Co., Ltd. claimed that the
amount of such loan is different from its understanding and that such amount was
not intended to be repaid, etc. However, along with the aforementioned claims,
TIBANNE Co., Ltd. also indicated its intention to repay such loan after raising
necessary funds. If voluntary repayment from TIBANNE Co., Ltd. is not likely to
occur, I also plan to consider taking necessary legal action.

@_date: 2014-10-22 10:31:09
Well if you can't, you still can invest the same amount of USD that you wanted to invest back then. Even early adopters that were buying around $1 had regrets they didn't buy when it was 100 times cheaper. Also, at $1 it was **much** more risky investment than it is now. Even thought it's still very risky. There was zero economy back then, and spending money on this... project that a bunch of guys is excited about.. seemed like a ridiculous idea.

There's a smooth difference between people telling you to buy when the price is on the longest downtrend so far and people telling you to buy when the price is at the all time high.
The money doesn't come out of nowhere (well, ok, that's not technically correct). In every asset investment to make money you need to invest when you think you know something that others don't. So it's really understanding Bitcoin and its implications vs duuude it's going up!

Main problem is that people are really really really bad random generators.
Other is that it's just password, not data + password. If you are bruteforcing it, then if 1M people use brainwallets, your chances are 1M times higher than if you were bruteforcing specific wallet password.
But mainly it just drops down to really bad randomness. Unfortunately I couldn't find the page/paper which described how many random bits people are able to actually generate per character when they think they are generating something random.

I'm pretty sure most of 40k BTC that were invested on JD were aware of the risk that they were taking. 
Some people treat BTC like an investment, some treat it like money. When you treat it like money, you want to invest it somewhere. And JD was really great for that. It's obvious that no investment comes without a risk.

I've been here since 2010, after $30 high, when it was at a few dollars, everybody was telling me to sell the leftovers and forget about it. It seemed like it was something nice but now it's over.
But you can't escape reality. "Blockchain technology" is useless unless there's a massive mining power and incentive system. Bitcoin is just that. If we are ever going to have a digital commodity, it is bitcoin. You cannot bootstrap anything newer and better, because then after that there will be a new thing. But if we agree that Bitcoin is the thing, then it stays that thing. Yes it is an agreement among humans. But it is our only chance, and personally I think we are past the  threshold. 
The experiment succeeded, and if I weren't been long I would be buying cautiously right now. Cautiously because it's not clear whether mtgox found coins are already being sold are they going to be sold in the future. That's huge amount of coins + there are those stolen funds. It may get **really** low. But that's irrelevant at this point. Bitcoin is here to stay. Not just blockchain technology. Bitcoin.

I don't know why are you assuming I was a SR user. I wasn't.
I'm just interested how this works legally in the US (for which it seems I'm being downvoted). Usually, the case is that you have to know the law, and if you own something, it's yours. "You weren't looking" doesn't seem to be a good enough excuse to me, whether it's checking if you still have it or paying attention to the news.
Of course on the gov part this is a difficult situation to handle not having users contact information (just a guess?), but usually you can't just take somebody else stuff based on your own rules (to which somebody may not have subscribed).

Any clues on why would they suddenly decide to move back there?
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:30:41
Because everybody always work in their own interest. Some people are able to see that they cannot exist without other people, so they include that in the calculation.
In case of pool reaching 50%+ it is not in their best interest since it starts accusation, so even pool themselves are not particulary happy about that. Miners care about their bitcoins value and 50%+ hash power in single hands does not look good for bitcoin, so they have incentive to switch, and they do.
Now traders, traders have no incentive in paying higher fees. So exchange with higher fees will just see lower volume. 
Apart from that, and irrelevant since it doesn't work in general as stated above, but it's not even clear that higher fees = lower volatility. It seems to me that big hands that want to manipulate the market can afford them, while small trades maybe could not. So I'd rather argue that lower fees mean more liquidity and less volatility. 
But that's all just theory. The truth is that bitcoin market is still sooo small compared to wall street, that volatility is just in hands of big money. If they want to move the market, they will.
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:59:30
That's a pity. Probably Coinbase + AML.
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:24:14
If you think that is not going to lower the fees, then do the proper math and show it (based on existing blocks and confirmation times), because it seems to be contrary to what core devs believe. If you do that, it may be a meaningful contribution. I'm just here trying to help some beginner.

Yes, there are legal issues. You would have to think through within which country legal framework are you operating.
1. You deposit bitcoins
2. You upload torrent or enter magnet - say it was 10GB so at their current price it's just 0.005 BTC
3. You can see the download progress and then just click the download button. 
Their download speeds were very good, so for say.... ubuntu distribution ~700MB I wouldn't probably even switch the tab.

Currently fees are calculated based on some formula with constants.
The goal is for them to behave like a marketplace. So that bitcoin client looks at the last blocks to see what fee was required to be included within desired timespan and based on that calculates your fee (and you can pay lower or higher one depending on how urgent is this transaction for you). Some parts of this have already been implemented.
@_date: 2014-08-22 12:45:56

It's similar like with cash. You have to pay your taxes and they will ask you about your incoming bank deposits, but nobody will ask you where did you get that cash when you're buying a TV.
For online retailers they have to ship it somewhere, so there is some link to you. And if you are a bad criminal, and you want to have a lot of money, you won't get a lot of money by buying sofas.
I mean the problem is legit, but it's probably not big enough for them to care about.

Not necessarily. Imagine many companies that allow you to pay everywhere with bitcoin. To offer reasonable service prices these transactions would have to be off the chain.

Not sure why you mention volatility. What you say makes sense when looking at the historical chart, although like in theory and in the long run, more liquidity (more trades), should mean less volatility.

Exactly this. How do people imagine "blockchain technology" to stay without bitcoin? What algo would they use? what about ASICs? Who would pay for that? Would they have to trust some owners? If digital currency is here to stay, if blockchain tech is here to stay, then bitcoin is also here to stay. 
Many things may evolve of course, but if we are ever to have a digital commodity it's going to be Bitcoin.

Except that you cannot create another VISA or Mastercard because of all the regulations and banks. It's a free market, if open solutions will be preferred by users then they will win. 
Decentralization is too expensive so abstraction layer on top that can provide instant payments and optionally refunds is a good thing.

In all seriousness though, if you talk with coinbase for example, maybe they can allow funding for employees accounts from bank account that doesn't belong to them? (I guess normally this is a problem because of AML, but in this case it would always be the same account)

Anybody that thinks the bubble wasn't "real" doesn't understand how markets work.
It could be 90% of volume. If people would not want to buy at that price, it wouldn't go up. Simple as that. Arbitrage between exchanges always worked well.

My 2 cents:
* make price really high
* state clearly these are sponsors, companies that donated money to fundation, but are in no way associated with it, they did something for bitcoin community but you don't vouch for them
* and then, if scam gets on the list, well at least they left some money for the bitcoin community 
I don't think you are able to screen them, unless you radically cut the number of such sponsors basically leaving only those in the  web of trust of  core members of the fundation (which obviously cuts off many startups). 
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:44:44

But it's all about having founds on your card in Bitcoin. Bitcoins should be sold at the moment of purchase. 
Of course that's very difficult and provider would need to take some risk.

Nobody would notice, and nobody would care. If SHA-256 has a flaw and blocks can be solved faster, then the only problem is for ASIC miners who need to update their hardware. Network security is intact.
If ECDSA is broken it is irrelevant for you if you are not reusing addresses since public key is hidden under RIPEMD. But something like ECDSA being broken would cause worldwide Armageddon and would be quite noticable. It's not just Bitcoin. And that's the point from which we agree on a new function.

That's not true. You just hear about every bitcoin theft as opposed to people losing money in the banks every day. There were many incidents were people were robbed through their credit card and bank won't refund because the pin was used (c'mon, 4 digits, and you can buy these in thousands). And the story from my close friend who lost (not that big) sum of money because somebody gained access to his online bank account. Bank did not refund. They said it was transferred somewhere too fast and it was too late to try to undo the transfer. They won't tell you how it happened. It's not newsworthy. But it happens. 
That said, if you have a know-how I think taking care of your own bitcoins yourself is way better. But in cases of non-technical people trusting 3rd party may be a good idea. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:55:08

How many connections did your bitcoin-qt had at the time of transaction creation?

In this one you seemed to be asking about the delay that  is necessary because otherwise it would be possible to generate payments and only pay when price swings down.

I think just big mining operators receiving new hardware. 
It may still grow and it may become more than 51%. Mining is less profitable for small miners and works better for people doing it on a large scale. These people have no interest in joining mining pools.
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:55:36
I'm not advocating public wifis, but do you have any specific threat in mind? Bitcoin protocol is safe on any network if you wait for confirmations and don't have somebody owning huge amounts of hashrate nearby, and all mobile clients use SSL connections and verify certificates.
edit: regarding hashrate, somebody would have to isolate you (difficult unless he owns the network) and then mine one or a few blocks, so the cost of cheating you is at least $15,000 per block

I agree that volatility may be an issue for some people. But it's different kind of issue. It's not some entity robbing you, it's more like you bought some real estate and its price went down. It happens, and if that's a big problem for you then yes I think that's a valid case where somebody would prefer to trust a bank (not with some bigger money and especially not in EU though).

Consumers install browsers that they use to connect to these banks. Most of these are open source.

If there's any chance that somebody will cover the some losses, or you will be able to take it back after few years, after they earn it through fees, then technically it's not "lost", just temporarily unavailable.
But yeah, sounds a bit optimistic.
edit: OTOH:


@_date: 2014-02-21 13:04:28
It's nothing new. Here's how it works
* scenario one: tx malleability occurs, bad guy contacts support, gives them txid, they check it and it's not in the blockchain, "oh we are sorry, we must have done something wrong, we are resending you the funds"
* scenario two: mtgox software automatically checks if tx got into the blockchain, and if it didn't after X blocks/time, it creates a new transaction
Obviously in the first case it's easier to realize something bad is going on (unless you are thinking ahead and have some automatic alerts for the second scenario)
@_date: 2015-05-22 09:58:43

As with any savings, diversify.
If you don't feel technically confident enough to take care of your own funds, then ok, you can trust 3rd party. But take out at least 20% (insert here estimated probability of losing it by your incompetence vs your trust in coinbase)   and try to secure your own cold storage carefully following instructions on the internet. It's not that hard, and if something bad happens you still have something left.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:12:07
I would assume average customer service person doesn't have much idea about how bitcoin works. But even if he did, it's really not obvious unless you dig down into it and you know about tx malleability. I think they didn't even look at the blockchain, just pasted txid into some internal tool. 
The thing they could notice were suspicious amounts and frequency of such tickets.

Regarding mining decentralization, it's not just orphan rates. While bandwidth is gonna be increasing over time, latency, not so much. So you get higher orphan rate when you are far away from the biggest miners. It could lead for example to centralization of most mining power in China. Majority of the mining power under single government doesn't seem healthy. It may happen anyway by the way, which worries me a bit.

Wow, you're right. I always assumed that broken ECDSA is something from which we cannot really recover. Given how much money people have in Bitcoin there would be big incentive to keep Bitcoin alive with protocol upgrades instead of say switching to some altcoin (that would be using something different, but for now we don't even seem to have anything better than EC).

Nothing has intrinsic value. Everything that value is, is that some people find it valuable. There's a growing group of people who understand the technology behind Bitcoin and it's implications and they are very much convinced about it's usefulness now and in the future. Most people are just in to get rich quick. At some point, thanks to the technology gold/silver may become pretty much worthless (not saying that it could happen any time soon). At some other point Bitcoin can become worthless too. At another one, human life can also become worthless (welcome tho the post singularity world). Things are subjective. 
Peter is confused because he would have to rebuild his whole precious metals world view to accept Bitcoin, and it would make it much more complicated and less clear. It's much simpler for him to just deny Bitcoin.

Thanks for the link. I haven't read it before. I will read some more but after reading the first post, I think it wouldn't change much. Stats can be gathered and on the long run, you can see that the pool is not in fact robbing his users. Probably also something similar to proof of bitcoin solvency could be used then by pools to help them be more credible. The big(gest) pool simply seems to have no incentive to cheat its users. 
So not to be a guy that is just bitching, I think incentives are most important. Pools have incentive to be as big and as efficient as they can get. So if some big Bitcoin holder doesn't like that he could donate daily some small amount to p2pool users, and maybe after some time it would turn out it is more profitable to mine using p2pool than some centralized one (and then if many miners move there would be even better to join it since variance would be lower).

Anyway the actual voice comes from users. As a long time holder you probably wouldn't upgrade to a client with such change. Me neither. I don't think that many people who find Bitcoin exciting would.

Value per bitcoin is completely arbitrary unless you take into account total number of coins. If there would be to be 21B bitcoins in existance (instead of 21M) and current price would be $0.55 it would be the same as it is now. It's just naming arbitrary numbers. 1 bitcoin could mean 100,000 satoshis instead of 100,000,000 of them

@_date: 2014-08-21 16:20:28
I'm sorry you are being downvoted so badly, you're making good points.
In some cases, it still worth to do these extra steps. Apart from transferring money between countries, sellers often pay CC/paypal fees as high as 3-5%. On bitstamp trading fee is 0.2%. So seller can give bitcoin discount, buyer can spend and then buy, and they still end up with more money than going through credit card payment or paypal.
Another point is not liking the idea of sharing your CC details. They get leaked all the time, and with BTC you are always in control of your money (if you want to).
And lastly some people just do it to help bootstrap the bitcoin economy. Once it's bootstrapped, bitcoin payment processors that do transactions off-chain can offer much better fees that current payment processors. That's because it's really an open market unlike say current credit card market which is filled with regulations and standards owned by big companies. You can create bitcoin payment company in your garage, but you cannot start an alternative to VISA. More healthy competition = better price for consumers.

What is getting displayed also cannot be centralized.
You need to have a network of trust (e.g. built automatically based on what you upvote). And moderation happens based on weights from your network. So in the end based on who they upvote and downvote different people will see different messages. If the network is well built e.g. by adding manual connections of people who you 100% trust or people who you consider to be spammers, sock puppets end up in their own bubbles loosely anchored to those who found their content valuable.  
It is a very hard problem.There will be legit accounts that were sold (which you could cut off from your network if you are aware of that). But it is doable.

You are really green in my RES so I'm surprised by our opinion. 
There is a clear outcome in less than a year. If somebody is  convinced which side wins he can put money where his mouth is, and make some money in the meantime.
It's not just some altcoin with highily questionable future. The result here is going to be pretty binary. It's a bet in a pure form.
I just wish there would be a way to organize this thing in non centralized manner ahead of the fork, so that you don't have to keep your money on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-03-31 22:51:05

Not sure why you think I'm against a compromise.
Compromise cannot be achieved though by some bystanders. Developers and miners can talk with each other and achieve compromise. Our discussions or reddit, not really. 
Somebody from the outside could suggest some brilliant idea that helps with the conflict, yes (unlikely, because how Bitcoin actually works matters, and not many people from the outside can grasp it). But the conflict has been going on for so long that's it's really hard to come up with one (most options have already been analyzed), and I don't remember seeing any lately.

What security measures are there to avoid revealing private key without destroying it? In the video it looks like it's just a path being broken, plus easy access to the chip's pins.
Only use case I can think of where this kind of security is not important is when you want to generate a private key to store bitcoins in a way that the private key doesn't touch your computer. HW guarantees it, so that's great, but it wouldn't be sane to put any reasonable amount of bitcoins in there without ability to backup. And there doesn't seem to be any way to do it? 
Remember kids, always have backup of your private keys.

If you want to have something competitive with current products, which is 16nm, then just the ASIC development (with mask) would probably be a few million bucks. 
But it's not like you can throw a millions of bucks at it and get it instantly. You can't design and deploy an ASIC with enough hash power within a timeframe that would be relevant to the latest discussions if you start now.

I think 90% of current discussion between the two sides is completely unproductive. And irrelevant. It should be way more technical and with more concrete arguments. 
Ultimately Bitcoin does what is supposed to. Consensus is achieved and rational players stick to the longest chain. Miners optimize for their future profits. Monopolies can be broken with more efficient players. If human disagreement can break Bitcoin, it wasn't worth fighting for in the first place.

What does BU have to do with this? I understand that SW fixes transaction malleability but the issue doesn't seem to be directly connected to the block size?

Of course. There's no reason to let every Bitcoin user in the world know that your are buying a cappuccino.
Small payments in layers on top can even be somewhat centralized making them super cheap and fast. But you don't keep more bitcoins in those layers than you would carry in a wallet.

Trezor, cold wallet created on a computer that will never again touch the internet.
You can't secure your computer against state actors. If they really want to access it, they will. 
edit: well,  I mean re cold wallet, that computer could have been compromised when you were installing the software, so it could still generate you some weak private key, but you can kind of do it manually, e.g. test if hash functions work properly then use them along with some external source of randomness.. just use Trezor I guess (or similar)

There are people who know much more than me about this but consider this:
You add a single unused mos with gate not connected to anything. I  think you can find those on chips for various manufacturing reasons. Now since it's not connected you would think it would not be able to turn on. If you place it strategically thogh, then put a singnal line in appropriate place and if you put signal with appropriate frequency through that line, you will be able to charge this transistor gate by EM field changes. Only if you know this you will be able to flip this bit in this way non-obvious way. 
And that's just some example that is possible to understand for people outside ASIC design. Basically even if you could, auditing it would be even harder than auditing binary of a huge software because there's additional level of physical phenomena some of which you won't even catch in simulation. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:54:03

Scale matters. And money follows power law distribution. So there will be one or two investors with much more money than others and they domination can last pretty long. Hoping that others catch up is no different than hoping for other players to enter the mining business now.
Miner(s) that are the biggest currently are going to be ahead of everyone else having ASIC supply chain and their existing infrastructure. Power and cooling are big. They already have it in place.

That reasoning (market cap moving away from bitcoin then coming back, potentially) would work with perfect liquidity, i.e. all coins available to buy sell on the market. That's far from the case here.

Big blocks. In 2011 it was already pretty clear to everybody who thought things through that we're gonna be scaling and buying coffees through abstractions on top.
Attacks. Mining centralization is a huge problem for Bitcoin that does not have a clear solution. Monopolies are created by natural power law distribution. It is a serious issue, but incentives still work towards bright Bitcoin future. And I really hope there are already at least a few serious companies all over the world that will bring the next generation of truly distributed ASICs.  Heaters which don't pay for electricity they consume are so 2017.
Public opinion. It changed a lot. For better. There's still psychological problem for many that "I've already heard about it when it was at X, now it's too expensive". It's not easy to overcome. It's causing psychological defensive rationalizations like "it's just a scam"
Exchanges. I thought that by this time the quality would be better. Turns out that heaps of money are not that easy to translate to great software.
New creative ideas. Maybe I'm not listening carefully enough, but there aren't seem to be many. We had namecoin, ethereum idea was from the early days and eth provided somewhat decent implementation. Anonymity solutions like zcash improved, which is great. Mining pools, hardware wallets - ideas like this push Bitcoin forward a lot.
Payment system. Now that LN is lunching I hope somebody will create a decent PoS system which allows merchants to accept bitcoins for coffee. Things are only getting created when there's an incentive. The price increase is making fees look more expensive so it may be just the right incentive for abstractions on top to bloom.
Well in general, somewhat boring. I just wrote this post. Nothing really big and exciting. Renting satellites to stream transactions is nice, but I'd rather have Bitcoin micropayments based mesh networks in big cities. The technology is already there, there's just no incentive. As long as centralized Internet works and poeple can access their FB, they are fine.
I'm somewhat sorry about producing this heap of text. But I would feel even worse if I would not press submit now.

It's profitable at the current price. After you mine a block you need to wait 100 more before you can sell it. By then it may turn out it wasn't profitable after all. 
Because of how Bitcoin difficulty works, on the long term profitability will always be oscillating around zero. So from strictly short term economical view, mining BCH just has more variance. It's a gamble.

I don't think there's a truly ASIC resistant algo. As long as we keep improving the hardware, somebody will focus on improvements towards this specific algorithm if there's enough incentive.
I'm not very familiar with equihash. The white paper says "increases the computations
by the factor of 1000 if memory is halved.". Is there some upper limit to memory needed? It seems that servers with hundreds of gigs of RAM would  have a huge advantage over the rest of the network. But I'm assuming that's just my lack of understanding.
Don't get me wrong, I'd like to see PoW change. I just don't see any realistic scenario where that happens. And I'm talking just about technical reasons. There's also social aspect. It would be really hard hard fork. Bitcoin ecosystem relies on Bitcoin businesses (payment processors, exchanges some wallets etc.). Businesses optimize for money. And there would be a lot of money at stake for some people. So from social perspective it would be quite an armageddon. Not even comparable with what's happening currently.

In theory, borrowing coins from somebody and paying them back in 100 blocks should work (of course you will need to pay for that).
That's a short in theory, but the way margin trading is organized on exchanges I'm not sure if that wouldn't turn into even more gambling. 
Also you probably don't want to always short. Deciding when to do that and when not is a gamble again. I'd guess that as a miner, you want to minimize variance and eliminate as much fees as possible.
But I'm just giving arguments not to mine as asked by parent. Surely there are some to do that. Maybe switching between chains is not as expensive as I think. I admit that the short idea is neat.

It's not bollocks, it's statistics. Your intuition tells you 100 is enough. It could happen that it will get confirmed in the first block and then you think you were right. But there can be an empty block mined by antpool and then you rationalize "well it couldn't have been mined here". But it's still a block. What's currently in the mempool also matters. 
Jochen charts are great, but it's hard to see all the colors and do a reasonable estimation based on that. 
In other words, you set the fee yourself and if you do an educated guess in many cases you will be right. You wanted confirmation in N blocks and you got it. But if you would do statistics of how often you were right, and send the same transactions based no the fees from 21.co, it will turn out that these predictions were more accurate*

This is not a good way to set your fees. It may vary from block to block and from miner to miner.
Reasonable wallets check stats for confirmation time from last N blocks. Based on that you get better approximate confirmation time for given fee than just looking at the last block.
Bitcoin core has estimatefee command, other wallets let you choose priority or you can check a website like this one: 
This is much more reliable than scenario described above which is timeconsuming and error prone (you don't know if this transaction is not an input to some transaction with higher fee, you don't know how long has it been in the mempool, you should also check the size and so on)

While it probably wouldn't work currently, on the long run, big merchants/exchanges could cooperate with miners that they think vote in their favor.
Instead of broadcasting transactions on the network, they could send them directly to these miners, and only say 30s later broadcast it to the network. Time could be longer in some cases where instant appearance of the transaction is not very important. Then these miners would earn a bit more fees than others, so there would be financial incentive to switch to voting that is preferable by users.

OK, so how are you going to prevent me from voting 1000 times?
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:42:50
Yes probably it does.
The way i see it there are two paths.
1. Blocks get bigger. More tx = more fees to collect.
2. Blocks don't get bigger or even if they do, most small transactions move to sidechains or abstractions on top of blockchain (centralized merchant solution can be implemented at lower cost than decentralized ones). 
Even if small transactions move away from the main blockchain that has little to do with the storage of value part of Bitcoin (which to me is even more important than the payment network, since the latter, as mentioned, can have other implementations).
And since somebody will mention it - these abstractions on top that are not centralized - isn't that thing that we are escaping from with Bitcoin?  No, it's way different. You are still in control of your money. Your account in this centralized system is like a wallet that you carry around with you. You can have some money there, if you lose it, well, different providers will take care of it better next time. 
Because there can be lots of different providers. Unlike banking system and credit card companies, we can have free market here where few guys in a garage can implement some new, successful solution. You don't have that with banks, you can't just create a new credit card company. 
Underlying common protocol and value stored in Bitcoin makes it possible. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 10:02:52

Which trial process? Bankruptcy committee has been working on distributing funds mechanism with kraken for some time now.  Users could  choose if they prefer to get bitcoins or fiat.
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:10:17
Relax. Whether some people want to believe it or not, we're past the experiment part. Different things may shape its future, but Bitcoin is here to stay. 
Taking some time to think about the problem of decentralized currency, issue of initial distribution and trust in it, that's all there's needed to stay calm.
Do you think that in the future value will be stored as digital currency? Think hard and come to some strong conclusion.
If the answer is yes, then the value must persist even if currency evolves and technology changes. If it wouldn't do that in case of Bitcoin, you wouldn't be able to trust any newer one because at some point it may also get deprecated. So if we are to use ones and zeros as storage of our wealth, the value that is stored currently as Bitcoin must stay.

huh? I don't remember any downtimes
@_date: 2015-08-29 20:01:48
OK, you're right currently inflation at the beginning is also higher (but is going down way faster than in your case).
But when you buy bitcoins e.g. when only 1/4 of bitcoins are mined, then you know that due to inflation they can only lose value 4 times. 
When mining lasts forever though, then you know that due to inflation at some point they will lose value 10, 100 and 1000 times. 
Do you think people would jump in early knowing that? I doubt that. I know I wouldn't.
Long period of time to gain traction is also difficult. You don't just suddenly jump into technology that is around for 10 years but nobody is using it (and since nobody is using it, it probably has a lot of bugs)
Besides, even if your assumptions were correct (and I don't think they are) then on the long run, as you explained, this 50BTC would be pretty worthless to miners.

Say you have 10BTC. You want to use them as a safe storage of value. If you took some basic steps to protect them, they are not easy to take away from you. Now if amount of bitcoins keeps increasing, then with every year your 10BTC is worth less. Because total bitcoin market cap is being split into more bitcoins. If there would be 10x more bitcoins, then value of 1BTC. would equal to current value of 10BTC.
And for many people storage of value part is the most important part of Bitcoin. But it only works if total amount of bitcoins is known in advance.

Yup, 26.6 / 5000 = $0.005. It was much higher price already when BitcoinMarket appeared and it became tradeable. Mining them back then seems like a more plausible story.
But well, whatever gets them clicks. This kind of story is not very insightful anyway. Also, seems kina weird to be enough crypto oriented to get them in 2009 yet not enough to keep your mouth shut.
@_date: 2015-08-27 20:46:39
Seems like a possibility (not described in the draft though). Well let's wait and see.
In the meantime though, blocks including these specific strings are clearly supporting this draft, so it's not just guessing.

OK guys, context is a good thing.
This guy is one of the first ones to actively promote bitcoin. He started accepting it, put it on the billboard, and invested a lot of money helping bitcoin to grow.
The video was also something that community wanted him to do, to know what's happening. He checked that fiat funds were there, because that was the thing in question. He is not lying in this video. It turns out (well we still have a lot to learn, bet there's some willy bot information) that liquidity problems were on btc side. This was not verified and he's not claiming that in the video here.
It's still shitty, not sure how much he had access to, it seems at that point mtgox was already operating at loss, spending more than earning, but I suppose he was just checking if balance on the account fits what gox was reporting was due to customers.
I wonder how they could prove to him how much fiat was due. 
Anyway, mentioned [doxxing]( was definitely bad, he's definitely not a saint, but remember about looking at the whole picture.
Even assuming later fuckup (which I don't think is the case) we wouldn't be where we are today without this guy.

Dude, learn to disagree respectfully. 
I'm not an XT fan, I really don't like some of his ideas, but Mike did fucking a lot for Bitcoin development. Just bitcoinj itself enabled tons of projects that helped bitcoin to grow that were based on its codebase.

Peter, you're a smart guy and most things I hear for you are very rational.
Comment about Gavin may be rational too, but you seem to be ignoring the social aspect. 
Apart from being a brilliant protocol, Bitcoin, ilke everything else, also has a human factor. That is, it only has its value because of people who think it's valuable.
Even if you gather bunch of super smart, rational people they will have some disagreements. But I think it's important we remember about our common goal - having this great thing that the Bitcoin is working.
If you want him removed maybe just contact him sharing your view, I mean, on both sides there's a lot of smart people who are capable of thinking rationally and distancing themselves from emotions (I think). He could have came to a conclusion that yes, that may be an ok idea now that he's focusing more on XT. 
But weighting social aspect in, is it really something necessary? Do you seriously consider this as big security issue? He had access to everything from the beginning, like many popular people is targeted by any black hat who wants bitcoins, he hasn't screwed up yet. 
Yes, I think deleting these was stupid. I also think that your comment about removing him is stupid.
Stupid not as irrational, but stupid as ignoring social aspect. Bitcoin has grown. Development discussions are hard, it's not a sterile environment anymore, it should be open but you are also watched  by thousands of people. 
Maybe it's optimal to sometimes not take a shortcut and waste some energy on maintaining this social factor. To play it down and don't say anything toxic directly since in these discussions both sides are capable enough to get the point anyway.
Community is important. You guys have put thousands of hours into this project and know that your opinion is gold, and incomparable to random comments on reddit or elsewhere. It's true. But we need more guys like you. People who are willing to spend thousands of hours playing with this technology, just because they think it's great and it's fun*. People don't jump in the middle of a battlefield for fun.

@_date: 2017-11-23 20:12:45
Fair enough. But I don't think encouraging people to invest their money based on what they read in any specific subreddit is a good idea. That's how you get bubbles and people who don't want to touch exciting technology because they got burnt. 
Asking about what percentages you should have in your portfolio is not that much different than asking if these currencies will go up or down. Nobody knows. But what's fun about crypto is that you can read about it, there's tons of info available to public. Source code, docs. Then you can reason about it. And then statistically, on the long run, money stays in hands of those who are best at reasoning. 
Otherwise it's just gambling.

Ok, not slowing down, making transactions slightly more expensive. 
It's not really a problem yet, but still just one guy with not really all that much money can force people to wait longer or pay more.

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:46:08
The fact that it succeed and we got so far is a black swan. You just consider it to be a thing, but even back in 2011 it was so very fragile that even when you understood the technology and implications, a success story that it had so far seemed like a very unlikely scenario.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:46:44
Ver's BTC moving. That means he may be willing to sell them for BCH, which could lead to BCH price increase, especially that it is likely he won't be pumping it alone.
Until his BTC stash moved, it was a reasonable assumption that BCH pump will wait for these coins.
I believe gmaxwell is not the only holder trying to time his moves wisely. 
With  every Bitcoin drama comes a slight shift of bitcoins. A slight shift to slightly smarter hands.
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:47:12

Bitcoin is a set of rules. 
Computers use this set of rules to exchange information between each other. They also verify other computers play according to the rules. 
One of those rules says there won't be more than 21M bitcoins (simplifying, but that's the implication). 
You can have a different set of rules meaning you will have a different cryptocurrency.

OneName data store is public. When you are using them as a service they can easily be replaced by something else that is using the same data store (blockchain and DHT AFAIR?).
Even if that would turn out to be problematic, you can just do all lookups, migrate to namecoin, use both for some adaptation period and then leave them behind.
The project is open source. The devs need to eat something while coding. If they screw up real bad, it will be forked.

There can be and will be tons of them. Thanks to sidechains maybe you will be even able to transfer your value to them. They can also be used to track value stored in something else (e.g. stocks, domains).
But it's impossible for them to gain value based on digital currency scarcity if there is to be such thing in the future. Because once you start creating new ledgers as storage of value, you ruin scarcity. 
So if we are going to have value based on digital currency scarcity in the future, it's going to be the value currently stored in Bitcoin.

Guys like these can find crucial vulnerabilities while not getting caught. They can do whatever they want with them, exploit them or make some money. Instead, they choose to report them, basically doing hard work that the company should have done. That's white hat.
If they get caught doing it, they can suffer painful consequences. Because there's no way for them to prove their intent. But nevertheless they do it to report it afterwards. 
There are some smart companies that reward that instead of punishing, but sure we can pretend everything is secure because some company said so and just leave all exploiting to 3 letters agencies and black hats. 
And yeah, I agree that election votes don't actually matter much.. but you know, if you see guy whose job is to oversee voting, filling out forms and putting them into the urn one after another, you could feel tempted to report it. Just for kicks.

If you pay high enough fee, your transaction should be included in the blockchain.
High enough is decided by what miners are willing to mine.
If group of miners would try to artificially raise tx cost, then single miner outside that group could profit by mining all these transactions. 
So if miners are rational and are optimizing for the highest profit, everything works as it should, transactions are included in blocks based on their fees that are just right based on the current network load. If on the other hand miner is not rational, then he is earning less than rational miners, so on the long run he should be gone (I think this business will stay very competitive with not very big profit margins).

When you don't get 502 or 504 or 500 or just a red box, they literally write "your order may have failed" like, we don't know dude, have no idea what happened to your order, maybe check orders list and figure out for yourself?

It's just not really ready for microtransactions. It still can be solved without changing Bitcoin by more centralized abstraction layers on top (these are way different form of centralizations than in fiat world, free to compete between each other and so on).

You don't seem to understand. Some people don't spend their day on reddit looking for good books to read. They don't sit and watch Peter Shiff youtubes. They work their ass of eleven hours and then take care of house and their children. They do that so those kids have easier life. They don't go on vacations, they put money on their saving account. And then somebody fucking robs them. 
If somebody comes at you on the street with a knife and asks for your wallet then you also think it's your fault that you didn't practice martial arts?
You can have bitcoins gold and silver. Somebody comes to your house, puts a gun to your head and get what he wants or you die. And then some fucker on reddit laughs at you that you had such a weak security installed at your home.

Well I guess the "crashing" part need to be addressed anyway. If I understand correctly this still just makes the cost way higher (which is of course the only way to differentiate DoS from legit txs, but crashing should be out of the question no matter what happens on the network).
If the mempool would just keep the predefined (or dynamic) size evicting the cheapest priorities it seems that as memories get bigger over time bitcoin network also gets able to handle bigger number of unconfirmed txs. 
Of course I don't follow dev closely enough to have any valuable opinion, I'm just curious why this and not that, being afraid that the more rules we have, the more probable it is that some of them will get exploited. Or that some weird special case with happen. And it seems harder to keep things behaving the same across different implementations.

I don't think anybody can say with confidence if that will happen or not. There are just too many factors.
I strongly believe that it won't and that Bitcoin future is bright. We haven't had an asset like this ever in the whole human history. There are many people who are not planning to sell. Volatility and "crashes" seem  to be shaking of weak hands i.e. those who are in for a quick buck. 
And slowly increasing price can be achieved even without spectacular success. Inflation rate is low, IMHO the rate of bitcoins being lost is probably higher than those being mined already.
And then there's a question. Or two. I'll leave it to you as a homework. 1. Do you think that in the future, we will have a digital asset like Bitcoin? Of any kind? Not electronic account with 3rd party trust, but a truly digital store of value. 2. Do you think it will be Bitcoin? (consider scenario when it's not and how did that happen and how safe you feel about your stored value)

It's still ridiculous. They don't even know what they are talking about. If I computer SHA256 on a computer in that city is that illegal? How about if I do that two times? What exactly do they deem illegal? How did they put that in law? "Well officer I'm just lending my computing resources to this mining pool".  And if I use heater with open window is that also illegal? 
I'm getting a bit fed up with tons of regulations (not even talking about Bitcoin) that are added every day even though they often logically don't even make sense. Lawmakers are clueless but they don't care. With amount of regulations you can find something for anybody.

I usually don't care about Ross (yeah, sorry the earth is pretty big), but did you even take a look at the link you are commenting on? 
Guy was only convicted for creating a website, for 2 life sentences without parole. Psychos who actually murdered people get less. Did you ever see somebody who created a robber mask go into prison? So many of them are used by criminals! And it's really hard to make an argument for the trial being fair. It's marketing. "Don't fuck with us". He is being sacrificed to scare others. Not exactly in the way that law should work? Who cares, everybody involved in taking him down gets a medal and a pat on the back. 
I'm not saying he's innocent, but I hate that so very often guys that really did not really harm others get crazy sentences only because it's something that thy system is afraid of. It's the same story with "hackers", ddosing, or a guy who cut a cable to the datacenter.
Meanwhile actions of many high political figures, bankers or other gov officials that directly harm lifes of others go without any punishment whatsoever.
It pretty much always was the case. The system always has flaws. But it was done behind the scenes. Because otherwise people would riot. But nowadays, so much of this stuff is out in the open. All these leaks and *-gates. Few comments on reddit with rage and we move on, "what are you gonna do". This is going in some very dark dystopian direction.  To end on a positive note, Bitcoin is a step in the opposite direction. And it's getting less and less fragile.

You can for example use non-standard order of words. Like 1,3,2,4,5,7,6,8 or whatever comes to your mind.

It's perfectly conceivable that Bitcoin will be deprecated and we switch to some other crypto. But it only can happen (IMHO) through something like sidechains. So no matter for how long  you store your Bitcoin, no matter what crypto is currently most used for transactions, you still keep the value stored. 
If we would ever just switch, then you can't use the new currency as a safe store of value. Because there will come a new one after some time. Actually, many of them, you won't even know which one is going to win. 
I think people underestimate how powerful and crucial for Bitcoin are sidechains and being able to switch to a completely new stack without economical mess.

If somebody lost X BTC, it will only affect the price at the point were he would have sold them if he would still have them.
There's no magic connection that makes price go up the moment somebody loses coins. It's just that on the long run these coins are never going to be sold. There will be less supply. It doesn't affect demand so the price goes up then. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:06:34
Yes, it's possible that it will go down some more. Or that it will go up. And yes, there are some charts around the earth that if you adjust time axis and y axis just the right way, and cut out the appropriate part, bear some resemblance to the BTC price chart.

Supply is not total amount of coins in circulation. It's only coins currently offered on the market. 
Look, you're in this sub, you're thinking about issues like this, clearly you're not stupid. Just read some about supply and demand in general and take some time to think this through.
The thing that may be messing with your head is that if suddenly 1M of Satoshi coins moved, the price may go down. That fits what you have in your head. But in this scenario, price goes down because there's expectation of those coins hitting the market and joining the supply side. And market reacts as soon as there's information that something may happen in the future. 
Other than that, it's not like people think the price should be X because Y coins are lost. People sell and buy at the best price that's currently available to them.
I do appreciate this kind of posts compared to memes even if I disagree with what's presented in them.

Yeah, no use trying to convince the reddit hive mind. Bill is a really smart guy and he doesn't just say random things. He's mindset is currently mostly philanthropic. 
When you really understand Bitcoin and how  disruptive it really is there are some reasons to be scared. It's a fantastic revolution that should be great on the long run, but short term many changes in society can be problematic to many people. Just like losing money on exchanges is - something that people are not used tot in a fiat world. Or extortion which works much better with crypto than with fiat. 
But on both sides people usually go "lalalalalala". Those who missed out cannot accept that Bitcoin may be something as big as the Internet, those who bought blindly don't want to have any doubts.

See, you're just throwing some random words around. There's no segwit 2.0. There's segwit2x which has nothing to do with the upgrade of the segwit itself.
Don't try to time the markets. Don't base your trades on random  reddit replies. If any information about the Bitcoin's future is already public, then it's already reflected in the price. 
I encourage you to jump into the rabbit hole and learn, it's fun. I'll need tons of time and patience. Then you can understand what potential protocol changes are awaiting. And contribute.
But if cryptography and spending weeks diving into some  project are not your thing and you just want to get/sell some bitcoins, then just set yourself a schedule (that many per week or whatever) and don't try to guess what's the price is going to do next.

It was a shortcut, so that the clever ones can expand the idea for themselves. Let me do that for you. 
There are more people like me. People who strongly believe in this technology. I say I want to buy at $0.0001, somebody else is fine with $0.001, and this guys comes and say he will actually pay $0.01. Oh, we are building the bid side of an order book. The point is, while it maybe could happen in 2010, currently Bitcoin going to zero is just not an option. Not within our lifetimes (added this because you know, entropy and stuff). It's past the tipping point and at this point it is safe to say the experiment was a success.

It's a new way to organize transactions in blocks. You can't easily explain piston rings to somebody who has just learned about existence of cars.
You don't really have to care about it as a user at all. You will move forward its adoption if you use wallets that support it, but this needs to be done behind the scenes for users to avoid confusion. Otherwise it's as if  spreadsheet was asking you "hey which algo do you want to use to sort this column?".

It helps not just with GFW. OpenSSL was removed from Bitcoin because we needed to make sure all nodes agree on what's valid and what's not plus libsecp is optimized (of course I would not suggest using openssl, there are better options now). New versions of TLS are not broken. But even if it would be completely compromised you are back to where we are now. It's additional layer of security. It's good to have many of them.
Building trust based on peers behavior is one thing, but you may also prefer your ISP not to see the transaction you're broadcasting (he sees which one are going in, so he knows which one is yours) or interfering with the traffic in any way.

Correct. The discussion is about what do you base that decision on. 
* you have in depth technical knowledge and participate in development so that you have educated opinion on what is the best for the Bitcoin on the long run?
* you look for an option that will bring you short term investment profit?
* you check count of different types of nodes?
* you base it on your web of trust, e.g. I know this dev is sane, I'm following his advice?
* you follow the chain with the most work? 
* you follow what's the most popular in the ecosystem?
* you use social media to shape your opinion on the matter?
* you use social media to follow what's the most popular among the users? 
There are many options. Pros and cons already provided in some other comments. In my opinion some of these are very reasonable and some of these make you very vulnerable to influences that you may not even be aware of.

Sure, but for now it's pretty clear to me that the core is the software. It may seem unlikely, but it could happen that the core team splits. We have competent developers on both sides. They both do hard fork at block X but with different rules. Because of some huge disagreement. 
Now of course depending on the software you run it will only accept blocks that it perceives as valid. But how would you choose which one is the Bitcoin now? I presume you are not going to count nodes. You may go with the personal web of trust and call your camp the Bitcoin. But there won't be two equally secure chains on the long run. That's unstable and unlikely situation. One of them will win. And it will be the one with the most work, don't you agree? As mentioned, many forces may play in the meantime, price moving miners from one to the other, but the ultimate consensus still seems to be the chain with the most work done.

Then B2X would become the most secure chain. But it is self balancing. Users are not completely without a vote. The assumption of Bitcoin is that miners optimize for their profits. It's a reasonable assumption. Some big holders may decide B2X is not what they want Bitcoin to be. They sell B2X for BTC. Price of B2X goes down. Miners switch to the more profitable chain.
Of course we may end up in some uncomfortable local maximum. Distributed systems that evolve  don't just take the shortest path to the global maximum. They will go in some wrong direction if locally it seems better. But on the long run, it sorts itself out. Or Bitcoin dies. It cannot be dependent on politics and good will of a bunch of people to exist. 
I know it always all drops down to people. But the consensus is the crucial part. Genius of Bitcoin is that consensus is automated, based on the hashing power.
Let's say the evil wins. Jihan gets the monopoly, he rules Bitcoin. He will try to squeeze more and more from Bitcoin, optimizing for his profits. At some point these profits are big enough that cannot be ignored by others with money. Those invest and by being smarter and more efficient beat him in the hashing game. We still have bloated blockchain. It sucks. But it won't on the long run. 
And once again, we can force and skip this local maximum. Fine. But it is a risky move, and something we must not depend on. Nodes count does not matter. It's irrelevant number that's easy to manipulate. What you hear on reddit is also cheap to manipulate by those with money. Users opinion is based on media. Corporate decisions are forced by users. 
Money is power. It's fine. It's just better if it's there in the open - most money, most hashing power = power. Instead of some games behind the curtains where users are fooled into believing that they are in control. Just like in most democracies.
Web of trust. The consensus rules. Thinking for yourself.

May I ask why? What's stopping you from buying BTC? Wife? Or od you  not feel confident about handling it? Well not sure you want to answer these, if it's the latter then get yourself a trezor. If you know how to trade stocks you won't have trouble figuring out basic safe Bitcoin usage.

One could be that, if the hashpower difference is big, some bigger miner from the chain with more hashpower could do 50% attack on the chain with less hashpower. Doing undo of 6+ confirmations is pretty disturbing. That alone could be a reason for some to use the more secure chain.
I don't believe we will ever have a stable situation where some Bitcon-X has more hashpower than Bitcoin. Do you? I think it may happen temporarily. But it will sort itself out.

I agree that it seems this is what would happen now. But most users, even the most intelligent, can't understand what core is doing. It's a very domain specific knowledge, problems are hard and it requires a lot of time to grasp. So they cannot directly check if that's what they think is good. That's why I'm afraid that in the future there may be an action like what has happened with r/btc. Somebody invested quite a bit of money in making you guys look bad. Luckily not that many felt for that. But good marketing action wins with technical competence in most cases. And people will always fight for power. So I perceive it as a real danger. 
I would hope that in that case, big holders, which I associate with intelligent and mostly technical people, will vote with their money making the core chain more profitable to mine and thus redirecting miners to make it the most secure. 
Btw, I cannot phantom how the PoW change work at this point. I can imagine it happening if it is planned e.g. 5 years ahead. But as a remedy, it seems insane. Very quick centralization of hashpower seems inevitable. And it seems to me that current biggest miners would be the most likely to win that race, already having nicely setup DCs and ASIC supply chain in place. Yes yes, ASIC resistant, even if the algo would be so complex that the shelf intel CPU would be the best hardware miner, just the cooling, power setup and cash already seems to give current monopolists advantage. And there are also govs.
I'd love to hear how in practice we could change PoW. Currently, after I thought about it some time ago, it is impossible in my mind (without many years ahead notice). Maybe somebody already did some writeup about it.

There was a good point to buy still after the $31 bubble if you understood the technology. It dropped down to ~$4 AFAIR. The prob of survival to price ratio was many many times higher back then than at $0.3.

**^ THIS THING**
This is how decentralization works. If you don't like this place you make your own subreddit and if people find it superior they will move. Clearly there is not enough issues with this one to make people looking for a new one. 
I do not personally know or vouch for mods here, but they were here early enough, investing their time and effort, before Bitcoin was a well known thing. They still are and they do it for free.

When you spend your bitcoins you need to eventually put bitcoins from changes from your different transactions together. This makes it visible that all these previous transactions were made by you. This BIP shows how to minimize this unavoidable deanonimization.

Sorry didn't notice comments.
Validating phone, address, e-mail?
No chance. You only can validate phone and e-mail and these can be generated cheaply.
You could only verify hashing power (which is already happening by miners voting) and stake which is harder because big bitcoin owners will not want to touch their bitcoins for this, + potentially it would give power of voting to big merchants and exchanges (well this actually is what you want).
But all in all, BIPs should be accepted by Bitcoin developers. Merchants, users and miners don't really have much clue.  (aka democratic voting for ship direction vs the captain)
So I definitely don't like the committee part. Some formalization of the process could be good though.

There is a difference. They pay for these transactions. So it's more like buying 100 train tickets which makes many other people unable to chose that route. Only that this system is designed to adjust tickets price automatically, and we learn how to do it better with every 'attack'. In case Bitcoin is successful, we will be under 'attack' and attacks all the time.

It's hard to spread lies about future because nobody knows it. 
Bitcoin can exist with or without block size increase. It will look slightly different but the storage of value part is not going to be touched unless people start losing faith in it. 
But I didn't mean to start the debate all over again. 
I think it's not hard to agree, that both sides paint future in black in the case where their vision does not succeed.

If as they say this thing is targetted at developers, early developers, then it should be part of the investment and priced not much higher than the production cost.
Then when a bunch of geeks gets interested, it will find interesting uses and they can monetize on consumer products. I don't understand why average Joe would want to have this thing at the moment (the idea is awesome, but it's useless for normal user at this time).

Can't find the source ([here]( something relevant but not what I was looking for), but 1MB was just a temporary limit as a quick fix for spam attacks.
I agree that incentives design comes from Satoshi, but without those few people that got interested and kept developing it over the years, we would just have some interesting post on a mailing group instead of Bitcoin.
Comment I was replying to was something along the lines of developers being just kids who got lucky who haven't got a clue about economy. 
I suspect you know that since you are talking about incentives which are not mentioned here outside the deleted comment :]
I'm afraid though that economy professor can help very little with block size debate. And I think incentives don't really change with block size (miners still only include tx that are worth it for them), there can be less big fees transactions or many with small fees. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:24:00
Small blocks - higher fees, less transactions, big blocks - lower fees but many transactions. I think it's not obvious in which case profit from fees is higher (but I would bet on the latter)

Depends if you want to own BTC or GBTC. It's paper gold - it has its advantages, but it's not gold.
@_date: 2015-09-04 10:28:31
Just like you I'm here for some time (2010), I'm in favor of block size increase, but I'm not sure why you see lack of it as a failure (in the near future that is, pretty much everybody agrees that on the long run it should be increased).
In case it's not increased Bitcoin will still have it's most important part to me - value of storage. Most payments will happen then on abstraction layers on top - centralized, because centralized is cheaper than decentralized. But that doesn't mean it's bad. You only store amount of money in these systems that you would have in your pocket wallet. And Bitcoin doesn't become dependent on any of them. At any point new ones can evolve  and they will still use the same value that you store in your bitcoins currently.

That's a bad way of doing it. Such message could have been copied from somewhere else.
Always include time and context, unless you want your signed messages to be used against you. E.g. of a good message "I'm Mark Karpeles and I'm doing reddit AMA 2018-04-04 [url]". Actually the "I am Mark" part is irrelevant since you are verifying it against his key anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:15:16
It's a very inconvenient truth, but it really kinda does. We need more big miners. 
It does, because this is the power of Bitcoin that makes it apolitical. You end up with complex politics and authorities unless you acknowledge that Bitcoin is the chain with the most work done. I hate that fact given the current hashing power distribution, but it is a fact.

Two questions.
 Currently miners seem to be voting for this BIP only using coinbase, to actually support it they will have to set block version to 4 (ignoring versionBits), correct?
 &gt; 75% rule: If 9,000 of the last 12,000 blocks are version 4 or greater, reject invalid version 4 blocks. (testnet4: 501 of last 1000)
What situation can create a block that would be invalid version 4 block while being valid version 3 block?

Well, from my, another bitcoin owner, point of view - that would be wonderful ;) (nobody has the private key, so these coins are lost, so all other bitcoins are worth a bit more now).

So hey trezor, if you want to make some money, this is pretty much the last chance to lower the price.
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:17:33
There is a test value in that.
You provide somebody an address where you want to receive a lot of money. (or you are sending it yourself from another place). You do that to make sure address wasn't spoofed on it's way there or that there was no typo. You see that the money landed where it should have. I agree that it's not the most pro way, doesn't guarantee anything either, but it works.
@_date: 2015-11-02 06:10:33
Sure, but I linked to specific currency, because only in specific currency you can see volume in that currency (you can select that under the chart then). 
In your link this is again BTC volume (so in terms of fiat it looks like there was more volume in places where the price was lower)

Nah, there are quite a few more of you who haven't thought this through. 
Maybe another one of them is reading so..
 
1. You need exchanges to be able to change your fiat to bitcoin. These exchanges need to store btc securely anyway if they are to be realtime exchanges, so you kinda get bitcoin storage accidentally.
2. They help adoption tremendously. There are many users who don't need to store millions in bitcoin and those are the most handy ways of handling bitcoins for them.
3. It's very different from normal banks. Apart from lending and creating money out of thin air part, nobody is going to bail them out. Nobody forces anybody to use them. Bad ones will die and the best ones will live.
So by all means, boycott. If you don't like these things, don't use them. That's the beauty of Bitcoin. We only have to agree on the longest chain.

I don't remember which was the most popular slack, but on IRC connect to freenode and check  or  if you have more advanced technical questions.
If you want to create an altcoin, well I wouldn't recommend it if you don't fully grasp Bitcoin, it will inevitably be insecure, but google altcoin generator and you'll find some tools.
[Bitcoin wiki]( is probably the best knowledge source, [developer guide]( also has some good parts.
Well, I guess I wont try to discourage you from creating an altcoin. Sooner or later you'll realize that it was not a great idea. but hopefully by that time you'll have deeper technical understanding of Bitcoin. And the more people do, the better.

Not saying your situation isn't serious though, just had a chuckle. So you say "they are claiming my account is compromised", what was you deposit address?

Are you sure the deposit address that they displayed got funds? Can you share the address? It seems hard to believe they would try to scam somebody in such a silly way.
Btw, random idea for sites like these and maybe exchanges. Sign deposit addresses with your PGP key. Then customer can be sure they sent it to the right one, and also in cases like these customer can prove funds got there.

So instead of questions you could have randomly generated paper wallet. And all you would have to remember is a passphrase. 
You can manage to remember a single strong passphrase. You can built it in your head however you like. And stealing the paper still won't be enough. 
Such solution seems incomparably more secure than yours to me.

I've been their user for a while, giving out tips happily, but I'm ready to quit if that's true. 
They got their initial hype within bitcoin community, pushing out competitor that was popular back then (forgot the name) with their heavy marketing.

Because it was hegding. You buy Berskshire and then create such bet with appropriate amount. The bet is not symetric - it's in BTC so if BTC is worth less you lose less, if BTC is worth more you win more.

Yeah, but they got this 20 years from their paper provider. They really don't know if it will last that long. I saw some big companies not saving a cent on these papers (to make them last long) and those were still pretty blank after 8 years. Nobody cares much because normally information on these isn't worth as much as paper wallet can be.
Besides, when using paper instead of some digital media, why would you limit yourself to even just 20 years? Even the worst kind of papers covered with ink, they may be falling apart after 100 years, but they are still readable.

You only need to do a -rescan. Depending on your hardware it will probably take a few hours. Nothing needs to be downloaded for that.
Txindex (unrelated to your problem) would somewhat increase your storage and slightly slow down your node. Unless you know that you need it, you probably don't.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:18:50
Yes they can. 
It wouldn't really do that much because many nodes use dns discovery and already have list of known nodes, but regarding node stats it has a big influence. That's why node count based stats are utterly useless and damaging.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:17:15
Contrary to what reddit screams, they are. It's just that their earnings go up when Bitcoin value goes up so it's in their interest to optimise for bright Bitcoin future, but it looks like there's some loophole. It would sort itself out on the long run but people want to fix it sooner because it's possible.
Be warned though, that buying twitter tags and reddit posts is much much cheaper than getting enough hashing power. So while this rush may be legitimate, it opens up a door for goverments and some Mallorys to control Bitcoin without owning 50%+ hashing power. 
It's extremely important in systems where you care about security, to know what it is based on. Assumptions on which it all stands. In bitcoin it is hashing power. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:11:56
What were the arguments against it in the past? It seems pretty cool.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:30:53
Not the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:52:17
Because if it's say only 10%, then e.g. somebody associated with the exchange, or just somebody who cares less about their bitcoins security, can put 100%, and then you have votes ratio 10:1
In theory risk is the same, but there also can be bias. E.g. people who see bitcoin as value of storage rather than payment system are probably more likely to have it buried in some cold storage and less willing to put it on the exchange.
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:33:27

I have mixed feelings. It's very cool and useful, but in many cases this website won't get a visit that it would get otherwise.

Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system, 2008 S Nakamoto 


Of course. But who decides which block is valid? Twitter comitee? It is decided mostly by the reference client, but miners must decide they want to run it. It is their incentive that keeps Bitcoin safe. If  the reference client goes nuts for some reason, e.g. 21million is removed (yeah, I know), miners won't just run it.
P2SH if you have been around was quite a different story. It was pretty controversial at that time too but Gavin said we run that and well, we did. 
Single person leadership has its advantages, but a truly robust and decentralized system cannot afford that SPoF.
If I need to convince you what miner who owns 50%+ hashing power can do then this discussion level gets pretty low. But here, say 40% is mining the chain that you like, and 60% the chain that you don't like. You say you just don't care about this 60% chain. But at any point they can revert transactions on 40% chain.
And to be super clear, I'm not trying to defend any current miner. But it's crucial to remember how Bitcoin works and what PoW was invented for. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:09:26
it doesn't have to be this way now that we got down to a few nanometers, it all slows down a lot. You can see that there's not uch progress in CPUs in the last few years. Which means that the hardware has more time to pay back for itself. And the cost of mining drops down to electricity + maintanance and handling excessive heat.  It's hard to do a profitab0le mining operation, because bigger mining farm can be more efficient. A single miner however, is a different story. You home heater in the winter, water heater, a kettle, an oven they all gcan use heat from mining asics instead of resistive wire. that is realistic because once designed, the chips themselves are really cheap. 
If the trend of CPUs coming with FPGAs holds, that could also help.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:56:16
Oh, I missed that, sorry. I saw the address at the bottom so I assumed that's it. I admit, pretty clever. 
I don't support it, but I do believe miners behavior should be incentive driven. 
As long as miners are well educated and rational actors, all holders are safe, because miners will optimize for the highest Bitcoin value.

@_date: 2015-10-18 20:27:38
Well I guess earning less than you could have can be called losing money.
More outputs is fine, as long as the total amount of BTC is OK. E.g. I send 1BTC to your address and then you send it to 5 different addresses (say each one 0.2BTC) within a single transaction - 5 outputs, 1 input, no double spend, just a typical transaction. 
Double spend would be if you would create another transaction that is spending the same input (trying to send this 1BTC to two different places at once)

When you send a transaction it has input and outputs. Inputs are where coins are coming from, outputs are where they are going to.
If sum of outputs is greater than sum of inputs, transactions is invalid.
If sum of outputs is less than sum of inputs, then the remaining amount of BTC can be collected by  a miner as a transaction fee.
But it doesn't have to be. And if it's not, these coins are lost forever.
(e.g. if you just mined a block and included a transaction with the fee 0.01, your coinbase transaction can spend 25.01BTC)
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:38:29

Government is not a single person that rationally decides things. It's a huge bunch of people connected by inefficient communication channels and slowed down by tons of bureaucracy. The world outside which consists of many more people is changing faster than they can follow. And presumably, from vast amount of things that need attention, they focus on the most currently pressing matters. Bitcoin market cap is still pocket change compared to the Wall Street.
That said, back in the early days, the thing that stopped me from investing heavily in Bitcoin after understanding the underlying technology, was the fact that I was convinced that as soon as governments learn about it, they will deem it illegal.
Why some other crypto won't replace Bitcoin? Because we need safe digital storage of value. I can't imagine the future without it. If Bitcoin would ever be replaced by X, then you can't feel safe storing your value in X, because at any point it can be replaced by Y. But will it be Y1 or Y2? But we can keep storage of value while pretty much replacing the technology thanks to crypto magic like sidechains.

EV - expected value (expected payout in this case)
When you are mining, somebody may already have found a block, but you may not realize it. If you find a block then, it will become an orphan (everybody already accepted this other one as the longest chain). 
Mining pools don't have "stornger influence on the blockchain" but they are doing their best to minimize this orphan rate which you may not be able to do just as well. 
Yes there is a very slim chance that you find a block but ignoring the mentioned issue on the long run theoretically you should collect more money than if you take part in pooled mining (although as we all know, variance is a bitch)

1. put 10% in btc if you feel like playing (since it will take you long time to understand the technology)
2. put most of it in gold, and store it safely, it's still maybe the safest storage of value especially if you have some land to hide it 
3. don't listen to random guys from reddit like myself

I do not recommend laptop because they usually have some wireless connections built in. 
Some may be, personally I prefer older hardware for this reason, but there's still BIOS. And it's really hard to be sure of anything unless you built that hardware, so if you want to be on the safe side, just don't let it even connect to the internet after it's seen the private key. Then even if there's a malware, it cannot do anything meaningful with your coins (well it could alter the transaction that you are signing there, but that's easy enough to check). 
Should be obvious, but just in case for those reading - you don't take this signed transaction on a usb stick, photo + ocr/QR or just type it in, it may be worth it. 
TLDR trezor is easy and safe

This number is meaningless. Single person can generate it by sending money back and forth (for completely free if they are a miner, and pretty cheap if the amount is high enough).

@_date: 2015-03-08 22:26:07
As you mentioned, it is crucial that it is a hash separate from the crypto used for signing. This way if you don't reuse addresses even if ECDSA would get totally owned (unlikely), we can still recover. Without this, if ECDSA is broken, that would be the end of Bitcoin, because nobody is able to prove that given bitcoins belong to him.

There is no ASIC resistant mining PoW. No matter how many random computations you stick in there, it will still be more efficient to have ASIC doing this rather than general CPU that also have to do context switching, talking with IO, optimize for some common desktop usage patterns and so on. This ASIC would be much more costly to design, but even at the current stage of Bitcoin it would likely be already profitable.
No matter what PoW is, it's still an algorithm. Algorithm that you have to be able to implement, it's harder doing it with logic  gates, but far from impossible.

For the 382495th time, centralized or partially centralized systems are more efficient than those fully decentralized.

How is this going to work as an incentive? if they don't have majority of the hashrate they can't take it anyway since the block won't be accepted by the rest of the network. If it gets accepted then at this point incentive wasn't necessary.

Security is hard indeed.
Hardware wallet like trezor will let you be sure you are signing the transaction you want. You could probably check if the deposit address is correct from another computer like your smartphone.
When your computer is compromised then then if the attacker is clever enough he is able to steal coins from the exchange you are using through this computer (not trivial, not really likely in automated fashion so you'd have to be targeted). When the funds are on your hardware wallet then they are safe even if your computer is compromised. 
But really, if you're dealing with this kind of money, apart from trezor, buy yourself a laptop (like an old thinkpad with the ibm logo), do a fresh ubuntu install which is trivial and then do what you were about to do.

I see you removed your post, I don't know why. I think I can see your point, and incentives currently are indeed not perfect. E.g. if distribution would be pretty flat, instead of naturally occurring power law distribution, there's little incentive for any small owner to invest his time in trying to improve Bitcoin when the profits will be distributed equally among all owners. 
Anyway, this kind of discussion full of nuances is nice to have with a fellow bitcoiner over a beer or a coffee. It practically never works out on reddit. 
I like this kind of posts with insights even if I don't agree with them. Please don't remove them next time even if you get downvoted. Hive mind tend to make the most noise but it can be filtered out.

On my CC, which can be also used to pay online, they also put a CVV code (!!!) because why not.
To those saying Visa will giye your money back. You should better read the terms.  If transaction is authorized by the pin, your are at fault.
And not only the fact that pin is only 4 digits long and easy to get, the way terminals check it is also a mess if you tinker just a bit.
Long story short, there's a lot of info on the internet, and CC security is absolutely terrible. What saves them is most of these problems are really small amounts, and they can cover it even if they don't have to, according to the terms, and the fact that the fees are super high just hidden from customers in various ways including paybacks.

Come on people, basics. How hard it is to understand. Bitcoin was invented because you can't trust anonymous peers on the internet for consensus.

Node count is irrelevant.

Let's make one thing clear. Some things can be improved, but the growth of adoption that companies like coinbase provide is one of the most valuable things in our ecosystem. 
Ideological motivation is one thing, but we won't have a working global currency with Amir shouting out his ideas and assumptions that crypto is not that hard and people should just learn it.
Most people are not ready to be unplugged.. (...) They need some way to start with bitcoins within the current legal system that we have. You can't change the world in one day, so it seems reasonable to choose easiest paths that still push us forward.

Sounds weird. I mean users with authy have to switch 2FA somehow. So I'm assuming you are not receiving any SMS messages? Would be really weird if you are in the US. In case of lost 2FA (not your fault here) waiting it out is usually a good idea security-wise. But if you are trying to log in with the same IP that you used to log in they should let you in. I know little about authy but they should have logs which messages were delivered because most operators make this information available. So yeah if that's the case seems they screwed up to handle it properly. Should just call you on this number and try to ask some verification questions if you went through it, they could ask for sending $1.34 from a bank account in your name and so on.

If you want to give up your current job, just do it. Life is too short not to be doing something you like. No excuses. It's really possible nowadays if you really try. You can't always get what you want, but if you really want to do something, you can do it, even if it means changing your lifestyle or moving to a  different place.
And if you like what you're doing, why would you stop even if you don't need to do it for money.

I'm not able to open the podcast now to find exact quotes, but the whole thing about spitted chain coexisting seemed full of misunderstandigs. provides some good points in another comment, but think I even have heard something like - one chain is less secure SPV clients handling small transactions - I don't want to misquote without listening. but SPV clients has little to do with the chain itself and if one chain has more hashing power, then it can sabotage the chain with less hashing power. Trying to reformulate what AA said also can lead to some problems because some words are carefully chosen and important for a curious listener (again, can't listen right now but e.g. longest chain vs most work chain).  It would be really really messy and Bitcoin would potentially lose some of the value of storage property in case of the split. But as long as people are optimizing for profit no such thing is going to happen. It's a bit [like this]( except they go the same way afterwards.
Also, my comment might have came out as more offensive than  I planned I guess. I meant it as a constructive criticism. I'm really happy we have these podcasts.

Get over it. If you want to store funds online or use online exchanges *they will* ask you where did you get your funds from, and what are you going to do with them. Especially when you go past some thresholds. It's KYC/AML and it's ridiculous. But you will get the same thing in any exchange that follows US law.

It's a tautology. Bitcoin is a currency. So the only way it can have value is as a currency. 
But the value of a currency depends on many factors - trust, scarcity, divisibility, being hard to forge etc. Gold could be an example. Widespread usage is part of the value, no doubt about it. But you can use it using tools that make it more handy/efficient. In all that I'm describing here, there are still bitcoins underneath.

Awesome collection. Much jelly.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:26:07
It was true in 2010/2011. It was binary. We didn't know if there will be some major flow or if governments would ban it right away. They didn't. We have regulations. And Bitcoin is worth a lot. 
It's worth remembering it wasn't easy putting money in Bitcoin when it was at $0.2. There was never anything like this so the scenario when it goes close to zero and gets forgotten for various reasons seemed very likely.
On the long run it still holds true. As long as Bitcoin exists it will keep gaining value. Because that's how it's designed. And being the first crypto it's the only option as a safe storage of value. If the storage of value moved elsewhere then it could move again. So there would never be a safe storage of value in crypto. But I think there will be.
There's no scenario when Bitcoin goes to price X and then oscillates around it. People imagine it this way because that's how assets they know work. Not many realize how different Bitcoin is from anything that we ever had in the history of mankind.

Personally I would leave speculation and gambling outside of the charity scope. Accepting bitcoins is a good idea because there are some people who will only donate with bitcoins, and it's usually simpler than by any other means. Preferably this charity should be able to do its stuff (say buy food for homeless) directly with bitcoin, but until that's possible it seems natural to exchange to dollars in order to buy what money was donated for.
With mining I'll make it simple for you. Calculate how many bitcoins you spend on the equipment, and calculate how many bitcoins you get back within a year or two (assuming continued difficulty increase and no hardware problems)

Chinese gov can have a huge influence on Bitcoin currently. It should get better as more mining ASICs companies appear (which should be I hope within 2 years). 
But I think most miners realize where the Bitcoin value comes from. They care about that value. So it's likely that in the case of too strong gov regulations they would just move their farms elsewhere (even if all miners would be confiscated, still the IP and masks are the key)

We do need abstraction layers on top to help merchants. The thing is, there is a free open market for them and hopefully they will be working well and cheap.


Another thing that is yet not wide adoption ready. Most non technical people need some idiot-proof hardware devices to handle their bitcoins. These are already developed but it's going way to slow.


Other comments, yeah we want to pay taxes.


Well cold storage is a cost of a sheet of paper with no maintenance cost attached to it. Could be worse.

The thing is, there is a difference between mining at home and mining where you focus on it and have a good setup. Good setup may include so called free electricity.
