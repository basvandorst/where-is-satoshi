For the next time someone tell you how much energy is "wasted" with bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:40:28
2 guys at work (I send them to CB few months ago) and a new guy asked my how to buy and I send him directly to gemini or bittrex.
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:04:45
I thought only bitcoin was dangerous ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:13:07
"can't wait until you have a competitor" ? seriously ?
try gemini or bittrex....
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:30:22
2032..... bitcoin is dead since a long time...like humanity ;) who only live in the memory of a super IA which almost finish exploring all planets of our solar system.

Nice. Where is he living BTW ? Always a smart idea to post such findings on reddit...
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:04:58
it is very reliable. Just lack of token. I use bittrex too
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:02:42
Just after "porn" i guess ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:40:59
bittrex too. They no longer accept new customer due to the huge number of registration today ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:04:20
at work people ask me about bitcoin.....usually i send them to coinbase. Now i move to bittrex and will send them to bittrex too (I also like gemini a lot)
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:38:51
usual next move : the GOV ban gold in such case (look for USA gold ban)
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:29:52

This is: 
"penalty of $10,000 and/or up to five to ten years imprisonment"

@_date: 2018-05-23 11:53:38
it seems they already took back some last year but now they are taking everything back so i don t think this article is so old.

The repatriation wave began in 2012, when Venezuela announced it was withdrawing all of its 160 tons of gold at the NY Fed, valued at around $9 billion.... Let s hope it will works better for turkey

"The Fed under new leadership on Wednesday unveiled proposed changes to the Volcker Rule, which bars banks' risky trading bets for their own profit with depositors' money. The high-risk activity is known as proprietary trading."

good luck for the taxes !
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:55:04
Yep i m waiting for it to invest more hoping it is a big one like 2008 follow by a 10 year bull ;)
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:58:28
i m not acting like genius i m trying to explain that storing your wealth in crypto may not be the best choice versus stocks (maybe in a 401k)
@_date: 2019-03-28 21:00:42
MMT  or QE forever ;)
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:57:37
SPY is one of the most safe... my point is that indeed the US debt growth but if your goal is to preserve your wealth the stocks market may be better than crypto. if you want crazy stck trading with 80% a day just go in ;)
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:22:30
that was a big fear in 2008 when the gov start QE  [  " If central banks increase the money supply, it can cause [inflation]( " but we are now in 2019 and this inflation did not happen (some ppl say it may happen with a delay) and that is also a big fear in 2019 when ppl speak about MMT  [  but nobody realy know
@_date: 2019-03-28 21:00:08
Thx you ! so many ppl get tricked by these various "guy gold and silver" youtube preachers....also regarding the US household debt (not talking about GOV one) the level of debt in indeed increasing but the revenue are still bigger than the debt. For real figures to understand the impact look at the proportion of debt compare to income like here [ and then you understand that ppl accumulate more debt but in the meantime they also get more revenue so the %debt is in fact decreasing.... seems US citizens are not so stupid in fact....﻿for the ppl more interested &gt;&gt; [
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:26:33
it s not that great but it save you from inflation. Buying SPY will certainly not make you rich since it is a very safe TRACKER and my point is not to be rich....it s just that there are proven method to protect you from inflation. Regarding the debt the gov can just print money to pay it.... They done it in 2008 to save the stocks market with QE  [  and now in 2019 ppl talk about MMT with same logic  [ 
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:22:38

@_date: 2018-10-14 22:10:14
i wonder if they had the same meme in 1932 before [
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:09:33
what ?? similar to BTC ? "give the Swiss National Bank the sole authority to create money" It is a centralize system where you trust the national bank only. It is not like BTC. Also I would not trust any central banks these days when you see the deficit of all countries (and just look at US printing money without end)
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:45:58
This remind me this news from few days back  [  Are we gonna see a ban of address or coin related to certains address ?
@_date: 2019-10-11 18:02:38
Nobody mentioned the IMF paper to kill cash and enforce deep negative rate  [
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:33:19
lol. Seriously ?? You should stop just reading headlines. Ant has indeed raise 14 B but they never said they will use that for blockchain "step up the development of new technologies and its global expansion." from (
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:12:00
lol. Now the idea is out there.....you are funny. This idea is out there for a long time my friend and the reality is that this support for the idea is dropping more every day (the number of people in favor of this idea drop from 46% beg of 2017 to 24% today).
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:04:34
I don t know how my microwave works but still use it daily. I don t know how internet encrypt my info when I log on my bank online but still use it...
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:01:54
I think it would be hard to do a biggest mistake that the first one....
@_date: 2019-04-01 22:47:52
like all pyramid scam.....it s very good if you are in the first "investor" and exit before the scam is revealed. Some ppl made ton shit of money with Madoff ;)
@_date: 2019-04-22 13:31:37
Noticed that too. I got an extra "credit card" fee the other day when paying a bill online.
@_date: 2019-04-22 14:15:54
bank transfer was free of charge but i don t like letting other company initiate a bank transfer from my account (which if you think of it is crazy dangerous)
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:34:38
Can t wait to "paint" my wall with dollars.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:05:44
no. in the US they can initiate it. you enter your bank info and they will initiate the transfer for you. It sounds crazy especially when you compare that to the level of security of crypto ;)
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:20:12
bitcoin is only mentioned in the title then 1/3 of article is about the "Petro Cryptocurrency"... my 2 cents....they are trying to pump this gov crypto....nothing related to BTC here
@_date: 2018-11-04 14:13:25
let me rephrase it.... Student make 400k$ after tax trading shitcoins
@_date: 2018-11-12 13:10:17
so, did anyone manage to solve the issue ? I m curious ;)
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:07:09
That is what buffet suggest to do with BTC. Buy one and forget about it
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:02:06
I have to come clean guys....Maybe had been me. I move my 0.00000001 BTC the same day so..... sorry :(
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:45:54
Yes but the petro is the gov crypto so if the gov say that the only legal crypto is the petro you have no choice but have to use it.
@_date: 2018-11-09 01:11:11
lot of comment about the source so here we go with another one: [ \&gt;&gt; " The Bank has refused to release the gold bars, worth about £420 million,  according to sources. British officials are understood to have insisted  that standard measures to prevent money-laundering be taken — including  clarification of the Venezuelan government’s intentions for the gold. "
@_date: 2018-11-13 02:41:34
would feel safer with gold
@_date: 2019-01-02 12:15:20
You re right. ICO are but not BTC/ETH [ and [ so it should be OK

Thx for the second links. Much more info that the original one. It's indeed good if they manage to accept non-gov crypto and i hope they will not have issue in the future.

I wonder if there were doing meme in 1936 before gov ban gold. Source: 
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:26:16
not really :( At least not this time....
" it’s essentially the same $75 billion that gets recycled every day "  [ 
and it s not a QE because they did not create new money but just used their actual reserve....
but I agree on the general idea that they devaluate the currency with their QEs but not this time.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:10:01
your story (particularly "noticed something else was needed. Because lots of refugees are stuck in camps, without an opportunity for them to get back on their own feet in this new country") remind me a startup i saw in Mass challenge recnetly
