The next 24 hours are important but the bonus cheques thing is bogus... Wallstreet guys don't need to wait for bonus cheques to invest in crypto.
 It is still to be seen if there is any correlation between reading crypto charts and stock charts, but the current chart has consolidated nicely and is poised to breakout (theoretically) 
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:27:09
Ok, that makes sense. Should people have any concerns about ordering them other than the lack of performance? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:24:00
Interesting... So these are just S9 rejects? They claim they are "reliable" is that just a sales tactic or is that due to some other reason?

@_date: 2019-07-04 06:17:43
It only took me one year of crypto obsession to understand that Bitcoin is basically the only real deal. 
I admittedly still hold some Litecoin but everything else is just people chasing lottery money. I’m bummed I learned the hard way but I’m glad I learned from it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:18:15

Take the word “like” out of your comment.
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:19:23
Think if you had a printing press that could print fiat money to go put into bitcoin ATMS and buy Bitcoin. Then you could turn around and sell them to somebody for “real” fiat money. 
The same amount of Bitcoin exists but it’s a dangerous game where somebody is manipulating the market and that devalues the whole market as long as people have the ability to print and use fake money, ie Tether.

A use case and monetary value are not always linked. Some of my favorite projects will never be high value. I even mine them simply to support the project.

I am mining in Kano pool currently and am very happy with it. The whole thing has been easy, exciting and profitable. No regrets.

Wait... are people actually worried about this? I thought we were just joking.
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:30:56

Watch volume. I mean that it’s not manipulated price.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:47:53
Well setup was really easy and they are making pretty good profit, my only frustration is that when I bought these, the coin was less than half of what it is now so it’s hard wishing I would have just bought bitcoin or litecoin directly.                                                                 
I built a small cleanroom and wired 4 separate outlets into it (240V each) and then I wired a pigtail and plug the whole unit directly into my 50A welding plug out in my shop. It’s working pretty well. Keeps my shop a little warmer in winter also! If anyone has any specific questions, I will answer anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:08:55
Thanks, they were actually really easy to set up and have been killing it with this huge price increase. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:19:46
yea, I just checked again. Mine is completely blank... Im not sure.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:33:01
Actually... I think you just leave the password blank completely now that I think of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:06:38
Yea, they are definitely noisy. The payouts will continue to rise as you contribute. Keep in mind that Kano pool only pays out when it clears a block which can sometimes take days or weeks. But the payouts are much higher than in the bigger pools. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:31:48
Im averaging closer to $50/day but you must keep in mind that I am not selling so as the price has jumped, my average has jumped also. For the password just put an X. its a dumb field that they should get rid of. why would you need a password for your address? its not like somebody else is going to mine for you... and if they did I sure don't want to stop them!

@_date: 2018-08-27 04:08:37
You are thinking of OVER clocking. Im talking about UNDER clocking. It makes them run cooler and more efficient.

@_date: 2018-08-27 01:41:06
I have a lot of S9’s and actually found that I could make them more efficient by under clocking them which makes them more profitable even though the hashrates are lower.

I need a complicated program to manage logistics for my trucking company. I need it to not only dispatch efficient routes to my drivers but also need a mobile app for all my drivers to get their BOL’s (Bill of Lading) signed. 
If we could build a BOL system on the blockchain with smart contracts to facilitate payment this would be my dream. I would prefer a merge mined blockchain for security. Maybe NameCoin...
I can pay in BTC, LTC, FLO or with a check like a caveman.

You are assuming the values go in the direction you want in the time you want. What if you transfer your BTC&gt;LTC then the Litecoin sinks while bitcoin goes up.

any reason for that wallet specifically? 
also, are the online profit calculators accurate? if so, why aren't people just buying these things up like crazy? with 14 TH/s and only 1300W consumption, power cost isn't even that big of a deal... really seems too good to be true.

Ok, great. This is the kind of info I'm looking for. The pool thing kind of confuses me. So the pools make different amounts of money? how many miners would you need to be your own pool?
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:29:27
I'm not the right guy to explain this fully, but the short answer is that it doesn't. It refers to the difficulty of mining which correlates to profitability of mining which doesn't directly effect the value of the coin. This is my understanding. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:40:59
is "slush" pool a specific pool or are you just saying to mine as part of a pool?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:09:55
Actually as of right now, Mining BTC will get 30% easier in 13 days. 
you can track that here:

Well, I like the first 75% of your sentences... 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:20:43
Why? do you think I will lose money on them? I tried like 10 different profit calculators and they all came out in the positive. Most of them gave me a ROI of under a year, seems like a solid investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:28:40
So this is a little confusing to me also. Why does the return decline so quickly? Is it just the difficulty increase? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:47:01
Actually as of right now, Difficulty is set to get 25% easier. you can keep an eye on it here: 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:37:01
naw, electricity at .065/Kwh 
All the calculators look great. Even the conservative ones. That was part of the drunken research.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:17:18
Thanks for the good advice. I actually have no concern on the setup. I work in a similar sector, I am just new to the bitcoin idea and was a little confused by the pool system and the increasing difficulty etc... I have done a ton of research since and I feel pretty good about it. I probably should have started with 1 but running 4 looked much better on the calculators. Ill be running 54 TH/s with cheap electricity in a shop that will sit around 40 degrees until next spring... hopefully I can make some coin. Ill try to update. Thanks again.

@_date: 2019-04-26 16:55:52
If this is real, you could start by looking at every transaction that year (volume was still low) and hopefully there is only 1 for that exact amount. Even easier if you know the day or month this occurred in. 
At the very least you would then have a wallet address and be able to check if it still contained the BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:00:38
You guys need to look at the S9. I think it’s much more efficient than you are considering. The first one arrives in a couple days, I’ll let you guys know if it’s profitable. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:46:39
I must agree. I jumped around for a while but Kano.is is the best. you have to be patient as blocks are more rare but it usually beats most pools for earnings. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:00:08
I’ll have to check it out.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:04:47
Yea, I hate Bitmain there’s just no way they are running a S11 already... 
unless the S11 is only slightly better than the S9. There is also huge value in being first to market, so if they had something better they would at least put some for sale.

That’s exactly what me and a majority of our circle of friends did. You have to realize only a couple guys did this and some of the guys in our group have been in since 2010 so they feel pretty strongly about Bitcoin. I would have never done it, but it’s their money I guess... 
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:08:12
The said, and I quote “it’s a matter of principal” I’m talking about over 100 coins by one of these guys. I don’t agree but it shows how strongly they feel.

I actually agree with you, I just think the tax system has lost its way. Too many loop holes and needs complete overhaul. Need a flat tax in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:26:00
I guess maybe we work/Live in different cross-sections of the world. I literally talked to a guy at work that was saving so he could “buy a bitcoin” he didn’t believe me when I explained he could buy $10 of bitcoin. (Real literally, not white girl literally)  
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:05:35
Nope. Doesn’t matter how much you have. Only matters how much you spend on goods.
