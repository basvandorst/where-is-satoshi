What if I told you that Bitcoin was an idea of the elites and wall street which was purposefully introduced right after the 2008 crash (not a coincidence) in order to plant this new  seed of a concept, only gaining traction with years as bankers accumulated. I believe this game has been rigged from the very start.

What? You make no sense whatsoever. Following my advice at least you dollar cost average because you took the chance when the price kept going low and bought. Everyone is expecting bitcoin to drop below 6k and for that reason it just won't happen but good luck to you and your great strategy of buying as the price recovers.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:29:06
You make the assumption that btc will drop that low. Do not say things based on nothing. Following your advice a lot of people will buy back in high.

I don't think whales care about reddit or our lunch money. They just know how to move the market in order to cause as much fear as possible. We are talking about professionals here. You guys should research on quants, it's quiet interesting.

Market definately wears one out
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:33:53
Tax is important, the problem is that its not done fairly. The system is all made in a way that keeps most poor and a few rich.

Your advice is even worse. Buying on the way back up means losing the opportunity when the price was lower. You have to buy the dip.
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:36:12

@_date: 2018-03-03 09:21:53
This "consolidation" is an illusion. Bitcoin market is plagued with trading bots. Just like you, I believed we could crash all the way back to 4k.When we crashed to 6k no one saw it coming, now it could have been too easy to drop the price even further so they (market manipulators) could be waiting it out this time and when we all least expect we may have another correction... who knows.
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:43:55
More like 2 months
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:54:45
Not really, in fact it looks like a bulltrap. We havent even retested 6k yet.
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:46:50
Yep. Cause shorters believed it was going to correct after the runup, since it kept going up shorts dropped immediately.
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:50:13

@_date: 2018-07-12 23:28:11
Man you have to relax. Yes being a bag holder sucks, it will wear anyone down psychologically/emotionally.. but at this point all you can do is wait. This market is heavily manipulated (I am not going to debate this anymore) - Just stop and think about how you are feeling atm, you may want to panic sell now, but that's what "they" want you to do. When you least expect it this market will be driven up. Save my post and come back in a few months time.
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:32:27
Wishful thinking.
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:57:07
They probably lost a lot of money, shit tonnes of it - and now they rejoice in other people's misfortunes. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:32:44
@_date: 2018-07-20 00:57:03
Never again, you will buy back in now or higher, save my post :)

Cryptotwins. Go watch their vids they are funny af.
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:12:09
No, I'm serious. I'm pretty sure all the panic sellers will buy back in very high because of this mindset.

You wouldn't be saying that if you were in the green. Hypocrisy at its finest.

Soon though, this is the calm before the storm.. the one that will wreck the short sellers once again.. you mark it.
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:55:25
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:29:15
Yep but as soon as you talk about Bitcoin going down this always happens, just shows what kind of individuals lurk these subs.
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:47:26
It's FUD init

@_date: 2018-07-23 15:48:32
You will buy back in at 9-10k 
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:02:56
All kindzz......
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:38:26
In 4 months we will be on the moon while you wait for 5k.. 8)
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:34:31
Exactly, you couldn't have said this any better.. there is too much hypocrisy in this world.
@_date: 2018-07-18 05:00:51
Open your short positions ma friends, this thing is about to load ze dip.
Edit: I'm getting downvoted for stating the obvious? This is a huge bulltrap but each to their own.
Edit2: Toxic sub. I get downvoted just because I said we are going down. Ridiculous.

This manipulated crap always begins with a smooth correction, then followed by a huge dump. It has bear trapped  everyone 3 times in a row and the longs shot through the roof. Just you watch... Domp eet again

That bar is not there because a millionth actually do sell when it goes up.

Make no mistake - everyone that bought high has it grim. It will be a chance if this market recovers.
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:57:53
When it does you will FOMO back in, that's when it will drop again.. easy game :)

@_date: 2018-07-12 23:11:48
These kind of comments are an indication that the bottom may be very near. I bet you sell now and the market will go up. Bitcoin and Altcoins are extremely manipulated and can toy with everyone's emotions too easily... don't be fooled.

@_date: 2018-04-28 08:25:15


The part I don't get is the leveraging. Just to follow your example, let's say I borrow 25k USD and open a short when BTC hits the price of 10k USD. With a leverage of 5:1 would't my margin of 10k USD get liquidated *way* before the price of BTC hit 20k USD? The math behind leveraging gets me confused :s
@_date: 2018-07-13 21:13:14
This market will recover and your kind will hide under the rocks once again.
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:52:58
Ok this makes sense, thanks for clarifying. Btw, I didn't know you could short bitcoin with 1x leverage.
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:41:09
There is nothing such as "week" hand when you are about to get liquidated.
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:52:03
Hi guys, a quick question: I was wondering about an aspect of margin trading. I don't know wether this is important but let's say I got 10,000 USD in my margin account. I would like to know what is the difference between opening a short position of 5 BTC volume with 2x leverage and 2BTC volume with 5x leverage, I would have thought that I would get the same gains as long as the price dips right? I just want to confirm wether my knowledge is on point.
