some exchanges have stopped Deposits/Withdrawals.
we are facing this past one month.
This should be treated as FUD

I fellow indian, Indian exchanges like zebpay and unocoin have high buy but also relatively higher sell than foreign exchange counterparts.
I will suggest you to buy from Indian exchanges as it will be less of a hassle.

Expection some at 15k .
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:20:43
And growing.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:08:08
Not much is all I can say buddy. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:26:48
Agree. I have following up with ltc and eth and found this behavior.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:21:22
Actually I was gonna do the exact opposite, sell btc and buy ltc mainly and rest eth
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:21:52
All coins are linearly related to btc.
I believe...
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:28:28
Ltc is new thing, growth rate is better (if not vastly Superior) 
Again I won't say BTC has exhausted it's growth but ltc being new and mostly unnoticed is on a growth which BTC did see years ago when it boomed.

Support no
Recognition double no :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:55:33
yes im using same app (zebpay)
now this app actually has higher buy value than USD counterparts and lesser sell.
so we indians end up paying more, somewhere near 30000INR (450$) for a bitcoin!!! 
Let that sink in..

@_date: 2017-11-29 16:35:26
Fellow indian...which wallet are you using for holding coins?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:36:54
It was possible at great dip which occurred this week.
Never plunged to 11k to make a proper sell
