And you think all the small time investors are dumb or poor enough to not buy shitloads of it at 2k? A king reigns until he's killed or replaced and i see nothing of the two happening anytime soon.

It wont. If people liken bitcoin to gold then you should be prepared to deal with similar shortcomings to gold. Meaning: It's difficult, expensive and takes time to move around but in return you get a product as stable and as resistant as gold. Plus, with all the diversification of money that crypto introduced, im sure in 10-15 years we will have a currency for everything and every need, whether that'd be banking, commerce, anonymity or anything that has big enough use-case to be adopted.

This is exactly a situation where you can find yourself with an extra ps4 and one less roommate.

Im just here to point out that you're comparing a fully developed network that has been in constant use and development for the past few centuries with one that was conceived a decade ago.
Cpt.Obvious, out!

Simply because this one is tuned in a way that favors the circuit. Im insulted and i feel that my work's not respected when i bust my ass all day to sustain a business only to pay half of my income in taxes for theoretical funds that were spent on bail-out moves for our banks.
Then, there's the issue of not actually owning my money. If at any point my government decides that for some reason i owe them, they notify the bank and freeze all my accounts as it happened once already. For a 4k debt, i had my accounts frozen for a week, which mean i couldn't pay anyone for a week BUT i had to do ALL the footwork and paperwork during that week to solve my issue. That went without any prior notification or whatnot. I just woke up to frozen bank accounts that day.
Then there's the issue of speed and availability of services. I've lived through a few years of capital controls and I've had a few motherfuckers to tell me that i couldn't use my money nor send more than a K out of the country.
All these instances above are personal experiences and im not from either Nigeria nor a mountain village in the Andes.
Bottom line, i feel the current system is mugging me any chance it gets and all their scandals of the cocaine parties, fraudulent schemes and showoffs of extravagance on our expense that make it to the news every now and then don't help at all.
This is why im willing to do the extra work to cut any middleman out. This is why i support Bitcoin.

For starters, some of us only participate in that farce called the "US dollar" out of lack of alternatives. IF there is a faster and secure alternative, im willing to do the extra work to learn about it and use it.

The world doesn't revolve around you 'muricans, get over yourselves.
Also, the last part of your comment is really WTF? worthy. Literally the only person i know that has not directly ordered something online for the past month is my 60 year old mother. And even then, she did indirectly for some of the stuff she uses are imported.
My personal opinion is that it has all the foundation laid out for it to be adopted and implemented into our daily life. IF that happens is a matter of how the devs will play out their cards.

In pennies, it'd take about 9 20ft containers or 250 tons of pennies. I'd take it either way.

Give them only examples of daily use. You can't fit the hours your put into research into a 15 minute conversation and expect people to understand. I tried explaining technicals too but after a few minutes and a few looks of concern, like i just had a stroke and spoken nonsense, it started to dawn on me that it's like explaining car mechanics to a blonde supermodel. Sure you can try but everyone will think you're a f*cking idiot.

I have watched numerous videos from A. Antonopoulos and i have good understanding of bitcoin, i think. The problem that i see from my prespective is that these very points need a catalyst factor, which in this case is the many corrupt banking institutions (and not THE banks) and governments. These are subjects to change though, bitcoin or not. Just take a look at the steps EU has already taken to fight these very issues.
Bottom line is that Bitcoin **does** have the "stuff" it takes for an economic revolution but the world itself, as a whole, isn't so bad that there would be an economic revolt. I guess consumerism won.
Edit: We're saying the same thing basically with me refering to the modern world mostly which, for good or bad, is the one that dictates the rest of the world.

How has Bitcoin changed how you view money, value and the economy? If nothing else, digitizing money will make us less conscious about it rather than more (there have been several studies about the difference in our spending concience between cash and digital money).
In my opinion, bitcoin is just a transitional step in the history of money. No revolution is imminent.

Last time Time said something matters for freedom, a bunch of desert guys died. Im not sure how to feel with this knowledge.

Your points are fair but are also localized problems where this particular solution would help. This is far from a global economic revolt though, as many believe.

Yes, the rest of us tend to call them self centered assholes.
