People can [buy Mass Coin]( right now for a number of reasons. But, Mass Coin is needed to buy user's attention on the RTB network (via a Mass-enabled DMP that operates without detailed knowledge about Mass users and relies upon one-time access keys).
After the Mass ICO, Mass Coin will only be available on an exchange.

No, its not donations. You [buy Mass Coin with Bitcoin](

Why not BTC?
Mass thinks that the price of ad-placement on the network should be determined by supply/demand of ads as well as the overall health and appeal of the Mass ecosystem, itself. 
If we were to have all of this rely on Bitcoin, in addition to the two factors above, we would be introducing the fluctuating value of Bitcoin as another variable in determining the price of ads which would make the entire system vulnerable to any turbulence within the Bitcoin space. **We do not see this as a necessary risk.**
The Bitcoin Blockchain plays an important role in Mass Coin distribution and will hopefully become more vital once LightningNetwork (or some form of blockchain micro-payments) arrives. 
Until then, we want to embrace the liquidity and security that is available on the Blockchain but discard the volatility in order to create a stable, purely market-based value for transactions within the Mass Network.

Using Colu allows Mass Coin to be transparent, fast, and inherently secure due to its distributed nature. Colu's open source technology protocol (based on blockchain technology) allows for direct exchanges of digital money and is about as peer-to-peer as it gets.

Sarcasm is appreciated! But, they make lots and lots of money off of all of our digital breadcrumbs. Mass brings us back to parity. 
Doesn't having a browser extension to 1) filter-out irrelevant ads and 2)Pay you for any white-listed-by-you ads viewed sound nifty? That's Mass.

Again, Mass is not some click-bait scam where people "get paid to view ads". The main action is the filtering, like ad-blockers you are already used to. Once there are enough users, ad companies will need to start targeting you, the Mass User, as a new, attractive demographic. To target you requires Mass Coin (paid to you) and to show you an ad requires Mass Coin (paid to you).

* "They" are everyone in the game apart from internet users who provide that which is bought and sold, namely user data, and yet receive nothing.  
* Parity in regards to a seat at the table via market-driven pricing for ads as well as user attention. 
* AdBlock filters ALL ads except the ones allowed via their deals eg Google, FB. 
* It might be more or less than penny-shavings. The price for ad-placement on Mass Network will determined by market forces of supply and demand.

Mass does/will not have any ad revenue, ever. 
From  
    *Each participant of Mass ICO will receive[1,000,000,000,000 × (total
    amount of all deposits made to one individual account ÷ total amount
    Mass will reserve [1,000,000,000,000 × 0.3] coins altogether for its
    internal use.*
This is the only "revenue" Mass will have—from the ICO. The Mass portion of coins will cover development costs as well as provide a warchest for future development.

Unless you are part of the advertising system MASS will be an ad-blocker that pays you for your attention (if you use it). Does that sounds like a scam?

You will not "integrate" anything with ABP, you will use [Mass's ad-blocking browser or extension]( Brave is a new browser that blocks most ads but shows you its own ads. Neither Brave nor ABP compensate users. Mass does. Check out this [table] ( for a comparison. 


I agree. I think where we disagree is in your flagrant claim that Mass = ridiculous or pointless.

The FILTER comes first - there’ll be no payments in the beginning. Payments are to balance the system, not to attract users. Again, "we" don’t drive the price, Mass provide the marketplace—one, where there’s no discrimination. "We" just give the payment system and technology that allows trades to be done in a civilized way. We CANNOT drive the prices. Today’s prices are the result of the market forces but without users’ contribution. Again, it is totally ok, discriminated markets worked fine throughout history. East-Indian Company had great value. But, democratization comes to every aspect of life, sooner of later!
