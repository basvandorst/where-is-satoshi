I've discussed a lot of the security concerns with Aaron here - and I don't completely agree with him:
He's pretty much afraid that people losing their pin will lead to lost funds and a bad user experience.

The app is created by Aaron Voisine. 
The wallet is deterministic so the address changes. His argument against a pin is that the phone has one already. I'm considering forking the project to change symbol, units.
Aarons goal is simplicity and security (which is why it hasn't been released for jailbroken phones already).

Ok people. Let's clear some things up before they get out of hand.
Open source projects, like Bitcoin, usually have different roles.
In this case:
1) Owner (Satoshi -&gt; Gavin -&gt; Wladimir)
2) Maintainer (People with merge access = "Core Dev Team")
3) Contributor (People who contributed code that get's merged into the Bitcoin Core project)
Peter Todd is among the top contributors with 33 commits to the Bitcoin Core and reviews a ton of code.

There is no 51% attack. The majority hashrate decides the longest chain. Bitcoin is defined by the longest chain. 
Definition of changing PoW unless broken = altcoin.

Who is going to mine a block &gt; 1MB without 75% support?
@_date: 2017-03-30 09:17:19
It's basic economic sense that miners would make more money if the blocksize was higher - the only way it will get higher at this point in time is with a blocksize increase. 
Miners are signaling EB=1 because it wouldn't make sense to accept &gt;1MB when support is &lt;75%.
"Segwits sole purpose is to prevent a real blocksize increase" makes as much sense as what you wrote..
@_date: 2017-03-30 09:19:56


Miners have always decided what size they want to make the blocks - the only difference now is that they can't do it without a real blocksize increase. And only BU offers a realistic path to that at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:10:57
It doesn't matter if some nodes reject blocks, as the minority chain will naturally(or less naturally) come to a halt, making non-compliant nodes somewhat useless to the network. As far as I know the SPV wallets out there don't care if a tx is in a 1Mb block or a 16Mb block. 
Also you can't expect a node to reject a larger block just because it announces Bitcoin Core 3.1415 - Roger Ver seems confident his Unlimited nodes are being DDOS'ed so he's probably not announcing the version he's actually running for every node. Either way you can't rely on a number that's easily manipulated. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:20:58
In Bitcoin miners = userbase. That's the way it's always been. There's no other solid way of differentiating between legitimate users and random bots.
Miners don't want to keep fees high if it means less transactions. Any miner would prefer 8Mb at 10 cents/tx over 1Mb at 50 cents. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:06:42
There's no such thing as BTU.
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:33:02
The market is supposed to figure out what the fee is supposed to be. Right now it's an artificial limit that was never supposed to have any influence on the fee size. The scarcity of block space was never supposed to come from the blocksize but the actual cost of adding an extra tx to a block. 
Can you imagine if the price of water was determined the same way?? 
Blocks are not supposed to be full - it's structural market manipulation and everything Bitcoin was created to avoid. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:37:07
From a Bitcoin perspective it's not a problem. It works as intended. 
It also seems most miners want to make the switch to lower fee/tx compared to keeping the 1Mb spam limit. 
Bitcoin is designed to let the market decide.. So let's let the market decide.
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:04:52
Yes, centralization must be opposed. Especially centralized development. No single miner or developer can dictate what Bitcoin is. When several go together and continue working on the longest chain that's not a 51%-attack - that's CONSENSUS!
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:21:19
I don't specifically mean BU - I just mean that eventually someone will mine a block &gt;1Mb and the network will accept it. 
It can just as easily be Classic or a patched Core miner - though those are less likely to pull the trigger. 
BitFury could mine a 2Mb block tomorrow and this nightmare would be over. 


^Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:58:11


I mean - the whole idea of a BTU was spawned in this subreddit by Core supporters. To BU-supporters there is only one Bitcoin, with or without a 1MB blocksize limit. And that's got the ticker symbol BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:37:03


There's no such thing as BTU and there never will be. Noone is planning anything but a simple Bitcoin upgrade we should've done years ago.

@_date: 2017-03-31 10:37:35
It's fact. People have been pretty open about making an effort to spread the BTU FUD for the sake of discrediting a valid majority fork. 
I didn't know the truth could be twisted so many ways. It's so hard to see if people are deliberately trying to spread fake news or have genuinely fallen for stuff like this topic. 
Obviously it's a complete lie that BU "requires eventually removing the 21 million supply cap" but people still upvote it. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:06:36
No specific support needed. Just follow the longest chain and keep doing it. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 07:16:17
The problem here is that there is no "they" - BTU is an "idea" completely fabricated by pro-core propagandists to spread the false narrative that BU supporters have a destructive agenda. It's FUD and has nothing to do with reality.
@_date: 2017-03-30 09:05:31
Simple. Noone is going to mine a block &gt;1MB if miner support &lt;75%. This means that when it happens there will only be one chain - and it will obviously just be called Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:55:11
Blocking a blocksize increase while trying to force SW is what's causing the high fees - not the lack of SW. And dont say SW is a blocksize increase - it's not. SW doesn't change MAXBLOCKSIZE one bit.
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:58:49
Every implementation with a 1MB blocksize limit does a great job at breaking things. 
Higher transaction times and higher fees due to keeping an arbitrary limit that was due to be removed years ago is nuts and a bug you would not find in any professional piece of software. 
Keeping it is like keeping the dust limit at 0.01BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:20:44
Mining is more distributed now than it was 1, 2, or 3 years ago. Remember ghash.io?

BTU will never, ever, exist as a separate coin. The whole idea is absurd.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:01:55
I think you're wrong. The market has been screaming for higher block sizes and it looks like we'll have it within six months thanks to the market. And when that happens it looks like the minority will be forking off with a new PoW too... Though I hope not. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:35:18
No.. The longest chain decides which chain is the majority. That's why we'll have to wait a few weeks/months before seeing &gt; 1MB blocks. 1MB core blocks are the majority.. This week. Last 24 hours 52.8%. Who knows about next week. And if some miners have secretly upgraded. 
The vast majority of clients out there are SPV clients - not full nodes. SPV clients don't care about blocksize but just follow the longest chain. That also means most actual users will follow the longest chain. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 07:24:51
There will never be a minority chain signaling BU. BTU is propaganda nonsense. 
If there's ever going to be a minority chain that needs a separate ticker symbol it's going to be the one which doesn't remove maxblocksize... for about 24 hours.

Mining nodes work on extending the blockchain. Since non-mining nodes can't extend the blockchain they are irrelevant in this context.
Obvious to anyone that section only applies to mining nodes. "Working on" = mining.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:24:13
Your reply has nothing to do with deciding what blocks are valid. If your node doesn't mine it has no influence on what blocks are valid. 
Mining nodes decide what blocks are valid by extending the longest chain. Just like it says in your quote. 
If non-mining nodes had any say in what blocks are valid then nothing stops me from spawning a millions nodes and deciding for you. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:16:10
Nodes can verify if a block matches certain criteria - sure. However, nodes have NO influence on what a block look like.
If there's consensus between a majority of miners that a hard fork is needed then nodes only have two options: 1) Stay on broken Bitcoin and receive no new blocks 2) Upgrade
The single most important incentive for miners is profit and miners' profit is directly tied to Bitcoin being the best it can be. If Bitcoin is insecure, expensive or inefficient then miners have greater incentive to fix it than to listen to whatever a random non-mining-node wants. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:36:24
If you don't mine you're not part of the consensus mechanism of Bitcoin. It's what keeps Bitcoin safe from one person spawning 1000000 nodes and deciding for everyone else.
What prevents a single miner from putting a 1000BTC gift in a block is that other miners would not extend that chain.
Sure, Bitfury can make an invalid block - but that chain wouldn't be extended. 
ONLY miners decide what chain they want to extend. Non-mining nodes CANNOT decide what chain to extend. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:09:32
Omg.. a single guy in China *sigh* You have no idea how pools work do you? Bitcoin mining has NEVER been as decentralized as it is now. Three years ago one pool had 50% - now no pool even comes close to 25%. And obviously Antpool isn't wholly owned by Bitmain but comprised of many independent miners who can easily point their hashrate elsewhere.
Proof-of-work is definitely in the whitepaper. It's what makes Bitcoin possible and sybil-proof - unlike node counts which can easily be faked. 
Your quote further up shows exactly that miners are in control. In the whitepaper nodes "working on extending the blockchain" can only be one thing: miners.
If you think it's a bad thing miners are in control then you don't get Bitcoin - miners are incentivized to make Bitcoin better. If miners make Bitcoin worse in ANY kind of way they are just damaging their own profits.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:42:38
Most hashrate = Bitcoin. Read the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:57:45
You can't turn things on it's head once again - your node can't both be against the block rules that miners follow and have miners following it. 
If I decide to change the rules of my node(let's say I only accept blocks that includes tx's to my wallet and not from it) I can't expect to have miners following it - it's obviously the other way around. 
Bitcoin works because miners are allowed to be selfish. Consensus only applies to miners because only miners can have any influence on the blocks created. 0-hashrate nodes have 0 influence on the blocks created.
You can choose to accept or reject the blocks miners create - you can't decide what rules the blocks are created under. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:36:44
For digital p2p cash, current fees are not reasonable. When have you ever paid a 1$ fee to pay in cash?
The high fees are keeping millions of people from using Bitcoin for the most common cash use cases.
On one hand you want most of Africa to be able to spin up nodes by keeping the blocksize down - but you're missing the point that that also keeps fees higher than what millions of people make in a day. If you can't pay a tx fee a day - you sure can't pay to run a node, no matter how low the bs limit is.
If governments started shutting down current nodes we'd start spinning up new nodes faster than they could take them down. As long as Bitcoin can't realistically be shut down, Bitcoin is decentralized.
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:16:56
Only mining nodes can work on extending the blockchain as described in the whitepaper. You can try to twist the truth as much as you like - that doesn't change anything. No matter how many passive nodes I spin up they will NEVER define the blockchain - only active nodes that work on extending the blockchain can do that.


But everyone else won't - and there's no way for you to know which nodes are legit and which are trying to change the rules. If non-mining nodes had any say in rules then you, me, miners, or anyone else can just spawn 10000 nodes that match their wanted behaviour.
Luckily we have *proof-of-work* - non-mining nodes don't have ANY SAY AT ALL.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:08:46
Non-mining nodes have no influence on the blockchain at all. I don't know how much clearer I can tell you. If you change your node rules you won't get any new blocks. If miners change the rules with consensus(among miners) the blockchain happily moves along - as intended and described in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2016-12-07 13:38:07
I disagree. Bitcoin transactions are recorded in the Blockchain - LN transactions are not, just settled eventually. Cash isn't returned to you if the counterparty reneges, so that's another point that LN isn't cash. Not settling every transaction takes the p2p cash out of p2p electronic cash system.
I wouldn't say LN is a bad thing but insisting that adding a whole new way of transacting has the purpose of "keeping things the same" is a terrible logical fallacy. 
LN is a political nightmare though, because it is still used(through SW) to keep the arbitrary and effectively market regulating blocksize limit hostage even though there's a clear consensus on increasing it to somewhere between 2MB and infinity(leaving it up to the market).
For some strange reason we're postponing doing what we all(well the vast majority anyway) agree on just because there's something else everyone doesn't agree on. It doesn't make any sense.

You're not answering my questions. 
Bitcoin is not supposed to have full blocks: 
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:58:03
You are incorrect in the assumption that a miner has to fill a block. If miners wanted an edge instead of tx fees they could just mine smaller blocks - which is probably what'll happen if the block size is set very high/unlimited. You wouldn't mine a 200Mb block if everyone else is mining 4Mb blocks.
@_date: 2016-12-07 18:00:53
There IS a clear consensus on increasing the block size - I didn't say anything about Bitcoin Unlimited. I make up my own mind and try to stay clear of the us-vs-them-thinking. Where exactly did you get that Core or anyone else will never implement a blocksize increase? What normal user downloads the entire blockchain? I seriously doubt more than 1% of the current nodes would have any trouble with an increased blocksize. Who runs a node on a 1Mbit connection? When I buy new disks I go with 2x3TB in RAID 1 - and that's not even for production use. Prove me wrong - not with talk - proof.
p2p doesn't mean every node has to be online all the time and it certainly doesn't mean everyone should be seeding the blockchain.
And then you suggest I go read propaganda? *sigh* Love how you just put everyone in boxes..
LN requires miner and user support - it's not going to happen without it. "There's no way you big blockers can stop it." - good luck forcing consensus. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 15:17:34
50/50 at best - when you decide to orphan a block other miners will already be mining on top of the longest chain which means you'll be increasing your risk of getting orphaned. You need to be sure other miners are mining on YOUR chain - if not, you waste coins instead of mining them.
Also - like Peter Todd says - it's easily solved by using nLocktime. If it was ever remotely close to becoming a problem it could be fixed as easy as flipping a switch.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:18:20

But! If everyone uses that fee and there's a backlog of 2Mb worth of transactions that fee won't get your tx in the next block.. Or the next one.. Or the next one.. Until finally the backlog clears or the fee drops back below the fee you set. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 08:15:15
You're saying a wire transfer is more like cash - than CASH.
Bitcoin is supposed to be p2p cash - not eGold, iSWIFT or something. 
Segwit is cool but arguing it's "just an update" is just plain wrong - it changes the p2p cash nature of Bitcoin.
Edit: Payment channels != cash for clarification.
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:37:19
I can't believe you really believe this. If your node has a different opinion about what blocks are valid than a majority of miners then only one thing will happen to your 0-hashrate node: It won't get any new blocks. 
It is so clearly written in the whitepaper it shouldn't be possible to misunderstand: You mine on top of blocks you consider valid to extend the chain. The longest chain only contains valid blocks by definition - and if you have 0 hashrate, you have 0 influence. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:20:01
P2P electronic cash! It works!
I had to wait 6 blocks with a 12 cent fee but I probably had the wrong default block size setting on my node or something else I could've easily changed..

Losing 1-2% of nodes but gaining 100-800% capacity(+Segwit boost) = more users = more nodes != less nodes.

You didn't answer my questions. 52GB is only if blocks are full. 
8MB max blocksize != 416GB/year. 
Nonetheless my nodes wouldn't be going down if it was 416GB/year.
The two important questions here are: How many nodes would go offline? How many nodes are needed? You haven't answered either.

@_date: 2017-08-26 13:41:29
In Bitcoin the only measurable consensus is between miners and the only consensus that matters for Bitcoin. It's right there in the whitepaper.
Miners run nodes too and if Bitcoin upgrades with consensus and you don't then you'll simply be left behind.
You can try to twist the truth as much as you want but anyone who understands the whitepaper will know you are completely wrong.
@_date: 2016-12-13 12:09:07
That's very hypothetical and very far from reality. By orphaning the top block - essentially forking - miners risk being forked off themselves and obviously they're not going to risk that. Who'd take a 50/50 at best bet instead of just taking the new transactions(+whatever the block reward)? Worst case - lose everything. Best case - get a few more transactions and a reputation as a malicious miner. 
Miners have plenty of incentive to follow the longest chain instead of orphaning on purpose. You are still not making sense. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 20:12:36
You got it turned around: wants it to be digital cash. wants to turn it into digital gold transacted on a new layer and settled on the Bitcoin blockchain.

@_date: 2016-12-09 18:42:14
I disagree - it's very broken. Broken by an arbitrary limit that wasn't put in place to regulate the market like what is happening now. A single person who decides to waste money to fill up a block is welcome to do so - that's how Bitcoin is supposed to work. Do you wan't to change how Bitcoin is supposed to work?
Blocks are not supposed to be full and miners decide the block size - not users. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:49:39
You're the one spreading misinformation - fees and transaction times are high because blocks are full and people are sick of the stalemate.

If Bitcoin is useless as an actual currency it should be obvious that the people who want to actually use a currency go elsewhere. 
There's no reason Bitcoin shouldn't work as a currency but somehow someone has blocked all progress for three years. Schnorr, mast, segwit *sigh* None of those things are worth anything if only the 1% can use them.
I remember when fees were 10-20cents and blocks were starting to get full - people called me crazy when I said fees would be over 1$ if we didn't get a blocksize increase.. Now it's 5$.
What fee is too high now? 50$? 1000$? 1 Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:31:57
That's even more stupid. If I mine a tx of my own and get the 5$ back I'm missing out on someone paying me 5$. The sum is the same.

With that logic anything miners do with overwhelming consensus is a 51% attack - the funny thing is that includes SW. 
 Segwit as a soft-fork is not backwards compatible. It is true and I think you know it is. Older nodes participate in the forked protocol without giving errors, but they do not preserve their functionality, e.g. they do not continue to protect users' funds by verifying signatures (because they can not see these). 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:05:15

Maybe it's time to update the fee description - "a few cents" isn't really the case right now or in the near future.
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:40:43
SW does change the protocol as old nodes won't be able to handle new blocks. It doesn't change _consensus rules_ but that is not how the sub rules are worded.
What about PoW change? I've seen that discussed here in the last week and that sure didn't have "overwhelming consensus"
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:06:47

@_date: 2017-04-01 19:22:19
"Didn't define what an attack is"? If 75-95% of blocks support something it's not an attack - it's consensus.
And who exactly is supposed to define what an attack is if not by the consensus mechanism in the whitepaper? In Bitcoin there is only one sybil-proof way of figuring this out = hashrate.

You suppose a lot. Neither of those things were the case with the proposed PoW-change that should've have been disallowed according to the rules. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:08:02
Whether a topic is against the rules has nothing to do with these hypotheticals. The actual case had nothing to do with any of them but was in case of an upgrade that the topic author didn't like that could reach consensus as described in the whitepaper.
What seems to be inconsistent here is when rules are enforced and when they're not.
No matter how you look at it a PoW-change hard fork without overwhelming consensus is not allowed here - or can I start a discussion/proposition like that if I believe SW is an attack on Bitcoin with the stated goal of destroying it?(Not that I want to)
@_date: 2017-04-01 16:46:00
"It was brought up" and for some reason wasn't disallowed even though it was a clear violation of the rules. Miners decide what blocks they want to orphan - nothing is broken about that and it's the way it's always been.

@_date: 2017-10-11 19:56:34
I suggest you take a look anywhere. NYA has obvious community consensus.
Even Bitcoin.org has a beautiful list showing a vast majority supporting the upgrade:

Read what Satoshi meant in the white paper in the link I just provided. Bitcoin doesn't work if nodes don't follow the chain with the most work.
Bitcoin only works because the most work *defines* consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:45:37
"Being friends of decentralization" *sigh*
Blindly following one very centralized dev team and their dictate sure is "decentralized". Keeping Bitcoin crippled so centralized nodes/hubs will be necessary to do any kind of scaling sure is "decentralized" *sigh*
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:22:12
The chain with the most work MUST be the valid one.

I disagree. An extra layer of offline protection does in no way make it appropriate to store your private keys on an online device. ..which'll also delete your private keys if you drop it on the floor.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:02:52
This is so 100% spot on. It's sad it's buried in this thread. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:35:21
So.. Is this what you call "backwards compatible"?
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:27:00
Your argument makes the same sense as "Erik would no longer have a problem if the blocksize was 4MB, larger blocks work fine on an altcoin"
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:36:59
Incorrect again. The 2010 and 2012 forks were very much intentional. 
UASF is an altcoin or at the very least an intentional attack on Bitcoin. Dropping valid blocks and only building on a new chain with different rules is one or the other - you decide which. It certainly won't make Bitcoin an altcoin. 
UASF will never happen as no hashrate will be backing it. A few nodes can reject all the blocks they want - they'll only be useless after Aug 1st. 
But considering most of them are already useless because they're just spun up in the same datacenters it doesn't matter much - it's pretty obvious that's what's happening when hundreds of nodes go offline at the same instant. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:20:26
Even Satoshi talked about when Bitcoin reaches Visa-levels most people will be using spv. There just needs to be a enough nodes - that doesn't mean nodes need to be run by everyone. Like webservers.
My evidence is economics so simple anyone should be able to understand them - if miners do something bad the demand will drop and the price will fall = miners lose money if they do anything bad. 
Miners could collude to make 300kb blocks(making the fees much higher) but they choose not to because it's bad for users and therefore bad for business.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:59:23
Funny. I'm from Denmark.
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:59:53
If normal transactions are no longer "secure" it's not compatible.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:20:49
That's the same thing as saying a 1Gb block size only causes a chain split if malicious miners refuse to comply *sigh*
Defining a hard fork as a chain forking change is very common - but it's good to know there's someone around to dictate definitions /s
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:43:52
If someone manages to mine an invalid block it won't cause a chain split.. If I mine a 2MB block I won't cause a chain split... I'll just lose money. 
If miners don't join UASF they will mine according to the old rules but will accept UASF blocks - but if Bitfury(for example) enforces UASF rules they will cause a chain split because they'll only be mining on top of their own blocks. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:54:59

New users willing to gamble? Check. Eastern exchange(s) pushing prices up? Check. Technical issues to blame when the price goes tumbling a few times? Check.
Bitcoin should grow but the current spike has more in common with January 2014 than it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:33:52
When no pool has over 20% mining power I see it as much bigger centralization problem to have Blockstream dictating the direction and development of Bitcoin. Remember when ghash.io had around 50% hashrate? 
Segwit is fine but it does represent a strong political centralization.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:20:03
What "story"? Denying what exactly?
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:12:38
I say around four because of different definitions - which seem to be hard for the community. A good way to look at it will be: Soft fork = node upgrades optional. Hard fork = node upgrades required.
2010, 2012, 2013.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:51:54
I tell the truth as best I can with the info available. Maybe you do the same - if so you've been drinking from a poisoned well.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:53:36
Node centralization is not a problem and I see no evidence it will be a problem in a future where miners decide the size they're willing to make blocks. If they make them too big - they lose money. If they make them too small - they lose money. If miners do anything bad - they lose money.
It's a very fundamental part of Bitcoin and it's been like that - and worked - since the whitepaper. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:03:57
No dictatorship, no centralization, no Blockstream!
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:52:12
All this UASFCoin crap really should be removed from this sub. It's against sub rules. No matter how you look at it UASF tries to fundamentally change Bitcoin and it doesn't have overwhelming community support - at all. That is against the rules of this sub.
If you disagree show me non-sybilled proof of overwhelming support.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:41:03
Bitcoin is intentionally left broken to force SW. Fixing Bitcoin first has the benefit of letting people decide and not being forced due to a hostage situation.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:08:20
That could just as easily have been a comment from someone advocating BU. 
And if BU is off limits in this sub because it doesn't have "overwhelming support" then this should be too.

You are so misguided if you think I'm a troll or a shill. I've been around since 2014 and noticed how Bitcoin development went completely off track and into the arms of AXA.
I'm not even against SW - I'm just against using it to stall real Bitcoin development and progress.

You're correct - if you're running a UASFCoin node, Bitcoin hashrate doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:43:47
You are a perfect example of my point and you still don't get it! Oh the irony!
If miners increase the block reward that is exactly what's going to happen - price drop because you and a million other people dump their coins! 
What keeps miners from misbehaving isn't the blocksize - it's basic economics and the incentives described in the whitepaper. 
You don't need to run a node to USE bitcoin and it's value is in it USE - not in running a node. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:21:25
So.. you're saying Bitcoin isn't decentralized at the moment? Because right now we only have a few thousand nodes servicing hundreds of thousands of users (at least)..
I guess we should softfork to 10kb blocks immediately so my friend on Pitcairn can run a node and Bitcoin can become more decentralized! /s
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:59:59
If they were not hard forks then go ahead and spin up a 0.5 node and see how well it works. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:39:51
I'm very happy to hear that :)
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:56:42
You say the value is not in its use and then goes on to describe the value is in how you USE it to have 100% decentralized control over your money. 
For that you don't even need an spv wallet let alone a full node - just a private key you can derive public keys from and any random node you can broadcast a transaction to. 
I'm not trying to make you stop running a node - it's great you want to but you don't need it to get any of the things you describe :)
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:47:45
Not a smart way of investing your money. If the price wasn't rising you'd lose a lot of money... And since the price has gone up you'd have earned a lot more more by simply buying Bitcoin.

Bitmain hardly even owns all the hashrate on Antpool - a lot of that can float freely to another pool if Bitmain misbehaves. 
Would be nice if Jihan would publish how much is Bitmain-owned hardware.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:25:36
So essentially Bitfury is promoting a contentious hard fork on Aug 1st? UASF == UAHF?
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:51:02
If the internet suddenly got completely crippled for everyone we'd have much bigger problems..
The fact is - Bitcoin doesn't need the bottom 90% of internet connections to run full nodes for Bitcoin to work or to be decentralized.
1000's of nodes around the world can service millions of (spv) users. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:03:33
List four (real) problems. I don't think you can find "lots" of problems that are likely to occur if activation happens at 75% miner adoption. The remaining 25% will follow or waste money.
@_date: 2016-07-08 21:58:35
Stop trolling already.
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:49:03
I disagree. People running full Bitcoin nodes have no problem updating their browser.
If the hard fork doesn't go through it simply won't activate = nothing to lose.
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:58:16
Let me rephrase that: I have yet to see compelling arguments against fixing the current problem while we wait for the proposed solutions. I see some people disagree and that makes hard forking hard, I just honestly don't see why. From a miner's perspective most of all: Selling more pizzas makes more sense than increasing the cost of a slice. People want more pizza now, people are starving. Pizza today sounds a lot better than gourmet dinner in a couple of months - especially when one doesn't exclude the other.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:37:33
Your logic is so flawed. What percentage of Bitcoin users should run full nodes for Bitcoin to qualify as "decentralized" in your opinion?
Obviously the current level of decentralization is more than adequate. My Bitcoins are more than safe.
If you don't think so then exactly what harm does the current "centralization" do?
@_date: 2016-07-10 09:40:17
Yeah - sorry bout dumbing it down but the outcome is the same. They are mining with new transactions as they come in, and if no new transactions have come in - in the few seconds since the last block - the block is mined with no transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:45:06
How is it a soft fork if it causes a chain split fork? And how isn't it contentious if there is no sybil-proof proof that anyone but Bitfury wants it?
Seriously - it doesn't make sense to me.
@_date: 2016-07-07 23:07:34
Again - I have no problem running a node on my laptop. 2mb + SW solves the problem right now. Other solutions may work later - if they do that's great but right now they're not available.
@_date: 2016-07-08 13:56:14
SW will have an effect but nowhere near soon enough - that's why a hard fork is needed. This issue is scaring new users away and it'll get worse the longer we wait - and it's a lot worse than people not running full nodes on their laptop.

The article makes it sound like intentionally leaving Bitcoin worse than it could be is a good thing.
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:52:53
Right now the 1mb limit is the  distraction from working on other solutions. 2mb buys time and time is what's needed to find other solutions - if the other solutions work there won't be any reason to increase it again.
I have yet to see any logical arguments.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:33:21
You dont get how mining works it seems.. Antpool also got the previous block - five SECONDS - earlier. 
When a block is found all chosen transactions in the mempool are added to it - in this case they were so close no new transactions were recorded by antpool. 
Either they publish the block and get 25BTC or they wait and get nothing. All pools do it when they're exceptionally lucky.
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:57:52
If 5% of the network start rejecting blocks that doesn't conform to new rules it does.
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:24:53
Bitmain probably doesn't even control 80% of the Antpool miners. So no - obviously Bitmain doesn't have hashrate majority.
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:18:18
I don't see why that's a reason not to try? If people run outdated versions it's very unlikely they have anything to lose.
We have nothing to lose by trying but right now we're losing a lot by not trying.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:57:20
It's pretty simple math. Take the money you have spent on equipment and let's say you bought at 850$ a few months ago instead - you'd have tripled your investment just by holding. Instead of tripling your money it sounds like you are just breaking even.
Not to mention the electricity you could have sold.
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:46:31
I can run a Bitcoin node on my laptop just fine and I dont see why that will change with 2mb. How many cents will 0-1mb extra every 10 minutes for the next five years cost me assuming current $/Tb prices? Not enough to make me shut down nodes.
Did I say anything about not wanting SW? 2Mb + SW is the best readily available solution we have and I don't see why some people oppose it. It was in the HK consensus after all.
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:51:01
You seems to miss the fact that if Antpool misbehaves - according to it's current users - they can lose the hastrate Bitmain doesn't own. And obviously Bitmain doesn't own all the hardware mining on Antpool. 
Bitfury on the other hand is 100% Bitfury - making it the biggest miner. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:12:03
What's with the labeling? I want 2mb blocks so Bitcoin doesn't deteriorate further while we wait.
Also - have you seen the torrents on The Pirate Bay? Public torrents have plenty of seeds. I run two nodes myself and an increase from 1Mb to 2Mb wont change that.
And why is your Reddit account only a week old? Sounds like you've been in this community a lot longer.
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:41:08
But when you talk about BIP148 causing a split you say the exact opposite.. go figure..
What matters is: 5% fork off = altcoin. 80% fork = Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:17:55
Riddled with fallacies. If people don't care about transaction cost the why should an increase in cost of running a node result in a negative amount of nodes? After all people freely seed when using BitTorrent and get nothing in return except for a network that works. Increasing from 1Mb to 2Mb is not equal to 2Mb blocks right away - and miners decide whether a bigger block(with extra fees) is worth the extra orphan risk, the max block size doesn't dictate how big a block miners choose to make. 
Has anyone got numbers on the actual difference in cost per block size? Extra disk space: cents. Extra bandwidth: cents. Extra electricity: &lt;cents. 
Increased mining cost vs extra fees per block: +ROI.
I have yet to see compelling arguments why the block size hasn't been increased a year ago.
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:04:02
BIP148 *is* the rule violation by rejecting valid blocks. Miners don't have to make invalid blocks - their valid as ever blocks will also be rejected by the UASF-altcoin.
If you disagree with the 5% then go ahead and prove it - no sybils allowed in Bitcoin.
