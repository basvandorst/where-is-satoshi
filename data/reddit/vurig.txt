Who cares your investment is down 90%, it could've gone down 900%!

I feel like half of the people asking this question are 16 year olds who don't mind a $100 electricity bill going to their parents so that they can mine $10 of bitcoin.

Fucking hell, that's not what the study says at all. Lazy article. 
The study says 25% would invest in bitcoin, given the choice to invest $1000 in bitcoin, gold, real estate, stocks or bonds. Only 4% of the millennials who answered have ever actually bought bitcoin.

After all the talk in this sub I'm almost thinking the effect of bitcoin on BBT viewership is going to be bigger than the other way around...

It's in most bitcoin holder's best interest to encourage people to keep buying. You'll have to inform yourself and make your own decision, preferably looking at information from multiple sources.
You could win big, you could lose big. Don't spend any money you can't afford to lose. Don't be that guy taking out a 10k loan to buy bitcoin.

Exactly. What if you take out a big loan you couldn't easily pay back with a job, buy bitcoin with it, then it drops 50% and takes 2 years to get even...

There's a difference between taking some risk and reckless behaviour that could leave people with significant debt, especially if they don't really know what they're doing.

For all the people who bought bitcoin in the last 3 or 4 months it's mostly irrelevant how low it was a year ago.
