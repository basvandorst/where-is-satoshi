If it is not HEX style it could be a brain wallet. sha256 it and you should get the Secret Exponent.
Not very secure solution would be trying to import it into blockchain.info (they support many private key versions) but it may be worth the risk.

Have you confirmed the e-mail?
I made 0.05 BTC withdrawal today and it went fine (except from the acceptable 5 min delay of the confirmation e-mail).

Keep your core ON for a week (so it can re-send the TX in case it drops from the mempool) and they will eventually be included in a block.
I was able to send two free transaction in February~March. The first one was included in 2 days of waiting. The second one in 4 days.
If you really wanted it happen in a day you should include **at least** a 5k satoshi/kb fee.
Anyway don't trust blockchain.info's priority estimation.

If you store the blockchain on HDD. Stop the bitcoin client - defragment - start the bitcoin client again. You will be surprised from the difference!

How you got 15FeNPVZboYWyNv8U5J9VL5VLqkhHDJCYC in your wallet?
Have you imported it from an empty paper wallet found online?
Best idea - delete it (if possible). You don't want your wallet to send your change by mistake there, right?

This is not a console command. Either shutdown your node and start it with:
    bitcoin-qt.exe -maxconnections=24
or put
    maxconnections=24
in bitcoin.conf in your data dir (where wallet.dat is). And restart.
There are other useful commands at:

6 * 24 * 30 = 4.3GB of block data per month all the rest comes from the mempool "spam".
With segwit and/or larger block size the mempool data usage is going to drop.
Limit the max number of nodes your client can connect to 24 or less and your data usage will drop. I don't suggest disabling your mempool because this 0.12 "feature" is too buggy.
Anyway 80GB of data usage per month is nothing nowadays. I'm more concerned that it does 40GB of wear a day on my SSD.

Go to Europe. If you care about your life don't even try the "solutions" you will read here.

Compared to burning directly electricity to heat - yes (getting heat + getting few extra satoshi). It may be worth if you get the miner for free :)
Compared to an Air Conditioner (most nowadays ACs have COP between 4 and 6 which means under certain climate conditions you will get 4~6 KWh of heat for 1 KWh of electricity). - not really.
Re-working the miner and connecting it to your water heater may be the way to go. But depending where you live a solar installation may be even more economical.

You are running it on HDD right?
* Stop the wallet.
* defragment the partition
* start the wallet with

Import private keys in bitcoin core.
Enable "Coin control".
Group inputs in a sensible/acceptable way. Ignore the amounts that are "too small" to be worth.
Anyway you have also 2*4.6 CLAMS worth 0.011 BTC

Looking at the history of 1CNjkLzcbygnLAuDgxz4ULVHByjFR5ZYX and 19LLV3sXJygHwo46jbbbmYf8WrTafGiywq (where the 7.5 BTC ended-up) you've send 0.09115706 BTC a 6 months ago too.
Enabling "coin control" in your client will give you more details about what you have and where you have it.

What do you mean by "mining limit"?
@_date: 2016-07-25 13:35:59
With the original block size limit and min 10k satoshi required by the miners you get 3.2BTC/block from a full blocks (BTC would need to be around $2500 to sustain the current hash rate with the current hardware). Ofc if the blocks are full ppl would pay more. If we compare to the current situation 70k~90k/kb average then the miners would get 22~29BTC/block.
Nobody knows what is going to happen in the next years. Hope segwit and the other new developments will bring new life to bitcoin.
