What's odd are these half-truths you're propagating as gospel to judge the guy, TO other people. Yes, the guy has an isolation tank in his house. Yes, he's done DMT. To my knowledge (&amp; I've listened to most of his podcasts), he never did the DMT in the tank. He sometimes smokes or eats weed &amp; goes in there, but often not. &amp; since when is a plant a drug, &amp; since when do people need to be supervised whilst partaking in it?
Since you're so concerned, one thing he does advocate is if you're going to do mushrooms or ayahuasca (he's never done acid), do it in a safe environment, preferably, yes, with someone who's done it before.
Finally (gettin' a little ranty, sorry  ;o) , Bitcoin really started BECAUSE the financial system is so fucked. Natural "drugs", partaken occasionally &amp; responsibly, seem to me to be a remedy AWAY from the strict dog-eat-dog/shadow derivative economy-type mentality that ran out of control. To me, THAT reality was pretty out there, &amp; bitcoin is something looking to restore sanity.

Dunning was on there to "address" stuff he kinda made up (no sources) in a 2008 article about Rogan. It was irresponsible for Dunning to post it in the 1st place.
&amp; people cling to this "douche/conspiracy nut/stoner" cliche about the guy because they're busy, a small celebrity (pre-podcast) comes on their radar, &amp; they form an ironclad opinion &amp; move on. It's how most people deal with life (heck, look at religion), &amp; REALLY how people act on the internet---except they take that scintilla of bad information &amp; preach it as gospel.

Rogan's podcast is top 20 (overall on iTunes), sometimes top-10 (the episodes are always individually top 10).

If you care about bitcoin, you care about the future of something (a la money). If you care about podcasts, you care about the future of something (a la talk radio). On the iTunes podcast chart, the Rogan Experience garners millions of listeners, &amp; is often in the top-ten overall, with all the NPR programs, as well as the Stuff you Should Know, Freakonomics, &amp; Radiolab podcasts. Really, he might the most popular independent podcaster in the world, *&amp;* he's the main commentator of the fastest growing sport, one that just garnered a 700 million contract with Fox &amp; is worth 2 billion (MMA &amp; the UFC). So, ya'know, instead of rank &amp; quick negativity, maybe look into why this might be a good thing for the thing you care about, &amp; why some people are actually excited about it.

Brian has been asked by Joe now to not come on some of the more important, "serious discussion"-y shows now. He was probably asked to come yesterday because Brian *does* has a minuscule tech history, &amp; started off as the main tech guy for the show.
Plus, often he does a nice job just adding the silly or the levity in quick bursts. Haven't heard yet, dunno what he did yesterday.
