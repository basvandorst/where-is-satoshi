Partly true.  A napkin IOU must be signed by the promisor and have consideration ($ or something given in return by the promisee) to be a valid contract.  A verbal promise can be contract if there is offer + acceptance + consideration, but the applicable Statue of Frauds sometimes requires there to be a written agreement to be enforceable (e.g., for the sale of real estate or goods over $500).  
The real problem is proving what the deal was in court, where the costs can quickly exceed the money you spent in the first place.  A verbal promise or napkin contract don't clearly define the terms and leave tons of room for debate, which can quickly devolve into a he-said, she-said situation with no clear outcome.
Is there a contract involving the colored coin?  It would really depend on the facts.  Lets assume A issues the coin to B, and B sells it to C.  C wants to redeem the coin from A.  Since A and C are not in privity, there would need to be two valid contracts here: A's sale to B and B's assignment of its rights under that sale to C.  If in each case there were some evidence of the offer (A sends an email saying he promises to exchange the coin for a car, B emails C saying he promises to assign his rights to the car) and acceptance + consideration (both would be covered by paying $ to the promisor), then I would argue that valid contracts do exist and that C does have a claim against A for the car.  Of course, if A refuses to honor the coin then the strength of C's claim in court will greatly depend on the evidence he has (emails, payment receipts, etc.) to back it up.  He could also argue promissory estoppel, but that's a another can of worms.
