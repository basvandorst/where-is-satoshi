You're right. Spending bitcoins is more comparable to using a debt card than a credit card.

You should never fake information when you're dealing with money. You've probably lost it for good now.

China has the largest population of any nation and will likely have the largest economy within the next decade. Bitcoin being banned effectively makes sure that it will never be used in the world's largest market, which is a huge blow to the currency.

Yes, the fantastic time that was the gilded age, where multiple depressions occurred less then twenty years apart from each other and contractionary monetary policies led to a major debt issue for millions of Americans.

You don't need a middleman for everyday transaction is dollars though. Even if you use a debt card the worst that it would come to is a pretty small monthly fee from your bank. Mine doesn't even charge so long as I make at least 5 transactions a month so it is far easier for me to buy things online with a debt card than it is to use bitcoin.

If noone uses bitcoin as currency then it will fail and become worthless. The entire point is for bitcoin to become a currency, not a commodity.

The deflationary nature of BTC encourage people to hoard it instead of spend it. This could be a problem as it discourages trade and works against its establishment as a currency. Just look at this subbreddit. Most of the posts are about how everyone's going to be rich when BTC is worth $10,000. BTC cannot be used widely as a currency until its value stabilizes because of this.
