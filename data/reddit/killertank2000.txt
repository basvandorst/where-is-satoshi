I've factored most of that in. I know my elec rate. I've been averaging only 2% downtime. My wife is a stay at home mom, so she checks the miners every couple hours. 
The difficulty is absolutely the biggest variable.

Thank you! I've seen a dozen calculators, but this one is the best by far. According to that one, I am profitable, but barely. I will clear approximately 4 more BTC on top of the 1.5 I've already earned after paying for electricity. So I am profitable, but barely. :-)

after I wget the start.sh file, I run sudo ./start.sh I get this:
./start.sh: line 289: install_armory_companion: command not found

afterwards, if I open my armory folder, there is "armory companion" and "armory companion python" folders... 
I never get prompted for the menu. It just runs the script and then puts out a bunch of errors...

Never mind. I think I see the problem. Line 289 should read "function install_armory_companion"... and lines 353 and 354 are missing the end quotation marks
I'm gonna try again
