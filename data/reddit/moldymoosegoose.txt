Oh dear god. You guys are creating more and more comedy gold by the second. His sentencing was due to running a criminal enterprise which included murder for hire. It does NOT matter that it was not what the original charge was for. This is the sentencing summary. Do all of you here really just jerk each other off with absolutely incorrect information and repeat it over and over? 


But – contrary to Ulbricht’s absurd suggestion in his sentencing submission that these murder-for-hire attempts were mere “masquerade” or “role-playing,” (Def.’s Ltr. dated May 22, 2015, at 37) – Ulbricht clearly believed that all of the murders were real and intended for them to occur. He paid for them with $650,000 in Bitcoins – transferred directly from a Bitcoin wallet on his laptop. He coldly noted the arrangement and execution of the murders-for-hire in entries in his “log” file on his computer.
He tried to hire hitmen. What the fuck is wrong with you people?
Edit: Read the responses below and tell me this isn't the dumbest group of people you could ever imagine. Repeated references to "he wasn't charged with that though". It's almost as if none of you have ANY idea what this case was actually about nor how sentencing works. It's almost as if....you're all 15.

He tried to use a hitman to kill someone's roommate that wasn't involved at all. So...no.

I don't think you guys understand. The DA makes a claim, the defense refutes it. That is literally how it works. They didn't refute any of this because it was obviously him.

Change the world with murder for hire! This is one of the big Bitcoin advocates folks. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 19:53:23
That's not really what happened. He wasn't SENTENCED for murder, he was sentenced based off of EVERYTHING he did while running the criminal enterprise which could include a life sentence depending on the severity of what he did. That just happened to ALSO include murder for hire which increased his already long sentence. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:37:29


Yes, I literally say this in my comment. He was charged with running a criminal enterprise. His SENTENCE was so high because it ALSO included murder for hire. Sentencing takes into account many things which is why I linked it above. I'm not sure if you read it or not but it's written by a lawyer and not a commenter.
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:33:15
His lawyer didn't even deny he tried to hire people for murder so I'm not even sure what you're getting at here.

I wrote this up to convince him to stop writing the trash he types up. I'm so sick of reading it so I'm basically venting here. People here need to realize this guy has no fucking clue what he's saying at all. I looked him up and it turns out he truly only has made money in Bitcoin yet he always talks about these topics outside his realm of understanding. Even in his own essay he doesn't understand how Bitcoin fucking works. It's embarrassing having these people as your figureheads.

Hi Erik,
Great read! I just have a few questions here. Satoshi literally posted [this]( in 2009:


This directly contradicts what you said in your article:




You even bolded the line above to make sure to get your point across. A point that is directly refuted by who you claim to be speaking for. It is almost as if all you read was his whitepaper and nothing else.
Also, as I read more, it appears that you completely missed the point of his article. He never claimed that that the IDEA of Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme. He was merely stating it is being operated like one. I found he describes the way it is operating quite well actually. 
People buy and hold, they ask others to come aboard and buy more. They spend their time tipping hoping people will hop on the trolley and purchase more Bitcoins, etc. All of this causes a rising price. People tell others to "hodl" so the price does not crash. If it were to be used as a successful currency, mechanisms would be in place to control the rising price to keep it stable so others could reliably store value in it. 


Also, please take this line out. It's utter horseshit and you know it. From a libertarian, you should know this is just not true at all. Decentralized systems will ALWAYS be more expensive but they bring the freedom of the system along with it. Bitcoin is absolutely insanely inefficient in what it does. It uses an absurd amount of electricity and miner subsidies to run the system right now. It's simple math and I hate when pro-bitcoiners spread these bullshit lies. It makes us look like complete con men.
Most of your article is long winded nothingness that doesn't actually directly refute anything he says. Your entire introduction is basically saying "Bitcoin is absolutely terrible for a store of wealth but it's super cheap (it's actually incredibly expensive) but I like it so therefore, it's the most important technology ever!" I mean, come on man. Come back down to planet Earth. You even contradict yourself in your own intro. You say North claims it will never be money, then you basically agree with him that he's not the target audience implying that basically a small percentage of people actually ARE the target audience. 
And for god's sake Erik, something being a scarce resource does not make it valuable. I remember around November or so of 2013, someone asked you what would happen if the world used Bitcoin and your response was something along the lines of "everyone gets richer". Thankfully, you were downvoted because every time I read your shit I feel like you have absolutely no fucking idea what you're talking about. I don't even know how you came to prominence but it certainly wasn't through anything BUT Bitcoin.
The ONLY reason, and I mean the ONLY reason I am interested in it is absolute freedom to spend my money HOWEVER I want, WHENEVER I want. Typing up these bullshit articles, ESPECIALLY when the price is crashing to cheer us on and to ALSO get us to hodl (ironically) is patronizing. Your article should have just said "Bitcoin is freedom to spend your money however you'd like with 0 intervention. Bitcoin is a protocol in which it's price can climb or sky dive depending on demand. In the end, it's a choice and a risk you must take to free yourself from the current financial system. Any other scams, pumps, or dumps are the riskiness and result of freedom and not everyone should take part". It may not be perfectly written but that's basically the only honest thing I can say about Bitcoin at the moment.
Edit: BTW, as I submitted this there must have been a margin call that dropped the price down to ~$165. Speculation causes these wild swings, not "fundamentals"

Again, his lawyer chose not to refute these claims because they were obviously him. It is not up to the judge during sentencing to decide mistakes made on the defense's part. It was either obviously him or the defense was so incompetent they completely blew something so incredibly easy. I wonder which it is.
@_date: 2016-11-30 23:17:59
Why does the article say 2014-2015 but the document says 2013. Did they reach a different settlement?
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:51:00
I thought this post was satire. I haven't been on in 3 years and just dropped in to see what's going on. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 01:33:32
Is 2013 ever going to be affected by any future rulings since they met in the middle for 2014 and 2015?
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:49:19
This is what I don't understand. Tons of articles are saying it's 2014-2015 but the order clearly says Jan 1st, 2013. I don't know where those other articles are getting this info from.
@_date: 2016-12-01 23:56:40
Oh it was bad 3 years ago which is why I left. The posts are exactly the same. 6 month out predictions about how high it's going to go. The front page has had no changes in years. It's bizarre.
@_date: 2016-11-30 23:58:05
Would this be permanent then? They won't bother with 2013 records unless someone from those years pops as tax fraud?
@_date: 2015-04-05 07:52:50
You have a severe misunderstanding of population density. This isn't fucking South Dakota.
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:15:19
It's also hilariously ironic. What causes it to go up? People not wanting to spend it and hold on to it. Remove all three carts from the Bitcoin section and have empty spaces instead and it will make more sense.
@_date: 2015-04-10 03:36:45
Honest question...I send free transfers in the thousands of dollars with BOA. Why do you have to go into the bank? I haven't been in a bank in ten years
@_date: 2015-04-05 07:12:36
I think this illustrates how no one gives a fucking SHIT about anything about Bitcoin except this sub. Nobody fucking cares.

ITT: Every single one of you falling for the 1% fallacy hook, line, and sinker. This is why this subreddit is seen as a group of idiots jerking each other off.
