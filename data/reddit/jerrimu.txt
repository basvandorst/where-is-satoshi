   Yeah I don't think he was, but I think he either wrote the whitepaper for Nakomoto, or revised it.  It was tested by someone (Newsweek iirc?) and his writing was found to be very similar.  
  That and his super mega-early involvement push me that way.

  OK,  maybe you aren't trolling. 
 TPTB are split on this I think, we see plenty of billionaires that are into crypto and hyping it, we also know that if it ends up working out, it will  destroy a lot of the financial industry. 
 
   So division in the global elite leads to a stalemate for the time being. 
 
  I am not 100% sure that cryptocurrency is here to stay, but blockchain tech is, and in a big way. Things will decentralize heavily, and eventually become uncontrollable. I can't even say if that is a good or bad thing at present, no idea how humanity is gonna handle all that freedom.  We might be the guy that gets out of jail and gets a degree, starts a family and dies happy. We also might be the guy that gets out and immediately commits a crime because it's all we know.
 This is all speculation of course.

  Your argument was that it was a scam I was trying to point out that our entire economic culture depends on using tokens with no inherent wealth.   The world will know what crypto is I believe that firmly. Bitcoin isn't scaling well, the fees are high, but it isn't the only option. There isn't any fraud, it just has problems. 
 
 Well no more fraud than the government printing money at will with nothing to back it up.

The API hint as well
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:34:39
  Jerry's Deductive Explanation. 
 
  So, few days ago either a dev or a CB employee leaked a screen of BCH in the coinbase API.   Either the people that saw it, or crooked employees started buying pretty hard.    
 
   I believe CB rushed the launch to counter the leak &amp; stop insider buying, just my opinion.   
 
  So, BCH hits CB with NO REAL WARNING, everyone goes fucking insane, just buying like crazy. Pushes the price up to close to .5 btc.  CB gets worried and shuts down trading. Approx 1k transactions between 4500 and 8500 make it through before the freeze. 
 
   Transaction fees for BTC spike that day, and media picks up on it. So now you have the "BCH is the OG bitcoin crowd" hyped AF cause BCH goes way up. Then you have stories in the media about the issues BTC is having. 
 
  People start selling, this sets off a panic wave/cashout wave. Which leads to more panic selling. As it stands, it's pretty obvious that BTC determines the market, and since it was plummeting, everything did. The people that were scared sold, hodlers bought and it stabilized and started going back up. 
 
 
The End.

   So are BTC and BCH.  Personally I like the cryptonight algo, Monero is def leading the pack. Only time will tell though.  
 
  I really agree with Satoshi's vision, and as it stands I think that will take a coin that isn't asic mineable, and privacy features are a huge plus.

If my screen was plugged in, it's a trade I'd make. I have pretty severe ADHD though, so maybe I'm an exception to the rule.

I feel good about monero, eth, and ripple, but I'm totally new to this, your thoughts on those?

 Doesn't have to be much higher at all, I'm not talking about a significant cpu tax or anything here.  The added cost would probably be noticed some on mobile devices die to more frequent charging, but a long as it was a trivial amount per device, I think people would be all on board.

  If you know it's happening and willingly make the exchange, it isn't malware at all.

  Yeah, I'm not suggesting a scam or scheme. Having 5-25% of one core while active would probably be enough to have the income scale with app usage fairly well. Well, as long as the application was something that ran for a decent amount of time.

It's fairly well known this acct has been compromised. On that account a warning was posted to the actual Satoshi in 2014.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:17:42
So, yeah still a no-go.

Don't understand?  
 
Would you say you're L O S T?

one is 100,000,000 more than the other

Same, Dorian &amp; Hal for sure. Probably Dave Kleinman, Szabo, and maybe Wei Dai.

Good catch! You may have been the first person to notice.
