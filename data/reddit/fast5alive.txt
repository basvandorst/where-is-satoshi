1. 
2. It's honestly not worth the money and time to mine for hobbyists, at this point. Learning about mining is a good lesson for bitcoin enthusiasts but isn't essential to understand the concept of bitcoin.
3. Those who operate mining farms are doing so for the incentive of block rewards, ie. being paid in bitcoin and profiting from it. Oftentimes they need price to go up to make a profit/break even, or sell their rewards to maintain overhead. They are doing something productive by contributing to the bitcoin network and adding security to it.
4. One particular "flaw" that's grabbing all the attention right now is the ongoing (raging) block size debate. Right now since blocks have a max size limit of 1MB, a limit designated in the early days to prevent DOS attacks, the devs are in disagreement on when and how to raise this limit, as it may limit the number of transactions at any given time. This is an issue on the scalability of bitcoin as mainstream adoption progresses. There is traditionally a unanimous consensus needed to implement code such as this, that may require a hard fork in the blockchain. Anyway, this is how problems are discussed/resolved. 
5. Coins can be lost if the wallets are deleted and private keys are forgotten. In your hypothetical situation, the remaining 50%'s value would go up. But also remember that bitcoin can be divided into 8 decimal places and the concept of "one" bitcoin right now is based on the 1/21 million limit. As I understand it, more decimal places can be added if necessary.

Circle gives you an amount of instant coins like coinbase. The limit would be the limit they put for your credit card. For bank withdrawals, they give you a partial amount until funds are withdrawn from your bank account.
Exchanges are instant but not if you factor in the time spent wiring money to them in the first place.
I've never tried LocalBitcoins but they are instant.

It's good. Some suggestions if you're planning to edit it. Just my two cents. Make scalability header and tps description larger as it's important. Remove Cash and the question marks altogether and leave Visa, Paypal and Bitcoin.
Make two columns for Pros/Cons on right side to make it clearer what is a pro and con. Do not color code it unless you put in a legend, as it's not intuitive.
This may benefit from a second page on the current proposals on the table also, with pros and cons?

I was excited about Trezor but was confused that it used a web interface and you needed to be online to use it. I understand that you can use other wallets to recover your device if MyTrezor goes down (which it has) but what if the site itself becomes compromised? Is that a single point of failure for all devices? I also recall their attempt to remove their code from the public because of Chinese imitations.. so I wanted to be sure their code was reviewed by experts. Only thing I could find was endorsements for the device before it was released, good reviews for the product itself, but nothing about the safety of the code. I mean, the creators are trustworthy names but who knows who's trying to hack this device, right?

Blythe is covering her bases by acquiring HL but in the long run, I don't see how this will outweigh trustworthiness based on some honor system that Digital Assets is swearing by and how other financial institutions will agree to all use this centralized ledger, though private, is still public to a single entity

They cancelled every purchase I made. Each purchase takes 3-4 business days to process. When you try 6 times in a row it's easy to forget if your balance falls behind a little.

like many bitcoiners this one gets overexcited and starts speeding up, glossing over the technicals and losing the audience in the process. keep it simple, stupid. there's no need to mention what goes on behind the scenes. the presenter also needs to work on his segues. he mentions new terms like public ledger, double spends, "authoritative", transactional history all within 10 seconds without defining any of them or why they're important. better luck next time. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 22:40:51
It is because of MtGox but not because of the supposed 'Willy bot' which most people theorize or suspect. The crash and fraud of Mt. Gox created an aversion towards bitcoin for new buyers. Now it's become harder for institutional investors to actually buy the large amounts of bitcoin that they want because the options to buy with USD are so limited. We'll have to wait until Second Market's BIT, the Winklevoss ETF or a good US exchange goes public for Wall Street investors to pour their money into. It looks like this will happen as early as 2015, hopefully.

thanks for this. I've been raving about this for weeks on irc and seeing that people have come to this conclusion independently is satisfying, even if it's just as a confirmation. if you watch a mtgox ticker side by side with Huobi, you can clearly see that gox moves price when someone buys/sells big. why would an exchange with 10x the volume even care about that? it's been quite obvious for the past 3 weeks and I know this won't last.

There should be two factor addresses in order to prevent this from happening, actually. The client can create multiple addresses for the same wallet, yes? Have it create two addresses, have the sender enter in two addresses, and if they don't match, have the sending client not send to the wrong recipient. Easy. Has anyone thought of this yet?

as I've said before. can the dev team implement 2FA for sending/receiving, which would simply require two valid matching addresses to be generated by the recipient and for those two addresses to be input by the sender, therefore validating that the recipient is the correct one?

They're very good at cancelling your transactions for no reason if the price doesn't move in their favor though, and buying from them could waste time, up to 2-3 business days depending on which day of the week you initiate the purchase.

@_date: 2014-06-09 16:34:33
Yeah, coinbase is a horrible place to buy coins. They simply cannot cater to the bitcoin buyer, so you end up wasting time waiting for approval on a purchase rather than wiring those same funds to a *reliable* exchange. Don't waste your time with coinbase anymore. It's a crap shoot and not the way such a service should operate. They should stick to their little Budweiser promotional campaigns since they're looking to sell out to the biggest buyer eventually anyway. I would go to Bitfinex. Stamp has harsh AML/KYC policies but if you're ok with that, they are very reliable as well. I've heard things about Kraken but their orderbook is very thin. But that all depends on how many coins you want to buy.

That's a good point and I'd agree with the arbitrage if someone would be able to explain how that would work. You would have to fund your Huobi account if it is possible for non-Chinese citizens to be verified without having a Chinese bank account. Also, it is correct that Gox prices are higher than Huobi's. So you can sell on gox only to hit a brick wall with the withdrawal issues there. Also, that leads to another question of why does Gox follow Huobi's price when Huobi's price is lower in USD? It should be lower as Stamp and btce's is to Gox's.

yeah they'll make you wait 5 business days before cancelling your transaction citing the fact that it's a 'high-risk transaction'. High-risk means the price has gone up since you bought, ie. purchased at $300 and the price has gone up to $325. Meanwhile, your funds have been held in your bank account for the moment they decide to withdraw. They won't cancel your transaction if the reverse happens (price goes down).
They will also cancel your transactions for no reason at all. Do yourself a favor and search for 'coinbase' in to see how many complaints there are with their practices and total lack of customer service.

I've worked with EC2 (AWS) servers steadily for the past 4 years. Do you know how many times we've been given access to someone else's server because they mixed up EIP's (elastic IP addresses that are reused) or the system did not properly wipe temp instances? We've had many tickets on this issue in the past but since it wasn't ultra sensitive data, we never thought much of it. 
The people who say that AWS is "super secure" also don't realize how often regional outages occur, it seems.

You let moderators remove opinions that go against their way of thinking? Read below.
from Taylorvongrela[M] via sent 31 minutes ago Hi, I removed your post because it isn't appropriate for it's own post in this sub. Please post it as a comment in the daily discussion. As an aside, your question is going to get you downvoted insanely because you're basically implying that there's no good reason for the spread between Gox and Stamp. Are you really asking this or are you trying to troll?
from Taylorvongrela[M] via sent 9 minutes ago show parent Ok, well please take a few minutes to read this subreddit's rules and guidelines. After looking at your prior comments it's clear that you've come over from Please understand that we are far more strict here in about what is acceptable and unacceptable to post here, but that is all covered in our Expanded Posting Guidelines (which can always be found near the top of the page). The daily discussion is a stickied thread that is posted up at midnight every day (and on very volatile days we will do 2 daily posts, one in the morning and one in the evening). Our sub uses the daily discussion thread to talk about things that are happening right now, such as your question from above. It could turn out that tomorrow the spread between exchanges has closed significantly, and your post would be obsolete at that point. Things like that which are dealing with a here and now issue, they belong in the daily discussion thread. Larger questions that aren't necessarily time related, or serious market analysis are the types of things that merit their own posts here. And in regards to your original question, BitStamp will not be closing the gap with MtGox. There are many good reasons why Gox is trading at $255 and BitStamp is at $625, but the main reason is that confidence in Gox's abilities as an exchange has pretty much collapsed in the wake of the transactional malleability issues they suffered last week. Their suspension of BTC withdrawals, subsequent blaming of the Bitcoin protocol instead of their own internal protocol, and slow response to reopen BTC withdrawals have all prompted the market to react in the way that it has. BitStamp will not be going down in price to meet MtGox. In all likelihood, Gox will reenable BTC withdrawals, and Gox's price will rise to catch up with BitStamp (and likely surpass BitStamp/BTC-e because users still can't withdraw USD from Gox, so people will be buying BTC to move it out of gox, but very few will be selling to convert to fiat.)

this is not FUD. I support bitcoin all the way. what I don't support are shady exchanges who magically lose funds and cause unnecessary price drops like today to happen. 
As a community, we should be demanding answers from parties responsible for the health and growth of bitcoin instead of turning a blind eye to them as you are suggesting. In no other community/platform can you do something like this. If not on reddit, then it won't happen, and the system will continue to be abused. We'd all love explanations from Target/Chase but it's not going to happen, right? We need to ask these kinds of questions so that people are held accountable and they never happen again.

LOL I love how these guys are saying "here's a simpler explanation!" and then proceed to write 10 paragraphs of explanation. 
the way to understand mining is to use an analogy with password cracking. when you run a cracker to "brute force" your way into solving or hacking someone's password by trying every possible combination, you are essentially doing what mining hardware and the software does also. within the bitcoin algorithm was a jumble of hashes or combinations that were designated but unknown to anyone but the randomness of the algorithm. so what miners are doing are cracking these combinations and earning coins. 
of course it gets more technical than this. they also pass along every bitcoin transaction by supporting the network. but at the same time they are solving and earning coins.

As Greece descends into financial crisis, its citizens and investors globally are turning to hedges old and new.
 
European demand for the age-old safe haven of gold coins has risen in recent weeks, as has the relatively new concept of investments in digital bitcoins, market participants say.
 
As the situation in Europe grows more precarious, the price of both have risen in recent weeks as concerns have grown about the threat to banks in Greece and the risk that turmoil could spread to other countries in the eurozone and elsewhere.
 
After rising early Monday, the price of gold has fallen back, but there have been clear signs through June that Greek citizens have been trying to get their hands on it.
 
The U.K’s Royal Mint said Tuesday that June saw “twice the expected demand for sovereign bullion coins from our customers based in Greece.”
 
The price of bitcoin has been steadily rising over the same period. As fears of a Greek exit from the eurozone have grown, the virtual currency has broken out of a rare, three-month period of relative stability. Tuesday afternoon, it traded at $261.24, according to news service Coindesk, its highest level since March 23. In June, its price registered a 13.4% gain.
 
Bitcoin is a digital currency that is issued by a software program that resides on a network of bitcoin “mining” computers—computers that are also responsible for jointly maintaining a record of users’ balances. It isn’t controlled by a sovereign government or subject to manipulation by banks or other financial institutions, so although it has a history of volatility its proponents tout it as a store of value that can protect the holder from political risks.
 
Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of bitcoin exchange and consumer service provider Coinbase, said that “in the last 48 hours” as the crisis worsened following the breakdown of bailout talks between the Greek government and its creditors, his company’s exchange service has seen a “300% uptick in Europe.” To make things easier for European clients, the company opportunistically announced on its blog that it would charge zero fees for bitcoin purchases with euros.
 
Last week, Mr. Ehrsam said it saw 35% more activity from Greek addresses “from a very low base.” The move may have been higher, but with Greek banks closed, accessing the euros with which to buy bitcoins is difficult.
 
Most of the move was from “Europeans, especially those in the periphery countries whose abilities to finance their governments are dependent on help, [who] are starting to take notice of what can happen to the money you thought you had in your bank account.”
 
The events in Greece even seem to be triggering demand in the U.S. for physical gold—although apparently not for gold futures—as well as for bitcoin.
 
Terry Hanlon, president of Dillon Gage Metals, a wholesale precious metals trader in Dallas, said he had seen volumes grow by 70% in June from May. That wasn’t reflected in the price, he said, because that tends to be dictated by futures speculation, which doesn’t move in sync with trades of physical gold.
 
Retail investors who buy coins and bullion have been influenced, Mr. Hanlon said, by the images of bank lines in Athens far more than by concerns about monetary policy in the U.S. over the past few years.
 
“It’s a lot easier to relate to the idea that you could be standing in line and then hear your bank say it is closed and, sorry, you’re not going to get your money,” Mr. Hanlon said.

it's the online wallet that blockchain.info provides on their site. they were being "hacked" frequently before, sometimes even for 2FA users. it's a brain dead move to store any coins in online storage for an extended period of time, probably out of laziness or time constraints I imagine

whether they use bitcoin or wowcoin, as long as it's decentralized and has its own miners, the implications would be enormous. having their own in-game economy might even change their platform and mmorpg's in general, entirely 
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:25:33
if you found the wallet.dat file and you can indeed send a very small amount to yourself without being prompted for a password, you have an unencrypted wallet. This is good because you have full access to those bitcoins now but is also a security risk. after you've confirmed you now have those coins, make sure to encrypt the wallet with a passcode that only you know and make sure it's a secure password or better yet, a passphrase. then after and only after encrypting the wallet, make a backup of it to somewhere safe, preferably multiple offline storage locations. then make sure you remove or otherwise make your online wallet.dat that holds those coins inaccessible. I might delete the file completely once you have the backups. then read up on other cold storage alternatives like Trezor or paper wallets. don't keep them all in one wallet.

yeah, my general idea is for wallets to agree on one sound in order to make bitcoin more recognizable, ie. the Super Mario coin sound effect, therefore easing along with adoption and mainstream acceptance. That one sound effect is immediately recognized by many today, and I can picture the same for bitcoin in the future
