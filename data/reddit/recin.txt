January is just a slow month for crypto. Look back every year for 4 years and you will see the same pattern. Are you saying that the big financial institutions are manipulating the market every year, but just in January to make it look normal?
I'm not saying it's not possible, just that it's unlikely and that the far more reasonable explanation is that this is just a normal January lull caused by low volume and very little new money flowing in.
Edit: To add to this, if institutional investors are keeping the price down it makes sense that they would be trying to buy it while it's low, correct? If that's true, where's the volume at? Wouldn't they be buying up more if they were trying to manipulate it to make a ton of money?

Or you know, it could be the same exact January dip that happens every year

COSS at Coss.io. It's still in beta, but they have a new UI launch and an engine update scheduled soon. They pay out 50% of trading fees to token holders ever week and that's guaranteed by a smart contract so they can never lower the fee split.

If youre in the US there most certainly is tax liability for trading cryptocurrencies. Please dont spread misinformation that could ruin peoples lives down the road.

Idk man, you came off pretty fucking bitter to me as an impartial observer.

We need a tinfoil hat post flair for all the silly conspiracy theories that people post.

Try reading before calling somebody a scammer. Its very obvious that you didnt comprehend anything he said.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:05:17
I dont know if you are new, a troll or just dont understand the lingo, but in a cryptocurrency related sub the term "crypto" refers to a cryptocurrency, not cryptography.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:59:00
Of course you don't, conspiracy theorists never do.

I'm pretty sure he means the first new coin since they made the announcement that they were adding new coins in 2018. Don't get all offended.

If youre mining with cpu/gpu, you wont make anything mining btc. Youre much better off mining something without asics like monero ot eth and converting it to to btc if you dont want to hold what you are mining.

You can still google crypto information, there just wont be a million unsolicited add for scam cryptos anywhere anymore.
Also, i dont have to see that butcoin genius' super punchable face all over the place anymore.

Its a privately owned company, they can do whatever the fuck they want.
That being said, i think this is in relation to the double charge issue they are having.

Nope, I need somewhere to point my pitchfork.

Apparently some people cant take a joke.

Oh, that's pretty cool. I've never used it, but I've done a little pool mining on my own just for fun and to learn more about PoW.

Technically its a chart, but otherwise i agree.

What is this "search function" you speak of?

What a jackass.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:25:43
Yeah, theres about 30 threads all over crypto subs about it. Also the coinbase sub is a dumpster fire right now.

R/gatekeeping at its finest.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:16:16
It makes sense anyway. Instead of trying to educate somebody, you acted like an entitled prick and assumed he's going to be on welfare for decades after reading 2 sentences on Reddit. How does that not make you a jackass?
We should be trying to educate people about crypto, not making fun of them.

Just from a 3 second google search i found that VMWare uses port 8333.

Because the millions of people haven't made anything because they haven't sold. They have unrealized gains, which is a very different thing.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:26:56
The two aren't mutually exclusive.

I don't think it's worth mining BTC with a graphics card. You'd probably be much better off mining something that is ASIC resistant like Monero.
You can use whattomine.com to get an idea of how much profit a given coin will give you with your hashing power.

Im not saying its right, but they dont answer to any shareholders or anything. 
OP was acting like they are breaking a law or something.

Not at all unless you plan to hold until crypto becomes the de facto currency. But if we're talking in terms of fiat, there is definitely a difference.
