**Other risks**
Anonymity is not the only risk associated with digital currencies.
*"The anonymity piece, that obfuscation of ownership, gets further complicated when the funds move across international borders and the value transfer is between asset classes,"* says Hamish Thomas.
In the case of Liberty Reserve, law enforcement actions took place across 17 countries. However, while the borderless nature of digital currencies does make the issue more complex, Borenstein says regulators are well-equipped to deal with the risk.
*"Money-laundering investigations have traditionally been cross-border investigations. It's not been unusual to see money-laundering investigations that have been across three, or five, or eight countries, so the good news is the regulators and law enforcement are used to this,"* he says.
Financial institutions, meanwhile, can be affected by the risks digital currencies pose in various ways. Industry experts warn, for instance, that they need to carry out a proactive vetting of which digital currency exchanges they will work with.
*"In the past decade, numerous digital currency exchanges, such as Ozzi Gold, The Bullion Exchange, and most recently Liberty Reserve, have been closed by regulators,"* says Borenstein. Others have opted to adopt relevant anti-money laundering and currency movement regulatory requirements in order to be accepted as transparent and legal business entities.
*"Financial institutions should be familiar with this history and keep abreast of changes in these various entities, while also consulting with local regulatory agencies and peer groups,"* says Borenstein. US firms need to determine if the organisation is registered as a Money Services Business (MSB), as required by FinCen.
Murck says banks are already becoming more cautious about digital currency exchanges following the Liberty Reserve case.* "You're seeing banks now start to issue blanket policies that they won't deal with any digital currency providers,"* he says.
Financial institutions also need to monitor the activities of their customers in relation to digital currencies. *"If their customers start to do a lot of business involving virtual currency, banks will need to build virtual currency more firmly into their risk modelling,"* says Hamish Thomas.
Banks will need to know what types of payments their corporate clients are accepting. If financial institutions have clients that accept digital currencies, then they will typically need to ensure those clients have robust KYC mitigation mechanisms and measures in place, depending on their jurisdiction.
*"If the financial institution is not confident of this, then the institution would probably want to reconfirm the status and legality of digital currencies with the client,"* says Borenstein.
Financial institutions may incur risk if legitimate accounts are used to buy such currencies as part of participation in an online game, online gambling, or other activity. *"Financial institutions might also be exposed if credit cards are used to purchase such digital monies in a manner that shields the currency provider's identity [by making them appear] as a ‘regular' merchant,"* he adds.
Banks might also be exposed to risk if laundered funds that either originated as a digital currency or were transferred from a digital currency are deposited with them.
The best practice for financial institutions to deal with potential risks is to conduct an ongoing awareness campaign. This includes tracking changes in local regulations and identifying illicit digital currency providers masquerading as high-risk merchants. Borenstein says banks should also share experiences with peer groups and learn from law enforcement actions and how legitimate digital currency providers have changed their ways.
One potential barrier for banks in the fight against money laundering with digital currencies is the scale of transactions going through the world's financial systems. Jason Thomas, however, says this is an issue that can be managed.
*"Money laundering can be combatted through large-scale computer systems that comb through data,"* he says. *"We have to readjust as we look at digital currencies because there are some complexities there that aren't represented in normal financial transactions."* He adds it is a question of how much money and time financial institutions are willing to spend on the issue.
Financial institutions, however, are not the sole players when it comes to dealing with digital currencies.
*"There's no silver bullet for this; clearly banks have a role to play,"* says Hamish Thomas. *"But the reality is regulatory bodies would need to catalyse necessary action and lead from the front."*
**Actions by regulators**
Most regulatory action with regards to digital currencies has so far originated from the US, with FinCen publishing guidance in March of this year.
*"In the US there has been quite a hostile position adopted by regulators,"* says Stewart Plant, a partner who leads the litigation and regulatory group at law firm DLA Piper in Manchester. *"None of the European regulators have taken a very firm position either way on any of the potential regulation that might cover this sort of activity."*
In the EU, questions have been raised as to whether digital currencies fall under the Electronic Money Directive or the Payment Services Directive. However, the European Central Bank's paper, which examined Bitcoin as an example of a virtual currency, found it fell outside the scope of the criteria for both these two directives.
Nonetheless, it is unlikely the EU will develop tailor-made legislation for digital currencies, Plant says.
*"They may be taking a view that a combination of the payment services regulations, the electronic money regulations and the anti-money laundering regulations are probably good enough as they stand to apply to this, perhaps with tweaks rather than any wholesale regulation of this particular industry."*
In the UK, Plant says there have been regulator meetings between relevant UK regulators, such as HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), to discuss the issue.
"HMRC's latest was a letter to a prospective Bitcoin operator to say they don't consider Bitcoin as a currency and therefore there is no requirement to register with HMRC in relation to the money-laundering regulations. The big but there, however, is they say they are keeping a watching brief in relation to it, so that position may well change."
Plant adds the UK is likely to follow a similar route to the US, and that it is doubtful it will be regulation-lite. This could lead to digital money operators seeking out other jurisdictions in which to operate.
For the Bitcoin Foundation, this would be a wasted opportunity for US consumers.
*"If [the US market] is too over-regulated or too unfriendly to this industry it will move abroad and US consumers will likely be locked out,"* says Murck. *"They won't be able to get the benefits of the new technology that's being developed. As happened with online poker, the US will miss out on another multi-billion dollar industry with thousands of thousands of high-paying, high-tech jobs that will be shipped overseas."*
Recent developments, however, suggest other jurisdictions may be taking a similar stance. The Bank of Thailand, for example, banned the use of Bitcoins in the country on July 29 of this year.
Industry experts nonetheless agree digital currencies are here to stay, and that those affected across the globe need to take heed of their presence.
*"Digital currencies are literally a game-changing technology,"* says Jason Thomas. *"It may not be Bitcoin in the future, it may be some other digital currency, but the tsunami is coming and we have to come to some agreement point as to how we're going to regulate it and how we're going to use it."*
Managing the risks these currencies pose while maintaining the innovation they bring is key, according to Hamish Thomas.
*"[What's important] is striking a balance between the very healthy business and technology and innovation and the regulatory control, so one doesn't stifle or outrun the other."*

**Small but growing, electronic currencies promise privacy and anonymity for users – and plenty of new issues for banks**
Earlier this year, the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York described digital currency company Liberty Reserve as the "financial hub of the cybercrime world". On May 28, the office brought charges for money laundering against the Costa Rica-based company, which is alleged to have laundered more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds.
Founded in 2006, Liberty Reserve is believed to have had more than one million users worldwide who conducted approximately 55 million transactions, virtually all of which (the US attorney says) were illegal.
These figures reflect the proliferation of digital currencies in recent years: Bitcoin, the best-known of the digital currencies, reports transactions equivalent to $20-40 million per day. As an electronic medium of exchange which acts as an alternative currency, digital currencies do not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. But, while their use remains small, the potential risks they pose in relation to money laundering have concerned regulators and financial institutions alike. Industry experts warn, however, that the steps they take to control possible threats should not stifle innovation.
Several alternative ways of transferring value have arisen in recent years. Virtual currencies in online games, such as Linden Dollars in the online community Second Life or gold in the multiplayer game World of Warcraft, or even mobile phone minutes, have been used as alternative currencies. But digital currencies such as Bitcoin, for example, have no fixed exchange rate with conventional currency, and can be spent on both virtual and real goods. They are based on a peer-to-peer network and have no central authority in charge of money supply, nor a central clearing house.
Joram Borenstein, a vice-president within the financial crime and fraud management team at software provider Nice Actimize, emphasises that digital currencies and other alternative payment methods are still a small share of overall transactions.
A paper by the European Central Bank in October 2012 concluded that the use of virtual currencies is currently too small for them to pose significant risks. It noted, however, this assessment could change if usage increased significantly. Interest in such currencies has peaked in recent months, with the price of a Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $230 on April 9 of this year, up from just $13.51 on January 1 – a rise linked to the Cyprus banking bailout. There are now 11.5 million Bitcoins in circulation, equal to $1.2 billion at the time of writing.
*"While on the one hand you are dealing probably with billions of dollars of transactions that are flowing through these systems, in the scheme of the overall global payments network, it's probably still not dramatically significant, it's probably not even approaching 5%,"* Borenstein says.
Digital currencies offer several advantages to consumers – and Hamish Thomas, London-based director in the financial services practice at EY, formerly known as Ernst &amp; Young, welcomes them as a source of innovation.
*"Where you see the hugely interesting and exciting innovation within the industry, it's a good thing to be promoting and fostering that because it creates a degree of customer choice, it drives a degree of competition,"* he says.
Jason Thomas, a senior strategic analyst with Thomson Reuters, says he has used Bitcoins himself, and was impressed with the result. *"There are no transaction fees for one. And the speed at which it works and the convenience is incredible,"* he says.
The key attraction for many, however, is the notion of anonymity associated with digital currencies.
*"There are people who want to remain anonymous in this world, be it for a legal reason or an illegal reason,"* says Borenstein. Legal reasons can, for example, be political or personal, such as donations to political campaigns, or wishing to keep a sensitive medical examination private.
*"For some people, it's just a matter of principle,"* says Patrick Murck, general counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation in Washington DC, a non-profit organisation which represents the Bitcoin community. *"They feel like too much information is being shared about them right now and they'd prefer to control the swell of information about them."* Bitcoin puts financial privacy in the hands of consumers, who are given a greater choice as to who they transfer money with, Murck says.
However, this anonymity is proving unnerving for regulators. In the case of Liberty Reserve, users were not required to validate their identity information, such as by providing official identification documents or a credit card. Accounts could therefore be opened easily using fictitious or anonymous identities.
Industry experts warn this notion of anonymity poses risks to anti-money laundering and sanctions-checking measures, which are underpinned by know your customer (KYC) rules. Users were also required to make any deposits or withdrawals through the use of third-party exchangers. This allowed Liberty to avoid collecting any information about its users.
*"If you don't know or haven't got clarity on who the funds are flowing from and to, it creates a risk that those funds or that value flows to an undesirable place,"* says Hamish Thomas.
However, the Bitcoin Foundation argues Bitcoin differs from Liberty Reserve. The foundation recently filed comments following the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's (FinCen) decision to impose special measures against Liberty Reserve. It was concerned that statements made by FinCen could suggest that virtual currency transactions were inherently suspect.
The foundation called for FinCen to be consistent in using terms when regulating digital currencies and disagreed with the finding that irrevocable anonymous transactions serve no commercial purpose.
"We also disagreed with the blanket assertion that all private anonymous payments are inherently suspicious,"* says Murck. *"There is actually a legitimate use for private, anonymous financial transactions."*
The Bitcoin Foundation acknowledges Bitcoin is in many ways more private than traditional financial systems, but argues in other ways it is actually more open. The ledger of transactions on Bitcoin is publicly available, and anyone can obtain a copy of every transaction that has ever occurred and which address it was sent to or from. What is private, however, is who owns the address.
Murck claims Bitcoin operates differently to Liberty Reserve, which he says had set up sham systems to perform customer identification.
*"They were knowingly subverting their ability to know who was transacting on their network. It's a very different set of facts from a decentralised system where people have to actually actively maintain their privacy,"* he says.
However, the Bitcoin.org website gives details of how users can maintain their privacy on the Bitcoin network. It states the identity of an owner cannot be associated with their Bitcoin address until personal information is revealed by the owner during an exchange.
*"This is why it is recommended for Bitcoin owners to use many different Bitcoin addresses; in fact, you should create a new one each time you receive money,"* the website states. *"You might also want to consider hiding your computer's IP address with a tool like Tor so that it cannot be logged."*

The price of bitcoin isn't the only thing about the virtual currency that is going through the roof.
Mining costs, industry parlance for the investments in sophisticated technology required to create bitcoin, are soaring as companies and people race to build ever-more-powerful computers to jump into the market.
In the mining process, bitcoin enthusiasts, technology experts and fledgling firms essentially generate units of the currency by solving complicated math problems with their computers.
The growing popularity and rising prices of bitcoin are causing a mad dash for the powerful computing power needed to generate the virtual currency, leading to profit pressure for companies and individual enthusiasts working to create their own stashes.
The speed at which such operations take place is now 40 times faster than in January, according to the Genesis Block, a New York research and data firm that tracks the bitcoin industry. In addition, hardware companies are hustling to keep up with orders for new equipment.
"The dollars that have been invested in this space are being reinvested into computational power," says Greg Schvey, head of research at the company.
There is a finite supply of 21 million bitcoin that can be created. There are roughly 12 million currently in existence.
The furor surrounding bitcoin production was referenced last week in a lawsuit filed against two bitcoin companies in which a New York-based investment firm contends bitcoin startup CoinLab Inc. and its mining unit violated a bitcoin-production contract.
The suit, filed by Bitvestment Partners LLC, contends that CoinLab reneged on a pact to produce nearly 8,000 bitcoin.
The lawsuit was a contributing factor in last week's bankruptcy filing of the CoinLab mining unit, Alydian Inc.
"Due to the lawsuit and the dramatic increase in mining speed in the Bitcoin network (lowering returns for all Bitcoin miners, including Alydian), Alydian felt that its duty was to ensure that Alydian's customers, creditors and investors maximize their possible returns through Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection," Peter Vessenes, CoinLab's chief executive, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. He said the lawsuit was baseless.
A lawyer representing Bitvestment declined to comment on Mr. Vessenes's statement. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. district court for the New York's Southern district.
The lawsuit and bankruptcy are the latest scramble around bitcoin, a fast-growing virtual currency that has seen roller-coaster trading and fueled a modern-day gold rush.
Bitcoin's increased popularity also has brought more scrutiny. A pair of Senate committees will hold hearings on the policy issues raised by virtual currencies in the coming weeks, according to Senate aides, a development that comes amid growing attention from government regulators on digital forms of money.
Bitcoin is a four-year-old virtual currency that isn't backed by a central bank and can be traded on a number of exchanges or swapped privately. A growing number of merchants also accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services, because the transaction costs associated with the currency are generally cheaper than those with credit cards or debit cards.
Bitcoin traded at record highs Tuesday, rising to $252.61 on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange. That gives those 8,000 disputed bitcoin a value of roughly $2 million.
But the rising prices have brought an increased push by so-called miners to use the speediest computers to get more bitcoin.
"There is an arms race for customized hardware that is more and more powerful and can process transactions faster and faster. But it is making it difficult to get a return on investment," says Jeremy Allaire, a technology entrepreneur who last week announced a new bitcoin-related company that received $9 million in venture-capital funding.
The power and speed at which the computers attempt to solve the problems and accumulate more bitcoin is measured in the so-called hashrate. Recently, the measure has soared and is now tracked in "petahash," bitcoin experts say.
Alydian's bankruptcy filing surprised many observers, because CoinLab is one of the best-known names in the virtual-currency industry, describing itself as a "bitcoin business incubator." Silicon Valley's venture-capital firm Draper Associates pumped $500,000 into CoinLab last year.
Mr. Vessenes also is the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit trade group that promotes the use of bitcoin.
The process of producing bitcoin is being further complicated by arrangements in which some mining companies essentially agreed to sell bitcoin to investors in exchange for cash to fund equipment needs, according to people who track the industry. With bitcoin prices rising, it is now more expensive for the miners to deliver that currency to their investors.
"Mining has gotten hypercompetitive very quickly," says Alex Ferrara, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, who is assessing investment opportunities in the bitcoin industry.
