A JavaScript crypto miner running for 10 seconds isn’t going to damage shit. On a modern computer it isn’t even noticeable unless you check CPU processes. There just isn’t anything to sue over.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:34:00
You can not sue for this. It could be loosely in there TOS. Even if it’s not, it causes no damage to you or your property. You would not have a case.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:39:59
Trespass of what? Damages don’t even add up to $1, not even a cent.
@_date: 2015-06-21 00:09:51
Not an issue. Technology will catch up to the storage and internet speeds needed for the block size.

Is overstock just as good as Amazon. I have Amazon Prime and love the 2 day shipping. Does Overstock have something equal to prime?

Its pointless. The Pi isn't powerful enough to make any meaningful contribution. 
Its far too slow. :/

I like this. It shows how well Bitcoin runs. Even with a mempool attack like this, normal legit transactions still go through. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:58:21
Op, you are really being a dick. Is it really that hard to ask nicely?
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:33:55
What a trash news title. It's pure clickbait. This only applies at Smith's- Kroger owns Smith's. Kroger stores are still accept Visa.

This guys post made my head hurt.
@_date: 2019-03-16 05:35:34
It clearly says 2/100 on it....
Just saw your other post.

This is why people commit suicide over bitcoin. Don't do that to yourself. By all means invest in bitcoin, but don't put all of your money into it. Thats insane.
@_date: 2016-12-28 03:21:05
I hate people who ask this question. If you are using Bitcoin for the right reason and not trying to make a quick buck. It's ALWAYS a good time to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:11:40
This is great. PayPal is not new money. I always hated that commercial.
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:09:55
You are obviously missing OP's point then.
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:00:46
$900 and still climbing fast. When I wake up tomorrow I want it at at least $950.
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:34:47
So Circle is just a simpler PayPal now. I had to convert my account to USD just to cash out my Bitcoins. Now I can't even use Circle to store my bitcoins anymore. This blows.
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:15:58
They all work the same. I went with KeepKey. I like the design of it the best.
@_date: 2016-12-30 14:33:10
Already done. Verified on Bitnode. :)
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:21:59
Panic selling and buying will ruin BTC.
@_date: 2016-12-29 17:55:11
This is the senders fault. Not a high enough miner fee.
@_date: 2016-12-27 01:19:31
He is spot on. This is why Bitcoin is kinda like gold and silver. Governments simply can't make more of it and it is in limited supply, so it is harder to dilute its worth. It's worth comes from how much people are willing to pay for it. Now only if these didn't fluctuate in price so much. I think the main issue is with the media, all of these bitcoin breaches and news of it being illegal in some countries really scares people and makes them sell it and not want to buy it.

Borderline I read it as “bitch in a bar”.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:24:50
Yeah, checking the weather at a glance is pretty cool.
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:52:19
I got this same exact email yesterday! 
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:08:32
Oh wow. A $300 Raspberry Pi. What will they come out with next?
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:03:40
A few are. My bank has no minimum. I could keep 1 dollar in and not get charged a cent.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:30:46
Looks like all of the BTC has been removed from the wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:36:33
The private key has always worked with those wallets. I have made about 25 wallets and every private key worked. I'm not worried about it.
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:47:00
Ok yeah. You are paying like $250 for software. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:26:09
That is the most awesome idea I have seen yet! :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:55:48
Your bank just really sucks. I have a debt/atm card at my bank and they don't charge me anything. I can even use an out of network ATM and they refund me all of there charges at the end of each month.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:48:24
I did not see that! I will be printing some those too then. :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:55:05
Try coinbase! All you need to verify is a bank account.
EDIT: My mistake.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:28:09
I would never give this to someone as a gift who doesn't know what Bitcoin is. It would just look like a strip of paper to someone who didn't know. 
Then again... it would spread knowledge about BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:05:09
That is exactly what I am doing. I'm giving this on top of the normal gift I would give. :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:37:16
Yup. It even says that you should sweep the balance and not leave anything on the paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:17:48
Happy cake day, have some karma.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:03:27
Sure, whatever makes you feel good about yourself.

There are color laser jet printers and laser jets are more water resistant. Water would smear the ink from a regular printer.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:50:17
Each one takes about 5 minutes to make.
I printed them out here: 
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:27:33
Thanks for the tip. I will write that on the back of each paper wallet that I give away.
