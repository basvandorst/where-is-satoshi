Do not worry - if there's ONLY a transfer ID then it hasn't happened yet.
Once it has happened you will have a transfer ID (useless) AND a Transaction Hash on GDAX

Lost 7 BTC to a friend using my phone while I slept. Could never prove it but he was the only one in my house at the time. It was during the dip down to about $400/BTC so it wasn't hard to get over the monetary loss, but the betrayal still stings.
All hardware wallets since then - safely hidden and locked away.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:10:47
His point is that they would wait to place the shorts before selling my dude.

Yeah, I've done it before with a BTC transaction where they never paid. Just google it, I don't remember how I did it. You have to dispute it or something and if they do not respond you can cancel it.

It still has two major effects. The first is that those private investors may have purchased coins off of an exchange had they not been given this opportunity. The second is that the exchanges may have already baked in the SR Coins, and can now adjust upward with them being dealt to private parties. It could go either way, and there are probably many more things I didn't even consider.

From what I've heard you should have done something a few months ago and now it's too late. Please keep in mind that my brain could by lying to me and I'm not close enough to the situation to tell you what you can and cannot do. Whatever you need to do though, you should probably not be posting on reddit for advice. Speak to a lawyer or something I would guess...

E-Bay, PayPal, and Google Wallet are **literally** the worst ways to sell Bitcoin online. You will have a chargeback done at least 3 out of 10 times. And E-Bay/PayPal will not care because the account was 'compromised' - aka they used tor to shield their real location.

It cannot be reverse engineered from half of the code. You can do this, but keep in mind that you yourself need to know both halves still if one of them is stolen or lost.

Of course it's double speak to go viral or whatever, but just understand the purpose and don't overvalue the tweet.

Not even.
We use the same encryption level for banks and well...basically everything. If it's broken were more fucked than cryptos going down.
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:52:04
A+ trolling right here
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:30:23
Also consider that we can roll up encryption on crypto via a fork. It's really just a bunch of nonsense but hey...I love buying cheap!

There's nothing you can do other than contact the betting site who will most likely ignore your request.
Bitcoin transactions are irreversible so the funds are gone.

The relative value of one BTC is not significant because there are only a set amount of BTC in the market ever. If you believe more people will adopt BTC then it's value will continue to grow. If you believe it will fail then it's  value will fall.
