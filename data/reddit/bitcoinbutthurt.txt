All of this advice is terrible.
First, go to  In the first column select cash deposit at major bank brance. In the second column select bitcoin address. (if you don't already have a bitcoin address go to  and set one up, copy the address into the first form field at bitinstant).
Second, fill in all of the information on bitinstant, $20 in your case, and setup a fake mail address at mailinator.com, confirm the transaction. This will take you to a new page with confirmation information. Click the button in the middle to go to the next step and select the Chase branch you want to use.
Third, the button you clicked will take you to a new sit called Trustcash. Put in your zip code and it will tell you what banks are close enough for you to deposit money. They will give you an EXACT amount that you must deposit in said branch and an account number. Have them email you this information and keep it for the next step.
Fourth, go to the branch with the EXACT amount (Trustcash adds a $1 and cents as a fee) including the cents and tell the teller you want to make a deposit. They won't ask for your name, all they need is account number and account name, which Trustcash provided you with. They'll deposit the money.
Fifth, wait. Within an hour the bitcoins will be sent to your address that you created on blockchain.info.
Follow these steps and you'll your first BTC in no time.
If you found this information helpful consider tipping me.
