Thanks for your answers guys

Yeah shit is about to get a lot more complex. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:49:45
I probably wouldn’t bother given the scenario mate. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:07:33
Consider how we treated housing.
Houses are a consumable. They became known as a way to store value, and over time make money. Bitcoin is a way of exchanging value, a currency. Now, people are trying to treat it like an investment or a way to store value. 
Ask the Dutch if tulips utility was as a store of value...
Maybe we disagree on the definition utility. I agree that it is being used, but not for the reasons that make BTC valuable.

Yeah if you like the volatility you’re not thinking long term. I’d rather it stay at $5000 for 3 years and gain a reputation of stability rather than this shit. 
It’s fun to make money, but it’s more fun to replace the exisiting financial paradigm.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:34:00
I think that we are in a bubble currently. The use of BTC in terms of its utility isn’t high enough to justify this growth.
However, it is possible that the use of BTC will catch up to the price.
There is so much speculation currently and people looking to jump in quickly. It is extremely tempting to sell now and come back in after the situation is more clear to me.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:29:06
How so? 
@_date: 2018-09-18 00:39:17
It does make it more likely that they are selling it though

It's a mixture of marijuana and tobacco. It is not a cigar. You're being down voted because it isn't a cigar.

I don't know if you're being intentionally patronising or not.
Judging from other comments, I assumed he was smoking weed with Joe (who is known for it).
If it is a cigar, he is obviously smoking it as intended. If it is weed, he sure as shit is not.

I think that the US centric mindset places too much emphasis on physiological barriers. I think only 1/5 transactions are made within the US.
I never, ever look at the US price. I know Chinese guys who are the same. 
I’m sure that it has some impact, but really not as much as US people think.

How can you steal a market cap? Both can grow. Perhaps some users are going BTC to Ripple, but it doesn't mean that this is some organised takeover from banks.
This is some weak hands folding. People bought in expecting free money and as soon as it plateaued, they wanted out.
Days like this are cold days, not an ice age. It's normal and healthy 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:36:58
Are you stupid? Ripple and BTC aren't even competitors, they do two different things. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:49
While I think that OP is a little cringey, I'll elaborate on what he is saying.
Our governments are moving away from cash, so now we have to eat the consequences of being tracked constantly and having to use companies for all of our transactions. I was in NYC not long ago, and more and more stores are now not even accepting cash. I don't want the government knowing what I buy and where I go all of the time.
Moreover, we can't save our money because the interest rates are artificially low and inflation fucks us. In many parts of the world, we can only dream of owning a home, which we now can't secure a loan for because we lack the capacity to pay it off.
I'm hodling because I believe in this movement. I'd rather go down with this shit then play along with this bullshit game that we have inherited. Whether BTC is the next big step in how we exchange value or not, the current ship is sinking, and thats why banks and governments are scared.
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:11:45
I think it would vary.
Many would work more.
I would probably work less as I'm not really motivated by money. I see working as a way to purchase leisure time, holidays etc.

I can understand why you are nervous - don't be, its fun.
@_date: 2016-06-17 10:49:01
I moved .3 BTC into Ether early today, it then made that massive push and I thought I was a genius.
Then this happened.
I got out after it dropped 10%ish luckily, and still ended up on top.
@_date: 2016-06-17 10:43:06
Depends how much you have to risk.
I'm still a uni student, so 1 BTC is a lot for me. But if you make $100,000 a year, I'd say go right ahead and buy a couple.
Its weird times right now. You missed the boat for a massive price rise, but this price rise may seem tiny compared to the one that may come in 3 years - or next week.
I am saying buy some BTC, but how much is completely up to how comfortable with risk you are.

The USD is still probably considered stronger than the GBP, especially right now.
The USD is rubbish though in my opinion, but as long as conventional wisdom values it, it may as well be valuable, if you get what I mean.

If you were offering them, I'd probably want you to redeem then and then send them.
@_date: 2016-06-17 10:59:04
I'd buy 1 BTC, maybe consider some Lite or Ethereum too (although the latter just ate shit).
I'll probably get ridiculed by somebody for saying so, but you can't go wrong with some physical gold too. It just depends on your goals I guess.
I'm not super active, but I have 1.3 BTC, 14 Lite (Just sold my little Ethereum into it), 2 ounces of gold and on the JPY with a short position on the Pound and Euro.

No, you cannot.
It used to be treated as a good here, so you'd pay GST on it. It'd come up on the ticker next to gold, now it's considered an actual currency.

I never assumed superiority. 
I gave him my personal number, what else do you want me to do to help him out?
He sent me a link to a program that was clearly on the dodgy side. He made it clear that he wants to get into bitcoin because it’s flying up in value. He admitted to not understanding how it works, or even how to buy it. I spoke to him in detail about how BTC works, send him videos and gave him some advice on how to go about buying it and storing it.
You shouldn’t be so quick to judge people, or snarky.

But tell me, how will you make more money? Holding through a bubble to 0, or having strong and stable growth to 50k, 100k etc?
People need to know that they are buying BTC, not a digital tulip. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:57:44
I have a coin jar account but haven't used it much. Cointree has always been good for me.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:50:43
You place an order through cointree. They give you account details and a reference number. You go to the bank and deposit the amount that you ordered, and then the BTC will appear in your cointree account soon after (at which point it could be wise to transfer it to a device such as a trezor). 
If you go this route and need help, PM me. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:10:27
I agree with parts of this, but the .com bubble was really just a blip for a lot of companies. I really don’t want this technology to go to shit.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:14:46
I recommend spending the money on a ledger nano or trezor. They are really easy to use :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:00:12
I used to have some ETH. Now I only dabble in LTC occasionally and Ripple as my puntcoin of choice.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:02:27
I’d pay off the debt, and then buy BTC with the money that you would’ve been using to pay the debt off with over time.
For me, the peace of mind factor is huge. Additionally, as a previous comment says, you don’t want another scenario like 2008 screwing you over.
Yes, in the event of another economic collapse BTC should soar. But I’ll never put it past the powerful, government or otherwise, to find a way to f*ck people in the ass.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:12:20
Anybody who has anywhere near 50% of their value stored in BTC is an idiot.
Have some gold, have some real estate, have some shares. BTC is still ultimately speculative, and while it has some ethical and moral attractions, it’s important to understand its relatively early age.
Going into debt for a house is different - it’s a consumable. It may end up as a good investment, but you’re actually using it at the same time. 
BTC, or the technology behind it, is probably going to be the future of how we keep track of value. Have some, or have a lot of it, but FFS don’t put all of your eggs into one basket.

The one and only 'big drop' happened quite slowly, and had smaller surges along the drop as well. There were not only ample chances to get out over the months that it occurred, but chances to make money also. 
One thing that I like to consider is, do you believe that when a bitcoin is worth $10,000 you will sell it for standard currency, or will you be spending the bitcoin? It'll tell you a lot about how much belief you have in it going mainstream. 
I am aware that a complete collapse is a possibility, but I'm not worried as such. That would be my personality more than anything though, people are always different, and thus will have different ways of thinking on this. I don't think that bitcoin will make me a millionaire (because before that happens, I'll benefit on the Australian property bubble -_-).
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:22:40
When people answer poorly it is probably because they are frustrated at their lack of knowledge too, and are blindly hoping.
I'd agree that there is about a 50/50 chance of it going up/down, but the potential rewards of the 'up' far outweigh the risks of 'down'. Imagine if bitcoin gets adopted by more prominent online retailers, and more physical stores start accepting the new credit cards/debit cards (or whatever they are being called) that were launched not long ago. There are also things like the Trezor that are helping less technically sound users secure their funds...
If everything falls 'our' way, we will become very rich. But in saying that, governments will likely adopt blockchain technology and maybe bitcoin will become redundant... It is hard to tell. If we lose our money, at least we learnt a lot about economics in the meantime.
I would recommend investing in bitcoin, as the more users we have the better it is (lol). Don't just invest that amount in one go though, you should probably incrementally invest. Like, the price has gone a bit nuts today, but two weeks ago some people were saying bitcoin would be dead due to the EU... 
The other thing to weigh up is whether your investment is worth the opportunity cost. With that money would you be better off getting gold? Or perhaps would you like to buy and sell things with bitcoin as well as treating it as an investment. Thats what makes it interesting, it isn't gold, but it doesn't truly behave like a currency either due to investors having 5+ years in mind. 
Furthermore, we will often be subject to bigger players f***ing with things. Pump and dumps, ponzi schemes etc....
Nobody knows, but I'd recommend it. It is fun and has massive potential. Maybe one day a bitcoin will be worth $100k.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:59:48
Just google 'Trezor'. They are pretty straight forward and widely used :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:59:20
You're still not following.
Who is actually 'using' bitcoin? Not many people right now, most ownership is speculative and people exposing themselves to risk. This drive in value hasn't occurred because more people are 'using' bitcoin, its because more people are investing in bitcoin.
I'm 100% pro bitcoin, but you can't just ignore the couple of issues that are still around and what the situation actually is.
@_date: 2015-11-13 10:54:47
I'm still getting my head around the best way to secure my bitcoins. I'm currently using a web wallet that requires verification via email/sms, but that still doesn't seem super secure, hence I am looking into cold storage. Due to having a windows phone, there isn't an abundance of apps that I can use either. 
I am also considering using armory or electrum as a secondary wallet just to split them up a bit more. What would you consider the best way to generate my own private key? Thank you so much for your help.
Whilst I have the two step verification, a pin, and an 18 word encrypted  'thing', but it still feels so out of my control without having some sort of physical object to help prevent people from stealing. Maybe a Trezor will be the go.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:08:48
That's exactly right.
I don't have a whole lot in BTC. Some people ask if I'm comfortable with the risk. What risk?
I lose a few grand? I'd rather that than miss out on millions potentially.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:31:57
Currency will store value, but it is ultimately a medium to exchange value until it realises itself in a good, service or some other manifestation. Currency is only as good as the value that others see in it.
The volatility of BTC demonstrates that this is still shaky, which is something that has to calm down if it is to be a long term replacement for traditional fiat.
If BTC's use is for savings and speculation it'll never replace the dollar.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:43:08
No. Bitcoin's function is as a decentralised currency. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 11:53:35
Yeah, I have paper in my safe at home, and then another one somewhere else.
What would you say the best way to secure your bitcoins with something like electrum would be for somebody who is only mediocre with technology?
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:04:33
That doesn't change the value of a BTC.
Many people will still have resistance, in the same way that many have now, when the price goes up a lot, because they feel as though they've missed out.
The mainstream isn't like us, and a lot of 'us' have a philosophical tie to BTC as well - they don't.
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:21:29
I'm full primitive and have mine stored in a safe in my house and another note of my keys buried.
The more bitcoin hits the mainstream, the more options we will have. 
For years I didn't trust myself with cold storage and instead spread my BTC across multiple online wallets.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:19:01
When the graph scares you, zoom out.
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:43:25

@_date: 2015-11-26 22:26:25

@_date: 2017-05-26 02:33:38

I'm planning on selling into Aud, Ltc and eth.
I have a few accounts with different exchanges, so I will buy back when things settle down. I still don't have cold storage organised as I never trusted myself with it. I'll reward myself with a trezor through my profit.
