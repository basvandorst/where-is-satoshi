Buuuut it's backed by a currency which isn't backed by anything. 
Probably better than keeping money in your bank account but I wouldn't call it a good investment.

I don't want to put you down or sound like everyone else saying not to trade, but personally I did fairly well trading back in 2013, but it took some failures to realise 2 things. 
A) Not your keys, not your BTC. If you're leaving it all on an exchange to trade, you're risking it all even if your trades are going well, heard of MtGox? There's now a few examples of exchanges running away with customer funds. Might sound improbable but as you said this is still the wild west.  
B) If you're constantly looking for small wins, you'll only ever make small gains. If you're selling every time you gain 20% you're gonna miss out when it goes 2x, then 2x again, then again in a short time frame.

Crypto will never be adopted if people don't talk about it. Talk about crypto, just don't talk about your crypto.

Yeah don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of the system, we would all be better off without it, for example stores would be able to lower costs if not for the fees associated with credit cards. However if you can't change it, might as well take advantage of it.

It's not just about right capital at right time, it's about having the right idea before everyone else. The majority of the world could have spared a few dollars in 2010.

Yeah that's why dumb people will keep their BTC in other people's possession. We are already seeing crypto banks pop up, exchanges were the first thing boobs left all their crypto on, now there are things like Nexo who pay you to store your crypto there.

This, if you can get interest free loans then invest that money it starts to look far less stupid. Credit cards with interest free periods, rewards and balance transfer offers are the best value your average person can squeeze out of a bank.

Itself, it was about 3.5k at the beginning of the year.

The companies issue bonds, it's like me asking you to get a loan and not pay back the full amount. Like hey voodoodog, you mind if I borrow $100, I'll pay you back $90 next week homie? Then people are taking that deal in the hopes that tomorrow I'll only be willing to pay back $80 of a $100 loan, then the debt you hold(the $90 I owe you) will look appealing compared to lending me(the corporation), at that point you are able to sell your debt to somebody else for $105 because paying you $105 and getting $90 back is better than paying me $100 and getting $80 back. Now you're $5 in profit.
I'm no expert but that's how I understand it, and yes it's fucking insane and dodgy as fuck and shows the ridiculousness of the current financial systems.

Banks aren't zero risk. And more important than retaining currency is maintaining the value of what you hold, which dollars do not. I agree though BTC will not replace banks, hopefully it replaces the currencies they hold though.

Not always governments, corporations can issue bonds. And yes, when you give somebody money that you want to get back later, that is generally referred to as a loan.
