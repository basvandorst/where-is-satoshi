They still have to follow certain compliance rules if they want any hope of a payment processor to ever consider working with them.

What exactly happened right before the tipping point when he flipped the table?

Numerous transactions here with Ally, USAA, and a local credit union. No issues so far.

I mean, yeah, its discomforting, but US law basically requires that step in accordance with money transmitter and money laundering laws.
edit: Not saying to trust them. Just saying it *could* be a reason.

There's no way you'll get that hashing power for that cost in a single gaming rig.  Or even 100 gaming rigs.

The wiki for P2Pool doesn't mention merged mining?

Good thing on 8/16 they announced "Imporved" security.

It doesn't really matter.  I use an AMD Sempron 140 I think.

Oh, good to know.  I didn't actually want to try it and see, haha.  :)

You've got a point.  But I've sent the developer at least 6 emails and have gotten thorough, prompt responses.  Including the implementation of an entire requested feature in roughly 4 hours flat.  So my experience has been good thus far...

You're my hero.  I'll be switching my miners over later this evening and I'm excited to see how things pan out.
edit:  I can't save a bitcoin address, it keeps saying it is invalid.

Fair enough statement depending on the development environment you work in, but it was the sortable time column, not exactly something that's going to break your bank.

While the expertise behind Bitcoinica is arguable, I have been loving the site itself.
Their handling of this matter was, to me, quite elegant.  Prompt response, resolution, and open communication.  I couldn't really ask for more.

You can also short when utilizing available margin.

I've personally deposited a bitcoin, won a bitcoin on top of that after some time playing, and successfully withdrew everything.
Depositing took seconds.  Withdrawing took about 8 hours.  YMMV.
I *think* if your computer crashes or your browser crashes, you're SOL for getting your deposited coins back.  Just like with Bitcoins themselves, don't put into it what you aren't willing to lose...
