It makes a lot of sense.  Credit Cards are reoccuring, they make a lot of money that way.  Paying with bitcoins is not reoccurring the user would have to go to the site every month to submit a payment.  They lose out on money that way when Credit Cards makes things simpler.

Will most definitely give this a shot.  I use cex.io and by some hashing power with some spare coins.  Haven't had any issues with them.

I forgot the anonymity.  My girlfriend would be upset if she saw a CC bill for this.  But she doesn't know how much bitcoin I have.  Buahahah.

That was a great laugh.

It is actually disabled.  
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:59:30
It was disabled at the start.

I didn't know that existed thanks, I will X-post this there.  There is no transactions on my account which is odd to me.
Wait I found the transaction! 10 BTC is there a way to cancel that?

I can't freaking wait!  By the time I get my Jalepeno I probably wouldn't make much.  But still glad to have something.

I already enabled it.  I have control over the account.  If this does go through, I could have made $500 off of this theif if I sold now.

The only thing shady I really have is my pirated OS. :/  I don't recall downloading anything that would compromise anything.

So they know its you...?  Every single one of these bitcoin sites you sign up for asks for this information.  I don't think I have found 1 site that has not asked for anything besides a username and password.
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:49:56
Yes, yes it is.
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:44:56
I sent them an email.  I don't see anything that says cancel...

This thief could have actually made me some good money haha if it does go through.

I was very new to the scene.  I haven't even heard of 2FA.  My account was dormant and I never even logged into it, until recently when I saw that $6000 charge.
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:19:12
Sadly I didn't.  I never used the account since March.  Very well could have been my fault.  I was knew to the scene then.  Had no clue what Two Factor meant until now of course.
