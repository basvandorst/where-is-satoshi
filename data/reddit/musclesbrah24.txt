So that mean we should buy before the herd?
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:41:27
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:02:28
What? How would they not know? They have got to keep up with the bitcoin news. You are telling me every miner is clueless to what is going on?
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:31:33
True or not?
In order for lightning to be adopted, miners will have to choose the bitcoin community over their own selfishness and greed for making money?
How are we going to get all the miners to just give up getting paid a lot of money? 
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:44:43
Why is everything so slow now?
Stock market is mooning in the other hand
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:07:54
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:12:25
Why does it take so long? Aren’t we considered the miners in IOTA?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:48:12
Why is it dropping now? Was banking on Futures getting huge gains
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:45:04
Oololol the red pill
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:03:50
It’s perceived, hype, FOMO. Terrible technology wise. Everything is more advance. It’s the hard truth nobody wants to hear.
Keep in mind. I do own one bitcoin myself. Losing hope.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:49:06
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:38
I have to go back and count this? That’s why I mentioned multiple exchanges and transactions switching from hardware wallet and gdax. It’s s mess, I have no idea what my cost basis is
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:11
Yeah, what the hell? One thing I hate about this sub is when anyone mentions bitcoin cash, It's an attack. lol wtf. 
Should have went with my gut and diversified now I'm at a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:13:24
I was reading deeper and saw that ripple actually was actually decentralized. Anyone can confirm?
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:10:53
Why does it keep dropping now? The only thing bitcoin has going is the lightning network. I know people don’t like hearing it, but other than that it’s dead. 
What is status of lightning network? I feel like haven’t heard a damn thing about it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:48:45
I was banking on it rising because of futures
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:10:56
I don’t get why whales do this, they don’t have anymore bitcoin when they do this
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:31
SPEAK UP PANIC SELLERS, WHY YOU SELLING??
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:05:08
It seems to me that bitcoin price effects the demand for future, but same can't be said the other way around. Futures can only influencer bitcoin price, by hype. But since we are getting closer to futures and its dropping, IDK
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:02:32
A part of me doesn’t want to sell because I don’t know how to do taxes for this. I used like 3 different exchanges. So I have no idea what to do
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:15:28
LOL at these panic sellers. Bitcoin gonna go under 10k at this rate
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:12:27
What is the status of lightning network? When will it be implemented?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:53
Does anyone invest in both bitcoin and bitcoin cash, I have bitcoin only currently. BCH just went to like 8k real quick. Then I saw it got disabled. Why is everyone against bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:05
Right, right first time I started panicking seeing the gains of bcash. Still predicting which coin will be added next. Will be a surge.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:30:30
Was just gonna buy at under 11k and now its back up. Holy crap at volatility. It changes  by the 100s in seconds
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:23:42
Just now you realized this is a problem? $5 fees were already a problem. I HODL bitcoin and even I can look past my own bias that bitcoin has no real use as of this writing.
There are numerous examples of businesses stop using bitcoin.
If you use bitcoin to buy something now you’re being an idiot. 
I will probably just buy more for investment purposes
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:46:42
Damn that’s a while...it’s the only thing I’m banking on with bitcoin.
If it doesn’t work out as a scaling option, I will dump all in alts
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:30
Why does everyone keep saying "attack" Maybe its smarter to diversify? Mad I got sucked in with the mentality of this sub. Extremely bias.
First rule of investing: Diversify
But this sub screwed my mentality up.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:48:13
Damn, I know! I am debating if Bitcoin futures is good or bad still
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:43:47
Damn why does it keep dropping now?
There more good news than bad right?
Good = Lightning Network, Futures, and ETFs
Bad = Bitcoin Cash attack, Fees, Exchange gotcha hacked.
If you sold, comment why you sold
Edit: actually bcash is dropping hard also??
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:09:32
Sweet, just did it. Going to send it to exchange and actually buy Bitcoin Cash. It sucks that I have to go through bitcoin to get bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:18:30
Where do I check hash power and where it moves?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:27:23
Lol I have no choice, but to HODL. Losing everything. God I’m mad. It will be $3000 by tomorrow
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:23:47
I know, I feel like it’s manipulated. I lost all my money.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:59:08
When is this happening? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:09:02
It’s crazy, I can’t sleep man. I blink my eyes and it’s up another 10%
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:09:27
Oh ok thanks, are you HODLing, why are they moving to bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:06:43
Lol I gotta, what’s pushing bitcoin so high now? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:06:28
What do you mean crypto run on the bank
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:02:11
It keeps dropping goddamn, I don’t have any hope because there is no solution to the scaling issue. It might actually be dead
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:43:30
The one thing that I don’t like about crypto though is that if I transfer between multiple wallets I have, I have to pay a fee. With banks I don’t. Like transferring a related bank account to another or checking to savings. That’s why I hate having too many wallets, fees build up for no reason. Paying a fee to transact myself.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:16:49
Besides fomo and demand, probably still futures and bitflyer coming to us.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:12:22
Lol I’m running a startup as well, I am too deep in a loss, I have to HODL
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:13:10
7k wowoweso
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:03:45
I thought it was the best time to buy during a correction because the price is low?
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:09:59
Should I buy as much before Bitcoin Futures and fork? Free coins right? 
I don’t think there is gonna be a dip, unless someone else can say so
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:19:24
But you have to have fiat in coinbase and that alone thats over a week to get there. By that time the price has changed dramatically. Then you can use gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:16:23
I want a another dip, goddamn
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:35:49
Why is this a good thing?? Now we don’t have a solution to high fees and scaling.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:09:27
I mean this correction is just happening, it will bounce back, or so I hope. This happened many times during BTC history.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:30:58
Take into consideration real life. Shit happens. Being an optimist is better than a pessimist, but realist destroys both. I'm glad your relationship is good, but its life. Shit ALWAYS happens
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:50:29
Ahhhhh!!!!!! Shit should have bought more
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:14:59
Why not? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:37:56
If I don't accept to pay them, them I won't be able to transfer? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:40:11
How do I get segwit on trezor or breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:41:49
once BTC use becomes frictionless or easier than a bank. It will dominate
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:39:41
Well, I can't. I don't know what you are talking about. For example, I wanted to send $20 BTC and it cost $5 fee. How do I know if my wallet has segwit adoption?
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:41:17
This is why its hard for BTC to dominate globally. The common person wouldn't want to jump through all these hoops and would rather just use a bank.
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:36:50
I am assuming your are mocking or are sarcastic. But anyways. This its the problem. If bitcoin ever will get bigger, then yeah...its has to be less work for global adoption. As of now, banks are much easier. They have less friction than BTC. If using BTC takes very little work, only then we will see BTC dominate the world.
