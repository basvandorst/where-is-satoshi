I expect everyone will listen to what you have to say if you call them “morons” and “idiots” first.

Whats the angle of the scam here? I don't really understand what they're aiming to do..?

I just don't think anybody is taking financial advise written in biro on a banknote.

How did you make the payment? Online banking? In branch?
You wouldn't be able to make a payment to Belgium without a SWIFTBIC code, so surely you'd have known you're making a SEPA payment?

I agree that it's bullshit, but I'm pretty sure they can reserve the right to do business with whoever they want to.

Yeah, I got an unrequested 10-12 paragraph PM yesterday.  
Needless to say I read it all, had my opinions throughly changed, sold all my Bitcoin and bought a bunch of Ethernet coins or whatever it is.

Imagine being so morally bankrupt that you end up  writing sentences as idiotic as this because it's the only way you can justify your views to yourself.

@_date: 2017-08-18 17:44:35
But we commented 'very fake news' on the internet over and over, how can that be?
Honestly, the comments on here are as good an argument against getting involved in the bitcoin scene as I've ever seen.
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:26:21
I do actually agree with you that the 'down with banks' posts here get pretty tiresome and overblown. This sub definitely gets a bit full blown libertarian..
**However**, if you're comparing Bitcoin to 'products', you've really missed the point and benefit of Bitcoin, and particularly the Blockchain. If you aren't just trolling, I would urge you to look into it (seeing the benefits of the Blockchain doesn't require you to put a single penny into Bitcoin).

Good lord this is some shit, get it together guys.

There simply aren't enough of them in any coherent movement for the banks to even notice.
People on this sub need to stop trying to make this non-story a thing, it's embarrassing.
@_date: 2019-01-08 23:15:25
I'm sure the banks are terrified of a handful of idiots withdrawing a few thousand euros.

I expect whatever’s making it look 3D is down the the display, so I doubt it will come across in a screenshot. If you’ve ever seen ArsTechnica on an iPhone it’s like how their orange writing looks 3D.

Boy do I have some exciting news for you..!

Holy shit, keep going, I'm enjoying the zoo.

Wake up and look behind the curtain every once in a while. Not surprised your mainstream media aren't telling you about it. Think for yourself and don't be a sheep.

I think Bernie Stalin and Killary are ok anyway, at least they're not Marxists. 
Wake up sheeple! I hope you think about that when you're old enough to vote.

Pretty low bar to set considering that includes most governments on the planet, most of whom manage to run their countries without making themselves into a spectacle daily. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 09:07:47
Sorry, I must've missed where you made an argument. 
No wonder the Bitcoin community is regarded as a joke, we have people that actually use the word 'sheeple' without irony. Get a grip mate. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:52:59


Haha, you're either a parody or an idiot, and I don't care to find out.

No offense but this is spam surely? Just a link to some random niche porn site?
Don't get me wrong, it's great that they accept bitcoin, but still..

Hopefully one day it will remind you to look up if Zimbabwe's hyperinflation was because *"banks fuck[ed] up"* or not.
