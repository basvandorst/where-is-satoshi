This, evidently, is true. :P

That's good advice! But two things: I already have about 45% of my income going to paying off debt/savings, and, I don't consider this new venture to be an investment. I'm really excited to spend my coins.

What is unsafe about my wallet? I'm genuinely curious!

I have been! I got my vape sorted out 2 months ago, and am currently at 1 to 2 real cigarettes a day. The last few are really hard to drop, but I'll get there soon, I know it.

Thanks! This is great, I shall explore them. I find I never have really understood something until I can contribute to it meaningfully.

Can.. Can I brag about having Bitcoin here? :P
The wallet seed / private key problem is very valid. I'm still trying to find the solution that works for me, to balance security and practicality... I'm probably going to end up with a few options, like a words-on-paper wallet for more regular use with a couple backups, and a multi-sig wallet holding the bulk of my coins with one signature encrypted in my email / on my person and the other signature encrypted at my parents house and in a safety deposit box. Does that sound about right? To access my cold-storage, someone would need a) access to either me or my email (or my house), b) access to my parents house or the safety deposit box and c) my encryption password.

Hmm, but I have a HD wallet with many addresses, won't re-use addresses, and don't have a paper wallet (except for my mnemonic written down)... This is all in my post!

Running a full node is something my friend does, and it seems fun! Unfortunately right now it's not in the cards, I live in shared housing so the internet is horrible and slow, and I only have a laptop and it doesn't have enough space available. When I can afford to move to my own place, I'll definitely consider it! :D
