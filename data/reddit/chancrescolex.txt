 SECOND NOW
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:30:53
I just paid $12 to send $20 out of Coinbase...
@_date: 2015-12-13 19:21:32
I can tell from some of the pixels
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:28:30
I wouldn't be shocked if we were at the moon very soon
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:39:11
Yeah, much better than "Working on it guys, lol"
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:45:09
Their blog post isn't very clear. I suggest anyone who wants more information go to and post questions.
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:34:40
If you click on the link that you're commenting on it takes you to a blog post that explains what it is. There is also for updates and questions.
@_date: 2014-01-30 22:08:15
You need a free miner as well
@_date: 2014-10-26 05:07:32
Jesus, how many of these drugcoin things are there?
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:27:56
Just to be clear, I know this isn't reddit bitcoin. They can't be mined and it isn't based on bitcoin source code, but they confirmed that it will use blockchain technology. 
They have a subreddit (where you can ask questions and I asked if notes will be fractional like bitcoin, and the answer is yes. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 14:19:18
Short answer: No.
Long answer: Hell no.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:41:02
Hey guys, did you know MtGox was originally a Magic The Gathering card trading site?
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:47:42
I asked in their subreddit and they will be fractional similar to bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:56:58
Did anyone say TwitPay yet?
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:00:56
Do you think it's likely that someone will give you a piece of hardware that they paid thousands of dollars for?
Really if you could even get a block erupter then that's at least something but if you paid for one then you would never ROI. I'm not positive but I think if you got one for free you'd still be just about breaking even with electricity cost. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:32:28
You haven't lost anything until you sell. Let's put this into perspective:
Think about the people who bought at $250+ last April just before the crash. At the time it seemed like all hope was lost. BUT if they held for a couple months then they could have sold for over $1000. 
Hold. Don't sell.
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:18:06
Don't worry about it. There is no hell.
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:12:37
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:14:54
I wish there was some kind of cryptocurrency that could also stop such fraud.
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:09:43
It is consistent. They give out 950,000 notes, one to each of 950,000 users. The users can then tip or spend fractional amounts.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:43:56
If you think that's bad, I bet you didn't know that MtGox was originally a Magic The Gathering card trading site.
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:32:18
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:31:25
Yes, I mentioned that in another comment. 


@_date: 2014-10-26 04:52:53
Here's what you do:
* **Don't** have any cash visible in your car.
* **Thoroughly** know your rights so you know when a cop does and doesn't have the right to search your car (and you can avoid their scare tactics).
* Start thinking about how **ridiculous** it is that any of these things are necessary.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:19:17
If you're worried switch to Authy or Google Authenticator on your phone
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:36:05
It's technically not an altcoin. I probably should have left "reddit bitcoin" out of the title. I didn't mean it seriously and a lot of people are being misled by it. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:17:57
Not this again...
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:25:52
Wow, did you come to that conclusion all by yourself?
@_date: 2014-08-25 19:07:47
"Bitcoin Cafe" translates to an expense account for all his tasty coffee drinks

@_date: 2014-02-16 16:48:04
Did you have a kickstarter account? It's possible that your email has been compromised and they went through your email and found your Gox login credentials.
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:41:28
Not totally. It has one specific point. (I still think it's a load of shit though)

Is reddit's cryptocurrency guy named Mark, by any chance?
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:48:17
They haven't specified yet, but I imagine something like buying reddit gold or for use on redditgifts.
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:38:30

Yeah, that's why.

How do I put US dollar bills on a flash drive?
Are you talking about those blipcoin things people use for drugs?
@_date: 2014-12-24 14:47:26
I've seen the same issue reported by others many times. All it takes is a simple email to customer service and they will usually manually approve the transaction and honor the original price. They just have an automated system that sometimes flags purchases as high risk when they really aren't. Is it kinda shitty? Yeah, but they're pretty good about making it right.
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:18:44
I use Authy for Mt. Gox. Not sure what you're talking about.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:09:02
AutoModerator can be set up to automatically remove posts/comments that contain a certain URL. I do this in when I notice repeat spam.

They are giving them out based on account activity, so I assume they have some type of algorithm that will determine which accounts are worthy and which ones aren't. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:06:22

Gox part 2
@_date: 2015-01-11 16:28:00
Yes, but it's actually very common that most people who are shadowbanned take a while to realize it. They continue to use reddit normally and think that nobody is responding to their comments/posts.
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:38:50
Yeah it's more effective than notifying the person that they're banned. At least it takes a while before they realize and make a new account.
@_date: 2015-05-02 18:39:30
I ain't even mad
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:48:46
And a way to promote his business on reddit
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:08:45
You're delusional. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:46:06
Since there are several people posting the same thing right now, you should make one megathread and all of you find the common factor between you. Did you all have Kickstarter accounts? Did you all download a trading client from the same place? Are you using the same app on your phones? Do any of you have 2FA enabled? Etc, etc. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 21:40:17
Coinbase already has a system in place where you can disclose vulnerabilities to them and potentially get paid for them.
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:23:36

@_date: 2018-03-26 02:01:55
You might want to delete this comment. People have gotten their accounts suspended recently for similar comments due to Reddit’s new rules about buying/selling anything illegal on here. Even for obvious jokes.
@_date: 2015-09-02 16:26:15
How about giving us the salt length?

They usually include English at the end. You needed to file a claim already for lost funds, and if you didn't you're probably SOL. Check out @_date: 2015-11-14 18:39:41

@_date: 2015-11-05 01:46:33
It was an accident. I thought they usually just automatically included it.

As someone with a lot of admin experience on a popular server, if there is an exploit to be found someone will find it. A few dev's can't debug quite like a server full of people can. And client side hacks can include a lot more than fly and noclip. Something as simple as using a flood command to lag/crash the server could mean lost BTC if bets were being processed, or however it's all set up. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:20:04
Honestly, that's your own fault. I understood the directions on Gox's site perfectly. I ended up just using the Google Authenticator app on my phone. Same security and it's free. I also made a paper backup of my key for the authenticator in case my phone is ever destroyed. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 15:02:27
Someone was running a bot on gox that made .01 trades every second or so for days. I'm not really sure what their goal is but it's insanely aggravating.
@_date: 2013-08-31 16:24:28
Come over to if you want some real insight.
There is a whale making buys that equate to a ~13% price rise usually in a 4 hour period. Next one may possibly push us to ~160 [gox] 
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:39:18
The price.

The backgrounds on some of those cards look familiar. Is it royalty free artwork / do you have the rights to use it? If not, you might run into some headaches once you start selling them.

This is a free to use and distribute security pattern that can be used for paper wallets to prevent someone from shining light through to read/scan your private key, or to be used however your heart desires (non-commercial). I based the design on the one that is used by safepaperwallet.com.
I also have a seamless vector tile available if anyone wants it. And I shamelessly accept tips.

CampBX's API seems fine. I have other ticker's running off it with no issues.
**edit:** Looks like it's updating sporadically.

I was told by a friend that beta 5 was very stable and they had no issues with authenticator. The apps keys are only backed up if you enable encrypted backups, which I didn't. I'm all set now though. I had printed backups of the QR codes and I'm using Authy now.

You can deposit to CampBX for free with a money order. Not sure on the wait time. By the time you get the money to an exchange the price could be back up to $120-$130. I tried getting money into CampBX through Dwolla right after the price fall from $250+ to $50. By the time my money finally transferred over the price was above $100. I still could have bought in and made a nice profit but I was a bit weary at that point.
