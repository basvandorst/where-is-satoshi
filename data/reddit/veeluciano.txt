Renewable energy is a bit more expensive, I agree. Which is why we need to invest more into it. Green energy in the long-run will help planet Earth with sustainability.
Most of America runs on coal and nuclear power. Nuclear power plants have to be decommissioned over a number of years, which will end up costing more overtime. It's incredibly hard to store and has to be stored deep underground. Additionally, incidents like Fukeshma have left Earth with catastrophic environmental effects.
I'm not too familiar with Australia, but I did read that they have off-shore turbines. The United States is also testing off-shore turbines in Rhode Island, and may soon expand accross the coast.

You beat me to it. I honestly logged on today just to post this horrible article. The fact that Google's algorithms placed this article in the news-feed for Bitcoin shows how Google isn't fighting fake news. John calls Bitcoin a fake currency with no explanation to back up his argument.
