Is blockchain.info purposely filtering out the stress test transactions? (3k on blockchain.info vs. 7k on tradeblock)

Gawd, just BIP 100 already.

I don't have a Top 10 list, anything by Andreas Antonopoulos works of course - but it really depends on your level of understanding. One video was particularly enlightening when I was just learning the basics: [Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Crash Course with Andreas Antonopoulos - Jefferson Club Dinner Meetup] (

The movie looks good, I was excited to see it regardless. But with Bitcoin playing a role in the movie just makes it so much better.
Edit: I'd really like to see A$AP Rocky accept Bitcoin... I even generated a few vanity addresses for him xD ([tweet](

Somehow not surprised. Citing liquidity though - that's worrying.

Not to disagree or anything but `60*60*24*14` is pretty clearly seconds/minutes/hours/days.. it's the "two-week grace period".

The distinction isn't "P2P cash" vs. "Settlement Layer" ... the distinction is "P2P" vs. "Centralized". The only important thing is mantaining decentralization - we already have PayPal.

I'm in Spain. I have a Coinbase account. Why do I not see this option? Do I need to attach my bank account first? That sort of defeats the purpose.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:33:22
Twice. What's your point? No where is there mention of (or allusion to) either 'Bitcoin' or 'settlement' in the paper. Your title implies a counter-argument to [this post]( but there is nothing to compare. A more apt title would have simply been "Ideal Money" or "Philosophy of Money". That's my point.

Cool. The idea is great. I would help test it with testnet coins.

Ok, I see what you're saying. It still remains to be seen how this could work, but I guess a lot more of the pressure will lay on the market makers who will assume the risks and charge accordingly. Shapeshift is yet another centralized system.
Edit: I'm not saying it's necessarily a great thing, but most of the reviews are comparing it to bitcoin like if it is a competing currency.. which it is not.

Agree. I fully support BlockTrail and like the approach their wallet takes, but it still has some minor inconvenience bugs that prevent me from recommending it. I'm sure they'll polish it up soon!

Signed up for Xapo just a few hours ago. Experience thus far: (1) logging in to the website app does NOT work -for me- on Chrome (Firefox works though); and (2) the 2FA being done through their own mobile wallet app doesn't make sense to me -- why not use Google Authenticator like everyone else? Next I'll be applying for the plastic card, let's how smoothly the KYC goes...
Edit: FWIW wasn't loading in Chrome because of ad blocker and it is possible to set up Google Authenticator you just have to do it before linking your phone, so unlink then link again afterwards.

I agree that the last-mile is what incurs most the cost, but the real beauty of using bitcoin is the security in the settlement. Traditional remittance companies are extremely prone to fraud.

What these people are missing is that to get in on the one-true-ledger-aka-Bitcoin you have to go through centralized on-ramps. With an inter-ledger protocol we could essentially remove the barrier of moving between one system and another. That's the beauty I see in it.
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:18:14
Sure, it's Ripple-esque and proposed by Ripple employees - but how is this Ripple (a centralized, semi-closed source system)? This is not a payments network. It allows for the communication between networks. Actually sounds to me like a step towards that much sought after 'decentralized exchange'.
