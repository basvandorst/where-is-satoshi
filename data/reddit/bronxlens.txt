IMHO, wait 'till Apple or Samsung, etc., make one of its iGadgets a BitWallet with an app that makes paying and getting paid as easy (or easier) than PayPal and many banks currently do, and things will begin to change quickly. 
Once the technology is in place you will begin to see celebrities begin to embrace BitCoin publicly. I can see major league, pro players, Hollywood and recording megastars, many demanding to get paid often in Bitcoin, and further change will take place.

I am in the U.S.  
So this past weekend I got the [Circle Bitcoin iPhone app]( linked my bank account and purchased my very first Bitcoin! It was less than US $100 since I am just testing the waters. Anything in particular that I should do next?  
Also, what if by the end of the year I have a significantly larger amount saved in Bitcoin, how do I deal with it next year come tax-filing time? Since I moved it from savings (for which I already paid taxes) do I have to report it?  
Last question, while the funds are in Circle my bitcoins do not earn interest. Are there currently other vetted-and-safe places to keep one's Bitcoin in which one would earn interest?   
Thanks everyone!

Seems like it's very easy to send someone money via PayPal, even without a PayPal account, so my quest. is:  
What is the easiest way to send someone some Bitcoin? Do they need a Bitcoin account first? What's the relationship of a Bitcoin wallet with all of this?  
What is the best written intro to Bitcoin that explains everything ELI5-style?

Newbie to Bitcoin and of course, the Blockchain &amp; Lightning. Any good source to read and learn more about them?

What is the best guide, yours included, to read as an intro (where to buy it, store it, etc) to Bitcoin?
