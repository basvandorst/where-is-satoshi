Altcoins are not a threat to Bitcoin, seriously, that's why it's called **alt**coin, they're just alternatives to support the technology and most of them are only used for trading.

Officially released? Why aren't there any announcements in talk and org site?

Cryptography is not new during the 90s. In fact, Cypherpunks are already active since the late 80s

You wouldn't imagine what kind of bullshit people are saying in BTC-e chat. They keep saying LTC is way better than BTC, nobody will use BTC anymore because of LTC, BTC was only invented to launder money and LTC was created to clean its mess, they even compare it to television sets (LTC) and fm radio (BTC) jesus fucking christ

The only thing I like about PayPal is the instantaneous payment and convenient credit card &amp; bank account handling but the transaction fees can be really outrageous sometimes, even when just withdrawing your own cash to your bank account. This is why I start to like Bitcoin because users are free from the leash of huge transaction fees by payment companies.

It's extremely hot in SEA region today (I live in the Philippines) and a lot of people here don't know anything about Bitcoin even though there are already few local exchanges (coins.ph, bitcoinpinoy.net, buybitcoin.ph). Anyway, good luck there in Thailand and enjoy the eternal summer heat.

We need to simplify Bitcoin in order to increase the rate of mass adoption. One common problem why people won't bother with Bitcoin is because they don't understand the technology instead they keep comparing it to credit cards and payment processors since it's easier for them to access and adopt to those primitive payment methods

I'm a late adopter (only got into Bitcoin last year) and I started with the original full node client as my main wallet instead of being impatient and just go with lightweight clients because it feels right to use the original client and be an essential part of the growing network. It didn't bother me even a lot of users say it's a complete waste of time and resources. I'm happy that a lot of redditors are also running a full node.

Can I get a bite?

IDK why a lot of people are worried about the blockchain size considering most of them are only using lightweight clients. I've been using the original client as my main wallet and I've been running a full node since I heard of Bitcoin last year. As of now, the enitre blockchain size is **less than 20GB** (entire *blocks* folder: **19.3GB**; *blk00000*-*blk00137.dat*: **17.1GB**) and it perfectly fits in a 32GB microSD.

It's in the chainstate folder
