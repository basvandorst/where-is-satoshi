They haven't "officially" done anything yet. In the mean time All of that chinese volume is likely still in the marketplace, and the capitulation is happening by default - the invisible hand is stronger than Ike Turners pimp hand. People take care of their own interests, you can still see it on fiatleak.com if you pass through there. Take note of how much bitcoin volume is STILL China based.
 
In fact any Chinese holders of bitcoin are Better off today than before the announcement to obstruct it are they not? The announcement they will capitulate will come soon. Because they are powerless to stop it - unless they decide that the N. Korean model (isolation) for commerce is better. 
They will not let the rest of the world get ahead of them on this. Even if its not bitcoin - electronic currency is going nowhere and our Eastern friends know this. I think they REALLY know this.
I like to speculate that they recognized what was happening in November as the bitcoin  markets took off, and made headlines to get a discount on Bitcoin at the last point in time they would have the ability. Crash and Buy anyone?
Has anyone looked at the sharp reduction of Gold purchasing by the Chinese government all of the sudden? *Evil Grins*

Actually, you just made it sound that way. But who is keeping score? ;) 
Another point, bitcoin is about buying and selling things, not "moving cash in and out of China".
My comment was to address the ineffectual Chinese policy of "banning" bitcoin purchases with Chinese Fiat. 
Simply put, it doesn't matter what china thinks. Just like it doesnt matter what china thinks about what we allow our people to read on the interwebz.

Capitulating. What would you call it? 
My comment was related to the headlines.
