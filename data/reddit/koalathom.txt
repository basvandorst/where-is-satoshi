Buy more if you can afford it (only invest what you're prepared to lose), otherwise HODL

Not necessarily, but more power for big money to influence or even downright control market

With the discrepancies in exchanges this high, what's to stop me from buying on coinbase, selling on bithumb and rinse/repeating?

It may sound cliche, but just HODL. BTC goes up and it goes down. Don't get too high on the ups and too scared on the downs. I bought my first bitcoin at 4500$ and freaked out and panic sold when it got down to $3500 a few months ago. A couple weeks later it was pushing 5.5k when I bought again. Just last week it went from 7.7k to 5.9k and the urge to panic sell was at an all time high again, but I held strong and were pushing that 7k+ again just a week later. It's a roller coaster for sure, but learn from my mistakes and just take the time to scroll out when you're scared.

The best time to buy bitcoin was 5 years ago, the second best time is now

It goes up, it goes down, just don't panic sell. You can't predict the future and you probably aren't an expert on markets so don't pretend like you can and are. Just HODL (hold on for dear life), and if you ever feel bad about losing money then scroll out a few months.
