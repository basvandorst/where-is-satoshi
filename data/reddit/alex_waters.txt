I don't think that forcing bitcoin users or miners to do anything is reasonable.
Just pointing out that PoW doesn't establish a system of decentralized consensus as we've seen with centralized mining.
There could be alternatives to PoW as the platform for coin distribution and network protocol enforcement - and it might be worthwhile for the Bitcoin community to at least discuss new concepts.
@_date: 2016-04-20 20:53:22
Reputation and trust networks are (IMHO) the only way we can have real decentralized systems. 
Bitcoin has very much proven that one cpu does not equal one vote.
PoW is not effective in preventing centralization. If it were effective: we would not have massive industrial mining facilities that can implement network changes at will which affect all Bitcoin users. Coalitions of mining pools de facto govern Bitcoin.
Maybe mining centralization can still provide for an effective system (benevolent dictator). But I'm not taking stock in that.

You can't argue against the mob mentality here, it's so draining and a waste of valuable, intelligent people's time. I hope spends some of that funding on building a bot. The bot will respond to these trolls with a link to his previous explanations.
Even if that money was given to Theymos flat-out as repayment for maintaining the forums, keeping them resilient against the many attacks, and keeping the bills paid - the return is 10x for how important those forums were early days for the community.
Without the bitcoin forums that many of us used early on: Bitcoin would not have progressed as quickly as it did.
Theymos is either someone who fostered a great deal of important communication for this community and one of the more important early adopters - or the worst thief in all of bitcoinland.

This has been an issue since the original implementation. Using IP addresses, email addresses, centralized repo like the MIT PGP database, etc.

Real transparency will give political and financial control back to the people. 
There is an opportunity over the next 50 years for humans to take control of governments. We have the technology that facilitates making non-profits, political campaigns, etc. transparent if global consensus (facilitated by decentralized voting) or market forces dictate that financial transparency is better.
(Example. a non-profit would have a competitive advantage to opening its books via 3-step accounting on public blockchain because donors are more likely to donate to a transparent non-profit rather than a secretive one.)
We can accomplish that transparency without de-privitising individuals. This is now possible with the concept of a decentralized ledger. As Garzik says, currency is but one feature. It just happened to be the one we worked on first.

It sounds like Gavin is knocking it out: 
I love that these "bugs" end up becoming references to how quickly the core-dev team adapts to necessary changes. Remember the catastrophically anticipated hard fork? NBD
That's not to say that something buggy couldn't affect the ecosystem severely. But up until this point, the community has quickly patched any issues. They turn out to be minor inconveniences and not as dramatic as they are hyped to be.
People aren't selling off their dollars (well maybe now) when the banks shut down for holidays and weekends. Having an occasional day or two of downtime, especially at this early stage is a positive thing in my opinion. It is important to me that Bitcoin remains evolutionary and responsive.

Most banks/compliance/accountants will want an objective 3rd party institution to do discovery and vouch for your possession of the funds. 
We did this with CoinApex as a proof of concept to help a guy get a mortgage. 
In my opinion it's going to be a while before there are businesses that provide this kind of underwriting. There are a ton of legal issues with guaranteeing someone else's assets, there is not much demand for it right now, and it's typically individuals seeking this service (so not the big $$$ underwriters typically deal with.)
My advice would be to use something like private message signing, and explain that it shows that you possess the address and that they can check the history of funds via blockchain.info
If you want to CC me on the email, I'd be happy to vouch for the methodology you use. 
Of course there are some caveats, signing a private message does not ultimately show possession of the funds in a purist sense. Someone could have signed it on your behalf, you could be under duress, etc. 
But for all intents and purposes we have found that it's sufficient for the large majority of underwriting scenarios. They just want reasonable certainty that you can back up what you claim.

Sending bitcoins to IP or email addresses was considered a feature by many since very early days. I believe Satoshi had an implementation of the send-to-IP, and others have had implementations of send-to-email.
These concepts bring up major privacy issues with this particular community, and they are difficult to fortify against MitM attacks.
Regardless, Sathoshi would have likely proxied his real IP in some way.

The regulations are a major choke point, but the unbanking of bitcoin business is equally as destructive.
Bitcoin is one of those burn the bridge behind us kind of situations. It is extremely important for startup Bitcoin businesses to have access to banking so that they can grow.
In the US, this banking issue is more of a problem for startups than the entirety of regulation affecting Bitcoin businesses.
Politicians can compel banks to work with Bitcoin businesses. My understanding is that it is illegal to discriminate against these business for political reasons,  which is what is happening. (The same reason banks cannot unbank gun shops because they disagree with gun laws.)

That depends on whether you ascribe every card to 0...51
There is an additional existential issue of people using common number patterns to construct a keyspace. For example, someone may have a preference for Aces, and thereby reduce the keyspace by tending toward aces.
This type of error in ascribing an absolute keyspace, when there are threats to the size of that keyspace, is common.
Using a series of english language words for example; it introduces human psychology, and the calculation of entropy cannot be relied on in purity.

Just that the release process as described by Mike is accurate. Apparently no love for qa...I was busy testing release binaries and writing code for bitinstant so that the general public could obtain / use bitcoins .

I think we want to offer users both styles of tracking. Some exchange APIs are pretty robust and give insight into more transaction details than the blockchain transaction alone. 
For example, we may be able to generate reports for coin pricing at the time of sale, track trading performance, etc.

There is no support for attempting to innovate in this blatant problem-set. People still wants to believe that Bitcoin is anonymous.
Similar to the internet, I believe most traffic will be fairly transparent and there will be systems like Tor for greater privacy. The beauty of Bitcoin is that there is a real opportunity for the market to decide how it should work.
Unfortunately, it's political suicide to tackle the problem at this time.

That's a good point about the default state being watch-only mode. I would encourage API developers to give their user's granular control over what requests can be made. I believe Coinbase (thumbs up), along with several other exchanges do this currently. Even still, having protections on both sides makes a lot of sense.
The tax thing was part of the impetus for this project, it is frustratingly hard to keep track of our personal bitcoin transactions over the course of a year - let alone categorize them for taxes and calculate which type of tax applies.
That component may take some research, as we wouldn't want to give ill-informed tax advice. I would like to actively seek partnership for this component.
Thank you for the feedback, I'm going to keep a list going of the most requested services. We can implement the ones with highest demand first.

Localbitcoins, although the premiums on price may make it only an option some of the time.
Fencing coins in-person will probably be a lasting way to launder coins with a dirty history. It would be unreasonable for the public to seize those coins as they behave like cash. Seizing coins due to their history undermines the premise of currency - and that is not in the public interest. 
Still, the receiver could be compelled to share information about the transaction.

This problem will not be solved until we can vote collectively in a trustless system. Proof-of-work decentralized mining as implemented in Bitcoin is the least bad solution. And when I say least bad I mean it in a "Einstein's theory of relatively is the least bad explanation of the observable universe." kind of way. 
There are theoretical issues with the implementation, that yes can lead to centralization. 
The double spend problem has been solved, but double voting has not. At least not in the digital context. Floridians might argue that it is still problematic in the analog context as well. 
There is a great amount of research being done to solve this voting problem, but there are many theoretical exploits to the proposed solutions.
The mining used in Bitcoin is effectively a very very good temporary solution to that voting problem. Just as drinking water is a very very good temporary solution to dehydration.
Until we solve the issue of double-voting, I don't think there will be a better solution to this problem. Fortunately, it's not a problem that needs to be solved right now as Bitcoin seems to be humming along just fine. If for example, the 51% attack is perpetrated and we have to revert to fiat or centralized crypto currency, it will just be for the length of time before we solve the double-vote problem.
The important part is that Bitcoin is an idea that is unprecedented. It is a technological achievement that is standing on the shoulders of giants and shining a gigantic laser-beam of innovation in every direction. There is very little if not zero incentive to conduct a 51% attack. If there is one attempted, it would cause temporary issues that could be swiftly sidestepped. If the attacker persisted, say with an FPGA farm, mining could be moved to a trust-based system as discussed at some points in this thread. Inevitably it would be fruitless to attempt a 51% attack, would cost an absurd amount of money, and would not harm the beautiful idea that is Bitcoin.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think bitcoins are only at risk to this vuln if private keys were generated on Android and then used to store bitcoins?

We typically quantify the Bitcoin network hashrate in hashes, not flops.
Regardless, here is the breakdown I have (at 100k diff):
1,000,000,000 hashes in a gigahash
90,000,000,000 hashes per second coming out of the foundation's avalon asic (90 gh/s)
100,000 * 1b = 100,000,000,000,000 = 100 trillion hashes per second on the network (100 th/s)
600 seconds in 10 minutes. 
For every ten minute block, ~60 quadrillion hashing computations are done by the network. That's a 6 with 16 zeros following it.
60,000,000,000,000,000 (60 ph/s) every 10 minutes
360 ph/h or 8640 peta hashes per day

I was hoping I could help shed some more light on the Core-dev guys. They don't get nearly enough recognition for their selfless hard work. 
Secondly, it would be nice to see more people take an interest in contributing to the core-dev efforts. 
The best way to do that right now (in my opinion) would be to start testing the Satoshi client's pull requests. Especially for features where several devs have said "this needs more testing".
Some of these new features are really cool, and you might actually like testing them!
If you are a python dev, please see this thread: 
P.S. Jgarzik is 100% right that the users really do have final say. If you don't like an update, don't run it. If you don't like the software your pool is running, move to another pool...

Yes, Gavin spoke about this a while ago. Bitcoin miners double as very efficient space heaters, water heaters, etc.
I believe it is why decentralized mining will eventually overtake centralized mining. For example, if you operate a large-scale mining operation - a huge amount of the costs go towards cooling the facility. That is unused energy and waste. Thousands of homes with Bitcoin mining water heaters would be efficient. That is what I hope will evolve.

For storing large amounts of bitcoins, I recommend running a system just for that. Meaning no downloads / web use other than connecting to broadcast transactions.
If your business stores bitcoins, or you own over $100k in local storage, it would be wise to invest in a thorough security audit. This should be done by someone familiar with Bitcoin who operates a reputable security firm. You may also consider purchasing insurance.
The only secure system is a system before it is hacked.

As mentioned above, if there were "clean coins" and "unclean coins" - we would quickly run out of clean coins. That is a ridiculous model that we have worried about for some time, and its advent is likely impossible. 
It is very easy to taint "clean coins" with the current protocol - so that would be a fruitless endeavor to pursue.
Please stop confusing "clean coins" with KYC'd Bitcoin addresses.

As for the public note, that could be anyone who wanted to send bitcoins to the exodus block address. Those public notes are a function of blockchain.info specifically:

Relative to other industries there are not many experts on Bitcoin, so I imagine they were impressed by something you've done. A lot of projects that NFPs take on take some serious debating and shaping - so it's good to have a group of people willing to discuss these various topics.

I think the quote you are referring to, and the one that has people upset is somewhat out of context. We are not looking to create a distinction for clean / unclean coins or even clean / unclean addresses for that matter. It is simple as you stated, creating a list of known addresses. This is something that has been thought about and worked on for years. 
BIP 15  is an example of how much this has been thought about. In fact, Satoshi himself originally thought about using IP addresses as an alternative to Bitcoin addresses, and it existed in the client for some time. 
There was even some work done by some prominent core devs to explore using DNS or email addresses in conjunction with or as an alternative. Ultimately the new payment protocol was developed: 
"Is this just about creating known addresses?" Yes
"Let's say I buy some coins on an exchange, and a couple hops ago they passed through some illicit site's wallet. Does your system track that?" No
"Am I going to be able to spend my coins with a company using your system?" Yes, I hope so
"Do I just have to send them to my personal known registered address first?" Probably, depending on how strict the company receiving them is about receiving coins from KYC'd addresses.

Bitcoin is a complex world unto itself. It is difficult to articulate all of its benefits in one sitting.
The main advantages in a practical sense are as follows:
-Send money around the world in seconds (compared to 3+ days for ACH / Wire transfer)
-Next to zero transaction cost ($.01-$.20 vs paypal's notorious fee schedule)
-Instead of merchants paying 2-3% to Visa/Mastercard for digital transactions, they can pay 0%

Key logging protection is a fallacy. Operating under the premise that your keystrokes are safe is probably less secure than being paranoid about it.
Downloading "keylogging protection" from a torrent site probably puts you in more jeopardy than not.
Running quality, highly reviewed malware/virus/rootkit protection that you purchase is probably the safest alternative. Also, Running a less popular operating system and sandboxing downloads doesn't hurt either. 
A good firewall on your system and on your router is definitely helpful as well.
