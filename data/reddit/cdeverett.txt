I tried to get out just over 2 BTC 13 days ago. Transaction sat at "Pending" all that time. 
Just noticed the site was down, went "oh..."
Hopefully someone here will know something, or it's just a temporary thing, but everyone in the chatbox has been fearing the worst as the mods advice remained the same - "cancel BTC withdraws, buy altcoins to withdraw"
Which in a worst-case scenario translates as "leave us the BTC, thx".
**Just hit F5 - it's back up** - time to look around and see if the tx is still stuck :(
EDIT - um nope, still down. I got the "please login" page but can't be sure if that was from my cache?

I know, I moved a pile of altcoins in on the 6th, sold, immediately withdrew the Bitcoins but they never arrived. I never leave coins out of my reach, this is infuriating

There was nothing slow about it, I just should never have deposited! Wrong time, wrong place

Just over 2BTC.
I'd moved a load of alts in, to get BTC out, in the first week of Dec. Thought I could spend a grand on a decent xmas, been out of work for a while.
Deposited, traded, hit withdraw... that's where the story ends. Didn't leave any sat there, didn't even log out and back in again between trading &amp; withdrawing. 
The small silver lining is that I didn't decide to dump *all* of my alts for festive spending. I might still have like $100, if that.
