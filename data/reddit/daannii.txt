Me.  And yes. Still holding.

I bet it was these people. 
You know.  Maybe.

That case is actually why I am asking these questions. 
From the legal papers filed, I am not sure what he has been accused of actually qualifies as money laundering.

So a tumbler can't be held accountable as a money laundering service unless there is proof that they knowingly were cleaning dirty coins.  Like emails ? Phone conversations? 
What would count as "proof"
Just because a known criminal has been using your tumbler doesn't mean you were in on it. 
That wouldn't be enough right?
I'm just trying to understand at what point the tumbler can be charged.

This may also circle back around to how did the FBI get the information about this guy?
Was it illegally obtained ?
They need to have proof that it was obtained in a legal manner.
From the information that is currently available about these charges, I'm not sure the FBI has a very good case against this man. 
I'm a little confused about the conspiracy thing too. 
Guess we will have to wait and see how this all plays out.
