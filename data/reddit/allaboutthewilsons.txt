It's almost as if hosting apps indefinitely through the cloud and allowing users unlimited downloads actually cost something.
Who knew!

Actually the daily cost of bitcoin is extremely important, or rather the volatility associated with that metric.  A currency whose value fluctuates as much as bitcoin isn't stable enough to be economically viable as a monetary instrument.
I've looked at bitcoin in the past, but each time I come back I'm left with the same conclusion, it's unstable, and unfit for use in the modern economy.
You guys need to clean house and stabilize the value of bitcoins before it can be considered a serious alternative to fiat currency.  Bitcoins fail for the same reason any currency experiencing massive fluctuations in market value fail.  Monetary instruments need to have stability.
Those that are losing value won't be accepted in trade for goods or services, because they won't hold value, if I sell you a house for $500k and tomorrow my btc is worth $250k, or even $490k, it's a bad deal for me to accept btc.
Those that are gaining value invite speculation, hoarding, and market manipulation.  Worse, why should I spend $50 in btc today when I believe it will be worth $60 tomorrow?
The bitcoin community needs to focus on stability.  Crypto currency is a cool idea, but it isn't ever going to main stream unless serious changes are made.

No it isn't.
The non-liquidity of bitcoin makes it a commodity, not a currency.

$17k in 20 years is literally pocket change.

But it's hard to buy.  Gold isn't.

I probably lose $18 every few weeks in currency conversion transactions.  It's literally nothing.
You can question whatever you want.  I am also free to respond.  Don't act like your rights are being trampled drama llama.

You act as if $18 were a lot of money...

But I can't get bitcoins.
