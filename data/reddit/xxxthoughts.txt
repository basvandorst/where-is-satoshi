Honestly i make a lot of assumptions like this and i know theyre not good to go off of but i consistently make money on them too much to be luck but not enough to be infallible. I shiuldnt be planting the seeds of my stupidity in people though

Because there is more bitcoins in circulation even though the individual coin is less, i think. Im fairly new to this

This is what i thought its good to know im not completely retarded, sold off at 3pm cause i figured people would get off work see thier "stock" went up 13% and sell it. I didnt expect a crash but i had a strong feeling of a decline

But i mean would it go down with the stock market as people lose trust and want to hold cash or will it go up (please exuse me i had a valid reason why it could go up and had a complete brain shart instead)

Thats what im saying since i havent been doing it very long its extremely easy to chart. But the fact that i havent been doing it long (6 months of day trading stock and bitcoin) could also explain why it hasnt bit me in the butt.

My theory is that people got off at 4 saw bitcoin was up 13% and sold for EZ profit. Kinda kidding kinda not

What do you mean by selection bias? As in im only thinking about the good times my assumptions paid off?(genuine clarification, reading over it i come off as douchey) Usually youd be right as i do that often but its quantifiable based on my results. ( although my results definitely may be scewed cause i havent been doing this for long enough so my sample size may be a little low)
