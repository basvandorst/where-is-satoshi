Well I see your accusation but it just isn't true, I really did send them 1btc (and 3.7 total so far) and theres even a video of me and then links back to my business card website, my linked in... and also a link from the newspaper story of my 1st donation ( &gt; [ )... I am putting my name and reputation on display, and you can believe me or not, but I do feel you, there are some $hitball people in this space.. but that really is their donation address and anything they receive will do a lot of good :)

Yeh I'm trying to get them to, showed them a unifcef page that was setup showing their donations address, but they move SOOOO SLOW, it took MONTHS even to get them to setup the first address and then be "allowed" to send them it, I then had to go into their office to help them too, there were letters from the trustees and the board and all sorts involved :P

Go get yourself a scan , if there's something it will show up. And pre-empt it, you don't have to live like a monk but just learn a bit about nutrition and be kind to yourself :) x
