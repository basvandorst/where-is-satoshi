To wash away your stupidity?

Miners mine BTC. So do you know where every single miner is located? Do you know their identities? No, because that's the entire point of btc, a trustless system. Wtf are you even on about? Do you understand anything about crypto?
For the government to regulate a decentralized system it would need to control the protocol. How else can it enforce its regulations if all exchanges occur on a decentralized exchange using a decentralized currencies?

Nah, I use that as a mainstream example. I mean an actual decentralized exchange where you wouldn't ever enter identifying information. Private and Public key cryptography would be used for user authentication, no recourse if you mess up, the whole 9 yards.

How is the US going to force a non-US company, who does not know the identity or location of it's users, to collect taxes on all of its US users? Just look at what IDEX is doing already. It won't be long before we have a trully decentralized, completely anonymous exchange. 
And fine, I'll concede that the government can implement certain regulations without centralizing crypto, but complete decentralization at both the coin and exchange level will render their regulations completely moot. Their only recourse will be to tax your fiat.

The government can tax you because you are declaring that you have (or are mining) coins. How would they regulate it if you don't declare it or convert it to fiat, without controlling the protocol?
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:35:25
How do you regulate something without centralizing it?

Hence the op mentioned decentralized exchanges, while the moron I answered to is asking for the government to do it for us. If that's what you want, there is regular stocks, bonds, and securities.

So join a non-us mining group and use a decentralized exchange.

Make a decentralized exchange and you don't need to rely on either the government or any corporation. What's more, they wouldn't be able to control it without banning entire internet protocols, including VPNs which would be used to circumvent that initial ban. The libertarian thing is fundamentally what crypto was founded and is based on, so if you consider that bullshit, you probably shouldn't be invested in it.
A trustless system puts the responsibility of storage, security, and anything else, including fraud prevention, on your hands. It is your responsibility not to get scammed, as nobody can help you in a decentralized system. You entered crypto because you hoped to make a lot of money but now want it's fundamentals destroyed because you got burned. No. The handholding you are used to from governments and corporations like Visa and PayPal aren't and never will be a part or crypto, and they shouldn't. Maths (i.e. logic) makes the coin, you are responsible to use that same logic in handling the coin. If you want safeguards, go to the stock market or invest in real estate.
 Your last paragraph is absolutely idiotic though, so I will not even try to reason with it.

Where is that money your moving made and who controls its supply. I guess central banks and governments are decentralized where you live. 'Decentralization through regulation' is the dumbest oxymoron I've ever heard in my life.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:45:46
What's the last time the government didn't overstep? Income tax was supposed to be temporary to aid the war effort, now the debate is only centered around how much we should be taxed. You have to do some serious mental gymnastics to believe the government will not overregulate crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:27:00
Fuck off with that bullshit. The entire point of crypto was to get away from central authority, not to centralize it with regulations and governments.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:43:42
Yes I have and it means [exactly what it says](
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:47:02
You call people who think government will solve all their problems naive or stupid, yet that is exactly what you are proposing with government regulations.

So you're David L. Smith?
