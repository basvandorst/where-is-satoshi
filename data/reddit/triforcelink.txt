I don't think Bruce intended to cause harm. However, when he did so, it looks like he blatantly ignored it (and there is no excuse for that)

NO! Bitcoin is an undervalued bubble..

I'm still sitting on the sidelines. For the past several months these quick upswings just ended up being countered by larger downswings. We shall wait and see...

IMHO Bruce is more of a victim of his own ignorance than a fraud. It's easy to screw up and then sweep it under the rug. Unfortunetely for Bruce, it's coming back to bite him in the ass.

I'm pretty sure that would only apply as long as people wanted get rid of the bitcoins they hold. As long as people want more of it, the price goes up.

Some drugs.

Because they made it easier for me to gain access to the things that I want.

The banks are not really giving out more credit than they have, if they were, they would be bankrupt. Instead I like to look at it as a smoke and mirrors trick which makes everyone's bank account look fatter than it really is. This allows banks to use money that would normally be sitting idle under someone's mattress.

Look at the chart since mid-June, the price looks like it has definitely bottomed out and is now starting to pick back up. It's such a nice smooth curve. As far as staying above $4, I'm guessing that we still might see the $3 something mark at least one more time.
