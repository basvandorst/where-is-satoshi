Are you willing to pay for it?

Okay I agree with the two alternative chains.
Yet, the fork could last a significant time if it has to rely on a manual choice, and possibly let new transactions be confirmed in the attacker chain; as the longer chain _is_ the bitcoin ledger, it means that even if many miners switched quickly, there would also be a significant rollback once they catch up the dishonest chain (that could have 1000 more blocks than the honest one if the attacker worked hard before publishing, btw).
Most importantly, the attacker could go on creating new blocks, thus preventing the small chain to catch up, even if all miners choose the short (and honest) chain. In this context, letting the miners choose a particular branch does not solve the problem. The only solution is to change the rule that "the longer chain wins". My proposition does that: it adds a rule that invalidates any fork before the last checkpoint.

To be fair, in a free market he would be allowed to try convincing people to leave ghash.io the way he wants.

Of course they can publish old blocks too, that is the beauty of this decentralized algorithms. Nothing prevents you to start building branches, a.k.a. forks, at an older block than the current one. It is just very improbable that you catch up the main chain so all your efforts (and money) will be wastes. That is why miners only build on the last block, but they don't have to! 
In conclusion, a wealthy and malicious entity could go back in time and build a completely alternative chain that they would publish instantaneously. If it happens to be longer (taking difficulty into account) than the legitimate one, the fake one becomes de facto the new bitcoin ledger and even honest miners will build on this dishonest accounting.

Thank you for your answer. Do you have any specific reason to believe that Colored Coins is still under active development, and will continue to be?

Thank you for your answer. I read this documentation already, but it is unclear how this passphrase actually works. Is it really just like an additional 25th word, or is it some kind of encryption? What do you mean by "without passphrase the seed is effectively encrypted"?

You didn't get my point at all, I'll try again. 
Say we are at block 1000, and US gov has been mining secretly an alternative yet long chain thanks to their 51% hashing power since block 900. They could kill bitcoin instantaneously by just publishing their long chain and changing the accounting since block 900. Having a checkpoint at 1000-N (say, N=10) would prevent them modifying the accounting before block 990.
So to answer your remark: yes, I'd prefer rewinding 10 blocks, that is, less than 2h, than rewinding .. whatever this fictive and malicious entity could have done that is larger than N.
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:23:09
I've been asking myself the same question for a long time. Andreas keeps saying that 51% attack is not a concern, but secretly creating a silent fork in order to modify a whole series of blocks instantaneously is definitely a possibility, at which point we would also need a consensus to ban the attacker one anyway (which would take time and be a disaster for bitcoin). So why not implement such a consensus preemptively? One could implement this rule for longer forks (say, 30 blocks), in which case the for is without a doubt one of an attacker. I can't see the downside of such an approach and don't understand why people hate it that much.

Thank you, I actually found the answer to my question:

Well, I read in the documentation that you can get the 24 words generating the seed. If you get the seed, you have the HD keys. I understand it's at the time of account creation only, but that's precisely what I want: get the encrypted seed at time of creation to store it securely.
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:44:46
I need to backup the seed and do not want it to be in cleartext as it could compromise the security of the wallet. I need some kind of two-factor security, either using encryption à la bip32, or by splitting the seed in multiple secrets. My question is: can Trezor output this information, or do I need to encrypt the seed manually (potentially compromising the seed)?
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:59:47
Oh indeed ;)
Yet, I don't like their solution very much: unless the passphrase is of very high entropy, it can easily be bruteforced as there is no kdf (like scrypt) to harden the 25th word.
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:01:27
Yes but this manual chain selection would create many forks, with a huge one between the users continuing with the long chain (that is, with the real yet broken bitcoin) versus the other ones, whereas my proposal automatizes the chain selection.

You may try to use a specialized software. The file is probably still readable on your harddrive, yet not accessible. I'm no expert here so I'll let other people answer on this point.
If your file is lost, then the answer is no, you can't recover your wallet.

"Devaluation" is used rather than "loss of value" by OP. Tragic -- and deserves "are you a retard" dixit killerstorm. Mr killerstorm is forced to read this nonsense post on reddit and lose time. Tragic. Thousands of people lost 10 minutes by reading this post like you, worldwide GDP is crashing. Tragic.
Dude, get a life. Your post would be valuable in explaining that "devaluation" is not a synonym of "loss of value" -- i did not know myself that devaluation implied official lowering by interventionism -- but you are so rude for no reasons that your message loses its substance. 
You don't like you downvote. Isn't it the precise idea with reddit? If this thread made it to the front page of /bitcoin, doesn't it mean people have some interest in this information? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:15:11
Seems like you do not realize currency pairs are symmetrical. EURCHF did indeed lose value. You're so rude, btw.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:11:31
SNB has forex reserves in its assets, and Swiss francs in liabilities (i.e. when you hold a Swiss franc bill, the central bank owes you some buying power). If reserves (i.e. assets) lose value, the central bank loses collateral value to the Swiss frank. Think about a Gold ETF that issues shares (i.e., owes some fraction of the fund assets to the share holder) and holds reserves of physical gold as assets: if gold value drops, the value of the ETF share drops too.
Also, printing Swiss francs definitely has a cost -- the cost of diluting the value of other issued Swiss francs with respect to the pool of underlying value. This is free for the central bank but not free for Swiss franc holders. To get the intuition, push the argument to the limit: if printing money were free, the SNB could print quadrillions of new Swiss francs to solve any economic issue. As you can guess, this is where hyperinflation shows up.

Thank you, BaurusdB!

Let me make something clear, as you seem to intentionally avoid to say it. One *always* gains or loses value *with respect to something else*.
The statement that EUR lost value is absolutely correct if your *unit of account* is the Swiss franc, i.e., EUR lost value *with respect to Swiss franc*.
There is no absolute concept of *losing value*, this is a relative concept with respect to a reference asset or pool of assets.
The only thing you can deduce from the title by OP is that he is probably from a CHF-denominated region as his unit of account is the Swiss franc. This is confirmed by the fact that he considers the pair EURCHF, i.e., Swiss franc denominated.
Also, I'll let OP answer to the rest of your comment, but I see no grounds for your accusation of the OP deliberately writing misleading information. You're either of bad faith, or you're paranoid. Or you just want to be rude, which seems to be highly probable too. OP seems to answer clearly to questions in this post, this is at worst a miswording. You're statement about what should be tolerated and what should not is dangerous. Who are you to decide what should or should not be censored? I can't believe I read something like this on Reddit.
So let me reiterate so it's very clear: the only critical part in the title is that devaluation is used wrongly as a synonym for "loss of value", whereas devaluation has a political connotation (i.e., devaluation means official lowering by interventionism). However, the *loss of value of EURCHF* is entirely correct.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:26:52
No. Using the word *revaluation* would be incorrect for two reasons, but I'm starting to repeat myself -- and also feel a bit ashamed to be the reason of you losing more than 10 minutes today.
Let me make this very simple.
1) thanks to you, I learned that devaluation (resp. revaluation) has a political connotation. Quoting wikipedia so that you don't suggest I am also a retard, *‘Devaluation’ means official lowering of the value of a country's currency within a fixed exchange rate system*. Make a pause here. *Within a fixed exchange rate system*. This does not apply to the case of EURCHF as it is now floating mostly freely. EURCHF is no longer pegged, that is, no longer in a *fixed exchange rate system*. So revaluation does not apply, dixit wikipedia. (let me say it again: dixit wikipedia).
2) the OP is very specific by mentioning the pair EURCHF. He does not say CHF, he does not say EUR, he says EURCHF, that is, euro *with respect to Swiss franc*. In this context, *euro with respect to Swiss franc* does indeed *lose value*, not *gain value*.
I hope I am clearer. To end this post on a positive note, I'm gladly willing to discuss it orally with you, if it could avoid me the hassle of losing 10 minutes reading insults in an interesting Bitcoin thread.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:56:20
The wording of OP is a bitambiguous. EURCHF dropped (it is what he calls "devaluation"), implying CHFEUR rose. CHF is worth more in terms of EUR (and most currencies) today.
