I like that, I'll have to check it out.

Mind blown. I gotta learn to use this.

Maybe it's a business phone and I only want to talk to people who know how to send me money. Perhaps I have software or information I can send their way if they are willing to pay for it.

Like I said above in response to some other comments, I don't envision something like this being used for personal phones and contacts. I'm thinking strictly business use-cases such as freelance work or as a filter system to prioritize bitcoin using clients over those who don't know how to send a bitcoin payment. You could potentially program the amount to be 1 satoshi if you like.

I agree fully. It would be a terrible idea to use a program/app like this on a personal line. I'm thinking it would be useful for a second phone that is business only. When that phone rings you know someone is paying for your time.

A 900 number that charges bitcoin would be a great idea. I wonder if that exists yet?  My vision is more focused towards filtering out those who value and can pay for your time/services and those that don't/can't(or don't know how to use bitcoin). Time is money if you have valuable information that others want/need.

That's pretty funny, I guess it would be a mistake to use on personal phones. I was thinking of a use-case for someone like a freelance programmer/hacker, journalist or anybody who provides a service that requires payment in bitcoin. If someone is willing to send a $1 in btc to get your attention then it shows that they value your time and know how to pay you for it.

I'm thinking it may be worth crowd-funding this idea into reality. Those who pay to fund it get exclusive access to the software and can share or sell it as they see fit.
