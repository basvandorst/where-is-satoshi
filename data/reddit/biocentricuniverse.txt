Woah ironically I immediately remember a notebook with only one page wrote with a completely random three word sentence wrote in the center of the page.. He was a genius (and all over the place) so he has a ridiculous amount of random items he's left me to be confused over if they're jokes or have deeper meanings.

It is a different man. He lost his girlfriend and son, so he relates to me heavily. We formed a good relationship, one that my fiancé would be happy to see me in. Oh, and I watched my fiancé fucking die in front of me, so yeah, I can assure you it's no lie that he's dead. Use your brain before you say disrespectful shit.

New to reddit, my mistake. It's MY bitcoins I put my money into it, he just handled the work and I never bothered to know how to access it because I never thought that I'd need to.

I'm unsure, if I knew the options I may be able to remember what he talked about and showed me

My fiancé and I combined our money and he did all of the work for converting it to Bitcoin and so far. He died 8 months ago, I have no clue where to begin to find the thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins.. Is there no hope?

It's crazy that my fiance had about $2,000 or so in Bitcoin in 2015 before he died and now it's increased in price so much that if I knew how to access his wallet, I would have so much money. Not trying to sound like a terrible person, I just know that he's thinking "wow, I wish I could tell her how to get that" too. Of course, I'd rather him just be here...

I can't remember. Maybe I have the name of it wrote down somewhere, but I don't think so. He kept it all very untraceable and everything he did was hidden in layers of codes. He would of told me, but I never cared to ask since he had it all under control.
