An average redditor should price herself for not being like the rest and for being smart to figure out what this bitcoin thing is.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:57:55


it has been part of every society, right? 
where capitalism differ is how you pool up capital and use it to exploit others
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:09:51


yeah, before capitalism they were
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:51:45
they didn't print money, they printed paper
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:40:37
if Venezuela printed money and saved themselves would it count as true capitalism then?
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:34:23
Corporate oligarchy is what you see in the US.
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:38:47
it is same as the US, only 
1) smaller
2) can't print money
@_date: 2016-04-28 14:58:57
Now I see, you do get that part about the bad side of capitalism but you think that was the price to pay for the good stuff we - the gold billion - have got out of it.
You also do not blame us  for that price because you think we do not have the maturity to find other ways to prosper.
My point is that prosperity in itself is poisonous and there will be no ways to get something material without exploiting others, so maybe I'm a true Christian (I'm not religious actually).
But logically I agree with Christ that the only way is to sacrifice and not to conquer. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:17:44
You avoided the part about slaves and arms (with the subsequently initiated wars around the world)
Apple and other IT giants have been many times mentioned as limiting free market competition
I don't really get where your definition is close to the theory of ideal capitalism (with free markets and valuable to all parties transactions )
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:39:38
they don't do real money exchange, don't they?
@_date: 2016-04-08 17:42:33
No need to go that far. You can just put in some bitcoin before going on vacation to Europe and have no problem paying there. Just know when to use what, like with everything.
Actually, debit card make a nice bridge into the world of 'normals'. That way they are less afraid of the unknown unknowns. So, I vet it useful in the transition phase.

You are right about crony capitalism but wrong about crypto.
You can vote with your feet (fork) only because it's early days.
Same was possible in the early days of capitalism when you would move over to America and start a "true" and "fair" capitalism society.
While the model assumes personal gains on expense of others, sooner or later a group will grab enough powers to exploit the system.
@_date: 2016-04-28 14:43:13


This is the problem. You don't get that wars and coercion IS the integral part of capitalism and IS the reason for all the advances it made. So you DO like the blood if you like the blood bathing.
Myself do not like what we've got because of capitalism - wars, global warming, terrorism and the prospect of a nuclear war. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:21:32

It'll only get worse as more unsophisticated users join Bitcoin. There will be more fraud and hence more forum posts. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 10:34:04
I know I can't undo years of capitalist brainwashing, but let's try.


If I pull out the rug under you when no one is watching and you fall, could I be blamed for that?
If I line-up many workers in the queue and tell them that I really need just one of them and the rest are free to go elsewhere (where I previously ruined the economy) and they start fighting with each other and lowering the costs, could I be blamed for exploiting their will?
This is exactly the trick capitalism has been invented for - move away from obvious exploitation, replace open slavery by the need to work for money. Ruin other economies to get cheaper workforce.
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:23:44

@_date: 2016-04-27 17:04:37
As you say the US isn't following the theory of capitalism. And it never did, unless you count slavery as being one of the "true" markets and arms as the other.
@_date: 2016-04-28 14:19:57
Societies before capitalism coped with individual protection much better.
Capitalism has been invented as a new way to break traditional economies without taking the blame. There is always that terrorist who killed that president and the subsequent war destroyed several nations and opened ways for transnational companies to start business there. Haha. Interesting to see delusioned people like you on even !!
Go start your $/BTC exchange  - you should have a fair right ! Hahahahahaha
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:44:18
The sustainability comes from the fact that a socialist country exploits itself but a good capitalists country like the US exploits the world.
The Venezuela problem is that they are small and have a limited exploitation abilities.

@_date: 2016-04-27 16:29:23
There are many good ideas, but not all of them end up being implemented properly, including capitalism.
In real capitalism a group of people is exploiting the poorer neighbours as this is a much more lucrative "business" than farming the garden.
In Venezuela the exploitation is limited as the country is small.

Now point to a country where it works like that.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:27:49
I just pointed that exploitation is an integral part of real capitalism, and capitalism itself has been born out of exploitation as the model, including using slaves for lowering down costs.
Slaves are still being used everywhere in capitalists countries.

from the comments:
If you want to invest short term into coins I agree with above statements. You calculate on the basis of traders and investors. That’s fine, but it isn’t accurate long term. The People supporting a coin make it what it is and if people want to use a coin, supporting businesses will follow – it’s free marketing and more customers after all. With many supporters comes a lot of innovation.
That in turn brings more publicity and thus more people that are attracted to it. And so the spiral goes. Bitcoin is a prime example for it.
Dogecoin has next to Bitcoin clearly one – or the? – biggest base of loyal supporters. They love their coin. Not just traders that move to wherever an opportunity arises, but gents &amp; ladies heavily in love with all the coin stands for. They don’t just move on if the value drops – as it did in the past. They are there for the fun &amp; message. If money comes with it, great. If not, so what?
And THAT is what a long term successful coin needs! Sure, it may crash more then once on the way to the moon, but that just means cheaper coins for everybody.

I think that's were you part with reality. This version of consensus is what the users want. Look out of the window - none of users is shouting for bigger blocks, they want SegWit and Lightning, isn't that not clear?
Just increasing the block size limit you bring nothing new to the table, only delaying the lunch. SegWit and LN deliver whole new kind of product - more powerful more user and business friendly.
Not miner friendly you say? Who cares
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:54:25
Original design of Bicoin didn't have the notion of pools and ASICs, so yeah, this is not how it was planned by Satoshi

It can happen the other way - US will ban a tx. The main point still holds - decentralization is key. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:14:17
So that's why there should be plenty of independent miners so that there will be always the honest ones and it will be difficult for the rest to unite.
This is clearly not the case ATM
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:50:55
Like I said, we have nothing to disagree about. You can continue your bullshit "for decades", I just go and use the privacy services of bitcoin to avoid the government crooks.

LN will take bitcoin to the next level, where there are new opportunities. You don't know before you try.
Simply increasing the block size is not giving any new opportunities. So no additional adoption nor decentralization.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:10:23
"Harder" is a subjective term. Is it possible? Everyone except miners want SegWit, so this is what the miners have to run to not get busted out by the community.

This is the worst thing in this manipulation. This is so obvious right now to the degree that at any moment in time THEY can set any price across all exchanges.
The mechanics are quite simple: either slow down the sell orders or buy orders depending on where you move the price.

So, as before, we have nothing to disagree about. People choose their way of doing things, if they like "security" they trust the banksters with their financial future, if they don't want to - they go and learn how to use bitcoin properly.
Privacy of bitcoin will help to avoid being robbed by the government crooks. When that many people start using bitcoin then we'll not need exchanges and risk will be much lower if any.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:09:19
Leave technicalities aside and you will get that. This discussion is not about scalability now - as the BU could have accepted SegWit and then - if not happy - forked.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:24:20
Honest miners (not the BU trolls) "do not want SegWit" only coz bitcoin was doing so well they were happy living in a dream of the blocks always full and fees sky-rocketing.
Obviously, the dream is over now as the price plummets, and they will need to take side.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:42:25
If you have decentralization your adaption can grow indefinitely.
On the other hand, if you grow adaption on the expense of decentralization, it will be much more difficult to decentralize later.
So again, decentralization is key.

In few years banksters realize how they failed with their "blockchain" experiments and understand how it is too late to get into bitcoin naturally. Will they walk away crying in tears? NO!
They stop experiments and adapt what's there already successful. They run a clone of bitcoin with a heavy premine. They give parts of the premine to various government crooks and media magnates.
They also use the premine combined with threats to take control over few - by that time it will be really centralized - bitcoin mining operations. Silently.
They announce Gov Coin as the true crypto, "protected" by banks, with some of the premine distributed to folks. People rave with euphoria coz they didn't have that many bitcoins anyway.
Crooks switch mining to their coin, leaving bitcoin with almost zero hashrate. Bitcoin price plummets, everyone starts using Gov Coin

It merely reduced the time it would take the Corrupt West to duplicate Japan’s economic suicide, and reduced that time rapidly. It’s now taken Japan more than 30 years to get to where it is today. It took the Corrupt West (and their psychopathic central banks) less than 1/3 rd that amount of time to do twice as much damage to their own economies...

@_date: 2017-03-19 14:41:58
Okay, I correct myself - Satoshi didn't expect that the majority of hashrate will be in one hands and people still continue calling it a consensus. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:19:37
So what exactly your wording hunt changes in what I presented earlier? The outcome of exchanges statement was not what the BU hoped for, but the Core have got additional support by having exchanges continue to support existing BTC ticker as the Core chain unless that chain completely fail - which will obviously not happen.
The BU is effectively treated - initially - as an altcoin and need to implement replay protection.

Your hysteria makes you look stupid. Using bitcoin properly means that:
* you understand that there are risks
* you know how to reduce risks
* you still think that government crooks are way more dangerous
PLUS you know that after some time when that many people use bitcoin for direct payments there will no exchanges needed that much
So, yeah. Do it on your own risk.
But the more privacy we get for bitcoin - the more people will trust it - the sooner we reach the goal of direct payments without exchanges

any proof that btc-e is shady? 
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:04:50
right, I wasn't clear what I mean. I correct myself to the following: with BTC fractional banking won't be effective and won't get out of control because even if there will be initial deposits and the bank will lend out 9 out of 10 BTC, these lended out BTC's won't end up in another bank. The reason is it's easy to keep BTC in your wallet and noone will take a loan just to put it back in the bank. So, no more levels of lending out of the same initial deposit will occur.
@_date: 2013-08-19 10:52:39

You don't understand that the banks/funds in Poland didn't fail - it was the government who just decided to grab a quick buck
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:31:23
from wikipedia: "The remainder of customer-deposited funds is used to fund investments or loans that the bank makes to other customers.[1] Most of these loaned funds are later redeposited into banks, allowing further lending."
I'm saying with BTC this scheme won't work as people won't take a loan in BTC to put it back in the bank because it's easy to keep BTC in your wallet, unlike cash. So, fractional banking with BTC is highly unlikely to create any noticeable effect and as such can be thought of as non-existent.

2) cheaper to make boards of chips and host them on site, for large companies like ASICMiner no need in pre-orders already.
3) if kept in China no need to move through customs, cheap electricity too.
4) only few very large companies continue to mine on bare minimum profits, yeah in China profits start at 1$.
5) Setup mining in different datacenters, like there are many miners, but in effect just few

ask your bank how much SEPA costs, it was 10 quid at LLoyds last time I send money to bitstamp (I payed 20 quid to not wait several days)
@_date: 2013-08-19 09:24:12
altcoins also don't come to the same level of centralization which will most likely be after bitcoin difficulty shoots through the roof - only few will run ASIC grids then.
altcoins are properly distributed and maintain the spirit of peer-to-peer economy, as more people switch from mining bitcoins to altcoins the net power will be sufficient to withstand any attack, especially considering scrypt as the alt algo

so the place for the first Venezuela billionaire is still open? 
@_date: 2013-09-01 22:22:32
Soon 99% of mining will be done by a few companies, fighting for thin margins. These will most likely be based in China - electricity is quite cheap, close to chip manufactures, also the real-estate and labor is cheap. On the other hand, even small profit makes sense in China.
1% will be the hobbyists who get older ASICs and have free electricity.

how so? is litecoin not secure?
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:21:36
Seems like people already care a lot about LTC, so you need to say "anything - that's also important already - could be important in the future"
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:16:29
They have the insensitive to create a coin and premine a lot.
We still don't know if all Satoshi's coins are gonna come on us in the future.

My SEPA transfer got lost more than a week ago, luckily not a big one.
@_date: 2013-08-31 17:21:26
Google balloons + solar-powered computers and we should be fine.
EDIT: unless all electronics get destroyed.
@_date: 2013-08-23 13:56:11
if 99% of miners destroyed some alt currency will take bitcoin's place

With $'s it works coz noone takes out the loan and keeps cash at home,
with BTC people will just transfer the whole sum to their wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:09:53
I've done a SEPA to bitstamp from lloyds about a month ago. You can also buy from people on localbitcoins or bitbargain.
@_date: 2013-08-24 17:39:56
If you buy shares you have no voice and you can be easily diluted. All mining companies IPO on btct or bitfunder - you get no protection.
 
You know what else isn't cool about companies? They do evil things and easily obey to government.
@_date: 2013-08-24 16:33:38
Faster technology - that's the catch!
As was explained many times, cost of hardware/electricity will be prohibitive for consumer products. Only large companies - like currently ASICMiner - will continue to invest. Others will be driven out.
In the end even government might start sponsoring some companies to keep control, if BTC goes mainstream.
EDIT: to those who downvote me - yeah right you believe in miracles, sorry to disturb your peace

it is no good economy if banks/government can throw it on the rocks either by installing/buying off most of the mining equipment or just by going after the few mining companies that will still be profitable one year in the future.
@_date: 2013-08-19 10:19:38
big miners are not invested in bitcoin if they are the banks and government

Bitcoin vs Alt coins dispute over ASICs isn't over yet. If larger companies keep increasing the hashrates driving out smaller miners, in about year time only few will mine.
Even if they distribute the hashrate between many independent customers, it is still just one entity susceptible to all forms of wrongdoings. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:17:17
And both most likely will be unprofitable

So, the banks protect us from us and charge for that, right? Bitcoin suggests to grow up, take control and be responsible. But it's too complicated for 99%, so lets go OccupyWallsteet istead.

FRB won't work with bitcoin:
1) 10 people give 1BTC each to the bank
2) bank loans 10BTC to someone, sending transaction to the blockchain
3) bank left with 0 BTC, it cannot give any more loans
4) end of story

That's not how business is done. You keep bitcoins at an exchange, convert them to fiat when needed.

BFL is scam in total, agree? :)
@_date: 2013-08-16 16:41:18
An interesting angle to the problem is with the infrastructure companies like exchanges that depend upon bitcoin economy.
They can start subsidizing people who buy and run ASICs.
For example, giving out free USB miners if you buy X amount of bitcoin from them. That will attract new customers and at the same time will expand the network.
@_date: 2013-08-19 10:57:52
thank you very much for your care, I'm staying with my eyes open not with the ears
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:14:06
why mining? China and other can just quietly buy BTC off-exchange for the useless paper called dollar they have got from the US

No need to track Nakamoto - it's a code name for one of the projects, started by NSA, currently known as Bitcoin :)
Seriously, NSA employed the best crypto talent, it's totally possible they developed the bitcoin

at this early stage hoarding only helps.
hoarding rises the price and that makes national news and that expands the network.

we can assume that by the time bitcoin mature,
many financial companies around it will process transactions "for free", being payed by their clients for the services they provide

The difficulty will top out when there will be a few about equal companies. Until then it will be possible to buy more/better hardware and eat someone's else share.

Basically, to get real profit you should be in the first 100 for any ASIC miner. The opportunity has gone forever.
