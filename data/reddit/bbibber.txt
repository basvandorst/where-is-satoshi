I am 100% certain you do not have any experience with that kind of money. From personal experience I can tell you it's perfectly fine to move that amount of money through bank transfers and plenty of very serious account holders do so every single day.
Your suggestion about 'the bank account getting hacked' is so wrong that I suspect you are mixing up with depositor's insurance which actually has nothing to do with individual accounts getting hacked but banks going bankrupt.

It's a good example of how neither you nor should go into stocks. Their operating income (which is what you can count on as revenues going forward) for Q4 is actually down from 9M to 1.5M and the only reason they made such a bumper earnings is because they got a tax benefit of 72M (which is a one-off gain).

The illegal part is in facilitating money transfer while not being registered as a money transmitter (which often carries high regulatory burdens like posting a hefty security bond). Charging more and doing larger transactions is going making it more likely you'll come under government scrutiny.

There is no guarantee that bitcoin is going to be cheaper if you want to avoid banks. For example, the buy/sell spread on bitcoins where I live on localbitcoins for confirmed sellers is 50EUR/BTC, which is really not that cheaper than your wire transfer. And a lot more hassle too!

24 hours seems like a good amount to get a feel of current hashing rate versus complexity. So let's take your observation of 8 minutes per block. 
Over 62 minutes we expect 7.75 blocks to be found. The chance of finding just one in that period is 0.3%, or about one every 300 blocks (approx 40 hours) Nothing impossible here.

Again, if someone buys BTC with $ then their $ liability on that account would go down with the same amount as their $ liability goes up on the seller's account. Whatever complicated trading schedule you throw at it their liabilities should always be equal to their assets unless they are paying out twice. Which they did with BTC but has never been reported for $.


$20M corresponds to 50k to 100k BTC but they only hold 2K (if all the numbers are correct) so we can rule that explanation out as well.
@_date: 2014-01-17 10:46:11
Actually, the Netherlands doesn't have a capital gains tax. It has a fortune tax. You are taxed on your assets, regardless if you make a gain or not. This is especially punishing in times of low returns like we are experiencing today.
For example, if you purchase a 10 year bond of the Dutch government, it will pay out 2.1% interest. But at the same time you pay 1.2% of fortune tax on that bond, leaving you with a net 0.9% interest or an equivalent capital gains tax of 57%(!)
Here's another example : you buy a stock for 1000EUR which rises to 2000EUR by the end of the year. You have to pay 1.2% on that 2000EUR (24EUR). The year after, the stock crashes to 1000EUR again. You have to pay 1.2% on that value (12EUR). By this time you have enough of the roller coaster and decide to sell the stock for 1000EUR again realizing zero capital gains. But you are still out 36EUR fortune tax!

If people had withdrawn $ then their $ liabilities would have gone down too. You can only end up with missing funds if you pay someone twice (as they did with BTC).

Why would working with dishonest miners be not almost too easy?
All it takes is someone starting a rogue pool and advertising it as such. Say it facilitates double spends, that it will pick up the "double spend" transaction over the original but you must include 5% extra payment in the double spend transaction to an address controlled by the pool (not as regular fees). Those 5% are then distributed as an extra incentive to entice miners to join the dishonest pool. 
It's a win for both parties :
The double spender has a higher change of "winning", and only pays the 5% to the dishonest pool when he wins.
The miners get 5% extra on top of what they earn through transaction fees.

Not really. His fortune is dormant so the market figures in the chance that the fortune is forever gone (mayby satoshi is dead, maybe the harddisk containing this money is gone). Let's say market estimate for that being true right now is 1%. As time passes by, this percentage can only go up because the only information the market has about Satisho is that he becomes older and more likely to die. Price will rise accordingly (because market estimates real supply is lower than theoretical supply). Then Satoshi spends 1 BTC. BAM. The market now knows he is still alive and adjusts its estimates on real supply immediately with a lower price.
TL;DR. Satoshi spending even 1 BTC will influence market severely not because of the direct impact on the order book, but because of the new information that trade gives the market.

Honestly, if an acceptable answer for the underpinning of the dollar is that 
a) you can spend them with the US government and
b) the US government will buy them back from you
then what's really underpinning the dollar is
a) the trustworthyness of the US government
b) the purchasing power of the US government
If that's an acceptable answer for Krugman, then an equal argument can be made about bitcoin that you can
a) use it to buy stuff from me
b) that I will buy it back from you
Here's my pledge : I will buy every single bitcoin (as defined by the current protocol) ever offered to me for a price of 1 000 000 000 000 000 (10^15) gold atoms per bitcoin.
Now, I very well understand that you'd trust the US government more to back up their claims than a random stranger on the internet. But that's just a matter of measure. Maybe you trust the US government a million times more than me. That just means the underpinning of the dollar is a million times more valuable than bitcoin. Fair enough. But the question has been answered.
Honestly, I believe the article Krugman linked to about Bitcoin being evil had a lot of merit that hasn't been acknowledged here by what seems a large number of posters who indeed buy into an ultra-liberal no-government ideology with their knee-jerk reaction to Krugman has been wrong before about something unrelated, he'll be wrong now (how's that for a dumb attitude and logical fallacy).
But the particular issue raised in OP's question and repeated by Krugman is just dumb on its merit alone : valuation in terms of what others will give you can be attributed to the dollar and to bitcoin in an equal way, just the measure between them will change (and adapt as things go)
PS. My above pledge amounts to a total underpinned worth of bitcoin of 21 \* 10^6 bitcoins times 10^15 gold atoms \* 197 gram/mole = (approx) 4200 \* 10^21 / (6 \* 10^23) gram = 7 gram of gold.

That's an absurd claim. People who have become wealthy through bitcoins recently just had the luck to be early adaptors in a snowballing system. Even if you call that intelligence, it's a fading advantage that's replicated in the non-bitcoin economy every single day and with much bigger sums. Only a very few have become wealthy through actual intelligent use of bitcoin like ASIC producers.

From your previous post (emphasis mine)


Maybe I misunderstood you, but you can agree that the use of the word become suggest 'growing rich'.
Anyway, if bitcoin merely allows you to better store your wealth then it is really not that interesting. Storing wealth is exceedingly easy and actually doesn't need that much wealth as you seem to suggest.


Of couse, bitcoin is really not that interesting to a government. Surely you see why they haven't immediatly jumped to put in place the same protocols against money laundering, tax evasion and illegal goods transactions they have for the other part of the economy using regular currency which is not one, but multiple orders of greater magnitute.
Once Bitcoin grows large, there is nothing there to prevent the government to make it as much a target as fiat money. And yes, there will be people getting away by hiding their bitcoins from the government, just as there are now people hiding away their fiat wealth from the government.
Personally I am still not convinced that bitcoin is special in the 'anarcho-stick-it-to-the-government' sense some are claiming. Bitcoin is different because it is a full information system : you can trust it not because someone says so, but because every single participant can verify it and check the underlying mathematical suppositions. That's what radically different with bitcoin. Not that it is currently so small that is flying under the radar of the government.

Unfortunatly the return address is something the seller chooses. Current practice is to pick a public building, the address of a lawyer, etc. 
But even if your seller would only use personal addresses, that can be data mined too. It's fairly easy to see if a return address belongs to a likely ebay seller, because then it will show up in many private 1 to 1 transactions. However if you receive most of your packages with a return address that's not likely an ebay seller you could get flagged again.

The problem with consuming less is that it also discourages progress. Why would Toyota ever develop that Prius OP talks about in the first place? Remember that at first it wasn't cost effective and Toyota relied on a larger body of first adopters who don't mind paying extra because they have spending money. Drastically reduce those due to deflationary pressure and what you get is indeed an economy that uses less resources. Not because it is more efficient, but because it biases us to a lower standard of living. What we actually want is an economy where spending is encouraged but (environmental) waste is financially penalized. Exactly the opposite of a deflationary economy.

Interesting idea. Are there economically developed countries where the public opinion would tolerate such a heavy hand from the government?
A major technical problem would be international trade. More specifically how would a citizen book a hotel room in another country. Or how would a company pay for an international supplier?

Insider trading has a severe cost associated with it. Those that are not inside are, obviously, at a trading disadvantage if there is information others may use that they certainly never wont have access to. Therefore it might make them decide not to invest in a venture that they would otherwise invest in. This is obviously contrary to the purpose of a trading market : to allow the public outside to fund bussinesses. A lower overall investment participation is means an underperforming economy and a huge loss in wealth generation.

No offense, but you are a walking example of the biggest structural stumbling block potentially holding it back : that the public at large isn't ready to deal with bitcoin yet. And you are at least somewhat knowledgeable.

Well, this is also voluntary. Shops can opt to do the check and send their data to them or they can opt not to. That's the problem with this scheme : there is nothing anyone can do to block this scheme, you can at most make it less efficient by refusing to send the data.

Return address is part of the metadata too. Normal packages ordinary people receive are from online retailers with a known return address. When you receive one package from a silk road seller who puts a random government building as the return address, it could be you received your officialized divorce statement. When you receive many of those packages you get flagged. When some of these return addresses are really weird (like from a bureau of child services but you have no children) then you get double flagged.
Order enough from the silk road and eventually you will fit a pattern. Don't underestimate the power of data mining. It's frightening.

Of course not. Nevermind the toll on productivity if we had to have a security firm for every elderly couple living alone. Nevermind those elderly people not able to afford such a service.


Of couse not. That's exactly what I am saying. That one principle doesn't apply everytime. My solution exactly calls for a society looking back and forth what works. Sometimes that means regulation, sometimes that means free market approach.


Their own. Yes, and? Again, the point you seem to be missing is not how the enforcement works, but that the enforcement breeds trust and therefore lets trade grow.


I am not sure how you distill that out of what I said. It feels like we are talking besides one another.
@_date: 2013-07-27 07:12:47


A majority of voters have parents who they would like to continue living on their own. Stories about scammers and high sales pressure people targetting the elderly always get a lot of sympathetic press. Many people have also been subject to high pressure sales themselves. It seems that kitches sales people are the worst in this aspect in my country. And finally nearly everyone has/knows a kid who subscribed themselves to some kind of texting service where they get sent daily ringtones and that are impossible to get rid off and rack up bills like crazy. That's why the law has been changed a few years ago specifically to limit the predatory nature of these sellers. They pass without any controversy at all.
You've asked me all these questions and I don't mind to answer some more if you like. But care to share your own view?


But that again is one principle that overrides every situational circumstance.  Maybe there are genuine reasons to have a coercive economic actors in some situations.


As I said, it's more an appeal to show the exceptionalism of your point of view rather than an argument itself.


That's a very good example. But if we start to deconstruct what 'peaceful' really means then you'll see that you start nuancing. For example you are out with your 4 year old daughter. A stranger approaches her and gives her candy. You ask him to stop since you don't want your kid to learn that it's ok to accept candy from strangers. He refuses and continues to offer her candy. At what point does his behaviour switch over from peacefull to not-peacefull. I am sure the limit is different for everyone and I am sure I can continue feeding you situation where you have to bring in nuances to define what exactly remains peacefull. The exact same thing applies to abstract principles like 'freedom'.


I should have been more clear. I didn't use failed state as an example of anarcho capitalism. I just used it as an example for a situation where there is little or no capacity for coercive enforcement.
Note that I am not arguing for or against anarcho-capitalism per se. My point in this thread specifically is that coercive enforcement builds trust which increases trade.


I think you misunderstand the nature of these bodies. Many of them have binding supranational powers so that their decisions automatically  become enforceable in member states. Nevermind that I personally didn't sign up from let's say the EU, just as I didn't sign up for the the government where I currently live but they both bind me just as well.
But it's actually irrelevant for my point which is that trust based on enforcement increases trade. Trust from individuals that they can enforce their rights in other countries through a coercive justice system in that other country is what increased trade. Supranational organisations and agreements put that coercive system in place. Yes, it was based on mutual agreement, but from the point of view of the individual (which is what counts, right) it was just as much based on mutual agreement as our governments. That is to say : each individual got one vote, but no-one got a veto.


It may suprise you, but yes, the free movement of goods and services part of the EU still has wider support,  and it's actually the one thing that keeps a lot of the mainstream to seriously start taking steps at breaking it down.

The problem with your transaction volume number is that it also contains money that's moving from address to address without being part of an economic transaction. For example a merchant moving to/from cold storage. Hard to tell how much that is but I wouldn't be surprised if it is significant.

Where I live, any sale to a private person except a few exceptional items (mostly perishables) can be reversed by that private person up to 3 days. Any door-to-door contract (don't know the real term in English) can be unilaterally disavowed up to 7 days. Any service or subscription sold to a private person has strict limits set on the way it can renew itself. This drastically cut down on these practices. All the above are rights recognized to individuals by law. Any terms in a sales contract that try to limit these rights are automatically void and unenforceable as well. 


First of all, you go from my position that it lowers trade to 'it becomes impossible' in one sentence. The tendency to think in extremes is ripe in fringe economical circles, but it's obviously not just a dishonest discussion technique, it also may give you a skewed outlook on reality where very few things are, in fact, extreme.
If you allow myself to make a sidestep. Given the diversity of the human race and the diversity of our interactions, is it really plausible that one overall guiding principle is always the 'right' one? Doesn't it make more sense to you that depending on the circumstances sometimes different principles and different rules are better suited to the situation? That in some economic transactions indeed more freedom is better, while in others more coercion has better results. I don't really expect this observation to convince you in itself, but if you think about it in your personal life : do you always react in exact the same way? When you speak of your new girl/boyfriend do you say the same things to your sweet grandmother than your friends? Just food for thought.
On to the argument itself then. Domestic trade is indeed much bigger than international trade. And international trade with partners that have a strong justice system is generally much bigger than with failed states. And finally, governments do organize in supranational bodies (NAFTA, EU, WTO, ASEAN, ...) many with the specific intent to increase global trade and governments are willing to accept binding arbitrations from many of these organisations. It's actually the number one area where the EU as an organisation has been fantastically effective, despite the massive amount of red tape it added to doing business.

Austrian economics proscribes inelastic _total_ money supply. It is relevant wrt bitcoin if you think that bitcoin should indeed be the only currency. For those who see bitcoin as an addition to fiat money, not a replacement, linking us to Austrian economics is false, pushing an agenda and certainly not neutral.
Most merchants currently accepting bitcoin are like that : they see it as a convenient (fiat) money transfer that supplements their cash flow in fiat currency. They are perfectly at ease working in an economy with an elastic money supply and may even want to keep things that way.
My vote is for removing all non-bitcoin community links.

Sorry you are deluding yourself.
People still can and will steal your Bitcoins. Given the current state of (computer/home) security it's trivially easy to steal the average person's bitcoin. Much easier than for example emptying his bank account. And when people do steal your bitcoins, you are on your own. Contrary to when someone empties your bank account through for example PIN skimming in which case banks often will make you whole again. 
The government can still seize your bitcoins. There is one documented case of that already happening. Sure you can refuse to give up your bitcoins in which case they'll eventually come in through the front door and help themselves to your keys. Failing that, they'll just throw you in jail.
People will and do charge fees on your BTC. Sure you can avoid them by not doing business with these people, just as you could avoid doing business with banks. But how's that any different?

Yes, but if bitcoin is just one of many currencies operating all together in the same economy, then what the bitcoin inelasticity says nothing about how money in general behaves in that economy.


Well, then we shall agree to disagree. Valuation is the direct result of a transaction between two parties.

Well, my wife is an ob/gyn. From the patients she see with heartbreaking infertility stories right through the babies (and mothers) they, luckily, very rarely loose, it made me keenly aware that we can't have progress enough.
Because make no mistake, the same progress that drives us to cure mankind from these blights is the same progress that makes you and me reply reddit on a train. Or even, makes something like bitcoin possible in the first place.
Yes, consumption has its darker sides and the ones you call are actually very mundane and on a larger scale not that important. What about the hundreds of thousands dying in car accidents every single year for example. But even that darker side doesn't outweight the simple things like getting rid of smallpox, measles and in due time sunstenance farming and HIV.

Any police investigation worth their salt will let a few packages through first. And bust you on the fifth so that when  you say : "_This wasn't for me_" they'll just retort : "_Then why didn't you report the 4 earlier packages sent to you containing drugs?_" 
See : this is why people get caught. They think, just as you, that they have a good defense and are happy to share that defense with anyone. But in reality they don't know all the facts and they end up with a conviction.
If you get caught and you know for certain you are guilty, don't start explaining, not to reddit, not to your friends, not to the police. Not a single thing. No matter how proud you are of your explanation that can 'explain everything'. Shut up and get a lawyer.
