You underestimate how quickly the fork would resolve. I bet it would happen in less than 6 hours.

How are people supposed to support something before it has has a champion promoting it? Gavin and Brian are heroes in my opinion. Core is betting the future of Bitcoin on untested technology and censoring anyone who disagrees. It's deplorable.

Ditto. What you said

Let's do it
@_date: 2015-12-31 10:06:02
In computer science we have a thing called the robustness principle. It basically states "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept"
This is basically the mantra of bitcoin unlimited. I see nothing wrong with it. It's far from the chaos that will ensue when 1mb blocks fill up.
@_date: 2015-12-28 08:43:48
He's not wrong. Coinbase, as an organization, makes significant contributions to the Bitcoin world. It should be allowed to experiment and even evangelize if that's what it takes to save Bitcoin's future.
To remove them from bitcoin.org over a tweet regarding healthy experimentation is an unfortunate abuse of power.
@_date: 2015-12-31 21:51:51
Those sound like absurdly optimistic deadlines for a proposal that is so complex and new. Look, I really like SegWit. It makes sense to me to split out the effect of the transactions from the proof that they are valid. It allows the different data to be handled differently (i.e. pruned once no longer needed).
That said, this feels incredibly rushed. SW does not strike me as a good substitute for increasing the block size.
My preference would be overwhelmingly for SW to be implemented as a hard fork. Squishing it into the coinbase transaction as a soft fork makes it even more complex and adds technical debt, imo. It just feels janky.
@_date: 2015-12-30 05:04:20
Finally, some people talking sense. Cheers to Jeff and Gavin!
I'm still in favor of BIP101 fwiw.
@_date: 2015-12-31 21:25:09
Given the bip is just now being published in draft status, why are we counting on this as the solution to blocks filling up?
I believe SegWit is a silly way to increase the block size limit anyway. Let's just call it what it is, a malleablility fix and a first step towards pruning.
@_date: 2015-12-31 18:32:54
The 25% will quickly surrender. The economic incentives are too great.
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:17:18
I have looked at the code, but I still don't think the pros and cons have gone through enough scrutiny. Even if the code is fully working, it still needs to be battle tested and hardened before deployed to production. This can take months to years. 
Before that happens however, the proposal still needs to be examined for structural weaknesses by computer security experts. I haven't seen any published reports documenting that this has been done.
@_date: 2015-12-31 06:31:51
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:16:58
This just isn't true. The proposal removes signature data from affecting the merkle tree that ends up being hashed. This means the magical "block header hash" that has to meet the difficulty requirements no longer references signature data for SegWit transactions. With SegWit, you no longer have proof of *which set of signature data* was included when the block was verified.
The implications of this need to be studied carefully and explained to the community before it's deployed.
EDIT: I'm looking further at it now, and it appears that there is a a mirror merkle tree that is included in the block hash header after all. In any case, SegWit needs further study IMO, and won't help enough in the next 6-12 months.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:09:56
Then they can publish small blocks. If they can't keep up with larger consensus size blocks, too bad.
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:48:56
One of the chains will die.
@_date: 2015-12-28 09:31:17
The con is that you no longer have signature data in the blockchain. At the very least, you now need data from more places to replay for yourself the whole truth of what happened. It hasn't been explained to my satisfactiom what risks this introduces into the system. Perhaps someone can clue me in. I estimate SegWit to be perhaps halfway through the dissertation preparation stage of a PhD. To take it for granted as the solution to an immediate threat of blockchain logjam is inappropriate, naive and nearsighted at best. 
I think that once it's proven out, SegWit will be a welcome addition to the scaling bitcoin arsenal. It doesn't do nearly enough at the moment.
I believe Bitcoin can handle and was intended to handle much larger blocks. It's in everybody's best interest to have much larger blocks that can support many more users on Bitcoin proper.
@_date: 2015-12-31 23:58:38
Old clients will not understand these confusing (from their perspective) new transactions. There won't be any signature data contained within them.
Core is arguing this is okay somehow.
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:13:54
LN doesn't exist. I don't see it in production. Any coder will tell you it's not real until it's deployed. Bitcoin core is behaving despicably.

You should try to play up the potential economic benefits to them. For example, Mexico's economy is roughly 1/3 driven by exports and foreign imports, mainly with the US. Bitcoin has the potential to help make those sorts of business transactions more efficient on all scales, from a small food purchase to the largest oil deals.
If money laundering is their big fear, then they may take some solace in the fact that the ledger is permanently public. This makes following the money much more feasible.
As far as credible supporters, you can reference Marc Andreessen, Bill Gates, and Benjamin Lawsky NY State Superintendent. Lawsky has had success tracking down Standard Chartered Bank's illegal dealings with Iran.

It touches many parts of consensus code (read: mission critical). It needs to be done with great care, and shouldn't be rushed.
@_date: 2016-01-22 01:46:33
Count me (one technical mind) in the Jeff/Gavin Camp.
I think Core has some brilliant ideas, but they are way too afraid of hard forking. Hard forking is something that will need to be done many times. The cost of lessons learned is increasing, not decreasing as time goes on.
The fact that Core finds a softfork of SW as the most sensible and least risk capacity increase is very disheartening. SW, while theoretically very simple, is still an involved change that affects the Bitcoin block format and many systems at many layers. SW should not be rushed, and we shouldn't be counting on it for our near-term needs.
Btw, SW is a neat accounting trick, but really inappropriate as a scaling solution, IMO.
I'm of the belief that we should let the market decide the block limit, rather than a hard coded parameter. Believe me, miners won't publish blocks that are bigger than necessary, as they are the ones risking increased orphan rates. I'm actually really disappointed with the mining community for giving their voice and votes to Core.
Ultimately, Core has really done a poor job of listening to the community, and of giving businesses a clear roadmap of understanding (on-chain) Bitcoin capacity.

It's not about me being offended. It's about developer priorities. I don't believe the current dev team has the right priorities for bitcoin to succeed.
User experience matters. Tx cost matters. Confirmation time matters. 
Sure, decentralization matters too, but it's not been shown to my satisfaction that larger blocks harm decentralization. I'd argue larger blocks would attract more entrants into the ecosystem and actually improve decentralization. Bitcoin just isn't very interesting to new entrants at its current scale.

fun fact: hedges do not need low volatility to do their job.
hedges are intended to be anti-correlated with an original asset. i.e. they tend to move in opposite directions. Due to this property, adding a hedge reduces a portfolio's overall risk, even if the hedge is very volatile.

what a healthy and ROBUST fee market. Blockstream must be so happy!
@_date: 2016-10-07 07:23:44
I take it you're okay redlining our small-block bitcoin engine for years. That's one strategy. 
I prefer a different one. Making more space available reduces confirmation times and keep fees low during these critical early years. There's plenty of block reward left--decades of it. There's no need to maximize fees now. Let's create as many Bitcoiners as we can instead.

That works for now, but doesn't scale up the number of users that can use Bitcoin. Nor does lightning btw.

I'm sick of the "higher fees solves everything" argument. No it doesn't. If you don't have enough space for new users, then you don't get to have new users. Fewer users means the network effect doesn't get to work its magic and it hurts the exchange value of BTC. All of this so we can protect an artificial arbitrary 1MB block constraint that was meant to be removed all along.
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:37:52
Small blocks =&gt; greater decentralization is the biggest myth alive in bitcoin. It has done immense harm.
@_date: 2015-11-13 01:56:58
The security depends on total transaction fees. That equals # transactions x $ avg fee. I think we should focus much more on increasing the # of transactions.

Yes, and Coinbase has supported BIP101 in the past. I think we as a community need to bite the bullet and accept that BIP101 is the only solution that kicks the can down the road far enough. The other options will run into issues rather soon.

LN is great, but the security model is worse than bitcoin's. You're required to stay online to monitor your counterpart and refute invalid txns. With bitcoin proper, this is not required. Offline security!

Anyone can spend transactions are a huge hack. The soft fork after soft fork strategy spits in the face of the bitcoin community, telling them "we don't care what you think or want. You get no say. We're the devs and we know best and since we've got the miners under our thumb, you can't do anything about it"
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:19:36
And more fiat dumped for bitcoin (in order to use this). Liquidity in both directions is exactly what bitcoin needs.
More liquidity leads to more stability leads to more trust leads to more value. After all, money is just quantized trust.
In any case, every integration like this gives bitcoin more public awareness and credibility.
We're seeing the network effect in action and it's a beautiful thing.

I don't like it. My first impressions are that it complicates the blockchain with no clear win. 
The claim is faster, more powerful first confirmations than bitcoin core does today. However, under bitcoin-ng, as I understand it, there's no way for a miner to close out his block. This implies that there's no way to know if any of the elected miner's microblocks will be included in the final chain. This is no more effective than 0-conf transactions today. In bitcoin-ng miners rely on the next "key" block to build off of their lastest microblock. Again, there's no way to guarantee they'll do this.
To me, bitcoin-ng hasn't demonstrated real benefit. Its "first confirmation" isn't much more than a 0-conf transaction of today.
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:27:52
But but Blockstream's sidechains won't be as needed. No wait, decentralization will suffer. Wait, my friend in Africa with a 56k modem will be kicked off the network. No, wait, hard forks are scary.... oh, we don't have consensus... I just know there's a reason we need to stick to 1mb blocks... Somewhere. /s

Agreed.  Requiring 95% is saying 5.1% can hold the network hostage since they can block a fork with overwhelming support. In the messy real world, I can't imagine a system that rejects proposals with 92% support is a good thing.
