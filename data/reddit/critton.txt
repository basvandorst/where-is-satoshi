Yeeeeahhhhh, was hoping for a more secretive option, but my buddy would be the best bet. Wasn't for a matter of trusting or not trusting him so much as just wanting to be private. I'll try some dickering with vpn's and such first, but the friend is a good back-up option.

Thanks for the advice.
 As to the passport, probably be a good idea if you were on a non-combat rotation to an ally/NATO country, somewhere where you can actually go out and explore for fun... but no, not really necessary or advisable when you're on a combat rotation somewhere you only ever leave the base for missions. It'd just be one more thing that could be stolen/go missing to be worried about. If you're taken by a friendly, it won't be hard to contact your unit. If you're taken by an enemy, you're not supposed to give them anything but name/rank/selective service number.
Even doctrine aside, your passport/driver's license generally has your home of record address on it.... Which for many people, is their parent's house. If they've bothered to change it, then the new home of record address is probably their spouse/kids' house.. So in a war where the enemy uses the internet to recruit and indoctrinate globally, and encourage attacks as much as possible, you really don't want to have that info floating around. Packages from home, you cut the addresses off and burn them before you throw the boxes away, a lot of little stuff like that.

Thanks, can't really leave the base I'm on to track down a local buyer, but I appreciate the answer.
