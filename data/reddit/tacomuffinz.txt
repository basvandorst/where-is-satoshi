Here is another example since your using btc 
Before fees .08437
Arrived @ .08387
That’s .001 btc
.82 lol they’re gonna have trouble giving us discounts with their token because it’s cheap and here you are actually thinking one will charge you 20k to pull out 100k. THAT MY FRIEND IS RIDICULOUS lmao!
@_date: 2019-10-21 11:54:54
I like your thinking :)
@_date: 2019-08-09 03:34:27

@_date: 2019-08-09 03:28:51
LOL! BCASH BRO roger ver swears its tha juice!
@_date: 2019-10-05 03:36:58
I withdrew 1k and it cost me less than a dollar. I guess maybe smaller increments it wouldn’t be worth it really
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:38:29
I agree I jumped ship from Gemini when they tried their slick new noob layout with higher fees....now I can withdraw my coins and buy without fees. Super dope! I can’t wait for more discounts and perk once they rebrand their token
WE SHOULD NOT BE PAYING TO BUY WE SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR CHOOSING  TO USE A SERVICE. Welcome to 2019!

@_date: 2019-10-05 00:12:37
Where are you getting your info? Correct me if I am wrong as we are all on the same side here 
My last LTC withdrawal of 16.36886 LTC 
Before fees 
Arrived in my wallet as 16.35886
That’s .01 which is 57 cents currently in ltc how is 57 cents 20% of 16.36886=$963 at the current price
Please elaborate.

This is awesome and exactly why BTC will be so valuable LTC fees are very manageable too ;) especially with the SWIFT  restriction with iran people still have power!

@_date: 2019-09-30 22:52:40
I agree completely I’ve been using Gemini for a while and when they changed on me I had to sent a support request and ask for it.  Oh well people will catch on or most* I should say. Give them time!! I use voyager right now fees are tiny
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:08:33
