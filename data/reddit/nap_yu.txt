Development of Bitcoin is around a set of proposals ([BIPs]( The development of some BIPs has been done, but their dates of being available to the public are still unknown. It is because adopting any new feature requires the consensus of the whole community, which usually can't be 'planned'.
On the other hand, stability/robustness of bitcoin has become the priority, which means the community has become much more careful and conservative in adopting new features. This doesn't imply that the users of bitcoin will not have a specific feature that other crypto might have. Instead, those features might appear on layer 2 development like Lightning, RSK.

If so limitted number of hashpower owners can determine bitcoin, you must go to fiat, which truly runs in this way.

It is not about 1mb or 2mb but the consensus process, which resides in the core of decentralization. Any change to the bitcoin protocol must follow the consensus process. We likely eventually will go to 2mb, but NYA is a closed door agreement between just a number of cartels, without the consensus of the wide community. Furthermore, the 2X guys has recklessly refused to add replay protection, which will cause users to lose their investments, so they're the terrorists among the bitcoin community.
