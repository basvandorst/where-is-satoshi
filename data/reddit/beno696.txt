Jesus. Why is the bitcoin subreddit riddled with hate and negativity.  It never fails me to go on bitcoin or bitcoin mining and seeing such a rude community. Its supposed to be about improving bitcoin technology not criticizing people.

Exactly! I cant stand it. I usually browse litecoin or dogecoin because of that

Exactly!  I hate browsing this sub. Its full of so much negative comments.  Its about improving technology not about getting tips or criticizing people.

I am a bitcoin miner. I mainly did it for educational purposes.  This subreddit isnt very friendly  with help. They usually shut you down and say "its no longer profitable." That is true, but it has helped me understand the mining process much more.  Firstly you need a dedicated piece of hardware. I have gridseed asic 5 chip dual miners. Check them out on ebay. Got them for 14 a piece. Then you need either an embedded pc or your own pc to control the software that runs the hardware. You will need whatever software your hardware will support. Then you need to join a mining pool. If you have any questions message me!

Thanks for shaming that business for promoting a new technology.  Prick

I am not necessarily ashamed with being associated with the r/bitcoin sub, more angry. I am extremely passionate about bitcoin and new technologies. But when I come across users criticizing creativity and being outright rude to newcomers I become very upset. This sub is very poorly moderated. Some kind of change is needed.
