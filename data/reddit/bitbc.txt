as much as people may like to see that, it's never going to happen. You can't blindly say they're ridiculous when they protect you in a huge amount of ways.
The majority of humans want more things for their kids, bigger houses and nicer things. Once you have that you have people wanting to get rich. Once you have that you have people trying to con others to make money. These regulators who you call ridiculous try and protect you from those conmen. You need them!

So you didn't check the spread on the exchange when you started? That's like walking into a currency exchange with 100 Euros, trading them to GBP and then back again to Euros and wondering why you have less than you started with?
No offence but you're a moron!

I imagine the father of bitcoin has a pretty solid method of storing his coins.
What would be interesting is if he leaves the private keys in his will to his children. Clearly the man has no interest in the money himself but his children might.

You can see where he's coming from if your viewing it from a commodity only viewpoint. I think he's missing the massive potential Bitcoin has as so much more.

That wouldn't matter though, if they know what everyone had (cash and bitcoins) then they could easily check their balances over that. If those are going up then fine and dandy, if not then something is seriously wrong.
They had very few costs in that regards so it should have been going up and up. I just can't fathom the level of incompetence here!

yep he was brilliant, seemed very confident as well. Confident enough to tell the chair he was completely wrong on a couple of points.
I think the reason Andreas is so popular in the community is he's so articulate. I've learnt 90% of what I know about bitcoin from him and he makes it incredibly easy to digest.

I'm not going anywhere believe me. But that's because I understand the tech behind bitcoin. My concern is the lay person doesn't and this could be enough to scare people off. Front page of Fox News - 
Long term I hope these events stop happening but people like Karpeles should not be handling that much money. 
The sheer level of incompetence is mind boggling. They were literally doing no internal auditing whatsoever and they're handling millions of pounds. That site should have been dead and buried years ago.

Yes the internet made crime easier, yes no surveillance makes crime easier and no anti-money laundering rules make crime easier. While we may be over-surveilled now over what we do over the internet, that is not an argument to say there shouldn't be any surveillance at all.

I don't agree. Each time more people are getting burnt and if the demographic is changing then the newcomers are people who know less and less about the technology.
If people continue to get burnt then they're less likely to get back in on the game especially if they're clueless on the tech. The numbers of people like this will grow exponentially with each incident leaving you with a core group of users that you had a year or so previously.

One idea is to split your key in half, give one half to someone you trust and another half with someone else. Repeat several times to reduce points of failure.

Andreas - if the situation was down to their incompetence with the transaction malleability could it have been avoided if they were taking these simple steps?
1 - Watch only on their cold storage addresses 
2 - Monitor their hot wallets 
3 - Check in the bank and see how much cash they had 
4 - Count all the bitcoins in circulation and cash in peoples' accounts on the exchange.
5 - Perform a really simple sum and see if the amount of coins and cash they own is falling or rising each day. This could be on a big screen in the bloody office.
Would it have been that simple? You would of thought someone who is earning a potential fortune would like to monitor the money rolling in?
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:59:05
No. Once they are sent to your wallet you have that amount. 
If you transfer one currency to another and back again to the original currency you may end up with more or less than what you started with depending on the exchange rate change within that time.

I agree with you entirely about needing regulations. Every time I mention it I get downvoted to buggery so have given up saying it now.

The big problem you face is without wide acceptance of Bitcoin you won't be able to do anything with it as a currency. At the end of the day what will give it it's true value is being able to buy things with it. Wide acceptance unfortunately means acceptance on Wall Street and places like that.

That isn't anything to do with how the finance industry is regulated. That's how the dollar is imposed on other countries. 
I'm talking about people protecting you with regulation from con artists and fraud. If you are defrauded you have an opportunity for claw back and that is down to regulation.

A company that develops the tools used by high-frequency traders has become the first market infrastructure provider to accept payment for services in Bitcoins.
Perseus Telecom, a US trading technology group, said on Thursday it would accept the controversial digital currency for its services worldwide and process transactions with GoCoin, the payment platform.
Its move highlights high-frequency traders’ increasing interest in trading Bitcoin as global regulators indicate a growing acceptance of fast-emerging digital currencies. Despite several high-profile arrests and clampdowns, regulators are talking of ways to regulate the market rather than ban it.
High-frequency traders use complex algorithms and superfast computers to trade in and out of assets in fractions of seconds. Bitcoin is of interest in part because of its electronic nature and because its high daily volatility potentially offers lucrative returns. Many superfast traders have found profitability tougher in recent years in mature and competitive markets such as equities and foreign exchange.
Jock Percy, chief executive of Perseus Telecom, said customers had pressed the company to accept Bitcoin. “The customers are holding the digital asset already and don’t want to exchange it for cash to sell to the software vendor.”
Many high-frequency traders have been put off trading digital currencies by the comparatively slow trading systems. Bitcoin transactions take around half an hour, while equity trades usually complete in microseconds on stock exchanges.
Nevertheless, new venues, such as London-based Coinfloor, are pitching themselves as forums for high-frequency traders in a bid to attract new market entrants.
More video
Perseus said it would accept Bitcoin payment for the services it provides, such as market connectivity, hosting and high-precision monitoring of trading and execution times on many of the world’s largest stock and derivatives exchanges.
Mr Percy said the extension of high-frequency trading into virtual currencies would change the nature of the Bitcoin market over time. “At the moment, [HFT] is still a small part of the market as there are a lot of retail investors trading Bitcoin. In time the spreads will narrow.”
An anonymous computer scientist or group working under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009 as an alternative to fiat currencies. Transactions are conducted through a peer-to-peer network of computers, outside the traditional banking system, and the number of “coins” in circulation is capped.
