The top 5 percent of earners (in the UK for reference, but not much different to US) earn 60k a year. So I really don't think his statement is accurate at all
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:43:53
You lost three quarters of a million dollars?!
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:22:33
Hey, if it wasn't more than you're willing to lose then who cares? It was a learning experience, maybe you'll succeed next time, or learn not to do it again
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:52:08
This comment makes no sense. You say many people make 60k a year, it's nothing, yet then say to sell when it's at a million, earning himself 3mil. Doing the maths, 60k an an hour earns you about 120 million a year, so firstly that's bullshit, secondly 3mil is nothing compared to 120 mil.
If I could offer anyone any advice, it would be not to listen to this guy

You're not a trader until you sell it, or make plans to sell it. It would be the equivalent of buying 100 Ferraris. You're not a Ferrari trader until you set up a deal to sell them, you're just a guy with a lot of Ferraris.

You need to weigh it up reasonably. Don't listen to people blindly telling you to hodl. You don't have anything until you are literally seeing the money in your bank account. If you are happy to be the person who made 35k in btc and that outweighs the risk, then sell now. If you don't care about 35k and want to gamble for potentially 100k or more and are prepared to maybe lose the money, then hodl.
If it was me I would take 1btc out and keep the rest. That way you've made 10k, and have the potential for more. You've definitely won if you do that.

Well fair. But it sounded a bit like you were advising to gamble rent money on btc, which I don’t think is a good idea
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:44:22
This sounds like an incredibly reckless use of money. What if you only had enough money to pay the rent for 1/4 months?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:46:46
I think that’s it’s difficult because you’re bad at it
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:00:33
How much do you want for that keyboard? 0.00056 btc? How about 0.45 btc? Whoops sorry I mean 0.04btc oh no you’ve been outbid by an offer of 0.000008btc with an extra 1.5btc transaction fee. I’ll send the Keyboard next month when the payment comes through!
Yeh not gonna happen any time soon
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:20:19
Wtf happened to this chain of conversation?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:03:48
Yeh this ^^

I understand that there is a wealth of properties that make something a good crypto. At the moment, btc can’t fathomably be used in its current state. I will take a look at the video when I finish work though, because I am interested in the scaling problem with btc
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:06:06
What argument? Better coins exist that have cheaper fees, faster transactions and scale better. Bitcoin was just the first. That’s like arguing that internet explorer is the best browser because chrome came out later and Microsoft have been trying *really* hard recently

Or maybe he’d have gone bankrupt because he couldn’t drive himself to work
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:19:34
Dude wtf is that sentence? @_date: 2017-12-14 16:08:04
You don’t think that some of them really believe in a different crypto than bitcoin? I’m not saying that they’re all like that, some just want easy money, but lots of people do have a real belief in something like IOTA
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:16:49
I agree with the points you’re making. I also think that a really robust crypto currency would be an excellent tool in the world, and lots of people want to make that happen, not for the money
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:10:35
I’m sitting at 80% btc, 20% IOTA. IOTA speaks to me as something that might one day be used. I think it’s fairly clear by now that BTC just doesn’t work for daily transactions, not in its current state
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:24:18
Like 17 million lambos
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:46:42
Abso fuckin lutely.
I'd go as far as to say 21% of all people in the US know what btc is
@_date: 2019-01-26 16:05:36
Ever... Seriously? If I was saving for a house and saved in bitcoin I would have set myself back years.
How can you honestly tell people to keep their savings in such a fluctuating currency? Just because it worked out for you doesn't mean that it everyone should put all their money in bitcoin. That's such a dangerous line of thinking. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:26:32
No, some have infinite amounts, and some don't rely on mining at all. In fact ethereum is looking to switching to a non mining approach (proof of stake) 
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:48:25
Mining eth I drop about 30p a day on electricity and make just over £1. That's with one card. Obviously you can scale that by 10 if you wanted to started making bigger bucks 
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:23:43
The bitcoin I own has lost over half its buy power since I got it. Its ludicrous to insinuate that bitcoin is a better place to put your savings than fiat right now
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:21:35
I'm literally looking it up now, and security feature include: treasury seal, bleeding ink (runs red with moisture), microprinted words that don't show up when copied, a watermark, ultraviolet overprinting
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:45:54
Cheques have a LOT more security than that. You can't just print off a cheque based on someone's bank account
