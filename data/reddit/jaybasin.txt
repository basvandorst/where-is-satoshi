Microsoft 10 doesn't force updates. That's about as crazy as you guys asking for bigger blocks. Except the latter is actually happening somehow
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:07:19
Bitcoin has hardforked 
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:38:54
It's not a currency. It's only a store of value now. You are supposed to hodl your bitcoin, and not spend it. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:21:34
But then it's just going to be a ghost town
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:16:46
If you're freaking out that badly about it Google it 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:31:09
Maybe because he didn't throw all his money into bitcoin and leave himself screwed 
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:16:57
I'm not trying to confuse people. If anything it's called helping. I would love if everyone opened their eyes because soooo many people are going to get hurt 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:05:09
But you're just the cutest, my lil' buttercup :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:01:47
Some people just need to complain so they grasp at straws 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:09:54
Maybe because it's legit
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:43:09
Getting their heads on straight because they can see the future. 
That's what the fuck they're doing 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:03:31
You're also gambling your auction was high enough so he's not wrong
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:32:56
Then you weren't an oldtime bitcoiner
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:48:42
You might wanna hide when the tables flip and your friends aren't too happy with you for lying =/
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:57:58
But thats basically what happened with your leaders lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:44:22
And then to the IRS
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:49:48
There you go shitting on someone again. He shared his insight, which is way more than what you're doing. 
So please, keep on posting your "relevant" comments
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:05:38
I know, I just did. And then I see you being a piece of shit. So it appears you haven't gotten laid 
Thought maybe I'd let you know where you are since life up here is great
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:00:16
And when I see in the news a dentist office went under I'll know what caused it
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:51:27
But why isn't 1 mb too big? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:48:18
And why you care what someone else does while putting him down too is beyond me! People are so shitty today
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:20:29
I'll go jerk it before I get blue balls. Or are you still not old enough to know you don't have to sit there and deal with it? Nice
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:38:56
Just look at who wrote the top post and you have your answer
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:15:08
Depressing is you guys falling for it because there's no dates. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:22:38
Oh that's what you meant. I mean yea, while there's truth in it we should keep the names separate. 
Just because it is the original doesn't mean we take it's name, we just own the fact we're the OG
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:43:59
So rather than paying $100 in transaction fees, you pay the $100 to open a channel, which can hold as many transactions as you want before you close it. 
Now what if I chose to never close it? I never lose bitcoin and the merchant never gains bitcoin for his sold product. 
What if I only want 1 thing? Are we forced to keep the channel open until the transaction exceeds the $100?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:22:30
The conversation looks scripted. OP talks major shit on his dad calling him delusional, and saying he's going to laugh at him. Very salty
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:11:59
But I thought bitcoin took power from the banks and to the people. I've even read stories of banks closing accounts because of the customer messing with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:31:21
Just because there's a goalie doesn't mean you can't score 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:30:41
But everyone over there says bch, or bitcoin cash. You didn't buy bitcoin, but bitcoin cash because they said to. As soon as you realized it wasn't a bitcoin sub, why did you stay? If you really went there thinking it's for bitcoin 
Your fault.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:02:04
Thanks for sharing. When btc fees drop I'll be sure to tip you mmk 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:06:38
Then why are you guys with the wrong coin?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:07:42
Yes please don't think nothing crazy. Lmao
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:27:56
"More insight" Good one
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:57:47
Try harder
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:39:53
Oh that's a nice logic. 
Back in the day, communities thought blacks were trash. Does that mean they're right? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:14:27
No it's difficult for an American to get into crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:53:52
But will bitcoin even reach that point? If merchants don't adopt bitcoin due to fees, then it's going to dwindle into nothing. Unless it truly is a store of value and not to be used as currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:25:26
I love me a good double negative
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:18:52
Lol that's not going to happen. Look at who runs your sub
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:52:35
Good luck, be sure to let us know how it worked 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:57:13
Yes. Just wait.

What do you think about cex.io? 15,229 currently on that exchange. Kinda confused I haven't seen a single 15k!!!!!! post 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:12:39
You're definitely asking in the right place 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:07:15
It's not a currency. Just a store of value, you have to hodl it lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:44:13
Not many times do you see more upvotes on a reply but holy shit. 130 to your 15? God damn
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:34
It's not a currency so hodl away bros. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:25:19
It's all about the illusion. The veil will lift soon, and I feel real bad for everyone who doesn't see the strings. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:25:38
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:58:51
You're not kidding

Better grab some popcorn and kick your feet back. Maybe get a nice girl to blow you.

No it's bitcoin cash. You guys can't just make up acronyms and apply them wherever you like. That's not really how it works
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:02:49
If he isn't already. He's probably staying quiet about how much he owns
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:05:48
Just know that if you do, he's only going to be able to look at it. He can't use it, just sit on it like an egg waiting to hatch...I mean break

Still the same
Can't you read?
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:59:39
So who's the real shmuck?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:08:27
Are you going to reply to those asking about transaction fees? Or are you just an actress?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:04:25
It's demonized because it has a fighting chance. So better to ridicule it and constantly stomp on it than to fight something you know you're going to lose. 
It's a pride issue.

"Even BTab user has to stretch for his ideas to have any merit." 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:02:04
Except nowhere in my post do I come off as angry or salty. So nice try baby
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:32:43
Do you have any facts to back up that he's wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:02:07
And usually when people argue terminology, one of them doesn't understand the term, hence the argue.

If you're at your breaking point, I'm going to feel real sorry for you when everyone wakes up  
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:20:36
Maybe they just feel they have better things to do 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:16:16
We're talking about r/btc dude... not r/bitcoin
P.S. don't forget to hodl trololol 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:36:14
Blackpeopleontwitter isn't racism. 
You're stretching really hard, but that figures. Look at what you're defending
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:31:05
It wouldn't let you because it knows you're wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:13:14
Someone is oblivious lmao
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:58:04
Can it though
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:10:10
Comprehension is on point 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:00:28
I would look more into the difference of BCH and BTC for yourself. 
While BTC is the original, that doesn't mean it hasn't changed into something that it wasn't. Originality doesn't equate to "it's the best option"
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:39:12

Prolly not sucka 
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:16:16
But someone just did ponder...
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:41:41
You're not trying to save anything except bullshit. Nice try but you can't trick people, maybe if you were smarter...
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:44:49
Don't forget your pitchforks. You guys sure know how to run businesses off
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:53:47
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:18:17
You would be correct in both instances. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:51:06
How much longer can people wait? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:21:04
Context says it broke previously which means it's possible for it to happen again. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:58:36
But you just said it, possible. So you aren't predicting you're just saying "it may happen" not "it will or will not"
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:49:57
You're not wrong...and neither is the other guy
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:14:12
If something happened once it's possible to happen again. Easy as that
