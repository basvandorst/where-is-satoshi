I've got this feeling at this point...  that the 32MB limit is going to be another massive and major hurdle to get over.  Even larger than the 1MB limit.
I'd rather compromise to 32MB than stay at 1MB.
Satoshi envisioned massive blocks with the block chain being held by distributed servers in data centers.  With everything in one chain... that is the only way to scale up globally I'm afraid.  Or we wait until consumer grade connections can scale up higher.
I'm currently in the camp of, what can I rent for a server to run a node?
My limit right now is 10TB a month on a gigabit connection, which roughly translates to 2.3Gigabyte blocks.  I'm definitely in the camp of increasing block size.  The biggest problem I have is scaling up the SPV servers, currently CPU usage for processing blocks is a little high.
(I'm not advocating increasing the block size too 2.3Gigabytes currently;  but I can see it eventually getting there).
A hybrid approach is also possible.  Something like this: blocks cannot go over 10X the average of the last 2016 blocks, also a voting mechanism is possible in addition with no 32MB limit.
I'm in the boat that the market will solve the block size problem.  There currently is more incentive for miners to create smaller blocks than larger ones.
My concerns are more about currently holding UTXO in memory and not indexed on disk; CPU time taken on ethereum servers to process a block.
I'd like to someone look into building a special UTXO block (maybe implemented at a AUX block?) every X number of blocks which includes the last X number of UTXO in order to potentially "throw away" a lot of the previous blocks as the critical information would be included in the UTXO block.  This would reduce resource requirements on nodes and allow the network to scale higher.

I don't see a way around any kind of argument in the future about &gt;32MB.
The option that is likely to be chosen is leaving it ambiguous (which you would prefer not to see);  or putting in wording for intent one way or the other.  Likely any wording of intent would get a big negative from someone.
The question is.. is leaving the wording ambiguous but with a 32MB limit (which exists in every plan until the P2P code is redone) enough for people to veto it?
And let me fix that last sentence of yours from the way I read it and understand it.
BIP100 is meant to avoid any further hard forks regarding block size in the future until 32MB is reached.
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:59:56
I did misunderstand you;  I'm not sure if the intent is technical or political... but there is a technical problem (currently) with going over 32MB blocks until the p2p code gets a little work.  So definitely a technical reason to still include in the definition a 32MB block limit.  So that limit of 32MB should be written out.
If you had no limit you could potentially create a &gt;32MB block but not actually be able to transfer the block to anyone else... definitely would be a problem.

Probably because there currently is two problems too solve with blocksize limits.  Currently there are two limits, a 1MB limit and a 32MB limit.   The 32MB limit is pretty complicated to fix right now as there are multiple ways to attack it and people are not sure which method is the best.  Also some(all?) of the methods completely break compatibility with the network.
So...  it is easier to attack the 1MB limit first before attacking the 32MB.
Putting a bunch of work into reworking the currently 32MB problem with the P2P code that likely would completely break the current network doesn't seem that exciting if we can't even increase the block size over 1MB.
EDIT:  When I say the 32MB limit is pretty complicated to fix;  I don't think it is super technically complicated to fix;  just that there is more than one method to do it, which means politically it could be complicated.  This is just conjecture on my part but reading the mailing list there is more than one proposal and definitely not a consensus.
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:14:19
So...  technically there is no limit too block size;  but if you want to transfer that block the p2p protocol is going to be have to be updated.  So... greater than 32MB is here until that area is updated.
So... 32MB for now, and by identifying 32MB as a limit in paper will allow other implementations who might do an alternative implementation not break the "unwritten rule", because that rule exists.  It's just applied in a different area of code.
@_date: 2015-06-18 21:07:36
You're right... if this is going to go the way I want it too;  we are going to blow WAY past the 32MB per block limit.  If putting in energy now to label the 32MB limit as purely a temporary problem due to the protocol makes it much easier to remove it later...  then great.
Changing topics for just a little bit the whole China thing with miners doesn't make sense either with small blocks.  You can run a stratum proxy at the mining location with the node at a datacenter offsite.  Frankly you could run a stratum proxy with a connection via dish satellite networks for almost nothing...
If they are concerned about 20MB...  then they need to do a redesign of how they are running their business.
EDIT:  I am changing my opinion about being ambivalent with the 32MB explicit rule;  instead if it is being put into place it should be identified that it is just a temporary rule because the communication protocol has not been updated yet.  I want this 32MB explicit rule removed at the earliest possible moment.

If the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE was unlimited; bitcoin core would fail at &gt;32MB blocks.
Some head surgery is going to have to be done if you want to go over 32MB every 10 minutes;  options are more blocks per second, an append a block mechanism (aux-block), or changing the network code/block structure slightly that would be incompatible with the current system.
So defining a 32MB hard cap is the "easy way out".  The best fix for the 32MB hard cap of the networking code is undetermined so for now since it isn't an immediate problem the safest option would be too kick the problem down the road.
I wouldn't be too hard on him for putting in a static 32MB cap...  you currently can't just define anything over 32MB.
(and bitcoin XT can't define over 32MB either, or any other implementation without straying far from being able to communicate with the current consensus)

I'd like to see MtGox be transparent.

Bitcoin confirms in seconds, but takes ~10 minutes to settle.

malleability are not doublespends;
the default behavior of bitcoin-qt is to not relay doublespends.
The link you show me is very small transactions (probably people testing) or attempts to gambling sites that do gambling on the block chain.
I respectfully disagree successful double spends are difficult.
Unfortunately however the current reference client does not notify the end user of potential double-spends.  That has to be bubblegummed on after the fact, even though the reference client is aware that it happened.

One reason you want to spend all funds is because now people can attack your public key.  (in case anyone who followed this thread didn't catch onto it immediately)
The theory is if quantum computers/some other vulnerability in the pub/priv key system suddenly existed they might be able to figure out your private key from your public key.
But if you never spend.... there is nothing to attack as your public key was never on the network.
The address is a hash of the public key, so you can't attack it directly.
Personally I find that risk to be low;  but I don't have any way of evaluating that risk except as far as I know it has not happened anywhere yet.  but to each their own.
Another reason is it makes it harder to pin down who owns which address by always moving to new addresses

Who is MtGox?
Because from what I can see MtGox is currently a collection of assets and debts (mostly debts) that is managed by Nobuaki Kobayashi and he isn't paying anyone unless they submit a claim.
I guess you could sue Nobuaki Kobayashi... you can't sue MtGox though.  They have protection from suits right now.
There is a lot of things MtGox should have been doing...  yes MtGox should give it all back.  Just like they should give everyone back money that was deposited with them.  We are in this predicament because they are a nice big black hole and won't pay anyone.

Except that analogy may not be the best, he didn't drop his wallet into the libraries book drop;  he wrote a transfer of funds, from his account to a account held in his name at Gox.  Of which I'm sure Gox dutifully wrote down that Gox now owes the owner of that account 800 BTC. :P
I'm not going to argue that Gox doesn't owe him.  Because they do.
They did however say very clearly, they are not paying anybody unless a claim is made.  I don't see anyway where he is going to get any kind of special treatment.

depends on the current propogation time of transactions across the network.
Currently propagation is between 3 and 10 seconds for worldwide saturation...  So with 45 seconds it is effectively zero, as none of your peers would accept your other transaction and would throw it away as the transaction was already in the current mempool; however if you broadcast your transaction under 10 seconds there is a non-zero chance of getting your coins back.
If the target merchant has a better node connection to miners it is even harder to doublespend.
Also it depends on what service you are using... you will notice that the block chaingambling is frequent targets of doublespend attacks.  The reason for this is eligius (and others?) refused to include/relay the transaction in a block and as such it is easier to doublespend against satoshidice then other transactions.
For almost all transactions zero confirmation is safe.  (key word almost);  certain target businesses are absolutely more prone to doublespends than others.

default behavior of the reference client is to not forward any transactions that match existing outputs.  So if you broadcast multiple transactions that take input from the same output through different nodes you will end up in a tossup if the client even sees the transaction.  It's a gamble, unless you know the exit node that the client uses and are able to isolate all of the communication.
@_date: 2014-06-03 08:15:52
sounds easy... just tell the bank to reverse the transaction...  :P.
I hope people realize I'm not arguing about what should or shouldn't be done.  What you believe should or should not happen likely is irrelevant.
Just mentioning that practically the money is at Gox and there is no bank to call to reverse the transaction.  The only person that (supposedly) has access to those accounts is Nobuaki Kobayashi.
And he says he is not transferring any funds to anybody until after a claim is filed (which a method currently does not exist to file a claim).
Then Nobuaki is going to order the claims to be fair in his mind, and depending upon who the OP hires and how well the claim is written likely the previous owner of the 800 BTC will not get 800BTC in return.  And there is nothing the OP can do about it except word a very nice claim because Nobuaki has a LOT of creditors.
The OP may think s/he should be treated differently however one will have to convince Nobuaki that and there is no bank to reverse this transaction.

My opinion the blocksize should go to 16mb.
reasons:  I think 16 is a neat number and the number 16 has been used in a bunch of cool tech.  And bitcoin is cool!

No;  both transactions would be exactly the same (even with transaction malleability).  You cannot change anything critical about the transaction (except for maybe the TX).
The destination would either see one transaction or the other one... doesn't really matter as both would be BTC in the destination account.
Transaction malleability attacks the sender if the sender decides to keep track of transactions by transaction id, not by keeping track of the outputs.
In this case you the sender is doing the attacking... why would you make multiple transactions all trying to send money to the destination address with the same outputs?  double-spending is about sending to other bitcoin addresses.

I wasn't targeting bursts as in the difference between times a block is confirmed.  I was hoping people would see that there is a difference between mempool transactions per second and confirmed transactions per second.
TPS is a terrible method in my opinion of measuring the network.
Is TPS measuring the mempool speed or the time taken to fill a bucket which gets packaged into a block?
If one measures a transaction for confirmed the TPS usually show zero TPS, then the speed jumps to 3000 TPS (for a very short period of time).  If someone creates 1000 transactions in a second the network will (likely) accept it.
A "somewhat" more accurate method of measuring transactions speed would be in average 10 minute increments.
I.E.  The current network currently supports 3000 transactions per block every 10 minutes with a average transaction size of X.
Anyone who uses TPS (including me) is not 100% explaining the entire picture.
Due to technologies such as coinjoin bundling transactions and many different transaction sizes these numbers such as "3 or 7" transactions per second are all not in my opinion a great method of measuring...
In the future this thought exercise is likely to be irrelevant anyway as the current small block size was only intended to be temporary anyway.

Instead of thinking that is a hard rule of 7 transactions per second;  it is a bucket every approximately 10 minutes.  Sometimes that bucket can come along in much less time, sometimes in a lot more time and if the buckets for some reason don't get filled instantly the transaction still stays in the mempool.
bitcoin can burst significantly higher in a shorter period of time, but depending upon the transaction it likely won't be able to handle more than 7 transactions per second sustained over a long period of time.
With the (current) average transaction size sustained is around 3 transactions per second.
But even that isn't the whole truth, each transaction can have multiple ins and outs.  (i.e. a scheduled payout from some pools will be listed as one transaction but it will be one bundled transactions with potentially hundreds of outgoing payments but listed as just one on the blockchain)
If the mempool gets filled up the transactions get prioritized, and this issue of tps is being worked on by reducing the pain level of large blocks via IBLT and by likely increasing the block size.

The transactions may be a lower priority than some other transactions because of the fees paid per KB and AGE of previous UTXO.
If this "spam" paid more transactions fees they would have likely have a higher priority.
Miners should be able to discern based on their own policies and priorities what is best for them to mine.  Each miner basically has its own market for a block, with their own rules.  If everyone mined with the same policies we'd have a pretty homogeneous system...  which wouldn't be promoting diversity at all.
If some miners decide to not mine based on destination it is their right;  I'm sure another miner will happily take payment for the transaction.

shipping-order  (one digit after the previous order)
I paid for both of them (via bitpay) back to back about 20 minutes after ordering was silently opened.  This tells me that the 1-500 pre-order was sorted NOT based off of pre-order number but based off of when the paid completion date was.

That is your choice on the risk level you wish to take.  Are you talking about a sybil attack?  That might be a little overkill for the dollar amount for a business transaction.  If you could identify where your target phone/tablet was... it still would not be easy.  I'm running SPV on mine connecting to some trusted hosts that you would have to trick.  Would not be easy.
Is that what you were thinking of?
I'm not 100% sure what you mean about generating and receiving a QR code for a transaction that has occurred as the notification of a transaction does not occur via QR, but from the cloud.

perhaps invest in bitcoin wifi hotspot software such as:
selling internet access for cheap but only by bitcoin would increase visibility

The bitcoin improvement protocol states that if 950 of the last 1,000 blocks vote a certain way then the change happens.  But if they don't it doesn't change.  So if 55% of the network updates the client and 45% does not then the new feature won't be deployed by the new version of the client.

You should have two order numbers, your regular order number and your pre-order order number....

seems a little slow, I counted over 10 seconds one time to go from one page to another.  Newegg's and amazon's webservers are way more responsive.
@_date: 2013-10-03 23:25:13
When did you pay?  What method?  I wonder if they took the first 500 pre-orders then reordered them based on pay date.
Mine was paid and completed on June 3rd at 9:01am (sweden time) via bitpay

From me reading;  he said the bitcoins they confiscated from his computer are his, however the bitcoins the Feds confiscated from the SR servers he does not own.

same thing happened to me

held;  hopefully I can buy more if USD can get transferred into the exchange

So, my order number is between 30 and 40;  looks like you're between 300-400.  I'm betting they didn't get through day 1 of production that was shipped.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:45:17
So how do you explain I ordered 2, and both pre-orders were VERY different but they did not ship based off of the pre-order number but the numbers were right next to each other?  (I submitted 2 orders back-to-back and paid immediately)
@_date: 2013-10-03 22:09:39
I was a day one shipping... mine shipped 10/2/2013;  estimated arrival of 10/8/2013.  No sense in getting too uptight.  If a day or two is going to make that much stress...  Things will work out!

My problem with this is since I am in a minority locale I keep on seeing the majority pass laws on a federal level that nobody wants and negatively impacts everyone in our general area.  If (for example) California wants to push their agenda;  please let them just affect California not everyone else.

Betcoin's security implementation could be improved;  What about the result from a hash of 2 blocks combined and use that instead?  It would be slower but certainly more secure.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:05:26
actually no;  change in the code has nothing to do with 51%.
If you are changing the protocol you'll need consensus of 950 of the last 1000 blocks.  Otherwise whatever change you broadcast the block will be seen as invalid.  (At least this was the case with BIP_0034)
If you start mining with a change even if you are mining over 51% if every block you make is rejected as invalid...  you are not going to get anywhere.  The network has to accept it and that is a combination of proper transactions being relayed and blocks that correspond to the accepted consensus.
Unless you do something else... which is of course possible;  but then it wouldn't really be the standard track bitcoin anymore would it?  Probably a spinoff altcoin at that point due to the fork.

I found out there is 3 order numbers on each KNC.  (order/pre-order/shipping-order)  Based on one pre-order number being 3x and the other 17x, and me paying for them back to back, both of my pre-order numbers after the sort done on paid date ended up being both between 10 and 20 for my actual shipping order number.  It didn't matter what your pre-order number was (1-500), it just mattered if you were in one of those numbers, because they just applied (1-500) as a sql tag and then ran a sort based on when the payment was completed.  So a pre-order with a  that didn't pay till the last day would end up at the end of the 1-500 range.
everyone that paid with paypal was probably immediately behind the curve because paypal doesn't clear immediately

Maybe we can get them to call you up, or tell you in person...

I thought the same as you did at one time;  in practice it is extremely difficult to double spend.  If you see the transaction on the wire... you will be getting the coins.  It is true that a person who is motivated ahead of time to try to double spend can do it, but for low value amounts...  no one is going to put the effort into doing it;  not with the network as large as it is today anyway.

you should do the swap;  silver is pretty cool
@_date: 2013-10-03 23:21:18
yep;  but you are lucky to even get a device.  This will be my 2nd ASIC, first asic came 4 months late and I was one of the last person to receive mine.  So I know how it feels;  I wouldn't panic yet though.
What coz131 has not said was, what was the order number;  what was the pre-order number?  When did payment actually go through?
Boxes are not shipped based 100% on order number they are shipped based off of pre-order and payment time.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:05:54
The last one was because of a version incompatibility;  hopefully that will never happen again.  The transactions were not invalidated though as they appeared on both blockchains.  You can offload that risk too your payment provider (i.e. bitpay/coinbase);  although I don't think the risk is very high.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:20:49
You just guaranteed a increase in value;  bitcoin does not have a guarantee... none whatsoever.  Can you guarantee me that bitcoin is going to go up in value?  The variables pulling bitcoin in multiple directions are many!

Probably has the laptop hooked up via USB to a box, aka a ASIC miner, so the laptop is running cgminer or something similar...
