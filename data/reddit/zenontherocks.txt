To be fair, its probably a power play. As in the MC guys get what they want from their bankster buddies, or else they make a push for bitcoin. I don't know what they want, but you can bet this is more about hurting somebody than it is about helping bitcoin. That's just how things work.

Money laundering is just an excuse to seize control. Who cares if its true or not? The real reason governments hate the concept of a decentralised currency is because they *are the current centralization*. Anything not directly under their control is considered a threat to their power, but *especially* the monetary supply. Right now the Federal Reserve functions almost like a 4th branch of government, only more powerful in some ways.

You'd be surprised. G+ is a huge community of strangers, organized by groups of common interest. A little bit like reddit in that way. I had to give it up just because I was getting annoyed by hundreds of notifications a day. If I wanted to give away bitcoin, I could have done it a lot faster on G+ than I ever could on Facebook.

I don't think its possible to get rid of it. It is, however, possible to make it illegal. My question was just - what will people do when that happens? What if they offered an alternative cryptocurrency that was controlled by the federal reserve, would we compromise and just use that? We already see startups capitulating to the government with ID requirements and palm scans, etc.
There's a lot of power in controlling a nations currency. People with that much power never give up without a fight. My question is simply - when that time comes, will we fight back?

Its a quote from the article linked by Hostfat. Personally I think part of security is not making all your private information public, and I think that's common sense. If that becomes a requirement - not just for OpenBazaar but for any service I want to use - I'll start lying about my online identity and make a network of liars so we can all verify each other.

I'm no fan of EBay and PayPal, in fact I've been boycotting them for about 5 years now, but I'm not the least bit mad about their market domination.

Well there's your problem right there. We're not cryptocurrencies, we're people. And people - every one of us - lives life not entirely outside the boundaries of the law, nor within them. People will break a law if the reward for doing so outweighs the risk. The reason why no business that deals primarily in cash will report their full income is the same reason that we all drive a few mph over the speed limit. Because we can, and we get where we're going a little faster by doing so.
Bitcoin is beyond regulation by design. To think that a thing can and will change simply because an oligarchy demands it in writing is beyond ignorant of how the world really works. Don't get me wrong - there will be some voluntary compliance. But ultimately, you have no power here.

I enjoyed the bit about NSA surveillance as well. I'd never seen that "tor stinks" presentation before. I knew the NSA was good and pissed off about tor, but if you look up that presentation it details a little bit where they've struggled and where they've had success against it.

Well we need 2 things in the short run:
Free market solutions. Think ADA for the dental industry. Also maybe a new type of third party "diversification service" that doesn't hold your bitcoins but helps you keep them in tens or hundreds of different services of your choice at once. And how about a plain old insurance company to insure your bitcoins against the next Gox? That's just off the top of my head. Plenty of more creative minds out there just waiting to be the hero we need.
Secondly, we need comprehensive cost/benefit analysis of regulation with enforcement. We just lost some money to Gox, but was it less than we would have paid for rule creation and enforcement? If the current unregulated bitcoin system really is demonstratably better, we need to show that, factually, to the world.

... Sigh. No thanks I'll just use EBay then.
@_date: 2014-09-04 17:56:52
Right. That was one of the interesting things about the "tor stinks" presentation actually. They can de-anonymize traffic where they control all relays in between clients, but that's rare. And apparently as of the time of the presentation, there had been no instance where they were able to de-anonymize a specific target. Instead they seemed to be focusing more on "degrading the user experience" by doing things like setting up really slow tor relays. So just basically trying to get people to stop using it.
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:32:02
The one thing I liked most about bitcoin, the anonymity, is the one thing every startup tries to remove. And there's absolutely no good reason for it.

@_date: 2014-09-04 19:05:58
Well the data, including address info, wouldn't be completely decrypted until the final step which happens in the tor software on your computer.
Basically, the web service sends an encrypted data package to relay C, relay C opens the package using its own encryption keys, and inside it finds more encrypted data and instructions to send that data to relay A. Relay A gets a similar package and instructions to send to B. B gets a similar package and instructions to send to D. D, as it turns out, is you. Relay B had no idea that it was sending data to the end user, the only thing they see is an address and some data that they can't open. Only you know that you're the end client because when you use your key, it opens everything and there is no forwarding address. Your ISP just thinks you're talking to relay B. The only way to track the package is to either break the encryption (too time consuming with that volume), or control all relay points in between (rare).

Rand Paul neither denies climate change, nor thinks the environment is a joke.

I would imagine that depends on which bureaucrat or lawyer you're talking to. Possibly all of the above, depending what they claim bitcoin does/is able to do.

A lot of that has already happened.

He's not a climate change denier. Denying climate change and trying to find alternative solutions to the problem are two very different things. People are throwing a bitch-fit because they can only see one solution, claiming if you don't support that solution you must not agree that there's a problem. From a practical standpoint we have to find a solution that doesn't shrink the economy.
I know he's said there are people who blow the problem out of proportion, but he's absolutely correct about that. 20 years ago people were saying New York would be underwater by now. You have to work with real data and sort out the alarmism.

I kinda guessed that, which is why I added that bit about it at the end.
I see net neutrality as a stop-gap measure that should have never been needed in the first place. I called in and supported it any way I could, but I fully agree with Rand Paul's assessment of it. It's a lot of control and it opens us up to indirect abuse from the other side. What we need to do now is to start removing these conditions that allowed the monopolies to exist in the first place. I think Net Neutrality should be the last thing to go, but really if we can provide the proper soil for a bunch of new startups to grow and prosper, it may not end up mattering at all when it's done away with.

Breaking regs is a good start, since most of those regs were created by the big telecoms themselves. Most of the regs that we have are just things telecoms were already doing or could do easily, and were created to stifle startup competition. Net neutrality is not necessarily one of those things, but it may have a similar effect in the end.

I don't think that's something we'd want him to get into. Data hacking turns into a Mt Gox type discussion. That's one of the biggest percieved downsides to someone that doesn't understand the currency.
Yes, if someone hacks the Walmart data system and gets credit card information it's bad, but theoretically in that situation Walmart and your bank and the police would cooperate to protect you from harm. Whereas if someone could walk through Walmart wirelessly hacking into peoples iPhones for bitcoin, he'd probably never get caught and then there's no recourse to get your money back.
Data security is one of the percieved shortcomings of Bitcoin currently, and honestly it is something we need to work harder on to gain the publics trust.
DIGITAL CASH is how it needs to be pitched. It's simple and explains the concept well. From there you can explain why it's more secure than cash.

I'm not sure what you mean. Gods first recorded words to Adam were just a command to fill the earth and subdue it. Was there something he said after that was a lie?
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:11:01
That's an interesting read, but there are several points that they get just plain wrong. However, the point that god said they would die "in the day you eat from it" could be considered a lie if you consider the references to days in the genesis account to be literal days, instead of ages (e.g. "back in my day...").
This along with other references to days in the Genesis account are the basis for "young earth creationist's" belief that the earth was created in 6 days, which myself and almost everybody else considers to be absurd, and incompatible with other verses that say god does not interpret time in the same way that we do ("1,000 years is as a day to god").
Understand I'm not trying to defend the bible. I'd be a hypocrite if I did. For the purposes of this discussion I've stuck to only reiterating what it says, to the best of my knowledge. To get into interpretation is quite a bit deeper and I feel unqualified and unmotivated to do that.
What the bible says is that Satan told the first lie, and is "the father of the lie", which I agree with you is wholly incompatible with the literal translation of that verse.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:30:59
I think the important thing there would be the timeline. I don't know Greek so you might have more insight on this than I do.
My understanding is that God can see into the future. This could imply predestination, but doesn't necessarily negate free will, depending on how you look at it. To see what it would be like to see things from the future, just look at the past now. We're already living in the future compared to the past. Does that mean any decision we made in the past was not made of our own free will?

I think you're referring to the life of Jesus on earth.

It also says that he returned to heaven and resides there now again in spirit form.

@_date: 2015-02-04 05:29:22
Thanks I appreciate that. I enjoy talking about it because I think the subject is interesting, and if I don't watch myself I can easily slip into interpretation on certain subjects, especially with regard to Genesis. For me that book probably raises more questions than it answers (Did god invent the original implement of war with the spinning sword guarding the garden? Would Adam and Eve have disobeyed if they had the knowledge of good and bad to begin with, or was blind obedience the entire point of the lesson?... And more).
I think its likely the entire account is metaphorical, which goes even deeper into interpretation if you think about what lessons we were meant to learn from Cain and Abel, or from Noah, or their long life spans of 900+ years, or so many other details that just seem bizarre but not likely meaningless.
