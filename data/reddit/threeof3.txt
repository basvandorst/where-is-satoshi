Good link. The author, Nassim Taleb, is one of the most important, provocative, challenging (and short-tempered, at least with people who can't read a text very closely to grok the author's intent) thinkers I have encountered in about a decade. MUST READ. You can get a lot of his books for free online, or you can buy them. Helps to have a math background, but not necessary. Start at

Not Bitcoin's fault, but it is a cultural problem for crypto, unless you are savvy enough to backup your wallet, and deal with all the upgrades, etc. that require a fresh backup and in some cases new backup procedures...not to mention, the crypto economy won't develop much without trustworthy exchanges but exchanges can fake volume and do other things to appear reliable so it is hard to know...

In that case, the exchange and the owner would have the seed...in which case, they can still steal your coins? But at least if they fail but are not thieves you can still get your coins.

Been reading up on this. Yes, OP  would have to move the coins, not the keys. I think they call this a "sweep" as opposed to importing your keys from the exchange into your wallet (ledger). So I guess I disagree with  statement "the keys are the coins". He should move his coins, not his keys.  
There's still no easy way to have your coins on deposit in an exchange wallet, without trusting the exchange itself.

Bear in mind, the person who coined the term black swan says TA doesn't work for predictions, managing risk, or anything else, **full stop**. In fact in some cases it gives false certainty, making traders and the system more fragile than without it.
