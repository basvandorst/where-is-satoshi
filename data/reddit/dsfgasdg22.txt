on the main chain, yes.. probably.. there can be sidechains though.

nothing.. as long as they go through with it. There's a HF baked in for 90 days later, but that's a separate issue and most likely many of the miners will bail out and revert to a non-segwit2x implementation once segwit is activated.

as a reditor for 0 days I feel this would be unnecessarily discriminatory and racist.
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:57:48
probably not anywhere near their face value..

Bitcoin was already hardforked; there is [bitcore]( - it has 20MB blocks! Isn't that wonderful.. why don't you go and use that? Bitcoin can be hard forked at any time by anyone (as was done with bitcore) - the difference is that the 1MB segwit softfork allows continuity for existing users, whereas a hardfork does not.. the segwit2x won't be any more 'bitcoin' than bitcore is and I bet you'd never even heard of bitcore before. There will probably be 10 or more things like bitcore eventually with little tweaks here and there (just like segwit2x) and still none of them will be bitcoin.. the only thing segwit2x has going for it is some miner support and a loud bunch of idiot promoters.. but neither of  those are killer features.

'cause noone (aside from &lt;10 pool operators) will be using segwit2x and it's more profitable to mine a coin people actually use? If you think everyone will adopt segwit2x, consider why wouldn't they just adopt litecoin or some other alt instead? or why haven't they already adopted [bitcore]( Different people will do different things (some go to segwit2x, some go to alts, some abandon crypto entirely, some won't even notice anything is going on), and all the while bitcoin will still exist and still be processing transactions albeit possibly slower than normal.

use a cash deposit into someone's bank account on localbitcoins.. forget prepaid, it's just costing a load in fees for no reason.

They look at it and try to figure out if it's fake or not.

[kraken.com]( is a good choice.. there are also [bitstamp.net]( [zyado.com]( [gatecoin.com]( and [gdax.com](

I suspect he's talking about creating a very large (1MB?) hard to verify transaction.. the [quadratic hashing bug]( and [here](
maybe $30 is his estimate of what it would cost to get a miner to include it. or perhaps someone has come up with a novel way to make pathological transactions more cheaply.

sure it makes sense.. maybe it would be nice if some of the green blocks were a different color then to capture that the orphaning is only temporary in order to activate segwit on the old clients, and that after it's activated they're allowed again.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:45:34
might be worth including a few blue blocks after segwit activates as there will probably be some.

you can rule out poloniex, those addresses are older.

A waste of money.. nodes that you aren't using to transact add little value to UASF.. basically people need to be afraid that you won't accept their transactions because they're on the wrong end of a chain split.. which means a prerequisite for anyone caring about your node is that you use it to engage in commerce with other network participants. Also, RPIs are barely able to run nodes at the moment.. they may not even really be able to keep up in a segwit world and it's unlikely you'll bother to keep 30 of them running and stocked with enough storage for more than a few months.

[kraken.com]( is a good choice.. there are also [bitstamp.net]( [zyado.com]( [gatecoin.com]( and [gdax.com](
If you really want them fast try  or 
edit: also  may be an ok option.

It's normal for domains to be in clientTransferProhibited unless you're trying to transfer to a new domain registrar.. they should allow you to unlock it somehow if you do want to transfer out.. that should have no impact whatsoever on your ability to create DNS entries though.
@_date: 2017-07-03 00:43:29
oh noes! anyway it's too late, you'll remember me when you're proved wrong in the future :)

Basically core would prefer if someone else did it.. and they did - that's what uasf is.
