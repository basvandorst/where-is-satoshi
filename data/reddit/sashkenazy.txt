the BLS was indeed once bribed by newt gingrich to pass new standards of CPI calculation, because the 'money saved from SS and medicare could really help the agency' 
Also using 'what people actually bought' (the method of substitution) is a great way to hide inflation. People switching from milk to orange juice concentrate because it's getting too expensive? Guess they just like orange juice now!

the debt crisis and central banking are the same inseparable monster. By their very nature, central banks have never and will never engage in long term tightening - this is not a 'disagreement' or a policy choice like you make it out to be. It is simply the path fiat currencies take, and that's that.
Bitcoin will consume these weak currencies, fueled by the most powerful force on earth, self interest. There's nothing to be done to stop it, so figure it out or don't.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:24:09
Yeah, absolutely. still in my opinion this level of debt is not something that can be dealt with responsibly, and it is a condition that is universal among all developed nations without exception: low central bank rates accommodating massive debt levels.
So a new money has been created that prevents against this ever happening.

2.25 is just barely above the level of rates during the 'easy lending' environment of 2000s housing bubble. We are not at zero, but looking at a 50yr context the difference is laughable. We are, for all practical purposes, at 0% rates.
Home lending standards have tightened, how nice. An 18 year old can get a $20,000 student loan in about an hour over the internet though. These are being repackaged into derivative products, securities. You might call them student-loan-backed-securities.
Students loans have the highest rate of default among any type of debt in America, at 12% currently - and this is pre-recession. Expect the number to climb since we are due to enter recession - cycles happen. Even worse, the end product (a college degree) is considered increasingly less useful, while the price climbs and the hype continues.
I'm not saying it's gonna be student loans necessarily. The point is that ultra-low interest rates WILL find their way into SOMETHING. It isn't possible to hyper-pressurize something so complex without it going wrong.

in the immediate midst of a downturn, a flight from securities and speculative assets occurs. Cash is king. interest rates go up, bankruptcies take place, a credit crunch occurs. Cash becomes more valuable. keynesians mistakenly call this 'deflation' 
i completely and totally agree with you on a 10 year time scale for instance. But bitcoin will suffer in the immediate aftermath of a crunch like that, I believe

Hahaha, I can address this. If you know a bit about some taboo news subjects then the deception is easy to spot.
Typically Snopes doesn't outright plainly lie. They do something more clever: They cherry pick or rephrase the claim in order to create a 'punching bag' version of the claim that they can then 'debunk'.
9/11 is a good thread to pull on:
In fact, Five Israelis were arrested on 9/11 with traces of explosives, ~$5k in a sock, tickets to leave to different countries, maps with the WTC highlighted, working for a moving company that appeared to be a front. This is very much true but rather alarming, so it will not be fact-checked.
or: 
In fact, just two Jewish NYers claimed they were warned in advance in Hebrew over an Israeli IM service. They may be lying about that, no way to know, but of course Snopes instead chooses the absurd punching bag of 4,000 people warned - only an idiot would believe that.
Some others using the same strategy:

They're not going to be making base layer bitcoin transactions, they aren't going to be running a full node on a raspberry pi, they won't be spinning up a lightning node from a linux command line, they won't be manually locking up cold funds in a multisig address...
The idea is that second/third layer infrastructure can improve to the point where 'normies' can go in an app, purchase/send bitcoin instantly and simply (by clicking a name in their friend list for instance). All while preserving fundamentals - ownership of private keys, txns using your own node rather than a third party, without the user even being aware of these safeguards.
Similar to the progression in the email protocol, which was only accessible for super nerds early on, and is now easy enough for anybody.

There is zero evidence to suggest WL was given info on Republicans and did not release it. There is a theory, based on a long string of assumptions, that WL must have RNC emails because it has been claimed that Russian malware was at the RNC. So many leaps to get to that.

No, the swedes wanted to drop the case because there was no indication anything criminal occured, but they ended up succumbing to UK pressure and continuing the case. Also Assange was never charged with anything, only 'wanted for questioning' for sexual assault allegations.

@_date: 2019-04-12 06:07:20

There is an indictment with a lot of claims about Guccifer 2, but you are mischaracterizing the situation by saying there's a lot of evidence that Russians did it. There really isn't. The metadata on the DNC servers was never allowed to be looked at. The leaks themselves contained no evidence pointing in any direction.
G2's parallel leaks on the other hand had clear Russian metadata, such as: adding a bunch of spaces at the end of a DNC email and saving it again needlessly, imprinting the username metadata (a famed Soviet general) on the file. Totally doesn't sound like a put-up job, right? Sorry if I'm coming off like an asshole, but I don't buy that professional GRU agents are that sloppy.
@_date: 2019-04-12 06:14:08
Lol so much bullshit.
The WL Russia Spy Files release details how the GRU puts hardware backdoors in electronics, what companies they work with to do so, and how the backdoors function.

a fixed amount of currency leads to less spending, less consumption, less lending and more saving than inflationary fiat. Not a total stoppage of economic activity. 'Hoarding' is a common criticism. The point of 'hoarding' is of course to eventually spend, and all participants in the system have varying time preferences (i.e. an octogenarian isn't hoarding cash for the future, but a teenager might)
Inflationary fiat, as we can see, leads to more spending, more consumption, more lending, less saving, ever descending interest rates, ever increasing levels of debt, massive government expenditure and waste, etc. More economic activity? YES. But what does that really mean, and is it a good thing?
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:03:42
If you want to expand the money supply to prevent hoarding as you say, you will have to create money *somewhere*, and in all cases the new money will be issued straight to the most powerful people you accuse of benefiting from deflationary policy. Has it ever not been this way? (I seriously wonder.)
I could go on, but it doesn't matter what you think. No one will choose an inflationary currency if a 'hard' currency like bitcoin achieves the same utility in all other respects. Inflation is something that must be thrust onto people with no other choice. Now, in the marketplace of currencies, your ideas will finally die.
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:13:07
you can find an economics professor that would say that, because you can find economics professors that will say anything. But that's beside the point.
whatever you think money 'officially' is according to people that do not matter, it would obviously be preferable to the user if it could be held during periods of indecision or uncertainty without penalizing the user. 
you can only argue against this feature if you are advocating from a policymaking perspective, and in that case, who cares

There is one single property of bitcoin which is a true milestone in human history.
Then there are some other properties you mentioned, some really significant, some just interesting.
The central innovation is simply monetary policy. The ideal currency is perfectly predictably scarce. This is not a mainstream opinion but it is the correct one. The debates are well worn by now and everything has been said. Read Rothbard, Mises, Bastiat...
Maintainers of currency adopt the economic policy that suits themselves. These policies must be forced on people since they are evidently not ideal.
Bitcoin has a hard coded perfect monetary policy and cannot succumb to the corruptions of central custodianship. It doesn't look like it can be stopped, despite many very serious attempts to kill it. It's approaching 10 years now.
Every developed nation is targeting negative real interest rates. Nearly every developed nation is maintaining historically unprecedented levels of debt. An office worker in Greece will spend the next twenty years paying for the disastrous mistakes of criminals. And what's the future for Japan, the US... ? You couldn't ask for a better moment for Bitcoin.
