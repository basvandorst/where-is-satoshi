Well I'm convinced.  Thanks!

Far be it for me to question a large perfectly round number with no explanation or calculation in a story published on the internet, but perhaps the authors wouldn't mind explaining how they calculated this large perfectly round number?

A few typos.  I fixed them for you:
~~Trump has~~ **Democrats have** encouraged ~~his~~ **their** supporters at ~~his~~ rallies to beat up, **threaten, and insult** protesters and ~~has offered to cover their legal costs if they get arrested~~ **anyone else expressing contrary beliefs.** ~~One~~ **several** times ~~his~~ **their** supporters **attacked various people and destroyed property** ~~beat up a hispanic homeless man in Boston and when they told Trump about it he said he admired "the passion" of his supporters.~~ **One reason HRC lost the election is that many democrats really don't feel bad about attacking, assaulting, and insulting Trump supporters or anyone else who expresses contrary beliefs.**  ~~If that girl is a Trump supporters I don't feel bad for her one bit.~~

Still waiting to get in at $800, but MAY consider $836.54 now

My point was that most of those affected did not understand they were effectively leaving their wallet at the corner store... right?  That is, there are technical and practical considerations associated with crypto-currency -- some presently understood, some partially understood, and presumably some which have not yet even dawned on most people -- and those considerations  carry risk.  
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:21:30
Silly me.  I assumed it was the result of some sort of "calculation."  
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:43:15
I'm a noob but I think what they're saying is that the perpetually propagated list of bitcoin transactions (i.e., the blockchain) could potentially split into multiple lists and there could be a dispute or disagreement as to which list controls.

I am looking to enter the market with a small one-time investment, intended to be long-term.  I absolutely intend to use a hardware wallet or even a paper wallet which strikes me as potentially more secure in some ways.  But my understanding is that I will need to use Coinbase or something similar to make my initial purchase.  Am I overlooking something?  I am planning to use coinbase to convert USD$ &gt; BTC, then immediately transfer the BTC to my hardware or paper wallet.  Is this a bad idea?

&lt;&lt;Sees chart showing the supply of BTC over time&gt;&gt;
OK, that checks out.  Now let's see how they arrived at their calculated value....

I don't know about GDAX or Gemini, but it looked like Coinbase wants to charge 1.5% for bank transactions and 4% for credit card transactions earlier today.

Now I'm **doubly** convinced.  &lt;&lt;Hurriedly orders MAGA hat&gt;&gt;

Didn't many people have bitcoins lost by exchanges or stolen by hackers?  I'm a noob

I actually hated Trump, too.  I don't deny that he's an idiot.  I was simply making a rhetorical point.   I do believe, however, that much of what has been portrayed as him "inciting violence" is overblown and taken out of context, although yes, some of it is idiotic, dangerous, and inviting of counter attacks (like this).  
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:45:55
That would be doubling down not a hedge.  Would need some way to short BTC for him to hedge and approve

This.  I have been waiting to get in at $800 for DAYS
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:27:18
Why is Coinbase impervious to hacking?  Serious question.  I'm a noob.  If they have some magic bullet defense perhaps I will consider
@_date: 2017-02-10 13:51:35
Thanks!  that's the one I was looking at.   
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:34:34
Thanks for the pep talk.  I have been waiting to get in at $800 for some time now and recently starting to feel glum.   After reading this: WAITING TO GET IN AT $650!

Great.  It's dead. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:04:29
LOL. Thanks.

Would love to hear more about your paper wallet experiences.   How did you generate your private and public keys?  I have seen at least one website that purports to randomly generate key sets but I'm slightly wary of relying on any algorithm I didn't create myself.

SEC Email Line Swamped Ahead of Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF Decision
"I will say that, for people that are emailing in, we have nothing to say about bitcoin, so please stop asking. I don't know what that means, but that's what I've been told to say."
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:19:07
Coinbase is down
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:51:39
SEC was presumably hoping the W-vii would withdraw

Nah.  I'm waiting to get in at $800.   
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:10:10
So wouldn't a fork halve the value of all BTCs which were in the blockchain at the time of the fork? EDIT: by which I mean, halve the value on each side of the fork.
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:52:00
Got it!  That makes sense.  Thanks.  
@_date: 2017-02-24 14:35:40
Pardon my ignorance (again, noob here), but weren't those affected holding (hodling) their bitcoins in the exchanges or elsewhere?  
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:52:49
Thanks.  I'm wondering how bitcoins purchased before the fork can remain valid on both forks.  The BTC I purchased last week, for instance, is associated with a particular set of public/private keys (I transferred it to a paper wallet immediately on purchase).  If there is a fork, what stops me from sending the same amount twice, once on each fork?
@_date: 2017-02-22 02:07:13
Will dip below $800 when the brothers W-vos get denied
@_date: 2017-01-29 17:26:45
Wow, thanks to all of you for the quick and helpful responses!
@_date: 2017-01-30 02:28:40
No.  I am just being overly cautious in wanting to generate my own private key manually.  The second step would then be generating the corresponding public key which is derived by applying a unique, non reversible mathematical formula to the private key.  That must be done by a computer.   To be 100% completely certain that no trace remains of the private key input, one possibility would be to destroy the computer after generating the public key.  But even i would not go quite this far.  Most people dont worry about any of this and simply use a wallet app to create and track both keys for them.
@_date: 2017-01-29 18:50:49
Interesting.   My concern is that many RNG algorithms are not truly random and I specifically read this is a known concern with bitcoin wallets:
@_date: 2017-01-29 17:26:32
Thanks, this is precisely what I was hoping to do, ideally.  I take it from this response (and the others) that a hardware wallet comes with an app or utility to generate the public key from any private key, then?   I understand that I won't be able to derive the public key without computer intervention.  
@_date: 2017-01-29 19:03:39
Thanks!! Will check this out
@_date: 2017-01-29 17:49:43
Thanks.  To clarify I never intended to generate my own public key.  I would, however, like to manually generate a private key and feed it into an offline app or program  to calculate the public key, if possible.  I guess that's my question.  Sorry, I should have been  more specific.

The man, the myth, the legend himself!  I was at a wedding last month. I met a gentleman from Pittsburgh, where the Hell in a Cell to which you occasionally refer apparently took place. We discussed the city and growing up there. Somehow, for some reason, against all odds, and completely out of the blue, he mentioned that he attended the Hell in a Cell where Undertaker threw mankind through yada yada whatever. This apparently was the seminal moment of the poor man's childhood growing up in Pittsburgh. He denied even going on Reddit, but I have my doubts. was that you?? You owe me another shot of tequila!
