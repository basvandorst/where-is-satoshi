It's an answer to those who claim Bitcoin mining is harmful to the environment

@_date: 2017-12-15 23:03:49
Nah your doing it right imo
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:42:19
Why is that not accepted here?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:48:20
I would wait to see if it gets back into the 13K range
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:59:13
How so? I've tried everything but know nothing about it
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:40:44
The wallet ID it safe to post the private key is not
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:43:04
Ah, fair enough
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:44:38
too if you want it

Are you responsible for security? Is that individual running a VPN to the bank first? I'm legitimately curious as to what's going on
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:16:11
I still use it to buy drugs. Does that count?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:19:19
Does that mean you just have to resend?

Worked IT at a bank, this doesn't make sense. Only thing I can think if is they are possibly initiating wires directly which is usually limited certain bank staff.

I'm still buying like a mother fucker. I have a full-time job but I have been ordering on the weekends pulling in about 700 bucks and pouring it all into Bitcoin regardless of price
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:13:45
Godspeed. I'm up 7k so something is working
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:48:33
By the way is there a way coinbase can calculate your dollar cost average for
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:51:12
Did these hold all altcoins or just Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:48:10
Not it every scenario
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:49:35
Fuck him
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:04:01
I'd love that

I don't know if it offers any help but when I was 15 our house burnt down and was complete loss. We literally lost every material possession but thank God everybody was safe. It was jarring at first but after insurance steps in and things start to get rebuilt you realize what actually matters in life. In a weird way it's kind of beneficial. You'll end up a new appreciation for the small things and probably in a better or rebuilt house worth more money. It's one of those things that is truly a blessing in disguise

I'm closing my account
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:48:17
This mean by brain break
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:13:52
Ok stupid question. I have to manually enter all my current holdings from coinbase into something like Delta?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:38:42
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:40:44
My bad ☺️
