And you can bet that these people "distancing" themselves are covering their ass. There's no way you go to a guys private island, more than once, where he fucks underage girls, and are not involved in any way.
That's just a portion of the american connection. Don't forget the Saudi and emirate princes. Do a little digging around. Its pretty disgusting.

The best part about this is you don't need a bank account for bitcoin.
Seems to me that Barclay's is trying to keep itself relevant rather than make bitcoin relevant.

This whole thing was a show trial. Let's burn the witch in the town square for all to see.
Is Ross guilty of facilitating illegal transactions? Yes he is, by his own admission. But that's not the point 
Life in prison for a white collar crime? 
Most of the prosecution's evidence was not admissible under law, and the judge did not allow a whole lot of the defense's evidence on weak grounds.
The whole thing was rigged.
Should Ross get a sentence? We'll under law, sure, even though I disagree with the drug laws, he is guilty of a crime even if he did nothing morally wrong. Its bullshit but its currently the law. But life without parole? For hosting a flea market? That is absolutely insane.

Bitcoin divides into units as small as 8 decimal points below 1. .
That smallest unit is a satoshi. So         .00000001 bitcoin is a satoshi
It is also the "name" of the person who made bitcoin.

First of all, he was not charged with, much less convicted of, such a crime.
So this has no bearing on the case.

I was looking for one very important point to see if I should take this guy seriously, and he made it.
The first fiat currency was created by King Henry I in order to break the monopoly that the bank of england had on money. It was called a tally stick, and it consisted of a stick with triangular notches cut into one side and then the protruding portions cut off. The sticks were kept and the pieces were distributed as currency. This was done to prevent counterfeiting so that the number of pieces matched up to the sticks. This type of concept had already been used for many things, like deeds to land and cargo, and debt records.
He realized one important thing. If you can pay taxes with the currency it immediately has value. He didnt have the power to end the bank of england's currency, buthe did have the power to collect taxes how he saw fit.
 And this is where bitcoin is lacking. You cannot pay taxes with bitcoin. Until this is corrected it can be regarded as a financial instrument, not a currency.
But he misses a lot about it. Just because it cannot be regarded as a currency due to one issue does not mean it lacks value. It is as propped up on itself as any other currency. All modern currencies derive their value from demand for them.
Most importantly though, is that it is stable in production and has no issuer. The "same thing" we currently have involve merchants, wire transfers, expensive fees, and private production subject to economic meddling. Not to mention to use it digitally you cannot possess it but must contract a bank to do that for you. Bitcoin does well because there is transparency and security, and because you possess the currency itself. This is where it derives its demand (and subsequently its value), not taxes. He chalks this up to "libertarian ideology" but what he fails to understand is that these traits give real, tangible value to bitcoin.
I don't think he wants to have to admit that he isn't an expert at something. He is stuck in his classroom in college and refuses to acknowledge a changing economic landscape. Not to mention he has politicized this in his mind and has some conflicting political ideologies that are blurring his perspective on the matter.
The man understands economics, and all the bad talk surrounding his comments made me want to point out that one key point he made. Do not underestimate the value that comes to something when you can pay taxes with it. Taxes are collected under threat of incarceration. This threat drives people to pay them and thus deal in instruments with which you can pay them.
But for the most part the man is in the dark about how all this stuff works.

It does not have a mining asic. It does have their software on it.
It does mine, but not for profit exactly. It mines with the GPU on it in order to enable the user to collect transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-09-26 23:02:13
Don't get one.
Its a 35 dollar computer in a 15 dollar case for 400 bucks.
The software is what they are selling and you can probably put something together yourself with the software and all for 60 bucks.
If you wanna spend 400 bucks just go buy bitcoin.

Its a raspberry pi with an SD card, a case, and a precompiled Linux is with some bitcoin software on it.

The Jews=/=Israel?
The country was founded "to provide for a Jewish homeland". The flag is the star of David. All Jewish people can immediately become citizens of Israel because Israel specifically provides for this in their constitution. Israel is literally the name of the supposed direct ancestor of all of the Jews.
Don't be naïve.
For the record I am 100% against united states financial and military support for the that country.
But there's no successful Jew/Zionist/Israeli conspiracy to be actors in Hollywood/rich guys or any of that. If you want to understand why they are so successful look up the term " ethnocentricism".

That's perfectly fine. There's nothing wrong with people incurring debt of their own volition.
Its when a currency is based on debt that you have a situation.
Its not that we should end debt, make it illegal, or any of that nonsense. But we shouldn't be using a currency that requires debt to function.

Absolutely right. Trade through exchanges all you want, but always pull it out of the exchange.
The thing is, out of laziness, people will forgo one of the most powerful traits of bitcoin. Don't treat an exchange like a bank when you don't need a bank.

And any evidence they collected could be used to throw the trial out if it led to his conviction.
He has to submit to an appeals court and they have to rule first, but this could be good for Ross.

Oh, bitcoin will surpass 1000... It will surpass 100k...
Eventually. Nobody knows when. But bitcoin has nowhere to go but up.
I think this recent volatility tells me that within the next 6 months we will see it go above 1k. I could be wrong. I don't think it will settle there, but I think it will spike close to 2k some time soon.

I say this now and I've been saying this for years.
Those Chinese "ghost cities" they've built that were on the news a few years ago? The ones that are too expensive for Chinese people to afford to live in? Those are very connected to what's happening with the currency.
The Chinese know they have a bubble. More specifically a labor bubble. So they intentionally stimulated it by building cities. It enabled them to employ people new deal style while also using a then strong Yuan to pay for all of these cities to be built.
When the bubble burst and their money devalues its going to cause a recall of loans. The loss of investment in these cities is going to cause the housing to devalue.
After this a slow climb for their currency is going to cause a migration into these cities. Once they are filled up china has a much stronger economy less dependent on foreign investment.
Their planners did their math, dropped their ideology and they made some extremely smart moves. It's brilliant really. They anticipated a natural correction and formulated their plans to allow it to help them. You watch, this is exactly how all of this is going to play out.

These things happen naturally.
But this new social structure won't be based on nation states. They might still exist, but it won't be based on that. But future interaction will likely be dominated by free association.
Decentralized (and easily hidden) money, worldwide encrypted communication, automated cheap travel, and blockchain technology... oh man what you can do with that, medical records, property titles, all just the tip of the iceberg.
Corporations will play a huge role in the future world though. Not in the negative light as they do today. For example, we are on the verge of not needing banks. That level of control will slowly fade for most corporations. But we need the likes of Google. With or without countries. But the public already owns 51% of Google, so its not so bad.
New social systems become predominant only when there is need for them and existing structures can do nothing about it. After that power structures adapt, they acquiesce in order to continue existing. But the next social systems will be naturally decentralized. It leaves little room for a lot of the unnatural power structures that exist now.

It doesn't have to be centrally stored.
Blockchain tech can handle this. You'd be amazed at what it can do. It can pretty much replace all centralized record keeping. Imagine that there is 0 dispute over who owns a TV because the serial number is on the blockchain associated with your ID. You'd really not need much of a government after that.
@_date: 2015-10-19 00:16:10
Yeah if you're smart, you can buy their currency at the black market rate and exchange it at the government rate.
I'm sure it would be hard to find someone though willing to buy them back, but if it's the government backed rate I'm sure there's a government backed exchange.
