History, maybe? Bitcoin is known for many things, being good storage of value is [not one of them](

Not exactly. dogecoin or something similar that uses smaller transaction fee is more suitable for this purpose. Tansaction fee is 0.0001 BTC ~= 0.03 USD isn't really good for microtransaction.

I can see how they add up for changetip owners thanks to 1% withdraw  fee since 2015. I fail to see how they significantly add up for average Joe. 
In order for these pennies to add up to something that Joe Average would be interested enough, there need be a large pool of tippers for Joe. And they must tip not bits, not cents, not even dollars, but dozens or hundreds of dollars.

Dear Americans, Rouble is all over news now. With this exposure think how many people will jump on the sweet 17% interest rate. Buy cheap Rouble, it's going на луну.

You missed the part where bitcoin is volatile(remember price 1 year ago?), easy to manipulate(bearwhale), and requires "be your bank" .


Literally everyone knows that drug dealing is profitable venture. The key words here are "drug dealing", not "bitcoin". 


I'm so angry that I never got to sell heroin to become millionare! Or [slaves]( That's good idea too.

Short answer: a lot.


That's ~3/4 of BTC that will ever exist (21 Mbtc is the limit). 
That's more BTC than currently exist. You will not have 15.5 Mbtc until [2017](  And then you need to get all of them.
To calculate energy needed you need to calculate all energy that it'll take to mine required number of bitcoins. 
It might be more energy efficient to move 122 tonnes.


"PSA! In order to move worth of fraction of world's gold reserve we need to wait several years to either gather unmined bitcoins or wait for price to increase"


Not going to happen.

Which raises a question: what reserve must Australian airlines hold to buffer against changes in the value of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-25 09:48:27
You can't move 15 Mbtc if currently there's 13Mbtc total. 
Another 2Mbtcs are not going to fall from the sky: you need energy to get them.  That's why you can't ignore it. At least if your goal is to be honest.

Why would government want to put Chinese miners (who also can participate in making  [Fine Cutlery]( in charge of their economy?  
That sounds stupid and non-productive.
And if you are going offchain, why do they need bitcoin? Why not roll out their own system where they can control everything including fees?

Speaking of two cents.
Who will pay 2 cents (transaction fee) to transfer 0.1 of cent?
