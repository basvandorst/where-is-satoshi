I don't think crypto can beat ACH transactions, but it sure does beat Paypal to other countries right now

SEC is still concerned about protecting retail investors from crypto market manipulation, could be why they would approve a larger share price over this one.
Also, 1% of all bitcoins was $50 million at press time but worth about $1.3 billion today!

Haha mine is not that bad, but I'm reading this on my .5 btc budget level phone

I see your point, but there is a massive and legitimate freelance/gig market ie fiverr

I had this happen to me the other day because they were in another country.  $6 fee to send $30.   I said, do you have a bitcoin wallet? and the transaction was done for &lt;$0.05 fees

I recently purchased on newegg and the $1= 1mBTC conversion was really satisfying

I would love to have loss run data on a block chain. Join us at r/insurancepros to talk some insurtech. There you'll get the retail side's take on ideas

I could imagine Spiderhouse adopting bitcoin.  Just a small-time hodler here but glad to see the ATX shout out

OP may want to hedge their bet, a Trump win is paying out almost 4:1 on OneHash

I've always been determined to hodl at least until there is a good etf available because demand from the average investor will skyrocket.  That said, I'm not sure that a 'set\-and\-forget' fund like VTI would pick up BTC exposure.  They might, institutions and hedge funds will, but the biggest funds track the S&amp;P 500 and they wouldn't.

My understanding is that Bitcoin IRA offers a service to buy bitcoins and contribute them to a special  IRA wallet, and distribute them when you're old enough?  I guess the growth in value is tax-protected them if you want distributions converted back into USD?  I see much more potential for bitcoin option ETFs that can be accessed by all brokerage accounts and institutional investors

When I hear 'institutional investor', I think Teacher's Retirement Fund or Firefighters Relief Fund.  The bad corporate actors can and do navigate the current BTC exchanges, but this opens up Bitcoin for individuals with IRAs and other retirement vehicles that otherwise wouldn't have exposure to Bitcoin

This is so cool!  The 8 bit dudes are hilarious.  Honestly, I'd rather bet a money line or over/under then the 'back' and 'lay' betting options you have.  It's more intuitive to me.  
So you're not taking any spread?  What if someone doesn't take the opposite side of a bet I place?  That's a cool idea to have people post their own lines and others can choose which to give their action.  I know plenty of the Bovada market has interest in crypto, that's where I started
