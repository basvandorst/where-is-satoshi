In most civilized countries the police are not just another gang that steals your money, so withdrawing it should be fine.
The problem is inflation.

Yes in the US. But this does not happen in Central and northern Europe. And for the most part in the rest of Europe.
The killing, stealing and other criminal activities that happens remind me more of a third world country.

I am sorry if i did not add enough jpg for those who love that.

Well not om most civilized countries. Police might as a gang in US and a few places in Europe. But for the most part they are nice and helpful. Atleast here in Europe.

Memes and shit posts for me. Are you buying a lambo or Tesla? ;)

When you see the price is vertical upwards for a while stops a little then goes more up. Sell a little not all. Then when it eventually falls back again like now you buy more. Finding the perfect spot is impossible. I always go in to late and sell to early, but I am casuas so I have profit. Always take a little profit along the rising edge. Instead of all or nothing approach.
I always sell half when my coin doubles. And withdraw them for good. So I get to zero. After that you can just play around for a while. I bought  during the low dip so getting double was not hard. But be patient and do not FOMO. The hype is real.

Well everyone here says 100000 is just around the corner and the 1000000 so just hodl and you will have 10000$ at least. Or change to a promising alt to get that lambo.

Maybe they are using savants to predict the price? Savant power!

I have a questions regarding this too.
Could you not store in on a USB stick and put it into concrete fundament of something?
Or print it out on paper?
Or carve it on a solid piece of gold?
How long is an average Bitcoin privatekey? How many symbols
And with quantum computers could not this private key be gueesed? This one is bit less concrete and not important to get an answer.

Thanks. 
I know bitcoin people get off on changes inn the y axis.

Depends om your needs. If you can easily afford it keep it in. For me I can afford it, but it is nice money. 
The coins also drop so often so selling some and then buying the same amount back later for less money just feels very right and wrong at the same time.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:49:55
Yeah and it should be updated every 30 sec, because then it would be spinning highlighting your point. 
People go crazy when the price drops even if it is  relatively high prices like now. It's like if it does not go constantly up then it will all crash.
Reddit crypto discussions are mostly shitpost and memes and not serious discussions, but i can't complain as I shitpost too.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:29:56
You can so more than that, maybe fish and chips for a month! I had the same, cashed out half when it doubled in price. And then 0.01 more when it peaked yesterday. I have +130$ profit from my initial buy and still 0.04 left. So anything from now on out is pure profit :) 
Gonna use it on food or other nice things too :)
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:10:44
But what about instant profit? I bought BTC yesterday and I want my Tesla today!
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:18:43
He could not as it had a virus it was to inept to detect.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:52:35
I could post another one to get it up again?
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:22:40
Yeah. I agree, it is impossible to predict. That why I always take profit along the way. My point is that you will never sell exactly at the top or buy at the bottom so do not worry to much about it.

I do not think he knew the table was a turntable.
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:25:50
This is not a shitpost, meme or prediction. I do not really know what to do now. 
On a more serious note Reddit is not the best place for serious cc discussions, there are better places. All the cc subreddits are as you explain.
It was quiet entertaining to watch people freak out when the correction everyone had talked about kicked in. Seemed like a lot of people only though it could go up!
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:08:17
That is why you sell high and buy low. Marketing 101. It is that easy.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:44:30
That would be fun :)
