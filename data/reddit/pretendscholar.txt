Yeah the last book I read was 1984 too.

This isn't always true. Not that I support this form of stimulus, but WWII was clearly beneficial for the american economy because everyone else's manufacturing was destroyed.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little libertarian neckbeard? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in Armchair Economics, and I’ve been involved in numerous mining pools of altcoins, and I have over 300 confirmed scams. I am trained in detecting government shills and I’m the top parking-lot scammer on localbitcoins. You are nothing to me but just another conspiratard. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, aspy. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of overweight and disabled introverts across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can mine you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my cheeto-dusted hands. Not only am I extensively trained in scamming people with fake currency, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the MTGox Relief Effort (which contains cases of Mountain Dew: Code Red) and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn shill. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

I hate the fervent libertarian section of Bitcoin they sound so euphoric and uneducated.  Is there a subreddit just for discussing the technical details of Bitcoin?
