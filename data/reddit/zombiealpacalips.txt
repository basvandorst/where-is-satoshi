On U.S. currency, the series refers to the year appearing on the front of a bill, indicating when the bill's design was adopted. The printed series year does not indicate the year a bill was printed; instead it indicates the earliest year that bills of the same design were first made. For example, Series of 1882 gold certificates were being printed as late as 1927.

There are only transactions. "X amount was sent from Y address to Z address." Once a block is finalized, it cannot be changed, because everyone on the network has a copy of the finalized block. If someone tries to change it, the rest of the network will reject the change as invalid. This prevents people from trying to spend their money twice.

The entire population of earth can fit into Rhode Island, standing room only. The question is resource levels and distribution. We have plenty of resources, but fair and ethical distribution can be tricky.


Living naturally means a significantly shorter lifespan, poorer nutrition, and fewer conveniences of modern life. If everyone "lived naturally" there wouldn't be nearly enough food to feed everyone we have. Literal mass starvation.


There's really nothing stopping you from living a very simple life. You may find that you don't have to work very much to support yourself at, say, a 14th Century standard of living because our modern economy provides so much in abundance. You can ignore most of the politics and news by simply not connecting to it. Go off grid, pick berries in the forest, have at it. There are still lots of places left on earth where you can do this.
In the mean time, [read this]( It starts with the simple economy you seem to want and shows how we got to where we are today.

Socialism works reasonably well until the size of your group exceeds the number of people that one person can know personally. Once the people around you become anonymous, your incentive to contribute to their welfare diminishes significantly. Even if most people still contribute, a few will start to cheat, and eventually you run out of other people's money.

Bitcoin is somewhat regulation resistant. Where regulations are added, economic value easily flows to places where it is less regulated or unregulated, punishing jurisdictions that regulate. Cash is somewhat regulation resistant too, but it has the counterparty risk built in: banks and the U.S. government control its issuance and use.
I'd very much prefer that there were no regulations keeping me from "eating poison" at my local restaurant, because then the burden would be *on the restaurant* to *prove* to me that its food was safe. It would do this by building an enduring good reputation and by getting third party ratings and insurance companies to help make its case to the buying public. Safety regulations pass some costs from the business to the taxpayers, and the regulators themselves have no strong incentive to do a good job at actually keeping things safe.

Our education system sucks, and a big part of that is because there is very little real competition in the entire sector due to the government's massive involvement. This greatly reduces external pressures on public schools and teachers to make real improvements, because they can't really go out of business and it's very difficult to fire bad teachers. I want to opt out of it because it's a very bad deal for the cost.


Yeah, how dare I! I should just sacrifice my children's educations and futures for the good of the whole!
No. If you continue to send your children to crappy schools, you will just continued crappy schools. Trying to guilt people into continuing this bad system isn't going to make the system better. If that worked, it would have already worked.


Paying taxes funds the public schools, instead of them charging tuition directly to the students that actually go there. This means that the out of pocket cost for parents is $0. AND it forces a lot of people who have no children at all to pay too, further hiding the true per-student cost. The private schools do not have the ability to tax everyone, so they must charge people that actually go there, so the out of pocket cost is thousands of dollars. This cost, which falls on top of the taxes they already pay for the public school that they're not even using, means that many people cannot afford to go to a private school. I did not say that it was a *monopoly*; I said that it was a near-monopoly. The playing field is tilted strongly in favor of the public schools because of the tax-instead-of-tuition payment model.
Think of if we ran the grocery system the same way we run the education system. Everyone would pay $100 a week in taxes to fund the state grocery stores whether they shopped there or not. When you went to the state grocery, you would get your weekly allotment of food which would generally be terrible in taste and/or nutrition. But you wouldn't have to get out your wallet when you left, and you wouldn't starve if this were all you ate. So, those that can afford to often shop at the private groceries that have popped up around town. There aren't very many of them because most people just live on the crappy public food, but the food generally surpasses the public grocery in taste and nutrition. They charge $150 a week. The people who shop there are effectively paying $250 a week for food while everyone else is paying $100. What I want to do is stop allowing the public stores to collect $100 from everyone and only be able to charge what people are actually willing to pay for their food. They'll have to actually compete for customers now. Many of them will go out of business and the stores that can offer better food and/or lower prices will remain. If there's a cashier who only scans 2 items a minute, he's getting fired. The private stores are able to lower their prices because they now have more customers and can improve their economies of scale. Everyone wins except the poor performers, who have to step it up or find another job. If you are worried about the people not being able to afford $100 a week out of pocket, remember that a) they will no longer be paying $100 a week in taxes and b) increased competition will lower prices. If you must, it's better to put those that need it on government food benefits--usable at any store-- than it is to actually have government stores.
On the non-economic side of things, there's also some very real danger in having government-provided education: it's a built-in propaganda machine for the government. Students may learn reading, writing, and arithmetic, but they will also learn that the government is awesome and wonderful at everything it does.

To prevent double spending of any virtual coin, you have to prove that a transaction happened. The public ledger blockchain solved this problem in a decentralized manner, meaning that a bunch of people/organizations can build something trustworthy even though they have no reason to trust each other.

But you can't opt out of paying for the public schooling (via taxes), so paying tuition *again* for private school or home school expenses (including a parent staying home full time) is financially out of reach of a huge segment of the population.

An economy can function just fine with either inflation or deflation, as long as it is pretty low and *predictable*. If the (de|in)flation rate is known to everyone and it doesn't change, then everyone can price things accordingly.

We've got a genius on our hands here folks!


You literally said "Imagine the entire world had all their money in btc."
Explain to me how there could be volatility if there's only one currency. You have 7 billion people making tens to hundreds of billions of transactions every day. That many transactions means you're more likely to find a buyer or a seller for whatever you want at the price you want. The price of bitcoin, in terms of any good or service, is the average of recent transactions for that good/service in the area. If there are only 10 bitcoin to cheeseburger transactions per day, the average price is  going to jump around a lot more than if there are 10,000 bitcoin to cheeseburger transactions per day. Increased volume means decreased volatility.


Why would the good change in price that much? There were 100,000 merchants who sold the good for 1BTC in October, and suddenly in November they've all decided to sell it for 3BTC?


The more transactions there are, the less power each individual actor has to manipulate anything.


Or maybe those bank panics wouldn't have happened without Fed-sanctioned fractional reserve banking and artificially low interest rates.

I indicated that internal (monetary policy) and external (other) forces can influence purchasing power.


Economic growth should result in falling prices. If the amount of money in circulation remains the same, improvements in efficiency mean that more goods can be produced at a given cost and prices fall.
If the central bank is dumping new money into the economy at approximately the same rate that the economy is growing, then no rise in prices will be apparent (expansion of money supply is offset by naturally falling prices); however, this just means that economic growth is effectively being mopped up by the government to pay for its expansion.


Which is why I said "which makes inflation for internal reasons not a problem".

How does PopChest make money? If I send Bitcoin, does it go to a wallet controlled by the publisher, or by PopChest?
Can I watch a video by paying with Bitcoin and *not* providing my email address or otherwise signing up? Anonymous usage, in other words.
Do publishers get to know who is watching their videos?

I was thinking there'd be one bookmark, and visiting it would show you all the things you paid for. Basically the bookmark would log you in, and any purchases made while you were logged in would be linked to that bookmark.
You could prevent people from sharing the bookmark by limiting the number of video views per day or something like that.

Couldn't you just say: bookmark THIS LINK and don't lose it! And the link is something like popchest.com/?key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Visiting that secret URL would show all the videos that they've paid for. But I suppose that would cause problems with people sharing their secret links on purpose so others could watch videos for free.

Condescension much?
Just because crypto is *better* than non-crypto at numerous functions of money doesn't mean that non-crypto has "zero intrinsic value". Non-crypto has plenty of problems, but it also is (currently) highly valued around the globe.
*Neither* has "instrinsic" value.

Just because you value bitcoin over conventional currencies doesn't mean everyone else does. There is no "intrinsic" value. Things only have value if people are willing to trade other things for them.

Bitcoin is far too volatile for any actual increase or decrease in the total money supply to matter. What's happening now is that the supply of bitcoin is basically fixed, while the demand for bitcoin is growing daily.

Credit cards charge merchants big fees. Merchants must charge you more to cover those fees. With those fees drastically reduced, merchants can charge you less, and more wealth can be put toward productive use rather than paying millions of bank employees to press buttons.

They are sometimes not allowed to, due to contracts with their credit card processors. Some merchants don't because cash-handling has its own expenses too. Some merchants don't because consumers get confused or angered by different pricing structures. Some merchants prefer card-shoppers because card-shoppers spend more than cash shoppers.
If bitcoin gains critical mass, some merchants (especially in low-margin sectors) will be able to stop accepting credit cards because bitcoin could by that point offer a similar level of convenience.

Bitcoin itself can be transferred without an intermediary, which is the important part. Getting into or out of fiat is equivalent to buying some socks with bitcoin; fiat is essentially the most popular product that people buy or sell with bitcoin. *Every* transaction using any sort of payment requires two parties. Bitcoin just removes the third party needed to facilitate the transaction, and as such reduces the costs and other problems associated with having a third party.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:28:37
Good points, but I can't imagine a segregated network being big enough to have people making transactions on it without being connected to the main internet.
Probably mostly depends on the scale of the disaster, and with a big enough disaster the economic upset would probably be so great that the old blockchain would be discarded and everyone would start from scratch. Most of the pre-catastrophe coins would be unspendable afterward anyway.

which is a contradiction.
If you have dollars and want gold, or if you have gold and want bitcoin, or if you have bitcoin and want dollars, etc., you give them one thing and they give you the other, *in a face to face transaction*. If there is any distance between you, you must rely on an intermediary for dollars/gold/etc transactions, but not bitcoin. Further, dollars or other fiat currencies carry a third-party risk: the government/bank that produces the currency is able to dictate the supply of currency and therefore the value of the currency you hold, to some degree.

If there's a non-government failure, like someone figures out how to double-spend, that will destroy people's trust in bitcoin and they'll move to other cryptos (if there are any that also don't have problems).
If the only thing you can do with bitcoin is buy things governments don't like, it will still have value, but not nearly as much as without. If bitcoin is illegal to use in your country, there's not much value in using illegal currency to buy illegal drugs, because then the bitcoin is really hard to obtain in the first place, and it gives you more things to get arrested for.
