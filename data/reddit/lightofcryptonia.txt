Actually he is taking principled approach, S2X was an agreement , and he is complying with that agreement, can’t fault him for that.

All these infighting in bitcoin family is playing in the hands of vested interests who do not want mass adaption and utility of bitcoin, so that when bitcoin just becomes just a store of value, it can be made illegal or confiscated or redundant with no fiat conversion permitted, once governments make  their fiat tokens into bitcoin look alike tokens. No different than 1930’s gold situation or many Bitcoin confiscation for bogus reasons that has already happened. See what happened in China, government sneezed and bitcoin community caught a cold. When fed sneezes, entire bitcoin community around the world will catch cold, as through their veto power, all central banks will follow, as simple threat of stopping USD conversion to any non-complying currency signals the death of that currency. Wake up, smell the coffee, and yes we started this infighting, and we can stop it too. It is never too late to support entire bitcoin family , which can co-exist to fight the bigger battle.

Xapo has to act in the best interest of their customers , and block chain difficulty is the only clear objective rule they have to work from.

If only we could turn the time back and rethink our collective strategy to keep bitcoin intact. I just want to cry, we haven't learnt anything from history...not blaming anyone just ourselves for lacking foresight.

Celebrating different festivals helps to wash away inbuilt learnt prejudices. Seeking minor faults in any ceremonial activity is apathetic shield to hide behind your own prejudices and is a prime indicator of old world racism that held back human progress and it is not too dissimilar to money controllers and manipulators. I am profoundly disappointed that a bitcoiner would display such an attitude. I hope you see the light friend .

Fake or not , CSW has been around from 2009 , protecting /incubating /  mining, promoting , developing and securing Bitcoin. Regardless of your political /personal disposition, we all owe everyone who was around from that time tremendous homage. I don’t know him from bar of soap but if I met him, I will buy him and anyone who was around 2009/2010 , a drink every time. Just ask where were you in 2009/2010 before being disrespectful to founding fathers/mothers of Bitcoin, as nothing  in the universe gets invented /enhanced without collective collaboration .

John McAfee’s bet  is now absolutely null and void because of multiple Bitcoin forks caused by infighting. Mark 3:25 If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.

No, you are not paranoid , only way 1MB coin can survive is either EDA or  PoWC but it will expose the fallacy of no hard forks. Core is caught between rock and a hard place , and unless there is a secret ASIC mining hash stacked away, 1MB coin will not survive this.

You will be pleased with your accidental buy when Bitcoin reaches 100K...HODL.
