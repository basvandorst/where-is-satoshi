I don't even question the possibility ! It says it all just in the nature of its economics. Bitcoin is a DEFLATIONARY coin vs the INFLATIONARY Fiat. It is the FIRST And ONLY of its kind.
Idgaf about TA, or the shit hole of the internet (aka social media), My personal experience with crypto for the last 6 years tells me there is only one direction this is going and that's to the MOON people.
Bitcoin is to money what the internet is to information/data superhighway and fb/tw is to social media; its ease-of-use and accessibility !
The only thing I see going on through all FUD is ppl trying to figure out when to BTFD :)
NO FUD here only FOMO; strap yourself in and enjoy the ride !
Look it at another way, when Bitcoin was 20,000$ about 7 million users are utilizing it. That's **0.1% of the world population** . Which low and behold tell me it wasn't a coincidence... 0.1% of 21 million coin supply is 21,000$ / coin.
So what happens when we're at 1% of the world population :)
