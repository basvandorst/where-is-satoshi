You're probably right, that company would certainly have value. But I still don't agree with the check vs bitcoin analogy. It doesn't adequately compare the function and feature of bitcoin.

This sounds like a really great concept, I look forward to seeing it evolve. 
The one thing I'm worried most about is (especially early, when the adoption level is lower) a high ratio of "begging" posts. You give some people any inkling that they might earn free BTC and they can get pretty silly, fast. Mods might have to be extra vigilant until the sub can moderate itself. :)
I will be following this closely! Thanks.

What kind of services will expected to be offered from them? This is the first I've heard of Circle.

Upvotes for logic and cake.

Much love to an early adopter. :)

Thank you!

He just isn't equating it to the proper real-world examples. 
A check is probably more like a block in the blockchain than an actual bitcoin itself. It's the transaction itself, not the commodity. 
And I daresay checks have some pretty fatal flaws in their design and execution, nobody should be surprised they're not worth anything. 
The bitcoin protocol however...

Maybe that's a worthwhile idea to pose in r/coinflow ;) You might garner interest.

Unless it's open-source, I won't be using this. Sadly, few Canadians will even think twice about this.

They say it's a gateway currency.

Yup, my largest purchase was at 989, I am not concerned.

Thanks, really enjoyed this. :)

20% discount if you pay with bitcoin, someone's got the right idea.

Only connected to 6 nodes right now, any tips on getting connected to more people? Or is that the norm for the time being? x)

Or that $1 USD is too small and valueless as a comparison.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:27:33
Which makes me feel like another bubble is almost inevitable.

This is an exceptionally volatile weekend as well, because of bitcoin black friday. I would expect many merchants who benefited are cashing out, mixed with those who see BTC at an all-time high waiting to buy-in. 
It is no surprise that it is going down at this rate. I expect it to level off by mid-week, if sooner.

How about mibits, or millits? x)

Plus, the reporters are hired buffoons anyways. Anyone who can sit in that chair day in and day out and not realize/not care how misinformative they are being takes a special kind of stupid. 
That asian woman has Dunning-Kruger written all over her smug, inept face.

This is humorous, but also does spark an interesting thought:
What WOULD happen if, in a few years, bitcoin actually started devaluing the USD? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:17:48
Thanks! I'm really looking forward to how this progresses, I'll be using it daily.

The foreign currency of bitcoinia!

That was my intention with the comment. I thought the gif was more encouraging than discouraging. It's not too late to invest.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:15:40
Not automatic guarantee, no. But neither is the argument that current volatility == future volatility.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:54:25
Congratulations everyone :)
