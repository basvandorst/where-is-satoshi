Some forks are just "bait and switch".  If it were about principle or strategy, the differing would simply start new.  It's about stealing the wealth.

Consider mining, everyone.  It's gotta cost them less to add hash rate than to perpetuate this tactic, and they're already closer to 51% than we'd like.

Bitcoin's whole point was to not compromise.  It never was the world's largest currency, and that hasn't stopped us, or the need for it.  We always knew there would be a "Fedcoin".  Now we have several.
Compromising shouldn't be an option.  We didn't have as much hash power as we thought.  So be it.  Change algorithm, add miners, adjust difficulty protocol, etc..  Whatever is necessary to persist.
A CC that that can be cooped is't Bitcoin.  We've just gotta keep trying to make Bitcoin.  We can see the attack on first amendment in US, and freedom of speech globally, already, and so it was likely the message of Bitcoin was going to be much more greatly distorted soon.
You didn't think they were just going to let go, did you?

We already knew the answer; Decentralize all the things!
It was never going to be "give up".

I assume this posturing requires a lot of funds out of enemies of Bitcoin.  Time is on our side, no?  I wonder if the longer this goes on, the better.  It seems that they've loaded up on CCs for a sustained attack this time, but their ability to keep it up is finite.  The longer they think they have a chance, the more it will cost them.

If it ever stops it means we've lost.
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.

They are not our allies.  There is no reason to try to appease them.  Bitcoin is their enemy, and so they are ours.  The whole point is freedom from their control.

I think it was Yogie Berra who said that nobody goes to some team's games anymore.. They're always sold out.
