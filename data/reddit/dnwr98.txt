Now idk if I should buy back in or wait more 
@_date: 2018-05-12 01:30:59
Good thing I sold at $9800 
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:57:22
I can’t believe how low it’s getting I’m so glad I got out when it was around $11,000. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:54:45
Yeah till you convince them to get in and they make money and I’m all “I told you so!”
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:50:13
Bitcoin is just so hard to predict in the short term or that would be the perfect strategy. Hodl all the way.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:10:30
Thank god I bought back in at 10k despite selling at 9k
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:10:52
Here we go again
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:34:05
A surprise to be sure
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:42:46
Exactly! Some of these people...
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:53:10
If it keeps going the rate it’s going it doesn’t matter.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:16:35
Yeah the fees are less
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:45:42
Well looks like I’m gonna have to start mining again
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:13:20
To wake up to 13k omg
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:58:35
For everyone saying coinbase was down was that regular coinbase because pro was just fine?
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:57:50
Who else is watching the debate?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:13:15
Here we go again
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:54:50
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:34:59
Yeah I know that’s why I used my debit card even though the fees are higher
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:29:44
Yeah learned that lesson
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:52:39
Let’s hope it’s not a repeat of the last time it got to $9000
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:06:39
OH MY GOD
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:49:47
That was scary but no panic selling
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:11:39
Me too... me too... I bought back in at 10k at least though
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:59:05
It could very well go to 13k or 11k that’s up to you.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:32:40
In fact I even set it at 8890 in case it did that and it STILL sold :/
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:32:57
Well fuck
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:52:19
The struggle
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:26:13
I wouldn’t recommend that because I did that when it was around 9k and it went below 9k then up again while I was asleep and I had to buy back in at 10k. Just hodl.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:22:09
That may be an exaggeration but it was pretty stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:40:18
Bought at 8.5k then pulled out at 11.2k then bought back in at 11.6k �� dumbest decision I’ve ever made in my life. And stupid Coinbase takes forever for the transaction to go through I’m just watching my money go down unable to do anything. ��
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:46:30
Is GDAX really better than Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:55:20
I haven’t taken a loss yet but at the rate bitcoin is going and I can’t do anything until Saturday 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:03:51
That is true, I just get worried watching it go down. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:45:55
Why is it going down so much? Complete opposite of yesterday...
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:16:24
If I sold at 8000+ but before I break even and bought right now would I have more bitcoin than originally?
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:26:38
What the hell is going on?
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:18:17
Hodl or cash out now that I broke even?
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:04:03
As Dutch van der Linde once said: Just gotta have some faith.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:16:20
9K time!!!
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:50:19
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:10:07
Well that was the plan but I’ve been down since last year.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:17:43
I thought about it but it was too confusing to me :/
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:11:56
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:48:23
Good thing I didn’t panic sell the other day.
