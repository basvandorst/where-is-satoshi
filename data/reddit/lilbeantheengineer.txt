I remember getting the free AOL discs so I can access the internet. That free subscription was my research, and it was for a lot of other people too! To be honest, if it wasn’t for that I probably wouldn’t have had internet until somebody I knew showed me how powerful it was. So yeah, I think people should at least know what they are buying before they buy it, at least a simplistic explanation. It doesn’t have to be super in depth, just enough for a layman to understand the differences.

So people shouldn’t do research before investing money in a new technology? Sounds rather unwise.

No, but last time I checked I did not need to invest money to setup an email account.

I like how this argument doesn’t provide any real criticism ��

Just out of curiosity, what do you guys think the fee for each transaction would be?

Explain why LTC median fees are higher than BCH median fees, even though LTC handles less transactions per day?

Low fees because it doesn’t have replace by fee

Yo, we’ll see what’s good when I pull up

Do you still consider BTC to be eCash?

I guess it makes sense for you to not understand the technicals behind the protocol you seem to support. 
BCH...bcash, Call it whatever you want at least it b(e)-cash, unlike ur fee hungry ass BTC thing you call a store of value.

When you accidentally have low fees ��
