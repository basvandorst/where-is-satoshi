If you tip me 50 cents, I promise I will give $2 to a homeless guy tomorrow. I'm still trying to figure out how this works, and I think that would be very helpful.

This was a useless meme comment.

Lol, it's worth fucking nothing. You get some shitty "advanced" features which gets you into a subreddit that is really fucking stupid. And the "advanced" features you get are not very good, like loading extra comments. You're better off getting RES ( and then getting all the features on reddit you want from that (it's the best, if you didn't already know about it, I have no idea if you know about it). Anyways, you are fucking hilarious. 
Edit: It's seen as a very nice gesture though.

We all understood the reference.

That's hilarious, really. You should get an award for your wit.

If vorter wants me to do that, I would do that instead. My deal is with him. Could I even use USD though? The point was to get a (fraction) bitcoin and figure out what I am doing, because I think it would be very helpful to me. He sent me 50 cents worth of bitcoin, and I'm going to find a homeless guy and give him $3 in exchange (and post a picture if the guy is ok with it [if he's not ok with it I'll just give him the 3 dollars, and then give 3 dollars to another guy also, is what would end up happening]). That's a pretty good deal for everyone I think. 
Edit: I also really have no idea what Sean's Outpost is, but I assume it is pretty good. I went to the website, but it said to donate bitcoin for meals. Well, I don't have any bitcoins, and the point was to figure it out a little better (bitcoins), by having a tiny amount of bitcoin. But again, the deal was with vorter, so the $3 will be to the homeless guy, unless he wants something else with the $3. And there will be a happy picture too. I'll try to do it tomorrow, but it depends if there are homeless guys around (really, where I live sometimes it's hard to find them, but I will try my best tomorrow).

I was kidding. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 09:01:56
Yes, perhaps.

That's a good deal I think (lol), but really, I don't know how to tip 1 bitcoin in the first place. I know there is a subreddit, though. I'll up my offer to $3 to the homeless guy, however (for 50 cents of bitcoin - or less, the amount doesn't matter), and get an OC picture of him with his 3 new dollars, and post it here as a comment (with his permission of course).

I will. I couldn't find a homeless guy today. But tomorrow I will be looking. $3 to a homeless guy (I upped it in another comment) and a picture to post (with his approval of course). Awesome, thank you. There's not a lot of homeless people where I live, but I will be actively looking, and I will definitely follow through. 
Edit: I still couldn't find a homeless guy. But, I am working on it, and looking everywhere to give some homeless guy $3. I'll keep you updated. 4/12/13 ... But when I accomplish this, you will be surprised a little bit.

It's meth. Most of the time it's meth.

I really don't know why you got downvoted so much for that, that's a bit ridiculous. I just got 50 cents in bitcoin from someone here. Once I figure out what I am doing, I'm going to send you some cents in bitcoin as a gesture (like an upvote).
