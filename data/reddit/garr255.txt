Two years ago I wrote a tutorial describing exactly how anyone can create an alt coin with very little effort and computer skills. My intentions were to make it so utterly apparent that if a coin does not make some kind of advancement, then it is no better than the one next to it. Unfortunately these scummy people just saw it as an opportunity to market the heck out of a fundamentally identical program. I suppose the thought that one can be a part of "the next bitcoin", while too good to be true, is difficult for many to disregard. Pity.

Thanks for sharing this! I did this as a math project in high school in 2009 and nobody knew what bitcoin was thus it wasn't cool :P Also I did it at the pace of 0.77 hashes per day ;)

Oh the Cleavlander! In January during the bitcoin conference, my friend/parter and I both wanted to get to the bit-pay party on the rooftop, for networking purposes. Of course, being 17 and 18 years old, it wasn't going to be easy. I decided we should eat inside, past their little bouncer booth. When the waitress was out of sight we left money on the table and booked it for the stairs, which later were heavily guarded. We made it up to the top, and without waiting in the terribly long queue for the elevator. Boy was that a great evening!

The answer is yes, mining is still extremely profitable IF you get in on an ASIC hardware order that has already been placed. Currently the only way to do this is to purchase shares of mining company,
