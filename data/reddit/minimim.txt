The Linux Foundation is involved because they are a neutral forum to develop open-source technologies it's members are interested in [(they harbor many projects besides the linux kernel)]( It's open source because it's the only way to avoid bickering and infighting between solutions, and because it creates trust (linux is the only product used by every one of Fortune's 500).
Granted, it's a technical association of big companies, not for the small guy, but it does make sense to start the project there, as it's the only place big business can collaborate right now.

The next generation, Z, is the most conservative in a long time.
They didn't vote now but will in the next ones.
You could tap there.

How do they register those transactions? They certainly don't follow Brazilian bank or exchange regulations (their legal position around here is that bitcoin isn't money or property at all, just a protocol), and normal commerce regulations certainly don't register every transaction in the fiscal book, only inbound and outbound transactions (the bank registers it from it's side though, to pay a tax on bank transactions). So, moving bits around (that's how they paint it) in Brazil won't increase your taxes at all.

Not if the exchanges are doing the manipulation themselves. Taking a fee from their own accounts won't have any real effect.
