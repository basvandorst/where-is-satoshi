This is irrelevant.
Oil pricing in USD increases the demand for dollars and hence, its value (part of what people mean when they make the claim that the US has been exporting its inflation for years.)
This is something entirely different than "backing" though.  
Words and meanings are important and cannot just be confused or conflated willy-nilly.

Mainstream vendors would start accepting them if their customers wanted to spend them.

There is a high demand for an anonymous electronic currency.  Unfortunately, that demand is mostly to facilitate illegal activities. 
If mainstream vendors start accepting them for payment before governments figure out how to shut down the illegal commerce they facilitate, they have a reasonably bright future.

Good Lord, no.  Large holders of bitcoins are nothing like the US Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve can print as much money as it likes.  The Federal Reserve has the mandate to use inflation to maintain stable and steadily rising prices.  Large holders of bitcoins don't have that mandate, and couldn't do that if they wanted.  
People who have a lot of bitcoins would be wealthy, nothing more.

No.  This "fact" is not true.  
For a currency to be backed requires:
1.  Fixed exchange rate between the currency and whatever backs it.
2.  Freely convertible at that fixed exchange rate.
The relationship between the dollar and oil meets neither criteria.
