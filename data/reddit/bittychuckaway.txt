I believe likening it to the fine art market is more accurate. Bitcoin only has value as long as people believe it is valuable -and I mean bitcoin not the technology in general...
There are limited quantities availible . Its an option for wealthy people to store value while avoiding tax, all while being able to claim noble motives that may or may not apply. While there are multiple good block chain currencys only a few can reach the moon ( just like there are lots of artists but only one picasso ) . What does this mean ? Well in my eyes if hopes are high and talk is positive there will be n ,ew buyers and value will increase . So everyone lighten the heck up and enjoy the ride

Above all I think bitcoin is running on hype right now but whether that ends or not depends on how we act now . I think the gold comparision isnt quite right .
