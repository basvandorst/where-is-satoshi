I wish I could "double spend" what I sent and when the transaction was to get confirmed it would get rejected. I would instead trade does BTC right now to something else. Now I am just stuck waiting right, no way around it?

Thanks for the suggestion! I read [a great post]( comparing the two and I think I understand it.
If I was sending from one exchange to another (both accounts belonging to myself), what can I do to use one or the other?
From the exchange that I used to send, I don't have those Bitcoins anymore and I don't see how I could use replace-by-fee. From the account receiving the Bitcoins, I can't see the transaction yet, so how could I use child-pays-for-parent?
Thanks for your help, I'm learning a bunch of new stuff hehe :)

So the transaction fee is at 138 satoshis per byte. I can see that from the first link you gave me it is in the dark grey area, but I am not sure how to analyze that.
Is only the top level getting confirmed or some miners actually mine does lower levels?

Haha nice there is even a bot telling me how shi**y my english is :D

Also could the transaction just remain there for 2 years if the transaction fee put by the exchange is too low and that there are always higher fee transactions before mine?

Yes I have the transaction hash from where I sent it. When I view the transaction on blockchain.info (which includes many more transactions than mine), the total input appears to be 16 BTC and the transaction fee is 0.01448016 BTC. Does that tell you anything as far as how long it could take to confirm?

Ok thanks, it would be nice to be able to choose the fee as with ETH. Or maybe it's already possible and I'm not aware of it?
Edit: Normally I withdraw from a different exchange and it takes about 5-10 minutes for my transaction to reach my wallet but now I am surprised to see it take so long.

I will give you an example why the prices of an altcoin can drop when Bitcoin's price drops.
Let's say some guy is holding 10 coins (whichever altcoin it may be) and he wants to trade them for Bitcoin (most altcoins trade for BTC on exchanges). This guy places a limit order to sell his 10 coins for $2,000 each while the BTC is worth for example $20,000 (10 coins for 1 BTC).
Now imagine that the Bitcoin price drops to $15,000. All the sudden, that limit order is not worth $20,000 but only $15,000 as the value of BTC dropped. So all those limit orders that have not been changed are selling at a discount because of BTC price drop. This causes the altcoin's price to drop as it is selling for a cheaper amount.
