You could absolutely run a backend script to do this stuff for you. But for the average user this isn't feasible and currently they are getting charged 1-2k by accountants to get it sorted. This app is to help those guys out rather then getting them slapped with a fat bill along with heavy tax rates.

I have been thinking about an electron app. My biggest hesitation is a) resistance from people downloading software from the internet related to crypto b) haven't used electron before so wasn't my first choice.
But yeah an electron app is definitely something I am exploring.

Good work with getting feedback on the wiki :)

Well fortunately the tech has moved beyond SQL injection attacks. The data resides on a json-like DB ran by Google and when you hit delete as per their policy and mine it will be deleted. 
Or maybe Google is lying. But overall I would be more concerned about the security of these centralised exchanges who are the originators of this transaction history and use a decentralized exchange. Then your data is on the public blockchain and no need to store anything. I do this where possible but obviously at some point when dealing with CEX's you have to read some data from somewhere.

Hey, you can give  a go. It has Dex/coinswap support for Shapeshift etc out the box.
Disclaimer: I'm the developer behind the app :)

Hmmmm if you have only traded on centralised exchanges and moved fiat into and out of your bank account like most of my users then I would recommend paying taxes...

The user has the option to save transaction data in the app. If they delete it it's completely wiped from system. Data is stored encrypted at rest. In terms of API calls I try to do as much as possible on the client side as it costs me less and has the side benefit of being more secure. 
I also only ask for CSV imports or read only API keys. I would not trust a third party with write access API keys and neither should anyone else.

Hopefully my Bitcoin will be worth more given this strategy...

1. Categorisation means that it can work out the cost basis from the category and assign similar trades to the same category.
2. Fees are usually detailed by the exchange and this is added to cost basis where possible. Same with gas etc
3. USD is decided based on exchange data at time of trade, or if not available then a basket of exchanges
4. Lots of maintenance :-p. I essentially have to manually map this.

Hey everyone, I am the founder of [myCryptoTaxCalculator.com](
I made the tool because doing my crypto taxes was extremely frustrating and was taking a lot longer then I thought it should when using other tools out there. The UX is designed to be as friendly and fast as possible.
It supports
\- 65 exchanges
\- CSV and api read only imports
\- ICOs
\- aidrops
\-mining rewards
\- OTC trading
Let me know if you have any questions

Thanks for the positive feedback :)

a) yes :)
b) I tried using the two mainstream solutions. One did not support the exchanges I need. The other I actually bought and wrestled with for three days. As soon as you start doing things like ICOs or Dex transactions things start to get very frustrating. And that's before you starting looking at including transaction fees and manually importing exchanges that aren't covered.
- better overall support for modern day crypto use cases including ICOs, airdrops, Dex trades, pools
- focus on wider coverage of exchanges
- smoother UX

Sweet ye just wanted to build a prototype in something I was most familiar with but now that it is up and running I am definitely gonna look into this. Will let you know if i need any help! Cheers

Hey it currently supports FIFO however I am looking at supporting other options. What would you want supported?
@_date: 2019-01-31 21:45:33
Hey, I am the founder of [myCryptoTaxCalculator.com]( and just released a **FREE** version of the platform which you can use to get an estimate of your tax liability.
It supports
* 65 exchanges
* export for Turbo Tax / IRS format
* ICO's, airdrops, mining rewards
* FIFO/LIFO
* Anonymous guest user access

In this day and age that is mostly correct. You should only ever enter non sensitive data. It is up to the user to decide what they are willing to share.

Thanks for the feedback :). Just lots of coding after work on weekdays. Would like to make it opensource if I can get some funding from somewhere to cover the expenses. Been applying to a few crypto funds, will see how it goes.

Just send 10btc to this address: c2755829192'(
But in all seriousness the user has full control of their data and I do not interact with third party advertisers networks etc as per T&amp;C
@_date: 2019-01-14 10:03:04
As a simple online calculator I am not obliged to store data for government records etc and if you want your data wiped you just need to hit delete. I also don't collect any personal information beyond anonymous transaction history.
This is very different to the centralised exchanges most of the users are engaging with in the first place.
