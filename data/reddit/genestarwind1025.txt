Specific identification is an enormous task if someone uses bit coin day to day.
The amount of accounting leg work and know how needed to track this properly for IRS purposes will be beyond the ken of even the most technically savvy bit coin user.

When you mine it and it becomes yours you must recognize gross receipts.
Bitcoin Asset -------------------1000.00
Gross Receipts -----------------------------1000.00
Exchange of Bitcoin for cash
Bitcoin Asset--------------------------------1,000
Gain on Sale of Bitcoin-------------------------200
The business of mining bitcoins is different than the business of gardening, because the IRS says so.  They get to do that because they write the rules.  If you disagree, you have to sue them in appeals court in response to an audit or force a policy change through congress.
You pay income taxes according to how the IRS decides to tax it, not how you want it to be taxed.
The 1000$ of gross receipts would be taxed at ordinary income rates subject to self employment tax.
Depending on the facts and circumstances, the $200 gain in the above scenario could be taxed as either capital gains or additional ordinary income depending on the facts.  The IRS could disagree with either treatment and force the other treatment on audit.
All of this is theoretical, but ya know, that's my take on what is happening.

Life style audits where they watch your house are nearly non existent due to manpower shortages and funding cuts to the IRS.

The IRS is treating them as property, it doesn't surprise me that the u.s. govt is selling them at auction.
What this does is the govt is acknowledging they have value.  If they were selling baseballs cards it would be the same result.  They are selling it because it has value not because they are legitimizing it.

You're blatant refusal to see the difference between the two is kind of entertaining.
Halo players are not generating digital assets they can go exchange for goods and services.

Buying and selling something that is a collectible item is legal.

Shooting the messenger who is trying to help others understand what the IRS is going to do makes you a moron.

It just saddens me that they are analyzing your banking habits and freezing your assets for doing something they don't like.  They didn't just shut it down, they froze his assets.
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:52:59
My phrasing is awful.
I guess I'm just saying its like they are selling baseball cards.
The government is recognizing that something has value and they are selling it.  That doesn't than mean that they are saying bitcoin is currency.

TIL - chase bank can shut down your bank account for legal transactions specifically sanctioned by such organizations such as the IRS as taxable and legitimate.

My mistake.

From personal experience, I doubt the IRS is that capable.

If you paid 100btc for the rig setup, did it pay itself off?

Purchasing, programming, installing and running a piece of equipment to generate currency makes you self employed according to the IRS.

If I remember my hippa correctly, it applies to the person holding the information.  Doesn't mean that the IRS isn't in the wrong, it just means that isn't why.

I've never seen the IRS contact a vendor or a third party when auditing someone.
 I'm not barring the possibility, I just doubt it.

The IRS can request records its entitled to from an employer.  There are a lot of forms your employer is required to file.
That being said, the IRS probably got ahold of something accidentally in the case you are thinking about.
@_date: 2014-03-27 05:24:35
I hold it will be near impossible for a daily user.  The IRS rules are going to be so impractical to enforce, that I can't imagine what an audit involving bit coin would entail.

If the exchanges are forced to collect your social and give you a form, you will be in the dragnet.

I am not surprised by the fact that people who wish to remain semi-anonymous are paying for porn with bitcoin.
Makes sense to me.

States and municipalities can also produce currency.  The guy is a fucking moron.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:10:55
That's an assumption. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:36:57
So as a part of this they can freeze your assets indefinitely?  Don't forget, they froze his assets, they didn't just close his accounts.

Not mentioned in your post above is that when coins are mined by a miner they are gross receipts for the business the day mined.
If you mine a 1000 bitcoin today, that is 1000 in receipts on your business of mining bit coin.
This generates the basis you noted above.  In order to have the basis you have to recognize the receipts.
The tracking of when bit coins are mined and at what price is going to be incredibly difficult for all parties involved (IRS and taxpayer).
@_date: 2014-03-27 05:27:35
And in the case of depreciation or a fall in price after mining, the question becomes.  Is the loss a capital loss or ordinary loss?
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:50:03
You realize they are chronically underfunded, chronically understaffed and unable to enforce the laws they have now because of this right?
They *can* do a lot of things, they won't because of man power and funding limits.
There may be one or two audits that involve bit coin that you will hear about in a few years if they go to appeals or tax court.
@_date: 2014-03-27 05:26:43
You only get basis if you report receipts on coins you mine or you pay for coins from someone else.  basis will not exist for someone who has never reported anything to the irs for past mining activities.
Someone who paid for bit coin would have the basis of what they paid.
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:09:34
Your return was not flagged for any special attention and was accepted.  No one looked at or approved anything.  The fact that you wrote bitcoin on your schedule d is irrelevant.
