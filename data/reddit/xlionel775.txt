If I sell my altcoins I can buy 70 000 satoshis, how much do I need to wait until 1 satoshi is $1?

I do think that you can have a pretty good life here. We are in EU so we can visit other European countries, you can graduate without debts and we also have the cheapest and fastest internet in the big cities. What I like the most is that the cost of living here is low. Of course if you compare Romania with developed countries then yes it does look like a shit country, shitty hospitals and roads, corruption, low wages, unemployment and others problems.
Maybe what I said isn't true or I see things wrong but that's my opinion, after all I don't have too much real-life experience because I'm 17. I used to think that Romania is a shithole too but I changed my view. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong or give me some advice if you have any. Also I would like to know why do you think Romania is utter shite.

Wait a second you can speak Romanian and you are probably from Romania ... why are you asking me this question?

Even though I already quite like my country(Romania) now I love it even more. You don't need to pay a lot to survive, we are in EU and overall it's a nice country. Also it doesn't cost a fortune to graduate.
...yes I know that in the future crypto is going to be taxed but our politicians are more interested to legalize bribery right now.
Sorry for any grammatical mistakes.
