Are you looking for people to convince you to want bitcoin?  If you're actually interested in it and not just shitposting, there are plenty of resources where you can learn and develop your own EDUCATED opinion on Bitcoin.
You can't compare Bitcoin to just any other crypto.  Maybe technology-wise to some degree, but what other crypto has the mainstream adoption and "fan base" if you want to call it that?  Right the Bitcoin is used more as a store of value versus day-to-day transactions, that's been widely known for some time now.  Yes, some "crypto descendants" are more convenient, that's why they are being used.  But none compare to the store of value that Bitcoin has.
Yes you can use Fiat which is basically an IOU.  The reason you don't see volatility in Fiat is because it's inflationary.  Unlimited supply =  not a good thing.  If you like someone else controlling your money, the value of it, and saying how to spend it, then Fiat is all for you.  Don't get me wrong fiat is definitely convenient, as much as I hate to say.  But that is only because the technology of Bitcoin has not yet caught up the visa-level transactions.
 
Bitcoin is deflationary, and purposefully so, by limiting the total number of coins to 21m.  No one can just up and "print" or mine more Bitcoin if they just feel like it.  It's also impossible to steal or hack without a private key making it a secure and trustworthy system. 
Sure there is market manipulation, but where isn't there market manipulation?  As much as I do want Bitcoin to just keep going up, I really just want the technology to succeed.  The thought of people having money or a currency they are in full control of is how it should be.  
There are more and more stories on here of banks declining coinbase, or other exchange's, deposits because the bank is acting in your "best interest."  Then you see banks like Wells Fargo who intentionally opened credit cards and bank accounts in their customer's names, without their consent or knowledge, just to meet quota.  Please tell me how that is acting in a customer's best interest?
Edit:  My daughter woke me up at 4am so I hope this doesn't sound like a rambled mess.

Heard you out, you're wearing a tin foil hat.  How would forcing the price down thwart it's use on the dark web, or the use of the dark web in general?  Plus they just released a study saying only a miniscule percentage of bitcoin transactions were happening on the dark web.  That's as dumb as saying driving the price of the USD down would prevent people from buying weed.

Thats a word for word excuse from Ver...."but, but, the white paper."  Ver parades himself as a proponent for decentralization all the while calling himself the CEO.  Evolutionary dead end?  Tell that to the price.  Here is Ver, yet again, to take advantage of people, intentionally confusing and defrauding them just because he thinks his pet project is cooler.  Its all about him, he just wants the name and recognition.  He just can't stand that his bullshit coin isnt   Wasnt there a somewhat recent article that said if BShit had the same transaction volume as Bitcoin, it would still be faced with congestion and high fees?  
Edit:  Can't really call it an evolutionary dead end when numerous developers are constantly working to clean up and improve code.  Not to mention working out the ingetration of lightning network and just looking for ways to better Bitcoin Technology.  
Big blockers are told 8mb blocks solve the problem so they listen.  The same people that think adding a lane to the freeway will decongest traffic.

WASHINGTON—Bitcoin’s partisans and foes argue endlessly about the skyrocketing price of the asset and how it should be regulated. The cryptocurrency has even sparked a feud between a senior Wall Street regulator and a top union official.
The spat occurred Thursday at the Securities and Exchange Commission, where Republican SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar chastised the AFL-CIO’s policy director, Damon Silvers, for how he treated a bitcoin expert who spoke at a recent public meeting. Mr. Silvers aggressively questioned the founder of a blockchain startup at the October meeting of the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee.
“This committee is not a Hyde Park soapbox for demagoguery and tub thumping,” Mr. Piwowar said at Thursday’s meeting of the advisory group. “Nor is it an inquisitorial star chamber.”
Mr. Silvers, who sits on the advisory committee, quickly returned fire. He asked if Mr. Piwowar meant to address him directly. Mr. Piwowar said he was speaking to the full committee. “I didn’t think you had the courage,” Mr. Silvers said, suggesting that Mr. Piwowar didn’t have the guts to call him out by name.
At the October meeting, Mr. Silvers scolded a committee witness, Adam Ludwin, who spoke about bitcoin and blockchain technology. Mr. Silvers said the bitcoin market has become a speculative bubble and demanded to know why the cryptocurrency is not considered an investment contract that the SEC regulates.
The price of bitcoin has rallied 1,500% so far this year, surging past $16,000 on Thursday, according to research site CoinDesk. Its meteoric rise has attracted crowds of eager small-time investors.
Mr. Silvers said many bitcoin experts “evade” the regulatory questions by reciting complex descriptions of the blockchain technology that underlies the cryptocurrency.
“I don’t want to hear marketing language,” Mr. Silvers said. “I am deeply, deeply frustrated with a conversation that seems to evade the law. … I am not interested in the slightest in parables or technical jargon. I am interested in law, and you have not said a single thing that is legally relevant.”
After Mr. Silvers’s criticism of Mr. Ludwin, the advisory committee’s chairman, Anne Sheehan, cut off the debate.
Mr. Ludwin, whose San Francisco-based company Chain Inc. has raised money from Khosla Ventures and Citigroup Inc., wasn’t immediately available to comment.
Mr. Silvers also sharply criticized a University of Virginia law professor at a June meeting at the SEC. Mr. Silvers said the professor, Paul Mahoney, lacked “courage” and evaded his questions about the impact of deregulatory legislation advanced by the House Financial Services Committee.
“Even you can’t bear to admit that in fact you are pushing a bill that is exactly like the ones that devastated the American public over the last 20 years, and you are knowingly doing so,” Mr. Silvers told Mr. Mahoney. “I just wish you had the courage to say so.”
Mr. Piwowar on Thursday took exception to the accusations that some witnesses faced at those recent meetings.
“Guests spend hours preparing their presentations,” Mr. Piwowar told the committee. “They travel here on their own dime, and on their own time, take our questions, respond to our comments, and sharpen our views. They come to us in good faith.”

Who exactly promises a big return when investing in bitcoin?  The top sticky on this sub is titled "Don't Invest Recklessly."  There are plenty of warnings, more recently from Coinbase, to not invest what you can't afford to lose.  If people can't do their own research on bitcoin or the technology behind it, then they are at their own mercy.


Why not?  Even though it is a non-physical asset I still have more faith in BTC than I do my $20 bills (IOU's) from a country that's almost $20,000,000,000,000 in debt.

Before we get to mass adoption people need to understand what bitcoin really is.  Not lambo memes or expectations of 1000x, they need to know how bitcoin is sound money and why it is important.   Once people learn WHY it's important then I think mass adoption will slowly follow.  It's a work in progress, you need to understand mass adoption will take time.

Yes I get all this and I certainly don't condone lying to the IRS, not what I'm trying to get at.  I'm saying what if someone had 100 BTC on coinbase ( not realistic i know).  What if they transferred out their coins but claimed to have lost them or sent them to a wrong address, ultimately resulting in you not having 100 BTC anymore.  Do you claim it as a loss?  What proof would the IRS need to show you have effectively lost your coins?  
Playing devil's advocate let's say someone transferred their BTC to cold storage but claimed they lost their coins or were hacked.  Again, what evidence would the IRS need to be convinced the coins truly were lost? 
I certainly don't have enough for the IRS to give two shits about me.  I guess I'm more curious about the lengths some people will go to skirt the inevitable tax issue.

It sounds like you need to do a bit more research on the underlying principal first.  Try going to bitcoin.org, or a host of other sites (sidebar) to learn about bitcoin.

I'm gonna say thats a big no from me.  Split the key up between deposit boxes or some other locations.  Please, for the sake of Bitcoin, do not store your private key info on google.  Obscurity and google don't really belong in the same sentence.  At the very least get a hardware wallet like a ledge nano s.

What about just giving an overview of bitcoin in general?  Six minutes seems like a short amount of time to discuss a topic you're not sure you fully understand.  Depending on the audience (if they're even familiar with bitcoin) you may lose them along the way talking about mining alone.  Might be better to hit the general bullet points and provide an overall explanation of bitcoin.  Just my two cents, either way good luck with your speech!

@_date: 2018-10-04 18:52:32
How are you local commerce?  You stated you just want to purchase BTC, through a middleman (PP), whos transactions can be reversed, which can potentially screw over the seller.  The crypto space is full of scammers so don't get salty when people are just trying to be precautious.  Bitcoin IS meant to be peer to peer but you're not providing any service in return, you simply want to purchase BTC.  Your argument falls pretty short.

Quality analysis.
tl;dr:  It will go up or down
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:09:47
I guess by definition you would technically be commerce by exchanging something of value for something of value, so I stand corrected.  But the point still remains that the exchange is not necessarily trustless because by using PP the seller is trusting that you will send the goods.  A transaction which, as multiple people stated, can be reversed.  Not saying you would do that but it's possible.

@_date: 2018-10-05 12:58:56
I don'tthink anyone sees btrash as a threat.  The frustration comes from that community falsely identifying their alt coin as the real bitcoin, literally scamming new or unsuspecting users.  If you go to r/btc, which I do for comic relief, the posts are mainly bashes on BTC, blockstream, or whatever/whoever else Roger and their tin foil hats tell them to be mad about.  Ironically enough that sub is also full of posts tracking price movement of, you guessed it, Bitcoin (not btrash).  It's almost like they think if they believe btrash is the real bitcoin enough then poof it'll happen.

Did you buy before or during the big run up?  Your post makes it sound like you purchased before the run up.  If that's the case are you depressed because you missed out on cashing out for profit, or are you depressed because you're deep in the red?  People can't make decisions for you.  If you don't agree with the "hodl" mentality then you're the only one standing in your way to cash out.  I personally like to hodl but spend and replace, can't really go wrong.

Since you went straight from coinbase to your bank there will most likely be a holding period of a few days before you see the money.  If you had withdrew from coinbase to your USD wallet, then withdrew from there in to Paypal, you'd have it instantly.

My first impression, unfortunately, is that you may have been scammed.  If it was an a party unknown to you asking for a gift card in exchange for BTC then it's almost certainly a scam.  They even asked to pay less than the BTC equivalent of the card - $425 in BTC for a $500 gift card.
As others have suggested just check the transaction ID in a block explorer and see if it was even sent.

I will echo the echo, a hardware wallet is definitely the way to go.  My vote would be for the Ledger Nano S, or Nano X since that is the next generation.

I admittedly only did this as a test with $5, wanted to see what the process was like.  I sold btc in coinbase and withdrew it to my usd wallet.  Then I withdrew the amount in my usd wallet to paypal.  I did receive a notification that the transaction could take a day but it was instantly deposited to my paypal account.
In some screenshots I saw people withdrawing straight from their btc wallet to paypal, which at that point it would be a sale.  However, it wouldn't let me withdraw directly to PP hence the reason I withdrew to usd wallet first.  In this case the sale is to the usd wallet then you can transfer instantly from there to PP.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:35:30
I know right?  All these damn people freaking out.  I mean shit, look how much the price spiked before the fork.  That didn't happen for no reason, people wanted their free money.  It's nothing but a pricing correction now that s2x was cancelled, and he who shall not be named is just taking advantage of that and pumping up BCH.  The whole way all of this went down is questionable enough.  Once the difficulty adjustment kicks in I have a feeling the BCH price will drop quick.

That was a pretty damn entertaining stream so thanks for all that contributed and kept my distracted at work!
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:17:47
Fellow architect here so congrats on bringing adoption to the industry!  Have you had any clients pay with BTC yet?  What are your main challenges or concerns (or even hopes) with offering this as a method of payment in the current market conditions?
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:11:48
From northern Ohio and can confirm.  Nothing but cold and grey skies for the next 4 months.

Look at the petro, that's the kind of "crypto" any central bank will create.  It'll just be a digitized currency they will still control.

Well that's interesting.  First off I had no idea this was going on but Benn Swan is a nut.  He got fired from his gig as a news reporter because he kept chasing conspiracy theories.
Edit:  Fellow Atlantan here

The article calls this an elaborate scam?  If people havent caught on to this shit yet then there is no helping them.

Thank you fortune teller.  And those of us who are in it for the tech and not a quick buck will see it rise again.
@_date: 2018-11-07 16:09:30
Calm your damn tits man.  All the story talks about is his pro stance on bitcoin and blockchain, which has implications for the industry.
@_date: 2018-11-17 17:19:14
If you don't agree with it, and obviously aren't smart  enough to research the topic and educate yourself, why bother to comment? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:17:30
Keep telling yourself that.  Bcashers wanted a civil war since their egos got the best of them and they split off from Bitcoin.  And what a surprise, more assholes with egos that can't play nice together are causing another rift.  This has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:00:57
Yeah because I mean obviously why would anything that the government can't control, inflate, and regulate into oblivion be allowed?   People controlling their own money?  Come on that's nonsense.
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:54:09
Just watched Ivan's last youtube video and he played a clip from an ABC dev livestream where one guy admitted they fucked up by adding the checkpoint.  Even the devs admit its  an act of centralization, but of course for the brain dead crowd at r/btc it's business as usual.  That's also the same crowd that's still trying to steal both the bch and btc ticker for the same shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-22 21:38:09
Spend and replace, still hodling and still using bitcoin as a method of payment.  Problem solved.

Not sure if he's threatening to dump the Satoshi bitcoin's that he doesn't have (because he's a lying piece of shit), or the bitcoins he'll be ordered to return to Kleiman?  He's all talk, no action.  Always an excuse of why he can't or won't prove he's Satoshi.  Fuck him.
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:47:22
Solid argument.  I'm sure there are droves of people that want to exchange a shit national "crypto" for barrels of oil.

Hah what a western white guy?  Yes your generalization is correct, congrats.  I'm not in this for the stupid memes or lambos, I appreciate the technology and innovation behind it and I'm willing to take risks to be involved.  Sorry if you're not happy with that decision, don't know what to tell you.

Wow you must be from the future if you cashed out way back on December 17, 2018.  Bitcoin was not meant to be untraceable, hence the public distributed ledger.  For someone that claims to "designed and developed the btc" you sure don't know much about it.  Enjoy retirement, if this is your first day on reddit let's hope it's your last as well.
@_date: 2018-11-18 10:35:21
Oh man give me a break, priviledged chauvinism?  How am I pushing bitcoin on oppressed and suffering people by simply choosing to use it myself?  Yes I find it interesting and have chosen to use it, how does my choice affect anyone else?  I'm not pushing it on anyone.
You can use this thing called google to see that Venezuelans are making their own choice to use Bitcoin.  Stores have begun accepting it and trading there has skyrocketed.  They themselves have chosen to use it as inflation hits 14,000%.  
I don't get your overanalyzed arugment.  So is bitcoin simply chauvinistic for existing?  Or because people (in this case Venezuelans) have the opinion that it can could be used as a hedge against inflation? 
I never said it was a perfect replacement that had to or should be used.  All I said was take the time to do reseach before you go in to attack mode. 
Edit:  Ah yes, after looking at your post history it's pretty clear you're a troll.  One who seems to somehow confuse racism for wit.  So ironic the closet racist is taking the moral highground.
"I'm still atoning for every racial joke I've told in private company.
For most of my life I never saw myself as racist though I never missed an opportunity for crude 'wit'."
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:28:02
Hmm that's an interesting thought.  I'm sure by now most people have organized this type of information in a will or some other document.  Let's say someone purchased 100BTC back in 2010, never spent any of it, and died without any mention of them.  What happens to those coins?  Are they theoretically gone forever?  Aside from how it may affect valuation, does it matter to the blockchain that there are coins that cannot, and effectively will never, be spent or enter in the ledger?  I'm still fairly new to bitcoin so pardon my ignorance.
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:51:14
Great insult man, you totally hurt my feelings with that.
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:22:53
Remember you from earlier with an account less than 3 months old?  Thanks for the sage advice but I'll pass.
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:26:21
Off topic (somewhat) but that's a beautiful fugio cent.  Is it ironic to be a bitcoiner and a coin collector?  
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:10:18
Not going to lie I've done it quite a few times, good way to skirt the additional fees of using a debit card plus I get 1% cash back.  Just pay your damn bill the day you charge it.  
I mean are these banks honestly trying to promote themselves as good guys, protecting you from an unpredictable market?  Credit cards are beyond predatory in nature.  Crypto is bad and unpredictable yet the bank has no problem with you getting a cash advance and blowing it at a casino.
The banks love to see you in debit, don't let them fool you.  They are just scared of the inevitable.  Price tank or not, the concept of Bitcoin and decentralized currencies will continue to thrive.
@_date: 2017-09-26 18:03:40
Hey a fellow Atlantan!   Was this in lower midtown?  I remember seeing a similar sign a while back.  Still looks just as shady.

Isn't it a risk going in for $6300 of your parents money without really knowing what bitcoin is?  I think you should take some time to understand it first, aka read the side bar.

I think it needs a few hundred more indicators
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:29:36
I can agree with that, saying credit cards are beyond predatory probably wasn't the best description.  I'll just say a credit card company won't be upset if you cash advance your entire balance and go into extreme debt trying to pay the balance off with 24% interest.

Repeat the question to yourself but slower, then answer it.  You're asking if it's a scam to give someone you don't know access to your bank account.  Sure, go right ahead.  I heard Elon Musk is giving away many crypto too, go check it out.

Its subjective.  When someone is right, it works.  When someone is wrong, it doesn't.  There are mathematical correlations you can make but for the most part all the "expert TA's" here are just drawing bullshit lines.  Might as well have my 3yo daughter mock up a tradingview graph.

Spend and immediately replace, that's my method.

Sirin Labs is also working on the Finney, similar in concept because it also works as cold storage.

Dude that is crazy shit.  I too only got in at $3k, my wife and I just bought our first house, just had our second daughter, and my wife wants to spend all my bitcoin at Overstock.  Sometimes it's worth it, that's the point of Bitcoin after all.  Congrats and best of luck!
@_date: 2018-07-01 22:25:46
I completely agree, I've been wanting to pick this up for quite some time.  Just dove in to it and I can't put it down.  This detail this book goes in to is fantastic, especially for someone like me who is not a coder but is familiar with it.  Is 32 too old to switch from architect to blockchain engineer?

I have to agree.  Seeing as this was the first place I learned about bitcoin, and the first place I send people to learn about it, I was really disappointed this got merged.  I've never used Paxful but from some of the stories I've read on here, it doesn't have the best reputation.
