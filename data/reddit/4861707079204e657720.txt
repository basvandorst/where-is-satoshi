It's good that it's in a frequently-travelled place.  You get a ton of commuters and businesspeople on trips who have time to kill while they're waiting for their train.  Getting some bitcoin informational material next to it would be nice.
I think the next one should be in the heart of Boston's financial district.  Even if they don't get a ton of transactions, at least it's a constant reminder for financial execs that bitcoin is real.  As they get desensitized to its presence it should make bitcoin more palatable for them.

Maybe I'm enamored with the novelty of it, but it certainly felt easier than Amazon.  I'm sure Amazon would also love to avoid credit card company fees, given their business model.
All that said, actually going through the action of paying for something with BTC made all the ideas floating around about adoption seem more realistic to me.

Cool!  My first thought is to go to and confuse them by tipping in BTC...

This is going to be my go-to video for showing people what bitcoin means.  I usually get mired down trying to explain what's going on under the hood, so to speak, when that really doesn't matter to most people.

To be fair, the magic beans took Jack to the tropopausic lair of the giants.  When bitcoin takes Jack to the moon, then we'll talk.

I bought some jewelry for the lady.  It was insanely easy, I'm talking thirty seconds from clicking on shopping cart to getting the payment confirmation from coinbase.  Heck, most of those thirty seconds were just me second-guessing my purchase before clicking the pay button.  I never really understood how easy it could be to pay with BTC, but now I can really understand how more widespread adoption could benefit consumers as well as retailers.  I'm looking at you, Amazon.

This reminds me of some exciting new global health ventures underway, companies that pursue social missions through capitalism. Color me intrigued.

Just real quick pointing something out that has nothing to do with your question:  third world refers to states that are not aligned with the ideologies of the US (first world) or the USSR (second world).  Most economists and historians prefer to use "developing countries" as it's more descriptive since the collapse of the US/USSR power structure.
