My viewpoint acknowledges that ethics in medicine is a huge deal.

Everything else too... but also cancer.
@_date: 2016-04-21 16:53:56
Even then there's a pretty big ethical issue there. The way we do it sucks, but it protects us all in the long run.
@_date: 2016-04-22 15:40:52
Because it's not just one person deciding what they do with their body.
It's family and friends that may try to pressure the person into dangerous and experimental treatments.
 It's people claiming a dying person is morally wrong for not letting people use their body as an unregulated medical playground.
It's a doctor and his researcher buddy skipping animal testing and being okay with treating humans as guinea pigs.
If it was one isolated incident, then fine. But the problem is that the doctor-patient relationship has two people involved, and that doctor will get more and more comfortable with experimenting on doomed patients, which means they will push for it more.
So, yes. I think for the greater good of humanity, we need to stick to a strict ethical code. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 18:17:19
And that experimental drug? Turns out it has nothing to do with cancer, the college just wanted to see what happens if a human takes a formula he's been playing with that may either build muscle mass or rot your liver.
That's where the ethical issue lives. A desperate person may be willing to try anything that might work.
What's to stop a company from trying random shit on people by lying about what they think it will do? The patient signed a form that says there's no guarantees and it's dangerous, and even if they get found out they can say "it could have worked, we called it experimental! We're just throwing science at a wall and seeing what sticks."
@_date: 2016-04-21 16:55:41
Because the things they did are totally equivalent!

The point of the email address is so we can tell them that this isn't the sort of story that needs to be published.
It's one thing for a government to prevent a publication from publishing a story. It's different when it's the **people** who make that decision. 
There are things that don't *need* to be published. A journalist has to make that choice, and they should face some backlash if they make the wrong choice.

Dollar bills are only worth a dollar, and they are relatively stable. I don't think it's the value of the individual unit of currency, it's the number of units in circulation.

@_date: 2014-03-07 00:07:03
I understand your argument, and it's valid. I still believe that journalists should consider the impact of what they publish vs. the benefit it can have.
As an extreme example, let's say that someone just helped put the biggest drug kingpin and gang leader in American in jail for life. The person was put into witness protection, definitely wants to stay private, and can be hurt if their location becomes publicly known. Locking up a gang leader is a HUGE deal, and his actions caused a big system shock. If you, a Journalist got ahold of their current location, would you publish it? 
Satoshi himself isn't *that* important. Nothing about who he is as a person has any impact on the currency beyond maybe his motivations for creating it- it's about the math and the community of people who support it. Say I'm an anti-social recluse who just discovered how to make a self-sustaining, energy positive fusion reactor using household garbage. If I desire to be left alone, should I refuse to share it? Why can't a person anonymously contribute to society?

No. But he would look better if he went to the police and had a blackmailer arrested, tried before a jury of his peers, and convicted (public record and accountability)- then placed in a prison for 5-10 years based on behavior if that's what society decides blackmail warrants. 
Same reason I think cops should be able to do a lot of things that vigilantes shouldn't.

Is the guy in the stupid meme this thread is about? We're talking about Ross. More specifically, I'm talking about how insane it is that there are so many people idolizing someone who makes bitcoin look so bad.
To answer your earlier question a second time:


Again, I'll say that you should probably chose a profession where you aren't in the position of going to prison for two life sentences if someone happens to reveal your name.
Yeah, the blackmailer is also a douche, but that doesn't mean Ross is anywhere close to innocent. If you're talking about having someone "executed" and are saying things like "it doesn't have to be clean", you've gone down a path that should have you removed from society.

Okay, let me spin it another way: Two websites. 
One on the shady dark net selling black market goods and services using untraceable currency featuring site-moderated sections for selling illegal goods complete with completely anonymous site moderators working to keep the process smooth. 
The other an online marketplace with non-anonymous moderators working to remove illegal listings and records of customers and payments through above-board payment methods that easily links purchases to individuals. Oh and Amazon pays taxes.

Yesterday I almost had $40. I could have bought in last year, but at the time I was in college and had very little disposable income. In retrospect I should have bought in like crazy, but in reality I made the right choice.
