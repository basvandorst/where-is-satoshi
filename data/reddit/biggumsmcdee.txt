Someone doesn't want to pay taxes.

Has it really only been 3 weeks since 10k hit?

Note every article on the right. All negative. They hate Bitcoin like they hate trump and Iran.  
This was from express.co.uk, supposedly the articles on the right are mean are 'most read in city and business'.

Holy fuck. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:21:42
Agreed. And safeguard those 175, diversify maybe 25 of them into 'stable' alts, eth, ripple iota. 
I dream I was in your position. Wow. You living then dream.

Yeah. It's bad form to give unsolicited financial advice - if it goes to 80k is uncle bob going to spot the difference? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:35:07
That's expensive pussy. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:42:18
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:31:22
Yeah but btc I'm sure he can make sure the court never finds out. Can just say made it after the divorce.

If I lived in Orlando I'd eat here just to support them. 
The fact it's on here shows the pr is working.

Hardly animated gif worthy

Bitcoin and burgers. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:20:45
So if its 101 why keep saying it?

hm I thought swiss ETF was approved?
 Roughly half (48%) of the ETF’s assets will be invested in Bitcoin (BTC) **$4630.16** **-1.61%**. The rest will be put towards bitcoin cash, XRP (30%), ethereum, and litecoin.

This is the most dumb fuck thing to say, and someone says it on every thread like this. Nobody thinks the past is a 'good indicator the the future'. The OP is just making an observation. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:13:31
lol I thought this was cnn for a moment
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:03:01
this is a good idea. If I had enough btc left to care I would. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:04:11
you could try selling them to some poor fool for the price of a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:07:46
