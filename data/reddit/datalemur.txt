"Price is the most important aspect of Bitcoin", said no one ever.

Not sure what that means.

Phew! I am pursuing a career as a Data Scientist and I am learning sql right now. I just wanted to make sure I am on a good path. I am learning python in my own time as well. Hoping to better learn the blockchain technology throughout this year.

No one should seriously consider this post as fact

"We have four trillion dollars now in monetary base and it consist of nothing but ones and zeros."
Meditate on that statement.

Was recently thinking how someone should do this

Very relaxed. I showed up in a dress suit, these guys sat down like bosses in regular clothes. We proceeded to talk about my resume and the job description. Later we talk bitcoin. It would have been nice to meet more people and have more time to dive deeper into the role. I'm crossing my fingers for a second interview - I know I can add value to the team.

I didn't research the dress code - thought suit and tie was appropriate. No technical interview, so maybe that will be on the second interview. I will keep you posted.

Why don't they just use an algorithm that simulates human behavior instead of watch it.

Bitcoin is a weird idea
