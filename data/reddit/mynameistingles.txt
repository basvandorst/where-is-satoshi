Yeah sit here and be bitter about those who succeed or actually work to improve yourself. One's easier than the other...

Here's a theoretical: My dad has an office suite in San Jose (which he pays for so no other boss there) and the rent includes electricity. He has a small room which has two email servers for his his law firm and an air conditioning unit so employees don't have to listen to fans. 
How practical would it be to pay the $300 and set the tiny box in there and then check in twice a year?

I'm 17 right now. I read about Bitcoins for the first time in Wired in 2011, and I remember hearing about them earlier when there was a shortage of some ATI video card that was being attributed to bitcoin miners going all in. 
I'm a pretty staunch libertarian so the idea of a government-free, anonymous currency really gets me going. I don't know if bitcoin will be the one to do it, but whatever it is I can imagine having a great impact. I don't have any money in bitcoins, it's something I'd love to experiment with, but I don't really have any transactions I need done. Maybe I should get into drugs or something...
OP, very impressed with your internet resume. I started Python when I was 15/16 and I wish I could say I'm anywhere near selling my code. You sort of remind me of myself, I got started with a Macbook screwing around with installing Windows for games and learning about the way computers work but finally getting frustrated with performance. I think I built my first PC when I was either your age or a year older. Keep it up man, sort of insanely jealous.

Sounds like it would make bitcoin popular with exactly 50% of kids.
