what in the world
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:14:48
I'm not poor, I'm very cautious. I didn't deposit a dime into my bank until I knew what the fees where like and what I'm looking at as far as benefits.

lol I thought I was buying bitcoin from you, wow is this for real? I am installing Electrum now.

I do appreciate that he is willing to help me out, as the only true purpose of this is to test the system and see how it works. I don't like rushing things head-on because that would definitely hurt my pockets.

Thank you, something so simple that nearly missed my train of thought!

The fact that Bitcoin is as good as cash interests me a lot.

The BITCOIN app is connected to a service with a $50 minimum? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:56:34
I spent $50 on apps that said they would invest my money into safe companies. I now have a portfolio of $9.50 lmfao

Very smart, too bad I don't have 14k to do this at the moment lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:50:01
Okay, well I guess I could throw some paychecks into it. Seems like my only options at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:19:28
Do I look like a joke to you?
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:32:21
Wait so if you know a little something about fees, care to explain the very basic fees? it sounds like you use coinbase, I just really want my hands on some bitcoin so every bit counts! and timing is of the essence.

Well said, seems like the best thing to do is just buy many coins who look promising. 
by popularity this seems to take the cake..
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:15:12
I just saw someone named Lou do this, what is her purpose?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:44:38
lol I was expecting this, love the feedback guys but I only see one good reply  which is by far the most straight forward! 
literally rolling on the floor as we speak!
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:20:42
You wont be laughing when I hold 20 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:16:45
Okay, OMW
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:47:28
I did look into this, it does seem more profitable to just buy a coin that might just rise in price which would in turn profit.
Although I do see some benefits in mining as you are working for the coins that might even be easier to hold onto for a while then sell once they have matured.

Shorting? isn't that technically illegal.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:33:40
Okay well I have never heard of these, let me get a quick overview first so I know what I'm getting myself into and see if this is something I can do right now. BRB
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:28:17
I know right.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:49:26
What exactly does this mean?
