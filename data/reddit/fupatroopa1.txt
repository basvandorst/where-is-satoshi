I just played around with some numbers.
The total US energy consumption in 2016 was ~97 quadrillion Btu:
The average energy consumption of a single bitcoin transaction is about 215 kWh = 733610 Btu.
Visa had 141 billion transactions alone in 2016:
If bitcoin were to become the global currency that everyone here hopes for, and *only* has the kind of volume that Visa currently has, that would amount to 141 billion * 733710 Btu = 1.0343901e+17 ~= *103 quadrillion* Btu.
*That's more than the entire US yearly energy consumption, just for Visa-level transaction volume!*
How can anyone seriously support bitcoin at this point? Won't energy consumption only continue to rise as mining difficulty increases? Are there vastly differing visions of how this should pan out?

Hook it up with some knowledge

Interesting answer, thanks for sharing.
I read through a few comments there as well, and tend to agree with this:

What are the real numbers then? I haven't seen any real calculations contradicting this. Is it too hard to calculate/estimate?
One thought on the wealthy/mighty participating in hacking: that's essentially where we are with today's big systems, although we have (as a society) the luxury of appointing trusted advisers for the most part. That wouldn't be the case in a trustless system.

I dug into that, and it looks like that's how the figure was calculated:
24 terawatt-hours / (300k * 365) ~= 219 kWh.
My only glaring questions from your responses: what exactly do you mean by 'securing the network'? How does 'securing the network' account for 99% of 24 terawatt-hours? Does it scale linearly with the # of transactions (and if not, how does it scale)?
Appreciate your replies.
