Merry Christmas - thank you for the giveaway! Would love the chance to win one of these :)
@_date: 2012-12-01 19:50:05
Thank you very much - Awesome idea! 
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:12:33
Also have a 128 char string starting with 8c851b, but think I'm even further away with that.. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:01:03
Can't wait to see how you managed it - would be rather funny if we'd all taken the wrong direction all along :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:45:22
Haha good on you :) good luck!
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:31:11
Got'cha - that went over my head! 
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:37:09
Oh? You found a pastebin? Looks like you got further than the rest of us then!
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:38:13
[This site]( will give you the same results, though it's a bit frustrating to use :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 09:51:48
Of course, completely understand :) I'm just stuck at the 'hash' part - I've tried a few combinations, but unless I've got my XOR result wrong I'm completely stuck.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:30:48
Ahhh.. I see now, that went completely over my head :)
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:36:53
For the future - I had best results with [this one]( I've just followed the same method as flyingapples123 using that site and arrived at the private key, so that online calculator (although finicky) can be considered reliable for this purpose.
As an aside - perhaps I'm missing something, but I never would've thought to hash the hex of the ROT string with ASCII representation of the SHA256 output. I'm not sure I'd have arrived at calculating the SHA256 of CoinGate either - either I'm missing some very obvious clue, or neither of these were particularly logical taking into account the clues given. I'd love to understand the logic behind it :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:29:12
I've got a long string of hex values for 15.. just stuck now and don't know what to do with them :(
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:48:00
So I've used ROT47, then used your key to XOR the output, now stuck at the last point - as I was last night. Am I close with a string of 256 characters that starts with this?
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:15:02
How about that hint then? :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:32:10
Off to bed.. I have a long string of hex characters starting with 7b. Feel like I'm close, just can't work this last bit out!
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:46:37
I did PM for more information, but no reply as yet. Not sure if troll :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:10:36
I'm really close with Challenge  just stuck at the final hurdle. Driving me crazy.
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:27:35
Stuck on the same thing and at the same point as you - the whole 'don't hash over it' is a bit vague, though I feel the 'skip' part of it may be the more important hint to take away?
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:42:18
I have, no luck with it though unless I'm doing something wrong.

Shame to see CeX listed here as only having a single store that accepts Bitcoin. In fact, they both [sell and exchange any electronic goods for Bitcoin on their website]( as well as across 90+ of their stores in the UK.
To be fair - they're terrible at advertising this fact, though!
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:59:43
Easy to say when you know the solution ;) this one is tough!
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:17:08
How about now? :) seems like folks are struggling more this time around!
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:11:24
I had all of the varying colour values / hex values (each I was very subtly different) and tried a bunch of different things, but just couldn't either get 12 values or a private key that worked.. Fun to try it though! 
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:02:44
It's not just 2,4 and 8 - all of the Is are different shades! It's only the third RGB value (the blue) that changes.. Not sure what to do with this though!
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:10:44
I need to sleep, so... Good luck to the other contenders :)
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:40:10
Those are definitely the right answers, I've just got the same thing.. That's meant to be the 'easiest' challenge too! I think we're looking for a straight up private key here rather than a mnemonic.. I'll keep trying :)
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:19:31
Seems a bit convenient that all 12 words in the first set start with the same letter? Could be overthinking things here though.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:49:30
Dude! Nice! What was the solution here?
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:13:05
Holy cow, I'd done half of that but just didn't click what else I had to do.. Nice one for solving it!
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:26:41
Even tougher to hear it's "not very complex".. it sure feels complex! I'm certain I'm close, but am either a few words too short or too long of a regular wallet seed.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:53:31
Thank you for the challenges! I think it's fun to post a couple of challenges, but that's just me - makes it feel like you have more of a chance of completing one before some genius jumps in and solves it first. Either way, it's great fun trying to solve these so whatever you choose I'll certainly be participating!
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:06:42
Ahh, makes sense. I didn't try this as I saw others said it wasn't working for them - looks like they might have mixed up some of the words. Nice job for solving it! I'm really curious how  was solved - feel like I was close.
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:51:15
Any reason you did it in that order in particular? I've tried a few combinations, but nothing is working. Feels very much like we're missing something here.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:52:41
Solutions posted below, I had way overcomplicated it!
