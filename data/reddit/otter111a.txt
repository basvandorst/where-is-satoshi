But if a lot of people hodl won’t that cause a price drop as the market itself recognizes that buying anything to give up your bitcoin is throwing away earnings potential?  So inevitably people looking to use crypto will use other cryptos and just hodl bitcoin see what happens.

A colleague of mine immigrated to the US a few years back and sold his house over in his previous country for a profit.  He owed taxes in the US not only on the sale but on the change in exchange rate between the time when his house was purchased and when it was sold.  
The tax man cometh.

In the movie wall st they show market manipulation.  In the movie trading places they show the main characters speculating in the futures market.

How would getting your machine hacked (where your wallet is) give anyone access to your seed if it is stored online?  The hack would only matter if you stored your seed unencrypted locally.

So I was trying to recreate that fit.  Having a real hard time of it.  
The "fit" is presented as y=2.9065*ln(x)-19.493
So, as a starting point, let's solve for an X to see what type of values we should be using for X.  
On or about 12/31/2017 the bitcoin price should hit $10,000.  
10000 = 2.9065*ln(x) - 19.493
Simplified to:
3447.271 = ln(x)
so exp (3447.271) = x  Correct?  What is the units on the abscissa then?  femtoseconds?  Because whatever number represents Dec 31 of this year is massive!!!
So I took a different approach.  Try to recreate the line in Excel then try to determine the constants.  So I cut out the graph in GIMP, imported it as a background in an excel chart and adjusted the chart accordingly.  
For Excel every incremental day = 1.  So the chart begins on day 39814.0 of excel time and ends on 45657.0.  If you do this you'll see that the creator of this chart used days of length = 370 days.  
Next up, some try my best to get the values to align with the fit.  I know this formatting is going to get screwed up but anyone following along this far should be able to extract the necessary data from it.  
40178	0.005
40543	0.5
40908	6.7
41273	45
41638	200
42004	700
42369	1800
42735	4500
43100	10000
43465	22000
43830	40000
44195	70000
44560	105000
44925	200000
45290	300000
45655	500000
Anyhow, you plot those points on a log bit coin value vs days plot and you get
y = 2,605,792.96ln(x) - 27,715,640.91
and....my fit looks nothing like the red line fit.  
So I don't know what that line represents but it doesn't appear to be represented by the equation on the chart.

I'll check later.  Thanks.  Pretty sure I enabled that when I created the wallet.  I enter a password whenever I open it.  And I used a password generator to make a really long one.

To be clear, I'm not being argumentative.  I'm trying to understand.  
When you open up your hard wallet aren't you essentially doing the same thing?  Won't that set up an instance of a wallet on your machine such that if it is compromised it's still vulnerable?

Awesome!  Don't let greed get the best of you.  As they say every time you log into an investment website, past performance is not a guarantee of future gains.

Was also doing it in app.  I have an e-mail into the customer service. Will see what happens.

How long ago?  Just wondering if maybe they have a lot more signups causing server issues.  What was difficult about getting a dL pic?

In this plot what is "X"? being used? Years?  Year-initial year?  current day - initial day?

Keeping bitcoin on a small, easily lost object rather than behind a password stored encrypted in the cloud  does not seem very safe.

Is it difficult to get verified on Coinbase?  I have tried multiple times but keep getting rejected without enough of an explanation as to why so I can do something different.

So *hypothetically* a Lastpass note would suffice.  Lastpass is encrypted and stored in the cloud.  There's no file to upload.

Everyone thinks they are going to be the one who is able to do this.

I'm very new to Bitcoin and could use some advice.  
Right now I purchase periodically purchase coins through coinbase.  When the transaction completes I move them over to an electrum wallet I have on my home computer.  As I understand it this creates an actual encrypted file on my hard drive containing my coins.  
Is it necessary to keep this file in the cloud to keep it secure?  
If my hard drive crashes I can still recover the contents of the wallet using the sequence of words, correct?  
So is it actually necessary to keep the file as long as I have the words in a secure location?  Or are we talking backup of a backup here?

I too made predictions of future stock prices based on previous trends when I first started investing.

Not an exact science or a science at all. It’s speculation and chartism. Nothing other than your guts telling you where the bottom is.

My mom was the oldest of 12.  They went 6 girls in a row before the first boy.  How bout dat!
In my generation we ended up having like 14 male cousins born before the first girl showed up.  
Ok...what's my ethnicity and upbringing?
