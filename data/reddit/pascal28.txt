Sorry, this is off topic, however, I would like to ask, whether "while" in your sentence look strange to a native English speaker or not. I am a non-native English speaker and while/whilst and amid/amidst is very confusing for me. If you or anybody else could explain that to me, it would be great. Thank you in advance.

He said it himself (in some "free advice" video) that he reads [books like these](  and books popularity charts and then gives advice [to other bimbos]( what they should read

Just for some perspective: Australia has 25 million people. Poland has 35 million people.
