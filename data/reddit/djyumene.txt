Hopefully. ��

Hopefully :) -fingers crossed- 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:53:28
It is. I've honestly never done anything like this before, so it's completely new for me.

In coinbase I got a little over $4 in Bitcoin after fees.

In coinbase it was a little over $4 after fees. But yea, was hoping to make a small return on it. I failed.

I will keep a hold on it and see what happens. :) I think that's all I can do at this point. XD
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:50:05
I'm not, but I can't stop you from believing that. :) It was a mistake and I'm learning from it.

I'm not really asking for anything, just sharing a little experience from my first time actually buying btc. But that is very sweet of you and I appreciate the offer very much. ❤
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:50:55
I'm not the type to ask for money. But thank you. :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:31:23
I hope so. I guess I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:47:22
True, it was indeed silly of me to think that it would go up fast (I shouldn't believe everything I read and watch, I've learned a lesson in all this, that's for sure.)
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:52:31
Will do for sure. Thank you. :)

I am not the type of person who begs, so that's out for me, hell I hate it when I see panhandlers on the street when I have to go somewhere. 
I mean I feel bad for those who lost much more but of course I'm looking at my own personal loss as well (again may not seem like much but for me it's a lot).

I know and that's why I never touched Bitcoin even back in the day a few years ago when it was much lower. I regretted not putting a couple dollars in when I saw current prices and I didn't want to pass up something else. After seeing news about the fork cancelled and seeing a bunch of news articles and videos saying that the fork being cancelled is the best thing that could have happened, I didn't want to miss out like I did  last time. It stupid of me to do I know.

Off topic question but why do a lot use "hodl" instead of "hold" when saying to hold onto it? Been noticing that, heh. Does it mean something else?
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:38:56
This isn't a troll... Believe me.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:41:31
For sure it was definitely a learning experience.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:48:50
For sure, thank you :) I've been trying to chalk it up as a learning experience for sure.
