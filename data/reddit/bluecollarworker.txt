I have some pretty nerdy interests but at least I'm not posting in all the time. Your life must be pretty sad if all you can do is discuss currency.

Write some more long posts that I'll skim over, dork. I like watching neckbeards like you passionately defend your stupid nerd hobbies.

Oh, sorry it took me so long to respond. Was just busy checking my stock portfolio. Yes, it seems I made all the correct choices and I've earned another 1.2 million this week. Well, good luck with your little cryptocurrency experiment! Let me know if you ever join the ranks of the multi-billionaires. Heh.

Bitcoin customers are fucking children and you prove it by calling this "spitting in their face".

If everyone had just shut up and used their bitcoins for drugs, this wouldn't have happened.
You wanted to make bitcoin big. You wanted legitimate retailers to accept it.
Now you get to pay the price - the banks will stop at nothing to keep you from using bitcoin.

No way. I thought you meant they were literally spitting in your face. Now that you've clarified this for me, it makes total sense!

Filthy rich but doesn't know what price he bought bitcoins at. Sounds legit.
