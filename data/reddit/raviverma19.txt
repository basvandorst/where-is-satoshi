Volatility. When and if the volatility dies down, vendors would accept

Transaction fees will become higher and higher as lesser and lesser bitcoins remain to be mined..when all of the coins are mined, the miners only rely on txn fees as an incentive for their work, hence it goes higher till all coins are mined and then it becomes stable I guess if the txn volumes become stable. If the txn volumes are high txn fees would be lower and vice versa. My 2 satoshi.

I suspect that most of those freaking out have got in late on the bandwagon.
Edit: I must add that I got in late too, at 12k and 15k, but I would like to believe that I have done my research and will Hodl till the Moon
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:29:06
Please elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:30:46
Good for you mate! Buy and HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:07:05
But what about ppl who got in late like at 12K$ price??
If it's going to go below 10K, I would sell and buy the dip.

From India here. Its all on the news and stuff but no way its generally adopted as of now. Very very few ppl i know have it. Infact my brother is a techie and his office folks have bought some in groups. He caught on from there and now he influenced me to buy. So its basically a network effect where it starts from techies is all i can understand. And that too ppl are vey circumspect. Its a very miniscule% adoption here.

I dont know about selling. All I hear is people holding, everyone's holding. Who's buying? Is anyone buying here?
We are at ATH right now? Makes sense to buy?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:49:16
Didnt get your reply. You mean most ppl arent buying, right? How is the value rising then?

Maybe a stupid question, but plz help. Some blog suggested me to create an address on  
and storing bitcoins from exchange to that address.
I intend to store my btc in paper wallets. Is it an issue? And is the address generated by the above site genuine/hack-proof?
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:50:23
That's it right? Don't intend to trade frequently at all. In for the long run. What about the public and private keys created by the site above. Is the site genuine?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:34:07
We are at ATH right now. Is anyone buying? Or everyone's hodling for now?

Vote up if you think that btc will rise from Monday. Vote down if you think it will fall. Lets see what happens!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:00:08
