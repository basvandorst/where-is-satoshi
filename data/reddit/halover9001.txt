On a related note, I transferred a small amount of BTC from the BTC vault to the wallet on Coinbase on January 3rd. It has yet to reach the wallet and still says pending. Wtf is the hold up

My dude it's been almost 2 weeks. It's only ~$75 worth of BTC. I was gonna transfer it out to get some altcoins. Why hasn't it gone through yet?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:15:50
Thank you so much! I was not aware of the 2 email confirmation needed to transfer between my own wallets. The more you know
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:48:23
I fuckin hope

Thank you, I appreciate the help! Also, I guessed my password correctly after about 8 tries, so I'm all good there. After sending I'm met with a sever did not answer issue, and from what I've read it's because I'm not updated. I will respond once I update and test the sending.
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:05:07
Yes I'm pretty sure. I have it written down on paper and it matches the phrase on file.
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:24:25
Oh, will downloading the latest update overwrite my wallet or anything? It says to make sure I back up my wallet/seed if upgrading from an earlier version. Since I have the seed do I just need to download the newest version?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:36
Even with the bit I have, I will HODL to the moon
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:47:17
I guess I'm just stuck on the updating part. I downloaded the newest Electrum-LTC 3.3.6.1 zip file, but how do I actually update the wallet? I can't find the electrum application file to open the wallet.
Edit: Nevermind I'm an idiot. I was looking at the wrong file the whole time. I now have the newest wallet installed and my coins are present.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:53
$20? Unless you need that money to buy food or rent, invest it and HODL
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:11:17
Weird. I created a new wallet, selected the I already have a seed prompt, typed it in (it showed it was correct and standard type), and the new wallet was created but there were no coins in it. It shows Electrum-LTC version 2.9.3.1 if that helps. Do I have to sweep the coins or something?

Well said
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:31:27
I'm a total noob to this but I'm glad I finally got in. I was upset at buying at 10.4k and 11.4k but now it looks like I made a good call haha
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:20:41
It's been rising like crazy this last week. Any dips predicted in the near future, or should I keep buying?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:48:12
I'm not seeing BCash on Coinbase. Wtf is happening? Something seems fishy, just like when it got added
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:27:30
I was to slow to record it. All I got was a picture showing $10+ increase per second for a short time. Pretty cool though
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:18:04
@_date: 2018-09-29 16:58:24
I would buy like 500 BTC at that point! What's the worst that could happen, I lose like $400? I've already lost more than that haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:56:56
There is a pretty gradual decrease happening on GDAX right now. Looks like some people are getting scared.
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:10:46
There was a price drop. About 500 down. BTC fell off it's bike again lmao
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:38:45
I've said it before, if Bitcoin ever hit $1 I'd buy as much as I could.
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:52:20
Man, I'd love to have $623 million USD.
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:12:30
Pm me the date when it hits bottom again so I know when to buy. Also pm me the date when it hits 10 million.
@_date: 2019-04-03 18:04:41
I got scammed last year. Long story short, tried to buy something, turns out it was a fraud/scam, I lost like 0.25 BTC. I learned my lesson lol
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:10:55
I'm just waiting for $69,420
@_date: 2018-11-05 10:01:26
Littering, and selling at the ATH.
@_date: 2018-11-02 15:17:48
I saw this posted a few months ago but it's still funny.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:56:27
Happy holidays, Reddit! I might buy a quarter of a Bitcoin if prices keep falling.
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:51:30
At this rate I might be able to afford a whole Bitcoin! Hell hopefully I can get 2
@_date: 2018-07-11 03:10:40
What an absolute truth this is
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:31:55
Never will always be a strong word.
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:21:42
Oh no I lost $3.50 ������
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:14:47
I've been waiting months to buy, and I just bought around 0.2 BTC as a Christmas present to myself. I love losing money for Christmas lol. Not as bad as last year though, ouch

@_date: 2018-12-25 22:31:30
Well I don't understand anything in this thread so... Merry Christmas?

Just for the sake of clarity, the right side is a mirror image of the left after the peak. Not the actual timeline but a funny post nonetheless
