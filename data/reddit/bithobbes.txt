It might be possible to use the market price at the time of coin creation. (Premine and fast emission changes should get a price of 0).

A tiny tail emission compensating lost coins would be very reasonable in the long run. Of course it's virtually impossible to introduce without a fork. In 300 years or so it might even become a must (just imagine someone finding an old hard drive with more coins on it than all remaining BTC). I wonder whether Satoshi was aware of this issue but did not solve it due to marketing.

@_date: 2017-12-05 21:06:26
Are you trying to say that no coins get lost? There is no practical disadvantage to a small tail emission. In the long term there would be a fixed number of coins in circulation (in contrast to Bitcoin's declining number).

Mining at a loss? Miners must be greedy (at least mid term). That's what I call a dishonest miner. Unless they make more money this way via shorts. But it seems the honey badger will shrug them off anyways.

This is a neat way to effectively split the data dir between hdd and ssd to save space on the ssd:   
  
Instead of using the script as the wiki suggests in the second case (datadir on ssd) it is much easier to simply create a second, nested symlink so that the index directory goes back to the ssd.

Maybe it’s best if there is the "right" level of privacy. So that privacy is the default for small amounts and everyday transfers but with agency style effort it is still possible to track a few larger transactions. I have a feeling people might not be ready for total privacy yet.  
  
Whatever your view on the "right" level of privacy might be, think about what level will rise in value the most. Probably something in between Bitcoin and Monero. Bitcoin (Lightning) with some privacy improvements should come close to the sweet spot.
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:09:32
Bitcoin is trustless.  
  
But it would be interesting to formalize trust and make a proof function of it (proof of trust, maybe send money to people and see if they send it back or something to make trust 'mineable').

@_date: 2019-10-01 18:34:55
"The most intriguing question, of course, is what the future will bring. What is certain is that Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio will increase drastically in May 2020 - i.e. after the next halving - from around 25.8 at the moment to almost 53. By contrast, gold’s stock-to-flow ratio (currently in the vicinity of 58) will only be insignificantly (if at all) higher next May. If the May 2020 stock-to-flow ratio for Bitcoin is factored into the model, a vertiginous price of around USD 90,000 emerges. This would imply that the forthcoming halving effect has hardly been priced into the current Bitcoin price of approximately USD 8,000 (the current model value is roughly USD 7,500)."

Back then the limit was relatively hard compared to the elasticity today. Transaction batching is more common and segwit and LN are available.
@_date: 2019-02-23 09:05:38
What about a tail emission of 0.4 BTC per block (~ 1% per year) to compensate for lost coins? This would stabilize supply at ~~10 Million BTC or so depending on the loss rate (~2% per year as per my guess). Without tail emission Bitcoin supply will become deflationary as of 2030 or so.
@_date: 2019-02-25 07:55:05

No idea about sd card performance but here is how you do it elegantly. Assuming the bitcoin core folder is on the ssd.  
  
Copy the blocks subfolder to the sd card. Copy the index subsubfolder back to the bitcoin datadir as blocks_index or something. Create one symlink (using ln on linux or mlink on windows) so that datadir/blocks is linked to the folder on the sdcard and a second, nested symlink so that sdcard/blocks/index is linked back to blocks_index.
  
The idea is to have only the block data on the sd card (usually a hdd) but the block index on an ssd.

This means they could sell their customers an ASICBOOST software upgrade, potentially destroying Bitfury (and Canaan). And with the boost they would be at &gt; 80% hashrate. :-/
@_date: 2017-04-06 11:26:59
Would it be possible for Bitmain to allow all their customers to activate ASICBOOST? Might this lead to a situation with more than 50% of miners using it?
@_date: 2017-04-07 07:06:07
Not quite futile. They would still have an advantage against the Non-Bitmain chips. I just hope Bitmain chips make up for less than 50% of the hashpower.
@_date: 2017-04-27 10:43:50
Exactly! Blocking SegWit for political reasons at this point just seems illogical. It will give us immediately more room to breath and we can take a fresh approach in a year or whenever necessary. Who knows what Bitcoin will look like by then. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:53:59
This is difficult for me to understand. Less operations per hash should lead to a higher hashrate...
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:19:27
You don't force anything but as u/kixunil says, anybody claiming he is not using covert AB can prove it easily with a patch. If a couple of miners would start doing it there would be social pressure for all the others to do the same.

No, there will be an equilibrium against lost coins. With Bitcoin in 500 years or so if someone would find a very large stash on an ancient drive it might double the circulating supply.

@_date: 2017-09-11 22:41:15
I am not quite sure I understand the application, so let me try to describe it in my own words: you need the web wallet (downloaded anew for every use) to connect to a local https server. The certificate of the local server must be known and valid to the browser/system certificate handling. So you have trezord.exe download the cert with every start so that you have the flexibility to react with cert changes that might become necessary because of some CA revoking your certificate.  
  
Why don't you simply hardcode the cert and have the webwallet ask the user to update the driver in the case of an invalid certificate?  
  
In case someone has trezord.exe up and running and the cert needs to be changed you need to ask him to restart anyway...

The incident happened in the afternoon of May 14 this year. The multi-millionaire in his 40s was at home in the apartment block in Oslo when it rang at the door.
When he opened, a man was standing outside with a shotgun in his hands. The robber made his way into the apartment and said, "Lie down, or I'll shoot," according to an indictment taken by Oslo Attorney General's Office.
The ranger did not bring any values ​​because the multimillionaire managed to escape.
He ran out onto the balcony and threw himself out from the second floor and ended up on the street. It is unknown whether he was injured during the escape.
- We do not want to comment on this matter, says Pål Sverre Hernæs, who is the assistant attorney for the multi-millionaire.
The victim has been working with cryptocurrency for nearly ten years. The accounts from the man's company show that he is good for more than NOK 100 million. The robbery victim is listed as general manager and owner of the board.
He has previously been in the public on the basis of the success he has achieved in making money on cryptocurrency.
The accused man is defended by lawyer Benedikte Johansen.
- My client does not admit criminal charges after the indictment, but beyond that I do not want to comment.
It is police lawyer Ellen Karine Aas who will bring the case to court on October 17 and 18. TV 2 has not succeeded in getting in touch with her.

**Lessons learned**  
(may seem obvious but I still wanted to let other meetups learn from our mistakes)
General  
* quite some people at a  public meeting don't understand or don't care about the issue  
* some people dislike the general idea of releasing a statement for a group of people  
* have a presentation to explain the situation and arguments (balanced!)  
* Keep the statement extremely short and close to the point  
* be prepared for and accept different opinions and odd reasoning  
* keep the statement marked as "draft" at all time  
  
Voting  
* explain the voting process up front  
* decide on a quorum before the vote (thanks * show the questions in written  
* there must be "abstention" as an option  
* have several people count votes  
* have a single person clearly ask for hand signs  
* avoid double negations  
  
**Some additional info**  
I talked to two of the people who voted against the statement in private later on. Here is how I understood their opinions:  
One is an ethereum guy who had formal reservations (statement should be split into several parts, fundamental reservations against general statements from groups).  
The other one wanted to scale as fast as possible and did not see any strong downsides.  
The third person I have never met before and could not get a hold of after the vote.

Also be careful about printer ghosting.  
  
A faint echo of the print might occur a bit further down the page. This might be completely invisible but still possible to reconstruct with some effort.  
  
In some situations this can be very bad, e.g. if you want to split a key/phrase and print out both halves. With ghosting both halves might accidently land on the same piece of paper! (could be a second page or a cut off part of the same page).

At first I thought Barry wanted to trick the miners. It was really odd that he did not try harder to make core more a part of it. Almost like a loophole.

You can only increase block size after fixing the quadratic block hashing/verification vulnerability. SegWit (or something very similar) is the proper sustainable fix.

Satoshi never imagined mining would get so centralized so quickly. Also if he would design Bitcoin anew from scratch today it would certainly look very similar to SegWit. Think of SegWit as a long needed fix for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:03:28
If this would really preserve covert ASICBoost then it would be the worst suggestion ever.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:22:57
I was refering to  and the "verfied chatlogs". Malleability is not the only thing SegWit fixes. What other sustainable options are there to fix malleability? My guess is they would look quite simiar to SW. I don't see any way we could come up with anything better than SWSF before it is too late and an altcoin takes over.  
Also: Please stay civil and stick to facts. I try to do so, too.

@_date: 2017-05-23 22:18:21
What about this trick:   
At this point as both sides agreed on SegWit things may only be about saving face. Maybe a counter offer with the hardfork one year later will convince them. So the hardfork could actually be useful.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:50:18
Without public mining usually there is also a low price. I would say it is as good or better as marketcap, at least a good addition.  
This measure would be relatively hard to game, wouldn't it? Mining a lot of coins at a high price is kind of self limiting.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:15:53
Yes. Easier upgrading. Better to do SegWit first because of vulnerability.  
details: 
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:15:45
There exists a vulnerability in Bitcoin that can make verifying blocks (signature hashing) take a long time. The time this can take increases quadratically with block size and 1Mb seems to be close to the limit. SegWit fixes this issue sustainably (for SegWit txs).  
Another thing: any hardfork would lead to a chain split in the current situation. We don't have time to wait it out either. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:40:06
Cynicism won't bring us forward. Also if you would design a new coin from scratch it would look like SWHF without a doubt. So core is not pushing for a technically perfect solution but (rephrasing) an overall reasonable solution.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:34:02
No because then we would have a chain split.

Don't mean to disagree but even with 2nd layer scaling we will probably still need bigger blocks at some point in the future. It's just that it's logical to do SegWit first as we need it anyway.

How is this 'shitposting against BU and **mocking** Ver and others'? IMHO OP is neutral.
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:49:04
What about an "eruption capitalization"? Sum of coins mined * price at time of mining. Premine has a price of 0. Or divided by the number of coins to give an "average eruption price".
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:20:28


Thanks for the correction. I still think SegWit is the cleanest solution to this problem but yes, there would be other ways.  
  
What about the risk of a chain split? That is much lower with the SF way. What about replay protection? I hear this is quite difficult to implement.  
  
Why not take the SegWit increase now with all its benefits* and discuss further block size increases later?  
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:02:22
Wow! The game is on!
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:24:20
Do I understand correctly that if you were to increase blocksize after SegWit you can only safely increase SegWit transactions capacity because of the SigHash issue?
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:01:15
That's horrible. The community would benefit if you would discuss these facts with Sergio on that old thread. I know there are other more urgent matters.
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:15:49
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:32:56
Well, about a factor of two more.   
With every settlment transaction beeing the base for hundreds of 2nd layer transactions people would pay way higher fees. But maybe miners don't see that.
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:26:47
Please educate yourself about that freakin' agreement some more. It is probably most abused and misunderstood piece of information in the whole Bitcoin world.  
  
  
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:52:01
I updated the OP to make myself more clear.  


Price on Gox was way higher than on Bitstamp because of fiat withdrawal issues. There may have been other issues (Willy) but this certainly played a role, too.  
  


That and because they are skewing the market. If they would only allow BTC outflow in the same amounts as they do fiat it might also help. And the reason I gave in the OP.
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:59:49
Because the agreement was completely unrealistic and unfinished. Here is a version that might work in this world: 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:50:08
That would be very smart. By how he shouted "I got xx% hashrate behind this and that" and did not even mention ASICBoost in the 'agreement' I had gotten the impression he had just started looking into the issue...  
edit: A fresh look might not be the worst thing to happen though.

Yup. Hopefully price appreciates way higher quickly and sheeple make a good buck :)
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:27:08
SegWit is a blocksize increase and the foundation for real scaling. It's also the foundation for further safe blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:32:41
But developers need to advise users on technical backround.
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:16:53
From a technical point of view it is superior to activate SegWit first.

So if the whole world would use Bitcoin for coffee you don't think that would raise the prise a bit? The price is rising *despite* the deadlock. With the perspective of SegWit and LN Bitcoiners would hodl way harder.

Could you please elaborate on what this legacy txs 2Mb hardfork does, how it differs from normal SegWit and how legacy txs and SegWit txs play together? I am only semi certain I got it right and I guess a lot of people missed the differences altogether.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:18:39


  
What gave you the impression that Core will never fork? Ever looked at their [roadmap](  
tl;dr: We will hardfork when it's necessary and safe.  
  
But not for political statements.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:17:41
Thanks for your post, food for thought. A counter argument: When Bitcoin was a tenth or a hundredth of todays value Jihan certainly made less profit then today. Also especially Bitmain should be in the best position to grow fast. If the price would rise he would probably be able to increase his rashrate share.  
If you are right or Jihan thinks the same way it would mean that users need to force him.
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:17:34
Sad but true. On the other hand side the users might remember the next time miners try to pull off some crap.
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:40:38
Sometimes I also get the feeling of a 'manufactured debate' but there is no proof, is there? Could also be miners short term financial interest.
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:25:46
Let's do SegWit now which we need anyways and then talk about further block size increases again in a year or so.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:26:46
Probabilty of SegWit being an increase is 100%. Because of my own transactions alone. Also as they will be cheaper people will switch quickly.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:29:05
There is provably (RBF) almost no miner currently running BU, just fake user agent, because it is too buggy. Maybe miners don't really want BU but just want to stall.  
But what you are saying is this: We want higher transaction capacity but the immediately available first step of the SegWit increase is not good enough. This is a political argument. Look at the Core roadmap text, it says further scaling when it is necessary and safe. Makes perfect sense to me.
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:32:25
It sure will when S2X brings it SegWit. About the hardfork... we will see later.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:55:34
And yet a hardfork now would certainly mean a chain split. Also SegWit capacity increase plus 2Mb at once does not make sense (particularly for the miners because of fees). So what about SegWit (=doubling today) + another doubling in five years?  
edit: But who is going to make this promise? And who will believe it?
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:35:27
We can still do a consensus hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:19:30
Sounds like an argument for UASF...
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:24:16
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:36:59
I hope thats's just like UASF to increase pressure but won't be really necessary. (If SegWit will not have activated until August I will go full kamikaze UASF though).
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:11:51

It will happen when it will become necessary and safe.

@_date: 2017-07-09 18:50:47
Blocksize increase: blocksize increase plus hardfork  
SegWit: urgent important stuff + blocksize increase without hardfork  
  
Logical choice seems obvious to me. Tell me why you are blocking!
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:20:13
I doubt it will be possible to 'force' this. It does not allow to make a quick buck so it might not have that much an influence. But innovation can take place 'in house' and there will be less justification to create altcoins I guess, so of course a cool thing.
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:47:18
By this logic we would have got SegWit a year ago. A year that we could have spent discussing in more productive ways.
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:54:50
No, a HF at the current circumstances would most certainly lead to a split.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:42:31
Only indirectly. Litecoin obviously does not need higher capacity with blocks being empty anyway. But it was an indicator how much interest in SegWit there is.
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:42:43
Great! We need more automatic dump buttons!
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:45:57
Ahh. Interesting, thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:37:57
Because Core wants a technically sound solution.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:18:58
You are saying they don't really want larger blocks? :)  Nah, I think they could earn way more with Bitcoin becoming the true global currency.
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:32:34
There is strong evidence supporting this conjecture:   If the "huge stash" of 1MM BTC does not belong to Satoshi then it belongs to some other single entity which would be worse IMHO. If you could disprove Sergio's analysis you would make me very happy.
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:23:11
Bitmain keeps stirring FUD to scare competitors away. Boo, another hardfork!
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:02:09
I still think he would make more by activating SegWit but that's the argument for UASF. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:45:50
Yes and I fed them...   But I guess core devs have to take so much of this crap that answering shows them our support. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:29:10
Nitpick: SegWit IS a block size increase by itself.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:36:42
As I wrote: There will be enough time to improve it to a first class HF. :)   It would be quite difficult to argue against such a combination without it looking like delay tactics.  
edit: 
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:13:55
This. Also another block size increase so fast would badly hurt the fee market.
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:42:45
This should be in the FAQ: Some significant miners broke the HK agreement about two weeks later. Hopefully SegWit2X or UASF will bring us SegWit finally so I don't have to deal with this any more.
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:59:23
Theory: People wisely want to move their funds off exchanges. For quite a lot it is much easier faster or safer or better (e.g. taxwise) to move BTC. So they convert the fiat they have sitting on exchanges driving up the price. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 09:10:44
I am not your baby sitter. Do your own research.
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:10:34
This is the best proposal for compromise I have heard yet.  
  
**Two years after SegWit activation if the average fee over the last 8,064 blocks is greater than 200 Satoshis per Byte double capacity* once.**  
  
  
Remaining issues:  
  
* *only witness transaction capacity can be increased because of the hash time vulnerability (?)  
* Replay protection  
  
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:40:48
When will a channel close?
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:45:45
Interesting that everybody calls the SegWit2x signaling 'BIP91' now. I am quite certain that was not the intention of SegWit2x.  
  
Probably in two months the majority of miners will not want a hardfork with a larger blocksize any more because fees will be too low already.
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:36:04
why are you repeating this here?
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:23:25

@_date: 2017-05-23 22:47:11
Combine your BIP with Lightsword's suggestion and bingo we have the compromise. Arguing against it should reveal any delay tactics and it might just be enough for everyone to save face. Everyone is waiting for exactly this as a counter offer to finally agree on.  
  
edit to clarify:  
* Lightsword bit 4 activation at 80%
* 2/4MB hardfork late 2018
* covert ASICBoost deactivated

Please combine this with a dirty 2MB hardfork implementation in a year. Maybe that could find a consensus and we can get SegWit activated ASAP. Then there will be enough time for the hardfork to be improved and it will actually be beneficial.
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:14:42
Incentivizing miners for UASF might really be a good idea.
