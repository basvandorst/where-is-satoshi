It's not reasonable to assume all regulators are evil. It is reasonable to question the ethics of creating a regulatory framework only to make immediate financial gains from its enforcement. There is an obvious profit motive here that undeniably shapes the construction of the regs in the first place.

Why do you doubt that such things will make it to the categories? Is it because you make the categories and probably won't include them, or is it that you think there will be no demand from merchants and customers?
Why do you say organs will likely be included (black market organs are usually obtained by violence, no?) but CP, snuf films etc. will not?

One example is Coinbase. They allow verifying a credit card to allow instant buying. They are a brokerage that debits your bank account, and they will float the bitcoin to you before receiving funds from your bank (can take 2-3+ days on the bank's end) if you've verified a credit card.
If you have a bank that doesn't penalize you too heavily, you can make a btc purchase that exceeds your bank account balance. When your bank account overdraws, Coinbase turns to your credit card for the remainder.
It's really not recommended for most people (I've never done it). But for those who are confident trading on margin, you would get better interest rates from most even high APY credit cards (20-30 APY). The going rate for USD loans on Bitifinex currently is .2274%/day or 83%/yr, and that can go much higher in more bullish markets.
All this said, people don't usually use credit cards to buy bitcoins. Exchanges don't accept them because of potential for chargebacks. So you are right in that assertion.

The limits are arbitrary to you but certainly not arbitrary to them. I guarantee you those numbers come from extensive calculations using private data.
They have to keep their ledgers balanced. If they are dispersing large amounts of bitcoin instantly, this means they are fronting a large amount of cash. It's obviously non-trivial, and as a customer you are exposed to that risk to a certain degree as well. If you have BTC in their wallet or a transaction that is pending you are exposing yourself to the risk of them becoming insolvent and not dispersing funds.
Now I don't know precisely to what extent your BTC funds in your Coinbase account are at the mercy of their solvency, but we've seen many exchanges/wallet providers tank and take their coins with them.
My point is that of course they are covering their asses. On the whole this is a good thing for you as a customer. If you want total freedom as a customer, you can do a private transaction and take the risk yourself or use localbitcoins. You're still trusting localbitcoin as they hold coin in escrow.

I do understand how much produce is thrown out. I've worked at a grocery store and intercepted a great deal of food before it made it to the trash. My wife and I now dig food out of the dumpster if it's still viable, with a cost savings of thousands of $ per year for us. We essentially live off the waste stream of that system you refer to. We aren't poor. We are homeowners. We are employed. But I digress..
My point I suppose is that I am being at least somewhat consistent here. I think the exploding volcano of firstworld wastefulness is atrocious and I never understood the mindset of "everyone does it so I might as well."
Let's extend out that logic a little.
Stuff gets wasted everyday ---&gt; Deliberately wasting for attention/protest is justified
People are murdered everyday ---&gt; Deliberately murdering for attention/protest is justified
Children are raped everyday ----&gt; Rape children to prove your point
Now I understand these examples are outlandish, but they are simply illustrating that you shouldn't justify action that is deemed shitty just because it's happening anyway. Ultimately it is just 5 phones. The world will continue spinning, the rivers will not dry up because of this one happenstance.
Really what this speaks to is our mindsets as privileged people who seem largely unaware of the scarcity that most people in the world live with. And this whole stunt does not endear ourselves to those people (those unbanked people that bitcoin hopes to serve someday), or to firstworlders who have sensibilities and can view the world from a different perspective.
Ultimately I'm not going to cry all day over this, I just think it's a shame. OP could have made the same point by having the phones donated.

As an aside, don't get hung up on the value of 1 BTC. It's really an arbitrary marker used to compare it's value against other things of value. $1000 would buy ~1.2 BTC or 100s of thousands DOGE, but both would spend the same. Well, that's not entirely true because BTC is much more widely accepted, but I digress...

Absolutely it is my place to judge. It's your place to judge. Everyone gets to judge. That's the basis for forming opinions.
You have a point that taking an unethical action can result in a greater good, and that it can be justified. However, I was questioning whether is is justified, and whether it would actually serve the greater good. I was not saying that people don't have a right to smash their phones.
What disgusts me is when people can't discuss issues without bringing their emotions into it, calling names like "bitch" and "hippie."

Out of curiosity Bruce, how many of them would you estimate made a large initial investment?
I only ask because the scenarios are quite different. Mining a few thousand coins when they were worth a penny then holding them through several bubbles until they are worth $1M+ takes quite a lot of wherewithal, especially for someone to whom that money is a life changing amount.
The other scenario is someone who has a large amount of capital to invest. Even though we aren't in "bubble" territory yet, there have been opportunities to nearly double your money in the past few months alone. For someone who can drop a million dollars into BTC, waiting a couple of months until it doubles seems to require somewhat less fortitude.
I don't really know what my point is here. In the end, we're all early adopters at this point, many of us looking for that profit.
Here's to hoping that several years from now they are still looking back at the insane BTC gains and asking the same question!

Yes, other exchanges have cheaper fees. However, they are not brokers like Coinbase, who uses ACH. They accept bank deposits and therefore carry less risk. They are also geared more toward day traders.
I will concede that it may make sense to slightly lower the fees since they are lowering their risk. However, they have been charging 1% as long as I can remember. If anything they may have been more justified charging a higher fee when they were carrying a higher risk (after the price run-up and before they made this announcement).
I don't know the intricacies of their internal affairs, and what it might cost to run the business. There is no major competitor in the US market that acts as a broker (that I'm aware of) so it makes sense that their fees will stay the same until they have incentive to change that.
Customers dropping away will be incentive, customers grumbling will not be.
Ninja edit- I don't think I was nitpicking, the concept I was explaining is really the whole point. It's not more expensive to move fiat into btc now. It costs the exact same amount. The cost of buying one btc as opposed to buying any other amount is only significant as a benchmark.

Aside from what everyone else has said, take a look back at your original post.




If we replace every number there with a percent, I feel you argument dissolves.
If the fee has always been 1%, then it has always costed $8.50 to buy $850 worth of bitcoin. So if the product you are buying cost $850, then back when 1btc = $20, you still would have had to purchase $850 worth of btc and pay $8.50 in fees to buy the same product.
Likewise, in regards to how much the price must change to break even, if I had bought $850 worth of btc back when it was $20, I would still have to see the value of btc rise 2% to see my investment returned.
Plug some numbers in for different btc values and it should all come out the same.

Since HSBC is a publicly traded company, is that actually the case? I thought public companies were required to divulge extensive documentation of budgeting, executive compensation included.
The point that I was trying to make is that HSBC, as a corporation, should be treated as a single entity, and as such how they budget the fine is really of no concern to the public when trying to illuminate the significance of the fine in relation to the company's budget as a whole.
So each department has a budget that they operate under, but ultimately the profit each department produces is counted toward the company as a whole's profit. Or if it literally goes into a department-specific fund, it can still be considered part of the company as whole's fund, since each department is just an arm or a leg of the company as a whole.
In your analogy, the boss makes you pay the fine out of your salary. In reality, this won't happen with a corporation. Think about it- everyone who handled more money (or materials, equipment, etc.) than they earned would be carrying a huge amount of risk just going to work! In reality, the employer takes on that risk and as such takes on the upside risk too- making a profit. As an employee, I can be fired from the company for mistakes I make but can't be held liable beyond that. The exception to this may be when an employee does something that is illegal under their own volition, breaking their contract. This may be the case for HSBC, but it seems unlikely they will pursue that because they would not want evidence to come to light that anyone in their company had knowingly committed wrongdoing.
Your point about the bonuses is salient, but it's important to note bonuses are not considered salary and are contingent upon positive performance, specifically performance that makes the company money. If HSBC actually netted a significant amount of money from this whole ordeal (ie. the money they made from laundering far exceeded the fine), then I would actually not be surprised if the department heads responsible still received bonuses!

These are all very good points, though some of them can apply to BTC to some degree.

I don't think your interpretation leaves room for civil discussions. Is it inevitable that one person in any disagreement will be an asshole? Does taking a firm stance if you are confident make you a jerk, or are you only a jerk if you turn out to be wrong? By that line of reasoning no one should ever take a firm position, instead preempting everything they say by "I think" or "This may be the case" etc, even if they are not uncertain.
If anything the person who displays confidence when they were wrong comes off as looking stupid, but not necessarily as an asshole. I personally don't think it is mean to disagree with someone, even with measured confidence, as long as you're not insulting or condescending when you do it. And I don't think simply asserting that someone is mistaken is condescending.

Hey, great service!
I have a premium account and have used it to compile my gains and the list of sales. What I haven't figured out is how to easily upload the list to turbotax.
I noticed one of the download options for the document "Sales of Capital Assets" was a "turbotax" file with the extension .txf. However, my computer can't read it and turbotax doesn't appear to allow uploading files from your computer. They only seem to do direct linkups with a certain brokerages/websites. The only option I can find is manual entry, which would obviously not be ideal for 100s of sales. Do they allow for attaching additional documents somewhere? What am I missing here??
I know this query is probably more for turbotax to deal with, but if you could point me in the right direction I'd be very grateful!

In your analogy, you say your boss makes you pay the fine. In reality, no individual from HSBC was liable for the fine. Further, I don't see any citation from you saying that the fine was taken from a single department's budget. To my understanding, the fine was levied against the company as a whole.
How they decided to internally deal with the lost funds seems largely irrelevant to me.
Since corporations are essentially treated as people, a better analogy would have been a single person has a fine levied against them that represents 5 weeks of their salary. Now you can also say that fine represents 6 months of grocery/restaurant budget, or 3 months of mortgage, or whatever. But that all depends on how that person spends their money, so it's really more telling to look at it from a perspective of how much the person is earning.

The production stream for iPhones involves low wage workers the whole way up the chain. Precious rare earth minerals are mined from the earth at great cost to the workers and the habitat. iPhones are assembled by low wage overworked humans.
All of these are good reasons not to buy an iPhone in the first place (their anti-btc stance could be counted among them), but they are also good reasons one shouldn't wantonly destroy them.

I think it's a great idea, and if y'all pull it off it would be a fantastic use-case for bitcoin. 
You would either have to integrate a wallet service into your app, or (probably much more simple) just have people submit an address where you forward the coin to. The downside of the latter is that you would attract fewer people who have never used bitcoin, and therefore don't already have a wallet.

This also answers well the argument that "no one will spend BTC because it is deflationary."
Well, first of all, people empirically spend BTC. They just do.
But I think what you describe is a great explanation of why. Folks whose initial BTC  investment was a manageable portion of their portfolio, but their BTC value has now grown to outsize their other (lower risk) investments, are often inclined to rebalance their portfolio.
Spending BTC on goods and services is one way to rebalance. This would be especially tenable if it freed up fiat revenue streams to direct into lower risk assets.

If we want to stick in the realm of sports, I'd say we should raise our ambitions and try to sponsor an entire event. Something like a bowl game in US college football, but ideally a more global event. That may be a bit too ambitious though.

Seriously, how long until people grow tired of that? It is human nature; soon it will be uncool to talk like a dogebot. A new fadcoin will come along and people will flock to it.
The bitcoin community should be glad for fadcoins as long as btc remain the central cryptocurrency that survives the tides of popularity.
The existence of fadcoins is fascinating and a new phenomenon in the world of currency/money/value. I don't think they should be discounted out of hand nor propped up to be more than they are.

I have wondered about whether they netted money from this. I'm not convinced they actually did make money off it, though haven't been able to find a source that addresses that directly. [This Bloomberg article]( has a few telling bits of info:




So what this tells us is that HSBC was not monitoring a huge amount of money moving from Mexico, $881 million of which the USFG claimed belonged to Mexican cartels.
What this doesn't tell us is how much HSBC profited from doing so. That $881M is not their profit, it's the amount of money they handled for the cartels. In reality, they would only be taking a fraction of that for profit.
That article goes into detail about other charges in the indictment, including the fact that HSBC had been doing business with countries who were sanctioned at the time (Iran, Libya, Sudan, Burma, and Cuba).
Anyway, I would be interested to hear if someone had an exact figure for their profit from dealing with the cartels and sanctioned governments.

While you are correct that phones have a relatively short life in the hands of users, I don't think that means we should waste perfectly good ones. Saying there are "absolutely no repercussions" is a little shortsighted, no? I mean compared to child rape, it is insignificant, but that was simply meant to illustrate an extension of your logic.
Really I think your best argument here is that broken phones can still be recycled, so the waste of the rare materials is somewhat minimized.
But there are repercussions, in that this will turn some people off to the bitcoin community, in that a phone that was usable is no longer, etc..

I like the idea of the multi-pronged agenda, though unless we raised significant money it would be difficult to execute each effectively.
If we could establish a basic and cohesive strategy then a diversity of people might be inclined to contribute funds. It could be a one-stop-shop for donations furthering bitcoin, maybe even where people could designate their funds to one of the three prongs you mention. This way they can contribute in the areas they think are important but not have to track down a dev themselves to give some random amount of BTC.
I do foresee it being difficult to come up with an agenda that a large contingent of us would be amenable to. It seems that we can't even agree on whether we should take action or not.

I don't think your point really holds here, because was not making value claims about whether the law being applied to the two parties in question is moral or justified.
I feel like the gist of his post was that the evidence behind both cases was drastically different. In HSBC's case, there was not evidence (that was publicly available, to my knowledge) that showed they had knowingly allowed cartels to launder money. In Charlie's case, there are supposedly emails that show he explicitly accepted money from illicit sources.
So all the subjectivity in the morality of the law is irrelevant here because we are talking about how the law is applied to different parties.

This post goes into details, with sources. Yes, some people are able to get their BTC out with no issue, some people are getting screwed. 
I have not seen analysis on whether the users affected are random, or whether those who are having no problems have older accounts or if there is some other factor there. 
As a side note, there have been some folks who have begun to have issues withdrawing JPY, which previously had been the one thing people would point to when Gox was criticized: they'd say "I'm in Japan and I've had no issue withdrawing yen." See this comment by So those of you just brushing these circumstances aside, ask yourself if these occurrences are indicative of a successful, solvent company. Ask yourself if you've ever heard of a company (short of a monopoly like comcast) having such shoddy customer support in the face of such damning problems, and ask yourself if that company survived. 
I for one am not rooting for Gox to fail, as that would be a more serious blow to bitcoin's reputation than many failures before it. I would love to see them pull their shit together and start addressing problems promptly and transparently.

Bitstamp has been fine for me. Did they ever give you a reason for locking your account? Maybe it was being compromised without your knowledge?
The identity theft package is required by law in many places. As I understand it, you would need the same credentials to deal with any money exchanging business in said countries.

You're right, since the "5 weeks" for HSBC is profit, and not income, a better analogy would have been "5 weeks worth of profit for the individual" ie. his income minus essential living expenses ie. the positive change in his net worth over 5 weeks.

Folks here seem very focused on how TBI comes off, his writing style, etc. but there is very little discussion of what he is actually claiming. Sure, he probably should just release pertinent information. Yes, he is playing up the drama, and playing up his own importance. But honestly he has broken important news in the past.
If his claims are true then there have been serious, egregious violations of the public trust and probably the law. I find his second point to be particularly damning. If members of the bitcoin foundation were indeed given privilege in the queue to flee the sinking Gox ship, then I guarantee you most of those kicking dirt at TBI will be eating crow and drumming up the pitchforks come Monday.

Easy. Just add up the order books on all the exchanges up to $1000 per BTC. 
His point though is that would tell you practically nothing. Order books change rapidly, especially during high volume. If the price started skyrocketing people will move their orders up because they believe they can get a better sell price. Also, many orders are placed off the books on third party platforms and execute as market orders when the price hits the trigger. So you can never know all the limit orders by just looking at an exchange's order books. 
I suppose if you had an incredibly rich data set you could correlate past price movements with how orders moved in response, then apply that to a change in price levels in the future. I doubt it would tell you much though.
In terms of probability, market sentiment is not that predictable and is much more important than a snapshot of an order book when looking at a far-off price point.

What function does a "lead developer" or "lead scientist" serve in an open source project? Presumably they provide guidance and direction, but don't have more control than any other person. Presumably anyone could tweak the code, creating a hard fork, and try to encourage people to join them. Realistically though, not many people would actually join some random person's hard fork.
Which is why what may have been demanding was accountability from the community. In twenty years, bitcoin will still be an open source project. When faced with real and acknowledged problems, will we still answer with "it's a risky experiment, but I have faith?"
We all understand that there is risk involved, I guess a lot folks may have just been hoping to hear more specific encouragements from an "official" press release such as this.

Post announcement- no attention. Stir the pot- all the attention! Sadly effective indeed.
The best thing to do if you think someone is trolling, if you are to do anything at all, is to disagree with them on the merits, downvote, and potentially call out ad hominems and the like.
The best way to play directly into "the trolls'" hands is to start calling everyone who appears to care a concern troll and everyone who disagrees a shill.
This whole thread is a great example of the latter.

This is a great answer, thank you. I will note that one tactic of shills and trolls is to sow doubt and mistrust in organizations or forums, and I see the fruits of their labors here constantly. 
When faced by a post as you describe, I think a better option than labeling someone as a troll is to respond on the merits, downvote, and point out how this is well established. A look at their post history can indicate how harsh you can be in response, but except in the most obvious of cases I think it is counter productive to label someone troll.

"This type of trolling"
What type of trolling though? I'm sorry I just really don't understand. I'm worried even that I may be concern trolling? I've seen it referenced before, and I did a very light googling that involved looking at urban dictionary, but everything I read was really vague and conflicting. From the context I've seen it used in, it seems to refer to feigning concern to acheive a desired end (example- GOP or Dems opposing filibustering when they are subjected to it because it goes against the spirit of governing, which they clearly care about).

If coins pass 1K, 10K+, your lawyer may be convinced by the huge financial incentive to steal your coins.

I don't think the private keys are ever displayed on the screen. I think the public address is all you see on the screen. 
The private keys are printed face up in the bottom right of the machine. People are concerned that this is still too visible, as in some of the videos circulating you can clearly see it as it's dispensed. 
Some ways to deal with that would be to print it out face down onto a tray, or to print face up with an opaque hood that covers the dispenser.

The exchange holds all their bitcoin in one wallet. When you deposit bitcoin, they put it in that wallet. Whenever you submit a withdrawal request, they send your portion of bitcoins to an address of your choosing. Any transactions you make between deposit and withdrawal are kept track of on the exchange's private ledger.
If you deposit USD on the exchange and then buy bitcoin, the bitcoin stays in the exchange's wallet until you request a withdrawal.
They do this to avoid spamming the blockchain with daytrading transactions.

It's hard to tell how much btc an average holder controls because many people may use numerous addresses. [We do know that the average address has less than 1 btc](
I would wager the average btc holder has substantially less than 10 btc.
If you are holding a ton of coins, most likely you are an early adopter, you are an already wealthy/mature investor with diverse holdings, or you are newer investor with a less diverse portfolio.

This bot is trying to spread fear/awareness of what the btc economy/culture will look like with coinvalidation.

The price of one bitcoin does have meaning. It is a standard unit.
For gold and silver, the standard is one ounce or one gram. For USD, the standard is 1USD (not one dime or one $5 note). For oil the standard is one barrel.
Observe that all of these units are divisible to at least some degree, just like bitcoin. It would be silly to compare 1/3 a barrel of oil to 3/4 ounce of gold. Likewise it would have been silly for OP to say 500 millibits is 4.5 times the value of 1 ounce of silver.
Instead, you always set both commodities to their standard units (so in this case 1 bitcoin and 1 ounce of gold), and let their ratio tell you the information you need.

$100 = 0.1 btc
$10 = 0.01 btc
$1 = 0.001 btc

Thanks man! First tip right here.

This is my understanding:
When you buy a bitcoin from Coinbase, essentially they are fronting you the money by buying your bitcoin right then. When the transaction clears your bank, they release the coin to you. When there are high volumes and especially when the price rises quickly, there can be problems with liquidity (ie, they don't have enough cash on hand to float people's coins).

Would that even be that bad for you?

This may be obvious, but send a small amount first so you're sure it's all correct.

Their fee is not low. I think they charge 1%, whereas Bitstamp starts at .55% and goes down from there based on your monthly volume.
Coinbase is useful for small volume trades because it's connected to your bank account and you don't have to worry about moving your money to an exchange. If you verify and add a "backup" credit card, you can buy instantly.
