That's a lot of fees for something that has been advertised as feeless for years. 
I'll use my cc instead. Thank you. 
Seriously? I'm getting downvoted to hell for pointing this out?
@_date: 2015-07-15 12:00:06
No, far from. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 06:08:05
You and this thread are getting downvoted. 
Panties are getting in a bunch. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:57:32
Well, that's some solid logic right there. All in!
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:34:13
The word is not out there. Get out of fantasy land. Just like last month 99.9% of the Greeks have never heard about Bitcoin nor care for Bitcoin. 
There is one place where Bitcoin + Greece was happening and it was in this sub. And certainly not in Greece.

Why don't you point out how he is lying and why he is an amateur. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 06:02:09
You're reaching. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:01:48
Surprising. 
And downvoted. Because obviously i am wrong and this wasn't suprising. In reality everyone expected them to all raise their hands. Right guys?
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:39:33
No. 
Greeks aren't buying bitcoins. What will it take for this sub to understand this?
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:53:50
I'll get a tampon from my purse to wipe my tears.

Neither are the users of 100's of other currencies. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:35:17
Ah experts. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 07:40:14
Come on. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:23:56
No thanks. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:07:41
I have no idea how Trezor works. Does this affect Trezor users?
@_date: 2015-07-15 06:01:18
That's odd. My bank cards take 1 second. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:05:14
You can't believe that because you don't understand traders and how they work. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:18:34
I'm fine with reporting spam obviously. But i think we can all agree that this sub wouldn't mind abusing that system on people who say stuff they don't like. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:19:33
You are completely delusional if you think 5% of the Greek population is considering Bitcoin. Not even close to 5% knows what it is. 
The people actually buying or considering buying is probably in the 100's or low 1000's. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:04:11
I'm sure everyone here realized this would just be a pump and dump. Nobody is dumb enough to fall for this 50 times in a row. 
Downvoted because??
@_date: 2015-07-15 05:55:30
Still today the dark nets are a huge part of the daily Bitcoin transactions. 
Nothing wrong with that. Hell, this place is filled with dark net buyers. Yet for some reason when you mention it then everyone gets their panties in a bunch. Like everybody knows it but you're not allowed to mention it. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:51:11
I'm sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:28:14
Do you realize what the downvote system is for? Downvoting someone because you don't like his username is not it. And neither is downvoting someone because you don't like his tone. And the only reason you don't like my tone is because i question your facts and you're clearly too full of yourself to accept such a thing. 
It you come to a public forum and start discussions you should man up and not downvote everyone you disagree with. It makes you look extremely childish if you can't even handle some words on the internet without trying to censor that person. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:31:36
It was neither Greece or China. But as always mainly traders jumping on the events and expectations. The pump started with that and the dump happened when Greece made a deal this morning because traders realized this was obviously the end if the pumping. 
It's like this every single time. I have no idea why i am explaining this again. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:47:29
Bitcoin is unusable to the average Joe. Let's work on that first and then let's talk about saving a country. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 11:57:08
Yes? What does that have to do with my lost?
Did you downvote me?
@_date: 2015-07-15 05:59:21
If you are implying that governments are buying or investing in Bitcoin then i have some bad news for you. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:11:27
I've indeed seen posts dissapear that we're perfectly fine. I mean in a normal world where dicussions and criticism are allowed. 
If this is the case that would be crazy. It's already crazy how people report posts here they don't agree with. 
What kind of person would do such a thing?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:17:06
Give me a break. I see this answer everytime the hivemind turns out to be wrong about something. 
Always that guy who can't wait to explain how "this sub has many different voices". 
Don't be a hypocrite. You know damn well what i'm talking about. 
And you also know damn well why i'm getting downvoted. For pointing out uncomfortable facts. For talking about things we don't talk about here. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:49:20
Funny. It's always the same here. This sub highly recommends a certain service and then when that service goes to shit the same people will tell you you are stupid for using that service. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:59:38
Free market. 
Ok, i'm getting downvoted to hell. So what now? This sub suddenly doesn't like the free market anymore? Serious question. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:49:06
Why are you showing your name everywhere?
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:05:50
Are you telling me that if enough people report a post they don't like it will get auto removed?
In this sub? So basically anything that doesn't add to the pump?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:42:08
Yes, keep playing your silly little game. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 11:59:54
Because they buy and sell. Why would that make the price skyrocket exactly?
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:08:56
How cute how you right away downvoted me for asking a totally normal question. 
You are free to just randomly claim things and anyone who questions your "facts" must be silenced. Correct?
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:25:55
You're talking to one of this sub's biggest psychos. Don't expect anything rational from him. He lives in a different reality. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:36:45
Sure. But then Bitcoin obviously as well. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 11:57:37
Amazing how you know what will happen with Bitcoin the coming months. Why don't you tell us how you know this?
