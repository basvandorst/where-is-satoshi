That's an old amount. That would be about $37 USD.
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:58:55
We've always wondered why they wouldn't, especially at a $70+ usd conversion. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:58:07
Stop opening these threads then.
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:23:21
I would never talk politics with a customer, but meetup wise, nope. I couldn't ever be around someone if they were spewing hate like that. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:43:19
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:56:53
Down again
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:43:43
Where? My place is only about 2000 sq feet. My bedroom about about 20X22 including the attached bathroom. 
The smallest place I've ever lived was a one bedroom apartment and that was about 650 sq feet. And it felt tiny. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:20:07
Drinking and running! 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:35:28
I deposited through BofA and the funds were there before I got home. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:59:40
Seriously? A $100 per coin premium is acceptable for you?

Sorry you lost your coins. :( That sucks so bad. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:19:36
8+ minute lag in the first 15 minutes of trading. LOL
@_date: 2013-03-27 04:17:23
The light... it burns! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:20:22
and back down to $805
10 minutes later - $688
15 minutes later - $580
more than $100 in 5 minutes. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:28:50
Yep. I cant imagine the regular miners have much time left. 
@_date: 2013-03-14 00:41:28
18 seconds? By themselves? Am I reading that right?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:17:59
It's open, except for the 9 minute lag... lmao
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:26:22
I used bitfloor and loved it. The fee wasn't TOOOO bad and getting the money into the account and ready to buy BTC within 15 minutes instead of days I lost less money buying as the price went up. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:28:04
I know lots of local redditors here from Phx. We actually have a very active group that overlaps with hashing. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:21:48
495 square feet. That's like the size of my bedroom. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:02:50
Ha, Try -75
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:12:09
Isn't it more the time between when a market order is placed and when it's executed?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:56:22
Where are you even seeing that info?
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:36:52
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:48:10
What's in NYC? 
@_date: 2013-03-31 03:51:37
Waiting to hear exactly how much it costs. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:14:06
I was one of those people! I sold at $61.50... I bought back in a bit higher, but I bought more today at about $84. Plenty good. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:18:29
I'm a student nurse, so in 1.5 years I'll have a valuable skill for a micro-nation. I'd be in. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:05:13
495 square feet is average? Seriously? I feel extremely sheltered. 
I always wondered why Ikea has those displays and then put the square footage there... like see, look what we can crap into a tiny space. 
Also, the last place I lived was a 2 bedroom apartment that was almost 1200 square feet. Apartments are for UN-princesses... so neener. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:27:35
Do you not see the GIANT green box that says they're behind?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:07:23
Because they're down?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:00:50
bitfloor is out too

I live in Scottsdale, AZ. My house payment is around $1100 a month. 
My friend rents a huge house about 20 miles outside of the southern end of the Phoenix valley separated by open desert. The house has 5 bedrooms and is 4000 sq feet. He pays $1600 per month. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:06:54
Oh god, I just looked up "bitcoin meetups phoenix" and saw some people at meetup.com and their interests are nothing like mine! One guys says "Glen Beck tells it like it is". I would want to punch that guy in the throat. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:30:57
It does feel weird, like some secret under ground deal or something. But it works and its fast. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:04:11
What if you buy $1000 and then sell for $1300 and then a week later the value would have been $1500? Or $1100? No one has a crystal ball. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:18:00
Caught in a land slide?
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:35:40
Ditto. I want it soooo bad! 
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:03:25
Where did you buy your crystal ball? I really want one!
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:37:08
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:08:01
Except its way back down again
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:53:29
But for every buyer there has to be a seller, too. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:51:00
Seller lists email address to circumvent ebay... listing reported. What a fucking scam. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:41:02
I would jump on this if I could immediately get bit coins from a credit card purchase. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:21:30
I bet you're a ton of fun at parties. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:31:58
I really, really am. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:52:13
I wish I had had some fiat ready to go. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:12:02
That would be awesome! I don't have much time left in my schedule, but maybe a couple here and there. I just wanna add to the list of businesses that accept them!

Happy Cake Day! I miss mine every year!

Except is is. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:05:47
A) Not a dude
B) No, not at all. That's not that big of a bedroom. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:46:40
The lag isn't with logging in, its with making an actual buy or sell. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:55:56
How? If each BTC is worth $1 USD, there would only be $11,000,000 floating in the market. That's not much value to operate a currency.
