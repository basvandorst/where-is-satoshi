I am not denying history at all. The United States since its inception has been guilty of many crimes, but Russia has been guilty of many more. And like I said you can't compare Putin and Obama together. 2 more years Obama is gone, maybe in another 15 years Putin will.
I just never make false equivalencies. Imo no one is innocent, I just look who is worse. Just remember who is responsible for South Korea, and who is for North Korea.
I will never deny the wrongs of the US though cause there is plenty to complain about, but you will never convince any outside of Russia (and the US) that Russia is somehow more free then the US.
@_date: 2014-05-06 15:03:40
Nothing was sparked by the US. Stop being a conspiracy nut. It was sparked by a president that was corrupt as hell, and treated Ukraine as his own personal bank account.
Just look at his home. Sorry I am pretty sure RT didn't cover. And no, do not equate US leaders to Putin. In 2 years Obama will be gone, Putin will never until he dies. 
*and why do you put conflict in quotes? I never said conflict. There is a full scale land invasion though, and a civil war in the making. Don't try to put words in my mouth. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:07:04


That is a fair point. I just know I am so sick of these millionaires that get away with tax evasion, while I have to pay taxes. We need to get draconian with them.

@_date: 2014-05-12 12:58:35


Yes cause people in the East have governments that never manipulate their currency, like China and Russia. Maybe you should move and live in the East for their superiority in their monetary system that is never manipulated. *Ahem sarcasm*
You always have some anti-western sentiments, I really do wonder why you don't move to the East.
@_date: 2014-05-08 16:44:41
I know you never stated that, I was making a point, that is in a nutshell Russia is far more authoritarian then the US and that is why Russians come here to live and work and rarely the reverse happens. So to clarify I know you didn't say that nor did I attempt to try to make it seem that way in the slightest.
I also find it very ironic/odd/telling that you didn't answer any of my questions... ergo I win! Remember too, I am not saying the US is the best country in all aspects, but compared to Russia it most certainly is. Now answer my questions from before!
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:47:21


Here is a link of someone that happened too. Apparently he is beating the case
Certainly it is not worth it, but on the other hand how is tor supposed to work? It is a conundrum.

Not very good.

Well we can't deny there would be certain pitfalls in getting paid in BTC, I guess it would depend on the person and the market.
@_date: 2014-05-06 02:44:30
New to BTC and Reddit? You got a lot to learn.
@_date: 2014-05-06 14:30:03
Hope people know this article has nothing to do with bitcoin, not even in the slightest. I doubt OP has any idea what is going on in Ukraine.
We have an extremely hostile regime, ruled by a dictator for 14 years plus it is straight up annexing land to create the Soviet Union 2.0.
Now our government (which is not the best, but certainly a thousand times freer then Russia), has 2 options to try to stop them. A) Militarily. That is All Out War, or B) Economic Warfare. 
Sorry you are wrong here, and indeed living in your btc bubble. Try checking out occasionally.
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:48:15
Hell I would be surprised if people didn't already know about this. That must have came out more then 5 years ago, if not more.
@_date: 2014-05-08 11:37:32
Explain what my false equivalencies? And tell me what country do you live in?
As to age late twenties, if you really must know. Now answer my questions. Cause I bet there is no little New York in Russia. I've known many Russian and other eastern Europeans in America. Are you in Russia? Can you tell me the same, honestly?
Hell I know there are statistics on Russian living abroad.
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:59:08
I would say it is good. I wouldn't be surprised if most people of don't even vote, at least now they can contribute to the process with donations.

Thanks I will check out the link. I would like to see if there is anything like BTC bargains of the day or something like that.
Because if something costs a lot more when buying via BTC I can't justify it.
@_date: 2014-10-03 15:34:33
I was thinking if anything his friend would have put him on. I mean why else would he be asking for *his* help, nahmysaying? 
I wonder what type of help his friend is giving him anyway. These things much of the time are due to social engineering, at least I think so. What better way to social engineer by already know the person. *Or* if this person had access to his computer he could have easily installed malware without notice. Just my 2 cents. 
Op really didn't give shit for info.
@_date: 2014-05-12 13:05:29
For real. The article has nothing to do with BTC, and just talks about deadbeat millionaires that avoid paying taxes. r/bitcoin has *some* elements of anti-government, tinfoil hat, and conspiracy in it.
The fact is we need taxes in a society. I mean that is why we are a civilization. If no one pays taxes, well lets see what happens.
Taxes even helped fund the development of the internet.
@_date: 2014-06-21 22:46:49


I just noticed this for the first time the other day, but to be fair with a 7% sales tax it is about $454 :/ just sayin.
Does overstock charge for shipping? I am not trying to put you down or anything, but I do feel like Abcdguy does make a fair point (while being a dick too). I have Amazon Prime for 6 months free because of my .edu email and it is fucking sweet.
It is only a couple bucks so no big deal, unless they charge shipping a crazy amount.
*I see you got free shipping so not bad, and that would make it comparable it Amazon.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:09:34
Yeah somehow I don't see Pakistan changing anything. I am going to try to look up this law. I wouldn't be surprised if it is rooted in some bullshit religion garbage.
*Well according to the link OP put up it is about anti-terrorism. Well I guess I was sorta right.
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:06:43
I suggest you give another gift too. At least an action figure or something to cover your bases.

@_date: 2014-05-07 17:21:49
Ok you win. Russia is so great that in fact I bet Americans will begin to immigrate there in huge numbers. Just how millions of Russians have already immigrated to the US, oh wait...
All I can say is I hope you live in Russia, cause if not I suggest you move there. 
Also 
And stop making false equivalencies. Russia outright bans people for the way they are born. It makes being gay a criminal offense.


Yep and Russia doesn't do this. Please. Not saying it makes it right, but don't act like Russia doesn't do this. 
I would bet every penny to my name that at least a million Russians would jump at the chance to move to America. Doubt you can find 100 Americans that would move to Russia. In fact I doubt anyone would move to Russia in the Western world.
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:22:49
No, again you are making false equivalencies. In Russia they jail you for being gay. That says a lot about your rule of law.
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:44:25
I get that, but I know you can see why people thought your comment came off as being a douche. Whatever the case I do agree with you to an extant.
I think people sometimes to try to hard too propagate Bitcoin sometimrd, when it should be able to stand on its own two feet (it does). Even though bitcoins is not a business, I like to think of it in terms of one in *some* cases. The case being that using BTC should be done (over cash/debit/credit) because it is ideal, whether you are talking about saving $, expediency in payment, staying anon, etc.
But it should never be done just for the hell of it, and at some loss. Apparently in this case all things were equal (almost) so choosing to use BTC is very understandable. I may have done this myself as well.
*Another thing too is that you assume that OP has Amazon Prime (lets excuse the 30 day trail). I actually have 6 months free of Prime, so to me all things would not be equal in this case scenario. He got his in 5 days, I would get it in two. But if Overstock had a similar shipping deal I would certainly use BTC as payment.
@_date: 2014-10-03 13:46:23
Not OP but are you suggesting that his friend stole the coins? Could be possible if  if he is more knowledgeable with computers in general. He could have gave him access to computer beforehand. Speculation, but always a possibility.
@_date: 2014-05-06 15:11:25


This is not a new concept. Every government has used economic warfare at point or another.


I guarantee you I can go on and almost pick any article at random and some how relate it to btc in some imaginative way. I'm sorry I just believe you are grasping. What you basically saying any news about banks is btc news.
I get where you are going, and what is on your mind but still is grasping.
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:46:56
Definitely better then his music.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:48:12


Those are certainly a problem, but Pakistan's greatest problem is religion fundamentalism. I know I may be an outside observer, but it is completely obvious that religion is the root of your country's problem.
I realize poverty and other factors come in as well, but you stop fundamentalism (and eventually religion), everything will get better. No easy task of course.
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:43:21
I was gonna say this too. I mean this kid would want to be an activist to go through with something like that.
Also they maybe wouldn't even take the case. I remember not too long ago there was a case about a child that wasn't allowed to pray before eating lunch. I am pretty sure the parents sued, but they found out it was all bullshit. This kid could be either lying or leaving out certain details. I would bet on the latter.
@_date: 2014-05-12 13:09:43


Well give me a "tax dispute" then. It is shit like this that will make BTC targeted. People that do this will just add more scrutiny. We should all pay our taxes as a law abiding citizens. If you don't like it VOTE, and get out there to campaign for a politician that supports your view.

@_date: 2014-05-12 12:53:57
So the government is the bad guy (in this case I am sarcastic), because of deadbeats that don't pay taxes?
I don't see the outrage. Governments need to collect revenue in order for out societies and civilizations to thrive.
Also I see no direct relation to BTC.
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:13:03


Once, but only to prove my identity. Apparently someone had tried to use it. Got my refund 3 months late.
All I am saying the government needs some kind of power from people that avoid paying their taxes. I am not saying this is the answer, but there has to be a solution. If not we all get higher taxes. That isn't fair.
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:42:02

Unfortunately this may one of the only ways to fight the obscene amounts of money in politics. I just  hope all parties follow suit, especially because I care very little for the Libertarian party.

Also there is always the possibility of "GIGO". He could have simply misspelled the vendors name the first time. And what you said would make sense too.
Then again I definitely wouldn't doubt him either. The fact is no clearnet marketplace can stop scamming 100%, much less a darknet market. It is basically use at your own risk.
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:05:26
I think if you really don't pay any taxes you are a pos. Unless you live in some cabin by yourself like Ted Kzenski. But if you use roads, or any thing the government built then you are a scumbag.

As I have expressed many times in the past, I think the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto does not matter. 
He said that. He basically is saying that he is not interested in the identy of SN. Which is bull. I would say an extreme vast majority of us do want to know.
What I don't get is why he didn't defend himself if I was so out of context. He just let the massive zombie fanboi Followers talk for him. Ive lost the respect of many here. I get downvoted for simply disagreeing with 1 person and the cock munching brigade comes out (of the closet) It makes me think whoever wrote the script to downvote people possibly had some merit.
Listen all I did was call BS on someones OPINION, just as my comment was an OPINION. Do not get your panties in a bunch.
@_date: 2016-05-07 23:49:37
didnt read child. you are clearly a young boy with little experiences in life. you probably havent even fucked yet judging by your crazy ramblings. get laid.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:49:31
But I'm sure anyone that just takes the smallest research to realize that it doesn't depend on anyone, surely people that use Bitcoin already know this. That is the purpose of using BTC, the decentralization. It isn't like he could claim some ownership. At best he could influence some small aspects like others already do. Sorry I don't see how his identity being released would make an Authority driven market. Still need to call it out as an absurd statement that I feel everyone is agreeing with because in fact OP has authority on many here. Doesn't that make sense
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:57:59
he is saying that it it would create some confusion and people would think he has some type of control and authority over Bitcoin. Yeah to be honest I don't understand because it makes no sense. Not trying to ruffle feathers just being honest
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:24:58
I don't understand how Satoshi =Authority. That just sounds like some ridiculous idea thought up in 3 seconds. All satoshi did was  to make a known idea work. Furthermore Satoshi has proved not to want to be a public authority figure by being a ghost. He even could have continued with his pseudonym if he liked.
 So if you help me understand in a simple and fast answer(unlike Wright's blog) please do. Because to me that thought process is nonsense.
@_date: 2016-05-07 22:37:24


I guess you are weak. I personally do my best not to follow someone because of peer pressure and it is fashionanle.
As for you thinking it will go "mainstream" I am not convinced of that (Shreaks are heard OH the humanity)
If the Joe Blows do want to be followers and fuck up their investments or usage, then let them.  Surely the people that know better will likely make on them. Someones loss is usually the gain of another.

I'm positive that you have many fans but I have to disagree about knowing the creator would make some authority or whatever you are trying to explain. I really don't understand how you reach such a conclusion. Obviously some complex you have.
I'm not trying to insult just giving honest opinion. Otherwise I agree on not signing some stupid non disclosure agreement. That was a good call because I am sure most people would.

Who Andreas?
Whatever the case I would say he has A LOT of fanbois in here. I simply politely disagreed and I get downvoted like crazy. I mean seriously how can he or anyone say Satashi N is of no importance.
I would love to know who the person is, and not because I am some weird fanboi but cause it is human nature to want to know.
Odd thing is all these people that "agreed" with him and meanwhile went crazy trying to analyze all sorts of things in a search or to counter SN is not Wright or this person or that person.
Everyone that disagreed with me is basically a huge hypocrite liar and obsessed with Andreas analysis while they dont really agree. Crazy world. It reminds me of Drumf supporters
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:41:41

Stop trying to use words you dont understand to try to look smart when you are mediocre. 
Seriously is half of r/bitcoin insane and just pull whatever out of his ass? Their is plenty of STRONG circumstantial evidence he was trying to gain financially, do I really need to get the various posts and put them here?

I know what he said. It is all of you that contorted his words in the most insane ways to fit your perception. 
A lot of people will listen to what... Andreas says actually. (As if he was SN or GOD)
Btw what would it matter if the logical and sensible people did **listen** to SN? Not follow like you all do with Andreas and several other people, just listen on his opinion. I am not talking about fanbois like the ones that twist another words just to defend him. It reminds me when Drumf supporters on Cable News say "BUt but but He *really* meant this!! hehe, he is not a racist! wink wink wink".
We all should listen to each others opinions and then formulate our own when it cant be based on facts. Sorry that I am not ready to get on my knees for Andreas. I didnt realize how lots of you will defend him with craziness.

Oh sorry I wasn't accusing you at all. Didn't even construe it that way. I am talking in general. Thought you made a good point, cause gov fiat, means profits for private banks.
Yes you make perfect sense. When it comes down to it I suppose we will need to wait and see how BTC works in years to come in society, assuming it begins to be widely accepting. There really are a wide potential for different outcomes. Time will tell.

I just read that for coinbase to be instant you need to wait 30 days for new members.
I am in the USA, I will look into this camp bx thing. I am just looking for the fastest, and smoothest way to get coins. Since bitinstant was so dam easy and had no register, it kind left me spoiled and lazy.

I know it is not always so black and white, but it would be certainly odd to be calling yourself a Liberal and believe in a regressive tax system.

Appreciate the support. About go to bed now, but tomorrow...
@_date: 2013-07-14 23:04:22
Duly noted, thanks alot.
@_date: 2013-07-14 15:05:46
I feel you, but you have to understand as much as I love the idea of BTC, I am just a regular guy that is looking to get BTC and spend it asap. I leave the valuation and volatility to you aficionados.
@_date: 2013-08-25 12:13:38
Man this deserves a slowpoke meme.
Just use LocalBitcoins and use a cash deposit to their bank account. You can have your BTC within a couple of minutes after deposit of cash.
And Bitinstant is down cause they seriously fucked the pooch. They claim they are coming back, but that has yet to be seen...
@_date: 2013-07-17 06:55:26
Someone is going to get flogged for this.
@_date: 2013-07-11 15:38:47
That sounds cool. See i have used Bitinstant several times without fail. So I guess I may give them shot as they have never failed me. If they do then I am gone from their business forever.
@_date: 2013-07-17 06:32:07
You make extremely good points. But as a liberal you must believe in a progressive tax system, and an effective (but limited) Federal government.
See, bitcoin is great to me for the points you have layed out, but on the other hand I do believe there is potential for too much abuse to circumvent taxes that the we need as a country for investments (clean energy, infrastructure,research, etc). Do you ever think about that your self?
I know the Libertarian view on this, business invests not government. I can even respect, even I disagree.
I guess I am a little conflicted.
@_date: 2013-07-20 14:07:10
Well written. I agree with some of your points and not so with others.
Let me just add one thing that I believe should be mentioned, about bitcoin adoption.
This subreddit has a clear purpose of spreading the word of BTC, which is ok I suppose. The problem I feel is that many (note many) of the great innovations in human history shouldn't have a need for a cheer team.
The only reason it doesn't bother too much is cause bitcoin is not a corporation.
If this makes no sense I can explain my thought processes further.
@_date: 2013-08-10 20:22:58
Yea I really should use Coinbase, but I guess I am lazy and don't feel like jumping through all the hoops.
But you know what, I will put the effort in to look into it this week.
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:18:19
I guess I forget that it does go through Mt.Gox. I won't need to use them today anyway so  hopefully they have sorted it out soon. 
Please make sure you update. I need details! 
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:18:19
Appreciate the help I couldn't find any guide on line, but you gave me what I needed to know.
@_date: 2013-08-11 01:09:08
You know that had not occurred to me. I think your preparations are very wise and practical.
I am assuming that when Bitinstant went down the opposite happened. Personally I like using LocalBitcoins cause it can be crazy fast, but all things are not likely to be equal, i.e. Price.
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:41:20
Like you said Liberal, can have many meanings by different people. That is why I try to call myself a Progressive but in the end that has no definitive definition.
That is why I would not even use the words Democrats or Republicans. I mean shit that just becomes a matter of semantics.
My views on government affairs are a mixed bag, but generally view things from the "Left", but like your quote from Chris Rock... views and positions need to be taken on a case by case basis.
@_date: 2013-07-14 15:54:30
I use it to buy electronics from a website that excepts them. Pretty sure the MIB aren't following me.
Oh Alan Greenspan is not a shining example when quoting someone.
Ok seriously though, no more fighting dude, I am in a relatively relaxed mood right now. So sorry if any offense was committed.
@_date: 2013-07-17 16:08:19
This is my problem too. There are simply to many wealthy powerful organizations that we can't control. The government is there to in a sense regulate them and we have democratic control over the government (even if we are never happy with all their decisions).
@_date: 2013-06-17 23:47:33
Not sure why someone would downvote for a question. I would Seriously like to get in the mind of the person. Its a pity because they are the ones that NEVER comment on why. 
Not like I was asking a political question, it baffles the mind to think someone can read my question and think I don't like this, time to downvote. Angry souls out there, oh well digress
@_date: 2013-06-28 15:03:30
@_date: 2013-07-14 16:57:11
Ok that is damn simple, so were talking a couple of hours at most and I can have my BTC.
@_date: 2013-07-14 09:48:14
What bothers me most they don't give the slightest clue when they will be back. Are we talking a couple of days or a few weeks?
So far each time used them it worked fine, but when I get cash to buy coins this week if they are not back up they will likely lose my business permanently. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 16:03:38
This has made me realize that a Formal poll would likely be useless, as the differing opinions on what is or not in political definitions are too different.
I would assign your views more Libertarian, with the exception of money out of politics. In my mind, a Libertarians believe we should be able to spend money any way we want including political contributions.
@_date: 2013-07-15 00:22:17
Great, thanks.
@_date: 2013-07-17 02:20:31
Ok relatively anonymous compared to other currencies. Things always need to be compared to what is relative.
@_date: 2013-08-15 13:27:36
Money is money. It is the principal of it, and of course for posterity purposes (it is all about the posterity).
@_date: 2013-07-11 15:35:22
Oh sorry about the dude, ma'am ok? JK. I appreciate the help. I will look deeper into this.
@_date: 2013-03-16 17:49:43
Well, I have of course checked out any wikis, I was hoping for something someone may have heard about in recent months (studies, statistics, etc.).
@_date: 2013-07-17 13:40:26
Never said anything of the sort, what gives?
@_date: 2013-08-30 13:13:46
The way I see it is great ideas don't need people actively supporting it with little or no net value. That zealotry must be questioned.
Another thing, there are some respectful people on this sub that are clearly intelligent, but then there the psychopaths that treat BTC like it is there wife and flip when you say anything critical.
But to be fair now there are people (trolls) that come here and bash BTC with the intention of setting off emotions.
@_date: 2013-07-14 17:24:18
Thanks that really is helpful.
@_date: 2013-07-16 04:55:10
I still need to keep my eye on LTC, just for posterity if nothing else.
@_date: 2013-07-11 13:16:21
Really? I tried localbitcoins and found some local but got no response.
@_date: 2013-07-14 15:09:40
Sweet what buyer (if that is okay to ask). I am beginning to feel confident with this.
And how fast did they take to respond to your message.
@_date: 2013-07-16 04:53:54
Guess you have a good point when it comes to goverment fiat. So if anything government fiat has something to lose.
