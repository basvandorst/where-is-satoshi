Robinhood is the catalist for the next run. Lots of new money.

Or just back the next currency and make bitcoin the Myspace of cryptos.

Satoshi is two people. Him and Nick.

You folks are neglecting the fact that in a free market Bitcoin has to compete with another currencies. There is no central entity forging its use.
If I were a late adopter, I would prefer to adopt another currency just because I think hodlers don't deserve to be the new feudal lords. So fuck you I don't want to use the coin you control. Sounds familiar?
And remember savings is something that will have value tomorrow, not today.

Thanks. Is there any etiquette to be followed for that?

100k apparently.

Thank you! Why would anyone oppose to that?

You don't understand it if you cannot explain it.

Shouldn't we support Monero instead? It looks to me it is what Bitcoin should have been from the beginning.
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:51:59
Wrong. If you have no doubts with an investment it is probably a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:10:06
Try us.

Monero was born to avoid this.
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:18:29
It is like Bitcoin but with fungible coins and private transactions.

TL;DR?
