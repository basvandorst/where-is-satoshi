The real question to ask is ...
Would Data's brain be able to design a better ASIC chip to mine with?
The answer is most definitely, yes!
@_date: 2014-05-27 03:01:41
Right, just like everything right now is 95% explained.

Bullshit.  Anyone who followed Gox prices on an intraday basis for a year or two could see quite clearly that there was manipulation behind the scenes.  Has everyone forgotten the Gox loop "bug" already?  That was when NOBODY could enter trades but the market went into a cyclical pattern.
How can a market go into a cyclical pattern when nobody can execute trades?  Well, the answer is quite easily when the code for setting the asset price is a hack built upon more hacks.

Why would anyone want to give money to Cointerra.  They haven't even paid all their refund requests yet.  The company is likely heading for bankruptcy.  They made a crappy product and are now scrambling to deal with the fallout.

Except, there were no algos to do the trading.  Whenever this happened, and it did several times, nobody was able to trade.  So it's a "built in" algorithm that they tried to explain as a database rollback.  I never bought the argument then and I definitely don't now given what eventually happened to Gox.

The machines under perform and the company is shady.  They have a C- BBB rating and it's likely to go down further.  Simply put, they are in over their head.  About 50% of the machines delivered fail and you'll be lucky to get it fixed (returned to you) in less than a month.  Go do some reading on their own forums and you'll see what I mean.

Yeah, Cointerra is in trouble.  They are in way beyond their depth.  Big things to consider:
1.  it's unlikely that your machine will achieve the TH speed they claim
2.  you have a 50% chance of getting a dead unit
3.  you'll be lucky to get a reply from customer support in less than a week
4.  you'll be lucky to get a dead unit repaired and returned in less than a month, missing at least 2 more difficulty levels.
It's not as good a picture as they are painting.  Too bad.  They coulda been a contender.

Without opening your case, here are some things:
1.  Make sure the room is no hotter than 75F
2.  Try power stepping down to 8 or 7
3.  Try power stepping down to 1, then slowly stepping back up to 8 or 9 in 1 step increments... waiting about 5 minutes in between each.
I often go 1,3,5,7,8 ... 9 (depending if it can stay below 100C on the chip at 9).

Yeah, it seems as though CT is in trouble.  I can't help but feel this is just like Mt. Gox.  Here we have yet another company basically run by one guy who is in way beyond his depth.

Why the 11/1/13 cutoff?  I bought my machines in early December of 2013 ... 
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:50:00
Because reasons?

Or it may be completely worthless. I don't think it helps to spin baseless hype. Note, I've mined BTC with GPUs and ASICs. I was an early adopter. But unless the devs address some key issues, BTC (and other cryptos) may be in trouble.

Why not just start an organization that accepts bitcoins on his behalf, then give him cash and/or organize fund raisers, dinners, etc...
