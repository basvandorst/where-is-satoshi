He definitely deserves but share the wealth!!!

What would a ledger S Nano be considered? Cold?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:24:29
Not sure...all of us will be dead.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:30:31
Yes we’ll be dead before they are all mined.

I am a graphic designer and I noticed two things here:
1. $40 for a tshirt
2. White tshirts
If you want someone to buy your tshirts it has to be an impulse purchase price. No way in hell would I pay $40 for a white tshirt. Also, no one really likes white tshirts. You have to have a variety of colors to choose from. Just saying from a guy who knows and sells tshirts...

Yep I bought $200 worth of bitcoin, bank transfer, got the confirmation email that day saying I bought 0.01492651 BTC. Then today I got an email saying my $200 USD transfer was completed in GDAX and now my GDAX account says I have $200 USD.
So freaking pissed right now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:07:18
I noticed that and used the desktop to see what my fees would be...
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:24:23
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:52:28
So why the the actual price of $15k that the contract was for?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:29:29
A lot of people did when they couldn't buy or sell...grrr.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:37:52
So close!! Unless you've seen a ticker above $14k....
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:16:31
It would be worse if you could buy and sell instantly...
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:04:33
I think he's right the real threat is the exchanges can't handle large loads. We've seen this in the past few weeks...When everyone really needs to sell because it's going to plummet we won't be able to sell and loose our money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:12:52
I️ got in today when it dipped to $13,198! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:48:56
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:05:52
I'm asking for it for my present from my brother! And also a Ledger S Nano!
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:01:05
Come on dude what vote...
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:58:20
Do you know why Coinbase's current price and buying prices are different? For some reason I can't make a post about this topic...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:31:59
Hopefully not a pump for the dump on the 18th...
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:00:17
Coinbase is not a real wallet, you don't own your bitcoin if you keep it on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:29:49
From here I would invest small amounts when ever you can, then they will add up over time...I got in last at $13,198. I'm waiting to see what happens on the 18th after CME.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:38:12
Same Same.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:26:47
I think there's ways to prevent that. My friend working in Lebanon can't buy off Coinbase...
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:36:09
Charity is great and all, yet most never really spend it on their actual cause. It usually goes to paychecks or frivolous things. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:51:08
If you don't ever loose your keys it might be the safest place. On you at all times. And it looks just like a USB drive so none the wiser...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:43
How you much you willing to pay?!? Ha 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:01:00
I like to use google.

You can actually create money out of thin air. What ever a collective of people decide to give value too is then considered money...Gold has no value but we give it value. The dollar is just a piece of paper...
Let's all get on board and start trading Nuka-Cola bottle caps...
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:29:47
Hmmm we don't know for sure, there isn't even a dollar sign...
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:25:23
Came to say this!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:19:35
It says only have $200 in USD
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:00:52
Can you suggest where I get a paper wallet? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:12:51
I’ve talked with two support people from Coinbase. I️ feel like they know nothing! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:31:40
Open up GDAX and just watch the price in the browser tab...
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:05:08
Could you explain some more?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:06:26
I thought futures started on the 18th?
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:54:59
Ah yes I would love bitcoin as a Christmas gift thank you soooo much! /s
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:46:27
As a graphic designer the typography isn't the best...
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:36:39
Why looking on Coinbase, why is the current price lower than the buying price?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:43:05
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:37:48
Not worth it?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:38:24
I finally got a hold til we get to you response...
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:26:51
Guess I’ll move from Coinbase to GDAX buy more then hardware wallet...
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:22:32
Of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:58:26
Whoa Whoa Whoa, it may be unlucky to you but not for me. My lucky number is 13! Also there have been some unsavory connotations associated with the number 13. It's actually not an unlucky number like you've been lead to believe...
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:38:20
It isn't about spending the money at the moment it's about investing and making money...
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:23:30
He tried it didn't work for some reason.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:28:41
How do forks work? Do we have to have money on the exchange to receive the new forked currency?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:38:20
Do you know why Coinbase's current price doesn't match the buying price at the same moment?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:42:26
I’d like to know the answers to these questions too! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:13:07
If my calculations from this site are correct it would cost you more to mine than you would make...?!?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:26:05
At least your locked into the price.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:54:25
Got some sources on the forks?
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:07:27
Wow so personal, a bot...
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:44:44
Where do you go to verify the bank account?
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:08:17
Right now it's only accounts from 2013-2015 I believe. But always report your earnings...
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:36:46
If I don't have any of my coins on an exchange during a fork will I still get the new currency?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:08:47
Cool so you will get the forked coins even if you have your bits in a wallet. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:36:44
This is exactly what I was thinking. It was a bit of a correction for crazy ups and downs...
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:11:49
Okay, thanks. I just wanted to confirm I got it at the purchase point it said it was at at the time.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:52:37
Since when did 4th graders own house and buy bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:27:46
It's nice going to sleep at $14k and waking up to a steady $16-17k...
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:29:53
Did your stuff move pretty fast on this platform?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:39:09
The great thing about Bitcoin is people against it usually say it's the government's job to create the money. Yet our own government hasn't been in-charge of our money system for quite some time!!!
What a great argument.... /s
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:46:37
I bought coins on Dec 6th on coinbase, received the confirmation email, then today got an email saying that I deposited $200 into GDAX...and I don't have any bitcoin just USD...
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:26:31
Wow, lets just say karma's a bitch and you'll get yours my friend. Eric!
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:22:13
Do people using this service sell less than one bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:07:17
Share the Wealth, Sell, Profit?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:03:37
Thought so I just hadn't seen it before.
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:15:50
This is a ruse to down play bitcoin. People will associate bitcoin with candy now... 
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:43:54
Because it creates inflation. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:34:29
How did that get so popular so fast? 
@_date: 2019-03-30 16:25:08
I read there's only about 2 Billion in physical cash in circulation in the US.
@_date: 2019-03-14 00:32:16
The optimal thing would be that the central banks not have the authority to print money for a country that they aren't actually apart of...The FED was established when the 3 men that opposed it all died on the Titanic...
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:47:10
I think OP is just realizing that central banks create money out of thin air. That's the problem these banks shouldn't have the ability to do this....Currently there is only around 2.2 billion US dollars in circulation in the US, the rest is just made up of 1s &amp; 0s...
@_date: 2019-03-13 21:29:25
Everything you listed is small potatoes compared to the Billions and Billions the central banks keep printing every year...
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:09:58
GDAX wants me to transfer USD into the exchange then buy the bitcoin. Does it take the same time as buying the coin itself to make that transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:15:39
Can't wait to get my ledger and get off coinbase...
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:11:33
So when then futures trading opens up do you think most people will bet for it and not against? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:50:13
You could go digital wallet and get the ledger s nano. It’s what I’m asking for for the holidays! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:30:20
I'm also pretty new, but from a few videos I've watched they say that your mobile device is more secure than a desktop so they are the way to go. I'm asking for a Ledger S Nano for the holidays though.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:23:59
Should I buy more now or wait? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:34:36
Everyone saying there might be an adjustment? Should I just bit the bullet and buy more?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:41:50
We give gold it's value because but it's just a mineral...Why not, in the digital age, give bitcoin value because it's time has come...IDK.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:12:39
It doesn't show up when i search for it on OSX.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:46
Kinda fishy...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:17:05
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:47:55
Oh I’m hodling!
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:39:56
One function of a government is to create currency. What in the actual hell...The United States doesn't even create its own currency what a hypocrite!!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:07:00
No we can't use the pronouns boys and girls these days we might offend someone. Yet I'm offended that I can't use them, and the cycle continues...
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:42:46
I’m not scared and also only $200 big time Woohoo 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:22:11
Thanks! Is now the time to buy more? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:21:37
It's also for transaction of $20,000 or more I believe.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:45:29
When's that fruit cup dip being served?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:35:48
Got any real advice though?
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:16:05
Ouch. I’m new but I was told from the beginning about the dips and to always hodl. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:52:08
I bought just two weeks ago at $6400 I'm kicking myself I didn't buy more!
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:07:12
But feels good to be a part of this!
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:25:00
What's everyone thoughts on He could actually be an AI...
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:30:58
When do you think that will happen? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:25:14
Do you know, does the Ledger website take USD? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:19:11
It's done alot in the last few days, it needs some breathing room! lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:15:04
I don't have much invested I'm still WAY up. Hoping to buy more if this is a true dip.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:18:08
I'd be interested in this as well!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:58:02
I was going to get one off Amazon, should I go directly to Ledger?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:52:13
Thanks! Does it work well with Mac?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:34:47
My buddy who follows bitcoin news pretty regularly said something about $60,000 by late 2018. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:02:10
Electrum is that only for Android?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:31:14
I've only had bitcoin for two weeks now but from my research: Use Coinbase.com to purchase your coins. Mobile wallets are more secure than desktop, and hardware wallets are the most secure. i.e. Ledger S Nano
I would invest. Anytime is a good time to do so. There could be a dip coming with bitcoin reaching $10K but no one knows for sure.
First rule of bitcoin if you don't own your keys, you don't own your bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:07:27
Oh I thought that GDAX had cheaper fees for buying the coins. I should just use coinbase then?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:06
Gold has no intrinsic value, either do 1’s and O’s, yet both have value because we give it to it. It’s possible Bitcoins time has come and more people want in! If less people want less gold, dollars, euros... and more bitcoins, well follow the money right...
In the video game Fall Out the game uses bottle caps as currency.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:55:20
Same here. I didn't know much but my buddy helped me through the buying process then when I owned some I've done tons of research on it and feel way better about my next steps!
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:41:37
Ugh...well I won't get anywhere near that!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:49:30
What wallet are you using?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:25:56
And she did!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:52:50
Then there's people like me that only invested $200 and are not rich, still struggles pay check to pay check. But it's still fun to watch my small amount go up. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:08:38
Thank you! Much appreciated. I really love this community and how everyone is very cordial! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:18:30
Ah thank you kindly!
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:44:03
Yes but only for that transaction, not to live there.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:53:24
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:19:50
From my research people are saying to wait til the drop, but when will that happen. I wanna buy MOAR!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:18:51
Yet TenK is only on I believe 8,340ish zombies but he’s catching up!! lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:00:02
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:41:08
Found it, someone's going to eat their left nut! Roger that!
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:15:45
Sorry sorry...
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:37:45
I only bought in $200 as well! I was lucky enough to catch the last dip though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:16:51
How can so many different exchanges have different prices?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:10:25
Wish I had bought more when it dipped to $6400
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:44:00
It’s the same thing though. It increases because we give it value and when more people see that they buy in giving it more value. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:36:31
Yeah my .0303 bitcoin is not impressive...
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:00:16
Why’s that? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:15:31
Did they provide a reason?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:41:57
I'm cooling my jets and calming down a bit. I will see what tomorrow brings and then decide!
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:31:06
Roger that!
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:50:26
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:29:15
Do they take USD?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:53:17
It’s very possible!! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:13:54
Buy moar!
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:41:08
I was being sarcastic...sorry to anyone I did offend!
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:14:18
Why then does a lot of advice on here say to use coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:36:36
What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:47:05
Thanks I needed that! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:29:09
I saw someone say the same thing yesterday...how about reaching $10k and staying at $10k be two different things?!?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:26:49
Annnnnd it's back down...and up....and down....
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:54
Diversify right? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:42:43
Simple. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:54:45
Just need to hodl and we'll all be rich in 2 years!
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:08:18
Can you explain limit orders a bit more please? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:56:51
Is there another fork happening? How does that work? Do we get the same amount we have currently in the new fork? Thanks.
