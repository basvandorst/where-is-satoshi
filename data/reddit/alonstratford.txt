I did two withdrawal transactions on Bitfinex this month. I looked at the change from those transactions and the change from both moved today and was pooled into an address that exactly matches my balance. I suspect that means my BTC are still in Bitfinex's possession.

This. I think that Preet Bharara would love to talk to Mark about Silk Road.

I bought 10 original series with the error. Trust me, you would have given them away like I did.

I reported the google shortened link to google. I'd suggest others do it to by going to goo.gl and clicking "Report Spam"

Anyways, chickens are not money. First, the price is very volatile, probably. Also, chickens are very illiquid as they are solid. Further, they are hard to secure as they can fly and walk away. Additionally, they aren't backed by any government. I expect the price of chickens to go to zero any day now.

True, but it's from a well-respected NYTimes blog, so I think it's interesting. The author is well-credentialed, undoubtedly smart, and has several crazy notions about bitcoin that he probably didn't personally make up but heard talking to other well-credentialed people. I know that I've been in the bitcoin bubble so long, I almost forget sometimes that most people know little or less about how the bitcoin eco-system works. So seeing what smart, well-connected people are getting "basic" things wrong is an important reminder that for most people this is all still radically new.

Why is this article not worth a person's time? Lot's of people read Salmon and he's a well respected journalist. It's fine to think him wrong--I know I do--but that doesn't make this less interesting. What's especially interesting to me is to the extent that his views reflect or do not reflect the evolving "conventional wisdom" of on Bitcoin in the financial press.

This, from the article, is cracking me up: "Could it be that this coding genius is instead enjoying computer-manufactured riches on some remote, tax-free island, or is he a cyber-terrorist who upon Bitcoin adoption will activate a Trojan-horse virus to bring world commerce back to the Stone Age?"

Amazing article!

Regulators probably can't do that, obviously. But tirelessly working to shutdown Bitcoin exchanges could do a lot of damage. I would say that Lawsky's hearings were unexpectedly Bitcoin-friendly compared to my expectations (which is that regulators would act and sounds like Salmon). But Bitcoin is still in its early days and not yet threatening in the halls of power. What happens when Bitcoin is 10x bigger?

Maybe that's the case, but what if he heard it from like-minded person. Like, are there former commodity trader executives, bank examiners, and professors talking to each other about how bitcoin is a Trojan-horse virus to bring world commerce back to the Stone Age? That's funny, but also kind of weird. How would they have come to believe that? And why would they believe it? The elite non-techie bank world is starting to develop very strange notions about bitcoin.

Patent Attorney here. If a client asked us to pay in bitcoins, we'd just treat it like another way to pay. Chickens? Not so much.

I really would like to read a book about these generals.

This, a thousand times. Silly redditors read the title and think that the patent application is asking for a patent covering the entire scope of the title. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:34:13
These are patent application publications. They are published *before* the patent office looks at them.

Why should eliminating government eliminate inflation? While bitcoin may not permit inflation, the bitcoin technology allows for the creation of new crypto-currencies. Even if bitcoin has a fixed limit, there is no limit on the total number of crypto-currencies. Further, there is an incentive to create and promote these currencies to be "the next bitcoin" or to satisfy some need not satisfied by bitcoin (as is the case for namecoin). I would call this process of creating new crypto-currencies a form of inflation.

How is that more effective than mining in bitcoin?

I treat Coinbase as having two big risks: 1.) having their bank account seized by a state or Federal Government (like Mt. Gox in April), or 2.) having their bitcoins hot wallet stolen. I treat 1.) as highly likely, at some point they will have their bank accounts seized. However, since they don't appear to let users carry dollar balances (that I can see), I think that when this occurs it might have a minimal impact on a user's bitcoin balance. So the second risk is the big one. Since we can't audit their security, the only sensible thing to do is to leave only the amount of bitcoins on the server as you can comfortably lose. If losing that bitcoin would be a disaster, you should look harder into some sort of cold wallet.

Hmm... If you eyeball this [chart]( it appears that they did approximately 200,000 transactions through November. Add 100,000 as a high estimate of December so far, and you still get an average transaction size of $333. What are people buying that would lead to such a high average transaction size?

A decent point. But consider this: If the alternative crypto-currencies use similar code, they should be somewhat substitutable for bitcoin. At the very least, for payment processing systems that use bitcoin it should be relatively straightforward to include support for bitcoin-like crypto-currencies. Further, market demand will likely encourage payment processing systems to do so. In such a case, if there is bitcoin and inflationcoin, say, customers would likely prefer to spend inflationcoins first rather than spend increasingly valuable bitcoins. So even though, bitcoins themselves wouldn't be inflating, the actual world of commerce would see inflation in crypto-currencies actually being used.

I think they are at high risk of seizure because, afaik, they do not have state money transmitter licenses. Only once they have those licenses will I feel comfortable that the are unlikely to have have their accounts seized by governments.
