No no it is a fork in the wider world of crypto
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:13:15
Sounds like a fork
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:39:22
When I want to learn about any subject I start to educate myself. Then when I encounter controversies like in bidcoin: whether it's about the claim Bitcoin is a scam- Bitcoin is digital gold or the scaling debate.... I will always look to both sides. And then I will see. Then when it becomes for instance verry technical. I know one thing for sure: the experts like dr. Wright or Ver who are REALY good in drama, cursing and being angry and shouting are not the "intellectuals " who will educate me.... The people like Antonopoulus an Black are the ones who I prefer to try to understand!!!
Study for yourself; not that difficult.

Okay I’m sorry, now I see where I go wrong. Did comment on the reddit post of the app itself. Was thinking I did comment on an other (bbc.com ?) article which I read elsewhere on reddit (/science?) in which is also a reference to Alex de Vries... so....
I’m sorry for mixing up..
Still not sure how realistic the app is and who is behind it. Therefore I was a bit dissing whit the Alex name.
And yes I’m not taking the task at hand to make a inquiry for more info on this...

Exactly; those words are called the seed (12 or 24 words) plus you can choose a password on top of that which gives extra features.  Read about it on the website of Satoshilab (Trezor.io) the creators of Trezor hardware wallet. Good to learn also if your not that tech savvy. First experiment with small amounts! Than you can do the real thing and become a real holder or spender. Success it can be fun!

Okay, for Shamir and multisig you need multiple party’s. Party’s you’ve to trust.. ,could come in danger for holding part of your money..Key splitting less save. Good custodial services are really welcome in time. Better not banks with same terms as they hold for money...
@_date: 2019-11-23 12:28:56
@_date: 2019-11-30 10:30:32
No no my friend, I’m really interested in the subject and if you read properly not pro banks or fearful of them overtaking BTC. Holding safe without screwing up your own coin or getting stolen or robbed isn’t that easy as you make it seem.
Shamir without sharing with others makes you the only point of failure..
Shamir / multisig / timelock etc. can be useful for constructing a good holding scheme. Custodial services will most probably become part of that scheme.

Segway is and was Bitcoin development.
LTC a Bitcoin tech clone. Implemented segregated witness first. Could be seen as a test case but was more a statement en evidence to the Bitcoin scaling discussion. In the rest of your story I can’t find any altcoin tech adopted in the Bitcoin protocol... 
I’m aware of the possibility to adopt tech from alts  but don’t know if such already happened . I’m not very software tech developed and up to date on al those alts but very interested for where we speak of.

World isn’t black or white.
Custodial services have also advantages. 
As soon they know, bad people can make you tell where your gold is hidden in your yard. Same for your private keys.
Kidnapping, bank robbery or blackmailing to get your fortune out of custody i.e. the bank is a different level of crime…

Am I crazy..???  


In reply to your question; I do think the price is anyhow mostly based on speculation.
Your story on the price movement whit in a year is absolute incorrect.
Even after that 


price was stil up 700%. Or do you think we are still in a weird spike??
Better correct your article on this or be a .....

After the first halving:
 &gt; It was almost a year before we had any serious price movement and it did not seem related to the halving at all.
Halving was end 2012 (28 november) and beginning 2013 rally from about $13/Btc to $266/Btc at Gox!!
**Thats &gt;2000% value increase!! In 4.5 months!!**

Completely out of context; no one in BTC gets murdered in a war even when speculating with more than they can lose.
Don’t compare the D-day suffering with money you can lose...

I did investigate for my self whether bitaddress was a safe tool to generate paper wallets/cold storage ofline some 3 years ago.
There was some mentioning of poor random number generator in Java but overall the comments where that bitaddress was okay to use..
Now where do we stand now?!
Should we move from cold storage generated by bit address to some other methode?
And if so; which will that be when most of us don't understand all kinds of bips and data dumps or what ever more technical methods there are.
