I encountered this issue earlier in the week with the dip and my first time using CB-Pro. I was able to whittle the time down to about a day by depositing cash into CB, then once that cleared, I moved it to CB-Pro.

It is easy and accessible for those who are just started dipping their toes into crypto and may not be knowledgeable in finance.
Think of it as a starting zone in a MMO. Get the basics down, go from there.

This concept is outdated. I had hooked up the corpse of Alexander Hamilton in his grave to my rigs and have been powering 200TH/s worth of ever since.

I did it like that with the CB -&gt; CB Pro transfer. The hold is way shorter, but they still hold it at least 12 hours (I deposited it 6pm on the 25th in CB, was able to transfer and place a buy order 5am on the 26th. I had to go into my emails and trade log to confirm that).
I personally feel its better to have a small amount of funds at the ready for opportunities, or just pay the extra dollar or two for the instant market buys. When it dipped below 9500 I didn't want to wait the 12 hours and just bought at market using CB.
What is your verification tier on CB?

Imagine the transaction fees for that block though!
