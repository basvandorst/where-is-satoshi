Based on your first response I think we are too far apart in this debate to ever come to an understanding. As for your second response, I do think it's strange to equate air with a river. A river, and the water that runs through it is tangible, air is not. I've never heard of a case where someone claimed possession of air.

Like I said, we are too far apart on the issue. To me your entire response seems like a contradiction.

I would appreciate you clarifying two points. Do you believe a property owner has a right to pollute their own property? Also, where and when has air ever been considered property?

I think this is a huge draw back for bitcoins.

Yea, I noticed every time someone criticized *his ideas* or *his abilities* he tried to turn it around as an attack on the whole community to garner  support.

I'm confused, don't you want to attract more retailers, even if they are novices?

Second favorite quote. No honey, that's *not* what they're thinking!

Can you imagine working for someone like that?

Sure there is, a pure capitalist would have no problem off loading the negative costs and negative consequences onto a third party or another generation. Capitalism is more concerned with short term gains than long term costs to the environment, health, economy etc. Future generations having to put up with polluted air and water because other generations feared regulating businesses seems like a pretty fucking "non-voluntary" consequence to me.

This is hilarious, thanks for sharing. My favorite quote so far:

Yea, he really lost me when he went off about democracy being bribery and the government being reasonable for kowtowing to bankers desires because the bankers lend *their* money to bribe citizens. How does this so called bribery account for sales taxes, income taxes, property taxes, phone taxes etc? Maybe banks work differently in Canada, but in this country I'm pretty sure banks lend the money of depositors, not "future generations." Yes, I know we are a republic.
