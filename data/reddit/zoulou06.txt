No one can predict the future but we can make hypothesis can't we?
So, what if...? (Worst case scenarios). 
Nb: all worst case scenario's summary is here [here (permalink)](
**5. Bank's hostile takeover of the bitcoin exchange market:**
Let's take the example of bitcoin.de and Fidor. Let's say Fidor expand together with bitcoin.de to the point where most europeans would choose to secure (and speed up) all their bitcoin transactions by trading them solely in beetween Fidor's bank accounts, rather than with SEPA transfer. Isn't Fidor going to take over the European exchange platform market? Further on, to allow banks to secure our transactions isn't going to lead to the centralization of bitcoins?
Edit: grammar

I want to stick to the same wallet for a life time in the fashion of *"set it and forget it"*. Is it okay to not update my wallet's client for a very long period of time (meaning many, many years)?

**4. Huge and sudden loss of bitcoin:**
Let's say an entity owning a very large quantity of bitcoin would vanish, leading to some disastrous plummeting, is the bitcoin ever going to recover?

So, what if...? (Worst case scenarios).
I am nowhere close to be an expert in bitcoin and English is not my mother tongue, so please bare with me if I take this opportunity to ask nonsensical questions with improper grammar. For ease of use I will ask a new question for each of my worst case scenarios. Here is a summary to facilitate search in this thread:
1. [Weakened blockchain.](
2. [Quantum computer's owners takeover.](
3. [Deflationary spiral (hoarding).](
4. [Huge and sudden loss of bitcoin.](
5. [Bank's hostile takeover of the bitcoin exchange market.](
6. [Bitcoin becoming worthless in favor of other crypto-currencies.](

**2.Quantum computer's owners takeover:**
Let's say super large-scale quantum computers are made available to super rich persons/entities in a nearby future. In other words let's say the vast majority of bitcoin creation volume is held by only a handful of people, wouldn't the bitcoin economy mostly be controlled by those people thus making them richer than the richest?

True, that would work... but I would not take the risk to misspell one letter today or to read it wrong in ten years from now. Flash codes are performing this task much better than I ever would, and most important : handwritten notes would not be so pretty to look at! lol

Is it possible to switch wallet's clients and to keep the same pass phrase? In other words, do I have to get a new pass phrase every time I transfer bitcoins to a different wallet?

Safe printing, how does it work?
I created my Electrum cold storage wallet on a usb pen running Tails OS and I want to print a paper wallet. My smart printer is usually connected to the Internet via my private network. I believe it's completely safe to go offline, to reboot my computer from the usb pen, to print my "bitcoin notes" from Tails, to reboot from Windows OS and to go back online. Doing this should not leave any trace of the printed document on my computer. Problem is I don't trust my printer's internal memory! 
Isn't it safe enough to go the easier way without involving Tails and to print my document from Windows while being offline, then to flush my printer memory simply by rebooting my computer?

**1.Weakened blockchain:**
Let's say web based and light weight wallets become more and more popular to the point no one would download and check the blockchain in the older Bitcoin's clients. Further on, let's say the mining cost would not provide enough incentive anymore for the miners to keep going. How the blockchain is going to be secured?

**6. Bitcoin becoming worthless in favor of other crypto-currencies:**
Let's say the number of crypto-currencies would keep expanding to the point they create more wealth than bitcoin mining. Isn't bitcoin going to become worthless when compared to the value of the most stable and popular alternative crypto-currencies?

**3. Deflationary spiral (hoarding):**
The common practice here being *"buy as much bitcoins as you can afford to loose and spend them as late as possible"*, aren't we on the edge of a deflationary spiral?
