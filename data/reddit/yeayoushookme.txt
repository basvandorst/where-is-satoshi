But isn't the bootstrap.dat basically the blockchain from the beginning?


As I see it, it puts a load on the people's internet connections sharing the blockchain. It shouldn't matter whether they're doing it with bitcoin or bittorrent.
What am I missing??

This is the first time I've heard of this. Is it Open Hardware?

Why get an outdated version of the blockchain via the bittorrent protocol, when you can be up-to-date with the bitcoin protocol? 
Why would I seed that file, when I could also run a node?

There will be no more than 21 million Bitcoins unless the protocol changes. Bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places, therefore, there will be 2.1*10^15 Satoshis. 
Bitcoin uses ECDSA asymmetryc crypto for signing, with 256bit private keys, so you can have 10^77 different private keys. Even if you transfer every Satoshi to a different address, the very vast majority of addresses will remain empty.
Public keys are what you see as Bitcoin addresses, plus the addresses have some error correction to avoid losing coins due to typos. Private keys are in your wallet, and each one is mathematically linked to a public key (Bitcoin address) in a one-way manner: one can verify that you are in fact in possession of your secret key, with having access only to your public key, and no access to your secret key. For more information, look up *asymmetryc cryptography* and *digital signatures*.
There's an excellent video explaining asymmetryc crypto by using paint as an analogy. It should be among the first search results, if you don't know much about cryptography, that's where you should start.

plus an unknown amount that went to random addresses that you can request from their bot on IRC.
I wouldn't donate to their advertised address.

I guess you're somewhat lucky that you only lost so much. Had you consolidated your bitcoins into a single account, you'd now have nothing left. These hacky clients are scary.

Are nV cards competitive at all? Just asking because I fell out of the mining game a while ago with my HD5850, because power's a bit expensive at my place.

[This thread on a Venn diagram](
@_date: 2012-10-28 14:15:50
If the pool exists as a TOR hidden service, and you register, and connect to the pool RPC using TOR, then there will be no way of identifying you until the coin pops up in a transaction initiated from a machine on the internet using a public IP.
(I don't know if a hidden pool exists or not, so this is all theoretical)

Forget bruteforcing it. You have 58^25 possible variations, so you have at least 128 bits to crack. That would *literally* take septillions of years. The only way is to find a backup.

Or a zombie acting as a tunnel. Worth a shot though.

Would be fixed with the next update that will make the client reject blocks that have no transactions in them (or a more correct fix, reject blocks that have no transactions *if there are any pending transactions*).
Your 20 mil mining rig ain't worth a thing if nobody gives a damn about your fake ass blocks.

The day my GPU revved up because of a rogue Bitcoin miner was the day I switched to Linux. True story.

I'd be glad if I knew. Browsers have exploits, I guess some infected website is to blame.
