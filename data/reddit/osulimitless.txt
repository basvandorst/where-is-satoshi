About two months ago Keytern.al finally emailed me with a bitcoin address to send the 99$ recovery fee to, which I did right away. However I still don't have my wallet recovered and can't get keytern.al to  answer any email.
Bitgo has emailed me asking if I ever got my wallet recovered which just shows how in the dark they are with keytern.al, I can't find evidence anywhere that Keytern.al has actually ever recovered a wallet before or any schedule of when their next ceromony will be.
BitGo mentioned theyre so backlogged with amounts of wallets that need recovered Keytern is going to increase the ceromonies to more than 4 times a year...

No. Keyternal responds with a public key address saying they will wait 48 hours to broadcast a recovery transaction.
I used the public key they emailed to make a new Wallet with Bitgo and told them but Keyternal won't respond what so ever.
I have been emailing BitGo asking them what my next step is or if Keyternal has EVER recovered someone's wallet and they just give an auto response saying
"We're sorry to hear you are having this continued issue, I need to engage some additional resources and will update you with new information as it becomes available"
And then they don't say anything after and if you don't comment on a ticket for more than a week they close it and send you a message saying "We haven't heard from you in a week we assume your issue is fixed"
This seriously sucks... I'm about to use my YouTube channel and advertise all this and explain to people to boycott BitGo.
