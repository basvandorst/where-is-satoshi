Yes, you can.  Standard wipe procedure where I work is 7 passes with random bits.  We wouldn't take the time to wipe it more than once if that was all that was needed.

It's overkill no doubt, but it makes them feel nice.

I don't think anyone can tell you when, but I think some people on here would be better suited to give you an estimate than me.  
My thinking is to just look out for entities who make a lot of transactions and when they start to use segwit, that should signal more adoption of actually using segwit and give you an idea of how widespread use of segwit will be.

I've been using this link to watch fees.

People have to actually use segwit, and there is still a lot of pending transactions.  It will improve gradually, not immediately.

Altcoin miners often convert their earnings to Bitcoin.  I would say that it does impact Bitcoin.
Not to mention, that as altcoin prices go up (which is in correlation with Bitcoin) the demand for the GPUs go up which helps Nvidia and AMD substantially.

People here saying BCH is still cheaper, thus proving hurrr durrr cash is better still don't have a clear understanding on the bigger picture.  
Don't forget if BCH really was bitcoin it would be more valuable in USD and those extra satoshis would make it more expensive.  Since BCH is trying to overtake BTC, this is obviously really bad for BCH.

Interestingly, the US government has tons of TOR nodes set up to try and peel back layers from its anonymity.  
I wouldn't be shocked if any state entity decided if it was beneficial to have majority nodes and/or hashrate to actually do what they could with BTC (or alts) as well, particularly if it meant having the ability to compromise privacy.
