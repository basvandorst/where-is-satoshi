'Lord of Lite, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false coins. Take them and cast your lite upon us, for the night is dark and full of sellers'

Listen to this shit. So I actually did a little research into BitCoin in 2014 during my first deployment to Afghanistan back when BC was sitting at around 600$ and thought it was a cool idea. I didn't have enough disposable cash so in the end I decided to stay out and promptly forgot about it. Then in 2016 while in college someone mentioned it, and I was actually in a more stable position financially so I REALLY REALLY REALLY considered buying in, but, in the end, decided to go fuck Filipino chicks for two weeks. :( 
Fast forward to november fucking 25th. Again, back in the caustic wasteland of Afghanistan (this time as a contractor making like 6 times what I made in the army) I hop on Facebook and see that Bitcoin has been jumping at an insane rate (shit Wi-Fi, and 12.5 hour shifts had shielded me from info that BC had actually changed in value after it's seemingly 50 year hibernation). As a fellow techie, and huge proponent of making money, I immediately make a CoinBase account and link bank/etc. I eagerly sift through the media quagmire of misinformation and blatant attempts by entrenched banking institutions to Sabatoge what I see as one of this centuries greatest inventions in search of real data in order to decide which currency to hedge my bet. After seeing currencies continue to make astronomical gains, I settle on my choice; Litecoin, 6:30 P.M my time, 102.5 dollars per LTC. 
My fingers faintly shake as I open the app and enter the transaction amount. Roughly 6700$ total (a months pay here working 87.5 hrs/week). I hesitate, fully understanding that there is a chance the currency could tank, but my eyes cloud over, and all I can see are those crisp, gleaming green numbers skyrocketing ever higher, towards what number no one yet knows. As I hesitate, I see someone off in the distance. I focus my internal gaze and see a younger version of myself. 
Raised in poverty, and freshly exposed to the world, younger me has only three goals in life. Get rich, take care of my little sister/future family (unlike my parents), and make sure not to lose myself in the process. To make sure that I stay true to my slightly skewed moral code of trying to be a decent human being. Young; mini-me stares back, and imperceptibly nods his tiny fucking mini-me head, he would approve. I blink a few times to clear my dry eyes, the fog lifts, I click buy.
I get off my phone and back to work, toiling at the earth. A mere peasant, a beast of burden among a flock of the like. Dreams of rising from the ashes of normality, and the drudgery of my peasant life on the backs of glistening clouds of silver block chain, and gusting green winds of gains fill my head as I work my young yet worn body under the whip of the soulless, godless, heathen MAN. Shifts up, no time for dinner, I need sleep.
                             -Chapter Two- ;(
5:00 A.M in the pre-dawn hours of November 30th, 2017, I wake to the sound of my alarm beeping softly from the makeshift plywood table beside my bed. I am not a morning person, mornings for me consist of profuse swearing and ample amounts of coffee. After abusing my coworkers for an hour or so, I generally reach some semblance of a living albeit pissed organism; but today is different. Before I even take a moment to wipe the still moist drool from my freshly parched lips I reach for the still screeching alarm quickly silencing it.
In the night I had dreamt of fields of flowing flowers tipped with dollar bills, budding silver LiteCoins hanging from the bows of dogwoods, and Hillary Clinton being sold into Chattel-slavery as a personnal gift from the God Emperor himself. 
Upon entering the simple pin, I could hardly believe my eyes. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!?!?!?!? My hereditary state of grogginess immediately disappears as I see the previously beautiful including lines and crisp 1080p green numbers have some how been dyed a terrifying hue one could describe in no other term than a deep, crimson. I blink, I blink again, I BLINK REALLY REALLY REEEEEEALLY FUCKING HARD, yet the current status changes not. I pause, puckering my lips as I do basic mathematical calculations to decide if I should start whoring myself out to the local population at 20 bucks a pop, after all, they tell me I'm cute ����. After realising that:
A. CoinBase is down for maintenance (fuck you btw, I'll burn your fucking building down cock suckers)
And B. Selling my anal virginity isn't cost effective once you calculate therapy costs.
I decided the best option would be to get myself blown up by some local dick head so I can claim DBA. So here I am, asking random Afghans if they "shuma infejar maykhwahayde" (you have  bomb?) In the hopes that one will be "yep" and choose me as the lucky recipient of whatever fucking shrapnel he's packing.
Ahhh, also I'm now officially a hodler, because I would in all honestly rather sell bone marrow, or volunteer to test the effects of shared needles between crack heads and non-crack heads than willingly give up my shiny (cursed) LTC. 
Overall I'd have to give this ride a solid 10/10, would wait 8 mother fucking hours longer next time before the universe fist fucks me into a Hispanic, donkey show look-a-like.

Bonuses and paid vacations make it more than worth it. Not many 24 year olds make 107k/year :/
