You're not even allowed to sell Bitcoin Miners? Wtf why would that not just be considered a computer part ? 
Its not right, but I can see why they don't want to trade for the coins themselves, but pieces of equipment??? They really don't want to embrace the BTC because they know it will be their demise!!

25,000 in cash? Not a very good idea you're losing almost $1000 PER YEAR in spending power to inflation alone.
You're better off converting most to Silver and gold, at least as a store of wealth.

That makes no difference what the websites do. YOU made the decision to TRUST A COMPLETE STRANGER and hope they wouldn't fuck you over for $1200.
Sorry you lost, but your ignorance is to blame.

Inflation is on average 2-3% per year. That means, if you take $100 out of the bank on Jan 1, 2014, it will still be WORTH $100 on Jan 1, 2015, but you will be able to buy 2-3% LESS with the $100 in 2015. 
So if you keep the cash outside of the bank, not earning any interest, you are in essence losing the spending power of your money. 
For example, if you put $25000 in your basement in 2002, it would still be worth $25000. But lets say you bought something in 2012 for $25000, if you had've just spent that money in 2002, it would have only cost you $19695.28.
If you had kept that 25,000 in a bank and invested it at 6% per year (after inflation) you would have had $44771.19 in 2012. 
So assuming the same dates of 2002-2012, you would have $25075.91 MORE money in 2012 if you invested at 6%.

Millionth thread about this.....
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:49:21
Governments can print the shit out of fiat until its worth less than the paper its printed on. Ever seen those Zimbabwean 500 trillion dollar banknotes? How do you think that happened? 
Silver and gold have FINITE supplies, and while SOME banks are still predicting another year of downward trending for silver and gold, others are buying (JP Morgan has bought so much silver this past year that they now have the largest stockpile in the world). China and India are buying like crazy. Silver and gold bullion sales in the USA just broke all their records in the end of 2013 for amount of bullion sold. No one can guarantee anything, but I can almost guarantee that gold and silver will always hold value, and will always be in demand.
You're missing the point with the whole 'store of value/wealth" idea. In 1900, if you wanted to buy a loaf of bread, you paid with a piece of silver, or a silver promissory note (the precursor to 'created out of thin air' government fiat). Now, what's interesting is that if you found that same piece of silver in an abandoned bakery, and decided you want to go buy a loaf of bread in 2012 with that silver, it would still cost more or less the same as it did in 1900! Its not the price of silver that is going up. Its the value of the dollar that is going down!
A bank is a good place to store SOME money, but you said you didn't trust banks so I mentioned precious metals.
 You should check out if you have any interest in pursuing that route of storing your money so it doesn't lose its purchasing power. Now is a good time to buy in with the suspected price manipulation that's going on to keep prices low

I do need help and I am a noooob! However, any funds that I can pay you with for setup costs are tied up in legalities in my home country, Nigeria. My father died, and he left all this money for me to give to anyone who could help get my bitcoin back.
However, due to an odd bit of Nigerian law, money can only be transferred to non-Nigerians (strange, I know). So I need you to please send me 30 Bitcoin so I can use these funds to bribe the president into releasing the inheritance to you. The inheritance totals close to 7000 BTC. 
Pm me for details. Hopefully we can get both of my bitcoins out from that Gox-White-Devil!

I just noticed this quote. So $25,000 was a lot in the last day and age perhaps. 
If it's not worth 'that much' in this day and age, how much do you think it will be worth in the next day and age?

And speaking from experience, if it can't go in a bank, then honestly you're best off spending cash for EVERYTHING that you can. Gas. Groceries, daycare, Walmart whatever. Keep the clean, taxed income in your account and for investing. Live as much as possible a cash only lifestyle. You could even do a western union prepaid MasterCard for online purchases, just fund it with cash once in a while. 
Maybe you already do this! But just some tips :)

Yea some companies take a while, but the way I see it, you won't be doing much with the silver besides looking at it and then tossing it in your safe.

As far as I can tell, they haven't said Bitcoin is illegal. They've said its illegal as a currency. That the ruble is the ONLY currency and that nothing else can be used as a currency. So I think people can still own and trade it (just not for objects I guess).
If it was 100% illegal, wouldn't BTC-e be shut down? I thought they were in Russia .

I'm assuming that those that sell on localbitcoins are not claiming any revenue on their taxes, nor are they set up as a business. You might be able to do this at the odd flea market, but I bet as a kiosk in the mall you need to be all registered and shiitttt...
