Also the simply fact is most people actually don't like responsibility and being in control of all your own wealth is scary for most.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:29:14
bit fucking weird, sorry very fucking weird
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:21:43
Why would you get paid in BTC, just buy bitcoin with cash?
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:44:07


You can't avoid it mate.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:19:19
"I don't give a fuck" shouldn't be a mentality when money is on the line.
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:49:07
Its myspace, it will grow, but facebook will takeover. Social media grew and found a king, so will crypto, bitcoin isn't that king

You switch the PC off?

I finally got my money back, coinbase isnt a scam, just slow as fuck
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:27:55
Being able to sell at the peak and buy at the lows is the best method? Wow, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:56:26
Just as an example They could move it into another coin that they pre bought into.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:00:58
I'm referring to the daily posts like this, where people who have no money are throwing it all in to bitcoin. $50 in bitcoin is just going to do nothing for you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:58
At this point i'm not even pissed I missed out on another 100% gain over the past 3 days, I'm pissed they simply don't give a fuck about your money. Seriously, yes bitcoin is going up and whoopie, that's great but you need FIAT to live and these sites aren't letting people cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:44:22
They are shite. Been tweeting for days, emailing for days, multiple hundreds on twitter every day asking for help, they ignore it. They aren't letting people cash out
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:12:16
I'm saying the people putting every bit of spare cash into bitcoin are idiots.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:36:46
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:58:01
Every time I go to purchase something uneeded, I buy BTC. I was going to spend £100 on skins in a game and decided fuck it, BTC. It's not much, I barely have anything but hey, it's fun watching it rise and fall. Now if only the UK had an exchange!
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:59:37
uk so can't, need to go through like 30 transactions and all the fees eat profits, its why I'm out of the bitcoin world
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:05:58
Most people cannot simply afford it. That's it, we all know it's cheap right now but we can't just drop 100,000 into bitcoin even if we know in 5 years it will make us a millionaire. You still need large amounts of cash to snowball.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:55:31
Not jealous at all mate. I'm pleased for you, we are in the same community and you are doing well for yourself, couldn't be happier for you. Just don't go telling people you can make money that easily, when the reality is you hit the jackpot. The average joe can't just drop enough to get 3-4 bitcoins and get the "coin" rolling so to speak.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:45:36
The wiser choice would be to just stop smoking and not gamble on a coin. But this sub just circle jerks
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:59:55
That's not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:00:16
that's what I mean, everyone is talking about "the moon", but the moon doesn't mean shit unless you have atleast 30k into it now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:39:41
Who cares how high it rises when companys won't let you get your money. Fuck coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:51:47
If I hadn't sold through coinbase I would actually have my money and be able to buy back in. However they never respond to support tickets 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:12:23
I have yet to see anyone "average" or anyone that didn't get in super early make serious cash. It's a coin for the rich.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:52:35


That is true.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:45:30
I mean that's great but it's also a circle jerk. Yes if you bought 6 bitcoins cheap you have a lot of money now, just like if you bought any rising stock cheap and held through the rise you have money.
People are acting like this is the only way to make cash AND ontop of that that people can walk in and make 20k, they can't.
You aren't getting rich unless you hit another 50x coin or pump a lot into bitcoin and loan and hold.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:52:18
So I have to open a whole new bank?
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:58:10
Rich would be being able to make 200k + You can't really do that with bitcoin unless you are putting in a LOT of cash, which is super risky and only the rich can afford to do that
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:37:16
You don't want to boost your $ amount, you want to boost the amount of coin you have. Having $500 in bitcoin and 0.5 is nice, but I'd rather have 0.7 and $10 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:34:43
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:48:18
put in $50 dollars now and it becomes a 100k coin, you still haven't made much
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:42:15
Yes, but they didn't just not respond and not help their customers. Coinbase are just going offline conveniently at dips and peaks and refusing to let people cash out. My buying works perfectly suprise suprise, my SEPA, withdraw or anything else isn't. It sucks. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:36:50
Which is why I'm highlighting that it isn't the get rich quick thing people think it is, that moment has gone 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:00:19
Also a good idea not to leave your address online with an account tied your bitcoin, where we can see the chain moves.
Edit - Removed his address but it was there.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:09:40
I thought 7k was too late.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:45:48
Without sites like this, people wouldn't be buying.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:03:06
Because I control when I take my money in and out, not them. Stop supporting them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:00:44
I'm already verified, I need to change my name which apparently means verify again. It's not tell me I failed, it's not saying anything, it's just been this green bar for 3 days, it's driving me insane, I need that money soon
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:46:50
Lost thousands in coinbase, money never gets moved its just sat there. sad, and I cant do shit about it as Im in the uk
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:03:54
I'm not subscribed. Also, what else can you see in that crystal ball. If you think putting $50 in bitcoin in 2017 is going to net you life changing money you are deluded man.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:17:36
I'm quite confident I know what it's more, but the goal posts shifted, it's more Bitcoin as a Store of Value then what it used to be.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:17:18


All the banks in my town have closed already
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:57:17
How do you work that out?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:36:42
Right it was harder for you so it's ok for a company, one of the major leaders in buying and selling bitcoin to just shaft its customers because "HODL" and "Moon" memes. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:56
I've lost 3 grand, that makes me feeling good at christmas to pure shite and you know what? 3K is nothing to some of the transactions I have seen them "lose". It's time to raise awarness that until proven otherwise, their site is a scam
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:41:45
It's annoying that I have to use it to get my money off coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:04:42
because it could go tits up at any moment. Myspace was THE Social media, doesn't mean it was the final form, facebook was? (is). Bitcoin might rise, doesn't mean it stops there.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:02:01
What I mean is, Nokia were "the phone", what people thought of when they thought of mobiles. Now it's apple... coming into Samsung.
Crypto currency has just been "discovered", it doesn't make it the final perfect version
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:20:25
Nope.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:38:37
Yeah that's a decent amount. I'm currently $500 in Bitcoin and $100 in Ethereum, I'm basically trying to make enough to learn to drive, What would do? I find it hard to day trade on GDAX as i'm UK so can't just transfer to bank after so I'm in coinbase where fees make trading hard IMO
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:10:41
I think most families would consider themselves a lot richer if an asset suddenly made them 200k
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:38:13
Bitcoin is a stock, you can't get rich buying tiny amounts, regardless of price and rise. Everyone on reddit and Youtube is like "put £100 in and get rich" but it doesn't work that way.
If you put £100 in now, and it rose to 100K a coin, you haven't really made any life changing money. Bitcoin is so circle jerk right now. YES people got quick cash because they bought early, lend a lot and also hold a decent amount, but no regular joe is getting rich.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:53:42
Every youtube video I see, article and spokesperson seems to refer to this "If you bought £100 you would have 10million!" etc and it plants a seed in their mind, don't miss out.
Use my referral link, sign up here. Loan it out, do this, thats what I did and I'm rich. But that style of trading only works when you have actual decent money to play with, you can't do shit with sub 5k really. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:55:21
You are a moron. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:56:53
Ofcourse it's a good investment, but the type of person that only has 1-1000 dollars to play around with isn't the type of person that is realistically going to be able to sit there with 8 grand in a coin that could die, they need that cash. I just think people are SO overhyped.
If I bought amazon stocks at day one at 20 dollars and chucked in 500, it's now worth 1k, I'd have 25,000. Bitcoin isn't the only think to ever shoot up. People need to be smart with their money because this is no longer a "get rich quick scheme", unless you have some serious money to throw around, lend, trade, trade and lend again
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:02:26
yeah man, you and a few redditors are going to change the value of bitcoin lmao
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:58:11
How much is your investment if you don't mind me asking. For me mine is so small that even if it did rise massively it wouldn't really do much, so I'd be tempted to just take a profit and enjoy the returns 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:16:22
225 upvotes, shows you who is typing and upvoting in this sub. Yes I see the irony
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:59:05


We don't know that, you are effectively gambling a % of FIAT every paycheck
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:31:33
What a fucking idiotic thing to be a part of. Getting killed over a pair of jeans
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:22:37
It's a good website, pure shit for trading. I haven't had access for like a week in the peak moments.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:18:39
"You can't really do that with bitcoin unless you are putting in a LOT of cash, " 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:47:38
I don't have nearly enough to worry about that, I wish I did!
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:09:17
which is pure luck really, all stocks are unless you are really invested into learning and trading
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:50:30
if you are US, you will be ok, EU is screwed 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:02:19
If a website doesn't let it's user cash out what do you call that site? They don't respond to any emails, tickets, nothing. There is a difference between being over run and ignoring customers. You only need to check twitter replies to see I'm not the only one. Until I see change, coinbase will be on my "no" list and I will advise nobody to ever use that site.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:36:37


Basically everyone is circle jerking that you can make it big off bitcoin, but you can't unless you got in super early or put a lot in
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:20:02
Putting your entire life savings and making 10% over 2 years is apparently "gains". Can see why people are being suckered into this, especially poor people. Ripe for scams
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:11:23
No I'm actually not mate. Judging by your post history you are the issue.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:49:26
Regardless of what site it is, they all have withdraw issues.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:17:00


lol, no.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:23:59
Yup, I looked in the early years and thought, I'd like a go but dont have 1,000. Didn't know I could even just put lunch money in and let it see there
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:09
I should have took it out knowing there was going to be a lot of people selling, and then bought back in, Basic mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:11:04
I haven't made shit and probably won't. $500 investment and it fluctuates so badly, that and I can't get a straight answer on wallets / GDAX so coinbase charges me. I'd love to "day trade" with maker fees, BUT GDAX doesn't seem to let you cash out to the bank in the UK
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:17
Bought a £8000 and two minutes laters boom, £5000. fuck gg.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:53:51
I think it's over and we about to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:52:52
Don't think you can do GDAX to coinbase or GDAX to GBP
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:41
Every damn time you wanna jump in and buy cheap the thing is crashed. Couldn't even sel..
