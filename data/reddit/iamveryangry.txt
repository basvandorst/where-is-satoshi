TO ANYONE WHO HAS AN ACCOUNT AT MT. GOX : 
Simon claims that a lawyer of Mt Gox is working with him to clear out the situation.
If you have an account there, could you ask Mt. Gox staff if this is true or not?
This should be enough to advance on this situation.

I will wait until FRIDAY, if this isn't sorted OUT I am with you, if you have any valuable information please share it with everyone, he will have to discuss with us NOT THROUGH internet but IN THE REAL WORLD.
I live near Germany and Bremen is 800km away from me, there's NO PROBLEM for me to take my car and meet him for REAL.
THIS IS HIS FACEBOOK ACCOUNT : 
Everyone store pictures of him on your computer, with this we will be able to find out where he lives.

I AM VERY ANGRY!!!
I have over 500 BTC on BTC-24.
SIMON, STOP LYING TO US, GIVE US BACK OUR BITCOINS!
No bank account store bitcoins, so WHY IS IT A PROBLEM to give back our bitcoins?
Whether they closed your account or not doesn't change anything, YOU still have the bitcoins and YOU still can give them back.
You are HOLDING THEM UP!
I WANT MY BITCOINS NOW!
If someone knows where this guy LIVES tell me his entire address, contact number, I will personally visit him (I live next to germany so it's not a problem!) and YOU will have to refund me every single bitcoin I have on my balance!
This is OUR money not YOURS.
YOU can give us back OUR bitcoins, YOU know YOU can, why are you not doing so? WHY ARE YOU NOT ALLOWING BITCOIN WITHDRAWALS?
YELL OUT SCAM!!!! He is trying to run away with your money!
The only people that should be concerned by this story are those who sent wire transfers to his account, NOT PEOPLE WHO HOLD BITCOINS!
YOU BETTER CLEAR THIS SITUATION UP RIGHT NOW, I WILL NOT BE PATIENT!!!
DON'T THINK YOU CAN RUN AWAY!!

NEWS FROM YELLOWCOIN!!!
There is a large thread at bitcoin.de for those that are fluent in german:
 
 
The summary is:
 
-Someone has called the Police in Bremen: The police confirmed that there is an investigation but they don't know about frozen bank accounts and the person responsible for the case is back next week.
-More information is available for those who file charges with the german police. This is possible from any branch, not just the one in Bremen.

You'd need to ask that to an admin from this forum, does anyone know the admins?
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:02:29
UPDATE : He is ONLINE again!!!
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:38:02
What the hell, this isn't a rumor but one of the official documents he dumped on the BTC 24 website!
Why do you think he is NOT allowing us to withdraw our bitcoins? BECAUSE HE CANNOT PAY US!! 
Are you going to wait 3 months or that he magically restores the website or are you going to make something about it?

There's NOTHING emotional here, I haven't been sleeping for days, I am waiting DAY AND DAY for my bitcoins to be given back NOW.
And UNTIL proven wrong there are several FACTS about this situation : 
1. SIMON gives most of his updates through various forums AND NOT his website which is what he should have done!!
And why did he switch from Reddit to BTC24 HELP? If he isn't a SCAMMER he acts like one!
2. SIMON is either trying to let it rot or is very bad at communicating with people, his answers are just incoherent, he doesn't answer properly and is trying to make it as vague as possible, again a typical scammer attitude!
3. SIMON promised us a BTC withdrawal page 3 days ago, it should have been up YESTERDAY, where is it? WHERE IS THE DAMN PAGE?
4. SIMON knows that if the problem is ONLY with his bank account that he CAN and MUST give us back our BTC that are in no way involved with his polish/german banks!
