No one wants to accept PayPal payments for Bitcoin because they can easily be reversed.

Strange that they would care about people paying taxes as banks have never been bothered about this.
Sounds like an excuse to steal coins while the price is high

This is small change for Kraken.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:19:03
5k or 6k is possible short term but the end of the year I believe 20k
The stock market is booming at the moment but is due for a crash when this crash happens there will be another Bitcoin bull market.

Have you spoke to the bank? Maybe they need the customer to verify the transaction is ok.
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:01:47
What’s the reason?
Have you spoke to your bank about recalling the payment? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:24:43
The way a recall works is your bank will contact the receivers bank and request the payment is refunded but the account holder would need to agree.

Believe me now?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:18:41

Do sportsbet.io actually accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-01 19:26:39
Stops US pressure, the majority of offshore banks also don’t accept US customers.
