I'm not debating the difference segwit makes, wich is in fact "night and day". I'm saying that segwit was launched on Block 481,824. That is 4 months ago, and yet still we see only 10% of all transactions currently use segwit. So mass adoption didnt take of for segwit, not even after 4 months. LN requires even more effort from the client/user side of things, wich makes me question your claim of mass adoption.

LTC is gaining more percent then bitcoin last couple days. If this trend continues, keeping your money in LTC will net you the most gains

I dislike the guy but calling it 'unforgivable'? Rapeing and abusing your own child is unforgivable. Calling someone out on a crypto-political issue is just being a dick
