Me and my friends are sitting here laughing at the dip, hoping it will hit 75 this weekend? Buy orders at 85/80/75

SR exchange rate will always be a little behind. If you are talking about buying BTC, just be ready to buy on the SR when they get to you. 
If you are talking about buying items with your BTC, buying high is great! if you wake up and it has dropped 30, you will still get your order and not have to pay any extra!
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:21:32
Thought they were going to worship it or something... Damn interpretable titles.
@_date: 2013-06-20 04:29:42
From the sounds of it it is not anonymous though like the previous options
@_date: 2013-06-25 03:56:06
Lol didn't know i was speaking actual economics... thanks for the clarification. 
Ex. I meant the efficiency of my dollar, not the "market"

I get what your saying. a traced BTC is a different product than a non traced BTC. Unfortunatly, when you spend them on a pizza or whatever, they are both worth the accepted market value for an exchange bought bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:14:11
135 is 30%+ above market price.
@_date: 2013-03-26 04:03:58
Cavirtex works very well, and their customer service has been great so far. Little bit much on the fees but whatever. CanadianBitcoins works amazingly, and within an hour or two but 99% of the time is waay above market.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:41:05
That makes sense, unfortunately a 30% markup on a financial transaction is well... absurd.
@_date: 2013-06-24 19:10:07
wow thats bizarre, we actually have different memos. one sec ill get a pic too.
edit: not sure how to link a screenshot but anyway when i click on that "New Cash Procedures - click here" it gives me this memo:
1)We have new methods to deposit cash that will be integrated into our site shortly: 1) Cash Bill Payments (CASH VERIFICATION STATUS REQUIRED) and 2) Wire Transfers (Details coming soon). Until the cash updates go live on the site, here is how you can deposit cash today through the first method: Make a bill payment in CASH to your TAYPE account number (found on the account verification screen) at the following locations: MoneyMart (InstaCheques in Quebec), RBC, BMO, CIBC, President's Choice, National Bank, Desjardins, HSBC, CentralOne credit unions(phone yours to ask if they are part of CentralOne for Bill Payments) and ATB (Alberta Treasury Branchs). First e-mail admin with your username and the amount you want to deposit, then go to one of these locations and tell the bank teller "I want to make a BILL PAYMENT in cash to TAYPE International Business Services" and give them your TAYPE account number. You do not need to include the cents portion in your bill payment like cash deposits used to require. Some banks/tellers may require an invoice, this will be available through our site with the update. The wait time is 1-3 business day for this method. We are also considering other cash options that will be announced in the coming weeks. Money Mart will charge $1.99 for this service, banks may or may not charge for this service, depending on whether you have an account with them or not.

You know what i hear? TIME TO BUY.
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:35:45
Only lesson i learnt from this drop(aside from hold!) is to enable myself to buy bitcoins when banks are closed. Wanted to buy so badly.
@_date: 2013-08-16 01:32:04
You wear your watch really high up on your arm. 
Cool idea though!
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:48:16
Didn't realize all the economics majors were gonna come jump on me here,   whatever the term is, if you were to go find the first store you can that accepts BTC they would use the mt gox rate most likely. I am calling that the accepted value of a Bitcoin. 
You are correct though, i should have said " Buying BTC anonymously is officially not possible in Canada *efficiently*"
@_date: 2013-04-25 01:46:03
I lent my best friend 2k the year I graduated high school, I don't regret it at all but to this day he hasn't paid any bak and I end up having to bother him about it.
Don't regret it, but wouldn't do it again. Lending money to friends just isn't a good idea.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:28:09
Most markets are 100-105 right now, so that is what i will refer to ask market price. AS WOULD EVERYBODY ELSE.
Perform arbitrage? 
Not only have you missed the point of this thread but seem to skip over the fact that people are having trouble BUYING btc. 
I feel like i am being trolled. Am done.
@_date: 2013-04-21 05:33:28
Again, you missed the point.
Whether he is a financial burden or not, his parents should not be asking him for money he earned himself. Even if they have spent 100 Billion on him, he doesn't owe them a dime. If anything, he "owes" them 1 successful child. By successful, i mean happy.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:00:52
Atleast u guys know what you bought in at... My spreadsheet file got lost and now I have no idea!!! Bought everywhere from 30-180. Luckily cashed out some at 260. I'm going to hold because if I sell I'm going to be mad at myself whether it goes up or down. Count me in!
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:28:23
What? The market price atm is ~100, 135 is ~30% above market price.


Makes no sense. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:23:27
You are right, but the open trades usually do follow the posted price within 2-3 trades. Also, i have never posted a buy order that didn't get filled at market price within 2-3 hours. 
Thanks for the input, i will keep checking both.
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:56:07
Will do, the low fee looks nice but the market price(right now anyway) is a good 6 dollars above Virtex. Will keep track of it tho
@_date: 2013-06-24 19:08:18
It may not be actually a 30% markup, but buying a bitcoin at 135 and only being able to spend the bitcoin at a value of 100 is ridiculously inefficient.
I guess i should have used "standard accepted value" or something instead of market price,
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:37:28
will try this, do you find any issue when you don't have any trades on your account?
@_date: 2013-07-17 06:20:00
I haven't, and I won't until I see some positive reviews and some legitimacy proof. Thanks for the headsup, i don't plan on being the BTC victim.
@_date: 2013-10-29 05:18:42
Maybe honestly, we don't really talk so it could just be him wanting me to come over. Either way, i'm going to take the opportunity to make a solid impression. 
Ill probably learn some stuff too so bonus.
@_date: 2013-03-26 13:55:33
Just called asking a question, they were nice.
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:52:19
So what changed then? my deposit used to be in next day, if not later the same day.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:09:39
What about online wallets? I have wallets that i do use to store coins sometimes that are backed up, but the vast, vast majority of my BTC are on online accounts. is this unsafe?(both places have a backup wallet address in case of)
@_date: 2013-06-22 03:57:20
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:56:11
Dipped* 
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:55:16
I did too, but only have ~2 BTC left unfortunatly! :[
@_date: 2013-07-13 16:44:06
Is BMO Harris the same as BMO? Other than that, i don't see any Canadian banks.
@_date: 2013-07-07 00:55:29
This was funny to read. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:40:16
I saw that, but I took it with about a million grains of salt
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:12:20
I would be surprised if Satoshi didn't have a huge wealth of BTC too that he mined at the very start, possibly solo?
Who knows tho, just speculation :p
@_date: 2013-04-21 04:23:34
Im sorry that you interpret this story that way.
If the world works like that, you have a pretty damn big debt to pay off to your parents and should probably not spend it on a computer to go on reddit with. (Assuming here, maybe your parents live off of you now, who knows)
I am sure that if OP's parents were in severe financial trouble, he would help out as best he could. 
Parents raise a kid to make there own decisions and choices. Hoping that they make the right one and enjoy it, or make the wrong one and learn from it. If OP did something for himself and made himself a few bucks, the parents should be glad that his decision panned out and let him enjoy it.
Of course, everyhthing is situational. I have no idea how much money you actually made, how old you are, if the money you invested was actually yours, or if the money you consider "yours" is actually yours. If my 17 yr old made 300k off of BTC i would probably have to step in. Even then, stepping in would mean making sure they were responsible with it. Not taking it.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:23:11
Just deposited 500 more bucks than i had put aside for BTC just to buy in this dip.
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:41:12
Yes you are correct. Unfortunately local bitcoins are rarely @ market, and when you want to buy 40+ BTC its not all thaaaat helpful.
Edit: There is one person selling up to 3 BTC in my city for 135 per. Yay.
@_date: 2013-10-29 03:30:16
Peeerfect, thank you very much!!
Now i need to find something about the benefits/future of BTC. 
My goal here is to get him to add some BTC to his portfolio, his business isn't one that would benefit much from accepting BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:35:26
You missed the first part of the post, one sec.
Edit: 


Maybe i am interpreting this wrong, but i believe it requires cash verification.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:12:31
Canadians, check out [Virtex](
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:44:46
Search function... seriously....
@_date: 2013-10-29 03:29:26
I told him i would give him the info as he "doesn't have time to do research right now". The guy works like 14 hours a day out of his house, i don't blame him for not having time.
@_date: 2013-09-12 12:13:18
Me too actually. Was just wondering If I could transfer some coins and make some free $$.
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:46:07
well... the one i verified has been open about 1 day long. the others have been open for 2-3 months.
@_date: 2013-06-17 14:44:03
Fuck... this really throws a wrench in things.
@_date: 2013-07-13 18:46:20
If that is the case i have no problem trying it for 100 bucks. Will do when i have time(hopefully tomorrow)
@_date: 2013-08-03 01:34:49


BTC is not for you. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:50:12
Maybe i misunderstood their new changes, which way requires no authentication?
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:43:11
Just so you guys know, CanadianBitcoins is below market value right now, and its super fast. I have used them 4-5 times and just deposited another two orders today at BMO. Fast, anonymous, cash only, and they have good customer service
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:28:22
I'm glad I'm not your kids. Rent is reasonable in some situations, not all. If OP is 25 I agree, he should pay rent. Even if he was 30 I would disagree with your black and white viewpoint.
For example: My future kids will be able to stay home free post high school school I they are in school after one year out of high school. If they pay rent, it will be purely to teach monu management and would get the rent back once they were a little further along and could use the money responsibly.
Not a parent but I'm sure any parent/reasonable person could confirm what Im saying.
