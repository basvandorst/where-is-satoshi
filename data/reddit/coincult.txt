After 30 days if the sent bitcoin is not claimed you'll get it back.
Also, since you registered the email that it was sent to, it may be Coinbase has hit their limit with their email provider for the day, try in the morning to get the verification email sent, it will likely go through.

My understanding of the "service" is crystal clear, you're developing a "failsafe" to prevent hackers locating an actual wallet.
Your service will never catch on since most people in bitcoin already know how to protect themselves more efficiently...for free.
Unless you're offering some sort of guarantee which may entice some, but I very seriously doubt it. 
Bitcoin already has too many 3rd parties too close to user wallets, it doesn't need another one. I may be wrong and I'll eat crow if I am but I just don't see this taking off.

Couldn't find a non paywall version, here's the text; 
*Newsweek's flawed attempt to expose a 64-year-old Californian called Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin's mysterious inventor has come at an opportune moment for exponents of the cryptographic currency. It has distracted from a crisis of trust caused by the failure of Mt Gox, the Tokyo Bitcoin exchange.
By rights, Bitcoin's community of enthusiasts, venture capitalists and start-up companies should now be occupied with how it can re-establish credibility after a series of unfortunate events. Instead, much of its energy over the past week has been taken up by fulminating about the magazine's treatment of Mr Nakamoto, who denies being Bitcoin's architect.
Online forums have filled with virulent criticism, and a lot of sexist abuse, of Leah McGrath Goodman, the reporter who found the man she believes (but has not yet proved) is "Satoshi Nakomoto", author of the original Bitcoin paper. Devotees have condemned her attempt to "dox" him - expose his identity - whether or not he is their man.
The hysteria undermines Bitcoin's chances of graduating from a hobbyists' obsession to a mainstream technology. You cannot challenge fiat currencies and disrupt the global payments industry while reacting to any uninvited scrutiny like an adolescent whose parent has opened the bedroom door without knocking. It does not work that way.
I say this as a believer in the potential of cryptographic currencies (whether or not Bitcoin survives) to become cheaper and more efficient means of payment and exchange than banks and card companies provide. As I wrote in a previous column, the technology could also permit the exchange of other types of digital contracts.
Whatever its underlying potential, Bitcoin faces an immediate crisis. As some 15-minute celebrities have found, the only thing worse than too much attention is no attention at all. Unless it can restore its reputation rapidly, the media and consumers will lose interest.
Mt Gox is not the only Bitcoin exchange to have mislaid Bitcoins - several others have suffered from a software loophole known as "transaction malleability" - but it is by far the most serious. It filed for bankruptcy in the US this week, having lost about 745,000 Bitcoins ($472m at yesterday's exchange rate), and still has not clearly explained what happened.
To the aficionado, Bitcoin's credibility remains intact. "There has not been a loss of confidence in the technology, but people are newly cautious about trusting Bitcoin companies," says Edward Felten, professor of computer science at Princeton University.
In the case of other exchanges, and perhaps Mt Gox, Bitcoin payments were settled as intended but hackers then altered identifying information on the transactions to fool exchanges into believing that Bitcoins had not changed hands. Mt Gox, the argument goes, was a victim of its own sloppy online bookkeeping rather than a Bitcoin flaw.
To the average consumer, this is a distinction without a difference. Being able to trust "Bitcoin" as a technology but not to be sure that your own Bitcoins are safe does not mean much. The basic function of a bank is to store its depositors' cash more securely than keeping it under the mattress and if Bitcoin cannot match it, little else matters.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.
&amp;gt; The currency's more reflective supporters recognise this. "I have met a lot of depressed people, even if they did not lose money themselves," says Pamir Gelenbe, a partner of Hummingbird Ventures, one London-based Bitcoin investor. "This is a bad event for the ecosystem."
Fixing it will demand both technological and cultural changes. Mt Gox embodied the slapdash, enthusiast phase of Bitcoin. It was founded as an exchange for trading virtual cards in an online game called Magic: The Gathering (from where the Mt Gox name came). Even after it switched to trading Bitcoins, its software was notoriously flawed and accident-prone.
The $100m of venture capital invested in Bitcoin in the past couple of years (including $25m in Coinbase, the San Francisco-based digital wallet company in December) has brought professionalism and an experienced group of technology executives to the field. They look on Bitcoin more dispassionately than the earliest adopters.
"The recurring theme of Bitcoin is that it is exciting but it has been difficult to find good entrepreneurs. There is a set of guys who got lucky by setting up companies in the early days before it really took off. They were in the right place but were the wrong people," says one venture capitalist.
Some of the new entrants are now trying to fix the flaws that Mt Gox exposed, such as requiring two digital signatures for each transaction (an approach taken by BitGo, a Seattle start-up), rather than letting a hacker who obtains a single signature steal the money. Elliptic, a London-based company, is offering storage of Bitcoins backed by banklike deposit insurance.
Such changes raise the possibility of Bitcoin becoming more expensive as safeguards are added (Elliptic charges 2 per cent for its deposit insurance). Goldman Sachs estimated this week that Bitcoin transfers cost 1 per cent of the amount, compared with 2.5 per cent for Visa-type card payments, and adding costs could erode that edge.
But Bitcoin's backers do not have much choice. As a "crisis strategy draft" that circulated at Mt Gox in its last days put it: "At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, this could be the end of Bitcoin, at least for most of the public." A crisis sometimes makes you grow up fast.

First step, do a search on the computer for a [ wallet.dat ] file, this would indicate he may have bitcoins stored on the computer.
Also, look through his browser history to see what websites he frequented. Be sure not to guess at his password too much since you run the possibility of locking yourself out of the account. 
Contact the places he may have had bitcoin stored, most companies will treat it like any digital asset and possibly assist in recovery if you provide a death certificate and marriage license. Maybe.

You pay for that 'security' in percentage rate. Plus the time you're on the phone disputing charges and having to call in a police report. 
Paying for stuff on credit still doesn't entitle you to the items purchased, if you default or file for bankruptcy you liquidate your assets to pay off the debt. 
I never understand why people think they can rack up charges on their credit and diving deeper into debt because they are under the false pretense of thinking they own the assets they purchase with it...
I prefer to buy stuff in cash or bitcoin, that way I know it's mine and I am not paying more for it down the line because of credit.

Provide a call to action that gets people interested, whether it be providing a starting point to someone new to bitcoin. Also, to further your company, offer anything willing to learn to stop by and talk shop for awhile as long as your superiors are comfortable with it.

You're very correct, and this information needs to be addressed as well to potential adopters of bitcoin who may not know how to secure their bitcoin properly. 
I like your contrasting voice here in r/bitcoin because it raises a valid point that seems to be quickly disregarded.
Bitcoin is a powerful tool that desperately needs instructions for a user to properly use it. 
Another valid point that can be addressed is that banks are closing accounts when they learn it is being used in bitcoin transactions, how does someone address this aspect when telling people that are becoming interested in BTC?
This is just one reason I stray away from telling my friends or family in getting into bitcoin..

After all of the bitcoins are mined, the incentive will transition to being paid in transaction fees.

Anyone can see your transaction and verify it is legitimate, yet there are no open doors to your private information such as identify or financials.

Once every coin has been mined the incentive to keep mining are transaction fees. 
There is no such thing as an impossibility to mining, just an evolution to mining profitability. 
Edit: I shouldn't say there will always be a need for mining, yet a network to sign and verify transactions.

Directly working on it usually takes me around 30-45 minutes since I do already have elements of the design already built such as size and icons. 
I did say hourly since you may want to customize a design in the style of Dorian which can take longer. 
Here is one that I recently completed that is more trustworthy and legitimate. 
If you're looking to get started, I can draft one up by the end of the day today, I don't require payment until I send the final draft.
Basically, describe what you're looking for as far as content and color scheme and I can go from there.

This is exactly what I want to do, I am a seasoned visual communication designer that will work for free on the design as long as I have help knowing what to put that would make sense to a business owner. 
I would really like to see once a business is set up on BTC, to have a information card to give to clients so next time they'll be more incentive to pay with BTC. 
If anyone is interested, I am willing to partner with some one to make this happen, I have full support from the print industry.

FWIW, most companies that are wrapping their vehicles already have employees that use companies cars and wrap their whole fleet. 
The wrap ad service has been attempting, but the metrics of it lends to it being less efficient than using their own company vehicles as wraps usually last 5-7 years. 
Not saying this isn't a good opportunity to promote bitcoin since there's not an official advertising arm for it, but likely you'd be relying on a crowdsourcing type of funding. 
Try approaching BitPay or Coinbase, they'll likely be interested since their business model relies on public awareness of bitcoin.

Simply no because that would essentially require a dispensary owner to register as a second new business just to transact bitcoin and would be paying taxes not only on the pot, but the transactions for bitcoins. 
Edit: No worries on seeing each other's point, but these would be the questions that needed to be answered for a pot shop to consider it.

There is a very small transaction fee that is optional, the higher the fee, the quicker your transaction is verified. Currently transaction fees are very low. 
This does not include fees associated with going through a 3rd party processor such as coinbase or bitpay or other processors, they charge their own fees but you get a premium service out of it.

Lol, nope. I am sure creative managers will come up with any excuse to invalidate bets and take your bitcoins in the process.
* 2.1.8. you understand that Bitcoins are not considered a legal currency or tender and as such on the “Websites” they are treated as virutal funds with no intrinsic value.

No clones, our R&amp;D has concluded that there are too many issues with clones and thus a liability with no warranty. 
Currently the manufacturers we've partnered with are Sigelei, ProVari, Innokin and Joyetec. We would rather rely on manufacture warranty for any customer issues that clones do not provide. 
We are researching in having custom built mechanical mods for 18650 batteries with in-house warranty. 
Personally, I've had horrible service buying clones from vapor shops that are passing them off as legitimate, we refuse to do this.

@_date: 2014-01-08 06:45:38
I agree. 
Plus, if one is secure with handling their coin, it would make them less vulnerable from 3rd party attacks such as skimming, physical theft, and bullshit credit card companies pull. 
Quite a bit of fraud is family and friends screwing a cardholder over, yet we hardly hear about it since it's rarely reported. 
Another thing, bitcoin isn't credit. It's a store of value which is very important in the health of an economy, Traditional or digital. A common echo I hear from financial advisers is to not rely on credit for minor purchases. 
Maybe bitcoin is an excellent form of finance that the current generation understand and will flourish in.

Can it create a vector QR code from a public address?
The most less expensive way that I've found is to follow these steps;
* Shorten your public address at 
* Take the shortened URL and make a QR code at  from the URL you created at payb.tc
* Download either the SVG or EPS is fine as well. 
It's a dirty hack and when people scan the code it will direct to the payb.tc URL which isn't the direct public address but it will work for the least expensive option.

I agree and speculation isn't my intent. All I am saying is if and when bitcoin is more widely accepted to pay for stuff online, then I am all for it. 
Like most here would agree, it's always a risk paying with a debit card online. So much that I personally pay $10 a month just for a prepaid card that allows ACH transfers to act as a buffer between my offline and online transactions.

Ah okay yes, what they need to do is essentially take a raster file (jpeg or png) and convert it into a vector file (AI, CDR or SVG) since vinyl plotters use the mathematical equations to effectively cut out the QR code into vinyl.

Chapter 7, I believe, is when they have assets to liquidate. Chapter 11 is for reorganization at the price of paying back the debts themselves.
So I think you're correct on the Chapter 15 being an avenue for being a foreign company.

Depending on what you ordered, TigerDirect may not be able to  send what you purchased.
I am not sure what is or is not allowed per country since it was early 2000 when I worked for Dell tech support, we weren't allowed to send modems or processors to the middle east or other random countries depending on the hardware.

I personally like to have control of my financials without getting nickle and dimed for the sake of just having money in my bank account. I have to keep one for my mortgage but I chose not to have all of my money in one place. Bitcoin affords me to safely store my funds with the tools available with no fees or any bank peeking into it just to see what I have in there. 
In regards to your question about bitcoin verification, miners do the work of validating a transaction and thus creating a record of transaction on the Blockchain. As far as fraudulence, unfortunately bitcoin doesn't offer you any protection in a direct theft, it's the exact same as if someone broke into your home and robbed valuables and cash yet even in that scenario you're still protected by homeowners insurance. There are ways to keep your bitcoin stash safe. 
Personally, even before bitcoin, I chose to stray away from credit cards just so I eliminate a week point in my financials in regards to theft, fees, unauthorized charges and creating an unnecessary debt. 
I've also been on the merchant side of things and credit card companies are hell dealing with bogus chargebacks and fees associated with cc transactions, these include only visa and mastercard. American Express is an outright robber in fees and hoops you have to jump through. 
Don't get me wrong, I don't hate credit cards and under responsible ownership they are good financial tools at your disposal.

Yes, you're right. Yet that safety is still being paid for by someone. Be it the consumer that's directly affected, consumers as a whole who pay monthly fees, the government, taxpayers... 
Regardless of who pays, someone ultimately does.
Bitcoin is a tool for a person to transact with limited regulation between two parties, if someone misunderstands that tool and the risks associated with it without creating a safe protocol to transact, then maybe BTC isn't for them.

The pack will include; 
• Custom tees with the business BTC QR addy
• Die cut vinyl window decals
• Digitally printed, electronic and vehicle safe decals
• 4' banners to hang on a store front
• information sheets on how bitcoin can help their business
• another information sheet for business to hand out to their customers on the incentive of paying with btc
I am in the printing industry and while I am almost finished with the collateral, I'd love to partner with you to see if we both could benefit in a team environment.

Staff shouldn't know any login credentials to bitcoin financials just the same as bank and credit card information now, Coinbase offers the tools to facilitate these transactions through employees. (Never used BitPay but likely they do as well.)
An idea to provide a seamless pay to pay the bill is to print a traditional receipt with the public address QR code for the customer can scan. You can make a new QR code for each transaction thus building a record of account. 
You can peg your SKUs to USD and your processor will adapt the BTC price accordingly and thus will instantly convert it to USD so there is no loss of value. 
Hopefully this info will help you in your proposal and their decision in accepting BTC.

Sure go ahead and send it to my personal email at elijah.cates
Sounds like you have something solid in mind so feel free to send anything you feel pertinent. 
Do you mind if I use the work in my portfolio and make a posting at coincult.com? 
Here's my work 
I look forward to working with you!

This is where the business to business industry creates a platform for business who accept bitcoin to further invest into their own business with what they are paid with. 
Once there is a solid B2B foundation such as marketing, internet hosting, suppliers, support, and much more then business will have incentive to accept BTC.

Thanks, I'm off for the holidays so my contribution is a small gift to the community, I'll be doing much more as well. :)

I decided to make a graphic for The BEST of Bitcoin. Use it as you wish, no credit needed. 
Edit: Had some time today to whip out a one pager hosted on my site. It really makes the graphic pop.
I apologize for any page loading delay, I am using a free server.

Thanks dillpicklechips, you've given me what I needed and a craving I didn't know I wanted until now. ;)

B2B ventures that promote and service other businesses that are wanting to get into accepting bitcoin. 
When there are suppliers of goods, in my case marketing and design, there will be incentive for business to accept bitcoin if they find an outlet to spend and strengthen the btc economy. 
That's just my take though. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:51:52
Do you agree at the very least that Overstock will be the guinea pig of corporations accepting bitcoin and may be a catalyst to others accepting it?

Pretty much the general sentiment of mining is you'll be profitable if you're selling the asic miners. 
What's going on is the equivalent of buying a shovel for $5000 during the gold rush and waiting 5 months to get it. 
Best way currently to get bitcoin is either buy it directly, sell stuff, or find someone to pay you doing side gigs. 
I've wrestled with the same situation and decided it was best to save my money. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:07:51
I don't know what's more useless, this post or the bitcoin spams that's been going around.

It would've been great to utilize a designer that accepts BTC. 
I try not to participate in crowdsourcing but wanted to show you the clean and simple design I created. 
I recently finished the logo for GoCoin.com and I am interested in pursuing good design in the crypto community. 
Soon, I will have coincult.com running which may transition into a crowdsource for crypto, I can then change the sub domain to bit.coincult.com, lite.coincult.com... etc. 
Anyway, if you are interested in working together I'll gladly accept BTC. As a last resort, I can submit it to 99 designs. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:06:10
From what I've seen, even the largest companies in the industry only pay a percentage in BTC. 
Being paid fully in cryptocoin is not viable right now due to volatility in the market.  Unless, a company steps up to provide payment processing exclusively for coin, then they could lock in the price when converting to fiat similar to BitPay. 
It will be interesting to see if there is validity in payment processing for coin, it could potentially save quite a bit in processing fees, damn near everyone has direct deposit these days.

Be sure the executor of your will understands how to easily transfer the assets to the beneficiary. 
If your estate is a bit larger and needs to go through probate court, you would need clear instruction to be provided so it can be divided equally between multiple beneficiaries. 
Each state can have their own specific rules on the proper way to process the will.
/Not a lawyer, just had to recently go through the process.

I run a small sign shop here in Denver. I have the equipment to do small runs of digitally printed stuff and I've been interested in accepting bitcoin. 
If I present some ideas, with help, I will develop a small catalog of custom bitcoin related print products. 
Should it be okay to work up some creative to show and make a full post of it?
Stuff like t-shirts, vehicle and electronic safe decals - from 2" to 4'. Banners, promo items, die cut vinyl. 
One thing I've been working on is a bitcoin promo packet to distribute to local businesses in a presentable manner that gets the benefit of accepting bitcoin in the most easy way possible.

"Creators post their creations knowing they may not receive a single donation.  Consumers can pay any amount of currency they want, or nothing at all." 
How exactly will anyone be profitable uploading content?
What makes your site better to post content rather than me dealing directly with clients?
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:58:19
I agree with you, I was only stating an observation.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:36:20
I'll help, PM me with details. I've been in the design industry for a decade now and might as well create stuff that I want. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 07:03:24
Yes! 
anyoption.com does, be wary and do some research to see if it's a good fit for you. Currently their bitcoin option isn't available but they're usually closing and opening options when they see fit.

How would they convert to USD when banks do not do business with dispensaries? A dispensary with investors will never allow BTC transfers into a personal bank account.

Unfortunately you're going to have to chalk it up as a valuable life lesson, money management is difficult enough without falling into the trap of gambling.
