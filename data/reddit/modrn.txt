Must be why I got a .01% return today and am averaging a .7% over the last 30 days.

Well considering all of these companies are actually reputable companies that you can feel somewhat comfortable in having your assets stored on their platforms... You should understand it's not as simple as flipping a switch to make sure your entire business platform doesn't fail your customer base when implementing new technologies. 
Shit post that should be down voted in my opinion.

How do you do charting? Tradingview doesn't have gemini as an available exchange and gemini themselves don't have great charts? Just trying to figure out how I can use it comfortably.

How do you chart though?

This isn't a low end Porsche at all and many actually think it's the best driving Porsche ever made. But.. something tells me you don't know much about Porsches.

Didn't Jeff Bezos/Amazon just purchase some mining websites, or something related to crypto as well? Super misinformed question, just heard it through the grapevine.

Last week, Judge Legrome Davis of the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania, affirmed that decision, saying “the coins in question were not lawfully removed from the United States Mint.”
Sounds to me like the Father may have stolen them and that's why they were seized by the government?

Ohh really? I was unaware? Do you happen to have a link that shows their insurance policy? Thanks so much! I do normally use gdax for my BTC purchasing, but I was using bitfinex for altcoin purchasing with USD. Not sure if this is best practice as I know a lot of people purchase other crypto with BTC, I just don't like to get rid of it haha.

Thanks so much man, really appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:03:44
Exactly what I do as well. I was wondering if their are any other preferred exchanges for alt coins now? Thanks for the info!

Well I think the only way BTC goes up if people are buying. It went up because of the holiday craze with regular Joe's buying it. They have now sold off and now we're back where we were.

Ohh it may be! I just thought that as well. Either way, I upvoted because this is a good resource for people.
