Buy at an ATM or local bitcoins and conceal your identity. Then once you have the bitcoin don’t make any transactions which can be linked to your identity. For example, don’t buy a package on a website and have it sent to your address. Also avoid creating transactions from a node which is tied to an IP which may be linked to your identity.

I’m not assuming they would have to use an ATM in their country or that they would use anything besides cash.

Yeah Apple would have no idea. :) I too am quite upset with Apple and their stance on Bitcoin. But iOS is my profession and it's awfully fun.. They'll come around.

The app we build doesn't have to revolve around Bitcoin. You could pay me with Bitcoin to build something completely different, a Flappy Bird clone for example. :)

Money laundering.—The Committee understands that Bitcoins and other forms of peer-to-peer digital currency are a potential means for criminal, terrorist or other illegal organizations and indi- viduals to illegally launder and transfer money. News reports indi- cate that Bitcoins may have been used to help finance the flight and activity of fugitives. The Committee directs the FBI, in con- sultation with the Department and other Federal partners, to pro- vide a briefing no later 120 days after the enactment of this Act on the nature and scale of the risk posed by such ersatz currency, both in financing illegal enterprises and in undermining financial institutions. The briefing should describe the FBI efforts in the con- text of a coordinated Federal response to this challenge, and iden- tify staffing and other resources devoted to this effort.

This decision was made by an algorithm that is going to error on the side of caution. As time goes on, they will iterate on it's implementation and it will make better 'decisions'. No point in getting so upset from the output of a non optimal algorithm.

That country will be a scary place if encryption is banned.

I would suggest avoiding breadwallet. It is severely lacking. Copay is much better, imo. Also I saw that it has hardware wallet support.

I would bet you didn't type the seed exactly as it was shown. I.e. Woman vs Women
