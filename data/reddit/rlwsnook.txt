volume today (a red day) was greater than yesterday (a red day). each red day we see volume increase over the previous red day. I don't think I understand your comment about it tightening, as that's just straight up false.

Again after hours still trades but there are limited participants, thus the after hours moves are not considered as important.

Sideways? If you want to read it wrong you could say it looks like a bull flag, issue is volume is increasing rather than decreasing on down days.

Yes it’s true. Number of buyers is irrelevant but total $$$ buy orders vs sell orders is what matters. Supply vs demand. If more sales than buy orders are placed the price will fall. It’s alarming when the delta of volume goes up on down moves day over day. 
Also if you look at volume on up moves decreasing volume day over day is also alarming. 
These are all shorter term technical trading things. Combined with candle sticks and some other indicators you can gain a pretty good idea of short term moves.

Expect that is exactly the opposite of what's happening. Volume is going through the roof as the price tanks.

there is support at $9k then at the $8.3-$7.7k level. It's not going to go straight to $7k, but if volume keeps accelerating on down moves support won't hold. $7k is a real big level of support. 
I wouldn't be shocked if the market tries to test these levels though.

I have. I do not see a sideways move, I see a pennant flag, but up volume on down days negates that chart pattern. Plus it failed to hold $10,162 today, so we are in a down trend. Support at $9k then $7.7-8.3k then $7k.

trading during market hours is the important time frame. after hours trading is light (not as many participants) and thus not representative of true moves.

Wall street trades from 9:30 am to 4pm.

Waste of time. Last year they said short the pound as brexit would be bad for the GbP. Ignore it.

I see it quite clearly. People freaked out and sold on dates like dec 22nd jan 16, 17th. But on green days like jan 18th-20th the volume in rate of change terms is decreasing. 
This chart is crazy bearish right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:13:46
ps if there are more buyers than sellers the price goes up not down. Trying to break down the volume to the hourly or shorter charts isn't going to help your understanding of whats going on as computers manipulate trading. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:53:11
Technicals show a pretty clear case for $7.7k-$8.3k and then $7k to be tested, if it gets much below that $3k is possible. Getting to $1k would be much harder there is a ton of support from $1-3k. 
Honestly the only real risk is for regulators to step in because companies are running Ponzi schemes.

Is this your first time trading futures? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:15:15
Your time frame is too short. that time frame will show you nothing 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:57:36
I think the next move down will scare a lot of people. that said if it holds around the $7k level it could see a nice bounce.

Almost anyone trading bitcoin who didn't panic sell could have made money. That doesn't mean your process works it means you bought as bitcoin was going up in price. The most dangerous thing in trading is being right for the wrong reason and becoming over confident. GLTY!
