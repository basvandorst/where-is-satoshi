It's never coming. Get off your ass and take your own risks and work for your own coins.

Crypto currencies and corporations should be two separate things. I they aren't then it's not a currency you want to invest it. 
Roger ver does not have a 50% stake or control of bitcoin cash. 
If you label miners by country then China controls bitcoin as well.

none of these people are relevant to big blocks on bitcoin.... If you hate them so much and buy into all the FUD then with your logic big blocks on bitcoin would damage them because it would make bitcoin cash irrelevant. 
Are you even capable of making an argument against big blocks?

wut this is completely irrelevant to what I said. The ripple token is not relevant to their user case. They need the ripple company and their algorithm which is not connected to the ripple crypto currency in any way.....

if you are referring to ripple and similar currencies. They will flourish but the currency itself won't. Ripple has no use to the banks or the corporations they just need it's algorithm. The coin itself is useless.

because bitcoin will still need bigger blocks with the addition of LN to work normally

lmao i've already been invisibly banned. Your post doesn't even show up in the thread. I wonder why they would ban me over my ideas..........
Your argument is purely based off of what you consider using "bitcoin" is. For the average user 99.999% of users they don't need a node and that's how they use bitcoin. For the tiny % that do they can simply run their own node (or get several users to pitch in to make their own uncensored node) rather then harming the entire network for the vast majority of the population 99%+ of users. Currently there hasn't even been node censoring for wallets....
What we are arguing about to begin with is when blocksize become massive.
 If we had 8 mb now users could afford to run a node by simply using the money they saved from not having to pay absurd transaction fees............................

the remainder of the funds would be left on the original address. 
The private key would remain the same, you don't need to export it. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:24:19
no it's not. An average user needs to take multiple steps to use it so it's a terrible solution. A 4 mb block size increase would not force people to create new segwit friendly addresses 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:17:33
There would be no negative effects from 8mb that will lead to centralization. You're falling into major FUD.

posting a blockstream fud chart excellent information. 
Doesn't it hurt decentralization if we increase the block size?
Some argue that by lifting the limit on transaction space, that the cost of validating transactions on individual nodes will increase to the point where people will not be able to run nodes individually, giving way to centralization. This is a false dilemma because at this time there is no proven metric to quantify decentralization; although it has been shown that the current level of decentralization will remain with or without a block size increase. It's a logical fallacy to believe that decentralization only exists when you have people all over the world running full nodes. The reality is that only people with the income to sustain running a full node (even at 1MB) will be doing it. So whether it's 1MB, 2MB, or 4MB, the costs of doing business is negligible for the people who can already do it. If the block size limit is removed, this will also allow for more users worldwide to use and transact introducing the likelihood of having more individual node operators. Decentralization is not a metric, it's a direction. This is a good video describing the direction of how decentralization should look.
Additionally, the effects of increasing the block capacity beyond 1MB has been studied with results showing that up to 4MB is safe and will not hurt decentralization (Cornell paper, PDF). Other papers also show that no block size limit is safe (Peter Rizun, PDF). Lastly, through an informal survey among all top Bitcoin miners, many agreed that a block size increase between 2-4MB is acceptable.

There is no reason to wait for big blocks when they could safely be implanted now and make bitcoin usable again.
