What is the general format of the string? Number of characters? First two letters?
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:50:34
With that many inputs, at current fee levels, you're going to pay nearly 90% of the total btc as a fee if you want it confirmed on the same day. I would strongly suggest just waiting until fees drop to 20-50 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:16:09
Fees are not set by the amount of btc you're moving, but by the amount of space your transaction takes up in a block. You currently have a tx of 33969 bytes, paying about 1 satoshi per byte.
Current fees are around 500 sat/byte for confirmations in the next 10 blocks or so. With your tx size, that comes out to 0.169845 BTC, which is actually more BTC than you have to begin with.
Your only option is to wait until &lt;50 sat/byte transactions are confirming, and send one of those. Even then, you will be paying 0.0169845 BTC for 50 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:10:12
It's likely a 12 word seed phrase + 1 word password
Try  (with the internet diconnected of course) and see if any of the addresses have BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:52:40
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:40:51
Electrum seeds are not BIP39 compatible, I would avoid doing this. Even if it works, you have no guarantee it will function as intended.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:11:44
There are open source, more efficient vanity generators around. `O` is also an illegal character for addresses, try `o`.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:35:12
You can buy a new one, or use other BIP39 compliant wallets to recover using the seed.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:42:46
Where is the BTC address you sent it to from?
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:23:14
It looks like the tx was double spent by kraken. If this one doesn't confirm or disappears from blockchain.info, you should submit a ticket to kraken
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:49:19
No, you were charged a 0.0002195 fee. Your Armory units are likely set to something smaller than BTC
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:16:34
That's more or less never going to confirm in the current mempool. The fee is so low that most nodes won't even broadcast it (as you can see on Blockcypher, with the very low number of mempools it is in).
Which wallet did you sent it from? You may be able to reblace by fee, or double spend.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:23:59
Or just don't commit forgery in general. That works too.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:32:09
Import the key into Mycelium.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:00:47
TX ID?
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:23:24
Hmm. I'm sure about iPhone, don't use it much. You may have some luck with Openssl on Windows/OS X/Linux
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:26:47
Is the transaction confirmed?
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:02:04
Did you send USDT? What's the address?
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:56:13
Yeah, it shouldn't break the ledger, but I would avoid using it as your wallet. You should reset the Ledger and configure as a new device, and use the seed it gives you.
You can then put your Electrum seed into electrum and send the funds over to the Ledger.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:18:06
Sounds like you have an encrypted string. Do you happen to know the password?
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:56:52
No, OP wants to go the other way around. Ledger-&gt;Electrum, all good. Electrum-&gt;Ledger, possibly not all good.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:15:48
This isn't technically a bug, more of a client side thing.
There's no such thing as "creating new accounts". All the accounts already exist on your seed, it is simply a matter of accessing them.
As per [BIP 44]( which defines how the account system works, a client must not allow creation of new accounts if the immediately previous account is unused. This is to allow new clients that import to seed to effectively discover all used accounts, since they can assume that the moment they see an unused one, they have covered all the addresses.
In your case, the unconfirmed BTC2 tx seems to have convinced the Ledger client that it should create a BTC3 account. A fix for this would be to either wait for tx confirmations, or to increase the account discovery limits.
Either way, it's good to know for future users why accounts might suddenly disappear, especially on chains like BTC where txs disappear during high congestion periods.
Do note that at no point was your BTC ever lost. It could have always been recovered by someone accessing the seed and iterating manually.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:38:23
You can make a regular wallet and just import the keys instead of sweeping them (although sweep should also let you specify the to address, which boils down to the same thing)
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:57:04
 &gt; "urgent: alert key compromised, upgrade required." 
The alert key system has been deprecated, you just need a newer Bitcoin-qt.
Your best bet is to open the wallet, run the dumpwallet command under Help-&gt;Debug-&gt;Console, and then import the private keys into something like electrum
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:02:14
Depending on whether you have hardened or unhardened addresses it is possible to derive other keys.
As a general rule, the moment you reuse a seed, reset it, and pretend the old one never existed 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:27:48
It's not technically worthless. It's just that you have 231 inputs, which takes up a huge amount of space to transact. Once (and this may take a while) the fees drop low enough, you will be able to move it for 5-10% of the total amount.
If you wish, I can help you with some optimal input selection so that you burn the least amount of money. Feel free to drop a PM if you want to look into this further.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:58:42
You don't need to do anything to get it back. Just leave your Bitcoin-qt closed so it stops rebroadcasting it each time you open it up.
Once the fees have dropped enough, open it with `zapwallettxes` so that it deletes the unconfirmed transaction, then send it again with a higher fee.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:19:02
They do, for the overall tx size. But your per byte fee is high enough, and it will scale linearly with the number of inputs.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:09:51
That transaction doesn't exist
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:54:23
If you sent it to a coinbase address linked to your account, they will show up in coinbase.
You can view all the deposit addresses generated by coinbase at 
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:45:38
Lol no. This is completely incorrect.
Most likely, you changed the fee on the ledger tx then didn't click max again, so you ended up with a small change output. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:07:40
It has a 100sat/byte+ fee, it should confirm in the next couple of blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:16:59
Try this one, for instance 
Case in point, feel free to drop a tip at `1hoLDEZU9d1tit9PRx3WEn44g2yFDQmmU` or `1Lamboyj2WhpgBf7eAZK7QF3ERxHrpP23k` if you think the advice helped :P
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:36:43
Electrum, make sure you get the newest version.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:53:05
Electrum supports it, but the seeds generated by Electrum are not BIP39 by default. Ledger is purely BIP39. Using a regular electrum seed on your Ledger is not likely to end up going well.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:41:17
It's possible that the node mycelium is connected to simply didn't see it due to the low fee
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:23:45
Ideally, don't commit forgery when you have a relatively fast, legal way out of it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:10:04
Did you ever import individual keys into the Mycelium app?
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:40:56
You likely have a lot of inputs, not much you can do to get around that, unless you also have larger inputs that you can spend.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:42:07
You can use openssl to directly decrypt the wallet.aes.json, just run it repeatedly with different combinations 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:41:48
You don't. Coinbase is a hosted wallet, they don't share keys.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:56:26
Well, that's almost never going to confirm.
Ideally, you should be spending that output to create a child pays for parent, with a much higher fee.
I've just rebroadcasted it from a couple of my nodes, do you see it on the ledger now?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:37:16
What's the file name?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:03:34
No wallet uses 60 words
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:14:28
rescan is a start up option, you need to pass it as part of the launch command. It can't be run inside 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:57:26
ah, definitely 24 words then.
There is no reset to the 3 attempts. You get them wrong in a row, it wipes, even if they're spaced out by months
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:21:11
The money is recoverable, provided Coinbase cooperates. They can use the private key to access the coins on the other chain. You should reach out to them and ask them to help you.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:42:37
He has received the money.
Either his wallet is not syncing, or he doesn't know how to use Bitcoin, or he's just straight up lying.
In all three scenarios, he has received the money.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:44:08
I'm guessing `1A21RF5RwZCEV7puBG3drKdHMCJ6mrnDgR` is a change address in your own wallet. Simply send the 0.4X BTC from that address to yourself, much with a much higher fee. You will create a child pays for parent tx chain.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:48:01
What is your launch command/bitcoin.conf file?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:58:17
1. Open port 3001 in your AWS security group, it's closed by default
2. Open ` in the browser
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:35:05
Ledger will give you a new address each time you use it.
Look up the transaction IDs from your Ledger and see if your balance across all transactions tallies up.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:09:50
Click on your btc account, then account settings. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:20:33
In a terminal or command line. You may need to install openssl.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:40:30
It seems to be trusted so far, but I wouldn't use it for the sole reason that they retain control of one of your private keys for the address, making it impossible to claim any forked coins, or recover your own coins if they go down if you forgot to email yourself the presigned transactions/they went down before sending you the presigned transactions.
Get a hardware wallet if you're dealing with large amounts of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:53:43
You'll need openssl installed for this, then you can run the following:
`openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in encryptedfilename -out decrypted.txt`
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:19:02
That's the poloniex omni layer hot wallet. It isn't spamming the network, it is processing user withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:58:37
Just don't use brainwallets. We already have better schemes to generate addresses, such as HD wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:44:50
As always, even if you trust the site, generate the wallets offline, review the code to make sure you're getting legitimately new keys, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:32:15
Ledger uses segwit addresses. The address you sent from is segwit. One of the outputs is not, but one is. Therefore, it's likely that the larger address came back to your Ledger.
You should be able to spend an unconfirmed input from the Ledger. If it's not showing up, try restarting the app. If it still doesn't work, there may be some issue with an upstream node.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:02:00
This guide will only (broadly) work for segwit addresses, not multisigs or other P2SH addresses. There's a more comprehensive guide for the segwit recovery on but I usually ask people to PM me so that I can give them specific addresses to the exact address they have (Electrum 2fa wallets, for instance, are another commonly sent to address, and are multisigs) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:00:13
You don't need to download the entire chain - You can disconnect after downloading Bitcoin-qt, and do the rest offline. 
Once you have the keys, you can move them into an online wallet such as Electrum or Mycelium.
Feel free to drop me a PM if you need help at any point.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:44:51
Your Bitcoin are not lost. If the tx was dropped, it will return to Bitcoin Core. If not, it will eventually show up in Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:13:23
Do you have the wallet backup file?
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:23:12
Possibly, but unlikely. Having half the seed missing makes it too computationally difficult to really brute force it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:32:43
How old is your ledger? 12 word phrases are still valid, but I don't recall ledger ever using them
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:00:09
If you still have the wallet.dat file, you can likely recover them. PM me if you need any help, I specialise in coin recovery.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:12:57
I'm afraid I've never reached out to them before, so I'm not sure of what their response time looks like.
You can also try posting on Bitcointalk. I know some of the miners hang around there
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:40:31
All the coins are linked to the seed, so uninstalling and reinstalling individual apps is safe as long as your seed is not reset

Feel free to drop a PM if you need any help
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:43:55
1. Either one of the transactions is mined and your coins end up where you send them
2. Both transactions are dropped and your coins end up back in Electrum

@_date: 2017-12-10 17:13:55
Your Bitcoin core is somehow picking up your vertcoin core wallet.dat.

Well, okay then. Each to their own ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Feel free to PM it if you're concerned about privacy 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:47:27
1. Do not share the words or file with anyone else
2. Restore the 12 words into a wallet such as Mycelium 
3. The file is encrypted with a password. If you know what the password is, you can decrypt it with openssl. If the file corresponds to the same wallet as the words, you may not need to decrypt it, the words may be enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:46:20
If you have a transaction in your tx history list, copy the hash, and look it up on altcoin explorers until you find it. Try Dogecoin, Litecoin, Vertcoin, Bitcoin Cash, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:09:46
Your bitcoin address (public key) is like a transparent safe. Anyone can look and see what you have in it, but no one can take it.
The private key opens that safe. Anyone who has your private key can take everything from it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:19:13
Core will not overwrite an existing wallet.dat if it finds one. If it doesn't find one, it'll create a new one
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:03:51
It doesn't sound like the wallet is broken
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:26:41
Nope, you wouldn't.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:20:25

You can just temporarily uninstall one of the four to use another one, and reinstall it when you need that coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:43
1. Send the BTC/LTC/ETH/whatever to a temporary wallet. 
2. Reset the Ledger Nano S and configure as a new device
3. Note down the new seed
4. Send everything to the new addresses.
Do not add a passphrase to the same seed. It is considerably less secure than moving to a new seed.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:45:57
`openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in wallet.aes.json -out wallet.json`
Once you have the decrypted JSON, you should be able to get the raw private keys.
Feel free to drop me a PM, I specialise in Coin recovery and might be able to help (see for past work)
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:05:09
Do  you remember the password?
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:17:02
Nothing, it's an exchange, not an ICO
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:40:40
Are you sure your wallet.dat is for Bitcoin? If you have a fully synced core, but are still getting missing inputs, your wallet is probably from another chain.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:37:54
1. Do NOT share these words with anyone. Doesn't matter who. Family, redditor, teacher, friend, me, irrelevant.
2. PM me and I will walk you through checking if there are any Bitcoin on them.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:17:18
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:05:47
Every wallet I've seen in the past several years uses AES, so I'm guessing you're getting the password wrong.
If you have a substantial amount in it, it may be worth it to hit up 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:38:27
Can you not just put in the seed to the functional ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:01:51
Glad to hear it!
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:31:50
The 0.06 is likely in another address on your Ledger. You're looking up only one address on an explorer, the Ledger will show you the balance for all addresses on it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:44:06
Cryptonator is sending the transaction, so they control the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:26:48
Yes, you can.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:36:38
It's likely 12 seed words plus a passphrase word
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:58:42
Open Bitcoin-qt, go to Help-&gt;Debug Window-&gt;Console, run `dumpwallet &lt;path to a file where you want to save the keys&gt;`, open that file, import the private keys into electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:15:50
`openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in wallet.aes.json -out wallet.json`
Keep trying that, with as many passwords as you can possibly imagine, and all their variations.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:16:24
Look up the addresses on Blockchain.info, perhaps core has downloaded the chain but hasn't indexed the transactions for your wallet. You may have already spent them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:30:54
Two possibilities:
1. They haven't broadcast it yet
2. They did broadcast it, but it has too low a fee for the current network state, and was rejected by most nodes
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:33:19
If you are willing to send me a list of the public addresses, I can scan them for you. I work at an exchange, we have the infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:26:04
What's the transaction ID?
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:09:50
Spend the change with a much higher fee
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:04:34
What's the transaction ID? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:17:19
Contact ViaBTC, which mined that tx, and ask them to refund you. Pools have refunded very high, accidental fees in the past, so you may have some luck.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:09:11
Your file is aes encrypted. No password, no keys. There is no way around it, unless you have an unencrypted back up or the original seed words as well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:34:10
Enter 12, then enter the thirteenth when they ask for a passphrase
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:05:12
Nope, just a username
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:03:21
Hmm. Are you positive it's fully synced, in that case?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:44:53
If you're on the receiving end, just make another transaction to yourself. 
If you sent them from the ledger to an exchange or other wallet, they'll have to make the transaction (unless there was change coming back to your wallet, in which case you can spend that).
I can give you a more concrete answer if you share a tx hash.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:00:32
It is possible, just import the private key into a client for the other chains.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:40:30
It is encrypted, most likely with AES. Seems too small to be a wallet.dat, but might be a good wallet.json.
Do you have any idea what the password is? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:02:00
You can try restoring the string in a wallet such as Mycelium
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:59:13
It'll be there on the new one.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:16:45
Most likely, the tx got dropped before it got confirmed.
None of the txs on that address match your tx id.
Check the address you sent the BTC from to see if it's still on there.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:59:45
Depends on your fee and the network state.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:01:44
You can always sweep it using something like electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:52:47
 then Electrum.
Though I believe Electrum 3+ will work directly with the seed even for segwit
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:50:49
You haven't double spent, you've created a chain of 2 tx. One of them spends the output of the other.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:37:40
The private key derived here is only for the login and your keys. Green Addresses also use a second private key that is held by them, and cannot be accessed via your seed.
Running the code is easy enough. Just set up NodeJS and install Bitcoinjs-lib.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:09:38
What are the contents of bitcoin.conf
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:21:23
I'm guessing `0.02341384` BTC came back to your ledger, so you should be able to just make another transaction with a (much) higher fee to send your balance to yourself, effectively creating a child pays for parent.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:05:53
I can help, feel free to drop me a pm. You can see for past work with coin recovery 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:55:25
You should wait until there's at least 2 confirmations.

They will die before they make any money.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:35:42

I can try and help. Can you pm me a tx hash? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:37:26
What's the transaction hash?
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:23:20
If there is any change that went back to your ledger, spend it with a much higher fee
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:45:32
You need to give it the wallet import format. No wallet I know of supports a direct hex string.
You can use an offline version of Bitaddress.org to get from hex to wif.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:21:36
Take an address for each coin on the broken ledger from the working on. Reset the working one with the broken seed. Move all the coins to the previously collected addresses. Reset the working one back to its seed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:07:11
Hmm. If you run dumpprivkey on your addresses and import them into Electrum, you might have some more luck.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:21:51
Not even if it

You need to know the 1-address that corresponds to the key. Bitaddress.org can give you that.
Then just run:
`importprivkey "k..." "somelabel" false`  
`addwitnessaddress &lt;1-address-from-bit-address&gt;`
Then just close the Bitcoin client and restart it with a rescan option (steps differ by OS, Google is your friend).
The Bitcoin node will need to be synced for this to work, which can take a while. You can maybe try to find another Light client that supports segwit, but I'm not sure of any.

Your Ledger uses an HD wallet which is a chain. The seed words can generate thousands of private keys, each with its own address
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:30:45
Each Segwit private key also corresponds to a regular, non-segwit address. Due to this, even in the core client, you mush use addwitnessaddress to set up the segwit address first.
I currently believe that electrum does not support the segwit addresses starting with 3 on a per address basis, only if you import the address as part of a BIP39 seed.
You can still access the funds using Bitcoin-qt in all likelihood.

Yes, you will need to wait until the download is complete. Alternatively, you could export the keys and import them into a light wallet such as Electrum, which does not require the full chain to be downloaded.
You can also look up the transaction hashes on blockchain.info or another explorer to see if they have been spent.

Depending on which wallet you're using, you could abandon the transaction. Since it has been dropped from the mempool, it'll be like it never happened.
You could also get the raw tx and rebroadcast it, again depending on if you wallet lets you do that.
You could also export your private key into another wallet and send a new tx.
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:22:10
1. Protecting one phrase that leads to thousands of keys is far easier than protecting thousand of unrelated keys

Well, no. Since it still shows up on some explorers, it's still in some nodes' mempools. If one of those pools is used to source transactions for a block, it could still confirm.

This is just terrible advice. If you have any amount of money you intend on keeping safe, you should move to a hardware wallet or a paper wallet system.
Linux can also be compromised if not secured properly, and most people do not secure it properly. If your wallet lives on an accessible machine, it can probably be accessed.

1. Do NOT tell anybody irl
2. Move them to a long-term wallet. If these coins are from long enough in the past, they're linked to raw private keys, not deterministic, seed based addresses. One good harddrive cash and you'll lose it all.
3. Trezor and Ledger are both trustworthy hardware wallets. Get one, keep the seed very, very safe. Make sure you write it down and lock it up somewhere no one can get to it.
4. Spend your time to do some research. You'll need to transfer Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and your Bitcoin. Make sure to move the Bitcoin first, then the Bitcoin Cash, then the Bitcoin Gold to avoid chances of being scammed.
5. Take your time to understand everything that may have changed since you last played around with it. You potentially have a lot of money, and it would be wise to not lose it to a preventable error. There's no hurry here.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:44:04
Bitcoin has forked into two additional coins in the past few months. You have an equal amount of all of them. For instance, if you had 1 BTC, you now have 1 BTC, 1 BCH (Bitcoin Cash), and 1 BTG (Bitcoin Gold).
All three are accessible on the same private key(s).
Due to them being linked to the same private keys, you should move them very carefully. Do NOT trust any online service that claims to be able to split your coins for you. Many, many people have been scammed by these recently.
Instead, first send the BTC from your wallet to your new wallet. This leaves the BCH and BTG on the original private keys.
Then, use Electron Cash or a Bitcoin Cash node if you have time to sync to transfer the BCH to your new BCH wallet (Ledger and Trezor both let you have a BTC and BCH wallet on a single device).
BTG is a bit trickier, and likely the scammiest of all so far. I would personally just leave it on the original private keys for the moment, and print those out in a paper wallet and store them in a safe or something.
Feel free to drop a PM if you ever have any questions in the process. I somewhat specialize in coin recoveries (for proof) and am happy to guide you through the process, and Bitcoin security in general.
But, most importantly, *never* share your private keys with anybody. In fact, if the amounts in question are large enough, I would implore you to sign all of the transactions to move your coins to a new wallet completely offline, use a USB or something to move them to a different, internet connected computer, and then broadcast them for extra safety. Being paranoid is sometimes a good thing. I can also help guide you through that, if you wish.

Your transaction was likely dropped from mempools due to the congestion on the network right now after not confirming for some time. The node on the second link still has it in its mempool, blockcypher doesn't.
You can ask your friend to resend the transaction if his/her wallet allows it (which depends on whether the node the wallet is connected to has it in its mempool).
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:50:33
I don't recall if Electrum uses Hardened or non-hardened addresses off the top of my head, but you should ideally generate a new address, move any BTC to that, and then share a private key if you have to, as certain types of chains can be compromised with a single private key leak ([source](
Why on earth are you sharing a private key anyways?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:18:24
I have a past reputation for coin recover. You can check out I also work at an exchange and am happy to prove identity over PMs.

You will need to import them in a specific manner. Not all wallets are compatible with each other due to derivation paths etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:15:54
Bitcoin-qt will not show the tx until it has downloaded the block that contains it. Considering the current size of the blockchain, this could easily take you several days.
It's not common to use Bitcoin-qt as a day to day client any more, unless you have a specific reason for doing that. You will be better off exporting your private keys into a wallet such as Electrum, which doesn't require a large blockchain sync to function.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:20:41
Well, it's still possible to manually do a double spend (most wallets won't allow it if they see an existing outgoing tx).
I'm about to head out for a bit, but I can try and walk you through it in a few hours. Feel free to drop a PM 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:05:55
Mining bitcoin on a desktop will get you nowhere.

@_date: 2017-11-22 11:25:41
If you are going to paper wallet route (even temporarily to hold while you wait for the ledger), make absolutely sure you generate it very securely. There are a number of websites out there that will save private keys when you generate them. Be very careful. Ideally, to create a "paper wallet", download and verify something such as Electrum, move it to an offline computer via USB/CD, set it up on the offline computer, then generate an address.

You can use address 0 as many times as you like. However, it is recommended to use a different address to receive each payment for privacy reasons.

@_date: 2017-11-18 09:13:34
It should be pretty easy to "double spend" that old a tx if you have the private key. Just import it into Electrum or another wallet, and you should be able to just... spend it.
It's not even really a double spend at this point since it's so old that more or less every mempool should have cleared it. 
You might see it on some block explorers due to caching etc., but it should be easily replaced.

Well, I dunno about that wallet in particular, but most wallets will automatically show you the latest unused address when you go to a receive tab.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:51:23
The receiving addresses you are shown are a new one each time. Try to check the addresses you sent BTC to in the past. You should be able to find a record of the tx in whatever place you sent the BTC to the ledger from.

It's possible you have a passphrase to your wallet.dat. Unfortunately, it's pretty worthless unless you also backed up the wallet.dat

Indeed, you are right! Thank you, looks like I missed that update. However, in this particular tx's case, looks like most nodes have already dropped it according to blockcypher.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:37:29
Electrum 2fa wallets are multisig, and will only reveal one private key in the UI. You need the seed to get a second one.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:52:27
HD wallets usually are a chain of addresses. Most wallets will generate a few to start with, and generate more as you use them. It's normal, you can use all of them, and you'll be able to access the Bitcoin from multiple addresses in a wallet at once.

Good to hear! Ledger is a solid choice.
Yes, keeping coins in the Ledger is definitely a good choice. Just make sure to write down the seed words the Ledger gives you when you set it up, and keep them somewhere very safe. As in, literally in a safe would be a good idea. Perhaps a bank vault if the value is high enough.

The transaction this tx was spending (`5c35e89d7e77ea2741deab08a5f0ee3903c2699b4f7b55e320eaa52ae6ef21ef`) is no longer in the blockchain or mempool, and was likely dropped. Thus, this tx was dropped as well.
Your BTC is still in whichever address it was before all this. If you withdrew from an exchange, you need to contact them to resend.

Bitcoin transactions can only spend whole inputs. The rest must go as change to the same/another address.
Most wallets use a new change address to protect your privacy.
It's sort of like if you give someone $20 to buy a $15 thing. You'll get $5. It goes back into your wallet, but it is a different note.
All the change addresses are similarly part of your wallet, and you can still spend the amount.
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:12:28
Well, you still need 13 characters, each of which can be from a pool of 58. So you have 13^58 possibilities, or 40617616406773309930154634339905725588976750479274358606191163529.

That is an omni layer transfer, not just a BTC transfer. The Omni Protocol requires that a BTC amount just over the dust limit is sent to the recipient BTC address for identifying who is receiving the tokens. While the fee could certainly be lower, Poloniex has historically paid high fees to have their user withdrawals processed faster.
If you lookup the [same tx]( on an Omni-aware explorer, you can see that the actual withdrawal was for 208 Maidsafe coins, not the BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:51:54
Sure, there's a learning curve. I would suggest you write on guide on how to use things like BIP38 instead of this. By telling new users to follow weaker protection methods, you're leaving them open to attack in the future. People rarely change habits, and someone using a rotation cipher for 0.001 BTC might continue using it for 10 BTC in a few months/years, thinking they're safe.
If you teach them to use the proper methods from day one, you're helping them far more.

It has segwit support, just not at a UI level. You can still create segwit addresses manually, and send and receive payments from them normally after that

Methods like this should be avoided. They're trivial to crack. There are already much stronger, readily available, well supported encryption methods around. More over, private keys have their own password encryption standard defined in [BIP 38]( It's far better to use that. You can add in Shamir Key Sharing if you wish to make it harder than just a password.

It went back to your Electrum wallet, in all likelihood, as change.
If your Electrum is 2fa enabled, it may have been your 2fa fee. You occasionally have to pay trusted coin for the 2fa service.
@_date: 2018-03-11 06:09:35
You can copy the raw transaction from electrum and broadcast it manually. However, since the transaction you are spending no longer exists, no node will accept this.
Do you know which address the BTC is in?
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:04:04
Ah, that's likely a segwit address. Electrum can't import individual segwit keys as far as I'm aware. You'll either need to wait for core to sync, or use a waller such as Samurai Wallet (I believe they support individual segwit keys, but I have no experience with them so cannot comment on security or trustworthiness)

Once a btc transfer is made, it's irreversible. The only ways to not get scammed are to either have them ship it first, and pay after receiving it, or to escrow the funds.
If you send them the BTC and they send you nothing, you're out of luck, beyond law enforcement help.

Hardware wallets for day to day use, encrypted paper wallets stored in a physically safe location (bank vaults etc.) for true cold storage.
There's a rabbithole of security you can go down depending on your budget/paranoia. For most people, a hardware wallet is good enough for both cold and hot wallets.
If hardware wallets aren't an option, one should, at the very least, use a client where they control their keys such as Electrum or the Core wallets, along with a strong password.
Most paper wallet generators support BIP38, so if you're going the paper wallet route, that's about as easy as it gets. Just set a password, and remember it.
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:02:51
So... they haven't started yet?
@_date: 2017-09-27 02:09:18
I can probably help recover the wallet, provided you can still get in to it (don't need to be able to send, just open it in Electrum).
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:16:02
Check your Bitcoin address on a Bitcoin Cash blockchain explorer. If you see a balance there, try using another wallet to recover it. If you don't see a balance, you have no Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:27:34
There's probably just an error with the explorer. Your transactions are fine:

Yeah, got super confused for a moment.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:59:14
These are most likely an exchange consolidating outputs. With the fees so high recently, a lot of exchanges/services chose to just let the smaller amounts sit until it was feasible to consolidate.

If this was towards the end of 2013, it may be a BIP39 phrase. Use Electrum, restore wallet, enter the words, and check the BIP39 box and see if it gets you anywhere.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:22:20
Your funds are fully moved. The easiest way would be to shift the private key to a simple wallet, such as electrum (shouldn't be too hard as you have the seed words).
You can also try restoring the wallet on a fresh install of MultiBit (preferably on a different machine), which should cause it to resync completely.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:07:01
Just wait it out, it'll confirm eventually. Low fees are doing alright these days.

That's just the change address. When you sent from your Trezor, the input used was for more than the amount you were spending. The balance was sent back to a change address on your Trezor.
It's like if you buy a $5 thing with $20. You'll get $15 back to your own wallet.

That's just a purely native-segwit tx. Nothing special about it
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:48:28
It's trivial to keep tracing the outputs if you know how to. Just because explorers haven't updated, doesn't mean it can't be done. Anyone with a full node can track the outputs in about 10 minutes with a simple script.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:18:32
1. Electrum will generate a wallet even if the seed words aren't BIP39. There's no guarantee that it's the same wallet you had. If you see transactions going in and out in the history, you can tell if it's your wallet. If there's no history, it's probably not.
2. If you hadn't transferred them out before they shut down, you've likely lost it.

What is the address? 
@_date: 2018-07-15 10:28:24

There are many tools and wallets that support BIP38 out of the box, even if you don't wish to get into split keys. Even a paper wallet with BIP38 from BitAddress.org offers more protection than a rotation cipher.
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:03:59
I can't speak for why blockchain.info hasn't done it. Perhaps they have other priorities. Insight is barely maintained, and their patched nodes with address indexing have long since been abandoned. They don't have a patched version of Bitcoin Core that supports segwit.
Simply because an explorer hasn't done it, doesn't mean it cannot be done. The folks tracking transactions are not relying on explorers to do it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:17:34
Just convert the private key to a regular BTC address. A segwit address is a specific type of address, but each key will also correspond to a regular P2PKH address.
Why do you need this, though?
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:34:10
Where did you get the address from?
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:19:12
Segwit addresses are functionally similar to the regular 1 and 3 addresses we've seen in the past. It's just that most explorers don't know how to index them yet, so they will often skip displaying them.
They're as anonymous as regular addresses. If someone is known to control an address, it's not anonymous
@_date: 2018-07-19 02:07:12
Only if you review it first. It's trivial to make a backdoored seed generator that generates predictable seeds even when offline. No exfiltration is required if your seed can be predicted by an attacker.

Public keys are just derived from your private keys. If the public key changes, so does the private key.
Your best bet here is to find every single wallet.dat you've ever had, and check them all individually. Keypools do change in multiple cases, and skipping a file may mean skipping addresses.
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:55:02
100 containing a total of 0.01, or 100 containing 0.01 each?
A single transaction with a single output would merge them into one place. Now is likely the best time to do it since tx fees are low. Make sure you use a wallet that lets you set absolutely minimal fees, as you may wipe out any potential saving otherwise.

Mixers are a way to prevent tracing of, or at the very least make it hard to trace, Bitcoin. A bunch of people send Bitcoin to a mixer. The mixer takes a small fee, and sends you Bitcoin from a completely different address, breaking the chain of traceability.
If you buy Bitcoin on Coinbase, they know which address is yours. They can just follow the transactions starting from that address to see where that Bitcoin is going, linking it to known addresses along the way (businesses, pools, etc.) to get an idea of where you sent your money. By using a mixer, you break that chain, and prevent them (or anyone) from easily following you.
Sadly, a lot of mixers you see are scams. You send them money, they send nothing back. On the bright side, Coinbase can no longer trace you because you have nothing left to trace.
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:38:55
We do have many orphaned bitcoin, especially from the early days when users didn't care about them (they had next to no value) and simply deleted or lost their wallets. These make them inaccessible, and effectively non-existent. Thus, the total available Bitcoin will always be less than 21 million.
Every time any bitcoin are rendered inaccessible, they technically marginally increase the value of all the accessible bitcoin.
Fortunately for us, there is no real limit on how much a single bitcoin can be subdivided. Currently one Bitcoin is split into 100,000,000 subunits (Satoshis). In the future, if needed, the protocol can be adjusted to allow further subdivision easily enough.

You can export them on Electrum, but you can also just use the seed mnemonic on the new wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:16:41
If it's a seed sentence (12 words, so decent probability) you can try restoring it using Electrum, Mycelium, Core, or any other wallet that supports seed words.
Once you get it into a wallet, you can export private keys individually if you so desire.

This is a scam. Do not give them your money. The actual site is a .com, not a .im. The link takes you to the wrong place.

Theoretically, yes. However, with the current state of the network, it might be a while before a higher fee transaction goes through as well.
It's also not all that easy to actually get a wallet to broadcast a double spend, since most restrict against it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:48:29
I believe that particular wallet uses AES, so you should be able to transfer the wallet to a computer and use openssl to decrypt it like so:
`openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -a -in &lt;encrypted_wallet&gt; -out &lt;decrypted_wallet&gt; -k &lt;your_password&gt;`
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:14:05
Unless you have the wallet.dat + password, or the seed phrase given to you at the creation of your wallet, your coins are lost.

It is impossible to determine what created an address.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:17:48
It boils down to the price when the transaction actually goes through, but yes. That's the gist of it.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:18:58
It's worth the memories, that's it. Maybe a penny if you melt it down for scrap.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:35:27
Well, at least you guys registered an account that actually matches what you're scamming this time. Way to go with the linking though!
This is a scam. Do not contribute. The actual website is a .com, not a .im.
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:26:18
You can look up the transaction hash to see how many confirmations it has.
Beyond that, after yesterday's price jumps, the network is under high load, and transactions are taking longer to confirm, especially those with small fees. I've had a transaction sitting with no confirmations for about 12 hours now, but it'll eventually go through. Probably the same case for yours.
@_date: 2017-06-29 05:07:12
It's a TOR network link. Whether or not it's a legitimate, I can't say.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:00:33
It's hard to tell in this way, but I can PM you
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:55:04
That would work, but I would strongly suggest using something like Electrum instead where you don't have to share your keys with an online service 
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:49:03
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:26:00
Try and find the original hard drive, and locate a [wallet.dat]( on it
@_date: 2017-06-29 05:30:29
You're very likely okay. A little bit of Paranoia is good, and formatting your phone may have been a slightly extreme, but entirely good idea.
If you want to be extra, extra safe, take any Bitcoin that you had in a wallet on your phone, and simply send them to an address generated in some other wallet (on your computer, another phone, Coinbase, whatever). In the extremely unlikely event that someone managed to compromise your phone using a link and gain access to your wallet and hasn't spent the Bitcoin yet, spending them yourself first will make any private keys they own useless.
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:18:26
It will eventually disappear from the mempools, provided no one is rebroadcasting it and the mempool operators don't insist on storing them.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:45:52
You can simply skip out on Bitcoin Core and import your keys into a wallet that doesn't require you to download the entire blockchain. PM me, and I can walk you through it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:27:58
Provided someone broadcast the transaction, it should show up right away on the network, even if it has no confirmations.
 Double check and ensure you're looking at the same address in both places.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:30:13
This is a scam. Their actual website is a .com
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:22:43
Just PM'd you with an alternative :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:34:17
That depends on the Electrum devs, but someone will create a wallet for whatever chain electrum is not on, and provided they follow the seed mnemonic spec, you should be able to import your keys using that.
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:30:26
1. Do you have a backup of your armory wallet?
2. Are you positive that `1AtAEzLsSSuSjcjaSW5AzyH7hQaG6y1Dhf` is not a change address in your own wallet? Most wallets will send all funds (at least when everything is in one address) when you make a transaction, and split it between your destination and change address.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:15:40
Right, didn't see it was you. You're best off just waiting for the transaction to drop from most mempools and creating a new one.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:41:37
The simplest way would be to just transfer the bitcoin to another wallet via a regular transaction.
A more involved method would be to export the private keys and import them into a wallet such as mycelium. Not all wallets use the seed word system.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:12:26
They do. All the online explorers, exchanges, and services operate at least one full node for each currency they support.
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:50:10
You've probably mixed up the seed. Go into the Android Mycelium, select your wallet, and hit create back up. It should show you the seed again. If that's not an option, you can select the wallet and export the private keys, then load them into another wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:05:19

The address (I'm guessing it's the one that starts with a `1` or `3`) is just the public part of your Bitcoin wallet. The .dat file contains the private part, and the seed words help you calculate it again in the event that your .dat is lost/corrupted.
There is no such thing as a password in Bitcoin. The password is just to encrypt your wallet.dat, and prevent someone from stealing it and using it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:20:42
Your bitcoin never leave until your transaction is confirmed. Most wallets just say they have.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:57:29
You don't need a multiplatform wallet. Just import your seed/private keys in multiple individual wallets if you need to access from elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:55:28
So it looks like 2 BTC is in 1Ff3jnUqrfR3hidg5MsZBbTafu25wCVrJ8, and the remaining 5.01339036 BTC went back to 1Jo5jjR5J59bCqmaHaGRinmyS3fooFaXoh.
So you say 1Ff3jnUqrfR3hidg5MsZBbTafu25wCVrJ8 is in Armory. In all probability, all you need to do is rescan (usually restarting Armory does this just fine). However, Armory does need a source for the blockchain. If your Bitcoin core client is saying there's no data, it is possible that you will need to redownload the entire chain, which may take a few days.
An alternative is to export the private key and import it into a lightweight wallet such as Electrum.
You should be able to see the 5.X Bitcoin in the wallet you sent them from.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:22:19
Pretty much.
It's usually pretty fast if you're buying and selling on Coinbase directly, since they're mostly offchain if you stick to Coinbase. Recently, they've been under too much load, so things error out/are running slow. You might have better luck with Bittrex or another actual trading platform, where you can bid on buy/sell prices and be sure of what you're getting.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:34:06
Several wallets out there (Electrum, Mycelium etc). use an online service to look up details from the blockchain instead of doing it locally. This makes them take up considerably less space, and perform much faster than Core.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:34:33
I thought the the JSON file contained the 12 words, apologies. It's difficult to say what to do with the file without an idea of its contents, I'm afraid, and you probably do not want to be posting those on a public forum in case it turns out to be private keys or seeds.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:48:20
Not entirely sure if I want to be buying stuff from a website that lost its payment address' private key.

There are currently 60k+ unconfirmed transactions, most with significantly higher fees than those two. Just sit back and wait, the network will clear up in a couple of days, hopefully.
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:43:52
If you don't want to go back to Armory, just sweep your private keys into Electrum or Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:29:12
Electrum (desktop), Mycelium (iOS and Android)
The Core wallet is a full wallet, and downloads the entire chain. The two I mentioned are lightwallets, and sync using remote Bitcoin nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:39:26
I don't believe Coinbase supports sweeping. You'll have to go through something else. Try Mycelium or Electrum.
