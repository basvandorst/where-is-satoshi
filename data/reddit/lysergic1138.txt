Segwit fees are cheaper but still relatively expensive to other alts. I paid $12.98 to send $3500 of BTC from my ledger to Binance.
Confirmation times have been 2-4 hours over the last week. Granted most of the exchanges choose not to switch their support to segwit. LN has been promised for years now and here we are.
I honestly believe BTC will drop in dominance to &lt;15% by end of 2018. Both of these issues need to be addressed in the next 6 months if BTC is to reign.

BTC is dying.

I know we're due for a beefy correction when these kinds of shit posts keep making the FP.
Gonna be a lot of sad pandas around here panic selling and calling it a scam because they bought in @ ATH.

These 'stories' are getting ridiculous.

The shitposts are getting shittier but people do anything for karma.
Sorry you're getting downvoted - it is an echo chamber in here after all :/

I'm okay with this.

Lets see if you still have that opinion after November 16.
Not bashing BTC by any means but this pump for "free" coins is completely unsustainable. BTC WILL correct after the fork, rightfully so, and then we may see legitimate continued organic growth.
I feel bad for those going all in right now. Sure long term it won't matter but there's gonna be a lot of sad pandas post-fork.

So if I search for Bitcoin 100 times I'll make 91% gains?
