Display error or not, errors in your *balance* for a *financial service* are bad.  If this is a widespread error (as opposed to a rare error, triggered by an obscure corner case) it's *really* bad.
Payments is a pretty complicated space, and keeping track of balances properly is really not the most complicated problem these guys need to solve.  It'd be like building an aircraft when you can't even get the altimeter working right.

OK.  Thanks for the response.

"Sorry, but our SMS service is not currently available in your country."
This is what I get when I try to create a wallet.  I'm in the US.  Where *does* this work?  And what's the obstacle to a US rollout?

Didn't know they were still in beta.  But, oy... I have an appreciation for what "beta" means, yet seeing *balance* bugs this far into the development process still seems scary.  That stuff should be fucking rock-solid.

Oh, sorry dude, it was just *my* front page.  I just assumed this was in or something not I feel silly.




We need 'em, that's for sure.
There's a conference in Austin on June 21st called [Voice &amp; Exit]( that might be up your alley.  (I'm taking a *wild guess* that you're based in Austin.)  Lots of competitive governance / ancap stuff.  "If SXSW and TED had a lovechild with Peter Thiel, this would be it" is one of their taglines.
Anyway, good luck with your campaign!

Pro-ancap and you managed to make the front page on Reddit?  Well done!  Speaks well of your political charisma :-)
OK!  What about seasteading?  Startup cities?  Competitive governance?  You must be a fan, it's states' rights on a broader scale!

Are you lumping the signature forgery in with "cultural misunderstanding?"

Yeah, it's a disappointing state of affairs, isn't it?  Part of our hope with this protocol is that it highlights just how much the ecosystem needs better cold storage tools.
@_date: 2017-02-11 02:55:15
Thanks for the feedback!
You're right in that any protocol is only helpful to the degree it's executed properly, and tedium and complexity increase execution risk.  We've tried to minimize the ambiguity and complexity as much as possible -- the protocol involves almost no decisions or problem-solving for the user, just straightforward execution -- but this does come at the expense of great tedium.
The long-term answer is better tools -- for example, hardware wallets focused on high-security cold storage (which never connect to a computer via USB, use QR codes for input/output, can take in user-supplied entropy for key generation, etc.). But since we don't have those today, we hope Glacier can help bridge the gap for some people.
@_date: 2017-02-12 05:55:37
Thanks a lot for finding all of those, we'll fix them all in the next release.  And add a final spell check to our release checklist.
Storing a printed QR code of the cold storage address rather than the printed copy makes sense.  I'm a little surprised we didn't go that route, I don't see a good reason not to offhand.  Might change this in v1.0.
Your point about signing the transaction one key at a time makes sense to me too.

Thanks for the link, hadn't come across this.  
The CCSS standards seem to be geared towards organizations w/custody of others' assets, which is a very different use case.  But definitely some significant overlap.  We'll go through it and see which of their recommendations apply to this.

Yes, this would be really interesting to hear.  I'm specifically interested to understand what application(s) they use, and whether they have to circumvent any gov't attempts to block those applications.  (do they use Tor, VPNs, etc...)

Thanks for the AMA :-)  .01 BTC @_date: 2015-02-09 21:05:21
The most interesting thing about his comments is that they imply Bitcoins are just as "valid" as gold or fiat, and that this implication does not seem particularly controversial or noteworthy on the newscast.
His central point (in response to the Swiss central bank) is that gold has no intrinsic value.  He argues this by comparing gold to both paper and Bitcoin, claiming *none* of them have (non-negligible) intrinsic value, that they *all* derive their value from the fact that other people accept them as money.  
From this particular angle, it's an elevation of Bitcoin -- it's assumed to be on equal ground with other currencies.  Good to hear from a "big finance" guy.
He's obviously missing the mark on other critical points -- for example, saying the *primary* difference of Bitcoin vs. paper is the expensive production cost.  But hey, one step at a time.

Re: not having your finances tracked -- how do you get BTC as income?  And is that channel a potential way you can get tracked?  (Not trying to be argumentative, just curious about the corner cases here)
