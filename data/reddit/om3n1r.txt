You people sure love being dramatic, lol. If It's even really happening, it's just people finding a way to skirt their shitty government financial regulations

Thanks! How do I actually find this wallet?

Read this theory on another forum. Decided to overlay the graphs. Can't deny the correlation is pretty striking.
The Chinese govt has huge restrictions on outflow of money from the country. Rich Chinese are finding every loophole to circumvent this. First it was Real Estate abroad, until the govt cracked down on that.
Most recently it has been gambling trips to places like Australia where the 'tourists' will come home and report huge losses, while leaving the money abroad.
Not sure how to play this as the correlation seems so immediate. But interesting nonetheless

No way to know without knowing what the Chinese govt plans are ahead of time (impossible)
It's just an interesting correlation, and shows another example of crypto being used in interesting ways to skirt banking systems and finance laws

YOu know GDAX is owned by Coinbase right?

The Silk Road book is called American Kingpin, and it is absolutely fantastic.

No way Dorian Nakamoto is Satoshi. That guy was hilarious though. He just wanted some lunch

GDAX was down for me for about half an hour during the big dip. Coinbase still down

I have read about this as well. The book did not give me the impression at all that he was violent or dangerous.
The murder story that sticks out most to me was the DEA agents nearly drowning and posing the SR employee they caught, and dripping tomato soup out of his mouth to create proof that the murder had been carried out. That's hardly a pro government narrative.
I respect his mom's opinion though, and the book did nothing to sway my opinion that Ross Simply got in over his head when things began growing too fast.
I can see how those unfamiliar with the story may misread his intentions due to some of the techniques used in the writing (the filling in of details the author could not have known exactly)
The amount of research Bilton did for the book is rather staggering though, and it is a story that needs to be heard.
It's a shame he wrote it imperfectly.

I figured. Still cool though :)

It was for me, during the whole dip, and a lot of other people if you read around.

Is there a hard statistic for current # of btc in existence (about 16.5mil last I heard), against # of btc being held/not active?
Would love to do more reading on that.
