Look at 2008 Maryland and 2010 Michigan Jesus Christ 
 
Not a good source but has the most evidence/data. Matter of fact go to the ACLUs website it’s their job to try and stop this foolishness. They have legal cases on there. lookup Kris Kobach (vice chair of the President commission on election integrity) you’ll see his many lawsuits. 
on gerrymandering, I don’t know if you know this (outsider) but Republicans literally have MORE CHANCES to gerrymander since they won way more in 2010. (Redistricting after 2010 census). 
Considering you called me a cheerleader for giving you a Snapple fact I’m starting to think you’ve fallen in the polarity trap anyway sadly. 
Not replying to whatever you say next to continue this pointless argument that’s already made me do a lil research to prove something I already know is true. As if I have to convince you of anything lmao

Of course it’s not exclusive lmao winning tactic will always be used by both the losers and winners, but it would be a literal lie to say that the GOP hasn’t been doing it way more recently because they’re scared lmao

I’m a cheerleader? How? All I said is that it’s a literal fact that the GOP have been gerrymandering and suppressing votes MORE recently. If stating a fact as simple as that makes me a cheerleader on either side then you are just ignorant I guess lol
