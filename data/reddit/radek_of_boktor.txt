Getting paid tomorrow. I'll definitely be buying the dip. I sold a good bit at 17k so I'm doing pretty well as far as reading the trends goes.

I hear this could blow up to $420 by the end of 2018!

This is exactly how I've used it. I threw in $20 or $30 here or there back when bitcoin was around $1000. Played around with bitcoin tips on reddit and those faucet giveaway sites. Then I forgot about it for a few years. Ended up selling about $400 at $17000 and I'm holding the rest just to see where it goes.

Anyone else having trouble with logging in to Coinbase? It will let me log in, but the dashboard just displays the blue bar at the top and a blank white screen.
Edit: I'm in! Nobody panic.

Asking the real questions

Who's to say that people haven't already collectively decided that bitcoin is worth $10k±market fluctuation? It's been jumping above and below $10k for weeks and there's no reason to believe it won't keep doing that for some time. 
I mean, it could jump to 100k by the end of the year, but don't act like it's already been decided.

Ok, that's what I thought. Thanks.

Keep in mind that these were sent when the MM sub was just beginning and no one really knew where it was going. The point was to spread awareness of the sub's existence and maybe drum up some more participants in round one.
Also, my letter said nothing about related subreddit sidebar listings, which are generally more attractive to mods than "hey, let me post on *your* sub about *my* sub!" Now that has grown substantially I don't think it would be out of line to ask again.
