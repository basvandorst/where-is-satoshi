You should be fine sending from the exchange to your ledgers segwit address. As long as you have the software , your wallet will be available
I think segwit addresses start with a 3?
I  think there are 2 forms of segwit. Im not sure if they're both compatible with legacy addresses or not
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:25:40
Try updating the firmware in the ledger manager app. 
If that doesn't work,  post over on @_date: 2018-01-17 16:06:19
Honestly no one can tell you for sure.  I'm personally just waiting to see where the dust settles, if it does at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:03:07
yes. lol here's hoping it stays yes.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:29:39
if we get to it that is.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:54:03
I honestly didn't have much of a problem with bch until they started calling themselves the real bitcoin, that was pretty absurd. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:48:46
It said try again later.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:26:01
Changing addresses? like each time you get a deposit? that's for privacy, almost every wallet does that. you could just use the same address if you wanted. electrum's fine. I personally use a Ledger nano s.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:53:45
all these posts about lightning  are pretty exciting
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:38:24
Yep was fine handling the 50k volume down, but up? Nah
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:05:12
Fine maybe it's not Chinese new year and just January ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:11:42
I think you'd have to load your seed into a bch/btg wallet and get them that way. The safest way I  think is make as new offline wallet then  transfer your btc to it, then use the original wallets seed in a wallet for bch/btg and do what you will with them
Edit: fixing auto correct errors
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:32:15
I hope it's sooner!  but LN still has bugs to iron out and support needs to happen. Let's see what happens!
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:48:39
Depends on the fees used for the transaction. I'm very unfamiliar with slushpool and if it chooses the fee for you.  Do you have the transaction ID? could you link to it on a blockchain explorer? I'm no expert but I could try to help you estimate it.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:19:02
looks like we're gonna play the 'keep it barely above 11k' game for a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:37:01
First of all thieves* and if we need to, we can always subdivide satoshis with a soft fork.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:43:09
In the chrome app try going to settings  then tools then reset application data, then let it resync
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:45:54
 Something happened to your app there haha
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:53:42
Trezor's also seen as good. You could also move your coins to as desktop wallet like electrum and wait for the ledger to come back in stock
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:53:34
Man the mempool and fees are starting to go down, thats a nice sight to see
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:29:07
I have to say this is pretty sweet. are these nodes transacting for any goods or is it just for shits and giggles at the moment?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:06:10
I'm on the east coast, I checked GDAX when I woke up at 6AM and thought to myself it's gonna be a long day
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:32:54
Well,  here comes the volume on gdax,  geez
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:18:56
Now is that wall at 10,200 gonna hold on GDAX?
edit RIP
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:47:15
Holy shit the bulls are running wild
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:20:39
I missed that 700 last night. Saw that 300. Yeah, walls are basically nothing right now. Not a great day for crypto in general
well, except for sell walls it seems those are tough haha
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:16:03
try asking @_date: 2018-01-17 21:40:36
Didn't you post this like 2 hours ago? lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:14:13
Can't lie,  actually chuckled at that one
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:56:49
what do you mean new bitcoins? you mean alt-coins?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:51:49
Man that volume on GDAX is insane.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:50:52
they're starting it back up at bitconnectx I think, the scum.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:21:08
Dude I don't know if you're trolling, or serious but please don't do this. this is a terrible idea.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:56:31
Fair. Well, if you do get a txid, just reply or message me and I'll try to help. doesn't seem like many people care about this kinda stuff right now haha. In the mean time, I found it seems pretty small, but maybe someone there can help you out with the slushpool side of things?
Sorry I can't be of more help!
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:05:58
Segwit2x is different  than segwit. 2x also doubled the block size iirc. Its a garbage alt imo
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:49:29
I'm honestly impressed. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:07:02
Got a lot of walls to break through. Here's hoping they're fake sell walls
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:04:08
So many walls taken out. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:03:11
What about my other questions? make any recent transactions? 
How did you store your recovery seed?
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:09:10
That only you can decide for yourself. I personally just hold
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:52:16
It's all a crap shoot
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:07:28
Yeah a buddy of mine sent bch to a btc wallet Luckily it was to a wallet thst he had te private key to so I was able to help him recover it and sell them. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:54:30
This was posted 20 minutes ago
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:50:01
I posted some stuff on your post in the ledger sub, hope ot helps!
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:21:08
As much as I don't like cnbc:
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:18:11
You coukd use Not sure it does cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:15:03
Got an extra 0 there. I wish it were there. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:40:44
Man,  he's really trying hard
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:44:46
yep, finally got that after his 3rd or 4th response. Why do people do this lol.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:30:20
that is true, I guess people are just willing to buy lower and lower. let's hope this doesn't go too far off the rails. I don't want the general populace to be scared away from crypto forever. but Damn, looking at the market as an outsider must be pretty deterring. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:07:03
Out of curiosity,  which?
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:06:02
All I know is people generally get burnt while trying to day trade.  BTC is a fickle beast, and if you're not on top of it 24/7 and know what you're doing, you will lose money
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:56:48
Hahah Honestly at 1 AM I figured I should just go to bed. I hold anyway, whatever happens happens, ya know?
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:37:37
It's sorted by new automatically
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:56:40
that may be true, time will tell.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:18:57
fair enough. I don't know the first thing about mining. Only thing I ever mined was DOGE back in 2013 hahah. Good luck my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:29:16
That's true, although of they did start I imagine they'd announce it
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:10:55
No one knows for sure, but I'm feeling pretty confident about it. It always drops around Chinese new year then picks up. Also the looming us government shut down might make people but in. 
All that said I must reiterate that this is all speculation. 
Only invest what you can lose
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:17:28
Calm down.
Plenty of tutorials there 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:06:24
that would mean 1 BTC = $100,000,000 we have a while before that happens. but if that ever does happen, we could further subdivide satoshis but that would take a hard fork iirc
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:25:20
Yeah fake walls are super annoying. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:45:05
Take a deep breath, like I said, post over at with a level head.  Describe what you want to do and people will help. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:39:59
Different exchanges will have different prices, hell usually gdax outs the highest for btc
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:29:41
At least on GDAX the BTC volume was like 8-10k over the weekend through last night. Clearly now it sky rocketed. unfortunately in the wrong direction.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:15:36
hey thanks for the gold my friend! I would honestly let this dust settle before thinking about getting back in. You have yourself a wonderful day.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:17:29
seemed like mostly eaten, holy shit it was a sight to behold. Now lets hope everyone keeps this bull running!
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:31:37
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:43:52
I'm no expert. I have no clue really. It just seems like if there's low volume it only take a little bit more volume to make it go in either direction. Unfortunately for us people started selling.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:36:37
Segwit's already implemented, no new coin. Exchanges and wallets just need to start using it. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:15:13
No one can tell you for sure, only thing to do is sit and watch. I personally don't expect much to happen. People who wanted to drop bch for BTC probably already have and vice versa
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:52:07
Sometimes when a wall starts getting into, they'll get pulled. They're just thrown up there for whatever reason.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:53:16
Duh. It's been a long day. Thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:10:57
They never said when, just that they're 'working on it'
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:31:27
Dude, no one knows for sure, and anyone who tells you otherwise is just talking, regardless of charts or technical analysis. You have to make your own choices here. Could it sky rocket? yeah it could. It could also drop more too. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:11:23
might be able to help you. I personally have no idea.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:23:50
yeah it would be nice.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:37:10
I'm pretty sure I saw an 89 at one point, it was insane.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:59:49
inb4 GDAX crashes like yesterday's upswing
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:02:45
Given all these moving walls and low volume on GDAX, is it safe to assume it's mostly been bots trading all weekend?
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:29:01
Ah, gotchya. Forgot it's Monday. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:28:56
could be people/exchanges consolidating inputs
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:22:57
Yeah,  the miners will get the fees. That won't be until we're all dead though 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:23:07
hopefully we get some support soon.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:35:44
that makes sense. pretty crazy seeing ~8k worth just for shits n' giggles. still really cool though. Thanks for this, it's something else seeing it on mainnet like this.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:35:57
Thanks for explaining it much better than I could!
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:55:51
Yeah that's my take too, if no one's buying when a ton of people sell, you have what we got here. Seems to be a fight for 12k right now
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:25:30
I guess reach out to their support. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:24:06
Does gdax even batch txs?
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:38:41
no one can tell you for sure man, go with your gut, don't invest anything that you can't afford to lose. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:48:45
the sidebar has a ton of good info, but generally you sign up for an exchange like Gemini or Kraken. Then you get verified, then you transfer some cash from a bank account, then you buy!
I imagine the exchanges are gonna be having a rough time now though. good luck!
ETA: right depends on your country, what I said applies to the US
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:06:08
Correlation != causation.  BTC generally drops this time of year. I don't think it has much to do with the USD losing power 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:15:07
From what I can tell,  bitconnect shut down and their coin? Ico? Whatever is more or less worthless. People lost  a lot of cash. Gotta be careful when it's one company that affects the value. Jeez
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:16:45
Yep same.  Honestly don't really care too much at this point. lets see how far this thing goes.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:37:16
man these giant sell walls that keep popping up are insane. question is if they're real or not
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:21:28
I'm really sorry man but there isn't anything anyone can do
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:12:13
People afraid of what a government shutdown means for USD,  buy into crypto. Speculation though of course
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:39:58
if we breach it today.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:57:15
yeah that could be true. I know it's a gamble but I'm gonna hold my position and see what happens. I don't think crypto can be killed out right. We'll see though!
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:25:52
just really learned what BCC was, definitely a ponzi. Don't think any one has any recourse on those people
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:41:16
Man just a little volume can swing it a good amount right now, damn
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:41:06
hahah I hear that.  Well, good for them, hopefully they don't lose too much
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:28:57
Were you supposed to link something?
Lightning will reduce user to user fees yeah. opening and closing channels will still happen on chain, but hopefully those fees will be reduced too. We need major players to accept first adopt segwit then LN. It will happen in time I'd say give it 6ish months.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:37:12
that one was largely pulled I think. although I did see 100 get eaten real fast
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:10:01
Is that true? Damn
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:22:55
maybe isolated pumps, who knows.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:50:32
Man that is both awesome and ballsy as fuck. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:08:54
I hear you, but unfortunately they're a small company that just blew up. It's going to take a while for things like that to come around. 
In the meantime there are plenty of people that are willing to help like me. 
Just keep you're wits about you, and if someone contacts you in a PM do not trust them, tons of scammers out there. 
Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:36:46
I honestly can't say. Government workers could go on furlough. Meaning suspended. Could cause a myriad of issued last time this haired was october 2013 iirc, but it only lasted a couple weeks so nothing too serious happened 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:35:55
Jesus and I thought this sub was in panic mode
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:30:38
might wanna try @_date: 2018-01-17 21:36:26
holy shit it happened.
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:56:54
Now we need to hold it 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:00:51
yeah that's true.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:32:27
yeah true, I was more talking about GDAX's resiliency under this kind of load. usually it'd crash and people would rage. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:38:42
no one knows. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:46:01
I dunno man, seems like BTC does have the best dev team.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:09:13
where out of curiosity? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:00:29
Still 'around' it.  If you look at historical charts btc usually drops late Jan then picks up feb/march excluding 2014. Not saying it'll happen again 100%, but there is a pattern there
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:34:22
Good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:00:30
eh at this point it's so low that selling doesn't make sense to me, I'd rather just hold in case it goes back up. but I've been in this since 2013ish so I didn't have a ton invested to begin with.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:27:54
hey at least GDAX hasn't died under the volume for once.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:49:55
I don't put much stock in peoples technical analysis. No one knows what's going to happen
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:48:46
Agreed. Thanks for having a good convo in this hell of people freaking out haha
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:13:55
I think you can just pick normal. I'm not 100% sure though haven't used electrum in a while. 
Although if it doesn't work it's no big deal
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:02:54
I'd buy if I could, unfortunately I already have as much as I can afford in BTC
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:29:44
What happened with bitconnect?
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:56:49
Nope, it's the size of the actual information in the transfer that matters, not the amount of BTC that matters.
Things that affect the size could be how many inputs you have, segwit wallet or not, current # of transactions etc
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:20:08
yeaaaah :/
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:08:56
Looks like they may have updated that: 
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:39:54
Sleep well man haha hopefully you wake up to a better tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:10:05
Lol I think I'm done with forks hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:55:46
Opening and closing channels still have to happen on chain. Also larger purchases (like multiple btc) don't really make sense to do on lightning,  so they will also probably happen on chain. Fees will most likely decrease,  but they still will be there. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:50:19
We aren't out of the woods yet! Hopefully we can keep it above 11!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:46:34
holy shit the last few minutes. better than any tv that's for sure.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:33:29
gone in seconds
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:03:47
Ah,  I guess that makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:45:33
I know Eclair already has a testnet wallet on android. I'm sure many more simple solutions will come in time!
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:07:53
I really wouldn't if I were you. If gdax eats it your coins are gone. Transfer your coins to a wallet you control
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:17:16
If we could stop testing 11k that would be nice.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:54:49
I don't know where you're looking, but it's still here unfortunately
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:36:54
I'm sorry dude, I can't help you, and I doubt anyone's really paying attention to questions like this. maybe slushpool has its own sub that could help?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:16:09
LN isn't that far away. A few brave souls are already using it now. I personally think it's better to try to make the most of what we have now before thinking about a block size increase. Segwit and LN is the start of that.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:31:14
unless it's your address, no. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:46:51
No one knows what's going to happen. anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:37:54
He meant to reply on a thread about some warehouse in Virginia VB is Virginia Beach
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:08:38
well we just blasted through 10k. anything is possible now
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:06:29
Great back to the fake walls game
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:12:03
Woo boy what a thing to wake up to
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:45:12
huh, never actually traded on GDAX, nor have I used those other exchanges. TIL. I imagine there must be some way to raise your GDAX limit, since I see people buying/selling 10s of coins at once. Do other exchanges have silly referral bonuses too? if so I'd stay very far away from them.
Unrelated. Anus Beer sounds disgusting haha
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:08:30
The only one I have any experience with is Coinbase. Lately they have been lagging behind on the tech and therefore their fees are through the roof. The others I have no clue about. Hopefully another Aussie can chime in
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:54:33
I've not seen a wall this big. my god.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:26:12
Nah its gonna have to fight for 12
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:53:19
Alright, almost 1 am here on the rest coast.  Time for bed. Let's see what I wake up to tomorrow
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:51:13
there was a wall of like 720 at 10,200
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:53:10
uh, not really GDAX doesn't have it's own coin and it's not lending your cash to 'someone'  Like I said though, I just learned what it is. there's a huge thing over on where people are talking about it. check it out.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:56:22
I never knew what bitconnect was,  I just took a look at the sub.  Holy shit it's bleak over there
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:32:23
My pleasure bud
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:44:57
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:32:27
now I know I know you're a troll. see ya
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:56:57
Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about the lost BTC. what you can do in the future is protect them better. Did you store them on an exchange? 
In a software wallet on your PC?
did you try to make any recent transactions? if so, did you triple check the address?
How are you storing your back up seed?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:34:03
guys, I'm a long, long time holder but just because it breaks a threshold going up for a second or two doesn't mean it's going to stay there. It's got to fight for it, and can easily drop. save your celebration for when it's stable above a certain point.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:46:37
well, that's misleading as hell. a nano S is a hell of a lot more than a simple USB stick.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:30:34
That would be pretty sweet. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:39:34
Most people seem to not care about the tech. One little piece of 'bad news' and people get all antsy. I dunno what it is this time but I see some people talking about FUD outta India. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:41:17
Most likely bots.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:30:19
Nice, usually GDAX is the highest. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:41:57
Yeah that's pretty much it. I doubt that'll ever happen.  Like I said earlier,  it's not something that'll happen when we're alive. The last bitcoin is estimated to be mined in 2140. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:50:25
yeah that was pretty insane.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:33:07
isn't sunk cost when you invest too much and don't want to abandon it? Like the more I have in, the less I want to abandon?  I'm just saying I really dgaf about it at this point might as well let it ride on the chance that in a year or two it comes back up.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:01:51
On mobile so I can't explain much but watch this:
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:24:41
I would welcome sideways for a while hah
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:38:06
Nice dude! I'm glad things worked out for you! I wish you luck in the future!
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:27:20
Odd worked for me
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:30:50
Fair, not sure about that.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:13:28
Mining or just buying? I honestly don't know too much about LTC.
might be able to help. I'm sure you know this, but I'm going to say it anyway: be careful of people trying to help you in PMs. there are tons of dickheads about waiting to scam newcomers.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:50:25
That was me a couple hours ago haha
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:20:03
shrug, I have no clue what it could be for.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:09:12
Hm Only thing I can think of is that you had some malware and some one was able to get your wallet.dat and maybe a keylogger to get your password. 
That sucks dude, I'm sorry. For an amount that big I'd recommend getting a hardware wallet and using that. It would be much safer. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:42:17
When I was in Tokyo last September, I saw tons of Bitcoin ads. No clue what they said,  but itb was cool
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:39:51
Uh btc isn't an alt
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:31:33
They just put something else as the sticky post. if you search for the daily discussions thread you'll see it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:52:39
I too would like to know this. too bad stuff like this is getting overshadowed by what's happening
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:18:48
Wait wasn't this thread already made this morning?
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:59:33
I honestly doubt a shutdown wound affect much. If anything people might buy in more due to uncertainty of the government. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:10:04
and keeps it right? I hope it does! 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:30:19
Dude,  don't jinx it
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:35:02
I'm chillin' watching GDAX/ this sub go insane. pretty impressive. I'm honestly surprised the 10k wall held this time.
edit spoke too soon about that wall haha
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:55:30
If you're maxing out in the usage, yeah you'll definitely wear your stuff out.  Have you calculated the electricity cost? Generally mining with a regular cpu and gpu is not worth it. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:16:23
I've been in the game a long time, crashes don't matter to me. We'll see what happens if there's a crackdown, but I personally don't think that's going to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:48:53
There's a discussion about this here:
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:29:28
I have read the white paper, and I do have faith, I'm just not over invested. if this goes to 0 I still live and am no worse for wear. if you go to 0 on a mortgage you're boned.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:31:44
It's  a 2nd layer ontop of bitcoin. No new coin needed
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:56:47
Alright, that's just FUD. unless you have a source.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:08:20
man, seeing these walls get eaten in both directions is pretty insane. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:07:06
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:39:28
Once again calm down. 
If you can't search ledgers website,  try
 If you ask politely,  people will help. If you go in with this attitude you're  not going to get anything. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:53:58
Its been holding pretty well for a while
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:21:30
yeah I don't think this is over yet. Hopefully we come out with a few green candle days
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:54:34
ah ok. I wasn't sure. thanks for the correction!
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:31:55
Watching the lightning on mainnet grow is so satisfying. Hopefully nothing catastrophic happens
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:00:48
I have a ledger, and I find it very easy to use.  a trade off is that their code is non-open source to help increase security. Trezor's stuff is open source IIRC so people can see what they're doing and make sure there's no shady shit going on.
From what I've seen/heard both are pretty solid choices. You won't go wrong between those two.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:44:56
yeah we really aren't out of the woods at all.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:46:42
uh Bcash is tanking like everything else.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:36:47
You can't really time the market, don't beat yourself up over it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:03:44
Basically make a new wallet in electrum, and when it prompts you select I have a seed or something like that and enter your words. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:36:48
I dunno I thought I saw some movement there.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:47:37
fair enough, thanks for the info. I wonder what makes them so anomalous.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:45:58
Dunno about btg, I know wallets like exodus and electron  (NOT electrum)  support bch. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:24:55
Alright man, still hope you're a troll. godspeed.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:52:56
I've seen a few real and a few fake myself. 
Man what a day. It's going to be interesting to see where the dust settles.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:50:08
Don't beat yourself up over it. hindsight is 20/20. Good luck my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:09:27
looks like the 10k wall was fake af, but that 9980 one was real and eaten.
edit, one too many 9s I wish it were that hahah
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:41:42
Only time will tell.
@_date: 2019-07-10 09:28:00
Still there 
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:16:42
Basically they issued thier own coin, and you would 'lend' them your money or BTC and they'd give you their coin. you got referral bonuses for the more people you signed up etc.
Not 100% sure how accurate that is since I just learned about them today but yeah, has ponzi written all over it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:32:14
This is pretty cool,  love the stats
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:16:56
that 700+ wall at 11k is daunting. here's hoping it goes down as quickly as the buy one did last night.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:43:46
same boat but in much lower. Let's see where this settles. gonna take a lot of time to recover from this one I think.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:15:15
wouldn't your mom know more?
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:41:30
Never put in more than you can afford to lose dude. Good luck
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:04:09
When you click recieve in your chrome app,  it'll have an address. Copy that and paste it into the gdax send. TRIPLE CHECK the address. Once you're sure it's right,  you're  good to send. 
I cannot stress enough that the address is correct. If you  get that wrong,  you're boned. 
Oh also make sure you choose SEGWIT and NOT legacy. It'll help reduce fees for you in the future. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:38:44
yeah that was pretty infuriating. at least now it seems people can trade when they want to. Now if only we got Segwit and batching support.
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:24:07
Probably because it had nothing to do with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:53:14
What China news this time?
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:39:24
lets see if we can keep above 11k damn that was fascinating to watch.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:16:42
you should have seen the 100 some odd wall that was there earlier.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:00:34
Add it to the obituary list. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:22:03
Sounds like fun, I'd go the flash drive route. Include a readme of how to actually use the btc.
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:27:02
Appreciate you always clicking the link on these so I don't have to waste my time 
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:01:33
It's just a milestone for the LN, pretty cool setting it hit 100 btc
@_date: 2018-09-05 00:33:21
Yep there's a fee. Generally determined by the exchange. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 14:56:02
I bet once the stress test or whatever ends it'll fall back down. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:06:33
Why? You ok bud?
Didn't you say you were out two months ago?
@_date: 2018-09-14 16:35:42
Cake, everybody likes Cake!
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:36:30
I've been trying to find out more about this too. Looks like a bug that has already been fixed,  according to this thread 
Sorry for the mobile link
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:34:24
Where in boston is this?
@_date: 2018-09-22 08:46:35
This has been posted like a million times
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:37:57
It's some bug that was fixed yesterday. I can't find much info about it other than this thread:
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:14:13
Is there A Bakkt FAQ anywhere? 
I wanna understand exactly what it is and why people are so excited about it.
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:44:12
Nice my closest NE warehouse is a few states away from me, so that's not an option unfortunately haha
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:58:33
You're free to use the resulting forked coin if that's the way you feel. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 10:48:19
Asking for upvotes is a great way to get downvotes. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:50:56
That is correct, electrum is a wallet to store coins, not to buy/sell.
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:31:15
I still see it. and only time this sub's daily hasn't been on the front page is when the stickies are other posts which generally only happens if there's some really big/cool/bad news.
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:04:12
Gotta say dude I love you spreading the word.  I'm currently in the process of moving, but once I get my computer all set up I'm gonna give your guide a whirl
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:36:00
IIRC it was pretty doom and gloom until things started climbing back up. people tend to turn on a dime around here.  Not really sure what sparked the turn around. I just held, and continue to do so. To me it's either moon or bust. and My moon is pretty high.
@_date: 2018-08-15 11:25:24
What do you mean again?
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:59:10
Like what?
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:04:04
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:22:32
I actually generally watch Twitch/Youtube stuff more than I do Netflix shows. I don't have cable at all anymore.
@_date: 2018-08-29 10:30:15
How about you don't tell me what to do with my btc?
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:54:42
No problemo
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:08:07
I will say this, predicting the market is tough, if not impossible. How long will this bear market last? Will we bounce with a vengeance? Are we on our way to 0? 
No one knows for sure tbh. I personally think there's a lot of utility here, and we're hearing a lot of good news lately. I think BTC will reach new ATHs eventually, even if it takes a long time.
edit: grammar/spelling
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:44:52
No problem.
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:51:00
I'm bullish on BTC as heck, but yeah, we're testing 6400 now man. Can't be so quick to call bottom like that.
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:03:51
Read the rules, no trading here.
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:36:46
Hey guys! I plan on setting up a lightning node on an RPi 3 soon, like within the next week or two. Is there any one place that's a good resource for how to go about doing that/ FAQs about the lightning network in general? 
I have a good base understanding of it, but I want to dig into the nitty gritty. I took a look over at but their sidebar is pretty sparse.
I'd appreciate any pointers, Thanks!
 I found [This]( and it looks like a pretty decent jumping off point, at least for learning more about the LN itself.
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:50:41
at a real high level, the difficulty adjusts to the hash rate every x amount of blocks. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:14:06
Miners still would collect the fees of the transactions,  so that would be the incentive
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:55:06
So I've been not paying attention to the cryptospace for a while. could you tell me what all this dead babies thing is?
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:25:03
Thanks for the recommendations,  I think I'll take a break from this sub for a bit
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:27:38
That's interesting. Dude's unhinged.
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:49:39
Thank you, I forgot the number. I didn't wanna say something wrong 
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:41:56
Yeah that's basically what I saw. maybe it was manipulation That started raising the BTC:USD, then everyone else FOMOed it to 25k. 
I think now that things like LN are starting to mature, there's actual utility. Hopefully people aren't too burned by this bear market. Only time will tell though.
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:22:54
If you're lucky enough to have a microcenter near you it's worth buying in person sometimes. Ditto with Fry's I've heard. Unfortunately for me, I'm moving away from my Microcenter. They have some killer deals/policies
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:45:24
Just dipped below.
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:19:02
I lurked since around mid 2013. I only comment every now and again here
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:02:37
I wonder why all the naysayers come out of the wood work when btc falls a bit in price. I'd much rather see discussions on the tech. I'm getting tired of coming to this sub. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:23:57
Thanks for the sub!
@_date: 2018-08-30 19:04:41
some one was spamming this link a week ago: 
No clue if it's any good yet though, I haven't watched it myself so YMMV
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:50:27
I'm tired of pretty much everyone who talks about price. Time to take another break from this sub. Maybe permanently if this is all that happens here. 
Hardly anything of value here anymore. 
I wish were more active
@_date: 2018-08-28 15:01:01
Hell yeah, much appreciated friend!
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:57:07
Oh yeah you know it, it's like what happens now, bunch of people say it's gonna go to 0 etc. Then it turned around and people were somewhat surprised.  
I don't know what will happen next, but I think it'll go up. Even if we're in a bear market for a while. I don't mind. My initial investment was very very little.
@_date: 2018-10-17 13:08:35
Not your keys, not your coin would be  for sure
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:44:21
I live so close to there now. I should make the trip up sometime
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:23:11
Yeah it's live on mainnet, but it's still in beta atm.  you can checkout some stats about it [Here](

Ok, so I've been out of the loop on lightning for a while now, what's a good resource on setting up a lightning wallet on a rPi, and is there a good list of who accepts lightning payments?
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:35:18
I can't wait to see what the halvening brings
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:47:24
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:12:48
Thanks! I'm going to try getting my friends into bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:53:26
Nothing is guaranteed dude
@_date: 2019-04-06 07:26:53
I haven't been on this sub in a while so forgive me but VBGD is very big green dildo?
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:41:23
Something about them wanting to 'eliminate mining' same shit different day
@_date: 2018-11-01 10:53:11
It's Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger. One of my favorite movies
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:58:14
Hey man, don't lump all us yanks in with this guy
@_date: 2018-11-01 11:01:20
Posts like this don't help either.  Also @_date: 2018-02-08 01:31:42
yeah, I hope this tether situation amounts to nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:12:16
What news are you talking about? Something new happen?
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:48:30
Unfortunate thing is, once they do get lucky and their TA is good, then they believe it like there is no tomorrow. I agree with you wholeheartedly though, I think it's generally incorrect.
I wonder how much it's a self fulfilling prophecy though.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:09:25
I wish we could see volume on GDAX for certain time ranges.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:48:42
Man that volume on gdax is crazy
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:49:52
Just woke up, on it
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:31:14
Yeah, that's been known for a while. Hell, they stopped for a while then started again.
Still cool nonetheless.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:08:20
Dunno starting to think it might be glitched or something. I just watched 30 BTC change hands in the last minute and it didn't change the number at all.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:18:52
Why I never thought to mouse over them I'll never know. Thanks man!
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:10:02
Eh, I can't fault them for that. it's hard to hold when stuff like that happens. I was only able to because I've seen it before, y'know?
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:45:17
I have not,  what's going on?
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:09:46
Hopefully after that they implement batching. Although it seems they've earned a lot of hate in this sub. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:25:33
Understood. Thanks again!
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:50:32
I mean it's not necessarily fake. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:35:56
I mean, that happened this morning. Could happen again, although with the first decent news in a while, I dunno if we're going to see those levels for a bit unless something negative comes around.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:49:45
yeah, having problems too. I go to log in, get to the point where I quthroize my computer, then it errors out saying I've tried too much today. I've only tried once haha.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:04:25
Pretty interesting that the volume for 24hrs on gdax has been holding steady at 50k for a while 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:06:33
Man the difference in mood between today's thread and yesterday's is night and day.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:19:23
I'm super interested in seeing the segwit percentage once Coinbase fully implements it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:03:54
Looks like something about India.  Turns out nothing really changed and people are just panicking. Just another day
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:31:09
I know what tether is, I was just wondering if anything came out. Nothing has yet apparently.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:41:30
These next couple of walls are going to be a real test. Hopefully they fall.
@_date: 2019-09-05 00:20:04
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:28:32
Just checked now. Below .1
Edit, back above but it dipped below!
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:11:38
Who said we all want kids?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:10:07
GDAX itself, if you look toward the top it has 24 hr volume. 
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:43:48
Sorry impossible
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:18:37
Oh no, poor Clarence.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:25:49
Bitcoin could skyrocket or crash. don't put in anything you can't afford to lose. 
That being said. I dunno where a 16 year old can buy. Maybe coinbase?
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:31:51
I just got through looking at a bunch of them, seems like you can't go wrong with Trezor, keepkey, or ledger nano s.  I just bought the nano S because Trezor + shipping was $130, and the nano was only $71  it didn't seem worth 2x the cost for the trezor
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:53:20
Maybe it was a third party seller? I just checked and I could checkout with BTC

I've seen you do this for a few people. what do you actually do? It's pretty cool of you.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:05:22
Ah, very cool. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:03:48
Also same.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:44:09
Thank you very much friend!
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:23:38
Yeah but as long as nothing was written to the drive, and overwrote that memory location, he could still potentially get it back.
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:56:50
Huh that is strange.  Authy is instant and easy to set up so I highly recommend it. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:20:49
Dude, thanks I just bought 1 BTC from coin base last night and want to stick it in cold storage when I get it next week, I've been looking for how to do this. Thank you.

I'm not sure, I've never tried  to recover something on a drive that had a different file system thrown on it. Honestly if you have  the time to let the program do its work, I'd say it's worth a shot.

Isn't it more like ~2.5-3k?
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:56:14
That makes a lot of sense, solid advice, thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:11:58
yeah I think I'm gonna set up electrum and do an ubuntu USB bootable drive, then probably back  up my wallet to several other thumbdrives/ external HDDs. Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it greatly!
Also, sick user name, Ocelot is the best character in that series.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:33:45
Sweet, I've got a lot of research to do, Thanks!

Alright complete noob here, but  I just bought 1 BTC off of coin base, which I should get in ~7 days.
How do I go about making an offline wallet so I can keep most of it in cold storage?
I assume I'm going to need a 'hot' and a 'cold' wallet.
I'm just unsure of how to actually make those wallets and transfer the bitcoins to them from Coinbase.
I would greatly appreciate some help! :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:25:08
Haha true! hopefully I don't screw it up. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 13:47:58
You and me both! I wish I bought 10 instead of 1 when I did haha.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:28:07
Yeah I agree completely. I just played all of the numbered MGS games two weeks ago for extra life ( you might of saw my post over at now I kinda want to do it again haha
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:09:05
I agree, sounds like a sweet idea. I'm sure once I get all my offline wallet stuff set up I'm gonna have a ton of questions
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:11:42
Do you have a smart phone? You should use the authy app for it, so much easier than texts.
I'm on Verizon, and it did seem to take a while for the texts to pop up, so I switched to using Authy.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:15:00
Electrum huh? I'll have to look into it, Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:15:20
Rule 2:


@_date: 2013-12-12 04:37:25
I think authy can be restored using your email account and/or cellphone number.  I'm not sure if it needs both or not. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:44:35
I assume you've tried every drive recovery tool under the sun then?
