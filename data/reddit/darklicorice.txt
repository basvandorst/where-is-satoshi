Not that the unconfirmed transactions isn't a problem but it hasn't gotten anywhere near 700k, so that's fake news. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:56:06
Okay, so it definitely hasn't done some crazy shit overnight and hit 700k unconfirmed transactions, got it.

Was it really? Big if true. Do you know if there's some unconfirmed transaction history chart I can look at?

If you consider my bag as a wallet and the grocery store as the future of decentralized currency then yes

Yes, when you put btc in your wallet it belongs to your wallet and no one else, protected by your wallet key. When you keep your btc in Coinbase, you're actually keeping it in Coinbase's "wallet", which you do not have they key for.

There is no reason to keep it in there unless you're doing some quick day trading. It is highly advised to transfer your coins out of Coinbase and into a private wallet as soon as you're able. Also, a website is not safe. A wallet is. Coinbase owns your keys- you straight up don't own the money in your Coinbase wallet until you take it out and put it in your own wallet.

Ideally instead of selling them for an alternate currency, we'll be using it as currency.

Thanks for your hard work detective

Yeah but this keyboard goes to 11.

One time they did the same to me. My limit kept dropping from 2k, then 1k, then $500 and then they eventually stopped letting me buy. Never replied to my emails. I ended up just removing the card from the account and re-adding it. They gave me a 3k buying limit immediately. I have no idea what the hell they're doing over there.

I respect it. Good luck on your endeavors.
