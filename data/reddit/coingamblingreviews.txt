It's going to be interesting to watch what these undergrads make of it. If I'd received $100 in BTC as an undergrad I'm pretty sure it would have all been spent in the tavern - lol
@_date: 2014-08-30 11:32:17
I can just see that now! When are we going to stop blaming that Bitcoin CEO in Japan? LOL
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:51:50
I think we are on the same page. There are always opportunities out there for those of us in the right place at the right time :)

This is really encouraging and long overdue! Given how many Bitcoin websites seem to use the Cloudflare service I'm surprised it hasn't happened already...?
Are there any competitors to Cloudflare offering payment with Bitcoin yet?
@_date: 2014-08-19 08:49:16
This really does put everything in perspective! 
@_date: 2014-09-19 10:09:19
This would be funny if it weren't so sad. Bitcoin is going down, down, down :(
@_date: 2014-09-18 08:00:34
It's time to BUY BUY BUY hahaha
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:12:15
If only it was that simple! Fire @ blockchain.info - LOL
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:24:05
Thanks for the great insight! Really, really interesting!

I think it will be interesting to watch how it's received as the barriers to entry become less and less, especially in parts of the world where access to financial services aren't quite so easy. I would love to see this sort of thing happening in Asia (Thailand/Burma) and Africa... I can imagine the results being huge especially in places where individuals find it difficult to get a Visa or Mastercard...

I don't think giving a bible is equivalent to sharing some BTC. I think it's a bit more comparable if a religious person gave you some blessed oil in a small vial or something...
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:14:20
Bitcoin - Like 1996 Internet but with better graphics!
To be honest syncing bitcoind for the first time felt like trying to download a movie on 56k dialup! 
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:49:12
Couldn't agree more! Lobbying is the way forward on this issue.
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:44:12
My fave part of this is the mention of alpaca socks - LOL!
@_date: 2014-08-12 12:35:16
Looks like it is back up again!
@_date: 2014-08-10 17:06:56
I think just turn that into a podcast and build an app that plays it out at random on our smart phones at full volume! LOL
@_date: 2014-08-18 08:06:43
It's a bit like that quote, “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”
If we continue to treat Bitcoin like something it isn't then how will we ever make sense of it in the long run...?
@_date: 2014-08-09 17:54:40
It's an important start!
@_date: 2014-09-18 09:04:37
lol - touché!
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:30:17
This article has a point, it's not TOO late, but I think the opportunities that exist now are much less likely to go HUGE than ideas launched 20~30 years ago... I think with BTC being so new though that there are still some great opportunities in that space for people with the right combo of tech and business skills. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:47:47
Pity the privacy benefits that most of us receive from virtual currencies haven't been extended to that poor bloke :(
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:54:21
A little bit too much excitement can cause all kinds of problems if you're not careful! LOL
@_date: 2014-08-23 03:15:21
I think Bitcoin still really needs to prove itself in the face of a 51% attack before we can say for SURE it is going to be the winner. But I agree with you otherwise!
@_date: 2014-08-08 09:12:04
Couldn't agree more - Bitcoin is so much more than just a way to exchange value. And it brings so many parts of the world, regardless of language/location, onto a more level playing field. Visa/Mastercard might work okay in the Western World, but they're a disaster for most of the developing/third world.
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:58:01
So sexist! 
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:20:21
This is VERY exciting! Thanks for sharing I wonder how long until the ladyboys start taking advantage of it for their geek clientele. It kinda sucks that this didn't happen before the tourist visa rule changes...
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:26:59
Can't this somehow be added into the Escrow system for OpenBazaar?
@_date: 2014-08-09 08:30:06
I'm surprised the growth is so linear - I would have expected it to be more exponential as adoption grows...
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:19:34
Love the Edit, made me LOL!!! hahaha

There is no need for many things that the government does! But that doesn't seem to make any difference to what they actually do :-(
The more lawyers who are elected the more laws we are going to see. It's just like if we started electing vets into Government - animal conditions would change. With lawyers they focus on the laws :(
@_date: 2014-08-08 09:01:42
I'm thinking of companies like Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, etc. Or closer to the 15~20 year mark we have companies like Amazon, Google, etc. 
I don't think opportunities for things like Uber existed 20~30 years ago. Without mobile data and smart phones the utility for something like that is limited. In the same fashion, I doubt Facebook would have been a great success on 56k (omg, imagine how long for those images/videos of cats would have taken to load!) or while we couldn't use Facebook on a device in the bus/lounge/restaurant.

You are the exception, not the rule. But good on you! It's good to hear people celebrating their wins on here, not just feeling bad when their altcoin starts to tumble in value.
@_date: 2014-08-14 09:58:49
Not really with currencies though?
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:17:58
I think as soon as you add face-to-face cash transactions it becomes much tougher to track, especially as on the blockchain a transaction between two computers looks identical to a transaction between bitcoin and cash...
@_date: 2014-08-27 10:13:42
I find the bits versus mBTC versus BTC so confusing. Am I the only one?!?
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:54:24
Let's hope you're right!
@_date: 2017-02-26 04:56:47
Betcoin is really good in my opinion. If you click through my site and email me your username I will give you 75% of the rakeback every month - 
@_date: 2017-02-03 05:08:18
Such a pain in the backside trying to send BTC at the moment!!! So frustrated I sent out these two tweets - 
Any moment now it will all be solved hahaha

Satoshi is wonderful in its' simplicity. I like the satoshi unit :)

He has a non-measurable influence where a percentage of people will follow his direction.

2 pieces of paper split in half with the private keys. One in location x and one in location y. Ain't nobody stealing my bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:54:16
Of course people are doing this, why not? It's like wall street without the SEC! 
@_date: 2017-01-29 12:00:55
fair enough.

Have a look at our Bitcoin gambling Investments Blog, We have been doing very well so far! - 
@_date: 2017-01-28 04:40:25
haha the pain is real :(
@_date: 2017-01-28 04:41:25
Awesome idea! Might do it in my office. Although will need to be $10 or so due to the increasing tx fees...
@_date: 2017-01-28 04:42:57
Colombia it is illegal - where did this mis-information?! 
@_date: 2017-01-29 12:04:26
After 6 months it has been an interesting experiment. A lot of the returns have been from the rise in Bitcoin but still there has been some great returns from the dice sites as well. 6 more months to go so hopefully the trend continues :)
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:52:21
someone will just create another platform people can leverage the hell out of BTC and trade... 
@_date: 2017-01-29 11:52:35
I hope so!
@_date: 2017-01-28 04:43:25
nails it!
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:55:50
Might not be good but its a hell of a ride!
