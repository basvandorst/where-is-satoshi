Exactly! But I want to be in CLASS with that guy! To learn, in person, from him! I want to know and be around him if I'm getting a Masters!

I wonder if it's better to just get a degree in economics from Nicosia and take their BTC classes integrated? If this was a live program I'd seriously consider it. If it's just internet then I'll learn by myself honestly.

What an incredible post! I love your last suggestion that we all practice this with our own passions! Inspiring

from a beginner , thank you for a simple answer. Satoshi is the elusive founder of the system yes? and he might be a white guy in Australia? I know these are fundamentals but I bet there are a ton of people on here afraid to get their 101!

please go on. what's a non-legitimate service that you would use to buy bitcoin. Also, why? As a person that sees BTC being used for everything in the future, I'm investing in the idea of its practical use. I'm not using it to make illegal purchases. 
Am I off on the deep end here? Thanks

On the subject of anonymity : I recognize that many investors in BTC have anti gov't ideologies to begin with but do people also want to remain anonymous so they can make illegal purchases and such?
And how much do you buy on average? Do you purchase 1 share each time you buy or do you buy little bits of 1 and accumulate over time?

I would love to know how much you (or people) buy every week. I know that's going to be different for everyone, but let's say i'm a beginner and I want to invest steadily over the next year. I could afford 500 dollars a month. best way to go about it? 125 a week?

now I'm familiar! seriously, anything that comes to mind please post, all of this is much more personalized direction than the FAQ

thank you! 
The second part is especially helpful and I will be researching breadwallet/copay and also how to make a paper backup . 
I am still interested in the stock market part of this entire equation... Let's say I have 1 bitcoin and then ETF's like the Twins start to pop up on the NYSE. Would investment in those ETF's boost the value of that 1 bitcoin I own? 
Here's another question - If I buy something in Bitcoin, can I spend .25 of 1 bitcoin for the purchase? So if something cost 175$ are there companies and services accepting *parts of 1 whole bitcoin as payment?  
thank you thank you

Now that I've had a chance to sort through the ideas here, I'm wondering if most beginners just use coinbase and breadwallet combo? Am I getting that straight?
Interested in the bitsquare.io but still not 100% how it even works...

any idea what a bitcoin could potentially be valued at?
Could a bitcoin be worth 1 MIL dollars one day? Any articles discussing this I would love to read

Happy to get straight answers. thanks for the link

if I touched a nerve then please excuse me. also I can see how naive I am in understanding the application of this system. Will look more into bitsquare and my private financial economics. 
And yes, we completely agree about gambling :)
