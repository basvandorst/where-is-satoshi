In that case, it’s impossible. In this field, trust is everything, and selling a purely electronic record to a new customer who’s using a payment instrument whose charges can easily be reversed is a very bad idea.
You need to build up some trust with some exchange to be able to buy bitcoins with any speed.

*You* must be joking. Here are the facts:
* 0.000000014% of the population (one person) owns 6% of the entire bitcoin supply.
* 0.014% (about a million people, and this is a high estimate) of the population own any bitcoins at all.
* 99.985% (6.999 billion people) of the population own zero bitcoins.
Extrapolated to the population (320 million) and wealth (70 trillion) of the United States, that would be similar to:
* One person having a net worth of $4.67 trillion.
* 45,000 people having a combined net worth of $65.3 trillion, or about $1.45 billion each.
* 319.9 million people having zero net worth.
You’re delusional if you believe bitcoin is “fair” in terms of wealth distribution… unless your idea of “fair” is to *become* one of those “evil bastards” that you claim to hate.

Do you mean “the Lightning Network”? That’s hardly an improvement over Bitcoin itself. It’s like buying gift cards for each place you shop at — with additional transaction fees — and loading them up with lots of money to avoid other transaction fees. It definitely isn’t free, and based on the (yet to be finished) whitepaper it isn’t much cheaper, if any cheaper at all.

Sorry, but that isn’t the definition of “spam” by a long shot. If miners were only to include transactions that were only agreed to by every node on the planet, the entire network could be taken down by a single node.

That’s a naïve way of thinking. The truth is, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act specifically indemnifies ISPs from what their customers do as long as they cooperate with any court order. Lawyers for both the prosecution and the defense will demand computer logs to either prove or disprove the case. I can guarantee you that Comcast cares more about their bottom line than you, so they will be more than happy to provide enough evidence that basically says “we didn’t go to those sites, we just routed requests for them from this customer”.


Nothing explicitly prevents you from seeking “reseller level internet services”. Expect your Internet utility bill to increase by several orders of magnitude, though. Also, I hope you have a lawyer on retainer.


Yes. ISPs can tell when different computers are sending different pieces of traffic through one IP address. Hardware to do this has been available for years. This is how cellular phone providers can detect if someone is tethering their phone to a laptop when it’s forbidden in their AUP guidelines.


Buying a different plan from your ISP does not indemnify you for your “customer’s” actions unless you happen to be performing all of your commerce through a legally set-up corporation. You may also want to use that lawyer I suggested earlier to make sure all the data you gather doesn’t violate any privacy law, but that you get enough data to ward off any legal culpability, and that you provide a giant wall of text to keep customers from arbitrary suing you for cutting short their cat videos.

@_date: 2015-12-13 00:55:50
This depends on your definition of "bitcoin collision":
 * If you mean “where more than one blockchain exists”, then the probability is 1. This has already happened.
 * If you mean “where two transactions, each having the same input but having a different output, are accepted into one block”, the probability is 0. One or the other may get in, but not both.

Maybe you should stop glorifying a pillhead sociopath just because part of his business involved bitcoins? Contrary to what you believe, I did “some reading”. Here’s the spiel that gets thrown around whenever your poor baby Ross is mentioned:
 1. He made drugs safer, somehow. (Contrary to popular believe, drug dealers don’t kill customers. No dealer of anything kills their customers. They may keep them addicted, like with the tobacco or alcohol industry — but the last thing a dealer wants is to have their source of income die.)
 2. He "just ran a website". (Again, not true. He got a cut of all the money that was spent on his website.)
 3. That whole fucking murder-for-hire thing. I almost never see someone who’s pro-Ross argue that he *didn’t* order a Mafia-style hit. They either claim it was role-playing, or that he did it under duress, or that he did it but it isn’t a crime because none of his convictions specifically mention murder. (These excuses range from absurd to dubious.)
Note the complete lack of bitcoin in that list. I see two reasons why people here defend Ross: they either think he is being persecuted solely for using bitcoin (not true), or they think his persecution is causing investments in bitcoin to lose value (definitely not true). If anything, the association of Ross Ulbricht with bitcoins merely makes the entire community look like pillheads looking for a way to buy pills. The sooner Ross is disregarded here, the better off the community will be.

That does not make selling drugs safe. The US government performed lots of atrocities in the past, and some say even in the present. Does their involvement with said atrocities suddenly make them less bad? Be rational.


That’s a dubious claim, at best. All Ross did was change the way people buy drugs. Frankly, I would avoid his market even for pot — I don’t want my dealer knowing my address.


So, you’re making presumptions about me, but you denigrate me for making “presumptions” about Ross. Nice.


Did I trigger you? Did I encroach upon your safe space, where heroin is harmless and drugs only do bad things if you don’t buy them online?
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:08:33
I was being sarcastic, but thankfully (for Ross) the United States won’t extradite people if there’s a chance that they may be executed for anything other than murder.
If Ross Ulbricht **had** been convicted *in absentia* by a Singapore court, and if the United States were to get a nice benefits package from Singapore (read: a free military base and a customer for 30-year bonds at 0% interest) they might have sent him over to be hanged or shot.

When banks put up money to pay the old mortgage off, they use deposits to do so, and as you pay off the new mortgage the money you pay goes to the depositors.
The only difference I see is that, when refinancing a mortgage, the buyer of the debt (the bank) gives you an interest rate before the debt instrument (the mortgage) is issued. When the U.S. Treasury issues debt, it sets an interest rate it thinks creditors want, but the effective interest rate is determined by how many people bid on the debt.
Considering the short-term debt that the Treasury is issuing has an effective interest rate of nearly 0%, and isn’t required to be paid in foreign currency, the panic in OP’s news article is hardly justified.


Technically, money creation is left up to the Federal Reserve. The Treasury doesn’t make money, and the only money they *could* make would have to be minted on gold, silver, or platinum coins. (This is where the “trillion dollar coin” idea came from when Congress wouldn’t “raise the debt ceiling”, which is an odd term meaning “give them money to pay off their current debts.”)

Irwin Schiff was a victim of his own beliefs. His first attempt at avoiding taxes began with him working at an insurance firm, where he moved his clients money -- and his own money -- into a "tax shelter" that ended up being a Ponzi scheme. (He lost everything.)
Schiff is no huckster; he's actually very well educated. The problem is that he morphed the idea of tax avoidance from a science into a quasi-religion. Most professional accountants would blame a lack of due diligence on falling for a Ponzi scheme. Irwin Schiff blamed the government. According to him, if income taxes didn't exist, he wouldn't have been motivated to send money to the fraudulent tax shelter.
In "United States v Schiff" (2006), Schiff's lawyers argued that their client was legally insane. Granted, that's probably not true and is merely a legal defense, but it makes you think.
Peter Schiff's debit card is a ripoff, by the way:
* [You're paying a 4% premium to make a deposit.](
* [There's a yearly fee to merely hold a balance in silver.](
* [To "cash out" your debit card, you need a balance of at least $10,000.](
Compare this to Amagi Metals:

Before you get a deluge of comments from people telling you to store your bitcoins on a deterministically generated BIP0038 encrypted paper wallet, let me as you a few questions:
1. Do you also want to buy bitcoins at a fixed price using this service?
2. Do you also want a merchant option to accept bitcoins with your online business?
3. Do you also want to be able to convert your bitcoins to dollars quickly?
If you answered “yes” to question 3, go with Xapo and their debit card. If you answered “no” to question 3, but “yes” to any of the other two questions, go with Coinbase. Otherwise, store them on a paper wallet.

False; it was always defined as 12 ounces of silver, and that silver didn’t have to contain any more than 90% silver by weight. (Silver bars, rounds, and coins nowadays are typically at least 99% pure.) The “16 ounces = 1 pound” standard is the avoirdupois pound.

Of course, if they move all of their assets to New Zealand, FATCA won't affect them. If a Chinese national emigrating to New Zealand decides to buy assets or investments in the United States, the U.S. Treasury is obligated to respond to any requests from the NZ tax authorities about said assets or investments.
I believe a Chinese national would be more concerned with their destination country's extradition treaties (specifically, they want a country with no treaty with China) before looking at the portion of the country's tax law concerning foreign asset reporting. They would then consider the ease of purchasing real estate, then look at political stability, the cost of living, the education system, the existing Chinese diaspora, and several other factors.

I'm presuming that any Chinese immigrants will also move their money into a U.S. based bank or credit union, which would exempt them from FATCA. (If you think American banks are bad, try a Chinese one.)
Also, New Zealand is one of the countries that has an agreement with the U.S. to report foreign assets, so that wouldn't really help. If you know of a Chinese national who wants to avoid FATCA, you should forward them this list of countries that are reporting to the U.S. Treasury:

Payment networks already exist with near-instant transactions, and they can work with any kind of money, even gold. (I still remember eGold and their competitors.) They’re just centralized. As long as people trust the centralized network, they will still use it. Conversely, as long as people trust bitcoin nodes, they will still use bitcoin.
The main need for bitcoin comes from the desire for a decentralized version of what Western Union provides: a way to transfer money to other people with minimal paperwork. The company *Final* does something totally different: it extends credit to a consumer by using a one-time number exchanged between the customer and the merchant instead of using a reusable number that could be later used for an unauthorized purchase.
The main feature that credit cards provide — the ability to finance something instantaneously — will never apply to bitcoin, just like how it never applied to Western Union.

The short-term value of one bitcoin depends on the demand for sending and receiving money without having to give out bank details. This includes buying things from stores that take bitcoins but immediately cash them out.
The long-term value of one bitcoin depends on the supply of products that can be bought with one bitcoin. This only includes buying things from stores that only accept bitcoin.

No massive amount of wealth distribution has ever taken place by simply issuing new money.


This is the distribution of global wealth in bitcoins:
 * 0.00000001% of the world’s population owns 15% of the world’s bitcoin supply.
 * 0.0029% of the world’s population owns 85% of the world’s bitcoin supply.

Divide 25 by the total supply and you’ll get the monetary inflation between blocks, which is on average every ten minutes. You make it look tiny, but it’s huge: assuming the same 10 minute average block time and 25 bitcoin reward, that’s ≈ 1.3 million bitcoins introduced to the money supply yearly on top of the existing ≈ 13.7 million bitcoins that exist.
Take [block  for example. It contains 2342 transactions. The total amount of transaction fees paid is 0.29818335 bitcoins, but the miner gets 25.29818335. For the miner to get that same reward without any subsidy, each transaction would have to pay an additional 0.01067463 (that’s 25 ÷ 2342) on average. For [this large transaction]( that’s a negligible 0.01% fee, but for [this small transaction]( that’s a 69.1% fee. I could replace the flat 0.01… fee I calculated with a percentage-based fee, but I’d still have to increase the fee by 8484.1% (25.29818335 ÷ 0.29818335). And I’m using a *very large* (nearly one megabyte) transaction in this case.
The subsidy in the Bitcoin network, like any other subsidy anywhere, does artificially mask the true cost of a transaction. This isn’t some anti-Bitcoin rant; it’s simple economics.

There isn’t anything wrong in general with drawing parallels between one event and another. I never suggested that.


It isn’t meant to make my argument the winning one. Making such extreme comparisons makes one’s argument look bad. MemoryDealers compared the trial of Ross Ulbright to the throwing of a Jewish person into an oven. If MemoryDealers took the other side of the argument, and if he said something along the lines of “Ross commanded a person to be killed, and Goebbels did the same thing, therefore Ross is a Nazi,” you would have immediately pointed out the fallacy in his argument. Unless either Ross or the prosecuting attorneys are actively engaged in a genocide, comparing *either* of them to the Nazis is a silly analogy.

I **did** answer the original question. You just didn’t like the answer, which was:
 1. Centralize the service.
 2. Have one server verify everything.
 3. Have the central server replicate the data.
When any organization is given the choice between setting up a decentralized database versus a centralized database, they will always choose the latter. In an organization where the entire system is under their control, there is no need for proof-of-work: the organization *is* the central authority.
With bitcoin, the miner who guesses the correct hash becomes the central authority for one block only¹. If you have the hash power, you have a better chance of being the person to verify the last ten minutes of transactions.
Now, you mentioned the possibility of transaction collisions. The block chain doesn’t provide any way to prevent this. It’s up to the nodes, who may or may not be miners, to read the block chain and see if a transaction contains a valid input and valid output, and to reject invalid transactions². Only when a miner finds the correct hash does a transaction become truly valid.
This isn’t fast, but it works. For NASDAQ, who wants something fast, this system simply won’t work. That’s why the bitcoin memory pool isn’t filled with stock trades: it’s too slow to verify, among other problems.
¹ This is disregarding when one pooled miner gained 51% of the hash power.
² There is an ongoing issue with the bitcoin network where a transaction can have two valid hashes.

Again, this is a centralized system. Every transaction comes one-at-a-time, as far as the system is concerned. The central system controls what is replicated and where it goes, and it does it very quickly.

The two biggest countries that use bitcoin are the United States and China. The idea of a pay toilet is absurd to most Americans, and if a person in China can’t find, or pay for, a toilet, he or she just pisses and shits on the ground.
Plus, there’s the 10 to 60 minute confirmation time.

You’d think there would be a modicum of evidence showing the existence of some group of “vested interests”.
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:11:48
That makes no sense. Are you suggesting that Ross Ulbricht was the Harriet Tubman of the Internet?
@_date: 2015-02-27 03:56:42
…and misspelling a man’s name will will stop all of that “selling out [of] the foundations of American prosperity and prestige”. Obviously.
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:05:21
That doesn’t make their money disappear.

Your rant (as you put it) looks like a word salad that barely relates to this sub’s main topic.
Also, don’t answer a question with another question. It’s rude.
@_date: 2015-10-20 22:49:23
It doesn’t.
The whole “Lightning Network” proposal, along with “sidechains” and probably some other buzzwords, are simply nice ways of saying “centralization”.
@_date: 2015-11-22 08:10:42
Again, Ross could have simply declined, but he didn’t. The “threat” to him was merely to his business, and a threat to one’s business is no reason to act violently.

…as long as you didn’t make Ross Ulbricht more paranoid. Then he’d have you killed.

In England, maybe. As long as the reporter honestly believed he was Satoshi, there’s no court case in the USA.

You won’t call them and ask why they hate freedom?

How can you sue for merely being reported on?

“Hackers steal … Bitcoin not involved”
So, Bitcoin theft has now become so prevalent that a non-Bitcoin theft story is news? 😔
@_date: 2015-02-09 04:55:58
Amazing. I don’t even think it’s possible to cram more buzzwords in that first sentence.
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:38:08
Name the law that protects you from your local cable or phone company outright blocking access to the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:19:39
What kind of benefits, exactly?
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:58:52
How is what I wrote “stupidity”? There’s already a stereotype of people who post here being cult-like, and posts like OPs just reinforce that stereotype.
Your silliness leads me to believe that you’re the one who is brigading for here.

What pills are you on?

I don’t recall banks giving out piggy banks. I could be wrong, though.

Neo &amp; Bee has been subjected to the same punishment as Mark Karpeles and Ryan Kennedy: **absolutely nothing.**

Not unless every one of those pseudoscience presumptions involve the calculation of a SHA256 hash.
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:31:02
Did I upset you?
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:25:17
You mean a piggy bank?
@_date: 2015-10-14 04:02:32
Do you even know what “bagholder” means?
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:45:43
Wow, so you check the history of every person who replies to something you write — and you throw *ad hominem* attacks at them? That’s just plain sad.
For your sake, please try coming up with a meaningful reply.
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:42:23


Damn, you got him good. I didn’t believe your argument for a single second until you misspelled the guy’s name. I guess President Obama is totally perfect except for his name, right? You must have stayed up all night coming up with that comeback, you edgy comedian.
@_date: 2015-02-17 00:33:02
So, they *aren’t* paid.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:10:39
I didn’t attack you. I asked what pills you were on. You could have gone down the high road and said something like “I’m not on any pills”, but instead you decided to be an Internet tough guy.
Have you come up with a meaningful reply yet?

Don’t subject any child to this. I don’t recall anyone writing children’s books about the Federal Reserve, so let’s not go down the path of child indoctrination.
