I just posted this in another USDT thread, but I'll put it here too.
Tether is clearly shady, and at the very least it's being used heavily by money launderers. That seems like a very plausible reason why Tether might be so slow to release an audit even if they're holding all the USD they're supposed to be.
Of course it could be a massive scam, but it's not clear to me how 1.6B of fake money disappearing takes a 500B market down. USDT does account for 8.5% of the entire crypto market volume, and Bitfinex is the highest volume BTC market in the world so I guess it could do a lot of damage.
But still, I don't see why it shouldn't be legit. The idea that it's being printed to 'prop up' BTC's price seems less likely to me than the more obvious one: when the market hits bottom, the demand for converting fiat goes up. BTFD.
To me it just seems easier for Bitfinex to 'print money' by continuing to operate as the biggest market in the world. This scam doesn't seem like something they'll easily get away with, though greed has made worse decisions.
It also makes more sense for Tether to be a scam if you think cryptocurrency is illegitimate. Most people, including many of those invested in BTC, still don't understand why it has value. Those people, many of them new investors or new potential investors, are extra likely to believe and spread the Tether FUD. I can't say they're wrong about Tether, but I'm certain they are wrong about the value of BTC.

It's happening?

I happen to believe bitcoin and at least some other cryptos have an obviously bright future. I realize there are risks and am not even close to 'all in' in terms of what I do with my savings, but I probably have more in crypto (~10-15%) than most skeptics would consider sane.
That said, read [this book.](
Great resource on crypto's space in a portfolio. Risky assets can make a portfolio less risky via diversification. [Here's]( a random article I googled on the same idea. I did not read all of it nor do I vouch for it :D

Read this book: 
Helped me learn tons about traditional investing, and of course crypto.

Suspended does not mean permanently.

I believe it was a mistake, but a bitcoin.com partnership isn't much better. They're the number one perpetuator of this total lie.

They are also deceiving their own customers and all crypto users. They are very, very bad form. You don't have to work with them. Your public stance on this seems very different than your actions here.

Haven't watched the Tom Lee vid (though I will, thanks for posting) but I agree with this guy that generational categorization is arbitrary bullshit.
Love this take on it:

I swear it used to say this in their FAQ, though I can't find it now. Hopefully withdrawals are allowed or I won't be using it.

Ahha.. that makes sense. I imagine it would be basically impossible to send 0.04 more than a hop or two right now anyway.

I don't know about the Milan Summit, but the maximum channel size is definitely 0.16777216 on the live network currently. You can see this node for instance has opened many .16777216 capacity channels:
