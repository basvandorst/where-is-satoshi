I'm just wanting to find out how to do it at the moment. I haven't put any funds into it.
It seems like a neat additional security feature but I want to make sure that the reversing is also easy and straight forward.

An empty example I did to test it:
This is a random address I generated using paper wallet:




However then when I generate with BIP38 enabled I get these results:




Then when I go to bitaddress.org &gt; Wallet Details &gt; Paste encrypted key first (this seems to trigger that decrypt shows instead of encrypt) &gt; Use the passphrase which in this example is abc it gives me these results:

So essentially a situation where:
1. Someone needs access to the laptop then sneaks in and replaces my USB drive with one he made but that also includes some logging feature.
2. This same person then comes back e.g.: 2 months later and changes the USB back to the original one and then takes the one with logs?
If that's the case it seems like it'd be easier simply stealing the paper wallets?
Also what would the risks be of say running it on Ubuntu installed on the hard drive or SSD and running a saved copy of bitaddress.org assuming the laptop is never connected to the internet directly? Is cached data on the drive somewhere in temp files and physical theft the concern here?

Do you mean locking away just the laptop or the laptop and the printer?

Central bankers will continue to call any crypto-currency a scam even when it has 99.97% market share.

Pretty top tier meme.
Would only be improved by some people on the right who listen to 'the news' and are about to jump off the ride after they set it on fire themselves (as though that changes anything on a log ride and will do anything but superficial darkening).

Buy step-dad a BitCoin.
Watch old people get super hip on new technology.
2 years later at the dinner conversation HODL is the most used word.
