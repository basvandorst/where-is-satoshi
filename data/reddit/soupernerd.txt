Ouch. Seems like blockchain tech and the internet might not have only saved lives, but saved wealth and having to be physically transported.

BTW, thanks for the downvotes to push this to negative. You guys are the best lol. Dont ever let anyone tell you different..
Although with the sub being set to sort based on controversy, I might make it on top! woo!

Im not much of a gamer myself but my wife is a hardcore android gamer on her galaxy tab s.
The smurfs &amp; Criminal Case are her fav.
Now if smurfberries could be exchanged for bitcoin or were bitcoin itself... she might actually understand bitcoin.

This sounds subjective. Can you clarify what would be considered valid vs invalid?




Without clarity of what you consider valid, no one even knows what that means. Are we talking "Bitcoin Core Developed" valid?
I think it would also help a lot to know your definition of:
* consensus


They have stated they are interested in staying ahead of the curve, and their interest with running various clients is to make sure they have a clear understanding of potential outcomes.


There is a consolidation problem at this very moment with bitcoin mining in general. Its not *client* specific at this point in time.

Whether it be lack of QA, lack of funding, lack of experience, lack of devs up to the task.
Its time to rethink "anti core" bias. As of right now, there is no other dev team with pertinent funding, experience patience and foresight.

I stand behind this persons ban.
Follow it back (parent) as long as you'd like. This wasnt censorship, this was moderation.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:41:58
Put 2FA on EVERYTHING.
Its not only hackers you want to protect yourself from, its sites themselves.
So for instance, one attack could come from a site itself. Specifically looking for usrs with a bitcoin balance yet no 2FA.
This presents an opportunity for bad acting sites and services to take from the user while waving off any perceived responsibility.
Sorry that this happened to you.
@_date: 2016-01-27 04:51:40
Youre framing what has happened incorrectly imo. If the community would have been allowed to speak about xt on r/bitcoin eventually they would have gotten it out of their system.
The reason that xt posts even exploded was due to the fact people didnt appreciate being silenced.
Also... I see know posts about xt on r/btc's front page nor its new page. Imagine that.
Say what you will about r/btc, buts its just your opinion. If you ever find yourself on the other side of being censored, Im pretty sure you would be crying foul.
If another dev team and client are adopted by users and miners, would it then be okay for anyone to remove all talk of core under the guise that somehow its an altcoin or any other reason? I have no doubt you would be a bit more sensitive about the situation at that point.

Doesnt matter if this account was sold or not.
This is one of those instances where this account could have been sold and the information posted through this account either makes sense to those reading... or doesnt.
Two sep issues.
This account is currently saying that core devs have been thoroughly tested, beaten upon, shilled against and completely thrashed yet they have held steady.
Maybe its time to acknowledge that they have some sort of plan vs hand waiving anything they have to say or put forth just because of personal bias.
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:16:21


So your nightmare scenario is AFTER something breaks? What could go wrong lol.
Guys, its fine.. its not a nightmare yet..
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:13:41
Initially we were allowing zero day accounts, but people took it too far and are using it to be jerks.
Seems some think its okay to treat others badly at the flip of a switch, they create new accounts they dont care about, that have no history.
Not everyone who creates zero days does this but after weeks of watching it, it was 8 out of 10 zero days that abused others.

OMG if a large newscorp wanted to play bitcoin insider trading, they could do so much more damage than this...
Aside from the ETF, they could promote, discredit, introduce bitcoin without having to post on a certain topic and win.
Im happy that this hasnt been a problem to date but maybe some out there should scour recent articles to make sure.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:04:26
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:53:40
Yeah well, when you weigh the pros and cons against a dev team you may not agree with that may be up to the task vs a dev team you agree with, yet seem to lack the talent required to take bitcoin to a new level...
At some point you have to just give credit where credit is due.
BU dropped the ball and no matter how hard one may have rooted for them, it shouldnt cloud the facts that have recently come to light.
We should probably also take into account that if I am indeed the "former moderator" of r/btc, it was from a postion of allowing discussion, not so much against the core dev team. Two sep issues that over time became clouded.
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:39:19
Piece of advice. The less time you spend on reddit in regards to bitcoin, the smarter you are.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:45:05
Im convinced if theymos had just simply allowed discussion of xt (which Im not really partial to personally) the community would have got it out of their system, looked into it and decided "yeah... neh"
Instead it snowballed and (most likely) will ultimately lead to the community switching clients and dev teams. Its only a matter of time before someone hits it out of the park with a client proposal...


Is there a *discussion* though?
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:07:23
if the resulting html has a redirect in it, you can remove it.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:07:39
Thank you for responding btw.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:02:48
That is a fair point.
What happens if running a channel becomes the equivalent of running a private tracker.
Will large legit companies take the risk? Or will they announce intentions and possibly become compliant?
If they become compliant this brings on the third question: Will they then be able to censor my transactions based on government guidance or lists?
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:52:44
Thank you both. Any other views on it you two?
Anyone else?
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:52:45
Okay Im wondering because exchanges that deal in crypto/crypto seem to think this is important.
For instance poloniex at most deals in usdt which is just another crypto, yet poloniex is either forced or has chosen to push forward kyc/aml.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:28:31
Right, but the law already exists and could already be enforced on companies. For instance localbitcoins.
I sort of agree with you it could possibly be a grey area, but Im not sure just yet myself.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:26:43
Well thought out especially considering this is such a complex idea as a whole.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:21:53
I was heavy into torrent scene creating the php for the first private tracker. I can say that they put those boys through hell.
I use private trackers so I havent kept up with tpb, or who runs it now.
Still I cant help but to think equity/liquidity becomes a problem without legit/compliant channel operators. I know they will exist.
However, now we are talking kyc/aml basically canceling out them really wanting to get involved due to non interest potentially from the userbase, which brings us right back to the equity problem in everyman/dark channels.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:06:11
This is completely true from my perspective.
This brings on a different question though, what about large legitimate companies with liquidity or better yet, equity?
Is liquidity/equity a problem in this scenario?
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:18:33
That is a bright spot in my day. Id like to see more of this.

So you sent bitcoin to generated bip38 protected paperwallets before printing those bip38 protected wallets to pdf? or paper? or taking a screenshot? or copying and pasting anything from those bip38 wallets to... say.. notepad?
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:52:24
He may find the paperwallet image but he wont find any of the data populated.
Just a blank paper wallet picture.

You know what you said.
Here is the link to the comment that got you banned, you deleted it, perhaps you would like to be honest and tell everyone what it actually said.
Maybe everyone likes having their time wasted with the "Supported theymos. Said i agree with him" lie.

Looks like you got manginahunter to pull the ole "I cant be racist, I have black friends" card too.

The new link is just an upgrade of the old one. Both links are provided by the same modlogging service.
They sent us the updated link, so I updated the link in the sidebar.
@_date: 2016-07-26 04:16:22
automod is there too.
if you do a ctrl f and search for automod, its there.
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:35:15
Happens I guess. I will edit my previous to remove a certain statement.
This shows it also: 
And each automod action gives a reason on both sites.
