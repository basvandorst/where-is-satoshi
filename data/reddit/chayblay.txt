Do you mind sharing your advice for newbies to crypto trading and perhaps the background story to your success?

I appreciate the philosophical answer to the question and the lesson of how he got where he is. But one does not simply succeed at investing in cryptos via buy and hodl right? Thats not a comprehensive strategy especially with the relatively higher potential for the bubble to burst. Also, there’s so many other ways to not just hodl but reinvest, transact across borders, consult on the side, etc. One of the biggest attractions to Bitcoin is how accessible it is to anyone and how much money can be made, and yet the somewhat overwhelming lack of structure to all of the information, learning and trustworthy education curriculums (which can be said for most lucrative ventures on the web). I’m always looking to broaden the conversation to open people up to communally sharing practical investment tips as well as framing the entrepreneurial mindset to capitalize on new  possibilities. Barring the scammers and hackers out there, it’s always beneficial.

If your coins are in an exchange wallet and the exchange chooses to support the wrong chain, do your coins lock up or will they allow you some time to transfer to a different wallet?

I know about S2X fork in two weeks but coulda sworn I heard another announcement for Nov 1. Still could be good to lock in gains right before the next fork

Aren’t you supposed to hold your BTC in the exchanges during the offering period (fork) of free BCH matching?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:17:22
Wat happened when you left your USD on the exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:51:35
There was supposed to be a fork today, this is prolly just a pump from people who want free coin. Might be a good place to lock in your money and btfd soon
