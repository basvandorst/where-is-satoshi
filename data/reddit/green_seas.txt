Not trying to be a dick, but now that you made the typo twice, I HAVE to ask:
Why type "ass-off", not "ass off"? Are you under the impression its one word?

mass printing of USDT you say?

Not true. That depends on your heuristic function (if you're implementing something like A-star). For example, an algorithm that seeks to minimize number of channels (obviously that could be suboptimal) would be unaffected by changes in fee structure.
P.S. my hope for crypto is that it gets people interested in real computer science, instead of shit ico scams

The difference here is the UTILITY you get from each service. Doom's value comes from the entertainment it provides. What utility does bitcoin currently bring other than speculation, or at best, braving hackers and scammers for the privilege of...using a suboptimal payment method?
For the record, I believe in cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks, just these valuations are completely out of touch with reality.
