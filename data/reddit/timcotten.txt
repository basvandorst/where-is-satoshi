The JFSA's reaction is predictable - I'm surprised they had not issued clearer guidance earlier.
Is there a Japanese blockchain advocacy group? I used to live there myself but am out of touch with the Japanese Bitcoin/blockchain community.
Are there any privacy oriented crypto-currencies founded/run in countries that can't/won't legislate against them (e.g. the Caymans)?

If you look at the network hash rate it's dropped proportionally as well: down to 25,955,157.85 TH/s and correlating to an intrinsic energy cost of $3,806 per coin (
That's close to the low it had before the conference pumped up mining interest and speculation.

The problem with nation-states adopting crypto as a currency is that they prefer predictable and stable inflation - not deflationary coins with wild speculative swings in value.

This is the correct response to this sort of proposal. There's no need to artificially "seize" coins.

I would suggest a few off the top of my head:
* ERC: you define ERC20, how about explaining what an Ethereum request for comment is? (RFC, and EIP as well)
* Hash: you have hash rate, how about the definition of a hash
* SHA256
* Yellow Paper

There'll be a culling of sorts, sure. But people also try to recoup their losses with long-shot bets on ICOs.

Indeed, I'm going by global industrial average. While it's much lower than the consumer cost of electricity you're correct that it can be cheaper regionally.
However, those regions only make up a portion of the global hashrate, and thus on average its no longer profitable. This, btw, doesn't include all the other costs of mining - just electricity.
Agreed that once the next difficulty adjustment kicks in we should see improvement, but I'm positing we'll see some decent slowdowns in block solving times until then at least.

Now the question is: did they move them into a paper wallet and burn the private key, or is there someone in the FBI who has access to it?
If the former, that's done and done.
If it's the latter - wow,  imagine the series of checks, controls, and security placements they (should) have to keep a rogue agent from becoming insanely wealthy.

@_date: 2013-12-11 13:48:58
The biggest weakness I've seen in nearly every video explaining how Bitcoin works is attempting to explain the concept of "mining" to the layman.
I'm surprised more people don't frame it in the form of "there's some very complicated mathematics involved, but really it's like a lottery that everyone is racing to win every 15 minutes or so. The winning number is also the one that can prove the latest batch of transactions are valid, so everyone in the Bitcoin network can check and agree on the result, with the first person to find it getting a payout for their hard work."
A really simplified model, yes, but an accessible one.

I wonder if the next logical step for Tor is to give nodes the ability to rate traffic and give throughput upgrades to those willing to tip with Bitcoin.
Imagine being able to use Tor at high speeds based purely on how much Bitcoin dust you wanted to spend.
(Admittedly, I'm sure completely breaking net-neutrality for the Tor network isn't exactly high up there on the 'Things we want Tor to achieve' list)

I have three answers for you:
If you're going to buy and use it for transactions right now, then it's always the right time.
If you're going to buy and hold it as a long term (years+) investment, then it's always the right time.
If you're going to buy now, and be worried about the daily volatility or attempt to day trade, then three or four days ago was the right time when it crashed down to the upper $500's.
As far as getting some: I've never had problems with MTGox, Coinbase, or Localbitcoins.com

Price Stability:
Your comparisons to the USD are one of the issues with the current way of thinking: you're valuing Bitcoin against other currencies, which, while only natural at this stage in its growth, isn't necessarily the end-state.
It may very well be that an entire class of services will evolve that make sense only when classified as units of Bitcoin, and thus don't easily match up to world currencies. This is especially plausible given the (currently underused and still roughly defined) scripting power inherent in Bitcoin processing.
Imagine how we currently value endless iterations of the SHA256 algorithm: work is being performed in a way that, a few years ago, would have made no economic sense. Extend that line of imagination and there may be entire fields of economic utilities Bitcoin can offer that doesn't make sense as just cold, hard cash.
Regardless, there is, most likely, a plateau (or set of predictable plateaus as the tech improves) based on the amount of electricity its possible to consume to generate Bitcoin vs the sum total of available electricity. Right now we're above $15mm a day in electricity costs. That alone puts a reasonable limit on how many devices will ultimately be hashing, and thus makes the hashing difficulty have a bound (or set of bounds). This will ultimately become a price determining factor as well (as a lower bound), as you can see even now if you look at the cost of mining rigs, cloud hashing services, and next-gen hashing (like the Monarch from BFL) and their associated costs vs lifetime profitability.
It's amazing how nicely the invisible hand has already tightened on mining costs and profits.
Market-Share Fragmentation:
There are a couple of possibilities here for actions a whale may perform:
* 1) Hold the coins eternally (lost coins from the early days)
* 2) Sell the coins in mass
* 3) Use the coins in the Bitcoin economy
For  there have been and continue to be those whales who do this, and yet the price of Bitcoin is still in the $1k USD range. This is rather remarkable.
On the other hand, the earliest adopters of Bitcoin were not necessarily in it to get rich quick. Instead, there are some who believe that the entire point is not to "cash out" the Bitcoin for a fiat currency, but to build an economy in which they have great weight.
It's in their benefit to hold and become  why sell now for USD, when they can fund a small country tomorrow? We already see services, hardware, and jobs being performed for Bitcoin. The earliest adopters have the strongest incentive to use Bitcoin, rather than sell it.
Just some idle thoughts.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:09:29
I may be mistaken, but I believe the SHA-256 algorithm that is used for Bitcoin hashing does not use (pseudo) random number generation.
Instead it seeds the initial values with the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 primes 2..19.
Thus, in relation to Bitcoin, we shouldn't be worried.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:01:37
Perhaps the Bitcoin Foundation should start soliciting feedback from the community to agree upon a standard, even if its not ultimately "official" given the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.
Keep in mind any new symbols (e.g. not the Baht ฿) would have to go through adoption by technology vendors to display as a new Unicode symbol.
I would personally support a fundraiser held by the Bitcoin Foundation that collected votes by Bitcoin spent on the various symbol concepts.
The winning BTC amount helps determine the symbol and the BF gets more operating capital.

PS: Or, we could always have Thailand just replace its entire currency with Bitcoin and take over the Baht!

Congratulations! You are now the owner of a Strategy your business could use not only to cut costs with your current clientele, but also attract the business of other international clients.
What benefit does Bitcoin give your company compared to all the other ways of handling your invoices? This sounds like the big question your boss wants you to answer.
Then nitty gritty: by what margin is it provably better for existing uses? What facts and figures can you show? What are the real numbers?
Then be the futurist: Where is the Bitcoin economy going? How is growth in China affecting the market, and can that be extrapolated for other countries not yet hitting the big time in the news?
Avoid long winded technical explanations: Bitcoin is an internet digital currency that is fast, secure, and has near-zero or zero transactional fees.

All points fully agreed on! Excellent breakdowns to my more pithy remarks.

We could probably already do this with Bitcoin with advances in the scripting system!
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:33:22
After looking into it, this is a very valid point, and was actually exploited when a few hardware wallet vendors had a problem where the PRNG was returning the same "random number" each time, causing input scripts to be reversible back to the private key.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:53:56
It's always possible that someone will innovate a use for transaction puzzles in the scripting system that could perform more useful work in the network.
