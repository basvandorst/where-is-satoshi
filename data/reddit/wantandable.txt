Sometimes people arent in positions because of choices theyve made. Sometimes theyre born or forced into situations. And even if they have all the knowledge of everything they could do to avoid those situations or fix them it doesnt mean theyre applicable for you or that its not too late to apply them.
Example. My wife is 25 years old and wasnt taught the importance of education at a young age and didnt have any money. Shes worked low skill jobs since she was 13 to help her family pay rent. Now she has developed an auto immune disease that costs $2000/month in medication that limits her ability to perform jobs with physical labor on which she had been relying. She was also born in one of the highest cost of living cities in the country. She would never be able to escape that on her own.
Gambling what little savings we can manage with Bitcoin is a small chance at a true escape from an impossible situation.
Tl;dr: Just read the first half. Thats the point. The rest is whiny supporting evidence

I just saw! Ive made more money in the last 2 weeks (my first 2 weeks) with Bitcoin than I have on all my savings ever before.

I received a reward from Coinbase as well near the beginning. I believe they do it with everyone merely as an incentive. Nothing to be concerned about.

Whats great about predictions with no timeline and no evidence, is you can say anything you want and then say "well its GOING to happen, soon." And if it ever happens then you were right! Be it next week or in 10 years!

And that transfer to your wallet completely detaches you from Coinbase...so it has to be real then?
Everyone could transfer out of Coinbase simultaneously  and no one would get shafted?:p

Coinbase is simply GDAX with a simpler UI in exchange for higher fees and the prices are slightly delayed from GDAX.

Ha its pretty good :p Just bought a Ledger Nano S getting delivered on the 20th. Due to Coinbase limits I wasnt able to put too much in but I have already made about $300 USD, 90% On Bitcoin and a bit on Litecoin.

Ive accumulated .03 or so in the last week.
I intend to HODL till 2020 at least (since halvings and the lightning network release seem to be good times to stay for) and am trying to resist the urge to put too much in...
Im still using Coinbase because it forces me to limit myself.

Theres this little upstart company called Amazon. Theyre very reliable, but you didnt hear it from me. Once everyone finds out theyre gonna blow up!

I imagine, Coinbase is unlikely to fail unless theres a massive change with the status of Bitcoin  and crypto in general, as well.

Hi, really like the idea behind the service. I didnt start with a gift but i know people who have.
And if it's anything like when I first discovered Bitcoin it starts them down a rabbit hole of obsession about it! So my one question..
Do you rely on the receiver to have their interest sparked and do the research themselves?
I havent used the service, but a short 60 second video with 4 or 5 sentences pointing out why it's a game changer and is different than the past might be a good idea.
Whenever I talk to people who dont use Crypto. Usually their primary belief is it's just like  normal money but on the computer. And that its basically the same as their banking apps in their mind. And if you immediately get rid of that misconception it goes a long way to them going "oh okay so this is a big new thing."
Andreas Antonopoulos' videos were huge for my understanding. Now obviously they are all quite long but he has a few introductory videos where a select few sentences are able to explain 1)why it's so important and 2) make complicated ideas simple
Definitely a good place to look for inspiration in easy  ways for people to learn
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:01:34
I heard negative things about Coinbase (mostly the high fees) so I transfered my small amount of bitcoin to GDAX.
Anyways...i became uncomfortable because i found it to be too much for me (lots of information i didnt fully understand)
So I went to move my bitcoin back to Coinbase and it said i had insufficient funds. So I then saw all these odd transactions immediately after my deposit I found confusing.
What are the "match" and "fee" items listed after my initial deposit?
All i did was transfer my money from Coinbase to GDAX and the  didnt perform any other actions.

I love this video. Andreas' comparison of Bitcoin to motorized vehicles and the internet is on point.
I think with the week weve had a lot of people are losing money and freaking out.
They think the timeline for money is 6 months...a year...2 years, 3 years, etc.
And while that may be true, maybe the green candles are after bakkt, maybe they're after the next halving, who knows.
We need to remember our fundamental belief in the revolutionary aspect of bitcoin, and that green candles now dont really matter. Where are we 20 years from now? That's what matters. In 20 years these bad days will be glossed over and no one will remember the "crash" down to 5k.

Shakepay. You e-transfer their email address. They accept and your fund are available. Then exchange your funds for BTC or ETH and withdraw to a wallet.
The whole process takes about 2 minutes everytime.
Account creation is less than 10 minutes.
I know it's on google play store in Canada, not sure about US..

Same here buddy. Only have about 20 bucks every 2 weeks to throw in.
But I do faucets for loads of different cryptos while I watch Netflix and then swap them to bitcoi  on exchanges.
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:22:41
It's pretty simple really. I just did it a few months ago.
You purchase a wallet. Recommended brands are Trezor or Ledger (the one I chose)
Then you set it up, your new wallet will have an address and you merely go into Coinbase and choose to send your  crypto to your new address.
If you want lower fees I recommend transferring Coinbase to GDAX then GDAX to wallet.
GDAX is Coinbases exchange, and they have lower fees than Coinbase itself. And because they're the same company, the transfer is instant from CB to GDAX. So you've got nothin to lose and you get lower fees going to your outside wallet.

Delay after delay. Still supposed to hit before Trudeaus out of office. Early 2019 hopefully. Delays are explained as "giving the provinces time to get their regional systems in place"
No matter what it will come through though. The nation won't let it go now that it's come this close.
Already mostly legal anyways. My wife just bought weed for the first time in 3 years today and we got it at a store. All it took was a piece of government ID and being over 19.

Haha nbd. I consume a lot of American media as do many Canadians (we don't have enough of our own) so i am VERY aware of Jeff Sessions and the hilarity of the states rights vs. Federal law situation you've got going on when it comes to your cannabis laws.
Provinces are very similar to states. Right now we have a very large disagreement between the province of Alberta and British Columbia. Alberta relies heavily on oil exports for its economy and wants to run a new pipeline through BC to reach the coastline. BC is very hipster/environmental and is opposed.
So Alberta has jacked up BCs gas prices to get us to give in. Causing Vancouver (my homeL to have the highest gas cost in all of North America at the moment.
Random I know, but just so you see our provinces are very similar to states. They have their own regional ideals and desires.
Hopefully we get our weed soon so we can forget about how much gas costs ;)

I can't speak for right now but when I bought mine the Ledger Nano S ran me $100 CAD and it is perfectly functional and you don't need anything more expensive if you're new.
Up to you on wether or not that's too much $.
IMO once you have around $1000 in crypto it's probably worth it.
Remember to look at what wallets support what currencies though.
Some of the newer ones may only be supported by a few wallets, and very new ones might not have ANY compatible hardware wallets.
