Because "everyone" doesn't want to, I dunno why you would believe that EVERYONE wants that. That is simply stupid. Do you really think any other 1st world country is hurting for immigration? 
People like the USA because they can exploit its dumb population, and make lots of money. OR they want to advance their career in someway, but in reality all the science and engineering stuff is a small minority of people.*** The vast majority are ignorant, racist, anti-science, anti-reality, etc.*** This makes your country a shithole.

1) Obviously on purpose
2) I am not the leader of a country. Context and all

I am from Canada, I apologize for being pretty harsh... I mean there are millions of people in the USA who do not fit into the "stupid American" stereotype. 
I have had lots of hope for the future in the past, not so much anymore. It also scares me that things haven't gotten better for you guys over my entire adult life.
 I have really only seen US politicians doing terrible stuff with loads of support from the US population (war in Iraq for example). So many more are completely brainwashed by mega churches, Jesus camps, etc that its extremely hard for me to see a positive future between our nations. You have more Evangelicals than we have in terms of POPULATION! It's pretty hard not to look south in disgust, its honestly gotten worst over the past 15 years as well.
Is it legally possible to "split" the country into two new countries? If all the Blue States just formed a new country we could solve many problems!!
Otherwise my suggestion, immigrate to Canada/EU or countries that protect their people, the workers. Not corporations/religions and their profits.

You are just the worst one in the "West" and you tend to fuck everyone in the world for your own benefits.
Fuck you guys

Which is why some people think bug bounties are not the right approach..

But once gox moved those coins to the USA all bets are off.

Ask megashare users of they got their data back from the American authorities
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:26:42
Can you imagine if they were seized and "accidentally" deleted?
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:01:31
Imagine if you were mining for the past 2 years and horded all the coins until the price hits 1000. I wonder what the ROI would be on the mining costs.

Well hopefully the guy mirrored the disks and didn't stripe them

Firewall is better.. deny all by default, only allow what you trust though the FW. The pool you connect to would be the only IPs allowed to communicate with your machine..
The solution posted could be circumvented by updated the firmware and changing the DNS entry. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:32:32
Ideally you would have a firewall infront of the router. But that is probably overkill for most home setups.. it's great if you have some old firewalls sitting around at work though...
I don't trust tplinks ability to secure it's router.. so I threw a juniper in front of it.!

And certain countries currencies are easier to launder than others. So the entire statement in the post is basically BS.

Plausible deniability?

I always mix up Iceland and Newfoundland populations.. very similar in size

Like 200k people small

The software needs to be designed to scale that way, and its not easy to design software to scale perfectly.

Oracle has proven that the they don't have a strong handle on how to build a secure language. There is a long history of exploits allowing code to be executed through the JVM without user interaction. 
If the JRE was not up to date (or in some cases it is up to date) there are exploits that people can use to install a keylogger or any application really. I recommend my clients do not install java and opt for a form of application virtualization for applications that require it.

If they are in the position where they can read your wallet encrypted or not, then you have already lost.

Banks tend to use very old mainframe type systems, as400, etc for their book of records and transactions. They are very old, and havent changed much. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:42:05
I cannot find a delete account function.. I havent made any transactions or hold any BTC in their wallet so Im okay to delete.
Any ideas?
