Now you can buy bitcoins at 28000 locations across the UK with zipzap.

I think it's the premining and pump and dump tactics (e.g. "Quarkcoin") that most people object to. Personally I do believe there is a place for a few competing cryptos but ultimately they will all live in the shadow of BTC due to the enormous advantage provided by the network effect.

keep trying periodically on coinbase, I don't think the 6am thing is accurate. I just got through about an hour (and $3) ago. Also, try smaller orders, it didn't let me order 10 but 3 seconds later my order of 5.5 went through.

Yes the early adapters make out like bandits, but I don't really see it as much of a problem. There will always be entrenched powers but at least with Bitcoin those powers are naturally anti-establishment. It is is the currency of the resistance. 
I still think it is very early at this stage anyway; this could easily play out for decades.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:27:35
We are still in the frontier days of crpyto-currencies. If successful, eventually buying and using bitcoins will be seamless. It will just take time for the necessary infrastructure to build up but it will happen if it's meant to happen. 
Of course the fact that bitcoins are currently relatively hard to obtain and store means that the potential rewards are a lot more than for someone who comes along later on when it's easy.

Credit card and paypal transactions can be reversed so people don't use them for selling bitcoin.
I haven't used it but maybe try localbitcoins.com and put in your country, and choose a highly rated seller (with lots of transactions/good reviews). Then you (I think) use moneygram to purchase them with cash.

Won't hurt but who knows if BTC will even exist in 16 years. If it does it will probably be very valuable. I certainly hope higher education will be different by then, and that the overpriced diploma mills are gone.

Even if they used malware to surreptitiously mine bitcoins on other people's computers, I don't see how that makes them  "counterfeiters" (as appears in the headline of the original article) or somehow makes the bitcoins mined "fake" (in the second one).

Awesome, I plan on doing the same within a couple of weeks. That you can now buy airline tickets with BTC just gives it that much more utility.
I noticed they also offer car rentals and hotels. I wonder if there are any plans to expand BTC acceptance to those areas as well? It's probably more complicated though because both those things almost always require a credit card on file. Maybe someone clever will come up with a service that lets people put down BTC as a deposit.

Last month Overstock.com was considering adding BTC as a payment method but decided against it at this time, but this was before that fairly positive Senate hearing.
I think we should keep up the pressure. Patrick Byrne is more of a libertarian than Bezos and if one of Amazon's top competitors starting accepting it that would put enormous pressure on them.

They can use have their partners in crime (the big banks) refuse to work with the exchanges, or impose burdensome regulations. This has already happened to some extent, see BitInstant or all the problems Mt. Gox has had.
Since there's no central point failure their options are limited as far as I can tell. It's kind of like how the entertainment industry has no hope of ever shutting down Bittorent. They could make it illegal but that doesn't mean the price will necessary go down (just look at recreational drugs). And now that people like Sir Richard Branson are vocal proponents it has really shifted the debate away from them taking any drastic actions. So they hold their Senate hearings and pretend not to really care, when it's not that they wouldn't love to destroy it, but they know they can't.

But how is Vialle shouldering the financial risk posed by the volatile nature of Bitcoin? After all, the price is currently three times what it was a month ago on the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox (as recorded by BitcoinX), and could potentially drop as fast at it has risen. How can Vialle afford to take the chance that $40,000 worth of Bitcoin could become $30,000 overnight? “That's simple,” he says, "I don't.”
Vialle processes the Bitcoin payments through Bitpay, a Bitcoin payment processor based out of Atlanta, GA. Bitpay clears and settles the funds (in this case, into US dollars) directly to his bank account within 24 hours with no risk to the dealership, even if the Bitcoin price rises or falls within that time frame. Of course the later is less of an occurrence these days, with the price of a single Bitcoin now over $1000.
“The fact that I can use Bitpay to receive a settlement in dollars makes it possible for me to accept Bitcoin in the first place”, says Vialle. “If more dealers were aware of this, I'm sure they'd be accepting Bitcoin as well.”

I agree that the two can easily co-exist peacefully, but I am not surprised at the backlash and it will probably go on for some time.
Then again maybe they should be concerned. Crpyto-currencies are something so completely out of their purview.  If people can get used to such a radically different paradigm maybe their whole grip is threatened.
Besides, as you mentioned, they will likely lose business doing wire transfers. Cost to transfer $4 million between two banks, about $100,000. Cost of $4 million in BTC, about 25 cents.

Do you have a coinbase account? I think there's a way to send the BTC to his email address and then they let him know to set up his own acccount. Or maybe just set up and fund a blockchain.info wallet for him. Coinbase is more user-friendly for newcomers though.

I'm kind of torn on it but I think it's probably ultimately a good thing, and not just because of perception that it's "cheaper". 
Mostly I'm not confident the majority of people understand decimals or fractions well enough to tell the difference between .1 and .01 and this can help with that.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:18:27
It's because Mt. Gox has major liquidity problems. There's no real arbitrage opportunity.
