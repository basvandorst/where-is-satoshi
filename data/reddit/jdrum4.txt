Whatever evidence you provide on your tax return. The problem comes in when you under (or over) report your earnings. If they suspect youre under reporting they might audit, looking at all your assets. True they might not know how to check to see if youre holding a bunch of BTC in a wallet but its only a matter of time before they figure that out. Plus lets say you decide to liquidate BTC later that you didn't report?  How are you going to justify that income?

do you think it has to be a wallet feature or an independent stand alone site where you could automatically figure out what you're making?

Listen I'm as much a hater of the tax arm of the government as anyone else. That said it is better to pay what you owe than to end up under that microscope. I understand there are a a lot of baddie renegades mining bitcoin but paying taxes is the best way to keep them off your ass and out of your business,

Good luck running your btc under the IRS radar.  I was talking about capital gains taxes--income from your btc. You asked what a BTc audit would look like. You are already under the impression that you can get away with not reporting and I'm not here to tell you that you can't. I will be declaring my income and keeping the IRS out of my business, to that end I would use whatever tools available to figure out not only what i owe but how much can deduct.

good site, is there a way to track day to day expenses? I know there must be a way to deduct costs of equipment and electricity.

I wish you well Spotted but I think your thinking is skewed. Maybe you never intend on converting your BTC to cash but what about the things you buy with it?  Spend it anywhere and you now have physical representation of wealth that can be traced back to the source. Even .00001  mixed BTC spent proves you didn't pay taxes on it. You think youre the first guy that thought of that? I'm sure everyone that's defrauded the govt via non-declaration thought they were saavy too and that they'd never get caught.

I would have to agree here. Bitcoin is a commodity--it's property according to the rules. They would have a hard time convincing a judge/jury much less explaining it to one.
