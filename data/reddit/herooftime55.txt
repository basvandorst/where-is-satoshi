I sold at the start and bought back in near the bottom.  Have more bitcoin than I started with.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:17:51
You don't really need to know the bottom as much as you need to know the local top.  You just need to know when to sell.  And as long as you buy somewhere less than what you sold, you're in business.  You don't need to know the exact bottom, especially if it is far down enough - and further, the way Bitcoin crashes, there will be a LONG period of time where it sits at the bottom before it rises to new heights, so it is REALLY hard to miss where the bottom is.  It ain't hitting 5k again for years, y'all seem to think this is a temporary dip, lol.  It's gonna take years to rise again.

Again with the straw man that I am comparing this to a casino.  I am not.  I have not.  YOU are constructing that straw man against me.  I have not made such a comparison.  A straw man is when you accuse me of an argument I have not made, in order to make it easier to take down the fake argument, rather than my actual argument.  It's not "just because you disagree with me," it's because you're constructing an actual straw man.
I do not dispute that you can look at various factors and improve your odds, even significantly.  And you speak of an AI that is really, really good at determining the odds.  But at the end of the day, it is still just odds - probability.  No matter how much you boil down as much information as possible, there will always be randomness.  Even if you have perfect information about the molecular arrangement inside the President's skull, there is still randomness and unpredictability.  There is still chance.  It is still a gamble, even if you make it a safe gamble.
We have much bigger concerns than the price of Bitcoin when AI gets that powerful.

If you invest 100 dollars and it hits 1m/btc, then you made 20k.  Which is nice, but not untold riches.  You have to risk a lot more to make a crapton of money.  And you have to already have serious wealth for it to make sense to risk 50k on bitcoin.

What happens when the most popular defense provider decides that they're going to use all that power to take over?
What is to stop these two Bitcoin Millionaires running this to just use their wealth to buy mercs and rule over the people foolish enough to come?  The goodness of their hearts, I guess?
Power voids get filled fast by those willing to fill them.  You have some nebulous hypothesis of "The people will have power!" without bothering to explain the technicalities of how that is supposed to work.
You need a minimum government, even if it's only job is to sit there filling a power void so that nobody else can come fill it.  That, of course, comes with its own problems (how do you keep it from expanding itself?), but voids don't work, and this proposal is for a void.

Because it's going to go up a little bit, and then continue to free fall.  Sell now, then buy back in when it bottoms out in a month or so.  THEN you hodl until it spikes to 20k in 3 years.

This is the boat I'm in, I got about $150.  Shame on me for not buying years back when it was 5 bux a coin, and I knew it was gonna be a big thing.  But maybe a blessing in disguise, since the most trustworthy place to buy BTC back then was MtGox... lol.
I'm just being an armchair finance guy running my mouth atm.  Gonna watch for my time to make my next buy, but it ain't right now.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:31:08
Right, I'm not saying they wouldn't.  I am not saying BTC loses long term.  Of course they get back in after they crash it down.  Corner the market and manipulate it to death.  I am saying, here and now, it's going to go way down, before it goes up to new heights.  It has to crash before it hits $20k in 2-3 years.
If you hold for eternity, your worth will, ultimately and eventually, go up.  But you can gain even more by knowing when to move in and out.  Right now is a good time to move out, before you move back in later.  If you sell 1 BTC for the price as of writing of $3.8k, and lets say it only drops to $1.9k at the end of this, now you can take that fiat and buy 2 BTC with it.  So when it spikes to $20k in 3 years, you now have $40k instead of $20k.  
You have to be really panicky to worry about this and to try and discredit people pointing this out, by pretending they think BTC loses long term (which I absolutely do not).  BTC is the future of money, but -right now- it is unstable, so if you are wise, you will realize where it is right now, instead of pretending it's where we all want it to eventually end up (and where it will eventually end up), and take advantage of the instability to multiply your wealth and walk away with more BTC than you started with.

You can hold it all the way down to 1.5k, but you're throwing away perfectly good wealth.  The measure is not how many dollars you have or how many bitcoins you have, but how much wealth you have.  Holding during a major crash is just bleeding wealth, it's stupid.  Sell and get back on the bus when it's at the bottom - you wind up with more bitcoins than you started with.  Do you not want more bitcoins?

It crashed from $50 to $10, it crashed from $1000 to $200.  Rough figures.  $1000 here as the low is also a rough figure.  But I mean, use your judgement, if you see it starting to go back up and you think it's not a trap, you can go for it.  Maybe it won't go that low, but it seems to fit in with the previous patterns, a crash to ~20% of the peak, and $5k is the peak here.
If it climbs back to $4.5k, then there is no big crash (yet).  If it drops to $3.5k, then major crash is confirmed, in my mind.
That's as far as patterns are concerned, anyway.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:08:02
(hold is stupid though, sell in this bull trap, wait for it to hit 2.5k before considering buying, I think it could go as low as 1.5k)

You think China is stupid or ignorant, and hasn't been manipulating the market for their own gains.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:35:52
Case in point: Today, China bans ICOs.  That's not something a formula can predict.  You're off your rocker.  Bitcoin is wonderful, but the price is an always will be subject to the ultimate unpredictability of human beings making human decisions.  It does not have value unless humans give it value.  People can look at trends and make predictions, but those predictions can be wrong and can change in an instant on some big news.
I understand how Casinsos work.  I was just making an observation that trading bitcoin isn't often as "free" as people like to claim.  Yes, it is possible to come out ahead on Bitcoin because there isn't a central organization trying to screw you at the end of the day, but this has always been a straw man you initially constructed against me.
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:50:04
If I had real assets I'd be selling them off right now, but as it stands, I just put about a hundred into BTC/ETH/LTC through Coinbase (spent a fuckton on fees for small transactions lol) and I probably will sit on them, because any decision is gambling (also stupid fees because I am acting like a complete novice and using Coinbase for this shit, lol).  Expecting a crash at some point, if and when it does, I'm buying in.  Regretting not keeping up with Bitcoin, I remember when it was $5 and I was sitting at a table with my folks telling them about this hot new thing called Bitcoin and they should consider buying some.

Pure anarchy does not work.  Someone will always be ready to fill the power void.  It will rapidly evolve into some form of government.
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:37:41
Once power is secured, people taking their money elsewhere no longer is a viable solution.  See also: Every government on the face of the earth.
I suppose my point is that there might not be a solution.  I'm not saying that a minimal government isn't going to expand (they do, I explicitly mention this).  There are always going to be people that give themselves power.  Anarchy doesn't help, honestly it just makes the path easier for anyone not in the establishment already, by doing away with any such establishment.
I hope you won't mistake me for being someone who is a fan of governments.  Seems to be a necessary evil though, in preferably extreme moderation.
The system you advocate also seems to just be a form of Tyranny of the Majority.  Lets do a little thought experiment.  Gay people exist and want to live their lives in peace without violating anyone's Liberty.  Let's say ~75% of the people, being that culturally they have strong religious beliefs in this particular scenario, don't like that, in fact they don't like gay people at all.  They all, quite happily, put sizable amounts of their money towards a mercenary force whose job is to target, terrorize, and kill gay people.  How does your utopia deal with that?  People aren't voluntarily moving their money elsewhere because that's what they signed up for.
It's great that you think these problems magically go away just because people want to move their money somewhere else - but this makes a lot of big assumptions, like that people actually want to move their money, that people can't be relentlessly cruel to each other, that people are not inherently flawed and imperfect actors.
It is, of course, a very tough problem, the difference is that I don't pretend to have the solution.

There is no such thing as "fiat wealth."  There is just "wealth," everything holds value relative to everything else.  In this current moment in time, fiat is very stable compared to Bitcoin, and is therefore used as a metric for wealth, but it is not itself wealth.  Dollar has lost a lot of value over the many years, of course.  But compared to Bitcoin, it's stable as a rock.

I can afford to buy maybe $25 worth every 2 weeks.  I am not very well off but want to get into coins - should have done it a long time ago.  I have ~$150 in BTC/ETH/LTC right now, looking to move it off Coinbase, don't know if I can afford a Trezor.  Man, I wish I could afford to dump in $2k.
I do think it is going to go to 20k and beyond, but I don't think that's going to be for a long while.  I think this bubble is going to pop first, it's going to fall to probably around 1k, and the next few years are going to see it shoot to new heights.

As far as what news story is going to move it, my bets are on North Korea.  I think that's what capped it at $5k, and the hydrogen bomb is going to push it down.
Consider:  
-Much of the rise is thanks to Asian countries - in particular here, China, Japan, and South Korea.
-Bitcoin relies on Internet and computer infrastructure to work
-Little Kimmy just unveiled a weapon that, in all likelihood, he wouldn't use to target cities, but rather as an EMP to take out an entire country's electric and information infrastructure
Even if you put your Trezor in a Faraday cage, without the infrastructure, you can't transact, and the value of your coin will tank dramatically.  Hard assets like gold are much more useful in that (hopefully hypothetical) scenario.  If it actually happens, it could plummet well below even $1k.  But I think the fear will bring it down to around $1k-ish.  It's a unique threat that Bitcoin faces that other assets don't.  Even fiat fares better than Bitcoin in that scenario (of an EMP actually being used).  It's the opposite of what a prepper would want to hold, and the NK situation is creating more preppers.
I think the Asians are starting to realize that and are backing down.  That, I think, will be the driving force in this crash.  Not anything JP Morgan says, that is irrelevant here.  If and when the NK issue resolves, it will spike back up.  Hell, years from now, it will spike again regardless.  But for now that's what is driving it down.  Not anything these dinosaurs say.

Because you wind up with more bitcoin in the end than if you just hold straight through, buddy.  Make your wealth do work instead of just sitting on it.
If I buy 1 BTC at 1k and it goes up to 5, then I still have 1 BTC.  If it crashes down and 3 years later it's 20k, now I have 1 BTC forth 20k USD.
Now, if I sold that coin at 5k, and when it crashed to 2.5k, I bought back in with my whole 5k I made on that sale, I now have not one, but 2 bitcoins.  When it goes back up to 20k, now I have 2 BTC worth 40k USD.
So many people don't understand this.

A lack of ability to predict with any real accuracy is equivalent to chance, and makes any move made equivalent to "gambling."  Further, there are events external to the Bitcoin network that influence the price, and that is totally and absolutely up to chance.  Not all gambling involves a house that takes a cut, either.  If a group of friends gather to play poker, it's still gambling.  Which doesn't apply here anyway because Bitcoin brokers do take a cut, as does the network itself...
Of course, not doing anything is also an action of its own.  I'm aware that Bitcoin is a thing, and therefore my actions or lack thereof are decisions I am making in the market.  Especially since I am participating and have the intent to participate (if only for my own amusement at this point so far).

I think I sold out around 3.6k actually.  Just playing with pocket change as a learning experience so I ultimately lost a grand total of 10 dollars so far trading bitcoin.  So all in all, I guess it's a small price to pay to learn these lessons, no?
Still, could have made maybe $100 in worth if I had followed my gut.
As of now, I only have a few scraps of bitcoin worth about $3 from an ancient wallet back from like, 2012 I think - I have the keys, but I might decide to never touch those just for kicks to see where it goes.  All my GDAX money is in USD for now.  This shit better not be Tethers...

Just because it happened in the past doesn't guarantee it to happen again in the future.  The only way to win (in that extreme) was to have been smart/lucky enough to have gotten in on the ground floor, when it was pennies or dollars, and then resisted the urge to sell out when it spiked to $50, and then resisted the urge to sell when it spiked again to $1000.  (Or, been smart enough to sell at the spike and buy in again after the crashes)
You aren't guaranteed to make a fortune in the future based on the past.  You probably won't get filthy rich.  You will probably play conservatively, and sell your coins off if and when they hit $10k, which is a nice "I've doubled my investment!" point, but hardly riches.
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:23:46
No need to hodl for years when we know the next moonshot isn't tomorrow.  Bitcoin has a pretty regular pattern of insane spikes followed by slow decline over a few years before the next spike.  When it's been hovering between 1k and 2k for a year or so, that's when you start buying it up.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:50:11
I think it's gonna drop to 2k and possibly 1.5k.  Could go even lower, but if it goes much lower than that it will really demotivate people.  About 1.5k is a healthy correction, anything less breeds long term uncertainty.
It's still over 3k.  So if it goes down to 1.5, why not double your coins?

You can opt out up until the government sends men with guns to tell you otherwise.  Having Bitcoin doesn't stop them from coming to your door and fucking you up.

This is a straw man.  I never once said this.  I was not "redefining" my use of the word "gambling," and, in fact, it was YOU who accused me of meaning one particular thing that I didn't mean.
All investments, including and especially crypto currency investments, are gambling, because there is chance, randomness, and a lack of absolute predictability.  Crypto, in particular, is highly volatile, and makes it more of a gamble than other forms of investment.  Gambling doesn't mean you can't win, or that you can't improve your odds by some means.
You seem to have taken particular offense to this notion.

And yes, if you just hold, even if it crashes catastrophically, in a few years it will hit a new high many times higher than a mere $5k, and you will win.  But my point is that you can win harder, and the hold maymays are incredibly simplistic.  Your money isn't doing anything if you just sit on it.  Moving it around in the correct way makes it do work for you and earns you more worth.
Bitcoin is a winner long term, but it's going to lose (again) before it wins (again).  Highly unstable, but that instability is an opportunity.

ycir is exactly right.  All these people hopeful that the next tiny blip is the next moonshot are kidding themselves.  Moonshot is over (for now).  Slow decline to somewhere between $1k -$2k, then a long bottom.  Next moonshot won't be for years (but will probably hit $20k or higher).  But for now, you can buy 1 bitcoin at $3.6k or you can buy 3 bitcoins later at $1.2k.  If you want to buy them up at this high price, be my guest, lol.
Y'all still have hysteria from the moonshot to 5k.  But that was the summit.  It's over.  Long wait to the next one.  Not FUD, just a reality check.  Also it has to survive November.  November probably the only real existential threat to Bitcoin, people are going to get sick of regular forking in a hurry and jump ship to other cryptos.  S2X isn't the threat, it's just the fact that it looks ready to fork again that will do it.  We will see on that one.  Really dumb to buy before that passes though, unless it drops reeeeally far before hand.

Oddly enough, I wouldn't have even been awake at that hour if I hadn't been trying to catch the Cassini broadcast, so lol.

I didn't have a job or money back then, I was going through a very deep period of depression and was basically completely disabled.
Besides, I probably would have wound up with my "assets" stuck in MtGox anyway, back in that day and age, lol.  Blessing in disguise, perhaps.

And here we go!

I would have bought on MtGox and lost everything.
As to why not, it was a difficult period in my life with mental health issues and I did not have a job or money with which to purchase Bitcoin.  Otherwise I would have (and probably lost it all on MtGox)
Enjoy your hold maymays.  You'll eventually win long term, enjoy waiting 2-3 years for your losses to come back.  Better profits await those willing to act instead of sitting on their wealth.

I used to keep acceptable ads on, but you can get drive by downloads even from trusted, mainstream sites.  Hackers infest the ad network, act legitimately for a little while to gain trusted status, then start dropping malware.  Always block all ads.  Until the ad networks figure out how to stop the distribution of malware through ads, I won't participate in that economy.
