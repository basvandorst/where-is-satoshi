Just because our current government uses violence, doesn't mean that all forms of community leadership (i.e., government) would be violent!
Think about our bitcoin community.  Gavin A, Greg M, Mike H, etc provide leadership because a lot of us agree that they are doing good things!  What is wrong with this?  They don't hold a gun to your head if you download the DOGE client, do they?  
I completely agree that real community leaders don't need to use violence and those that rely on violence are not really legitimate.  Doesn't mean that community leadership is bad or that all those in leadership roles would be violent.  
Bitcoin will force governments (i.e., community leadership) to change in ways that are good for our communities, I believe.

OK, I think I've answered my own question: you reload the same document and your site recognizes that I've already time stamped it.  
But how does it know?  Is it actually digging though the blockchain, or is it using your server?  
Is the format for storing the hash open-source?  I.e., if I store the hash of my document manually in the blockchain, would your service still recognize that it had been time-stamped?  It seems that it would be beneficial to the community to come up with interoperable formats here.

How is this terrible news?  It seems completely reasonable and like what most were expecting.  Did you think bitcoin would allow you to legally escape income and capital gains taxes or avoid reporting requirements?

Different than what I expected from the Video Contest entries (a bit more violent lol), but I really liked it!  Well done guys!!
My only suggestion would be to somehow make even more clear the "Apple bans bitcoin" link.
EDIT: I also liked how you added the NSA data sharing comment.
@_date: 2014-04-14 06:29:16
Hmm.  I think I see your point now.  
So, the word "government" has become so tainted now that the definition only includes forms of community leadership that use force to control people.  
That would explain the downvotes LOL!
The only problem I see with this is then if you say you are "anti government" and what you really mean is that you are "anti violence and forced control" but a lot of people think you are "against all forms of community organization."
Does this make sense?

lol, I bought at the peak of the April 2013 run-up.  I had just learned about this amazing technology and decided I had to participate.  I invested what I thought I could risk (about $1000), bought at $230, and then watched it collapse into the $50s!
But I kept learning about bitcoin and become more and more impressed.  I decided that I could "risk" a lot more than $1000, since the chance I gave to a complete collapse had been reduced in my mind.   I continued to buy over the summer, scoring coins as low as $70. 
In hindsight, the fact that the April run-up burst and we had a long period of flat or declining prices turned out to be a very positive thing for me.  I  think the same thing is happening now.

Wouldn't you win?  Isn't the official rate for the peso *higher* than the market rate, so you'd get more USD per peso at the official rate?  I think you want to sell dollars at the market rate, and sell pesos at the official rate.

Pay with a Coinbase wallet and it auto-recognizes the receiving address as another Coinbase wallet and does the transaction off-chain and for 0 fee.  
Pretty slick: reduce network dust and make micro-payments more feasible.

What is BitPay's opinion here?  
My initial impression is that this pull request is irresponsible at this point in time.  
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:33:23
Everyone is missing my point.  Just because our current government uses guns and prisons and force to control people, doesn't mean that all governments would.  
I really believe we could have community leadership (i.e., governments) that are completely non-violent and legitimate!  I think people will naturally emerge as thought leaders in certain communities.  It happens in the bitcoin community, right?  If we start to think they are providing bad leadership, we'll just stop listening to them.  
Forget everything you know about government and those imaginary lines drawn on maps, and imagine what could be possible with bitcoin, cryptography and the internet.

I think the media response during this downturn has been more positive than prior downturns.  The MSM is beginning to see that bitcoin has merit.  
However, to me it seems there are a greater % of trolls on bitcointalk, in the comments of articles, and here on Reddit.  It seems there are a lot of people working really hard on a day to day basis to spread misinformation.  I can't figure out what drives these people.

Why would you buy a chimpanzee for a dollar?  Where are you going to keep it?  What are you going to feed it?  I think they can be vicious sometimes too.  
The chimpanzee market has high transaction costs and not a lot of liquidity.

But there's no question mark on the Bitcoin headline on the front page of the Metro.  Is the inverse of Betteridge's law a valid corollary? 
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:15:18
This was a very good article and put into clear words a lot of the vague ideas I've been bouncing around in my head lately.  I agree with all points.  
The fact that bitcoin is the most liquid, has the highest market cap, and has the most investors is absolutely key.  It creates a enormous barrier to the adoption of any alt coin.

I don't understand why people immediately assume that the lobbying efforts are intended to hurt bitcoin.  If I was MasterCard, I would be interested in integrating bitcoin to better protect customers against fraud, simplify authentication, reduce cost, and maybe win over some Visa customers.  
A credit card has its private key printed on the front!  That is seriously the solution they came up!!  There must be a way they can leverage the bitcoin network for their benefit.

The format is open and quite easy: the file hash is just the last 256 bits (64 hex digits) in the output script (see my blockchain.info test run).  However, without proofofexistance.com, you'd have to search through the blockchain to find your hash.  
I do agree that proofofexistence could present the "proof of existence" in a more clear manner on the webpage (and make the "verify" procedure a bit more obvious).  
A very useful service nonetheless!
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:44:04
This represents fair guidance regarding the tax treatment of bitcoin.  I think it's exactly what most were expecting.
When I say "fair," I mean it does not give special privileges to bitcoins over dollars/gold/etc., or vice versa.  (In other words, bitcoin does not legally permit you to avoid income and capital gains tax or reporting requirements--but we knew that already.)
Note that it is logically consistent to view this guidance as "fair" while simultaneously viewing our tax system itself as either "good as is" or "needing rework." 
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:12:38
The "bloat" on my test case was 241 bytes and proofofexistance.com paid an exorbitant $207,469.00 / Gbyte to store it.  We are storing a 32-byte hash, not a 1 Mbyte file!  
This is exactly the type of innovation we should be encouraging.  
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:04:15
If you can easily find hash collisions, would you mind working on a collision for this one for me.  I need some new shoes:
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:51:21
Note to readers: I've now independently verified that beta.proofofexistence.com correctly hashed my test file and stored the file-hash in the blockchain.  
My test file was:
Both proofofexistence.com and Mathematica independently produced a SHA256 file-hash equal to:
Proofofexistance.com created this transaction for me:
and if you scroll to the bottom of the blockchain.info page and make sure "show scripts &amp; coinbase" is selected, you'll see the output script contains the file hash (in italics):
OP_RETURN 444f4350524f4f46*4c05f29a6f3e279c88130e7425c63842110afa59db822a1d6bd65a21a2dcb156*
So I've proven to myself that:
1.  Proofofexistance hashed my test file properly
2.  Proofofexistance correctly wrote the file hash into the blockchain.  
In other words, the file time-stamping service works as advertised.

Should blockchain pruning ever be implemented, archival nodes will store the complete (unpruned) history.  Perhaps they will charge a larger fee to access the stored data.  
Since the cost per Gbyte to store data in the blockchain is very high, the free-market will naturally limit its use to high-value data storage.  
This all sounds positive to me.  
@_date: 2014-04-14 03:39:53
Completely agree!
Government is just another name for community leadership.  Natural leaders emerge in all communities because they help to establish consensus.  
Bitcoin is about disintermediation (cutting out unnecessary 3rd parties) and giving people more power for self-determination.  
@_date: 2014-04-20 22:41:45
Awesome idea, and something I would use regularly.  
Some questions:  I am doing a test run using your site right now.  My test file got hashed, I sent the 5mBTC payment, and the hash will now be timestamped in the blockchain.  This part I understand.  
But now I want to prove to someone that my document existed.  Is there some way my colleage can upload the document that I claim existed on April 20, 2014, and your website go dig through the blockchain and say "ding, ding: yes, a hash of this document was embedded in block X on April 20, 2014."  Maybe you could charge a smaller fee (or make this part free).

I certainly believe in our right to privacy, but I don't understand the need to remove 100% of the taint.  Using SharedCoin with, say, 4 relays, you've really made a mess of the link between the sending and receiving addresses.

Perhaps you could implement a look-up service that is free for files hashed and stored by proofofexistance.com, but charges to search for hashes stored using other services.  
I think the important thing is to work towards interoperable standards, and it sounds like you agree.  
Congratulations once again on getting this important service running.

Bitcoin is about people, money and time.
Litecoin is about asics, mining and wallets
Peercoin users need "help" with "stats"
Ripple's cloud shows that "people trust bitcoin"
The most important word for dogecoin is "wow"
Mastercoin is focussed on Maidsafe
And Nxt users obsess over bitcoin

Note that the ruling was made for a "reverse-BitPay" payment system: the system would accept legacy payment methods (Visa/MC/etc) and settle with the merchant in cryptocurrency. It's not clear to me whether this ruling can be extrapolated to Bitpay and similar payment processors, as it's a different model.

Bitcoin is the tool that it needed to *prevent* the shitstorm.  
Bitcoin will allow fiat to collapse without a corresponding collapse in global trade.  As long as global trade is somewhat functional, energy and supplies will continue to flow into the big cities and some semblance of order will be maintained.

An IOU written on a napkin *is* a contract.  A contract can even be a verbal promise.  The reason people make formal-looking contracts and have witnesses sign them is to make it more clear that the parties actually meant to enter into an agreement.

The number of bitcoins unnecessarily lost to hard-drive failures, misplaced paper wallets, insecure brain wallets, hacks, theft and malware shows that managing your private keys is still not trivial for the average bitcoiner, not to mention new adopters.  
Charging 2% to competently manage private keys seems like a bargain to me.

Colored coins are a platform that you can send USD IOUs and other asset on.  Colored coins are like Ripple but with no counterparty risk on BTC assets and without the ripple trolls.

"have it backed up"
Backed up by what, gold or some other commodity?  But what are these commodities backed up by?  Ans: Simply the fact that they are scarce and that it takes work to extract them from the universe.  Bitcoins are scarce and it takes work to extract them from the universe too.  
The other thing many people new to bitcoin miss is that if a currency is "backed" by anything other than itself, then there is necessarily counter-party risk and centralization.
