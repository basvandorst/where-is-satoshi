I just did not do advanced mode when using the ledger. The fees that I used were the default fees.  I will never NOT do advanced mode when I move BIT or ETH anymore.  Thanks for the response!

I checked out your second link and its just three graphs of the fees. Where could I go to change the fee of my unconfirmed transaction to a 175sat/b fee? Is that even possible?

ANY help would be greatly apperciated. I am getting very discouraged with my Ledger nano S.

I understand that I screwed up big time by using low fees. I will pay whatever the appropriate fee is. I did the bitcoin transaction accelerator two days ago but still nothing.  Any other ideas? Thank you all for the responses!

What should I have set the fee at from advanced mode on my ledger? Thanks!

Just checked if I could update the Ledger nano s software but I am already at the newest version. Thanks for the idea though, I will be waiting another few days I guess!

Still an unconfirmed transaction after a week now. Any other thoughts?

Thank you for sending it to your friend. I wouldnt even mind paying some $ to get in cancelled or finished.  Again, thank you!
