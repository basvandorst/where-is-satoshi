The bubble design and the production-line plain blue makes it look like it is something you buy from a 2030 $1 toy dispensing machine at the local take-away hover shop.

I don't think the ATO has ever said private citizens have to pay 10% GST on the full price of bitcoin when buying bitcoin.
I always interpreted the rule as 10% GST on the service fee only (but because I and others were not 100% sure in the past they had to charge GST just in case).
From what I can gather Coiny doesn't charge a fee when buying, so 10% of nothing is $0. Even if they did charge a fee they still might not have to charge GST because Coiny users are buying from each other (not from Coiny) which is different from Independent Reserve, and BTC Markets.

I'm waiting for a model that doesn't need to be connected to a device that produces more tracking spyware data than my own user data.
Some kind of network like GPS where I can have a read only device (no GSM tracking).

If you carry a mobile phone in Australia and many other countries you can't rule out thousands of people (non-profits, financial bodies, emergency services etc.) knowing when you have diarrhoea because they can pinpoint your location via cell tower triangulation 24/7.
Your meta data could be pulled by;
* anyone? in the RSPCA when a neighbour complains about your dog (this may have been recently stopped in Australia?), 
* anyone? that works for the taxation department because you used PayPal 30 times in one month and you walked down a particular street (which happens to be a drug hotspot), 
* volunteers? in fire or rescue services can do checks on where you have been the last 2 years (were you riding your bike, or near that suspicious bushfire?)
 
The Australian government, and other governments are **not** going to spend billions of dollars on cybercrime and disable automation, use warrants to block access, and restrict access from the people who run society.
 
 I sound like I am against tracking, but some of it is okay because I can still go to the toilet, or go outside without being monitored (I don't carry a mobile).
Can you go to the toilet or go outside and say thousands of people and computer servers don't have access to your meta data trail?

I use Windows 7 and Thunderbird.
I tried GPG4win and it crashed 4 times (it could still function most of the time). Enigmail turned every reply message in bright blue text, I lost my html toolbar (I couldn't make URL links when not using PGP), and I couldn't figure out which keys and signatures went where.
I was very confusing and buggy so I gave up on PGP for the second time (I tried it 6 months ago and gave up on it then too).
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:22:06
When I say crash I mean GPG4win had bugs and closed without me initiating the close (my PC OS was uneffected).
I did manage to send and receive PGP encrypted mail, so I know it works.
Maybe I will try again and see if I can setup 1 dedicated PGP email address in Thunderbird without Enigmail highjacking all the other non-PGP email Thunderbird account display/settings profiles (I have 17 email accounts).
I also tried claws-mail and got it to work after a couple of hours but when it came to installing the PGP plugins for claws-mail I gave up as the plugin downloads were tarballs (what the heck is a tarball?).

There are now about [20 exchanges to buy bitcoin for Australian dollars]( (and deposit into an AUD bank account). About 15 others have closed.  Total of over 35 exchanges have operated or are operating.

Do you want to meet in Melbourne, or Brisbane?

I have been looking for a project where I can transfer bitcoin to a thumb drive and burn it.
Some thing like the below Gif I made but with a thumb drive and more fire (on web cam):
 (wait for the Gif to reload)

 says $AUD deposits (and others) are *coming soon*.
Can you clarify if you accept $AUD local deposits and local withdrawals please.

You could buy bitcoin in Australian dollars via an Australian exchange and sell bitcoin via a Thailand exchange (no need for ozforex brokers, WU, moneygram).
You will lose at least 3% buying bitcoin and another 3+% when selling unless you use bitcoin to purchase things.
Here is an intro to bitcoin: 
You can compare the price and features of Australian exchanges here:

It depends on the fees charged.
Buying bitcoin with CHF might cost you 2-10%??? (I not familiar with Swiss bitcoin exchanges).
Selling bitcoin on an Australian exchanges can be done for a 0-2% fee:

Nice work guys, very innovative.

So you, are your upvoters, don't see a difference between cold hard cash (concrete thing), and bitcoin (abstract thing) as it all gets classed as "everything", but you depend on "concrete examples of abstract bitcoin" to prove it's being used to support terrorism?
That sounds like when you want things to match your ideology you lean towards classing "everything" as equal. When your ideology is threatened you solely depend on complex hierarchical structures to be simple.

Independent Reserve was the [best $AUD price 2 weeks ago and in the top 3 for the last week]( (comparing over a dozen '$AUD accepting' exchanges).
I hope his book gets published (I donated), IR lives on, and the people I work with in bitcoin were as cool as Adam was (I liked his car).

The closest I can think of is  but it might take a year or 2 for it to become more popular and get some decent items/stock level for sale (you won't find much computer hardware there now).
An existing computer store will hopefully adopt bitcoin as well.
What I have been thinking of starting is a bitcoin concierge service that is a simple website that allows bitcoin users to request items and I get them for the client.
There are things I want to buy but with eBay joining up with my local Woolworths I'm not sure I want to be data mined so personally.

You have both "Save The Seas" and "Sea Shepherd" in your list but they are both the same org. I do NOT want any tips thanks.

Yes that's right. LocalBitcoins.com is international, they have people in a lot of countries. 
You can buy from a person (you can meet them somewhere local to you in Australia) on LocalBitcoins.com and put the bitcoin in your wallet.
When you get to Thailand you give the bitcoin to  or  or even to someone on LocalBitcoins.com in Thailand for THB.
