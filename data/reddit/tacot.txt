Theory: one of the primary narratives propping up the shitcoin frenzy is that Bitcoin is "slow and expensive." And that's a very profitable narrative for them, because they're an exchange. So, perhaps the math works out such that the cost of maintaining that artificial narrative is actually less than the profit they earn from keeping the shitcoin show going. Or, at the very least, it dampens their motivation. Or, in other words: conflict of interest.

I think his concerns are valid, but I also think the current system could work itself out in a way that doesn't threaten Bitcoin's existence. It's difficult to predict what's going to happen, there's really no precedent. Cryptocurrencies will certainly be a mainstay of our financial future, so even if Bitcoin mining becomes co-opted we'll just boot up a new, more centralization-resistant altcoin.
Decentralized mining pools like p2pool also seem like a possible answer. I don't know very much about them, though.

One criticism: a transaction does not 'require' six confirmations to be 'valid'. Six confirmations just means the transaction is six-confirmations-secure. The number six is arbitrary (I think it was Satoshi who first recommended six as a sort of standard, since six is pretty damn secure.) One confirmation is secure enough for the vast majority of use cases.

I think it's possible that ultimately fees could be prohibitively expensive to make Bitcoin a feasible solution for transactions below a certain threshold (say $50.) But it's far too early to have a clear answer. I think the work Gavin is doing on invertible bloom tables has interesting implications for the cost miners associate with including transactions in their blocks. I wouldn't rule out a future in which fees are close to zero.

The process of buying and selling bitcoins for cash is made more convenient. It's a lot easier to follow the instructions written on the ATM than setting yourself up with an exchange, and for some people that's worth the ATM fee.

If Bitcoin fulfills its promise, its market cap will need to grow at least a couple orders of magnitude to accomodate that level of commerce. Stability is a function of liquidity, and Bitcoin's liquidity is pitifully low in the context of global currencies.

*Whether or not you agree with the idea of people controversial goods and services over the Internet doesn’t really matter because the technology is almost here and it will be, realistically speaking, impossible to stop. Governments will still be able to go after individual vendors when they slip up, but the actual marketplace will always stay open. The same technology that is going to replace eBay is also going to create the possibility of a Silk Road 2.0 that cannot be shutdown by any government.*
That's the point I wish someone would've made at the hearings. Not just with respect to marketplaces, but laundering. The technology is coming is there's nothing anyone can do about it. Whether it's zerocoin or some really sophisticated tumblers, "money laundering" is going to be so trivial once these ideas are implemented that there's no point in trying to regulate it. It's already pretty trivial with a bit of technical understanding. Regulators should focus on more important matters.

Yeah that's it. The reasoning guys like Marc Andreessen use to support valuations like this is that these apps have captured the **attention** of hundreds of millions or over a billion people, and with that attention comes incredible power. It's unclear to me how that power could be leveraged, but I agree that the idea of disappearing pics isn't the real value proposition, it's the the number of **eye balls** looking at them.

I think Marc Andreessen's [Why Bitcoin Matters]( is a solid introduction for intelligent-yet-skeptical people, and it's from the New York Times which is obviously very important.
Also, "How to Explain Bitcoin at a Cocktail Party" is a great intro for the general population:
*I say... the Internet makes everything better right? Email is better than sending letters, Google is better than card catalogs at a library. But we didn’t have real Internet money until recently. It turns out there was a really good reason: How do I know you didn't copy your Internet money and send it to someone else before you sent it to me? Meaning, you used the same money twice. Well this long standing problem only got solved a few years back by some unknown genius and now we have real Internet money. Soon the whole world will be using it, just like Email and Google.*

If I understand correctly, that would make bandwidth the new tps (transactions per second) bottleneck. For example, a miner creates a 100 MB block (approx. 150,000 txns.) So long as nodes have enough time to download it before the next block arrives (i.e. within 10 minutes), the network keeps chugging along. Therefore, Bitcoin's maximum velocity would increase from 7 tps to ~250 tps. Am I wrong?

Hi Andreas,
Given that regulators are targeting the intersection of bitcoin and fiat to enforce anti-money laundering measures, how do expect they'll react to a landscape where conversion with fiat is no longer necessary to conduct business and daily life?

“Money is one motivating factor for me. If it wasn’t I wouldn’t impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor. Money motivates me for two reasons. For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause. I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant. In fact, compared to most I know, I still live quite frugally. I buy better food at the grocery store now, and got some new clothes, and am more generous with my friends and loved ones, but I’ve always been a cheap ass, and still kinda am out of habit. Besides that, I don’t want the attention that buying big toys brings for security reasons.
More importantly, money is powerful, and it’s going to take power to affect the kinds of changes I want to see. Money allows us to expand our infrastructure and manpower to accommodate the growing demands of our market and to pursue paths that will compliment and strengthen what’s already been created here.
All that being said, my primary motivation is not personal wealth, but making a difference. As corny as it sounds, I just want to look back on my life and know that I did something worthwhile that helped people. It’s fulfilling to me. If you don’t know this joy, you may hear my words as insincere and as a way to manipulate, but I know they are true and resonate with some of you. There is nothing wrong with living your life to maximize your own pleasure, so long as you aren’t hurting anyone in the process, but you will miss out on higher levels of happiness if your focus is always on yourself. It’s paradoxical, but the less you focus on your own happiness and focus on others’, the happier you’ll be. Try it out, you can always go back to being selfish. :)”

Mining isn't meant to be efficient, it's meant to be equal. The more equally miners can participate, the more secure the network becomes, and vice versa. The protocol should (and is) designed in such a way to minimize competitive advantages like this.

Yes.  And this won't be a problem because everyday items will eventually be quoted in a different unit system to accommodate our animal brains.  So instead of paying 0.0000031 for a loaf of bread, businesses will slap a symbol in front and charge you μ8.45 for example.

Where can I find these stats?
@_date: 2013-10-11 03:40:55
I agree with you.  However, the time between 3. and 4. could be very long, especially if one party happens to be a Bitcoin millionnaire with a lot of patience.  Joe Potsmoker doesn't have a lot of savings and can't afford to keep 1 BTC locked up indefinitely, so eventually he buckles and the millionnaire profits.  I bet if you were to calculate the average "buckling" time, it would be a profitable investment for those who can afford to keep a lot of coins locked up indefinitely.
A counterargument would be that the Bitcoin millionnaire has better ways to spend his time than extorting little fish.  This is valid.  However, I suppose he could outsource the extortion to a group whose time it's worth.
This, however, is where the reputation system comes in.  I think that, in addition to the system you described, work very well together.
