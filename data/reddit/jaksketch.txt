Thanks, that’s helpful.
Do you have a link to multisig with Trezor/Electrum so I can learn more?
I like the paper the most since I’m not using it to make transactions (I just keep a small amount in coinbase if I need to buy something). 
      -for paper, I read something about it being more dangerous than wallets like electrum when you go to add it all to a hot wallet when you want to cash out. Is this true?
A more basic question... the paper method makes one address and it’s not like a wallet? So the xPub would only ever see that one address and if I wanted another I just roll the dice again?
I’m just trying to figure it the easiest and most secure method.
    -offline electrum with tails seems good but complicated and I read some reports about how government agencies have put malware infecting usb and such. 
     -paper seems the most secure for cold storage, just worried about what some people said about how it’s more dangerous when you spend it. 
      -Trezor seems secure and as easy as paper, but for some reason (probably unnecessarily) I’m worried about the programmers slipping something on to either capture seed phrases or make it so the randomness is not as random as you think.

I just copied it from coinbase. I deposited over a year ago and sent a couple times last month. That’s why I was wondering if there system was different than paper, like renewed a different address or something.

It showed up as 0 transactions.

It seems safer to me since I don’t know code and can’t check what Trezor/Ledger are doing. I can just use an air gapped computer to make an address and then send money to it from wherever.

Ok, thanks for the help, I’ll look into multisig. 
Just a last question, when you said  to use Trezor and roll dice, do you mean together? Like create the seed with the dice and then recover with Trezor instead of letting Trezor make it? And then using Trezor to make an addition pass for the 25th?

Thanks, address reuse helps me understand better. Seems like I am now choosing between Trezor and AES encrypted offline usb/steel wallet.

I could at least make sure it’s completely offline until time to withdraw. The only thing is ensuring it is completely random and not some huge set of possible keys inside a set of parameters that is easier to brute force. 
What about making a random code using a proper dictionary and dice, and then offline on airgapped computer using a bip39 conversion to make sure it’s all good?

That sounds good. 
I was also just thinking... if I bought a Trezor could I update firmware and then plug it into a usb battery or something to set it up, and then make a copy of the private key and wipe it?
