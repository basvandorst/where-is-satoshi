Yes, 6 confirmations.  Enter your mtgox address in to the search box on blockchain.info to see how many it has so far.  Also, stating you use Silk Road publicly is stupid, don't be surprised if mtgox searches for that deposit amount and freezes your account and reports you to police.

Did you ever visit any other website in another browser window or tab in the same browser while you were logged into Coinbase? Do you have Flash or Java plugins enabled in this browser?  
If you're lucky, Coinbase has a hole in their API that makes weak keys or allows commands without authentication.  More likely, your computer was compromised and the API key was used because it's easier than breaking the 2-factor.

Depends on each machine's hashrate. If it's too small, you will either rarely get a p2pool share, or a few shares that pay small dust amounts that require high transaction fees in order to spend.  Unless you have a good reason, it's probably best to all mine to one address.

decentralized market stimulus. you spend bitcoins on products and services you value to get them in more hands. you try to choose merchants who believe in bitcoin and won't sell all.  then they increase the value of bitcoin for everyone and bring more people to bitcoin.

You're completely right.  We don't need Bitcoin to take down the government, the government's doing a perfectly good job of that on its own.  Who's left to tax if everyone's on welfare?  The snake eats its own tail.  The government seizes funds from its own pensions to pay interest on the bonds in the pension to pretend it's not defaulting.  What Bitcoin does is provide solidity, a crystal clear face, acting like a mirror so the snake sees it's eating itself and pukes itself out again.  Central banks realize they lost control of their own creation, but not before transferring title of most of the world resources to a select few.  It's time to expose fraud and theft in all asset classes, and hopefully a block chain of title can hold the same mirror to the stock market, mortgages, and mineral rights.  What I am saying is this is not an attack on government or banks or corporations per se, just on evil, thanks for your help, even unintentional.

I don't use blockchain, but it sounds like you are trying to send to or from the private key of the paper wallet. Just do a regular bitcoin send to the _address_ of the paper wallet. The address is calculated from the public key. Don't enter your private key on a website unless you trust that site with all the funds at that key.

Ignore this guy, mining is profitable (for now). Miners often try to discourage more miners, as it leaves more profit for them.  You will want an AMD graphics card, or an FPGA, or an ASIC.  Then you need mining software, and for anything to happen soon, a pool.  Do your research by reading guides and join mining specific forums.

Almost right. A deteministic wallet allows you to back up your wallet once, and automatically regenerate all private keys from the backup.  The downside is, if someone steals your wallet, they have all the future private keys you may generate from it.  Electrum and Armory use different deterministic wallets, while the Satoshi client (bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt) does not yet support deterministic wallets.  It generates all private keys at random.  This is why you should back up your Satoshi client wallet every so often.

Banning IPs from tor on btc-e only seems to affect the public chat box. You should still be able to log in, send and reply to PM, deposit, withdraw and trade.  They aren't targetting you, remain calm and use common words and be clear in the message to support as English is not their first language.
Specifically say you checked the tx and it did not go to the blockchain because you made a typo and you want the BTC credited to your account.

I wouldn't use ixcoins because the creator mined a lot before letting anyone else know about them. If these have not been demonstrably donated to eliminate that problem, and merged mining has not been implemented to prevent wild swings in hashrate, then I fear your ixcoins aren't worth the disk space they consume, and running the software, not worth the CPU cycles.

Agreed.  Inflation rewards debt, spending, pushy advertising.  Debt money grows an environment of dog eat dog to get that next interest payment that mathematically does not exist so has to be borrowed into existence by a select few or obtained by ruthless methods.  In contrast Bitcoin rewards saving, wise investing, and quality.

Posting about a rare positive result in no way tempts me to ever play.  Clearly many more than 1920 BTC were lost to afford to pay you.  Those losing hands will never post as much as the lucky ones.  Gambling on random outcomes you have no control over is utter insanity.  The popularity of this activity worldwide says a lot about the effectiveness of psychological manipulation over correct math.  Can the creativity-lacking and easily bored, really not think of anything productive to use coins for?  Start a business, make loans, or hoard in cold storage.  As Dr. Paul said on an interview recently (paraphrasing), you don't need to sacrifice to help society, one of the best things to do is to be successful.    
Gambling your coins away won't make you successful.  Winning and posting about it won't help others but feeds the insanity.  Perhaps you believe in a concept called "luck" whereby sometimes math doesn't work anymore.  If you have too many coins, please consider donating to one of these organizations:

I recommend obtaining and studying the design of the IBB Cheque. It's pretty, it has a scratch-off private key and a place to write the amount:

The way to kill bitcoin is for everyone to be trustworthy and generous.  We won't need mining to secure transactions if no one would ever double spend.  We don't need a monetary unit to smoothen trading if every resource is given freely.  This requires people to do boring jobs for no pay just to help others.  Also all rich must actually work and have no secret ways to commit fraud.  All bureaucracy and red tape must be shut down to eliminate drain on society.  Soldiers must refuse to obey.  These things will free up enough resources to bootstrap a fully gift economy.  Bitcoin protects us from corruption.  End corruption and we no longer need Bitcoin.  The word of an honest man has less overhead.

To make a true offline wallet you can't just make a wallet, encrypt it, move it to USB and delete the original.  Before you make the wallet, install Armory then disconnect the computer from the network.  Then never connect to a network again until you're done using the wallet. Save a watching-only copy to USB.  Use Armory on a different computer to open the watching-only copy, create transactions and bring them to the offline computer to be signed (authorized).  Then bring them back to the online computer to transmit (broadcast).  This way there is no way anyone can remotely access your wallet, and even if malicious software was already on the offline computer, the only thing it can do is mess with your USB stick (so check the transaction right before you broadcast it).

Look into BIP32, it will make your life a lot easier. 
The user could assign one extended public key to your site, and then the site could assign sub-keys automatically, allowing senders to generate a new address to pay the user each time.  
I do agree it's a security risk. One solution would be to have the user sign a statement, with the key for one of their public addresses, verifying the additional addresses (or extended public key) belongs to them. That would allow this information to be posted without trusting your site.

If you leave the client open it will resend it every 30 min or so until it's included in a block. You won't see it in the client history until you it's included in a block and you download that block. Check the receiving address on blockchain.info to check while waiting.

Your TX was not mined and possibly not relayed.  It's not present in the memory pool: search transaction ID here: 
Make sure you're running the latest Bitcoin-QT.  I recommend adding network peers, by forwarding TCP port 8333 from your router to your computer, then restarting Bitcoin-QT, and some more nodes should connect to you.  If that doesn't work, you may want to add some peers manually from 
Make sure to keep your Bitcoin-QT running, because it retransmits the transaction every 30 minutes until it's confirmed.  
You can check your debug.log in your bitcoin directory for any messages related to the transaction.  It sounds like your wallet was corrupted and may have made an invalid transaction. Back up your wallet, then try running Bitcoin-QT -salvagewallet.  Worst case, you can export a private key or two and import them into a new wallet, then create a new transaction.

1. locate correct bitcoin directory. 
2. back up the wallet.dat file there now by copying it to another location, then delete it from the data directory
3. copy in possible corrupted wallet.dat to the data directory. 
4. run at a command line: bitcoin-qt -salvagewallet (on windows run: C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe -salvagewallet ). This attempts to recover keys from the wallet.dat.

Yes, a free floating exchange rate means we'll have fluctuation.  Look at the Second Life Linden Dollar, basically pegged around 250 L$ per USD.  It's stable but that means it loses purchasing power at the same rate.  Not a good long term store.  If you worry BTC price may drop, sell some proportion of your bitcoins as often as you like until you are comfortable.  Or, enter into a contract with someone who is worried about a rapid price spike: called an option, the contract allows one of you to choose to buy (or sell, depending on the contract) a specific amount of bitcoin at a later date at a fixed price.  Sites exist to match people wanting to trade these contracts (icbit.se and mpex.co) but you can also find someone you trust directly (such as on bitcoin-otc.com).

You can layer microtransactions on top of Bitcoin, so this will be possible and common.  Check out this thread:  
Alternately, you can use Ripple today, although it's very new, and less anonymous than Bitcoin.  Ripple provides faster confirmations due to using consensus of nodes instead of mining. See ripple.com, and realize while many bitcoiners are against ripple for having a centralized anti-spam token currency, it's not a big deal, because there's plenty of it, and bots hand it out.  The other objection is lack of source code, but they promised to release it.
