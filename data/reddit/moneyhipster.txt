Yes, they use payment processors without chargeback to send fiat payments between users.
They are working with Okpay for first implementation, but integrate others is as easy as develop a plugin (that is what they say). Dwolla, PerfectMoney, Alipay or WebMoney are just a few of examples. Paypal of course is not supported due to it's arbitration process for any payment.

Last week the project was selected for the startup-showcase on CoinSummit at London, togheter with Chain.com, Swarm among many other disruptive projects. (btw, Chain.com also rocks so much!)
Cryptoarticles liked the project so much at CoinSummit that they interviewed to the CTO of the project last week:
