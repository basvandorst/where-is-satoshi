Most europeans use Coinbase/GDAX and then binance for alt coins (myself included, works fine).

Shh, this is r/bitcoin, we only accept bitcoin shilling!

A few hours ago Binance registration were open, are they already closed? That was quick, lol. But why should Coinbase be illegal in germany?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:56:06
Illegal means it's against the law. If it's in the user agreement Coinbase simply doesn't want you, as a german, to use their service. German law probably doesn't give a shit. There are easily hundreds of germans in this sub who don't give a shit either and use Coinbase anyway. It's not like they stop you.
But it's still a valid reason to use a different exchange. I don't know much about Bitpanda, but make sure Binance registration is still closed, because it's basically the king of altcoin trading.

You transfered money to be part of the revolution. OK. But the revolution will fail if the price doesn't stop going down. So the price is important for you.

Money is used colloquially. "Making money", the phrase I used, implies an individuals increasing capability to obtain goods and services. As this provides a high amount of safety and comfort, "making money" is usually considered to be a very desirable goal.
Now please tell me why you own crypto even though you think its price doesn't matter, would ya!?
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:11:05
That's true. The gold price is certainly inflated compared to its utility alone. But I believe my point still stands. Bitcoin can become worthless over night, gold can not.

Let's say you invest a random amount into coin X today. What could happen within 1 year?
It moons. You made a mistake for not investing much more. You could have been a multimillionaire! You are sad.
It fails. You made a mistake for not investing into coin Y instead, which mooned. You could have been a multimillionaire! You are sad.
You can't think in terms of maximizing your gains if you want to be remotely happy with the outcome. No matter what you do, it will always turn out that you should have invested much more/nothing at all.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:42:15
And if the price doesn't stop going down you will lose everything you were afraid to be stolen by your government. Stop being a hypocrite.

Valid arguments, here is what I think:
The fees will decrease depending on new technology, as stated by OP. Whether these new features are successful doesn't depend on you buying crypto. Paying programmers would have been more useful.
Second point. As long as people are willing and excited to use crypto as soon as the technology is mature enough it doesn't matter whether they own crypto before that's the case. An individual, who is already convinced about the advantages of crypto, won't increase its adoption by buying crypto. Again, spending fiat to help crypto development is more helpful than buying crypto and keeping it.

Wait, so you send 0.1BTC to someone hoping he would return its value in USD after he made it clear that he doesn't want to use PayPal protection?
I am sorry what happened to you, and this guy is indeed an asshole, but I have a feeling you needed this lesson.

Teachers, policemen, firefighters, infrastructure, ...
"Fighting the system" is usually an excuse for being arrogant and greedy, which makes you part of the system. Pay your taxes. Fight waste of tax money, definitely, fight the power of banks, surely, but pay your taxes.

XRB (Raiblocks): No fees, instant and unlike IOTA it actually works right now. Finished product. Fully scalable. Only needs prettier wallet and better exchanges. Twelve people are working on it full time, both business and developers. It's what bitcoin was meant to be. Just as a heads up, stick with BTC if you want to.
Edit: Oh, and shops are actively reaching out to XRB devs and ask them what they need to do in order do be able to accept XRB as payment.
@_date: 2018-09-27 19:03:25
So we have to trust the bitcoin developers to not exploit the bugs they find. 
Bitcoin -- putting the trust back in trustless cryptocurrencies!
Oh, I'm sorry, it's called "[benevolence]( these days. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 22:34:53
So you say a miner wouldn't want to exploit a bug to get rich because he needs the network up and running so he can earn some pocket money every month. Makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:01:06
My initial post said that the majority of people who own crypto want to make money because all other crypto related activities can be done without owning crypto. Therefore, the price matters. You argument now says that we should be happy because even with at $5000 we would be up buy 500%. 
I'm sorry, but that perfectly proves my point. You think in terms of making money. The price is a important for you. The only difference is that you are happy making money in the long term.
Also keep in mind that BTC was once worth 0.001$ per coin. So if we go down to $0.01 per coin, we are still up by 1000% over ~10years. That's insanely good. I have a feeling, a lot of people would have problems with BTC at $0.01.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:23:51
All these things don't require you to invest into BTC. One could follow the news, participate in the community, read up on everything crypto and help with the code. One can be fascinated by the technology, look at block chain info and follow the processing of individual transactions. Spend fake coins on the testnet. **All without owning a single satoshi.**
The only thing which requires you to invest into BTC is your wish to make money. And then the price suddenly becomes very important.
So, let's stop being hypocrites. If we own crypto it's for one reason alone.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:15:23
That's totally fine. But it's enough to buy crypto once that is actually possibly. If you own crypto today you want the price to go up.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:48:32
I can agree with that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:59:56
So you are going to hire private security guards? You realize that is going to be much, much more expensive than paying taxes, right? But  of course you are not going to do that, because you rely on everybody else to pay their taxes. All you are is yet another greedy asshole who hides behind "fight da system, hurr durr, ain't going to pay no taxes, hurr durr" ape speech.

You genuinely think that every single teacher is "a power tripping asshole who likes to oppress kids"? How would you teach people? Or stop fires from spreading? Protect people who can't protect themselves? You realize that you pretty much want an anarchy where every human who is not a 16-45yo man is pretty much fish fodder? Where society will revert to the dark ages?

Gold has inherent value because it can be used for various applications independent of some abstract market value.
It is a highly conductive, noncorroding metal which is going to be useful for many decades to come. Bitcoin does not have a similar safety net. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:06:22
I know it will definitely be very unpredictable!

My thought? People have now Idea what a market cap is. It is NOT the total amount of money put into a coin. It's "total amount of coins times last trade price".
If I have 1 million Grummler Coins, and sell one Coin to my brother for $1 telling him it's the next big thing, then BOOM market cap 1  million.
Consider this an educational rant :)
