You can, but I believe outgoing transactions is where it gets tricky, your regular electrum wallet can receive from your segwit wallet, and if the receiving wallet support segwit I believe they can to, but if they don't I don't think it ends well for your coins. Hence why people are so adamant about exchanges accepting segwit so they can use it to cut fee costs.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:13:28
That's Fucking awesome, I would love to do this someday
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:37:17
Thank you sir, you as well.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:51:02
make a new wallet, and pick segwit instead of regular
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:26:27
Dude segwit has been live on electrum since 3.0 a While ago.

100% shady
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:59
You are correct it is a great time to buy it, just make sure you buy actual Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash (its an altcoin like etherium or litecoin) so you don't get duped. Price should be going back up soon.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:09:44
This is the pattern that has been repeating since I came in around $600 a coin, bitcoin gets under attack, everyone tries to jump ship and then a week later everyone who manager to hold on is rewarded with All time highs in price, over and over again it has repeated. It's probably a very good thing you didn't sell because we will probably see a bounce back to around 20k. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:48
Ya its hella shady Insider Trading level stuff going on.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:23:37
I'd suggest Bitcoin, reasoning is most of the other coins are based on it, so believe in any of them also means you basically believe in the original, but do your own research and then decide what to do.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:12:49
He was saying the accrinim you typed was BBC which isn't a ticker for any coins, Bitcoin Cash was what you meant, and no I don't believe you can get your money back after sending it to the wrong address type. It would be like putting chuck-e-cheese coins in a vending machine. (and to answer your question to Chocolate Bitconnect is another Altcoin that is not Bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:35:32
BCC is Bitconnect, BCH is Bitcoin Cash and BTC is Bitcoin, just fyi =) and i'm glad to hear you got your coins, best of luck my dude
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:39:38
Because that would go against what we all want. The solution will be coming soon in the mean time everyone needs to calm down
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:28
People over at Bcash had inside information that coinbase was going to release the Bcash today. Then Coinbase conveniently locked selling, while allowing buying so there was no resistance up until 9500, where it looks like either the market froze or the Bcash network went down, either way its a shit show today, but it will probably be sorted out in a week or so.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:04:48
It's because we are under attack right now, in a few days it will be more managable, and when lightning releases it will fix most of this

Its basically another currency, so it would be what people determine to be fair, .0000050bitcoin for a burger maybe? eventually it will be its own currency you can use just like dollars
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:15:01
top 2 people suggest on here are Mycelium or Electrum
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:21:37
There are a lot of people who came here and jumped in because of FOMO but never took the time to learn, so now when stuff like this happens its blaring that having enough knowledge of the space is absolutely important.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:35:45
The network is congested, it will take time to process your transaction right now
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:36:24
Yes it is under attack
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:00:43
You will probably have to wait, and if it takes too long then you will get your money back and the transaction will expire
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:15
I'm having the same issue, the network is under attack right now, but It won't go down. Just might take an extra day or two to get your transaction through, I'd just relax and watch a movie or two while it gets sorted out.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:00:17
Bitcoin network is currently under attack with spam transactions, in order to send you have to pay pretty high fees right now, just give it a couple days and it should be more reasonable, and then you can move your funds
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:18:19
If it's partially completed then that probably means your banks already sent the funds, and your exchange is just finalizing the details on their end, so my guess would say No, but if there is a giant red Cancel button on the page it shows your transaction feel free to give it a shot too
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:42
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:50:10
from my experience when a tx expires it goes back into your wallet, and if it takes too long it will expire.

(keeping everyone in the loop as best I can)
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:30:45
And it will continue to go up, with every attack like this we become more resilient to it in the future.

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:13
Yes the fundamentals of the coin are flawed
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:58:20
The miners right now get both all the transaction fees within the block and the block reward, once there is no more reward they will still get all the fees which should be more than enough to keep them incentivized. Then you have people like me who will mine regardless of profit because I like helping the network
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:12:51
I'm surprised someone who was making so much money decided his opinion was more important than his business, and you are as always entitled to your opinion my dude.

How did you get bitcoin on there if you never uploaded a photo id?

That is not what r/btc looks like right now
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:46:28
Then go OTC?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:51:44
Very true. Risk vs convenience. I'm going to only be using them to buy/sell and I probably wont need to do that too much longer so once I'm done ill have them delete my account and info. Up to you what your needs are.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:02
Coinbase won't let you dump it, but you can conveniently buy as much Bcash as you want with no sell wall...
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:32:12
Gemini is the exchange everyone is running to for buying/selling Bitcoins, I like to use poloniex for BTC to other coins but opinions for that vary here, and taking your coins on coinbase, transfering them to Gdax the exchange behind the company, and then transfering from Gdax is the cheapest way to move off coinbase right now
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:34:45
Lol just for the newbie
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:39:59
2 people have messaged me for it, and one has sent something to it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:25
If coinbase would let me send the shit I would gladly.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:28:18
There was insider trading yesterday between coinbase and the bitcoin cash crew, so now everyone is gunshy on coinbase and moving to gemini. In other news Bcash in on a temp rise until coinbase finally allows users to actually sell the stuff, and bitcoin is taking a healthy dip before a strong recovery after the network spamming attack
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:23
The big debate was the block size, Bitcoin is I believe 1MB blocks, whatever the actual size it's always full because of our volume so fees had to be added to incentivize miners to add transactions into the first blocks mined, Bcash said why dont we just increase the block size so it's not an issue, but that would mean once that fills up they just keep making it bigger and bigger. The reason this is an issue is because the bigger it gets the less a normal computer can run it, it would be handled by a farm of computers which are fixed at a point (ie a plot of land that is centralized) and then governments can come in to either destroy it or control it, so you can see long term it won't work. In the intrum they say that they fixed the fee issue we are having right now, but the only reason this is true is the same with their block size, they dont have nearly as many people as we do so we are finding better solutions to the problem then a quick fix. Hope this helps you understand why people here aren't fond of Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:27:59
The Bcash crew had inside knowledge that coinbase was going to release the Bcash today, hence the attack out of nowhere. Now one of 2 things is happening either A: Coinbase techs messed up and we can't sell Bcash but people can still buy it or B: Coinbase is letting Bcash numbers climb while there is no resistance on the sell side. Either way its not a fun day to watch the charts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:10:46
It probably expired and returned it to your wallet
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:45
Do not buy any. It is a hostile altcoin that wants nothing but to try to overthrow Bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency. I wouldn't touch it with a 10ft pole and someone else is holding the pole...
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:37:57
Just tested it again just for you, no they are not
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:11:24
You usually have to wait a week when buying Bitcoin through an exchange because they have to go through your bank which are notorious with red tape for these kinds of things.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:45:52
Someone here understands username relevance 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:53
Its very technical but you can still mine Bitcoin, I personally use a service called Cloud Mining where you use someone elses hardware, and buy the processing power from them. Its convenient for me, but not for everyone, and they take a cut of your pay for maintaining the equipment for you but I understand it's not too popular on this sub, You are welcome to message me if you'd like more info on it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:36:59
Everyone else has the same feeling
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:35:03
Yes they will, prob to around 200-300sat/byte like we had before the spam attack
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:04:17
That is concerning, with that long and no confirmations it could expire, If you can pay a bit more to increase the mining fee I would do so. If not you just have to hope and pray
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:20

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:40:00
There will be a huge dump as soon as coinbase lets us, believe me everyone has their fingers on the firing button already
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:08:13
That sounds pretty tough. Might have to find someone with an unused ID to help you out

It was more than just the correction
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:56
Ya it's insider trading at it's finest. Just move away from coinbase to another exchange, the best way to voice how you feel is bring your business elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:35:07
They are private wallets, so that you actually own the bitcoin instead of it being on the exchange
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:14:18
You should never store your bitcoin on an exchange anyways, they should only be used to buy or sell the coins, the storage should be done on hardware or software wallets, or for larger amounts in offline wallets like paper wallets. Sorry to see you go my dude.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:41:45
The Gdax exchange is allowing trading of Bcash and has been for an hour or 2 now, you just cant sell from coinbase. Its looking marginally healthy at 3600 with more fair numbers on each side, but as soon as coinbase flips the switch it will dump
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:12:08
yup, its just waiting in line to be verified, but the network is under a lot of congestion right now so it will take a bit. All transactions with a higher fee will be before yours, and all with less will be behind it. I'd just kick back and check it tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:22:10
I use electrum, and I know they have segwit, and I see a lot of people on here suggest mycelium but I have no idea about it since I use elec XD But going to their pages will probably shed some light
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:59:49
Maybe because it mostly goes up? maybe because they believe in the underlying tech, I think it's a company by company question.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:24:08
If you have more than 1 at this point you probably just sit back and watch

@_date: 2017-12-20 10:00:30
Just like Bobanaut said, anytime you have a company conducting investigations on itself is HUGE red flags, have an unbiased 3rd party conduct the investigation and I guarantee they find some shenanigans, but just saying "I'll look into my own pockets to make sure I didn't steal from you" is stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:05:50
They did say they were going to do this at the time the fork happened you know? Like everyone knew this was coming, its just the timing during an attack on bitcoin is unfortunate.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:49:16
Honestly if people take the time to learn it, then they understand. I believe our best "advocate" for educating people about it is Andreas but in terms of an elected spokesperson to lead them bitcoin doesn't have one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:23:33
That fee should be fine, should be any time now it starts to confirm
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:00:06
No I do not.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:31
We are all poor
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:03
its all based off satoshi/byte, that's what the miners look for when verifying your transaction because they get your transaction fee once they verify it, so higher fee means more money for then, so those get pushed to the front of the line.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:20
Bitcoin is absolutely better, the reason they look like they do right now is the people over at BCH are coordinating an attack mixed with some insider trading to fudge the numbers.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:57:42
He always has, but he is a shitty person and anyone who watches him enough can see that. For me anyone like that running something is enough for me to avoid it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:09:47
The string of numbers and letters is your transaction ID, with it you can see the address it was sent to.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:59:09
I don't know of any exchange that you can buy from that can just take your credit card and give you the BTC there are strict money laundering laws these exchanges have to adhere to, hence why they need all your info. Sorry my dude
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:31:29
Use [this video]( to learn how to make a paper wallet and put that in the stockings, however since people have a tendancy to lose these kinds of things make sure you make a copy of them just incase, and keep those copies safe. I've seen too many stories of people giving their family 2btc on these wallets and everyone loses it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:13:10
People over at Bcash had inside information that coinbase was going to release the Bcash today. Then Coinbase conveniently locked selling, while allowing buying so there was no resistance up until 9500, where it looks like either the market froze or the Bcash network went down, either way its a shit show today, but it will probably be sorted out in a week or so.

At the time of the fork they said they would release it Jan 2018, they release it early (my speculation says this was insider trading because someone at Bcash knew it was going to happen today) Hence the pump today and the coordinated attack.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:58
Basically insider trading going on.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:20:04
The people a BCH own the Bitcoin.com site, the actual BTC site is Bitcoin.org, and the BCH team intentionally did this to trick newcomers into buying their coin instead of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:57:20
anytime my dude
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:46:07
It was more than a dip my dude
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:28:07
If a site didn't set up enough security before and got itself hacked, it probably doesn't deserve your business. There are safer places to keep your coins like in a private wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:44:50
No but I think that mentality makes up the majority of bitcoin users when the price can go up 50% in a month. No one wants to be the pizza guy
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:33:13
None that I know unless the software you used to send it allows that kind of thing. If they do you can probably find it on the software.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:12:32
Your fee was ~44sat/byte, but the rate right now since shenanigans are happening is closer to 400, so it might take a few days for your transaction to clear.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:00
Sadly I believe I am too after this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:35:23
You're probably going to have to wait until the BCH attack ends in the next couple of days
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:46
At least now you know, they named their coin that to intentionally have newcomers make this kind of mistake, It's really unfortunate but they really hate bitcoin for some reason.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:53:29

@_date: 2017-12-21 00:36:17
You mean you don't have an address where you live?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:39:27
It might be a bit more, but you can't do much with it right now, you'd still have to get verified by an exchange and thats going to take a few days so better start the process now than later
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:40:14
Can't do anything about the attack right now my dude, once lightning hits Bcash will stop these silly attacks but until then its a weakness of the network. I hope your transaction comes through before that
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:55:53
They just put up some huge red flags to the community, it looks like the consensus here is to move over to Gemini
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:24:44
You can't yet until they unlock everything
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:37
Ya it won't let you sell yet. but the price is back down to 3207 so you were locked out the entire time everyone else made their fortune XD I will not be using coinbase after this.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:16:19
There are already people working on it, check out the lightning network it is almost ready
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:06:44
I also had this issue, it took longer than expected but it finally showed up in my account. Should just take a bit longer than expected.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:28:03
If you're in the space long enough you learn the things you need to learn, some faster and some slower.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:10
You can't even cash it to fiat until they unlock it on their end, which was supposed to be an hour ago but there have been "issues" 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:16:16
Dude chocolate you always make me laugh man. Keep being you!
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:27:21
Future forks shouldn't effect your decision unless there is a specific thing a coin you mostly like does but a fork fixes the issues you have with that coin. I don't like the people running Bcash and I feel like the fundamental solution to the problem they tried to fix is flawed and cursed to fail in the long term, but do your own research and find your own results.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:42:19
Omg my eyes thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:36:23
bitcoin is under a spam attack right now, so its going to take a couple days for your transaction to go through most likely
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:46:45
Then they should just buy OTC
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:19
How much did you pay for fees in sat/byte, if the number was low then it will take a while to confirm because bitcoin is under attack from the Bcash community so fees are high right now. Might take a few days to have it calm down so in the mean time relax and wait for the storm to pass.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:25:24
While their team sits around and won't let us sell Bcash, everyone is allowed to buy it and the price has been pumped like crazy, It almost feels like coinbase is in on this...
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:13:45
Well then I would give it a few days and try again, this attack should blow over and then you can more reasonably move your funds
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:29:51
You can buy it from someone who has bitcoin. Tell you what, set up a private wallet with Electrum or Mycelium and give me the bitcoin address to send coins to, and I will give you $10 in btc
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:12:04
I would stay far away from Bcash
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:03:30
You definitely want to buy Bitcoin if that was your intention and you can afford to lose the $50, but at this time using Gemini is probably better than Coinbase. I would also give it a few days because Bcash is attacking the bitcoin network with spam transactions, so maybe around xmas time actually buy it, but set up your account now. Once you buy it on the exchange send it to a private wallet using either Electrum or Mycelium that way you actually own the coins

Its just a pattern that's been repeating since I first got in. Attack happens -&gt; weak hands jump sides -&gt; BTC recovers and everyone comes back -&gt; price shoots up. It usually doesn't last more than a few days because you waste money clogging the network like this so once it ends it wont be fixed, but it will at least be more reasonable.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:01
No idea, trying to figure it out myself
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:41:32
17.4 right now, looks to be recovering slowly, this was quite an attack though

Coinbase still wont let us sell the coin yet
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:54:49
This can't be good...
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:14:58
The big debate was the block size, Bitcoin is I believe 1MB blocks, whatever the actual size it's always full because of our volume so fees had to be added to incentivize miners to add transactions into the first blocks mined, Bcash said why dont we just increase the block size so it's not an issue, but that would mean once that fills up they just keep making it bigger and bigger. The reason this is an issue is because the bigger it gets the less a normal computer can run it, it would be handled by a farm of computers which are fixed at a point (ie a plot of land that is centralized) and then governments can come in to either destroy it or control it, so you can see long term it won't work. In the intrum they say that they fixed the fee issue we are having right now, but the only reason this is true is the same with their block size, they dont have nearly as many people as we do so we are finding better solutions to the problem then a quick fix. Hope this helps you understand why people here aren't fond of Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:54:03
Amazon can't because their margins are so low the fees don't make sense right now, as for businesses they usually believe in any form of payment they can accept is a good one, so why turn away a customer because you can't accept their currency.

@_date: 2017-12-21 01:05:27
That's what it looks like. I mean they literally bought Bitcoin.com to try to trick newbies into buy Bcash instead of Bitcoin. and their Bitcoin.com wallet defaults to Bcash
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:04:15
Miner preference low = longer wait time for verifications, confidence level 80% means its sent from a trusted source

That one may be a bit tricky, If she doesn't have a wallet and you want to send something like that online I would protect hers with a password and maybe call her so only she knows it (by that I mean done include the password in the email or however you send it) that way you can safely send it online without someone in the middle finding it and wiping it before your kid can get it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:49
It sadly appears to be the case, unless they had a major breakdown in the coding allowing you to sell it seems they are not letting you which make a questionable appearance when you can buy bcash with no sell wall in place since we can't dump...
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:53
Yes but you can't dump them as of yet
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:02:50
But you can't send now? Sorry when I did my coinbase account you did all of this before you got an address
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:25
Do you expect them to steal the domain or something, we are a decentralized system, there are no common rules or ethics, there is no higher figure we can run to when shit like this happens, all we can do is try to educate anyone who stumbles into the subreddit about what is actually happening, and hope too many don't fall into the trap at the entrance door.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:47:36
Lol good luck my dude
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:46:03
I did it, it's a necessary curse when trusting someone with your banking info they need your info to use it. If you aren't comfortable using an online exchange you can always sell it OTC using craigslist or facebook or something else.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:19:55
Bitcoin.com is for bitcoin cash, they intentionally did this to trick newcomers, the actual website is bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:17:38
Ya I've had 2 transactions that expired like that, and both times they stayed for about a day after before they disappeared. Congrats on getting your coins back
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:16:38
Did you really think that investing in something you wouldn't have to pay taxes on it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:04:23
They said in the FAQ that if this happened before they released the BCH then they would add it to your now online BCH wallet, but after the fact it's damn tricky to unravel from another wallet. How much did he send?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:20:22
Anytime my dude.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:17
If the service you sent it with allows for that, then yes, but do you really need the $50 so fast you're willing to spend more than 20% of it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:41:01
You have to upload a pic of your DL for any exchange, they have to have it for bank account transfers.

in all honesty I still hate converting mBTC to actual BTC.

"Sufficient liquidity" but you can't add any liquidity until they unlock it on their end... Yet there was plenty of liquidity to buy Bcash as soon as the flood gates opened. You can't tell me that doesn't look fishy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:49:39
Anytime my dude
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:28:39
BCH is spamming the market right now, in a few days fees should settle a bit, and then your transaction should clear.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:53:35
We actually knew they were going to do this since the time of the fork. They said Jan 2018, instead they did it in the middle of an attack, and kept people from creating a sell resistance so the price shot through the roof, which is extremely fishy (looks like someone on the other side had privy info about it)
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:14:47
People over at Bcash had inside information that coinbase was going to release the Bcash today. Then Coinbase conveniently locked selling, while allowing buying so there was no resistance up until 9500, where it looks like either the market froze or the Bcash network went down, either way its a shit show today.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:27:10
Lmao that would require enough people selling to drop then numbers that much, with all the "holding" mentality on here I don't think there are enough coins in circulation to make those kinds of swings in the market.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:33:51
Your transaction has low fees, so its going to take it a while to clear because bitcoin is under a network spamming attack right now. Don't worry it will pass in a few days until then your transaction will probably not clear. if it does take too long your transaction will just expire which from my experience returns the funds back to your wallet
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:07:43
you mean bcash? the ticker is BCH for Bcash, BTC for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:48:44
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:28:43
From my experience if its not confirmed for too long it will expire and go back to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:07:05
The fees are an issue because people should be able to send for less then they are right now, but the volume means we are blocks behind in terms of waiting transactions, so the fees are used to try to inceitivize miners to add your transactions to faster blocks because its more profitable for them to finish the high fee ones first. This means for your transaction to not take a day to clear you have to pay quite a bit compared to 6 months ago where volume was less, and people are impatient sometimes XD

Ya its a real issue

Its the insider trading that people are upset about
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:08:09
They actually did announce right after the fork that Jan 2018 they would release everyone's BCH
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:24:06
I've been using their platform for over 3 months now and have made back the full amount I put in. It really does pay ~1% a day but it is a huge risk because of how anonymous the company is they could close down and run away with your money at any day, but they do pay.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:38:30
You sir are awesome.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:36:00
There are already taxes when you reintroduce your bitcoin back into USD, but if you've had it in there for over a year I believe it falls into commodities tax like gold, so you hit a lower bracket (not a tax guy so don't quote me)
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:26:02
It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:20:54
It is absolutely a possibility. I imagine they don't like all this money going outside of their perfect little bubble, but there's not really anything they can do to stop it. It would be like trying to shut down/outlaw using the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:12:31


@_date: 2017-11-29 00:26:35
It's always a possibility, but extremely unlikely. They could take a negative stance and try to keep exchanges from opening up on their soil, or even sueing companies that try to sell from oversees, but then people will just go peer to peer cash -&gt; BTC which the Gov cant stop so it's kinda beyond that point now I think.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:08:17
I'm fairly certain all your questions are answered in the initial comment, but in case you wanted specifics. July 6th 2017 was the first day I used the platform, As of today I have $1000 invested and have a total return of $1449.90. The average for the past 30 days has been 1.03% and 0.96% for the past 6 months.

If you bought your btc today, you buy that many coins, for all intensive purposes the price you bought at is locked in. If the coins you bought go up in value during the week long period the value of your investment will also go up so don't stress. Coinbase and GDAX are basically the same entity, the only reason to buy on GDAX instead is if you use a complicated method to avoid fees buying LARGE amounts of bitcoin. You're good man no need to stress, and welcome onboard to the ride of your life.

Its fine, the learning curve here can be a steep climb when you're first getting in. Yes you absolutely should keep your coins in your private wallet (the top 3 everyone on here suggests are Electrum, Mycelium, and Exodus) if you need an explanation on how to set em up I can explain it. Exchanges are great for buying or selling coins but you never want to store your money on them if you can help it.

If someone did manage to send a corrupted form of the ledger out with false transactions they would have to consistently be the one to complete the block in order to keep that lie going, as soon as someone else beat them to it it would broadcast the true block history and make their transaction incorrect as it should have been. I believe I heard in an interview somewhere to fraudlize one bitcoin it would take ~32Billion dollars. Does't make sense to do that since you'd make better returns actually robbing a bank.

But that's not what it's about for me, It's literally safer to keep my value in crypto, and it might take me an extra day if I ever needed to take it out in an emergency so it was a no brainer. The fact it has also tripled my savings is just a bonus.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:37:01
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:22:48
Yes it has, put my entire savings into crypto ~$3000 mark because it wasn't doing anything in the bank. Every day I toss around the idea to sell back my initial and let the rest ride, but that amount keeps being worth more every day I let it sit in so now I just let it do it's thing and I try not to stress about it anymore.

I can explain it to you if you'd like to PM me, but the $10 offer was for the other person, since network congestion was insanely high at the point of this post, it wasn't feasible to get the $10 from anywhere besides a miner.

It allows you to point where you want to mine.
