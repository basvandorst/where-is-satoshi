It will never crash back down to 0 cause a lot of people with a lot of money are eye the shit out of it. Even if it did fall, I doubt it would fall down more than 50%, a lot of people are waiting on it to go down to buy more to sell at a higher price afterward,
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:04:12
Ya, we hadn't dipped enough for the yearly correction. This is good, it'll get pumped back up again.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:51:48
nope bro, at this point, with so many people waiting on the dip. It will go up a lot more before you see a 50% dip, and by that time, I'm pretty sure the dip won't go lower than 15-20 K

I'd like to offer an alternative.
If it does stabilize, it could be used in a dual currency system, as well as bank.
You store your money in bitcoin, you exchange what you need to pay for what you want in w/e dominion X country is using, effectively tying up the whole world together, making travel easier.
Or, as dual currency system to other crypto.
But I agree that it is still pretty early to tell anything out of it yet. Give it a year on the mainstream, see if it survive that without failing hard and we'll be talking.

Buy some more once it stabilize at the bottom, you will be able to cover your losses.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:44:15
This is the result of the future trading, It's pretty normal.
You dont want it to get to 20k too fast or it'll go down just as quickly. 
Here's how a whale operate with a bot : Put huge sell wall at 20k, price dip to 18k, buy back what you sold at 20k, profit.

With the current fees you might wanna wait but the normal strategy to invest in a growing unstable market is to invest w/e you want (i suggest less than half of your saving) periodically, that way you balance out the losses, look up Dollar-cost-averaging.

It true that inflation is accepted to be necessary by today's standard. But in fact, It's not. 
Inflation feed our current over consumption in our degraded capitalist society. 
If we look at the history, when we used non-inflationary currency, we mostly did small exchange with food : perishable good.
As you say, if you can buy two sandwich next week with today price for one sandwich, it is not viable, but there's solution. 
For starters, the more expensive the BTC, the more stable it is on the low end.
Second is the pure capitalism aspect of it, competition : Let,s hypothetically say the value keep doubling each week, or to keep it simple, just say it keep increasing and we know this for sure. This would create competition that would take that increase into account, so that the coffee you'd be paying would be MUCH MUCH cheaper, simply because the merchant know his money will keep growing : He buy bean for 1 btc, and he sell all the coffee for 1 BTC too, but the second BTC has more buying power than the first one, simply because time has passed. So he can buy more bean for that same BTC or take that growth into account and make his coffee cheaper, so he can sell more.
All in all, I agree that neither system can work atm, in fact, it Can't be used as currency as long as the price doesn't stabilize. Unfortunately, The BTC is quite similar to currency in the medieval age, since it is purely based on demand and supply, there's bound to be places where BTC is worth more than other. Right now this is happening with Korea

Or the volume goes infinetly down with 0.000001 BTC worth hundreds of dollar (hyperbole). 
This breaks dollar. I don't know much about eco but i'm pretty scared.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:29:34
Check the month chart. The bubble went and gone. 
Now look at the year chart. Now look at it correctly with log on. cause there's growth.
Now correction happen frequently, but that'S healthy, you'd rather have 10 small correction than a big one. (A huge correction could indeed crash the whole thing, cept most of the volume is in HODL'ers who've been through hell and back already.)

Except that'S not stock, nor money, nor any amount, its % of users. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:54:36
Well, shit my bank offer 4% annual on 10k+. Under that and you get 2-3% which is NOTHING counting in the inflation rate (2%).
Bitcoin it is.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:11:29
XMR (monero) and Zcash are both anonymous, Bitcoin has a public record.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:51:22
That's the two option at this point : will people who cashed out at the top buy more lower and make it rise even further, or will  correct it self, loose attention and slow down.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:33:52
This article points out that the reason the bank don't like bitcoin is the reason people are buying it...
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:24:10
Look up dollar cost averaging, imo its the best way to invest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:54:04
He's referring to the math behind bitcoin : It cannot be copied, stolen, duplicated, or controlled.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:03:31
..... Just think about those billion getting paid.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:46:19
I was just stating that we live in a capitalist society, which I qualify as degraded since the society value the dollar more than I think it should. 
I didn't say a word about communism, If I had to qualify bitcoin, it's pure capitalism. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:31:13
Because of the fixed amount of bitcoin, it will gain value vs those other crypto that dont have fixed amount. 
Its like the stories about the dude who bought the last 3 of a kind stamp for 2 million each, burned 2 and sold the last one for 10 million.
Also, Fiat Money (US dollar,etc) is no longer backed up by gold, AKA it is also worthless and the only thing that give it value is the willingness of ppl who attribute it value. Its ALL about the offer and the demand, cept it is carefully managed by the government and bank print more to keep the value stable. 
Bitcoin offer the exact same thing, without inflation, is has the value of the demand.
I do agree with you : right now it's only purpose is to sell for cash. It wont and cannot be used untill it stabilize, which may never happen. That's where the other crypto try to come in, to offer that stability somehow.

We are, hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:19:04
Nope they recently renamed but it didint take off, Kinda like snoop lion.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:04:23
I did specify BTC tho.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:15:16
Exactly my train of though, while it would help the &lt;I dont need to buy a whole bitcoin?&gt; mentality, it would certainly drive the price up like craaazy and thats a correction waiting to happen, now if all those people come rushing in thinking, this thing they bought for 17 buck is now 20, they'll rush even more, -&gt; more micro transaction - &gt; more fees -&gt;less enthusiasm -&gt; massive correction -&gt; people are turned off for good.
I think any renaming should happen after the transfer fees are resolved.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:32:48
Cept this is not a dip, Check the market cap, 40 Billion already left, Its a crash, buy back in 12 hour for more bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:16:28
Your first point is a pretty stupid statement, I mean, why would you care if someone was buying nuclear weapon, it's his money right ?
Your second point totally miss out the point of OP which is that Roger Ver is an hypocritical asshole
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:36:02
normal fees = 1 to 4 dollar, they're going at 40 ish atm, youll have to wait unfortunatly
