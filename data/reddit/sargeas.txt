Lmao I came here to post that it might go sub 9k, we might need the Vegeta memes back for when it crosses back over.

If it's going down that much, shouldn't we all sell and then buy again at the dip?
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:38:03
I'd trade a time machine for a Subaru any day. Good cars!
@_date: 2019-07-01 04:57:31
Or $15 per hour starting 2020.

Yeah! Tell him to get lost with his sound reasoning. Only room here for wild speculation and guesses out of our asses!
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:27:45
And they sold out :(
@_date: 2019-07-31 03:37:09
Very well said. I'm saving this to quote you, you God dammed beautiful poet.

This is the first time I see any mention of HODL wallet. I use it, I think it's great!
@_date: 2019-08-02 11:05:41
85 what per cent?! I need to know!
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:57:12
That's awesome! I talk to people about Bitcoin, no one cares :(
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:51:31
Since no one answered, it means "hold on, don't letgo" or hold on to dear life" it's part of Bitcoin culture now to HODL.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:22:39
Coinbase pro charges .25%
@_date: 2019-08-04 07:07:49
Yeah I think it's just .25% per transaction. Pro is free. Just Google coinbase pro and it takes you to their pro site. Same login as regular coinbase... Just cheaper lol
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:09:05
I SHALL HODL!!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:23:48
I'm really glad u asked. I had been seeing it around this sub, didn't know what it meant. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:21:55
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:17:02
We all nervous about buying, but end up regretting we didn't buy, or regretting we didn't buy more lol.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:55:09
I'll contribute!
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:40:38
You did everything right.
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:21:45
We snapped it!!!
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:46:52
It looks like it's 40 cents a gallon, not .4 cents. Additional 20 cents with car wash.
@_date: 2019-08-20 02:29:47
It's unlikely to moon in the next six months. We got more than that before the halving next year.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:56:37
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:07:44
I'm ordering mine right now!
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:38:17
A minute after this post, it hit 8500!!
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:36:03
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:16:32
What's HODL!?!?
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:19:57
It cracked 9000 for a second!!!!
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:42:27
I wish I just got sad. I shit enough chickens to sell eggs
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:34:13
We all just had an orgy together from our respective houses
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:33:48
Do we still buy at this point?
