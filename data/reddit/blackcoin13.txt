Nice! Please make sure to get this into Canada as you suggested. Good luck to you.

BitCoin is old tech that's enjoying its honeymoon phase. I'd rather not 'convert' my BlackCoins into BTC using shapeshift.

Yes, I agree. I've been reading quite a bit about nubits and I really think they are on to something. With the price volatility of btc, nbt is a great way to 'park' your money. Exco.in has nubit trading pairs which I've used. I think it's great that 1NBT is = to 1USD. No more guessing involved.

Interesting.. this is definitely a positive sign. Kudos to Taiwan for taking a lead so early in the game.

OP: "and we will start to see the true 'second phase' of crypto in the coming months"
I agree. This is still the very early stages of crypto and the next few years will be quite interesting to watch unfold.

Very informative post. Good job.

It's unfortunate what is happening with Bitcoin. The get-rich-quick 'investors' are baling. They created the hype and pump. On a positive note, this will level the playing field and allow innovations such as Proof of Stake V3, which is about to be released, to get the attention it deserves. It's not important that Bitcoin succeeds but that cryptocurrency as a whole succeeds, in one way, shape or form.

The video after was much more entertaining. :) I miss the 90's. If I could only go back in time..

You really should accept BlackCoin as well.

There are a lot of people that aren't so sure that Proof of Work is the way to go to secure a coin. It uses an incredible amount of energy and unfortunately the mining process has become centralized.
There are several legitimate coins currently experimenting with different types of 'proofs' - and this can only be a good thing for cryptocurrency as a whole.

Is it safer to use Authy/GA than having a text msg code sent to my phone?
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:45:44
Nice. Looking forward to trying this out. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 02:57:31
Cheaper? You mean the 1.6TWh in electricity per year Bitcoin uses to secure it's network? That's equivalent to 2.1 Billion Horsepower!

First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you..

I tried that once. Took a bit less than two days but hey, I'm an impatient guy. :|  $2 for Interac would be acceptable imo. I'd probably buy more regularly. Guess I can't have it all.

Not sure if you've heard of NightTrader ( but once true decentralized exchanges go mainstream we won't need to go through these middlemen exchanges.

Two Words: BitHalo, BlackHalo  - smart contracts that use either Bitcoin or Blackcoin
@_date: 2015-03-03 21:13:43
It's a bit pricey at $5 for Interac deposit, esp if you buy regularly. Vos was $1.50 iirc.

I did do it with one trusted seller. I've had a few successful trades and am verified. I then went to buy from another seller, he wanted me to do it again for him.

It wasn't difficult. Just had to have the address of your bank, transit number and your chequing or savings acct number. My bank charged me 1 dollar for the EFT.
@_date: 2015-03-04 03:42:11
Absolutely not. Decentralized exchanges are just around the corner ( Patience is a virtue, mind you, and mine is growing thin. Just release the damned thing David so we can rid ourselves of these 3rd parties.

I find Localbitcoins to be overpriced. I understand the security concerns of some of the sellers but having to take a photo of yourself holding up your drivers license is just awkward.
