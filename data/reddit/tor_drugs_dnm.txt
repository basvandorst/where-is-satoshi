wow, that's actually a great way to think about it. Gonna put a few hundred in now. To diversify, I think I'll also put a few hundred into monero as well; tbh the privacy aspect of monero makes it seem like a better solution, but at the same time, bitcoin is much easier to use

makes sense, thanks for the idea!!

thanks for linking that. I've decided I will definitely buy some :)

alright, thanks for the info! I'm not expecting insane returns on a few hundred obviously, but hate seeing my money stagnate in a bank..

what do you mean by weekly?

Yea I have, but I just use bitcoins to buy my medicine (weed and lsd, which aren't legal in my state, but fucking should be)
I haven't bought them as sort of an investment, but thinking I'll do that now.
Not an advertisement for monero at all.. in fact, don't even have a monero wallet yet, but seeing as the price is quite low on monero + privacy makes it seem more viable (to me at least; like most regular ppl don't want others to know how much they own, make etc).
honestly not an ad though, not sure what I would be hoping to achieve if it was..

good point, guess I'm not sure where I should ask and plus I did get some helpful comments here

Why is that question silly? Just because I think monero might be better for privacy doesn't mean it's a better investment.. that's why I'm asking whether or not btc is still a good investment..
why are you so mad? I didn't even mention monero in the OP. I have 0 idea what makes you think I'm somehow trying to advertise for monero and how that would benefit me (there's literally 0 ways I could profit by making this thread..). I'm asking for investment advice... god dude
