There was a crash?
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:28:35
I don't even care about bitcoin, but this needs to be seen by everyone.
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:29:19
Wish I could remember/recover my Blockchain password. I'd sell too.
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:42:17
My bad. I didn't mean it to sound so abrasive. Now will get downvoted to hell lol. I'll just check out the site and figure it out.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:07:12
I don't get it.
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:21:53
Wouldn't you try to get your coins back? I mean, wtf. What would you idiots do??
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:03:49
Uhhhh. I thought that was a bad thing. Judging by the down voting it looks like they're doing the right thing? Well fuck you guys, it's BS that they don't try to give me my password. Thats a lot of money just gone.

i have a bunch of coins in my blockchain wallet and then forgot my password. These bastards wouldnt give my password. I say fug em.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:52:59
WTF is TigerDirect...
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:57:07
GIVE THEM HELL.
@_date: 2014-02-13 00:24:16
lol and then he said "cheap."
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:58:14
Yo, block chain bitcoin people. If I have money in a block chain wallet, and I've forgotten the password, how screwed am I? Do they do password recovery?
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:26:55
Side note: I have money in a blockchain account and forgot my password.
Worst website ever. If they have that information on there, I sure as hell couldn't find it.
@_date: 2014-07-08 04:15:17
Yeah, but, like, doesn't anyone here get this shaky, not-chill feeling about this whole bitcoin thing? I can't help but think about the one world government - one world economy thing, or the biblical negative stuff.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:15:51
Oh. Nice.
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:36:34
They'll join you, help improve the system, help improve the infrastructure, then they'll corrupt it and use it as a pawn in their corrupt, greedy schemes. I guarantee it.

Banks weren’t directly responsible for creating the Great Depression. The banks were used as a tool. Read up.

4chan is the most fascinating shit in the world, I swear.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:14:06
So you're proving this point with a video that is actually just a picture?
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:32:49
HOLD UP. When the hell did this become a thing? Kind of seems impractical at this point. Someone take me to school.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:30:19
I know what that means!...
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:53:05
Sweet looking website. No "About Us" page. So I can use this to tip people, and in doing so I explain to them what it is?
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:53:55
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:26:07
I have to put WAY too much effort into finding any products on your site. I never found any, by the way.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:11:16
Nice. Sadly, in LA, you have the choice of pretty much spending them in a french restaurant or a body sculpting spa. Which is pretty amazing when you think about it.

@_date: 2013-11-13 00:53:31
How do you use bitcoinaverage, though. I want desparately to udnerstand all the numbers. It'd be cool to buy some bitcoins soon.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:10:56
lol You're so bored with your day that you're putting energy and effort into complaining about other people complaining on the Internet. Think about that for a second.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:31:33
It's also good, and in everyone's interest to have a true, working marketplace of ideas. I mean, this is true in any decent society, as well. Although obviously not seen in any capacity on Reddit, I think there is value in not just downvoting the shit out of anyone with an idea or comment that deviates from the norm, but letting it stay and welcoming a discussion.

WTF is a Bitcoin Black Friday?
