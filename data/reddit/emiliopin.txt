Yes, though I hold 50% of my assets in BTC. I think it’s smart to read what’s happening in both sides. I still honk BTC will be the king at least in the next few years. But just remember what happened to yahoo or msn

Oh, why isn't BTC community agreeing to speed that up? Like an update, not a fork. I can see a lot of people complaning here about this, but the problem still remains after a few months. Something like this months fork (the cancelled one), but made by the community, not by 5 guys..

By my location I won’t get it on time as I can see. Is there any full wallet you can advise me to use? (I have seen options but I would like to see if there’s any you have used).
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:36:35
Yes.  I have been waiting for about 10 hours and my transaction still not confirmed:

In Mexico, yes. I have just transfered some money from my bank to an exchange to buy some BTC... it took about... 1 min? The Mexican Central bank is making a huge effort for banks to have 24/7 transactions. Where are you from?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:43:43
It's kind of crazy right know, even other alts
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:43:13
Thanks! I have just heard some people having problems transfering all kind of cryptos today... and a lot of wallets and excanges are under maintenance today... Maybe there where overwhelmed by the high volume today?
Thanks Russian

I did some 3 o 4 BTC transactions 3 days ago, and I think that I paid more than 50 USD for all of them together... Unfortunately, those were necessary transtactions. My Mexican bank transfer fee is 0..., even between different banks at takes just a few seconds to transfer. Those transactions I made... the fastest took about 4 hours and the longest, more than one day.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:37:43
And the fee for doing that is 0, while BTC is..., well, you know..., its more expensive by the day...

Thanks once again! Really appreciate your time and words. Good luck to all of us!

If I have and Exodus wallet should I leave them there? Why is there people telling to export the keys, if I have that wallet I thougt I really own the keys (compared to have them in an exchange). And if it does split... Will I get the new coins if I have them in my wallet or shoud I also export the keys? I'm confused, sorry, I hope you can answer me those questions and read your opinion.

I advice you to read the book "the art of war", by 孫子. It is not copyrighted, so you can download free versions everywhere, even in amazon kindle.

I will buy one next year. Just wondering, what happens if the hardware malfunctions or if there’s a fire or it gets stolen!  Can I recover my cryptos?

Maybe DASH will be the king, who knows. I’m not an expert, unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:48:24
Do you feel threatened?

Ian, I have been holding crypto since April, but I have just started reading a lot about them from the past 3 weeks. Regarding my BTC, which is not much, I think your idea of holding them in Coinbase is the best option. I would like to ask something, when the new coin is created, will the network be so unstable that I (we) shouldn’t sell them immediately? Or is the network problem exclusive of the current BTC after the fork?

Thanks for sharing
