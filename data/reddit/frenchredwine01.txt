Taking some profit is always good. Gives you peace of mind, even you leave some money on the table. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:41:39
Wrong. If you *can* take it out, it's yours. Maybe it's yours the moment you sold it, even if your acct takes time to get credited. Leave it in the bank all you want, IRS will love to add fees and penalties. 
Bottom line: for small amount you probably owe nothing, but pay an accountant for bigger sales. They know it better
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:44:01
yeah but by knowing that you have $17 million in 
Panama they get to ask you how you made it and all 
the other fun questions. Probably broke dozens of laws ;)

Let's see: so someone bought at $500 and sold at $12000 (albeit mistakenly *this time*) hoping to have some money just in case...is pathetic? What if a new crypto becomes "Bitcoin" and this one goes to $1? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:04:02
Probably those rich from Bitcoin are seen as fairer target, "he made his money easily." Nevertheless, you do not want to be in Russia, Ukraine
and the likes. If the thugs don't kidnap you and ransom, the bureaucrats will. This means that anytime they want, 
you will be subject to shakedowns...or Siberia awaits you.

for sellers, probably 99% of the people out there, losing that hard drive and finding it 2017 would have super ideal. You get Bitcoin for essentially nothing, and you realize that you can pay your house or college tuition when it reached $xxx. It's very hard to resist.

21 Million coins. Satoshi supposedly has close to 1 million of them, or at least lots of them. God knows how many are lost forever and then we have people with tens of thousands and even more coins. 
"People" own jack, so obviously those with a lot more skin in the game will take over, sorta one bitcoin, one vote.

so what? You cash out at least enough to live decently (early adopters) and keep the rest. 60 Bitcoins at the top were worth more than $1 MILLION, in cash. That first million for essentially doing nothing, is a lot more rewarding and calming than (MAYBE) having a few more million 3 years from now--with the downside of losing it all. 
To each his own and if they had sold they'd have nothing, but if I had thousands of bitcoins I would have sold at $15k enough to have FU money. You can withdraw 3%-4% for life. That's priceless, and you owe it to your family, as money helps your kids do much better in life. If you had $30mil worth of bitcoin and 3 years from now people move to a different coin, you might have a heart attack. At least, stress will take a few years from your life.

That may be because of having no capital gain taxes.

Who's "we" ? How's the weather down there in Zimbabwe :)?

Not sure what will happen xx years from now, but from 7 cents to almost $20,000 is one hell of the ride. Nuf said. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:07:59
Yp! I wouldn't trust that computer. 
and I def would not use my real name while mentioning that I have bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:47:28
Yeah but birds make new eggs quite often. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:22:50
don't forget that many newbies for FOMO bought it at almost $20k a coin. This is despair for them
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:28:54
They will beat you to 0.1mm near death. Throw a bucket of cold water and try it again 2 hours later. Didn't the SS and DEA agents steal from Pirate Bay stash? Now imagine what police do in third world country

Can't pick and choose his words. Wanna tell us what he said about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:41:51
so sell your house and jump in. Then let us know what happened
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:44:34
You are not buying a stock or a house that has something backing it. Bitcoin goes up if people buy it. Value is from zero to infinity. Go ahead and buy it at $8000 if you want. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:32:59
HODL mah beer, I need to check my email. Oh s^%$t my 100k bitcoins are gone...forgot the self-destruction thing
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:42:04
call me crazy but I have a feeling that he does it already, 
no need for prices to go to a certain level. He's, let's say,weird.
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:29:33
see this for what it is...a great marketing campaign for a law firm. 
In 99% of cases there's no money to be divided. Maybe a house, mortgaged and all. Divorce really f-s everyone over, until they find another partner. All expenses double, yet salary stays the same
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:32:16
Sergey Medvedev and the rest should NEVER leave Russia. Share their loot with a Pooty Poot crony and live like a king. No extradition. 
Somewhat cold but I'm sure he can find a warmer place in Russia than in a US prison.

Define dead...even if it goes to $3 a coin it will still be "alive"
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:04:06
not if you need the eggs to pay rent and eat. How many eggs are left after expenses? Most people get one chance in life--if they're lucky.
