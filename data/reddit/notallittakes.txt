Yo dawg...
Honestly, if block-ception seriously becomes the official solution, I'm done. Bitcoin will literally be a joke at that point.

Just to be clear, by re-defining the problem to "what the block size could be in the case of deliberate attack", you're acknowledging that was wrong to call it "the block size".
In any case, that attack wouldn't work very well. An intentionally-inflated block has a high orphan risk (very high if soft limits like in Bitcoin Unlimited catch on...), unless you have 51% hashpower. Repeatedly 51%-attacking the network is an excellent way to reduce the value of bitcoin and throw away your profits.
Not being a dick is still economically sensible for miners whether there's a hard cap on the block size or not. If you still think miners are going to screw everyone over even if it costs them in the long run, then maybe you should just quit bitcoin now.

Even assuming it's a good rule "overwhelming consensus" is not adequately defined. So, the mods can pick any proposal they don't like, declare that it doesn't have enough consensus, and then remove it.
@_date: 2015-12-31 03:00:06


No. Consensus literally means "general agreement". Unanimity literally means "complete agreement". This not up for debate.
If you don't like either of those meanings, find or invent new words. Those are taken.

Pretty much this. The attack seems to rely on "trick the user into creating and sending a new transaction with different coins". A client with automatic retries and random server hopping could defeat this attack unless *all* nodes are compromised.

I'd say "shouldn't be".

Good thing I got my BTC out a week before the halt.

But a user sitting on twitter all day replying to bitcoin questions functionally *is* a keyword scanning robot.
Is it a problem of volume, that a bot replies *too much*? That can be fixed by rate limiting. Or, is it just somehow wrong that it's electronic and not biological in origin?
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:26:04
Voted back up. As someone who wants bitcoin to succeed, this whole post is depressing.

Encrypt the shit out of it and store the keys and copies of the data in separate places.
Test decrypting it before destroying unencrypted copies.

You could have the parameters change constantly based on recent block hashes. Done right, the best ASICs wouldn't be able to beat GPUs by much. So, nobody would bother producing any.

75% of mining power is not going to go behind a chain-fork that doesn't have economic majority support, or they would destroy their own business. Just like Coinbase selling coins on a non-dominant chain, it won't happen.
If you don't think that major players in bitcoin are rational actors, then you should probably give up now and go back to centralized currency.
@_date: 2016-01-09 23:39:06
The answer is very simply "yes". The blockchain (not the software!) recognized by an economic majority as "bitcoin" is "bitcoin".
@_date: 2016-01-10 02:40:23


The "free market" has a solution to that problem: switch to another blockchain. It doesn't *have* to be the original satoshi chain that succeeds.


If nobody can design a cryptocurrency that actually works then so be it. You can't force anyone to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-11 12:07:21


Forgive my ignorance: is there a simple formula to determine the probability that a particular transaction will be mined in (say) the next hour? If there is, then it would be fairly easy for anyone usually accepting 0-conf fall back to 1-conf if the fee the customer chose was too low. Wallets should be sending higher fees than this by default, so in practice 0-conf should be relatively low-risk if implemented well.
In that case, full RBF dramatically boosts the probability of a successful attack, while opt-in RBF would not.
Of course, if wallets start sending RBF-enabled transactions by default, then 0-conf-acceptors have to choose to either deny 0-conf to most of their customers (and instruct them to disable that RBF thing they probably don't understand next time) *or* accept the risk (which is now higher, since the fee-threshold trick doesn't work).
Hence it is still correct to say that any form other than FSS-RBF being widely used significantly alters (at the very least complicates) the risk calculation of accepting 0-conf.


...And statements like *that* are missing the point at best.
@_date: 2015-11-30 13:46:39
That isn't an argument. That's literally just "no, you're ignorant, stfu". 0/10, my cat could have done better.
Sorry, but I'm going to use this discussion thread to discuss the fucking topic. Unsub if you're not okay with that.
@_date: 2015-11-30 12:07:01




You know that it requires 75% hashpower to activate, right?
*You* might have a magic super holy definition of consensus beamed down from the great crypto heavens by shibetoshi himself. Just because other people don't share a ridiculously specific belief does not mean that they are "not seeking consensus".


You know what sacrifices the essence of bitcoin? Crippling it as a payment system to force people onto sidechains - intentionally or otherwise.
@_date: 2015-11-30 21:24:22
You're *still* missing the core point. You're seeing what you wanted to see - you *want* political opponents with oddly similar views (down to exact beliefs about visa scalability) but which are completely opposite and thus dismissible as ignorant. I'm not sure it's worth explaining it to you after you've tried so so hard not to see it, but here goes.


I didn't actually give my personal preference for how bitcoin/other crypto payments should work. Re-read what I said. I just implied that keeping the block size cap was "crippling" it (which you haven't argued against, in fact you seem to agree), thus "forcing" an off-chain solution. That part - the part where people are *forced* to use not-bitcoin instead of bitcoin - THAT is against "the essence of bitcoin".
There's a gulf between "users switch to side chains because it actually provides a better service" and "users switch to side chains because they can't get transactions through anymore without paying excessively".
And now the lesser points:


Why does 'everything' == 'visa'? Why is visa the sole reference point? What's wrong with (say) rivaling paypal?
*You* might be obsessed with replacing visa, but that doesn't mean that everyone else is as well, such that they imagine whichever solution they support as a visa-replacement.
You have no idea how frustrating this is. It's like if I said "well, pepsi isn't that great..." and you reply "WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED WITH COKE?!?!" Dismissal of one thing does not imply support for the opposite extreme.


I don't know if this is the optimal outcome, but it *is* the original vision of bitcoin.
Said vision doesn't get redefined every time someone finds a limitation with bitcoin.
Sidechains specifically represent a departure from bitcoin. I don't know if that's good or bad, but I won't let people get away with pretending that things-that-are-not-bitcoin are somehow the "true" bitcoin just because of a supposed technical advantage.
I'd be so happy if the core devs+supporters came out and said "satoshi was an idiot, bitcoin is shit! we have to put a stop to on-block payments because they don't work. Here, try this sidechain..." because at least it would be fucking honest.
@_date: 2015-11-30 14:23:48
Visa? When did I mention visa? When did I claim bitcoin could scale to a particular arbitrary level?
How can you say I don't know what I'm talking about when YOU'RE NOT EVEN READING WHAT I'M SAYING?!
Did you...did you seriously pick out "payment system" and extrapolate that into a whole series of extremely specific beliefs about scalability?
I think you've actually unlocked the level *above* "missing the point". This is not an achievement of which you should be proud. Seek help.

So, he got into CES with shitty fake badges solely for the purpose of shouting at BFL for their "fucking box of fans", and putting it on video, even though it was already on video?
@_date: 2013-01-15 09:55:54


Explain. If I try to be really nice, the best wording I can find is this:
* He wanted to inform the community that they didn't bring working ASIC hardware to CES.
The problem with this, is that it was already known weeks in advance that they wouldn't. He must surely have known this, so why would he post something like this? A misleading attack on BFL's reputation, or a desperate cry for attention?
@_date: 2013-01-12 01:17:22


Micon ran around being a troll. They said long before CES that their demo would not actually be functional. All the "hard questions" have been done to death on the forums. They have, to date, honored every refund request. They have shipped very real FPGA products. They know that they have more to gain from actually selling ASICs continuously than a one-off scam.


No, it's isomorphic to a situation where their first and possibly second batch of chips failed. Adjusting a design and getting new chips made takes months, but saying "we fucked up the chips" is embarrassing so pretty much no company actually admits to it.

@_date: 2013-01-15 23:43:14
You may not realise this, but the video is his *second* encounter with BFL. He admits that he was there before. Why would he go to BFL *twice*? Why not just go once with a camera?  Why doesn't he deny shouting about the box with fans the first time? Why did Josh *only* get angry at him? Almost everyone there would have asked about the box and the products, but nobody else has reported an angry reaction. If you look at how he reacts, it's *exactly* how you expect someone to react to a troll coming back for more.
I simply cannot agree that he was somehow acting in good faith here.
@_date: 2013-03-10 12:30:03
I checked the thread, the questions *were* dumb. And written in caps.
Also, others reported receiving their refunds without issue.
@_date: 2013-01-12 01:27:36


Where did they say they would bring working ASIC hardware? Oh wait, they said they wouldn't.


The last person who told me they were a "skeptic" said that global warming can't be real because the earth is only 6000 years old, so forgive me for being skeptical as to you being an actual skeptic. You come across as more of a troll than anything; it's not surprising that the representative would get angry if a troll came and shouted/swore at him and later came back for more.
If you're truly a skeptic, then you should be able to explain why it's more likely that it's a pre-order scam than a product being delayed due to failed ASICs. Considering the rate of failed ASIC designs for a startup, you'll need a much bigger pile of evidence to show that a scam is more probable.

The only problem would be if it took a really long time before the difficulty change. With any luck the mining would ramp down rather than just stop entirely.

He got into CES with shitty fake badges solely for the purpose of shouting at BFL for their "fucking box of fans". That's pretty running-around-trolling worthy, unless you want to pick at semantics about him walking etc.
