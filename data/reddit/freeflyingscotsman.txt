No. That's retarded.

There is &gt;200k BTC moving around mtgox wallets with their transactions being publicly reported via the API. We know Mark hasn't bought those coins, ergo they've regained access to some funds. Wait and see. We do not have the full picture here yet.

It's not the biggest transaction in history though? Gox moved 424242.42424242 and later 500k I think.

Early 2011, and I got shown it by my uni flatmate, he was all interested in crypto and I had way better GPUs than him :P

There was quite a cool one somebody made as a proof of concept on the bitcoin forums a while back - they actually gave back the coins they ended up being sent.
Basically all it did was look for valid bitcoin addresses being copy+pasted and changed them to an address controlled by the attacker. Enough people didn't double-check the address that they were sent quite a lot of coin.

I know, right, it has dual 6970s in it and everything...

Bankruptcy protection isn't quite the same in Japan, at least that's my understanding.

There is blockchain evidence that at least a substantial part of Karpeles/Gox's funds haven't moved from their cold storage (I cba getting the link just now but it relates to BTC moved around in the 424242.42424242 transaction in 2011).
Much more likely is that the massive and ongoing investigation into gox in relation to international money laundering/conspiracy/whatever else charges tied to SR has caused them not to be allowed access to their cold storage and gagged.

You have out-early-adoptered me sir, congratulations.
I actually bought my last desktop PC for bitcoin. 2100BTC. I have some buyer's remorse, not gonna lie.

Gox has a US subsiduary. When the US gov seized funds (~$5m I think) off gox last year they went through that:

I'm sure there are plenty of people here who've been around long enough to remember the pirateat40 debacle. That too was a significant percentage of all the coins in the network at the time.

Not in relation to an ongoing investigation they can't.

I would have thought it was entirely obvious?
MtGox has been under investigation for the better part of a year in relation to the Silk Road. This was a very big investigation, phrases like "funnelling money into Silk Road", "Funding Terrorism" and "Child Pornography" keep popping up. They've already moved on Bitinstant and others.
Mark has been dropping hints for weeks now that he can't talk about issues they're having due to a US government investigation. He claims his own losses are just "currently unavailable".
The man is under a gag order.
He could not make it any more obvious without tattooing it on his own face.

I remember when my PC used to mine 6BTC per day... good times, goooood times.
