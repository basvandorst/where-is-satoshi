A lot of what they do relies on having other people's money as liquidity to compensate transactions at a large scale which you. Ouldnt do with physical dollars. 
If they don't have that liquidity they lose a lot of their capital to continually be profitable. Personal loans could be easily established for individuals, peer to peer. 
Sure they won't go away,but they will not be making as much money as before a widespread adoption. It's a ways off, but it's certainly a valid reason to worry fr them

You should check out the bitcoin white paper that was posted here a few days ago, that led me to a lot of clarity. It's an older document but it's very simply explained. 
As for combating comments like "I'm not taking advice from my 12 year old..." you might remind him that people who are familiar, and comfortable with technology are the future, and "just not understanding it," isn't a good reason to not learn more about it. 
You're young and already into this stuff, so it won't be the last time you have interest in a growing technology or resource that's not proved itself yet. A level headed response that doesn't avoid "I don't know," or "I can find that out," is going to be a valuable skill for you. 
Good luck man, stay curious.

I know very little about Litecoin, so I'm just curious, what makes it less secure?

It sounds like you've done your fair share of mulling around, good on you. I'm just getting into it as well, I would say a good way to get yourself into it might be to "ask" to learn about it with your parents or something. I just had a long talk with my Dad about it and it was pretty interesting to hear his perspective. He was skeptical, like I expected him to be - but I had some good info to give to him up front to staunch his immediate skeptisim and spark a little interest. 
Seems like from the side of things - it might get you an in to it sooner rather than later. Since at this point every week you don't invest is another profitable reason why you should. I wish I would have shared my interest in stuff like this to my parents when I was 16, but I didn't over come that "they probably won't care" feeling.
