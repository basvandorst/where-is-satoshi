 This is a good read on that subject.

I've been thinking about getting a hardware wallet for a while, but I want one that I can import my paper wallet data. 
AFAIK, none of the hardware wallets on the market at the moment allow this.  I'm sure its a feature that is in demand, anyone know of any planned developments in this?

I like ATMs, I use the local one whenever I pass it and have some spare cash.  No particular concerns over the exchange rate, the price goes up and down all the time anyway &lt;shrug&gt;.  I'm no speculator, I just want some btc, and a no-id cash exchange fits my purposes perfectly.

Ever read Podolinsky?  I think you might like him.  He expands on Marx's Labour Theory of Value to an "Energy theory of value" - it works very well with btc, where energy is transformed into money.  
 I dont know of an English translation, but Google translate makes this one quite readable.

I think it crosses a variety of political leanings, most (all?) of which would be considered left wing.
From what i can see it declares itself anarcho-syndicalist (but I actually wouldnt agree that was a very good fit).  I see it more in the tradition of insurrectionary anarchist, or even egoist communism.

No, I dont think it does.  I see bitcoin as more of a "settlement layer" - the standard of value.  
So as long as other coins are valued against btc, and those coins are used, bitcoin will increase in value with their use.  I suspect in the longer term, btc will only be directly transacted for major purchases (house, luxury goods, land), other circulating btc will be in lightening channels.

1. Left wing. In btc as in everything else
2. Bitcoin isnt the solution, but its a step on the way to fully automated luxury communism, which is the ultimate goal
3. Too many people who are into bitcoin see it as a get rich quick scheme/speculators toy/investment device
4. This is a good site [

See, here is the fallacy.   You dont need to buy food - deflationary economy or no deflationary economy.  
You need food.  Buying food is one way to obtain the food that you need, but there are a range of others - growing it yourself, being gifted it, stealing it, foraging for food, collective farming....and I'm sure there are a whole lot more that I cant think of off the top of my head.  You dont need a car (although you may need transport), you dont need an apartment (although you need shelter),   
Bitcoin is a revolution, mate.  Its a whole new way of thinking about the world and our relationship to it.

I take it you have given her a copy of the private key/seed words for her money.  
I totally respect you not wanting to sell btc for fiat, but she may not be of the same opinion and she needs access to the private key in case she decides to sell.

It could give a legal basis for banning people/companies from running a full node and/or mining.

Can I ask why you decided to go through Kickstarter rather than SingularDTV?   
SDTV seems designed for this kind of fundraising and distribution, and I would have thought that crypto based projects would gravitate towards platforms in the crypto space.

The man is scum, utter scum.    
I cannot believe people are actually defending him on this forum....who knew there were so many knuckle-draggers in here.

I looked into this last summer and got as far as scoping and developing a business plan.  
What really put me off it tho was the uncertainty around the legal and tax implications (I'm in the UK) and if I would be subject to money laundering regulations.  I couldnt get a very clear answer on this from anyone at all, lawyers, accountants and business advisors were all a bit clueless.
Then the price started to rocket and I *knew* that it was going to crash at some point, and didnt want to be left with the blame.
I do think these services are badly needed tho.

My understanding is that under UK law, btc is tax free to spend (other than VAT obviously), but subject to capital gains tax if you turn it back into Sterling.
The official guidence is here, but its not that clear.
@_date: 2018-11-03 20:58:58
You already have the paper wallets, yeah?  
Just do a transfer from of your own bitcoin to the wallet address.

That was an interesting read.
What occurs to me is that these bitcoin miners are purchasing lots of "real world" stuff - like land, buildings, services etc.
Presumably they would have been purchased in dollars.  Now that btc has much more recognition and acceptance, it would make sense for miners to pay in btc.  There is an opportunity there for a "real world" bureau de change, which would turn those back into dollars, but gradually it disperces btc to the local economy, once the service providers/landowners/construction workers etc become used to being paid in btc, and start looking to spend it directly rather than going back through the dollar.
Bitcoinisation is always assumed to come from a large scale state failure and fanning out to other less stable states, gradually replacing fiat, but perhaps local adoption  at the site of bitcoin mines could see a full bitcoin economy emerging in pockets internationally.

No-one seems to know.
The problem would then be if they did not declare that income to tax authorities, then you could be done for effectively aiding and abetting tax fraud.  Its not clear either at what point the money laundering regulations come in.
Setting yourself up as a business consultant when there is so little official advice available, and a lack of specialist legal/tax/accountancy advice to call on is risky.
And it is legal, tax and accountancy advice that businesses will want most of all.  Even if thats not your specialism as a bitcoin consultant, you would need to have someone that you could refer them onto.

Dunno if you still can, but coinbase used to allow you to send btc to an email address (owner of email address then had to set up a coinbase account to access the funds).

I dont actually know that much about singular DTV beyond that I've seen it used for fundraising for crypto films. 
As I understand it, you "tokenise" your project, then do a kind of ICO then the tokens are exchanged on the Sdtv exchange.  It might not be so suitable for you if the main bulk of your funding has already been raised, but perhaps worth considering for any future productions.
This is the main page for Sdtv

This is a comparison between sdtv and kickstarter

this is a "how to" (tokit is part of sdtv)

Kindof.  They also run a rather good Solidify tutorial to make your own Zombies.  My programming is rather rusty, but its very easy to follow.

In the UK, cex takes btc for 2nd hand electronics.
