Or just have a budget. Either you're in a position to save/invest or you're in a debt-paydown mode. There are 'tolerable' amounts of debt, as in non-interest CC payments for a month before you pay it off, but beyond that it's *generally* bad. 
My issue with your suggestion is you're long-term still putting all your eggs in one basket. One's investment shouldn't be an ideology (like the OP suggests for the 200th time). Perhaps one should try to "replace" money robbed from investment accounts, but there's nothing to say by the time you have the funds a better investment opportunity will come.
Treating BTC like an investment account is like trying to retire on a 401(k) by simply adding money to quality for matching contributions, a huge risk.

I'd hardly say USD is unstable. But, yes, I didn't realize that actually happened.

It really did become the of technology. I wish they would get rid of the blogspam, but people seem to be freaking out about censorship. Really, instead of they should advertise a on the sidebar in the same way vs. @_date: 2014-01-13 23:57:06
I don't know many people that get paid in multiple currencies.
You negotiate 45k/year that's what you get + bonus.
[If you negotiate ~53.2433BTC/year, what's what you get.](
I understand what you're talking about regrading Accounting, but that's sort of a different issue.

FDE kind of only stops somebody from yanking your HDD. In many cases, the data is unencrypted at some point -and/or- the cipher is floating around in memory. That's to say, it's as likely (to me) that somebody with knowledge of bitcon would be savvy enough to have a Windows exploit to compromise FDE in a **running** OS (or simply compromise the OS and wait for the wallet to be decrypted) than it is that they would find where you live and break into your safe.
I'm making conjecture, though. I'm not sure if there is a "secure" interface between [encryption] --&gt; [bitcoin app]. I'm assuming you (an dmost people) are talking about encrypting a flat file with something like TrueCrypt or using TrueCrypt FDE on a secondary drive/OS drive.
