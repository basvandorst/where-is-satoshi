You guys are being mislead by bad actors. Bitcoin.com and Roger Ver have done more for Bitcoin than any other person in the world. If you don't want to use the cash version of Bitcoin, don't. But your ad hominem, personal attacks harm Bitcoin Core, Cash, and cryptocurrency as a whole. Please stick to arguments and stop attacking people. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 08:52:39
I agree it's ridiculous, I am just trying to ask why we are still trying to honor someone who has been defamed by the leaders of BTC as not that important. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 02:39:29
tx volume down, output volume is down...there is an avg of 3.28 outputs/tx (but all txs already have 2 outputs). so "batching" has added only an extra  1.28 output per tx.  This notion of "efficient batching" is a myth, one of many you have fallen for. Fees are low, now, because usuage is low, because BTC has lost 75% market share in a year (another fact).
@_date: 2018-05-09 10:51:11
I didn't say he contributed to the software. No one ever said he did. Anyone who has been in Bitcoin for more than 3 days knows what Roger has done for Bitcoin. It is only the newcomers, influenced by propaganda, who think of Roger as anything other than a huge net positive. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 04:39:27
I didn't agree with you. I told you to put your strawman away... and you did. And then you walked away without addressing the point that Roger has done more for Bitcoin adoption than anyone else in the world which is an objective fact. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:30:14
Did you see the data i provided. Batching has added about 1.4 additional outputs per tx... Nothing significant. The fact is that tx volume is way down, there was no "spam" (all transaction matter), and if tx volume increases then fees will rise. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 02:40:48
Roger doesn't sell anything. You are very disingenuous. Roger promoted bitcoin to the public. You contributed nothing. And yes roger promoted bitcoin in part because he has skin in the game. and Roger did it because he does not want people to be slaves to governments and fiat currency. you obviously know nothing about the guy. 
audience: this guy is a disingenuous troll. please read about ver's contributions to the bitcoin community over the years, watch his interviews (they are numerous), and try bitcoin cash and bitcoin core and see for yourself which one works like bitcoin pre-2016. 
done talk to you, troll

I have been using, not hodling but using, bitcoin since 2013. Unfortunately, BTC is no longer useful as money. But there is a version that is useful as money though, fees are 1 satoshi/byte ...less than a penny.
BTC was destroyed by humans, the tech is fine and it works in the oher version. Blocks were never meant to be full and yet that is exactly what Blockstream and other side-chain peddlers like LightningLabs want...full blocks to create a fee market, and drive users to "side-chains" and 2nd layers. LN is a complete Rube Goldberg joke now, 3 years in the making. Also, for it to scale, larger blocks are needed (the devs admit this). Good luck with that initiative. 
Fees on BTC are "low" now, because txs are at two year lows, if blocks ever approach being full again the fees will once again skyrocket to $50 per. 
You should try the version that works though. You will not go back to the deprecated version. Also, avoid forums that rely on deleting posts and banning dissent. Seek out open discussions.
@_date: 2018-05-25 02:29:17
Fees are not low because of segwit. Go ahead and explain how BTC is working "more efficiently than ever" please. Fees are low because blocks are not full (because tx volume is low, 2016 levels). This is very simple. Look at a chart. 
BTC wants to create a fee market, they say this. the money-version.of bitcoin wants to always have more room in blocks than there is tx. This is a key difference. You can talk all the trash you want. facts remain facts.
@_date: 2018-05-11 04:15:13
? Make sense man. You are projecting. I don't shill. I just use cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 10:09:29
He hasn't written any code. No one ever said he has. So, put that strawman right back in your pocket. He has invested, done BD, marketing, content, created products and companies... you know all those things that every piece of software requires to enter a market. Without Roger you likely would have never heard of Bitcoin. Why so resentful?
@_date: 2018-05-09 09:31:38
Really? Because I looked up "bcash" and couldn't find anything. I've seen Bitcoin Core in magazines and in wallets. Anyway. Only people I've seen saying becash are resentful HODLers. That is fine though. I just use the bitcoin that is most useful as money. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 06:26:37
But I thought Satoshi and his whitepaper were not important anymore? If we listen to Satoshi we probably wouldn't be pushing for side-chains, second layers, and artificially small blocks. We wouldn't be popping champagne to high-fees, etc. I'm confused. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:36:51
For sure, there are no Bitcoin leaders. That might have been better communicated in quotes. I was referring to Blockstream and the mods of this sub who have down-played the importance of both Satoshi and the whitepaper as "historical relics" and even tried, unsuccessfully, to "rewrite" the whitepaper to justify deviating from it's intent, i.e., for Bitcoin to be an electronic p2p cash system. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 08:30:41
Yeah, because what was presented is perplexing. Are you confused too?
@_date: 2018-05-10 07:24:41
Bro, no, it is not moot. Free software doesn't get into the hands of millions without an evangelist. Roger still promotes bitcoin everyday. I do not know many more passionate people who still push and fight for something ten years later. Especially in the face of so much adversity and hostility. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:00:28
 avg BTC fees are actually about $1/tx. Even if they were $.04 that is more than 4x the c . a . s . h .  version. And BTC is currently relatively low fees only because transaction volume is very low (and blocks arent full). If BTC ever becomes used again the mempool will fill and fees will skyrocket.
I agree we don't need other coins than bitcoin. but make sure you sure the correct version that is useful as money. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 08:39:38
If only there were a currency version of Bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:36:22
Bitcoins - check

instant win. 
thank you. well done, sir. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:41:11
Well, I said I am not. And even if I was "angry" what does that have to my positions. Attack the positions, not the man. This is called the '[ad hominem fallacy]( I could exhibit all kinds of various emotions or attitudes and it wouldn't detract from my message. You are trying to distract people by calling me names. So stick to the issues, bud. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 20:34:22
First, a brief word about this “dissent” which you seem to misunderstand as something undesirable. 
Dissent is defined as **“holding or expressing opinions that are at variance with those previously, commonly, or officially expressed”.** 
**Dissent is a suggestion**—an opportunity to consider alternatives. Roger, BU, Haiyang Po, Blocke and others are indeed expressing dissent. You haven’t called them out. They have been dissenting for a while now. And, they are getting stronger because dissent, reinforced with facts and visions of a better world, appeals to other free men who have the courage to think-feely, learn from mistakes, and adjust their positions, accordingly.
Now, onto the destruction of your emotive drivel.  


Since you are asking what the movement consists of—it consists of me and any other free man with the sense to choose which side of a contentious issue he wants to stand on. Who owns my voice? Me, goddamnit. Don’t forget China, the 50+ attendees of the Hard Fork Cafe, the BU developers, and the scores of free people expressing disdain for Core on Twitter and there are none here because they have been purged, you sycophantic wretch.


Well, did or did not the hashrate surge from 3% to 10% overnight? If it didn’t then call him out. If it did, then what’s your point? Also, I would like to clarify that the “propaganda” in question consists of 
* ViaBTC saying “We support big blocks” and 
* Mr. Ver quoting a business truism, “Don't kill or cripple version 1 in favor of an as-yet-unreleased version 2”. 
I cannot tell if your trolling is meant to be ironic, you are a simpleton, or your guilty conscious betrays you since the above two tweets are 1. A free man expressing his opinion and 2. A common sense business maxim applied to our beloved bitcoin.


Yeah, were you there? It was fantastic. There were 50+ attendees total and 20-30 present at any given time. You should get out more. It’s amazing what different opinions can do for the mind of a free man. 


After a huge gathering of miners, bitcoin enthusiasts, and BU folks, ViaBtc started to signal...Gee whiz! It’s almost like they found common ground and made plans to effect the change they want to see in the world. The horror! Free men making deals!


Don’t forget China, the 50+ attendees of the Hard Fork Cafe, the BU developers, and the scores of free people expressing disdain for Core on Twitter and there are none here because they have been purged, you sycophantic wretch.




The only thing that reeks is your neckbeard cheese. John_Blocke created social media accounts, WITHIN HOURS OF EACH OTHER, to spread his views...astounding! Mentioning the figure, Blocke, only weakens your already facile theory that “BU is nothing other than Roger and ViaBtC”. Here we have another free citizen taking to the internet to voice his or her opinion. Blocke’s works are far-reaching, in-depth, and highly informative. You seems to praise the author’s acumen and writing ability. As with most of your kind, it seems your venom is admiration in disguise and derives from an inferiority complex rife with jealousy, and an eagerness to be in the presence of strength only to experience humiliation. 
Your emotive muck-racking grows weaker and weaker. You started out with a catchy title punned from Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman’s, [Manufacturing Consent]( You should read it or [watch]( it. The work introduced the “The Propaganda Model” which ironically describes the machinations of Core (e.g. censorship, bias in reporting, narrative-structuring being beholden to investors, etc) much more so than a free movement like Unlimited’s. 


What is more organic that organizing events, spreading your ideas, gathering like-minded free men and women, and signaling this to the masses? Also, don’t forget China, the 50+ attendees of the Hard Fork Cafe, the BU developers, and the scores of free people expressing disdain for Core on Twitter and there are none here because they have been purged, you sycophantic wretch. 


Finally, your circular drivel has come to an end without an upshot. You began by suggesting there was some conspiracy, I thought you were going to “prove” that Mr. Ver was, in fact, ViaBtc and John_Blocke, China, and every Twitter dissenter and user at once. Alas, you did nothing but come into the room and defecate.  Pee-yew! Maybe that reek you smell is more than just the neckbeard cheese after-all. 
Lastly, may I remind you that dissent is only possible in a **free society**. As a denizen of the co-opted I understand that the light of reason hurts your eyes. But, I urge you and your kind to be strong, cast-off your slave chains and consider alternatives. If, after rational consideration, you disagree then voice those concerns as such. Vicious, albeit comical, diatribes such as this only serve your masters—not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 20:49:29
While, seemingly clever. This analogy doesn't make any sense since the Judas tag applies more to CoreStream than Roger. Jesus did not become Judas. Judas betrayed Jesus. 
There is no case for BU being some kind of secret attempt to destroy or betray bitcoin. Roger and others are personally funding their initiatives with blood sweat and your tears. Quite the opposite can be said about Core and Blockstream. Core is funded by banks. Who seems more likely to have a hidden agenda?
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:48:27
Very well. You are not compelled to address it. But you did and moreover, you addressed me and called me names. So, I challenged you and you retreated like a pissant. Ba'bye, now. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:56:26
That seem true enough... Luke-jr signed it. I wonder where the other core devs are though? Seems they would want to support grants for bitcoin protocol development.
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:34:59
Angry? I'm not angry. And I am certainly not little. Why, I'm here. Ready with my troll shield, neckbeard shears, and nose plug. Why not address the total annihilation, or any of the minor annihilations, within my rebuttal.
@_date: 2018-06-18 07:00:59
Yes, everyone has seen that I hope. I mean, where is he recently? Haven't heard from him other than his trading tips on twitter. As CEO of a hundred million dollar invested company, you would think he would have introduced a product or two by now, no? 
Also, he did not invent Hashcash
All he did was regurgitate and repackage Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor's "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail" from 1992 (5 years before Hashcash).
The paper is even on the hashcash.org website.
Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor
"Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail"
First presented in Crypto'92.
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:36:16
Adam didnt invent Hashcash..look it up. There were two others.
Adam never "directed" Satoshi to do anything. It is likely Adam was in touch with Nakamoto, as were many, prior to the WP.
 1. Any of you read the whitepaper? It describes a p2p cash system. Nakamoto was all for on-chain scaling, describes it in WP and in other writings. 
2. Where is Adam? 
3. Does BS have any products yet?
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:25:57
I agree but be warned this sub is all about "banning accounts it doesn't like".
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:41:38
Fantastic. Open yours eyes sheep, gaze upon the future. 
@_date: 2016-09-02 23:12:52
oh, i was just going by this 
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:53:01
You should use the version of Bitcoin with lower fees, 0-conf, and lightning fast confirmations. Why the hell would anyone take their change and pay the exorbitant fees of BTC?
@_date: 2016-09-02 17:48:21
Idea sounds cool but illegal? Can you just "replace" ads with other Brave ads? I dunno how long this will be a thing but I might try it. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:07:00
I love Bitcoin bro. Don't fight progress. Bitcoin upgraded to preserve the original intent, function, and roadmap. You can come back anytime. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:00:22
Hmmmm, isnt there already a version of Bitcoin that is lightning fast and basically free? LN sounds like a bank... centralize hubs and second layers? How long before a 3rd layer? No thanks, I prefer Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-02 23:14:28
has there been any comment from Brave about: 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:04:10
Yeah, I use Bitcoin for that. I mean the cash version. Aleo, you better be careful, mentioning the whitepaper will get you flamed here..."it's just a historical document, not a roadmap" is how many in here now view it
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:58:42
Any support for Bitcoin (BCH) on these?
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:56:53
hahahahahaha the threads these days defending LN are hilarious.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:46:07
You thought it was dead? Wow, you must live in a cave. Nope, there are around 20-40k tx per day. It's very much in use.
