A blueprint for the next massive revision of how society functions. For now it's money cause that's what we're used to equating as power/influence but when you go down the rabbit hole, you find that nearly every centralized collective of people, resources or any combination of the two would benefit from a block chain esque system. Any time the chain of command trickles up to a select set of affluent individuals you risk corruption of any flavor that applies. That corruption is what bleeds every pyramid dry from the bottom up eventually making its foundation too weak to support its ever growing capstone. Decentralized command structures in government/corporations will allow for faster approval, faster results and easily traceable wrongdoing to substitute for the hand of the 'the man' when someone fucks up. It is a system that governs itself therefor eliminating the need for the greedy/emotional people in charge.
Essentially it automates jobs that have always been done by people who shouldn't have them. As long as the title ceo, pres, manager exists, all the crimes possible via abusing those positions will exist as well. Bitcoin is the start of the revolution. Block chain in general, once well implemented everywhere will solve the problem of greed and corruption by eliminating the possibility for it via a peer to peer command/implementation/varification structure. Only issue is getting it passed all those in power. Just like jp Morgan and Nikola Tesla. Once the elite realize they are investing in their own demise, they will pull out and it will be up to the people to finish block chains work. Likely behind schedule.

Buy low, sell high. Then take you previous investment+profits and spend it all on bitcoin. Rinse repeat until bank account has 6 zeros. Then keep going cause why not?

Yes, so Zimbabwes central bank could inflate it as much as it could as fast as it could because it knows that its time and every other central banks time is limited. This is a bank run except its banks running to themselves.

They can make it illegal all they want but they can't stop it. Disconnect one node and 6 more will pop up. They don't understand what decentralized means. All they know is central everything. Their brains are central.

Soon it will be a small loan of 10 bitcoins.
