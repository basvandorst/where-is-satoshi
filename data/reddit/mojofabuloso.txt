I've seen a number of videos with Krugman. He seems less confident here. He clearly doesn't know what he is talking about and is feeling his way about in the dark. He's a political creature. 
He reminds me of Bagdad Bob, history just has not caught up with him yet:

The people who are clamping down on Coinbase and Circle are trying to dampen excitement about Bitcoin and pinch off the money flowing into it.

I have a trezor and send my BTC to it as soon as they roll in. I'm all about getting out of fiat. The issue here is that it is getting harder to convert fiat to BTC. 
This is a form of price suppression, a silent move to kill Bitcoin. 
Gold and silver have been suppressed via re-hypothication and other fraud, but that does not work with Bitcoin, so now capital controls are being imposed on Bitcoin.
Also, I agree with others who who point out that this is a taste of things to come with fiat only accounts. The purveyors of fiat have a lot of power as long as we are all dependent on their money.

I own a trezor and I withdraw BTC as soon as they roll in. The point here is that it is getting harder to buy BTC with the dollars that I get paid for my labor.

Exactly, this is the fraudulent practice that the open ledge of the blockchain puts an end to.
