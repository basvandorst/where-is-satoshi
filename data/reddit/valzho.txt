Great film; wonderful acting; great cinematography; intriguing, edge-of-your-seat story; well-written, riveting tale. Starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and Gwyneth Paltrow. 9.5 out of 10. Would never ever watch again in my entire life.

I don't understand why it seems like ALL the opponents (vocal ones anyway) to Bitcoin assume that you *HAVE* to mine to use Bitcoins... like that's the *only* thing you can do with bitcoins. It seems like their picture of Bitcoins is that you leave your computer running to "mine" these pieces of digital ether that you then just ... have ... I would think that crazy, too! They completely miss the whole *currency* part of Bitcoin; most people *don't* mine (and shouldn't) just like most people don't pull precious metals out of the ground or print dollar bills—that doesn't stop the majority from *using* those items as an agreed item of exchange.

I think a better analogy would be if I were purchasing something online from Japan using, for example, PayPal. I give PayPal my US dollars via some means or other, they do the conversion, and pay the seller in Yen. Does that mean that I didn't buy something with US dollars? Does it mean that either US dollars or Yen aren't currencies (at least in regards to this scenario)?
I mean, I didn't *make* those US dollars (if I even ever saw physical notes rather than a number on a bank ledger that was direct-deposited from my paycheck). I had to *trade* some work/services in exchange for them. From your example, I raise goats, sell the milk, and used the US dollars to buy my item from Japan. Did I buy it with dollars or yen? Most people would say dollars. If you replace dollars with Bitcoin in the example, it doesn't get treated any differently—most people would then say that I bought my item with Bitcoin.
In the end I think we are treading into a meaningless, and ultimately fruitless, semantic wonderland here.
EDIT: For an example more akin to BitSpend: I raise goats, sell the milk, earn dollars, and then at some point exchange some of my dollars for euros that I keep in a Swiss savings account. Later I use my Swiss account (euros) to fund my PayPal purchase to Japan. Did I pay for my purchase with dollars, euros, or yen? Most people, I think, would say I paid in euros. The fact that at some point in the past I had to trade some amount of dollars to get those euros is meaningless to the transaction. My part in this transaction involved me giving up only euros (not dollars, not goat milk, not yen) as an exchange for some good or service, i.e., *I paid in euros*. The same would be true if the conversion in the transaction went from euros to dollars—again, it is irrelevant to the transaction that the euros in my savings account were obtained with dollars.

Interesting premise... but then, how does a person get money into the system to begin with? How do they have a balance to withdraw from at the ATM? Doesn't seem to fully solve the problem.
This leads my brain to the interesting notion of a bitcoin-backed currency (is that redundant?)... that would be very interesting, indeed.

First off, I'd like to state that I'm very pro-Bitcoin. Having said that, I think the author brings up a very valid point—bitcoin as a universal currency is at a disadvantage in that it requires a very specific capitol investment (the equipment needed to access the internet and/or the bitcoin network) whereas a traditional physical currency does not (i.e. nothing is required to be able to accept and then use a physical note).
I'm wondering what ways could a virtual currency (bitcoin specifically) solve this problem of dependency on specific capitol investment. Is this a problem that even needs to be solved? Is Bitcoin always destined to live alongside some type of physical currency? Would that be a bad or a good thing (or neutral)?
Would love to hear thoughts!
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:13:59
I totally agree with you, but I think it still leaves out the other end of the spectrum: people who don't have a "scalable" amount of money and who certainly can't afford the capital investment for their own access hardware. My mind keeps going back to the question of how would I quickly hand some money to a beggar/homeless person. How could I give *any* amount of Bitcoin to someone that they can spend somewhere without needing anything else.

Umm... I think you have it backwards. Agriculture is much newer than hunting, and the archeological record shows decreased health (decreases height, increase in diseases, worse tooth health, etc) in societies after becoming agrarian. Our bodies work most efficiently running off of fat (which is why it is by far our bodies' preferred store of energy). Calories aren't just calories—you must consider the hormonal effects of the *sources* of the calories much more than the quantity, i.e., carbs, proteins, and fats are digested, transported, stored, and used much differently from one another. ... but... we're in the wrong thread for all of this...

One thing that I think others aren't really clear about in their clarifications is addressing this point... To be clear, **no one person can change the network, or add to the pool without the consent of the entire network; there is no controlling entity upon which the fate and direction of Bitcoin resides.**
One anonymous person (known only as Satoshi) invented Bitcoin. Then, that invention was made open source for a community of developers to implement. The entire system, by design, is a peer-to-peer network—every node on the network has equal status with every other node, and every node has the "master list" so to speak. That means that if a node on the network alters its copy of the master list in an incongruous way or goes down, the rest of the network ignores it and keeps working as usual. Compare this to a client-server setup where the server is the only computer with the "master list"; whoever controls it controls everything, and, if it goes down, the whole network goes down.
**Backed by Math**
This is how all the nodes know that they are on the same page, i.e., we don't trust the node, we trust the math that all of their information is based on. All of the bitcoins/transactions in the "master list" are generated by complex cryptographic functions incorporating prior bitcoins/transactions. In other words, every bitcoin is mathematically derived from all the bitcoins that came before it, and altering one will alter all the bitcoins that come after it, thus, you can say that bitcoin is "backed by math". The algorithms generating each transaction/bitcoin are incredibly compute-intensive which means that transactions are very hard to fake... and even if you managed somehow to create a counterfeit bitcoin, it would clash with an actual bitcoin on the network at large. In such a case, you would have to control 51% of all the computing power on the network for your fake bitcoin to be accepted as legitimate (the 51% attack); the Bitcoin network is so tremendously large at this point that performing such an attack isn't really economically feasible considering the amount of computing power you would have to buy just to pull it off.
**Open Source**
The program is open source which means that anyone in the world at any time can look at the code and see that it does exactly what it is supposed to do. That means that there is a huge potential pool of developers working to make the system better. Because it is a peer-to-peer network, if someone were to write some malicious code, they would have to get everyone on the network to adopt their malicious code for it to do them any good. Again, no single entity can hijack the system because everyone on the network has to agree about everything... As above, you can't just "make" Bitcoins on your own because 1) each bitcoin is mathematically derived from all previous bitcoins 2) once you "mine" a bitcoin everyone else on the network has to agree to its underlying mathematical structure. So, if you took the software and made your own tweaks to generate bitcoins somehow, your network would instantly be out of sync with the rest of the network (and thus, ignored by the rest of the network).
**Trustless by Nature** 
When millsdmb writes that the system is "trustless by nature", they are referring to the fact that you don't have to trust anyone one entity on the network (only the network as a whole, which is very robust and spans the globe). Compare this to other systems: you have to trust your bank to give you your savings deposit back when you ask for it, you have to trust that your bank won't go bankrupt, you have to trust the government not do devalue your money by printing tons of currency, you have to trust that a check you take from someone will be honored by their bank, you have to trust that a credit card company won't reverse the charges on a payment to you, you have to trust that PayPal won't arbitrarily freeze and seize all of the funds in your account because they didn't like something you did, and so on. Bitcoins assigned to an address can only be controlled by the person with the private key to that address. Period. No freezes. No seizures. Once you send/receive funds, there are no reversals or chargebacks. When a transaction is made on the Bitcoin network (transferring bitcoin from one address to another), every single node on the entire network (the largest peer to peer network in the world, I believe) has a record of that transaction. You can take steps so that the sending and receiving addresses in a transaction can't be tied to anyone, and thus have reasonably good anonymity in a transaction, but the transaction itself is known to every node on the network, again making fake transactions nigh impossible. You can wait (usually about 10 minutes or so) to receive confirmation from several nodes on the network as to a transaction's legitimacy, but once its there its there. No fake checks, no "it's in the mail", no unexpected chargebacks days later, you either get the funds or you don't, and you know it very quickly.

We switched to WP8 a little over a year ago, and it is the best phone I have ever owned (with Android my wife and I had a string of... giving Android the benefit of the doubt we'll just call it bad luck. Never owned iOS.) I would seriously doubt that it is any more secure, though.

More like, interested in preventing anyone from participating in any form of commerce unless they are willing to offer their allegiance to him (sounds a bit like J.P. Morgan and the Fed, doesn't it?). In our modern Western world where the vast majority of people can only fend for their basic needs by purchasing food, clothing, and shelter from someone else, this would be a powerful form of manipulation indeed.

Excellent points, but none of them address the actual topic: requisite capital investment for involvement with Bitcoin. If you want to use Bitcoin you have to have some type of computer with internet access... or regular access to such equipment.
For example, if you want to give money to a homeless guy on the street, chances are he won't be able to do much with Bitcoin—if you can first find out a way to give it to him (something like a barcoded slip from a Bitcoin ATM as voiceofxp mentioned perhaps?).

We should throw gun manufacturers in jail, because the only *real* reason that anyone buys guns is to commit crime. While we're at it, we can throw auto makers in jail with them since cars are involved in so many deaths, traffic violations, DWIs, etc. /s
