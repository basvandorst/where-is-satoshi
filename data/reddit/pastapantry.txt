One transaction finally confirmed earlier tonight. Other one still unconfirmed... But it's only for $200 so not nearly as nervous about that one :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:21:02
And crazy fees. I have been watching and buying Bitcoin since 2011 and this is nuts. I thought for sure fees would have calmed down by now. 
Someone needs to set up an altruistic mining pool that just mines all the low fee tx's. Hahaha... Fuck me.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:48:47
I actually had this very same thought last week and posted it here
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:44:26
Can't do that securely because the seller would know the private key. I suppose you could sue them if they sweep the wallet after you pay them. If you can find them
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:06:12
Sorry to break it to you but that's a fake
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:42:55
Pretty close but run a Linux live CD first and do it from there. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:03:23
Not really 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:00:57




Good point
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:29:31
I had a 20 sat/b transaction and one for 11sat/b stuck since Sunday just confirmed on Friday. Finally! Still a lot shorter than 90 day settlement with visa 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:46:21
Yes it is. It would imply the code can be reviewed. Not that it is, but that it can be.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:43:19
Bread is open source
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:31:01
this is just a screenshot of the transaction on blockchain.info.. not his actual wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:07:14
No kidding. Wow
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:32:31
it doesn't, he's an idiot
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:11:17
Yeah. Confirmation just makes the transaction immutable. Compare the standard 6 confs which take what like an hour or two to get at most, to 90 days for credit cards. To me, it's more than reasonable still. Malleability is a problem though.

You... Didn't use protection?
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:10:23
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:59:52
I think we're seeing it.
@_date: 2016-11-17 14:04:06
You mean "aggregate value". 
@_date: 2016-11-03 01:17:47
I don't know how the end user is supposed to verify the strain using the blockchain. The best you could do is verify the QR code on the jar links to the bitcoin transaction(s) referencing the strains DNA. Unless they're planning on selling DNA sequencing machines end users could obtain the sequence themselves from, to then verify that.
@_date: 2016-12-31 20:52:40
Maybe into web based versions of office, or files stored on onedrive, since nobody would see the traffic. But there is no way this is happening with desktop based software. That kind of traffic would have been found out by now and you would be able to verify this yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:10:04
Looks like I might have to wait up to 14 days, and not open bitwallet in that time, to ensure it does not rebroadcast the tx?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:27:04
This guy taxes
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:28:09
I don't get it. Once the tx is broadcast and you can see it with 0 confirms, Isnt that the equivalent (in terms of risk to the seller) of buying something with visa, but the transaction hasn't been posted yet? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:24:21
So in theory this could remain unconfirmed forever if miners never process the tx?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:21:16
Thank you pot!
@_date: 2016-09-01 03:01:00
If it had closed ports they wouldn't know redis is on the antminers. Shodan works off port probing.
@_date: 2016-09-01 01:03:10
You shouldn't pay, because the thing doesn't encrypt anything it just deletes things.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:05:47
This guy bitcoins. 
Seriously, I've been around since 2010 and the community has changed so much, for the worse.
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:17:46
Because bitcoin is unregulated, anything can be done
@_date: 2016-09-01 01:04:16
Interesting to note Antminer in the list of devices with open redis. It may be possible to take over a Bitcoin mine with this exploit.
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:06:34
Man you guys haven't been in crypto long, huh
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:09:56
Let them fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:12:33
He's not wrong
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:32:33
With electrum when you make a new wallet day import from seed. Write the first twelve words in and there is an option somewhere for extended seed... You'll then enter the additional six words in the next page. Sorry for the shitty description, on mobile.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:30:06
That is not at all what happened. Shitpost
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:57:35
... in the US.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:38:20
Great idea
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:39:13
With a trident no less
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:25:36
But you never validified ;(
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:21:41
And the phone
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:13:34
Wow, that's pretty terrible even for a rap song. Nice try though
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:44:09
You're paying for the convenience and anonymity (if you pay with cash). Still worth it in a volatile market
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:05:13
The wicks are the high and low point of the price for that interval. The body is the start and end price
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:21:01
Where does that link go? I don't know what they're talking about
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:18:13
Probably less terrorism financed by crypto than with good ol fashioned international currency, US bank notes.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:01:50
Yes my bad I should say chain split
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:06:09
You've gone and taken the words right out of my mouth
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:21:18
I know some of these words
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:08:36
So you're proposing a hard fork, except you want to be the guy who gets to name it. Lol
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:12:55
I hope so. mmmmmm cheap coins.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:40:00
Can’t trade without having coins on an exchange
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:27:04
This guy fucks
@_date: 2016-07-06 04:15:03
You're telling me Microsoft sells you these keys for less than $10 a piece huh? Hook me up with your disty; I could sell these for half retail price all day long.
