I did all that, 0 transactions, 0 unspent.  I was on the account with 0 balance, I selected "Receive" and then "Copy to clipboard" and emailed the address.  I eyeballed the address at the time and it matched.  I am hoping this is an spv lag issue or something.

I am missing something.  I followed your link, and its link to the IRS.  I don't see any "requirement" to have an email address for compliance.  The only thing I see is for a contributor to claim the deduction, they would need a written communication, in which case you would send this to their email address.  If this is correct, an option should be available to contribute without providing an email address for those who do not itemize or otherwise would wish to remain anonymous.

Or maybe you can be so bold as to challenge [Pieter Wuille](
@_date: 2019-02-13 04:16:52


Each "private key", provides a signature, which is verified against the public key and a hash of the public key(in the most simple example, but it can be more complicated) there is absolutely no encryption, a technical detail, cryptography(signing, hashing, verifying) yes, encryption, no.  Yes I am serious.


Again not so simple, a multisig can have several keys to unlock a utxo, do they all have the "balance"?, but it all boils down to the script, not necessarily the keys.

Sorry, I am just correcting inaccurate information for those who want to learn, hopefully you want to learn so please look up the terms "hash" and "encryption", you will see, or you can just keep challenging me with inaccurate assumptions, this is the best I can do, I am done, do with the info as you wish.

Lightning could be a good solution, but BTC IMO is a better coin because of [segwit]( which opens the door for layer 2 solutions(lightning...) among other things and allows the system to be upgraded with soft fork(I here this frequently from devs but don't see mentioned in the link, would like to see an explanation of how this would work?).

They get paid the same per block, a block will still be every 10 minutes, worse case they will burn less electricity if it causes lower difficulty, so probably fees will drop, but that is the whole point of bch fork, to lower fees, I don't think this should be a concern but maybe I am missing something

I am not going to read yet another propaganda piece from them, but based on this response, 
 They always refer to the title of the whitepaper, not sure if they are aware that the whitepaper has content, but it mentions 1 cpu 1 vote, neither branch is close to this, but the bigger blocks(bitcion-abc) vs efficient use of blocks(bitcoin) is easy to predict which solution would be closer, but this is irrelevant anyway, in order for the bch nodes to have centralization issue there would need to be activity, with 100k block that have been actually produced most of the history except for the coinbase surge, neither bandwidth nor disk space is a concern, the only remaining concern is are there enough nodes for decentralization since the use is minimal.  And they are both "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", look up the definition of cash, they just want to re-define it.
 go to the bitcoin and bitcoin-abc repositories and look at the commits.  abc has deadalnix doing 99%(ok, I did not calculate but a vast majority) of the work, and most of that is back porting commits from bitcoin, and obviously what you said, anyone can fork it.  The whole "look what happened with Gavin" nonsense is total BS, look [here]( it shows inactivity for some time before access removal, and an unsigned commit, which was legitimate cause for concern.  I did not see him begging to have access re-instated.

Do you mean seasons or episodes?  You can purchase current episodes or season on amazon, previous seasons are free with prime
EDIT: I guess you can watch for free at usanetwork.com if you have usa and an online account set up with your cable provider.  I don't have cable so I just wait until it is free on amazon

Noticed that the protocol version is the same, so if you are running a node just to support the network, there is no benefit in upgrading?  If you are using the wallet, or are a dev and want to experiment with creating transactions on bech32 addresses it is worth doing, unless this was a mistake to leave the protocol version the same, I see [related changes]( but not sure if any warrent a version bump???
