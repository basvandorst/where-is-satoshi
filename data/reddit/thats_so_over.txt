i have some... trying to figure out how to do stellar using ledger manager.
I have stellar installed on the nano now but i'm not sure how to access the wallet?  Any tips? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:10:34
Yep me too. 
Looks like I can store them on my nano but I haven’t figured it out yet.

so i just sent from GDAX to my segwit address on my nano using the chrome wallet... i'm hoping I'm good.
How long will i have to wait to see it show up? I did a small test run before i move my entire stack.

As long as you don’t freak out when it drops to like 6-7k you’ll be fine.

Cool... but what side are you on?

With all this new found loot are you going all in at once or dca to get it all?

I just got a Coinbase account through iOS and bought some bitcoin.  
I can’t find anything about seed words or my private key or anything like that.
Am I missing something?

What’s the site?  
I got an unopened one from amazon but I think I’m going to return it and order direct.   
Or is that not really needed?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:26:50
Maybe a better word would be possible...
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:04:39
Cool.  So I just get a different hardware wallet and transfer them in?
I’m only a week into my bitcoin journey so I don’t have much yet.  But I know I’m going to want to have my private key and store most of my coins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:11:34
Yep, and it’s a digital infrastructure that can scale globally and securely... if it remains popular.  
Fingers crossed.  I just got my first .1 bitcoin yesterday.

What is the easiest way to get into trading bitcoin?
