Buying a coffee and sending your US wages to your family in Mexico are two very different use cases. It works much better for the latter than for the former.

I'm no accountant, so i'm not sure, but if you live in the US I think you might actually be on the hook for capital gains if the euro rises against the dollar. I agree that it sucks, but the rules are the rules.

What are the implications if I did a little bit of the ol' sell low =&gt; buy high? What I sold was above cost basis, but then i had to buy back at a higher price, with a net loss of btc.

It doesn't have to be. 




It's your property, you sell it for profit, that's capital gains. You can avoid capital gains and maybe get away with it, or maybe you don't...

I know the dumps are upsetting, but [things are still looking ok IMHO.](
Just hodl on, we'll turn this thing around eventually.

If someone is willing to explain, what's this about certifying the authenticity of the art using blockchain? Couldn't the auth code just be copied to a fraud copy?

Is this a test? Would you put all that money on a hand of blackjack?
