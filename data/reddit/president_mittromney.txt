I've tried it a couple times, and it always crashed. Is this how you promote BitShares and pretend like problems don't exist? Why would anyone believe that 2.0 will work if 1.0 doesn't?

Thanks for the answer re 1.0 vs. 2.0.

Don't you need a working 1.0 before trying to hype up a 2.0? BitShares is unusable.

That's really too bad, Poloniex was a great exchange. It's clear that it's now time we start supporting decentralized exchanges as a community. [Mercury]( is one, and the upcoming [B&amp;C Exchange]( is in fundraising right now. We need a Bitcoin exchange that is free from identity requirements.

What network effect? Less than 0.0001% of the world uses Bitcoin in any meaningful way beyond speculation. With no switching costs (other than small exchange trading fees) there is no friction to switching to better alternatives. I concede it might be much different if BTC was used by the majority of the world like USD, but it is nowhere near that state.

You will notice I simply reversed "speech" and "money" in your post. Your argument is bad and you should feel bad. If a Bitcoin competitor delivers more innovation, Bitcoin will die. Just like the telegraph.
