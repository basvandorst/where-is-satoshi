The bad thing on bitcoin now is that it cant be use for micropayments coz of high fees and slow transactions as it was before - at the beginnings. Thats why people are hold it more as a value than usual currency.

Happy b-day btc. We hope that next 10 years will be even more amazing.

There is always risk of attack but its unlikely at this time.

Bitcoin is like a gold. Its already too big to disappear from the world but its real value is not only in holding but more in a using if our technology will allows us. If not other coins will do this role.

Its hard to generalize coz every country has different tax law system. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:25:02

No one can predict where is the bottom. Same as no one knew the bitcoin price year ago. We should try to attract investors by proving real-world use. If the next "thing" is lightining network then lets make it very clear where is the real added value.
