Didn't think of that, of course you are right. No reason for Google to use throwaways...

I was a 300 member for years. But the website lay dormant with no updates or changes...
I cancelled it eventually after they told me for the 10th time news was 'coming'... Didn't know where my money was going in the end.
Still not sure where that few thousand went.

Anything that comes from the Abbott government won't be influential.
This is coming from the same guy who appears to be trying to convince world leaders we don't have a climate problem to keep his big mining buddies onside.

Chill out shibe, no hate in my speech, read it again.
Google mods approached the bitcoin community for suggestions on how to best use BTC with Google.
Dogecoin saw the opportunity to jump the queue and mass up vote one suggestion.
I personally have a few hundred thousand doge, so I don't mind if it takes off, but I am an advocate of protocol and getting BTC integrated with Google will pave the way for many cryptos.
I think it's unwise to confuse the issue with side information as ultimately it slows the path of least resistance.
I could say the same to you. If you are so confident doge will share a space with BTC then please wait your turn rather than interrupting an existing conversation.

Good advice, thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:50:04
Frustrated... Any help would be appreciated.
I copied my BTC from one Armory wallet to a new Armory wallet.
Swept the private keys from the old wallet into Electron Cash and the balance says 0.
What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:30:53
It seems to me that unlike with the Ethereum split, this split has created a coin that has faster transactions, but is less widely adopted.
Am I missing something? It is tempting as someone who has 30 coins to quickly sell his 30 Bitcoin Cash for another 3-4 Bitcoins.
But am I missing something here. Is there an actual chance that Bitcoin Cash grows - which will likely bring the price of BTC slowly down and BCH slowly up, and diversification is instead the best route?
Ultimately I'll probably hedge my bets a little and sell half. I can't see it being a quick process for a Portland bar to start adding BCH as a payment method when BTC is the main staple.
I think the piece of the puzzle I'm missing, is this. If there are problems inherent with BTC, are they still fixable within BTC? Or is BCH the only corrected, faster better option.
I have been reading but threads are not all clear.

Remind Me Bot here, buy some damn dice!
@_date: 2016-05-30 14:20:39
No, it doesn't make any sense.
What I normally do is move these things to my Armory account but the transaction and balance isn't showing this happened.
I was drinking. Ugh.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:29:06
Now they are asking for some additional verification after I already had verified to 100% satisfaction. Groan...
Probably a Skype chat with them and a bunch of back and forth.
Companies like this make the smooth instant flow of Bitcoin seem like archaic stilted bureaucracy...
No bueno.

Hi, how long to withdraw coins? It says 24 hours. Why isn't it instant? The blockchain has not even registered the withdrawing address?!
I'm really getting frustrated here.
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:08:12
twice now, and messaged the igot guy here on reddit...
This is how to not keep customers. I'll keep riding them, even though it's only been a couple days. Don't want it to drag.

That guy was being a dick. Merry Xmas. 2014 is going to be spectacular for all of us :)
Edit: just saw I could learn something from you, seems you tipped the guy who was being rude. Life lesson there.
I need to learn how to use tipbot cause it's people like you who deserve a share in paying it forward. Good on ya mate.
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:38:10
Thank you! And is there any reason I can't run both?  Transferring is free correct?

Video editor and Internet marketer here. Are you looking for partners?
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:30:53
Thanks for this, I just saved your Armory video to watch later.
Do you see either Armory or Electrum being more secure than each other?
Is there any trust involved in using this method of security?
I see in another thread that you use Electrum, any specific reasons?
Love your work. I hope there is a simple trustworthy method for security adopted widely soon because as coins near $1000 each I worry about an exchange taking off with the $ and everyone going into a panic spiral without the education on places to store coins. Mine have been sitting in an exchange forever now... Time to wallet up!

If they are smart they will run the purchase through an Amazon affiliate link and pick up another 5% kickback. Perhaps then reduce the service fee...
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:05:46
It would be nice to cut it out really - it wastes time on BTC-e and I could just stick my BTC in cold storage and stop thinking about trading.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:24:12
Thanks - I can't see it as worth 1/4 - there's too many variables besides the 21/84 million argument, but yes - interesting coin. I still have 100... perhaps I will sit on them.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:44:01
Not only did you do the right thing, but it's likely that the missing funds would have been followed through the blockchain - a small slip up would have outed you, and then the results could have been upsetting, or legal.
You did the right thing, and are the kind of guy I wish worked for me already.
Don't worry about college fees - education is going free and online exponentially - I expect you will have options far less expensive very soon.
You never had that money - you just held it for a minute, and didn't run off down the street with it. It speaks volumes about your character. Be proud of yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:26:51
I love you b1tcoins4nta, but not sure that worked...
There seems to be a | or something before that command and it didn't come through?
I'm trying to work out whether I'm just an idiot at my end by learning this bitcoin tipbot system... 
Sent you Gold anyway - thanks mate.

This is why I love cold storage. I can only watch and panic is pointless. 
In fact I'm wishing the banks were open so I could buy more, sadly the cheap coins will be gone before I wake up tomorrow...
Might need to get some fiat into an exchange to buy at opportune moments like this in future. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:43:24
Probably delete this post, and do not open any links in pm's.

Just sold about half of them at as close to 0.05 parity as I could...
Even so, there was a dip as soon as I did which restabilized but it just confirms what a nervous market it is...
Will keep around 80-120 coins and swicth it off I think.
