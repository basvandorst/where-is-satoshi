Would owning a trezor avoid all of this? A gambling website suggested I setup with coin base but I never did. They clearly stated DO NOT under any circumstances say it is gambling related

should I just request a check? I have done that once and did receive it 8 weeks later. I haven't cashed it yet though
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:20:42
Yes, once. I got a check but have not cashed it yet
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:15:33
I know but they have already sent me a check for $2,500 so I don't think it's a scam
Edit: unless they can somehow steal coins from my wallet (there isn't any in there). I do plan on making the smallest deposit ($5.00 in bitcoins). After that, they say in 24,-96 hours they will send me as much as $5,000 in coins

The money is still sitting in my account with the online bookie so I don't have it in bitcoin. I setup an account with coinbase months ago, I just don't know what to do with it once it is in there. I am in the USA where online gambling is illegal

You're now the 2nd person to say it sounds like a scam...I don't think it is to be honest but it is kind of odd. They recommend coinbase but "DO NOT under any circumstances say it is gambling related". I have read on here that coinbase has froze accounts because stuff is gambling related so if the website I use knows this why would they suggest coinbase???

Best explanation I could've asked for. Thanks!

I got mine a month ago and I paid $139. I now have 3 coins stored away on it.
