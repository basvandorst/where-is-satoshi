For sure. Where are the fake receipts that they are talking about? and how was this duped? Even so blockchain would have noticed it and infrormed them.

Thats a pretty smart move from MtGox. Driving the prices really high for people to notice them and think that they are actually a good company to sell your BTC with. But once ppl think its the best trading site and get sufficient money to support the ppl in the company, who are just going to run in the end. They say they were hacked eventhough they have no proof or even a picture of a random address taking their BTC. Well played.

Its all up to you. It's like playing a game, you spend alot of money on cheap gear stuff that may become rare someday and sell it by then. If you have a bad temper and want things to be easy and quick, I suggest you not join because it won't easy for sure.

I find it to be good now rather than have a fake company boosting it and losing bitcoins at the same time. (AKA MtGox) Atleast now we don't need to worry about it dropping 500 unless another big issue comes in.

Thats why there is hearings on court thats why they can't just ban it out of the blue.
