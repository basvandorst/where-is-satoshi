Im actually with you on this. Im wondering if there is a way to keep legacy alive and dominant.

Do it faggots

This isnt good. Looks like we are all going to have to switch over to LiteCoin or Perfect Money. Bitcoin is dead

Waiting on those ASIC cards. When will you be launching those?

OP's opening statement really does not make any sense. Reading it, entertaining it for more than a second, is the only thing that is counter-productive. When gold was on the rise did more people buy it or less? Higher prices only discourage pessimists that dont understand economics or value. And in any market I am glad that the ignorant are scared away.

Feel free to add you ideas for GPU and Case (and any other parts that you think I should have).
Everything is purchased either through Bitcoinstore.com or I buy Amazon gift cards through Gyft with bitcoins and then order the parts from Amazon

Check out what AmazonBitcoins[dot]com uses. Its a nice set-up. Each customer gets an individual address and as soon as a payment is made (by the customer) the customer automatically receives an email that is a receipt of payment. For your phone service each customer should get their own unique address and have a similar set-up. That way you and the customer are both absolutely clear on what has been paid for.

Just created an account and I cant wait to try the service out. I have been waiting for a while for a no hassle way to purchase coins. Up until now I have been buying little bits from a friend that I met on the forum. I wonder of ZigGap is ever going to take paypal. That would be great. I wouldnt ever pull my $$ out of paypal, I would just buy coins directly from my paypal account

Glad to know...now. Earlier today I tried to call because I was having problems making an order and got a voicemail Meanwhile the website said it was not currently taking orders. So now I am really confused. I was sitting at Wal-Mart with $$ in hand. Couldnt order on the site, couldnt get anyone on the phone. mmmmmkay

I dont understand what the advantage would be for anyone to try and temporarily takedown an information site.

This is great. It is very hard to get non-tech savvy people to understand and use PGP. For secure msgs I have been using Cryptobin and having to send the password to the recipient thru other means (like text message or email). So I am excited about this idea and platform
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:10:52
Awesome. Thanks. I will give this a whirl 
@_date: 2013-02-25 19:38:12
Im excited! I buy so much stuff from Amazon. I just sent 0.18, so that should be around $5. Look forward to see how well this works out!

The only problem was that I got a voicemail when I needed to talk to someone. I was about to place the order but when I pulled up the site it said ziggap was not taking orders. That is when I tried to call to see if ot was going to be a temporary situation (that would be cleared up hopefully in a little while) or something that might go on for some time. But I couldnt leave a voicemail and wait around wal-mart. I couldnt have an incoming call coming in bc I was heading into an important meeting. So no voicemail was left. Last ZIGGAP thread that mentioned problems ordering had a staff member reply on the thread here that they shouldve called. I thought "Oh good, they have phone support in case I need it." sure enough I needed it and it wasnt available. Its ok. If youre up and running I will try again tomorrow or the next day
PS-Any chance you are going to add Paypal option?

Thats because PayPal turned into little Eichmann's. So if I call tomorrow before making a purchase will someone be available on the toll free  Basically I want to know if all I really need is the receive code, the Account # of bill to pay, and the ZipZap name. In other words, is that account # linked directly to my ZIGGAP account? After making the "bill pay" do you know to send the coins to the BTC address I put on file in my ZIGGAP account or do I have to follow up or email you any additional info?
@_date: 2013-02-25 19:52:51
Yeah but they were terrible, the sites usually looked shady, etc
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:42:53
Awesome! I am going to give it a shot tomorrow. Is there a difference between using Wal-Mart or CVS? Is one preferable to the other?
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:45:44
It IS ugly. But as long as it worked a few times then that was all that matters I guess. Sad

Its ironic that one of the bitcoin wallet sites that tried to be the most secure gets whacked. I started receiving codes to my cell phone recently as if someone was trying to get into my inputs.io wallet. I ignored it because I never get more than $5 USD worth of BTC in that wallet. But because of te frequency of the text message verifications I was receiving, I knew it was only a matter of time before my wallet got hit as well as others
@_date: 2013-02-25 20:04:08
Awesome, instantly got a very professional looking email telling me they received my payment! And started a chat to test response time; the time for getting someone live was under one minute. Thats a major plus
@_date: 2013-02-25 20:24:52
BAM! Got the email with the code. Thanks guys! Two thumbs up on this site as well as the customer service! Sending second payment now

*No Charge Backs
*No Fees
*More secure than using any kind of card. For example, having someones address does nothing for you. Whereas having someones debit or credit card can cause problems
*More valuable than cash and is currently going up in value
