Sup Dopeness!
So the "gox" shirts are almost here, If you're even still interested. I'd just need your shipping address to calculate postage. I'm gonna squeeze these things in a box or envelope, try to reduce the cost.
And since i',m realizing now how bad i am at setting up an ecommerce shop, the tees are all $20USD either way, plus shipping. I originally had USD at $25 and Btc  but since i suck at this commerce tech, i just wanna get these shirts out to ppl as easily as i can. i figured i'd ask you what method of payment you'd best be comfortable with.
Thru Coinbase i think i can send you a link to send BTC, even if you don't have a Coinbase account. Or may we can just let paypal handle it.
Whatever works best for you! Just let me know! Sorry to bug you again!
Take care!

In an AP raw footage test I saw on YouTube, I recall Satoshi briefly  saying, I'm paraphrasing " cruise missiles, blah blah blah..." That, to me is what he was working on at his government contacted job. Something, understandably, he still cannot talk about and would fear taking about if randomly approached. 
It leads me to believe that he was thinking that Leah was investigating his role in that field, not Bitcoin. 
I'll try to link the video. 
Ok, here: 
Watch "California Man Denies Creating Bitcoin | EXTENDED AP TEST" on YouTube

Lol, ya'll really interested in one? I guess I can start getting quotes. Pm me for sizes. If I get enough interest I think I might make em. 
If not..... well fuck it! Maybe they'll become stickers!

And exactly what someone would say if they had worked on classified government systems in their past and might have misunderstood the reporters questions. Not to mention, all while dealing with an elderly mother, and battling financial hardship following a declining career and health problems. 
Imagine if that was you, dude! You think you'd be on point?

Doh!!!! Sorry dude, im a dork. Didn't realize that mistake. Haha, thanks.

I stopped reading their site when I read an article about a hedge fund getting into crypto. It was incredible how lax any fact checking actually went into the article.  Calls into question their entire process for publication. 
In other words, pretty lame. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:45:56
Alright, I feel like this makes sense in a more "content provider" type way. It'll allow Netflix to market themselves like Redbox. Streaming newer titles at a competitive price, using one time payments with btc. All alongside their current subscription model.  It can also allow their original content to be bought , al a carte. Even creating a marketplace like iTunes where content can be bought, easily using btc. Pay per view seems like a natural fit too.

Haha, was just having fun tonight watching the charts. Felt like making something.

I think there might be grounds for a suit. I mean, negligence comes to mind. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:29:42
Well, i'm just seeing if it's possible. I'm the artist that made it last night, but i have to see how the interest of everyone plays out before jumping into anything. 
If nothing really happens, think i might make some stickers or something.

I gotta say, that video and website didn't exactly scream "legit" to me. There's a lot of just generic info on there. I dunno, just saying...

Good thing for 2 factor.

Awesome! Thanks man. Was trying to track down his write up and just could not find it. 
Much appreciated!

Can you perhaps link to Mike's article?

A great rational for his opinion on the matter. And from a guy with such a deep experience with new types of financial developments. 
I guess I should start forging my Plan B in case what he says comes sooner rather than later. Or if at all.
