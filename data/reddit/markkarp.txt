can i ask how many BTC? i have 32 bitcoin &amp; yes paying 2 btc up front without knowing anything of further costs seems high to me considering its group action.  Might only get a fraction of the BTC back also.
If they truly want to help why not small application fee &amp; then take a % of winnings?

why is pokerstars not accepting bitcoin ?

i guess we just wait to see if selachii will post &amp; defend or address any of these and other concerns.  : /  .  i did end up reading through that thread in the end like you, i can see from a customer care point of view alone if nothing else it doesnt look good.
mtgox claim they are protected right now hmmm

@_date: 2014-03-04 20:26:53
that means you need gox, they seem to be tricky to communicate with

@_date: 2014-09-22 08:17:08
its blocked for copy write issue can someone upload it someone else on youtube?
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:58:14
After seeing selachii trying to gox everyone on fees - it probably killed their group size entirely.   Any groups/lawyers looking to gox people will get less sign ups. 
You should probably take a vote on how to do things, maybe have some volunteers to help you if needed.
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:38:20
can you post the recording on youtube or can someone confirm site is legit?
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:29:14

An open debate is best vs private emails.  That gives best results for clients.  
This is bitcoin, land of open source, email is closed source.
Private email for generalized topics is shady, everyone knows this.

We can be accurate, we can redo agreements, we can edit over stuff.  The misquote of the wrong law firm is gone now. You will be treated fairly.
This is a group legal case we dont need privacy for most of details.  Please discuss on forums &amp; lets solve this.  Nobody is begrudging you a a healthy fee at the end.  You have almost no competition on the 2 biggest bitcoin forums so you can relax.
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:46:59
Change the site to this......
All questions to be auto posted in.... reddit(?) and you pick the top answer to publish.
^if the site functioned like this i would link it to every newbie when asked about BTC
or just have a top answer feature actually lol
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:22:40
so is that site not a scam then to get a good quality email list? 
they have no details about which law firm

open bazaar babyyyyyyy yaRRRRRRRRRR!
@_date: 2014-07-24 08:15:53
yeah thinking more it has to be a community effort for best quality answers, for example this here:
How does Bitcoin work?
There are two ways to understand how Bitcoin works under the hood:
    If you're a programmer, read the source code. It's freely available and 100% transparent.
    If you're not a programmer, read Satoshi's white paper.
if a newbie asks "how does bitcoin work" they usually just want a basic answer like..... bitcoin works by a large computer network which allows you to transfer money/value from 1 point to another without needing a bank/3rd party
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:38:46
yeah haha good 1
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:53:25

$1200 up front is too high for just an application process.
I dont see why they cant just charge either a tiny fee or no fee to begin, there is a potential big pay day if they were to win.  
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:38:35
then why did gox say the coins were stolen ?
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:53:34
maybe thats why they filed for chapter 15 &amp; not 11?
if they try &amp; take everything i will just have to go after mark k personal holdings, no other choice.
They said the same about fulltiltpoker that it had no chance, that it was dead brand etc, it had almost exact same problems, infact they had zero money.  People are fickle, also fresh blood in bitcoin all the time + share holders will all be "advertising" gox.

makes me think they have found the 670k?

Yeah but the price they pay you within the space of a second cant be used as the objective value either.  Real value is somewhere between market and experts opinion.

Good luck and ty
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:47:45
No i get there are other coins, but how come this one is getting mentioned, even exchanges have made a statement. If i invent shittycrapcoin today it gets no mention.

@_date: 2017-11-08 18:49:50
yeah so i did the import private key of the address and rescan the bitcoinabc and its not showing the balance, yet i know it should be there. fuck, now out of ideas, maybe a new wallet but dont know what to trust.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:58:14
Sent crypto to bittrex and they've not processed my deposit properly. My ticket is  open for 2 days no support.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:26:41
shit sorry put it in wrong sub, how come wallet.dat does not transfer private key over though dont get it
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:02:40
ok i will try that after a walk, been going at this all day, cheers
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:37:34
like... the wallet.dat, does it not store the private key on it? how come i cant just make bitcoinABC read a wallet.dat backup to access bch ? that make sense ? why does it have to be the private key import route (something i have no experience with)
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:39:47
to get it solved, which it now is
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:56:25

@_date: 2017-11-07 18:00:47
are you crazy did you see my post, i sent crypto to bittrex and its not shown up and they dont answer support.  You know there are many people the same right ?
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:38:52
i sent crypto to bittrex 2 days ago and its not shown up at my bittrex account (its confirmed on blockchain). + they have not answered my support ticket.  The crypto went to the correct address and i sent them details.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:44:58
Request 
nope its sent to the same place i always send coins
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:48:56
sure im sure many people did, it worked for me fine before for months, this last deposit didnt though and my tickets unsolved after 48 hours, my ticket number    there is no support rushing to solve the problem, do you see any? its worrying, i'd withdraw if i were you.
@_date: 2017-04-14 18:15:49
Isn't the hash rate supporting BU misleading? as in its just mostly 1 mining opperation. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 18:13:07

@_date: 2017-05-17 07:27:38
How will you know when you have waited long enough?  how do you know its dropped out of a mempool ? (i dont understand what mempool is sorry.
i have a withdraw from an exchange stuck on zero confirms for around 20 hours myself.
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:48:45
if that guy who did that previously held how poor you think he is now?
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:52:15
oh yeah for sure, i was in A &amp; E nearly a year back and i had to give them a full run down of my health history while im in pain.  Look forward to the day when that changes.

@_date: 2017-05-13 20:49:11
oh ok, yeah i see it as like a hybrid between what we have now and ancap.
If i could pick i'd choose no money, no capitalism etc, have AI divide the resources or something haha.  Peace
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:51:33
Im a brit, NHS is the  public service IMO, as healthcare is the most important public service.
However healthcare standards aren't always very high IMO, this is perhaps a problem with healthcare in general though not socialist vs private, i have found things to be a lottery, sometimes i have good treatment other times i've had to work whatever random healthcare issue i have out myself which makes little sense since im not trained.  The amount of times i treat myself after becoming my own expert on whatever healthcare issue is bothering me at that time is adding up as years go by. I do start to wonder if they could restructure healthcare somehow. 
I know if i have an accident though the NHS will be there to help me which is nice. 
I dont agree capitalism is on the way out, i think we will see more of anarcho capitalist like society as individuals become responsible for their own lifes. Next war will be one of economics.

@_date: 2017-06-23 11:53:35
But if you hold your coins in core and then move them some time after the fork surely it doesn't matter, they will split into multiple coins the minute you put them into software or exchange that supports multiple chains/coins.   ?

thats what i thought. The OP makes it seem like we should have our coins in electrum wallets.
i have the wallet.dat back up, that can be uploaded into any software i thought?
