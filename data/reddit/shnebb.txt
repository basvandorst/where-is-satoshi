You are filing a return other than a joint return and the total value of your specified foreign assets is more than $200,000 on the last day of the tax year or more than $300,000 at any time during the year; or
You are filing a joint return and the value of your specified foreign asset is more than $400,000 on the last day of the tax year or more than $600,000 at any time during the year.
Admittedly, if you own a house in Sweden and have a decent amount of savings, then you have to file. But most expats are exempt.

This was great. Thank you so much!

Actually, the younger you are, the smarter it is to make risky investments.

Yeah, I signed up a few months back and verification was a piece of cake. But I think they have been a bit overwhlemed with business recently.

Coinbase is the simplest method. Paypal is no good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:34:02
1) I use coinbase and haven't had any problems. I think that's true with most people who use coinbase, just the complaints get upvoted.
2) Coinbase stores your coins at their company. They say 90% are in cold storage. If you want to send money to a different wallet and store the money yourself, that is an option.
3) Localbitcoins works with regular people trading bitcoins. You need to have a wallet set up for this.

I'm in China as well. I was thinking about signing up for btcchina, but I haven't looked into it yet. Have you?

The fact that this has so many upvotes makes me highly suspicious of the average level of education in this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:35:19
1. Set up an account on Coinbase.
2. Transfer coins to Coinbase.
3. Withdraw coins from Coinbase.
4. ~~?????~~ (actually there's no magic here).
5. Profit!

I love how Chinese nationals always try to hurt someone's character by pointing out that they are ABC and not "real Chinese." And they don't even realize that this is something that only Chinese people care about.

Yup. I fit that description. I've known about bitcoin for a long time, but I never knew anyone who had any. When I found out two people I knew had some bitcoin, I decided it was time to take the plunge. Just bought some two weeks ago.

If the price changes over those three seconds, then yes. But it still shows you exactly what you are going to get.

Honestly, it's not on us, it's on the exchanges to change.

You have to sign up for Alipay, which is in Chinese. Also, you need a Chinese bank account.

Are you serious? This is terrible advice. They won't take you seriously no matter how mature you act. They will only respect the voice of another adult. I think going to your parents and getting them to complain is the best option available.

That's what I was suspecting. Thanks.

Since when did BitCoin issue stock?

It's important to know what's being said in MSM, regardless of its level of foolishness.

It's more like one and a half. Also in China they usually refer to it as reminbi or kuai.

30% commison? what? I heard they got rid of their trading fees.

I think the problem isn't that there are no guides, as there are plenty, but there's no support.
There are so many steps involved in putting your coin into cold storage, and it's really easy for something simple to go wrong. For example, I've recently installed linux on a laptop, and I downloaded multibit. But I'm having trouble installing it (probably because I'm a linux noob). I've followed the directions on  But I'm having no success. Who the hell am I supposed to talk to for support for something like that?
I'm not an idiot either. I can take apart and build a computer, do basic website design, etc. I'm trying to learn all there is to know,  but I'm a busy man damnit. 
Maybe we should set up a subreddit just for noob questions like mine. or something similar.
edit: I guess there already is a subreddit, just *no one* in it.

I really want to buy some sriracha bacon lollipops from Lollyphile but I'm in Shanghai and international orders are "coming soon."
Any ideas for products I can buy in China?
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:52:48
I live in Shanghai. I don't think the Chinese government is smart enough to pick up on this yet. Given, I think they will pick up on it before the Western world, but I think it's too early to suspect.
But as my friend said, the Chinese government likes to adapt to something and then regulate it, whereas the Western governments like to regulate something, then adapt to it. So who knows.

I don't think this is a very good analogy, especially in response to the previous comment. Most of the first Europeans to set foot on the shores of the Americas died within a few years. So it was a *high risk high reward* situation. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:58:04
Where's the $1.2 trillion USD from? Is it all the printed money in the US? I don't even understand how that's relevant. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:47:04
Yeah... 
unless you take your fiat and buy the coins beforehand. Then you will have extra money leftover. And a gift. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:47:31
Why did you create a new throwaway account to post this news?
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:43:13
I honestly don't understand. Bitcoin isn't just going to replace cash. Most of the money in the US is electronic.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:05:55
Uh... no. Coinbase locks the exchange rate. You know exactly how much money you are spending as soon as you click BUY. It just takes about a week to complete the transaction process.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:48:02
Well at this rate there should be 433,567 transactions next year, and 27,141,331 Bitpay transactions on Black Friday in 2015.
Soo... yeah.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:20:46
Yeah, I saw coinbase down to $279 for one second.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:16:19
Thanks for your well thought out response. 
I'm a little hesitant on researching this project because I don't really see a strong possibility of something actually happening. But then again, someone has to start doing the research at some point, and I'm sure the PRC already has at least a few people on it right now.
And I like your last point a lot. This would be a perfect way to dive right in to the Chinese financial sector.

OMG! It's soooo simple. Why didn't anyone say this before?
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:10:08
Then comes the question, how much do you really trust coinbase?
I think most users on would tell you to keep your coin in cold storage. But as for myself, I'm holding off on that right now because I'm afraid of making a mistake while I transfer. I'm reading up on it now and will probably transfer most of my btc to cold storage as soon as I feel confident enough not to fuck it up.
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:21:59
Hahaha, that was probably the most brutal ass-whoppin' I've seen in the internet. Bravo. You must have had mandatory internet-military training.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:18:03
Yeah, that makes sense. But just in general, I think it would be too quick for *any* government to be making rash decisions associated with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:50:11
You make a valid point. But if bitcoin is ever to become commonplace, $100B isn't that much money. I doubt it will happen in two years, but it could certainly happen in five.
