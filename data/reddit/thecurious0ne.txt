I wish you all the best!

Most of the stocks on NASDAQ you can buy only there right?
So how do stock exchanges have more competition than crypto exchanges?
@_date: 2018-08-02 09:44:57
Upvote this comment if you think the tumbling fee should be 0.3% like with Wasabi wallet.
Which by the way offers anonymity set of 100.
Actually I don't know what is the anonymity set of Breeze? There is no article clearly explaining those details like there is for Wasabi?
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:03:23
Well don't tattoo your password on your forehead.
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:02:35
That's why I'm researching them.
Taking calculated risks is the way to passively profit from your accumulated wealth. 
oh and I almost forgot, FUCK YOU 
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:07:49


I'm on the side where your mom is
@_date: 2019-03-22 07:31:22
if you've already listened to it, can you summary it for me? :)
Especially the risk management part.
@_date: 2019-03-22 07:30:22
no, im looking for informed opinions.
@_date: 2019-03-23 20:08:24
don't know but they have app on google play
@_date: 2019-03-23 08:51:22
I was kidding :)
@_date: 2019-03-22 07:33:14
That's correct.
There is risk for sure I just don't know if it's bigger or smaller than 6% (the interest rate)
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:56:39
you give BTC and get back BTC and interest in BTC
so the 6% daily swings of BTC value are irrelevant here.
@_date: 2019-03-23 05:04:02
Those 6% are equal to $600k per year though.
@_date: 2019-03-22 07:29:25
so when you invest and profit (free money as you put it) it's always stupid idea?
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:59:11
Interesting. Please ellaborate?
@_date: 2019-03-22 07:29:45
But it has much better interest rate :)
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:53:00
thanks! hugs
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:03:45
Yes, but what if it's actually not a scam? :)
@_date: 2019-11-06 08:41:05
which has the highest availability of offers?
@_date: 2019-03-22 07:31:41
no risk, no gain though
@_date: 2019-11-06 20:47:07
What was the argumentation behind it?
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:55:29
don't be a pussy
@_date: 2019-03-23 08:50:50
Well I'm going to keep them in BTC anyway long term, so why not get an extra 6% btc per year?
@_date: 2019-11-05 21:38:40
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:54:21
so much wrong information in 2 sentences! :)
BlockFi didnt lower the rates because they just announced it.
Nexo doesn't give interest on BTC and ETH YET. It says soon on their site though.
@_date: 2018-10-27 07:33:07
support also dont know
had to create new wallet
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:30:08
Exactly because I expected posts like this I added "Putting aside price appreciation of course." to the end of the OP.
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:00:47
Ok what about the people that invest USD in stocks?
Not in your pocket, not your dollars?
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:30:56
How much you can make from LN?
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:58:29
wow that many? It can be full time job just to spit coins, lol
@_date: 2018-10-19 07:36:42
By big LN node I meant channel with high btc amount.
@_date: 2018-10-11 10:23:04
what's your hourly rate?
@_date: 2018-10-21 19:26:29
i was afraid it's only that
@_date: 2018-10-20 12:18:26
You can lend tokens as well?   
And when they raise they are lended more or how does it work?  
Because I have quite few tokens  
@_date: 2019-11-06 08:40:35
all of those seems to have really low availability of offers still, no?
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:32:57
I guess the only risk is bitfinex going bankrupt or hacked?
@_date: 2018-10-11 06:21:24
yes I understand them
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:34:04
Well they returned peoples money?
@_date: 2018-10-20 12:01:38
what do you need software and hardware wise to support many channels?
@_date: 2018-10-20 12:11:13
can you summary what is needed to run many LN nodes if you've already researched?
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:03:24


















when we can expect those to be ready for production use?
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:05:23
what's the ROI?
@_date: 2018-10-13 10:35:19
How can someone that stupid can have 62k$?
@_date: 2018-10-20 12:10:28
except if there is trustless way to generate passive income on top of bitcoin appreciation itself.
@_date: 2017-01-26 09:02:55
Wow no interest in that at all? I thought it's pretty cool.
@_date: 2018-10-20 12:18:51
that's hilarious 
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:15:25
yes but even if there is no risk at all....0%....
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:05:47
have you researched them?
@_date: 2018-10-25 18:35:49
but if the address had some coin, got dust on top of it, and then you spend only that address alone, you are golden right?
@_date: 2018-10-20 11:58:33
@_date: 2018-10-12 04:29:51
Programmer go at 15 to 25$ per hour (not americans) and VAs are $400 per month. 
So I would have to pass on your offer :)
@_date: 2018-10-11 06:20:50
anything that works on linux though?
@_date: 2018-10-30 21:10:05
do you plan to allow other options other than advcash?
@_date: 2018-10-20 12:12:19
Did you delete your comment above? Why?
@_date: 2019-11-06 08:40:51
Why is that suggested?
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:05:07
how reliable are they?
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:02:17
Nice, thank you.
And can you fund your acc with them with bitcoin directly instead of wiring them fiat?
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:57:37
Looks interesting. Huge counterparty risk though. What do you know for them, like how reliable/established they are?
Also are they US only?
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:32:25
Well this is gambling right?
why joinmarket is 0%?
bitfinex 4% sounds good, but lots of counterparty risk right?
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:03:16
How would one split them then?
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:30:34
last time I checked the returns were insignificant?
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:35:44
Well I dont have 62k so it's ok for me
@_date: 2018-10-24 09:04:41
so this is very fucking good?
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:36:15
since they invented capitalism
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:57:38
but if that dust it sent to an address that already holds bitcoin and you just send all from that input at once, there is advantage to them right?
@_date: 2019-11-05 21:38:34
I don't have the experience to setup that, im looking for a service.
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:58:11
trustless is greatly preferred
however I might put small amounts in custodial as well if the company is established enough
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:01:43
Does this Ben has any credibility? It kinda looks like an idiot and I'm hesitant to trust idiots.
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:14:55
what about big LN node? :)
@_date: 2018-10-18 09:18:49
even bank wires can be reversed nowadays unfortunately
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:19:36
my bad, that was for via btc
@_date: 2018-10-11 06:27:00
I was hoping for that actually since I'm kinda busy :)
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:15:54
better than just taking a haircut right?
@_date: 2018-10-20 11:33:57
looks good actually, i will give it  a try
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:03:39
They seem to require ID verification to deposit BCC though. Any idea how long that usually takes?
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:26:32
And in more words?
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:53:00
Is it true they will be buying real bitcoins or im getting it wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:44:45
Thank you.
One last thing, can you make fiat wires out?
@_date: 2018-10-20 12:08:41
genius, lol
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:35:28
good question, that could be huge
@_date: 2018-10-20 12:05:19
Please get back to us if you find anything interesting
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:32:18
But can you withdraw before the verification ended?
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:19:59

@_date: 2018-10-18 04:20:56
bisq seems great but part of decentralization is to have more than 1 decentralized product :)
By the way, if you are using bisq, how is luqidity, users, payment options?
@_date: 2019-02-22 09:24:18
To me as well, if it wasn't for the high profile CEO I would never have considered it.
@_date: 2019-02-19 16:01:39
So that explains the bull run?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:48:05
That is great, but when you are crowd invested it's kinda nice to keep the community updated outside of github. Not everyone is a programmer. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:23:18
What is going on with that project?
I haven't heard from them since the ICO
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:24:07
I've been a milionare for a while now
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:39:14
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:38:58
He was the man behind segwit2x as well right?
so he is at the same time pro segwit and pro bitcoin cash? Or im mistaken.
he also also the one that said mtgox is fine?
Mark Karpeles is also in Japan, the other bitcoin vilan.
Maybe they suck each other's cocks too?
@_date: 2017-04-24 09:47:41
Yes loads today. Slow but loads.
@_date: 2019-04-01 04:59:54
yup, i deposited already :)
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:36:41
You couldn't have made worse picture even if you tried.
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:57:14
can you give more details on how does this work&gt;
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:30:29
wow so it started 4 days ago and no positive effect on the price... :(
@_date: 2018-11-07 20:39:03
do they freeze accounts often?
@_date: 2018-11-13 08:57:44
I was mostly interested in the limits on the Fidor site
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:42:12
what is Hodl Hodl?
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:46:32
Well check and lmk when you are sure. Please :)
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:11:10
They go for $1-2 on aliexpress
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:39:44
much VROOM VROOOOM
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:50:28
they also enable "hidden destinations"?
How does this work? Do we finally have privacy?
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:00:38
what about their card? Any fees for non-eur transactions?
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:42:03
hm weird I havent heard about them, I guess they are new and not used much yet?
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:26:17
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:46:10
Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop Poop 
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:27:03
you sure?
@_date: 2018-11-09 11:11:23
What are the limits and are there cases of freezing account until theck check source of funds?
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:49:41
Those devs need vacation.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:34:33
last week they said next week, but not when next week
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:06:38
That's what I did :)
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:30:01
A lot of morons there. I asked them which offshore destination is best for 0% tax on foreign income and they told me that is impossible. lol
@_date: 2018-07-19 03:00:02
Are there already consumer wallets that support LN payments?
@_date: 2018-07-17 05:15:53
So what stops anyone from running 100 nodes on his local machine?
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:21:21
What would be a good place to learn the basics?
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:15:51
Do you have dedicated sub-reddit to Wasabi?
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:04:51
can you open multiple channels with one node?
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:19:31
I see.
Is there site with stats about it, channels, tx and so on?
Where one can learn how to do it?
What prevents someone from opening 1000 channels and dominating the network?
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:30:31
nah, dat ugly
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:22:17
Waiting :)
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:20:37
A lot of people are masturbating on the price, but only few admit it!
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:28:02
come on man, i was counting on you!
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:37:06
Why bro?
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:00:05
Or set a timer?
@_date: 2019-05-28 10:59:22










only US or?
Coinbase card is only UK for now.
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:45:26
Is naga legit? They seem to have a lot of stuff going on but nobody talks about them? Why?
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:57:29
How does it work behind the scenes and what is the fee?
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:50:43
well im using blockchain.info
would that work?
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:12:00
hodl my beer, while I hodl
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:44:18
yeah me too
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:07:02
And my fist should fit into his ass, not change it.
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:45:05
Are they legit though?
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:44:01
I used child pays for parent with a fee of about $7
it went confirmed just minutes after that transaction :)
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:49:28
well i paid the blockchain.info recommended fee for 1+ hour confirmation and it is still not confirmed.
I've managed better in much more competitive days, so really wondering why this now
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:19:43
nope, just did another transaction on blockchain.info using the change output of the previous one with higher fee. Paid it to myself again. 
So the miners have iniciative, since to get the high fee of the second one they have to mine the first one.
Beautiful workaround :)
