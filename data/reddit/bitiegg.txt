@_date: 2017-12-17 03:43:55
Ignore the immature assholes here. Coinbase will let you know when they've transferred your BTC into your account. Once you see the BTC balance, you may do whatever you wish with the coin, as well as sell it.
Edit (adding more info): If you're going to be selling coins for sure, I'd transfer the coins 6 hours before you want to make your transaction as it takes time during busy hours.

People seem to have a hard time to believe this is an adoption curve rather than looking at it like stocks. For example look at cellphones. Everyone wanted the technology. The trend is going parabolic... Don't fud yourself. Believe in the tech and try to see it from an adoption curve perspective. Google it if you don't understand what it is. Also parabolictrav on Twitter breaks this down well. Check em out.

Depends on where you wallet is. If it's on your computer, they can hack it. Same thing with Cellphone. If you have a cold storage, highly not likely, unless they find your seed keys.

@_date: 2017-12-10 05:05:43
I certainly hope so. All these people saying we need a correction isn't saying it to FUD. The faster the correction comes, the faster we can move up without fearing a whale is going to dump their bitcoins for profit. So yeah, for the sake of stability in bitcoin I hope we take a healthy correction before the whole wallstreet era comes in.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:05:16
Lol bro... If you're that insecure about it, just sell it. Don't know why you're just hanging on to it with your dear life when you have all this fear. I'm confident and happy with my long term investment. Obviously you're not so get out before all your fears come true.

@_date: 2017-12-08 20:59:52
I think it's known that economy drops during war. Their banks and other financial institutions who hold that money would be vulnerable to attack. If you have money on bitcoin though, you could easily move to another country with all your money and start again rather than waiting for banks to transfer all your money. This is just my own logical opinion though so take it with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:39:02

You choose to close the transaction whenever you want. Andreas speaks as well on it. He closes it by watching the transaction traffic and closes it.

Can't we learn not to do business with these guys? They're completely out of control with this mess... over and over... how much are you going to cover for these guys?
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:46:19
If you can invest little by little you should do so. It's never too late to start investing. Take a small portion of your pay and buy some and keep collecting that way. I read on Reddit that a student bought $50 every month. He now has 10 bitcoins. It's more expensive now but it's not too late. Price predicts are $100k+ end of 2018. If you start saving now, you will make some money as well. Good luck!

I've been watching these guys go up to bat for Bitcoin. They're very positive and we'll spoken about it. They haven't done anything shady neither and they follow the old books. Low fees and you can buy 500 instant when you deposit without having to wait. I will be using these guys only now. Really sucks what Coinbase did today.... Winklevoss guys are solid and I'm glad they're here.

@_date: 2017-12-28 08:17:11
North Korea and China traders probably still use Korean exchanges. Also Korean exchanges allow trading without penalty or fees which lures in a lot of traders. This drop probably happened because people who won't be allowed to trade in Korea anymore are bailing out as fast as they can. This is actually very good for Bitcoin. Harder for people to manipulate bitcoin.

This was really awesome to watch thanks! I like how Mitch points out the US dollar is a ponzi scheme and everything in the US is way overpriced now. I do like the point that Futures are initially going to come in and short btc at the price now. These people are here to make money and not invest in tech. Seems realistic. They all seem to be excited though about the technology behind it and how innovating this is to driven more entrepeures forward even though there are scams out there. Good post!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:17:12

Let me explain why people are being negative toward your action. You say he's your grandfather who's probably old. The older you get, the less risk you want to take in your investments. Reason is that they need that money to survive since that's the income. You might be young enough to wait out a horrific crash. Crashes always recover within 5 to 6 years... Your grandfather might not have that much time before needing that money to buy food, ultility bills... Crypto currently is still a very risky bet, and that's something older people like your grandfather who needs that money to survive shouldn't invest that heavily into it. If it crashes tomorrow, he's going to be in a very bad position.

Family and friends warning you is fine and I get that they are doing it because they care. The problem is that people, family or not, tell you things without even trying to understand what you're getting into. All they see is the media and parrot whatever they saw. Also of you listen to your family members and sell... Then end up it being really really wrong, you will start resenting them. I get that they care and it's fine. I just wish they try to hear your side of the argument is all, because why do you tell them.avout it? Same reason why they tell you to sell... So you can help them out as well.

I was thinking about this as well but the way Bitcoin held on so tight at 5800 range on the second hit, I have faith that a tonnnn of people are going to be buying tomorrow. Hence I just paid the Coinbase fee and bought now. I'm veryyyy comfortable with 6300 price tag and no regratzzz!! Tomorrow will be very interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:37:24
Transfer time depends. Sometimes it's fast and sometimes it's slow like couple hours. I believe it's free because you do all the work yourself, not coinbase.

My wife was hesitant at first but she's been seeing the results lately. She now wants to buy more Bitcoins and whenever we see expensive things, she goes "Bitcoin!! Let's go up!"

Good stuff! Will this be free? In app purchase? Or just straight up pay once?

I usually just buy and get it over with. Some people like to buy half then the other half later. Whatever helps you sleep at night. These differences won't matter when we hit 15k+

Dude... chill man. New comers are what's going to keep driving the price up. If they want to celebrate because they've invested money into bitcoin, let them celebrate. It's all part of the excitement and that positive vibe spreads out to other potential investors and get then to invest as well. As annoying as it may be, it provides excitement and celebration which is great to offset the trolls we have coming in here.

I use Coinbase. They were super accessible for me as a new comer. Haven't had issues with them.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:35:08
People have bad experiences with Coin base here apparently. Also Coin base can just sit on your forked coins for however long they want. I heard people still didn't get their bit coin gold or cash from coinbase.

All this trashing of Coinbase... I understand people have problems with their stance at times. That's fine, but Coinbase is the gateway for US and EU newcomers to get into crypto currency. I did and all the newcomers that will join will use Coinbase. When my friends ask, I say Coinbase. Without new people being able to buy into bitcoin as easy as Coinbase provides it to be, we'll just be an echo chamber. Stop it... Coinbase has their stance as a company but the giant gate they provide for new comers is more valuable for bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:04:42

@_date: 2017-11-26 20:09:41
If your bank gets robbed and is not backed by government FDIC, you basically lost all your money and can't do anything about it. Bitcoins are not insured by Coinbase or any other exchanges for that matter so you have absolutely zero protection on recovering if something happens to Coinbase. I think it's fine to leave some in Coinbase but majority of it should be in your own safe place.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:54:07

@_date: 2017-11-02 07:38:16
My damn problem is that my money goes through Coinbase when bitcoins are hitting ATH... EVERY DAMN TIME... and you know what? I buy at ATH, EVERY DAMN TIME. I've learned not to test Bitcoin's dip.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:27:59
Coinbase is the only place you can "Lock in" the price at that time. That's why they charge you premiums. If the price skyrockets, like it is now, you're still locked in at that price. So if you wanna lock in, pay the premium. If you don't, you can wire money and pay the fee for that and buy, OR you can just transfer fiat which takes a week.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:01:09
If you want S2X coin soon as possible, you should take it offline. If you don't care, you can leave it in Coinbase, and if S2X becomes popular enough, they'll distribute then. I believe this is the same thing that happened with Bitcoin Gold.

Get a physical wallet like Ledger / Trezor. Transfer bitcoins in there. Hold on to them in there and let Ledger/Trezor spread out the fork coin. Let few days pass. Do whatever you want.

@_date: 2017-11-18 17:24:16
I think right now is the last 7k dip you'll see. Thing I've learned is that you never test bitcoin's price. Don't try to time the market... you're gonna have a bad time like you did before.
Here are some reasons to buy now. Before Bitcoin's ATMs kick in... Before CME Wallstreet comes in... Before Square payment customers come in...
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:03:50
Yeah I feel like a lot of people I talk to get discouraged to join in because they think "it's too expensive now"... I like the idea of breaking it down more so people aren't ad intimidated.

Relax guys, we're overdue for a proper correction and it seems we're going to get it. THIS IS A GOOD THING. We can not keep going up at these rates forever. Prepare to be hit in 5k to 7k range if the 9k breaks. After the correction I believe we're going to skyrocket back up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:30:15
exactly what I wanted to ask for. Thanks!

I was super nervous at first too and triple checked everything. Coinbase made it easy enough. Now I can use GDax pretty well. Now I'm addicted to it.... it's dangerous. I would highly recommend you get a cold storage like ledger or trezor and keep all your coins there 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:52:21
"What's different about these coins than other commodities ... there is no supply response here," Novogratz said. "So it's a speculator's dream in that as buying happens there's no new supply response that comes up. So every price move gets exaggerated. It's going to get exaggerated on the way up. There will be 50 percent corrections. It will get exaggerated on the way down."
50% discount... my body is ready!

@_date: 2017-11-29 16:21:21
So right now there's this thing called Tether. There's a big posiblility that it's printing fake money. You can find all this on youtube. This unaccounted for money is coming into bitcoin trading in millions... once government cracks down on exchanges that use this, they will all shutdown since it's highly illegal. That's one big issue.
Second issue is that this price surge needs a really good correction to bounce off of for it to be stable. It needs to drop hard for the price to bounce off of. People are expecting 30 to 50% drop for a good correction. When that is I have no idea... but I hope it happens sooner than later because it could get ugly. I'm just loading up on coin base for when it happens.

First is the usd in the exchange yet like coinbase or gemini? If not make that move first as it takes over a week to transfer money into it. After that, you know as much as everyone else about the future. Some people think price will go down after the fork. Some people think it's going to rise. No one has the answer. It's your choice to buy now or wait it out. Both are risky. You gotta be the one to take it because you can't blame anyone else after you jump.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:25:09
It's not FUD... we need a proper correction by now to bounce off from.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:08:32

I own tech stock as well and have been invested all in tech for awhile. I made decent change out of it so now I'm diversifying. Bitcoin sounds amazing still and the hype is at the peak right now. I would take all your portfolio in stocks break it down to percentages and cover all angles while still being aggrssive. For me, I'm thinking about 10-15% of my portfolio be crypto. The fun thing about crypto investment like Bitcoin is that you can take the money earned, and spend some on alt coins. The just build your portfolio up more with the Bitcoin gains. That's just approach I'm taking.

Zoom out and look at the China scare... look at the bch attacks... at those times people, including me clenched our buttcheeks and now sitting at almost 10k. Lot of people made mistakes of selling and losing but lot of others hodl and are happy to have almost sold but didnt. When it hits low, buy because bit coin has the reputation to come back with vengeance. Look at the graph... that's history... and history ....
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:20:19
I think only slight turbulence for 10k. When it hits 100k however, we'll see a way bigger turbulence there imo.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:40:50

@_date: 2017-11-26 18:20:17
If you don't mind the fees, which I'm sure you do, then buy off coinbase. The GDAX step eliminates you from paying fees and is completely free along with the transfer to your cold storage from GDAX while Coinbase charges you the btc transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:08:59
It takes about 5-7 business days... It takes awhile for it to get transferred. I wouldn't worry until the 7th business day. Happens to me all the time.

It makes sense for Square to get in this space though since they're about transactions. I bought their stocks immidiately following the news and got a nice bump next day.

You bought in when everyone is in panic and fear. Good job! You bought the dip! Continue to do this over and over again, you'll accumulate faster than you think. Lots of great devs to follow on Twitter for fundamental updates and news. YouTube has great people as well. First one I would follow and watch is Andreas. You will see that people get VERY dramatic in price. Don't let that get to you. How? Focus on the fundamentals. You'll be fine. Welcome to Bitcoin! King will rise again and again!

Robinhood doesn't even need to hold any coins lol... They're basically the middle man for you and Gemini/Coinbase. Why not then just purchase from a proper exchange where you can withdraw and deposit?
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:31:45
I'd rather listen to entrepreneurs who are putting their own money and efforts to bring Bitcoin to the masses than a guy who sold his house to become rich one day. Stop it with your comment... You sound crazy.

I'm also withdrawing to my wallet right now and it's taking a bit. 
their systems are taking a hit right now it seems. I'd just wait.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:42:13
Lol... I had the exact same question the other day. I actually said I don't know and it went with legacy by default. Then I had to transfer those to segwit within my ledger nano which made me pay a transaction fee. Thank god I was testing it with $50. Good on you for getting a cold wallet friend!

"If you're going to hodl for a long time..." buying in at 5800 vs 5500 doesn't matter when you're wanting big gains in the coming years. I tried to time the market when it was at 3500 waiting for it to go 3000. It shot up to 4500 and never saw 3000 again. As my friend said, "don't try to time the market".

Safest way to HOLD bitcoin is through things like ledger and you keeping it safe. Other wallets and exchanges could be hacked and you won't be able to do anything about it.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:23:06
Nope! They don't let you withdraw at all. It's all on their third party exchange
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:05:47
Got emmmm
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:32:26
Completely agree
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:18:54
Was hyped until I found out you can't withdraw the bitcoins you bought... What??? That makes Robinhood worthless to me.
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:41:22
Alright... Enough of your trolling. Go somewhere else...
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:22:52
This! Don't transfer a large sum of btc at once. Learn the process with a small amount first before doing so. There's so many posts of people making mistakes on this forum. I'd definitely get multiple cold storages too and spread them out. Good luck my friend! I'll be thinking of you when it hits 10k! Lol.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:07:06
Quick tip. This is what I learned to do. Transfer cash into coinbase &gt; transfer that money into GDAX(instant) &gt; buy with limit option (YouTube this if you're confused. It's super easy) &gt; there's no fees to buy &gt; after you purchased your btc or whatever &gt; withdrawal to your wallet or ledger or trezor without fees. Using Coinbase is good if you want to buy it at that price, which my friend did at 3600 and it's never gone down that low since. If you can wait about a week for your cash to transfer, then there are no fees. You have both options to purchase the way you want and I really like that about coinbase.

Thanks for your reply! You had some great points. It sounds like everyone is saying similar things. Keep your coins yourself and don't let exchanges have control over your money. This is very interesting... with the massive amounts of new comers buying into bitcoin, it's engraved in our brains to keep our money in banks. Now we have to rewire our brain to keep it ourselves. Wonder if bitcoin educate the masses on this concept. I get it now you guys explained it but the people who aren't really questioning these things will never understand it.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:44:54
Is there a reason why you can't use exchanges like coinbase/gemini
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:09:22
I can't wait for the day I change my bank, which I will here soon, and they ask "Why are you leaving us after all these years?". I'll reply "Because your CEO said some dumb shit about Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:58:36
Safest way to store your but coin would be through hardware like ledger nano or trezor. I just did this for myself after reading about it.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:26:14
I'm always curious which banks are doing things like this... could you say? I feel like we need to keep a big log of banks that are against bitcoins and have people rethink their bank options.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:52:43
Ah... I see... there should be something equivalent to coin base in Canada though right?
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:26:49
This! I feel like once the uncertainty goes away, no more sale prices. I tried timing the market and it didn't work out well. Better to just buy now and relax.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:44:49
Yeah I'm with one of the bigger banks and have had no problems.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:02:14
All their customers are required to go through these steps. I'm sure they want to prevent scams and what not as much as possible. I transfer money to it without problems since my bank doesn't really interfere. It just takes 4 to 5 days.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:48:55
This is my plan as well with my investment. Invest in this amazing tech and then buy a house for my family in the future with the actual BTC. I have a feeling you'll see a ton of people buying houses with it in the near future.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:52:21
I think this is the natural first response from a lot of new comers and I'm one of them as well. The hook to getting the masses to pay attention to bitcoin is the $$$. Without it you wouldn't be getting as much of the masses paying attention to it. Honestly what got me interested was of the crazy profit stories which reminded me of this being a thing long ago. So I naturally start looking up ways to purchase some while briefly looking in depth of bitcoin. The point of where I became a believer in bitcoin tech was AFTER I bought some. I in it now so I have to pay attention. I join this subreddit and others. I look up bitcoin news more frequently. I try to learn more about the forks which educated me to get a Ledger. So yeah... sure people run to buy them first but once they're in, they'll educate themselves naturally. At least that's how I'm getting into it. Now I talk about it a lot with my coworkers and they get interested. The more people buy the stronger the bitcoin. I think it's a good thing.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:10:00
I think I'm learning that any exchanges like coinbase, gemini(heard this is a great exchange too), etc... they're all not a great place to keep your bitcoins due to vulnerability of bitcoins getting stolen. Safest way is to have them with you on a ledger nano or trezor or any other physical hardware methods you can keep safely.
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:44:18
Hodlers are pigs... Obivously got slaughtered already. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:52:35
Easiest way if they don't care about fees is Coinbase. Sign up for an account and buy. If they're that wealthy, I'm sure they wouldn't mind paying the fee for convinience. After their transaction goes through, put then in physical cold wallets like trezor or ledgernano.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:33:23
I bought @ 6k. Do what you want with your money man. Fork will happen but no one really knows the final outcome.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:41:15
Think their systems are getting hammered. 
I'm transferring a small amount of bitcoin to my ledger wallet and it's taking awhile. Just hold tight and let the systems get unclogged. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:58:01
All these ATM owners need to figure out a way to bring down their bullshit fees. Every time I see these now I don't ever wanna go near them. I can get btc easily with my phone without the insane fees. If you can't bring prices down to reasonable levels, I will continue to see it as a scam and continue to tell people it's a scam.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:36:50
Okay now you have a Coinbase account, pay NO FEES!
This is how I learned to use GDAX so I now pay 0 fees for buying bitcoin. A bit more work but super easy.
I'd definitely invest in a Ledger Nano S or Trezor to store your bitcoins after. They're pricey but worth it if you're going to hold on to your own bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:06:55
It makes Robinhood just a Fiat exchange where you trade imaginary bitcoins and eth.
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:18:49
Retail stock investors will need solid reason to invest into Bitcoin while the stocks plunge. That reason is a massive bullrun from btc while the stocks are dropping. Hopefully we can get that happening.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:09:55
If you're going to hodl for a long time, it really doesn't matter too much in terms of this month or next. Try buying a percentage of that now and see how you feel. Warning though... it gets very addicting.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:09:11
Then for now I would just transfer to a wallet and leave it there til you receive it. I know it's frightening but it's not as complicating as it sounds.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:26:34
Best to specify the country you're in. In the US, Coinbase and Gemini seems to be the most popular. Know that you can't just dump 100k right away... at least that's my experience with Coinbase. You have to hit milestones like... invest 3k first...then you can invest 5k...then 10k. If you want to save on fees, it takes time for cash to get into the exchange. So first thing I would do is check with your bank to make sure they don't have issues with bitcoin investments since there's been issues with banks closing accounts and what not. Then slowly put money in and buy more and more as time goes by.
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:51:36
