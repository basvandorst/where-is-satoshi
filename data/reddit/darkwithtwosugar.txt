Does he have tens of billions of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:14:32
This but unironically
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:01:49
No one is considering he sold it in case the reaction to the change yanked the price
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:50
What about it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:43:33
He dumped it all right before making a big change...
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:17:54
Yes, and we all know about those bitcoins and how much they’re worth. 
These people were saying he could have some unknown number of bitcoins, like billions, just stored away that we don’t know about.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:57
I know and it’s pissing me off because the price is dropping fast
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:21:22
Can I ask why you don’t like bch? I’m pretty new to bitcoin and cryptos but i see this huge divide between you guys and r/btc 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:32:35
That doesn’t make sense though. If he’s trying to improve this thing he’s in charge of, he’s not doing anything wrong. Maybe if he bought a bunch before the price rose it would be insider knowledge abuse, but that’s not what was happening
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:08:19
If you don’t think bankers are actively trying to manipulate bitcoin’a value and influence, you belong in r/naive

We have to pay 30x more than needed because your country won’t.

Banks are buying and selling to crash it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:58
HURR durr
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:08:41
Shh this sub doesn’t allow common sense
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:28:09
“Illegal explosives”?
Fireworks. The guy sold fireworks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:06:12
I asked you if he has tens of billlions. Which he doesn’t. And the bitcoins he does have, we know about. 
Because that’s how it WORKS. And that’s what I’m telling you.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:37:48
Why are Willy Wonka memes so relevant to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:21:46
Common sense :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:50:55
No no no, the banks have probably been buying since the 5,000s. That’s when price really started rising. When it became popular, that’s the pump and dump. Normal people wanting to get in and get out while it’s high.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:55:10
.. that’s exactly my point. They don’t know how it works yet theyre on TV making pretty big claims about it. How is that not being an idiot?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:40:32
They’re trying to break peoples confidence in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:25:48
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:36
It’s going to drop again though, it’s in a bear trap right now 
Edit: I’m going to lose any profit I would have made because CB isn’t letting me use my money. Never using it again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:46:44
That isn’t how a bubble works though. For a month the price has slowly been growing and growing and growing, and now they’re selling it all at once. That gives the btc a curve that perfectly resembles a bubble crash. 
The media and public hype is a part of that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:27:29
Whatever all the people who’ve had bitcoin since the $200 days tell me to use
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:24:25
My friend was telling me about how Fox Money told him that 
“Whoever creates bitcoin could just have billions stored away that we don’t know about, and sell it all when it’s really high to make money and ruin everyone’s investments” 
Fucking idiots.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:31:12
Just have to wait and see. Once all this blows over and I’ve lost my money, people will start discussions about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:34:23
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:36
Yeah great dude. I make a new account every couple months so I don’t get doxxed.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:59:49
Makes me kind of sad i never tried acting. I really have a nack for this as wel :/
