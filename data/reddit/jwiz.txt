What makes you think I would want that?
@_date: 2011-07-09 23:26:06
I would not consider them (gold, bitcoins) fiat, and so I do not agree with the "not having intrinsic value" criterion for fiat-ness
To me, for something to be by fiat, there must be someone issuing the fiat.
@_date: 2011-06-17 03:28:51
I suspect you are on the right track in your thinking here.
@_date: 2011-06-04 21:00:31
I opened a new checking account for the sole purpose of linking with dwolla because I'd never heard of them (wtf...Des Moines?).
I'm still waiting to verify the account, though.
@_date: 2011-06-25 03:16:13
The point is that some goldbugs like to say "gold has real value", when that's just not true.  It's not the intrinsic value that causes people to trade $1500/oz for it.
It's because gold is traditionally used as a currency, and people are confident that it will continue to be used as one.
In other words, it's only "valuable" because people think it is/will-be valuable.
@_date: 2011-07-08 20:34:22
Gold is not traded for as many dollars as it is because of its electrical properties. It is because of gold's usage as money that it is traded for as many dollars as it is.
"easy to transfer value store" is only of value *when used as money*. That just leads in circles.

Citation needed?
Seriously, this is an interesting origin, and I would be interested in more detail.
@_date: 2011-07-09 22:59:02
Sorry if I was unclear.  I think neither gold nor bitcoins have *intrinsic* value, but both have qualities that make them useful as money/currency.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:59:12
Argh, I just discovered that I also did not use a throwaway.  I have no idea why, really.
@_date: 2011-06-25 01:56:37
Yes, obviously there *are* modern industrial uses for gold.  [That's only about 11% of the demand, though.](
Gold was considered valuable before there was an electronics industry.  Industrial usage/demand is not a significant factor in the dollar price of gold.

What I like to do is use legal tender for my debts, because they have to take it (by definition).
@_date: 2011-06-13 17:43:14
And...they're gone.
Thanks for the heads up.  I managed to get one.
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:35:30
I'm conjecturing that no one ever *did* have access to any real BTC, only mtgox-trading-database representations of them.
@_date: 2011-06-28 04:47:27
It would, you'd just need a bigger table, no?
@_date: 2011-06-23 03:26:25
I don't think they were "stolen" coins when Kevin bought them.  I think mtgox itself was hacked, and coins were made from thin air and credited to someone's account.
That account then dumped these imaginary coins onto the market in an effort to push the price down and thereby increase the number of imaginary coins they could make real by withdrawing them (limited to $1000 daily).
Kevin didn't buy someone else's coins.  They were fake.  Mtgox can't "let him keep them" because they never existed.
@_date: 2011-06-21 07:36:51


"They said so." is hardly compelling when they have every reason to cover something like this up.


That is exactly my point.  There is no need for an account to be compromised to provide bitcoins with which to fill the bids.  They can simply be filled, without any accounts providing them.  Because all these "transactions" are within the confines of the exchange itself, there needn't be any *real* bitcoins until people cash out.
Nothing in your post actually addresses the main point of my post, which was: "what proof do we have that any account was compromised?"
@_date: 2011-06-29 03:20:37
Is it 16?  For some reason I was thinking it was only like 12 bits or so.
*checks wikipedia*
Ah, it's the unix salts that are 12bits.  Yeah, 128bit salts are pretty big. :)
@_date: 2011-07-08 19:19:51
The third bullet of the definitions just says "money without intrinsic value". By that definition, it is fiat.  I disagree, but there is certainly room for argument.
I think "fiat" should only include things that have been declared to have value by someone with power to enforce it, not things that people agree to consider money though they have no intrinsic value (like bit coins or gold).
@_date: 2011-06-21 19:59:22
Why would someone have that many coins effectively at the mercy of mtgox's security (or lack thereof).
There's no reason to park them all there, since it's very fast to move them in on demand.
@_date: 2011-06-13 03:01:09
Dictionaries don't *prove* what terms mean, they are tools to show what people meant when they said the term.
Wikipedia's first sentence is "Fiat money is money that has value only because of government regulation or law" (which puts the emphasis on the "fiat" part of the phrase).
However, later in the article, they say it can be defined as "money without intrinsic value.", but they cite [this]( which appears to be specifically in the context of "money without intrinsic value" that is used due to governmental decree.
I tend to be in the "fiat" camp (i.e., the literal meaning of the word "fiat"), rather than the "no intrinsic value camp".
I think a lot of historical references you'll find are due to there not really being prior examples of "money without intrisic value" that people actually used *without there also being a decree (fiat)*.  So it was kind of assumed that there'd be a fiat.
Gold is arguably without intrinsic value (yes, there are nominal industrial uses, but only like 11% of the gold is used industrially), and yet people would not call it "fiat".

The bitcoin wiki chart shows the 5770 as close to 2 MH/J. The 5830 is around 1.5. That is not "making up for it". 
@_date: 2011-06-12 05:42:58
Err, can you quote the bit that makes you think that?
I was trying to find out whether the time I spent *before* being notified (by the long poll) was time that was wasted, or not.  Basically, I was trying to clarify my mental model of what is going on in the mining (and I suppose I could just try reading the original paper).
[Wildwichtel clarified things for me.](
@_date: 2011-06-11 18:45:40
Ok, that clarifies things for me.  Thanks.
@_date: 2011-06-16 02:01:35
[Sort this table by Mhash/J](
Also, the 5770 is still pretty available.
@_date: 2011-06-24 04:39:23
I love how they say that gold has "real value".
The entire point of gold is that it's not actually good for much (besides looking pretty).  That's what makes it a good currency.
@_date: 2011-06-18 17:22:41
They make about $6000/day in fees, at the current volume and exchange rate.
    0.0065 * 60461 * 15 = 5894.9475
@_date: 2011-07-09 21:08:15
Yes. That is exactly my point. Maybe we are just talking past each other.
I am saying that "having monetarily useful properties" is not the same thing as "having intrinsic value".
Gold and bit coins both have no/nominal intrinsic value, but have many properties that make them useful as money.
@_date: 2011-06-29 05:55:24
Well, I had 12 bits in my head, and that isn't actually that much salt nowadays.  My original point is totally valid/viable for only 12 bits of salt.
@_date: 2011-06-20 06:13:44
Just get the 5770s.  They are more power efficient anyway, which is what you come down to, long term.
@_date: 2011-06-22 20:26:20
Yes, but *after that mail*, have you heard anything?
I think everybody has gotten that mail, but nothing since.
@_date: 2011-06-04 23:41:02
Hopes: dashed.
@_date: 2011-06-25 03:52:49
Well, no.
Food has value because you can eat it.
Shelter has value because it protects you from the elements.
Land has value because you can grow food, or build shelter on it.
Another, perhaps better, word for "value" in these cases would be "utility".
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:24:56
How do you know that?  There clearly were sql injection vulnerabilities (per the IRC logs that are floating around).
It's a lot more plausible to me than that some crazy person had half a million BTC at mtgox (why would they put them all at mtgox, instead of transferring them in when needed to keep up with the $1000/day limit).
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:29:03


That sounds farfetched.  There's no reason to park hundreds of thousands of bitcoins at mtgox.  You can only take out $1000 per day anyway, and it's instantly fast to add more BTC to your account should you ever wish to sell more.


Yes, but I'm proposing that the "ton of coins" did not actually come from anywhere but a database/site hack.
I think mtgox *has* to rollback because they don't have the BTC available to let people cash out.
@_date: 2011-06-18 17:30:59
Oh, indeed.
I think a lot of folks haven't really considered the vast amount of money that mtgox is raking in when they leap to their defense.
There's a huge margin...if they don't actually spend any of that revenue on securing the site.
@_date: 2011-06-22 05:31:06
Exactly.  I postulated along these lines in [this reddit self-post](
@_date: 2011-06-08 06:53:11
So that's about $2700 a day.
How much does mtgox.com make on the 0.65% of all transactions on the exchange?
    $ dc
    76821 26.7 .0065 * * p
    13328.4435
$13328 a day.
Sure, the 50% of network thing could be sketchy, but the $112 an hour is...meh?
@_date: 2011-06-05 02:32:24
So you are saying that I have:
* ~3 days til I can verify the dwolla account
* 7 days from my bank ... to dwolla?
* some (?) days from dwolla to mtgox?
@_date: 2011-06-21 01:15:23
I don't understand why they claim that the guy (Kevin) having been logged in for 3 minutes before the selling ensues someone indicates that he knew beforehand.
@_date: 2011-06-22 04:09:28
This (a vulnerability being used to create bitcoins, vs an idiot with 500000 BTC in mtgox) is very plausible to me.
@_date: 2011-06-11 18:13:52
Well, if I was working on a block, and spent, say, a minute on it...and then the server pushed out that someone else had found the block, then I *did* waste that minute, no?
That is (as stated in my original post), I understand that the long polling has enabled me to avoid wasting as much time *as possible*, but I suspect that I am still wasting time (and wanted someone to confirm/deny that).
@_date: 2011-06-04 21:53:18
Like 4 hours. :)  But it *seems* like longer!
Hopefully I will be able to get verified before bitcoins cost $50 each. :(
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:30:06
To clarify my post, I was giving those two reasons as examples of the ones I have heard, so that I could contrast them with my own theory (that someone created BTC out of thin air by exploiting mtgox database/site).
@_date: 2011-06-17 02:06:54
I really think antivirus is worse than none, because it makes people falsely secure.
@_date: 2011-07-09 21:15:30
I don't think it is appropriate to consider attributes/qualities that are desirable in a currency to be an "intrinsic value" of the currency.
An intrinsic value would be utility outside of its function as currency. Like the ability of the cow to make milk, or be eaten.
Otherwise you'd have to say that gold has intrinsic value because it is somewhat rare and is easily shaped/divided (both good qualities for a currency).
