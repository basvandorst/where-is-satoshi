However, it is likely bitcoin will see adoption where transaction costs are highest and access to financial services is lowest- emerging markets. Most of these markets get regulator "clues" from mature markets and regulate accordingly. If this is the case for bitcoin, we are going to see it gain traction before these guys know what to do. Unlike mature markets where regulators (somewhat) listen to large tech companies and academia, may emerging markets will regulate in fear as they see that their citizens now have the ability to avoid the high inflation associated with the national currency they offer.

Switzerland doesn't want to lose its precious financial sector. Regulators and legacy financial institutions are taking note and will hopefully continue with such positive news!

So it's only 100k at the moment. What happens when they issue a more reasonable amount to meet demand? If,  for example, 5 billion euro is issued, will the incentive for a 51% attack be increased because the value secured on the network (colored coins)  exceed the value of bitcoins in circulation?

DFJ back D-Wave. D= Draper. Draper bought $19 million in btc from the silk road auction, and his son runs boost vc (a btc and VR venture capital fund. I believe they would protect their investment, and not build a D-Wave computer that would even target hashed base crypto.

This has just happened to me as well, except a lot less.  After 10 years as a regular buyer and casual seller, some idiot says I didn't ship an item, and the balance is removed from my account.

@_date: 2015-01-27 06:17:45
from what i understand, somebody must buy bitcoin to then send to kenya (then being converted to shillings and distributed to the end customer). What if the price fluctuates 10% from the time the btc is bought? Does the average remittance sender from the UK understand and have trust in bitcoin enough to buy it?

Yes, but as we saw with Obama, you can't simply change foreign policy. It is inherited from the previous administration. Sanders will most likely inherit both foreign policy and a recessionary market that will be dealt with via by Keynesian economics.

So $1 trillion left China, and it's bitcoing that is the concern? Isn't the entire marketcap like $5b? Obviously bitcoin used to exit is a drop in the ocean to their real concerns. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:48:10
I think Sanders can act as a catalyst to break up big banks, but will likely increase the deficit and spending to put many of his measures in place. 
On the other hand, maturing debt in emerging markets in combination with low commodity/oil prices will result in mass bailouts, or a domino effect of defaults (starting in emerging markets, before directly effecting western banks and governments). 
The high inflation reflected in emerging markets will result in many citizens racing exit their host currency. With the difficulties acquiring precious medals in most markets, it is not unlikely that they will start buying btc (assuming public awareness at that time)

Here is a link the the actual PwC report: 
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:36:21
This grant was simply part of a funding round for "digital inclusion". Out of about five companies that were funded in this round, this was the only bitcoin related grant.  The digital inclusion focus is focused towards encouraging merchant adopting of digital financial services. The foundation is not promoting anything, they have just given 100k as a "trial"  before the million dollar round that follows

Well, this is what they should be doing. In reality, they (or the deposit banks) are using the float to invest and lend.

@_date: 2015-03-11 10:22:03
Ok, so 3% fee to send via BitPesa. What is the total fee when taking into account everything? Bitcoin exchange spread, bitpesa, and cash out of M-Pesa? Add in the fluctuation in price from when the person buys bitcoin, to when he actually sends it, and the fee might be even more. This can end up costing more than a traditional MTO can't it? 
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:22:20
They will most likely require banks to hold larger deposits (as a ratio to lending), which in turn will reduce the amount of money lent. This will in effect remove the money from the economy, giving the illusion that the money has been reabsorbed although it is simply not in circulation.

Well, not to be a conspiracy theorist, but has anyone made the connection of D-Wave and Tim Draper? 
DFJ has funded D-Wave to the tune of $29 million. The 'D,' being Tim Draper, who bought 30,000 bitcoins.  
This is what Steve Jurvetson said in reguards to QC: "I did suggest that might be a lucrative QC background process a couple years ago and they looked at it, and just as this architecture is not particularly well suited for factoring integers, it's not particularly good at code cracking or bitcoin mining…. but…such a specialty QC could be built…

Doing less work and instead things you enjoy is the best option. I don't think the "retire and sit on the beach for the rest of my life" would sustain happiness long term. Now with the financial security there, it enables me to use my time to work on projects I like, without worry of a monthly pay check. It's best to stay frugal though-- we aren't on the moon yet.
