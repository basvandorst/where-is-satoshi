So in the past when I've sold something I've always been worried about my credit card details being stolen. I'm also concerned because my details are required like my name and address not for the reasons of delivery but for proof of my identity.
Cryptocoins removes this need. I don't give out my bank details, I can use escrow to ensure i get my goods and securely have my details setup with a courier service. 
The seller knows they will get the money, they won't get any chargebacks or stolen credit cards and there's little to no fees (hypothetical situation with a coin that has tiny fees) for them.
I've been hit hard before by ebays/paypal, for lack of a better word, bullshit fees. I'm personally tired of my bank making shedloads of money off of me when i try to save money and buy directly from other sellers in other countries all whilst taking ludicrous amounts of money in fees and returning pennies in savings interest.

From the UK i buy things from germany all the time.
Also 90% of the things i buy are made in other countries. My Occulus rift purchase certainly wasn't made in the UK.

I think when it comes to crypto it does not matter if it's a gift or not. When you made the trade to fiat you are selling something for British currency. The fact you are exchanging something for the currency is what is being taxed. Not the crypto. 
I'm no accountant but this is how I understand it.

That will be a good thing if fees come down. Although what makes you think fraud and chargebacks will decline?
So regarding the identity issue, there's always worries that my information will get intercepted/hacked/leaked/sold or abused. 
Check your email and see if any website you've ever used has been hacked and details have been captured. I know one of mine has 12 breaches. 
But besides this there are just companies that simple share your information for profits. People make a living by spamming, because it's fully funded by companies that are all legal and registered. 
I understand that some websites just simply need you to have an email registered for contact and security. But one of the purposes of cryptocoins is to digitize the act of going into a store with doing a simple quick transaction with paper cash but on the internet. You don't fill out any information in a store when paying with cash and that's what should be reflected online.

Meh I don't feel threatened by bcash in the slightest. 
Especially after watching that video.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:49:44
Yeah I blame myself too for having such greedy and selfish seniors that were fortunate to be spawned in at a time when house prices were cheap as chips.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:41:42
To be honest I haven't found anything. 
I bought BTC a long time ago on coinfloor before all the verifications and now i just store it in a wallet. 
Coinfloor isn't great now what with the zergs of people all trying to get in on the crypto currency action.
I would recommend if you want to invest, you should keep doing enough research into all the options until you can make your own mind up on what is the best. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:50:21
Well if I ever cashed out it would be in £ but no, I want the good currencies to become strong enough to support everyone who contributes and supports itself. 
But if that guy is the leader of that currency then I want no part of that. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:00:10
They probably thought that they had to move the coins from software to cold storage by actively transferring them or something?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:37:11
That 1000 people includes companies or groups. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:33:11
Better get that tongue off leo boots? never heard that expression before...if that's not what you're saying then quit wasting my time and explain yourself.
Besides, why did you even bother commenting on my post in the first place? Does it harm you in anyway that I post about someone else? Or do you just like to defend all "weak" and "innocent" millionaires?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:57:51
Then you should all have some coins of your own!
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:54:45
After watching this I'm getting rid of all bcash. I don't care if it makes money or blows up x1000. 
I'd rather be poor than be involved with some dickhead that rages and pulls the "I'M A MILLIONAIRE SO I'M BETTER THAN YOU" 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:02:22
brings me back to this wise speech
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:31:03
Next month 500 will turn into 580.88 at it's top.
Month after that 580.88 will turn into 734.11 
don't ask me how i know

I bought £30 worth of bitcoin a couple years ago. Now they are worth £700. I don't generally invest but I've got a bit there to help with a deposit for a house one day hopefully. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:22:54
Oh I'm so happy you are interested in it! 
That's really made my day honestly you are making decisions that will change the future for the better!

If you want to suffer as you get old that's on you. But I will carry on promoting the end of age related diseases and suffering. 
People choose to take vaccines and medicine. If they want to be destroyed by virus's and diseases that's on them.

Currently the whole network has so many people using it that it can't process your transaction quick enough. 
Paying a higher fee reduces the time it takes. 
If your transaction doesn't get processed it will "refund" after 2 weeks (I believe)
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:54:54
From what I've learned its essentially a random race.
Each miner is trying to brute force guess using an algorithm to get a certain number range.
The more computing power you have, the more 'guesses' you can pump out compared to others. 
Whoever gets the right number wins the prize.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:07:00
Google for sure. 
Search Engines is a good example. The internet was there but search engines changed it into what you see today. 
We have internet shopping, banking, transactions but cryptocurrency is the next stage and we'll see it change the internet in a good way.

I would highly encourage you to take a look at this foundation. 
I think it's something that can really benefit mankind and reduce suffering. If you ignore the immortality, the core of the research is to remove the suffering of ageing not actually stop it. But one of the side effects of curing diseases associated with ageing is that you tend to live longer. 
What you are doing is truly remarkeable and selfless in itself so you should be very proud but I implore you consider this foundation as I believe it's a huge investment in everyone's future. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:07:51
You should do research is what the guy is subtly saying.
"Will i win the lottery if i spend $100" is basically what you are asking. No one can you tell with 100% certainty if you will make a profit. 
However I would say it is smart to invest the amounts you are saying as bitcoin has a very high chance of becoming more and more valuable.

Paper wallets are the easiest! just remember to be careful (i'm sure you will) but here's a few pointers to help you understand crypto in the way that i got to understand. 
So firstly a bitcoin is never stored anywhere, it's stored EVERYWHERE. How this works is that each person has a ledger/database/record of each coin's owner. 
So lets first translate this to how banks and cash works now, say dollars. You go to a store and buy $10 worth of food. Instead of giving that store a $10 bill you hand them a small key that opens a vault that has $10 in it. You never hand over bitcoin(money) you just hand over ownership of the bitcoin in the form of a key. (Bitcoin Transactions)
Now ownership of all keys are stored in ledgers/databases/records that are all synchronized around the world and these are furiously synchronized as to ensure security.  (Nodes, Ledgers)
So to continue, how can the shop trust your key and it's value? well first the shop picks up the key, looks at it  and then the shop goes off and checks it's records and sees that indeed you did have this key. The shop will then ask other people to confirm that the records are accurate. They will confirm this and then to complete the transaction, all people will update their records to say that the shop now owns that key. (Block Chain, Mining, terribly explained but general idea)
And that's the way i interpret things! I hope it's not confusing! Wikipedia has everything you need for more technical indepth understanding!

Unless it goes to £300 i'll never make a loss lol.

There is so much power current banking systems use. Skyscraper offices that run 24/7, server farms that run 24/7, vehicles to transfer money, ATM's that run 24/7, Vaults and security systems that run 24/7...
I would question that energy estimate because it's definitely an estimate. They probably factored in every computer and devices consumption that touches anything coin related.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:26:21
Honestly I thought this could be some form of AI that's attempting to collect resources and wealth. If I was a super intelligent machine I wouldnt go guns blazing, I would do EXACTLY what is going on now. Pretend, blend, covertly take over and then once I've got enough funds and resources quietly continue with whatever my goal is. 
Perhaps it's goal is to better the world, maybe it wants to build rockets to get the hell away from us. 
Or maybe it's just your typical smart people doing smart things and being very smart about it. 
If I was the creator of a technology that could disrupt the entire global power structure, I'd want to be fully anonymous.

You're on the right track though, self sustainability is the key. It's just the lock doesn't secure anything if the door is made of paper. (if you get my drift)
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:28:42
Don't do that. Be intelligent not disrespectful. 
I did laugh though. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:40:24
Those places will get pillaged so quickly from thieves and militia.
It's a good sentiment but it's not a realistic proposal sadly.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:36:51
It would benefit people who "HODL" if they told others not to. Since they could buy at a low price if it crashed. Bitcoin would then eventually go back up because it's the most known coin and people trust it and it's the "easiest" to obtain. 
Easiest in the sense that other coins don't really make it easy for people to use cash to buy in.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:57:09
There is no such country surely? All exchanges usually go by dollar price. 
What country are you talking about?

I just wanted to comment to say i loved this wording 
"good god damn news!" haha!
Good luck with your bcash extraction, if you wanted an android app wallet that's really easy to use to do some trading with alt coins, take a look at coinomi I found it's a really painfree wallet!
