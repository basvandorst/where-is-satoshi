What are you trying to tell me? That I could trade my bitcoin for millions someday?
No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you are ready...
you won't have to.

If you want a phone app than binance is your only real option for active trading.

This. Bitcoin is definitely not anonymous.

Coinbase is a fiat gateway, binance is an actual exchange. You will have access to most trading pairs and the trading fee is .1% per trade. You will not be able to convert to dollars on binance, you'll still need to use coinbase for that.

A fiat gateway I'd a place where you can convert dollars into crypto and back into dollars.
GDAX is coinbase exchange. Since you have a coinbase account you already have a gdax account and can use that exchange to have a more traditional trading experience.
Bittrex, binance, kucoin cryptopia are all other exchanges that only use crypto pairs and therefore aren't fiat gateways. Only binance has a usable mobile app in my opinion. Kucoin does have an app, but you will find more obscure coins on that exchange. If you are new to trading and want to trade the top 100 cryptos I would stick with binance.

30 days ago 10k felt like the holy grail, now a drop to 13k is dark times...
What a time to be alive.

One use case would be for a large company (like Square) to use futures as a hedge against catastrophic loss. This would allow them to maintain large bitcoin reserves for use by clients in the square app. Many large investment companies use futures to mitigate risk, so it may bring needed risk management for large companies to adopt bitcoin.

You are correct, holding coins has been more profitable than spending that capital on mining equipment and mining as an investment. Mining is an important part of the network and is also fun in it's own right as a hobby, but financially hodling seems to be the better move (if the market continues as it has the past year).

I've had a bank accidentally deposit money in my account before as was tempted to withdraw it. I didn't, after speaking to a lawyer who said they can and will take it back. Although a slightly different situation, I wouldn't mess around with the banks. We are trying to overthrow them with crypto for a reason... don't get stuck in their crosshairs.
