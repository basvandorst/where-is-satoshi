I was barely making my mortgage repayments, I had no job. I put everything I had into crypto. I am now a millionaire.

Tweaked.

I'm working on that at the moment, except it will be at the top for those with a lot of positions :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:41:58
Hah, thanks for that.
Fixing it now.

I am looking at adding all exchanges as I get time :)

I am planning to support mobile in the future, unfortunately due to this being an unpaid project I have limited time to spend on it.
I look forward to your valuable contributions in the future.

You might enjoy  released it yesterday.

Not sure what you are looking at but there is nothing happening.

I will add a check to see if it has been viewed so it doesn't popup after you remove it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:56:09
I will have a think about it.

How about instead of accusing my FREE site of begging for donations you actually post something useful like what browser versions you are using etc. so I can fix the issue you are having.  is what the site should look like.

1%, so brave

I designed it specifically not to use accounts.
Your positions are stored using local storage, which means you can add your positions, and they will still be there if you close and open your browser. Test it to see what I'm talking about.
The only time this will become an issue is if you use multiple computers/browsers but unless you have a huge amount of positions it shouldn't be that painful to set it up once on each.
To track multiple purchases just keep adding positions, is that what you mean?

As I get time I plan to add different exchanges, litecoins and a lot of other features.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:18:19
Tommorrow? I think they have already packed up and gone.

Yeah, the MtGox feed is flakey a lot of the time. Unfortunately not much I can do to fix that.

Sorry I can't read your mind, what exactly are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:37:39
I have used  and a friend uses  . Bitinnovate is normally quicker at delivery but omni is normally within 4 hours of deposit at bank.
One thing to keep in mind these sites are a bit more expensive normally charging ~10% but at the rate BTC is climbing most of the time you will lose out waiting for a wire or bank deposit to MtGox which is normally a 2 day turn around.

I thought this might help people instead of working out timezones.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:06:04
Mine is currently at 7.76 gb
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:51:16
Good idea, I will have a look into this.
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:21:37
Thanks for the feedback.
The UI will change a lot, everything was just slapped together last night. Will also be making it responsive so it can be viewed on a mobile devices.
I have just updated the site to include totals (these will change also I just did them as they are as a few people were asking for them)
I will be changing it to use Bid instead of Ask.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:51:37
Thanks for the compliment.
Regarding the idea, while I don't think it's a bad one in theory, it could be seen as spamming. I think a better approach would be to get someone to write a nice generic email and make it publicly available for people to send via their personal email accounts.
