Lucky when you find old shit like that. I had a good handful for a while. I know I had more than a hundred at one point. Would had been the best thing ever sincer they would conver all my student loan debt and let me return.
How life changing do you feel it's going to be for you?

I more find it fascinating. it also seems very possible it will, at times, be moderately concerning. I'm also functionally autistic and just like gaining knowledge so maybe that's the only real driving factor to being interested like this.Find lots of things fascinating. So since I can't do things I'd usually get distracted by, the trip to work seems right now to be a good time to try to think about more about the greater world population. It's very interesting like I said. And it's not all bad too. Sorry for the very poor wording and structure.
Edit: haven't watched bojack yet, sorry. Just finished Rick and Morty.

I was expecting a political aspect to the story. Something about the conflict on the Columbian border messing with the economy. Poor guess on my part

I get such poor coverage on the news here. Only heard about it because Ive just started listening to international news on the way to and from work. I wouldn't have known anything about the India /Pakistan conflict. Just kinda blows my mind that nobody knows about it now that I hear about it. It's big important news and has an effect on the global scale. Why didn't I do this before? Why don't more people do it?

What about the inevitable heat death of the universe.
