correct, if you do a transfer from your checkings account, it is much cheaper than if you do it from your debit card. But using a debit card is instant however the fees are much higher and the limit is $1000 whereas using your bang account there is a limit of $5000 initially.

Yes that would be the cheapest way but you can also find a bitcoin atm and buy it there too but there is a small fee

What you gonna say when it hits 10k?
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:03:04
Ethereum and bitcoin, you can just put money into a place like coinbase and purchase any amount of bitcoin that you have money for.

The price may or may not reach 10k, but for sure I know that it might, but be careful because it will eventually change and at that point you possibly will want to make a decision about a decision on whether or not to make a decision.

What about ethereum?
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:45:54
Buy it 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:49:50
Oh I see. You need to do more research to understand what you are buying other wise you will lose money in the long run. Just go to coinbase.com and using your debit card or bank account you can purchase bitcoin. But first just Google what is bitcoin, etc..and start reading!!
