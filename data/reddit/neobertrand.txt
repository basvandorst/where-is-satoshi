I subscribed for 2 years eth mining, and I will not even get my money back.
They of course don't even reply to questions except before yiu send your money to them.

Don't know how people cannot be confused?
I've sold bitcoins. I will see after the fork if it's more clear.
So much money in something that people don't know  what it will become in 10 days ?

Just because nobody has idea of what will happen in  10 days makes great uncertainty.
And great uncertainty lead to a very big correction.

I have a contract with Genesis Mining for eth mining. They don't reply to mails when they don't like it.
I receive less and less payment and it's not interesting at all compare to what I've invested.
On my account on their website, there's even some payment listed that I never received, for me they were never send. I asked them why and never got any reply.
If you can escape them do it as quick as you can, but I doubt they will even reply to you.

Should be tumultuous until and after the fork I think.
Better sell now and see later.

A little under 5000 $.

Selling on kraken is like real hell.
Better sell quickly, it's getting more and more difficult to sell.

It's just getting worse and worse.

Bobody understand where Bitcoin is going.
The only logic is to sell and see later if there's a clear direction.

I've never used chrome.. Except since I bought a ledger. The choice of chrome for the ledger was such a bad choice !!
