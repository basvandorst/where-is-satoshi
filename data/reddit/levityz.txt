Wasnt it the government who forced banks to make loans to people who couldnt afford them the spark that set everything ablaze? This guys just keeps blaming the banks but not sure it went down 100% like that... am i wrong?

Im not sure there were as many people getting in as you think. Obviously i dont think it will go up to 100k this year but i have a feeling adoption was still relatively low last december. Most people were hearing about it but not investing imo.

Completely disagree with this. Government cares about nothing but creating more government.

Bull. Capitalism cant work correctly without a moral people as its base and moral people dont let kids starve on the streets. People help people when they dont ecpect the government to do it with the theft of their money.

Lol... i get where ur comin from and maybe if our taxes werent so ridiculously high i would be ok with some but our tax scheme is highway robbery and they waste the money anyways. The government is helping no one by taking money away from people trying to feed their own families so that they can give it to some welfare queen who has 10 kids from 10 different dudes. Its all good until you cant afford the insurance lol.
