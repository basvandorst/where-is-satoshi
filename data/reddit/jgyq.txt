I was not aware it was hyphenated. Me and grammar do not get along. I was trying to point out the hypocrisy of the comment, which was really the point of my comment not simply the misspelling.

Down voted for misspelling down voted while criticizing another person for grammar. :)

They never expressed anything to make me think they were interested. I'm trying to spread the word here and my grammar and marketing is not up to par. So here I am here looking for help with presenting it. 
I think that instead of giving them links that they have to research I would include the relevant information for them directly. Think of it as marketing. Professional marketers do not require their clients to do the work. They do it for them and present it in an intelligible way for the receiving party.
I think of this as a bonus for them with little to no downside and am looking for a way to present it to them as such professionally.
I could half ass it and hope for the best but I really believe in crypto and see this as my opportunity to contribute.

Varies wild and unpredictably, or instant conversion. Please clarify I got my dick stuck in a toaster due to poor instruction. :)

How would it if it is instantly convert to fiat? To my knowledge, which is limited compared to others, coinbase offers instant conversion for merchants.

This is a quote from the link you provided
"If the cardholder complaint is proven untrue, no refund is requested from the merchant, though additional processing fees may be charged." So a BS complaint can result in additional fees being charged . This is pretty much one of the benefits of Bitcoin. No fees for a BS charge. A legitimate retailer should not be concerned with this IMO.

It looks promising to add to my pitch or at the very minimum add as a source if further questions are asked by the merchant. I am in the process of reading through the details and if it all turns out to be legit I will send it to the merchant with all credit to you. Would you mind if I sent them your way if I was unable to answer a relevant question of theirs?

I paid $250 each for my tickets to the USGP that's why I said that. Of course they are more expensive when your talking about a suite. Either way that's just too much to me for a conference. Just personal opinion and in no way a statement about the quality of the conference.

Thank you for your comment. So far I think this is the best approach. I think your style of writing may very well entice them to accept Bitcoin. Like I hinted at in my post I am horrible at conveying a point (writing) and would like to add that I am just a user and have nothing to gain. I think this may help to get them past the thought of me trying to scam them. 
This is for a rappers clothing line and perhaps throwing in the comment by snoop dogg/lion or whatever he is calling himself these days accepting Bitcoin for his next album may help. I'm just not sure how to word it to not step on the their ego causing them to dismiss the idea.

I think this may be a bit to much to include in my request to accept Bitcoin. I may be wrong but IMO if a the site admin were to  receive a message with anything to do about lawsuits and law enforcement, especially to a rappers web site I would be worried more than accepting of the idea.

I mentioned that the payment is not reversible. No charge backs seems to be a better wording though. Thank you.

Can you give me some link to those endorsements? I know of the snoop endorsement but the others would be handy, you know in case they question it.

I saw your link to the Texas Bitcoin Conference and got excited. Then I saw it was at the Circuit of the Americas and became ecstatic. That is until I saw the $325 ticket price. Now I know there are some very smart people involved in Bitcoin but whoever thought it was acceptable to charge more than the tickets to the US Grand Prix (which was was held at the same venue) has lost their damn mind.

I'm inclined to believe that this is exactly the reason. Bought and paid for legislators are the majority these days and some of them don't care if it's obviously so.
