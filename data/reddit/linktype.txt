Why are people downvoting this?
@_date: 2016-08-23 21:11:12
tell them to open accounts at the exchanges where they live in.. should be easier to converter/transfer this way.
Or to open a account at bitpay.

You will have to wait for your bitcoin core wallet to finish the sync, then put some high fees like: 0.0005 and transfer to your circle account.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:16:17
Reading this really hurt my brain.
If you had 1000$ in your bitgo account it would also cost 7$ in btc fees to move them.

Why are you promoting a mostly centralized network, with a futurely broken PoS implementation?
Specially after all the crypto and distributed systems experts claim that PoS is broken.
Don't you think its a vunerability/central point of failure exchanges like coinbase, poloniex, kraken, that hold millions of ethereum to be staking? Among other technicalities.

You can buy on circle or gemini.
But i would suggest gemini for amounts like 5k $, because you can get a better discount buying them.
Circle is for small buys.

You can prune the blockchain right now to 1gb, but you still have to download all the blockchain history, for integrity reasons.
Soon you will be able to transact bitcoins while the blockchain is downloading, check github.com/bitcoin

Well written Adam, its pretty clear, whats logical and whats political.
Edit: Can someone explain to me and define very well, **WHY in the world**, we have been in need for bigger blocks(and some other things, also included), and now that there's a clearly (years in testing) not perfect but good enough solution called segwit, some community members decide this is wrong and will work on divide the community?

This comparison is retarded, there is much more to it. Are we getting to the other sub level?
Segwit is gonna get activated, miners have 10months to start signaling before the window closes. The BU team will eventually fuck up, some other release, while core will thrive with 2 new upcoming releases, before segwit window closes.
Also its important litecoin segwit gets activated.

they say they refuse, reality is they don't know how to do it.
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:22:23
Which means less nodes brings more centralisation, which means more control from people who run those nodes, which means they can end up censoring transactions which they dont like
@_date: 2017-03-09 01:50:54
If the fork happens the price will go down, and the fork will die. Why? Hundreds of services run on core tech, there is not even one company willing to take on BU, because companies are not willing to risk funds with untested tech such as BU

You have to wait or contact bitquick. What the said is, for you to use another wallet called electrum which helps you push transactions.
But mycelium is also fine for mobile
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:06:41
Ofc he's right but not in the head. Segwit brings larger blocks if you didn't know.

Those coins can't scale and have no liquidity. Ex: Most are only traded on poloniex, if poloniex goes down all those coins die.

What’s the reason to choose an Android Bitcoin Core full node instead a Linux/Windows/Macintosh one?
ABCore runs on Android Devices and you have these advantages:
-No need to keep active your PC/Server 24/7
-Low power consumption
-Easy replace external hard drive to store the Block-Chain
-You can install it on home devices that are already active 24/7 (like Minix Neo)
This is lovely.

Its clear as water that this thread is a eye opener for the wide bitcoin community when it comes to Roger Ver. Its not just me. 
I dont care about thread karma.
Roger Ver won't listen to more technical people such as the core devs, who have been developing and mantaining the reference client for years. So theres nothing left(technical) to argue about.
Only reality check about this person.

@_date: 2017-01-31 02:05:24
TL;DR chinese miners will keep the status quo due to language barrier, and mostly bad propaganda being spread around segwit and BU implementation.
But if miners see segwit activated on litecoin and the price raise they might consider.
This sickens me.

Roger Ver when he say stuff like that, it shows how delusional he is. Once segwit activates and LN's start operating it will be game over for that bcash altcoin. Even if he has 100k bitcoins all he can do is fucking play the market for a while before he gets outed.

There are several “20% improvement” factors on the horizon, and together they multiply to give significant improvements in scalability as software improves. Rising fees are causing wallet authors to (finally!) begin optimizing their transactions, because users are noticing.
Block propagation has gotten better (see centralization above) and slightly less coupled to blocksize, and validation has gotten much faster (thanks much to libsecp256k1) which may see us close the gap between the theoretical 1MB blocksize and the current 850k average blocksize.
Segregated Witness should increase blocks to about 2MB, though it depends how quickly the ecosystem (wallets and other transaction businesses) start using it.
Segregated witness makes signatures (aka “witnesses”) discardable, and gives them a discount over parts of transactions which must be kept (ie. unspent outputs). This should bias wallets towards using it so more of the blocks can be discarded by nodes.
Replace-by-fee is becoming more common: this allows you to bump the fee on transactions which are taking too long to confirm. This not only means you can be more aggressive on lowering fees, it also allows you to combine multiple payments into one if you have them, which reduces your total transaction size.
**On the horizon are Schnorr signatures, which can be combined together, reducing witness size even further: instead of a transaction with two inputs which are each a 33 byte key and 72 byte signature, we might have two 33 byte keys, and a single signature. Interestingly, this also provides an incentive to adopt mixing protocols (like TumbleBit) because they are smaller and hence cheaper, helping the network fungibility even if you don’t care about fungibility yourself.**
I love whats in bold, but the thing is... segregated witness needs to be activated first.

Shilling segregated witness:
Misinformation: 
-Is actually Antpool signaling with bitcoin BU? No.
-Roger Ver whole twitter feed, is misinformation one of the best examples is this one:
He tries to correct his Rep by telling people mtgox disaster as due to banking issues. Yea sure.
-Muh censorship crap, the rules of this sub are pretty clear.
(Which teams? I don't think the that the core team that actually delievers new performance fixes got anything of those creepy 1.2 million.)

Use gemini, instead of some shady exchange.
Also fuck coinbase.
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:38:21
I know this might sound crazy but there are mining pools already expecting a bitcoin split
@_date: 2017-01-08 13:13:14
This is not bitcoin related. Also avoid buying scamcoins. Wait for rootstock to be released.
@_date: 2017-01-15 03:56:54
1 transaction doesn't mean it was from point A to B, it could have been from A to B,C,D, etc. Also theres lots of offchain transactions.

Thanks for decentralise the network!

You guys are seeing it wrong.
You are free to sell you bitcoins if you want. But bitcoin is part of a evolution. Don't sell them for cheap, or just sell a few bits lol.

If you do understand math you know that a more valueable bitcoin is more profitable to miners

To backup the comment above, read this:
Roger Ver wants to break the bitcoin consensus system, and since he is shitload rich, he can pull attacks like these, bribing miners and pool owners.

Its very sad to watch this unfold. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:11:56
Running a node contributes also, no need to be mining. You show the miners that you are segwit ready.
@_date: 2017-01-19 07:25:19
I dont like roger ver, and he behaves like a kid in his 40's. But dont open threads poluting this sub about him.
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:50:37
Have you read the tweets of their number one fanatic? Roger Ver? He clearly states bitcoin should be paypal 2.0, and promotes monero and other altcoins.
@_date: 2017-01-30 04:53:14
This, add this also to the article its accurate
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:01:03

I hope when reading these issues, **you will realise that the Bitcoin Unlimited team might actually be the most careful committers and testers, with a very broad and dedicated test infrastructure.** And I hope that you will see these Bitcoin Core commits— bugs that are not tricky and esoteric, but simple issues that well known to average software engineers —and commits of “Very Ugly Hack” code that do not reflect the care required for an important financial network. I hope that you will realise that, contrary to **statements from Adam Back and others, the Core team does not have unique skills and abilities that qualify them to administer this network.**
administer the network... this is how ex-corporate programmers still think..
the network is mantained, not "administered"
@_date: 2017-01-23 15:24:18
Yes they are crazy.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:00:42
People please calm down.
Its too early down loose your cool. Some of the companies on that list don't actually support 2x (some have withdrawn)
Keep yourself alert, but don't panic or start threads telling people to withdraw their coins or else.... FUD.
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:19:31
The backbone of bitcoin network works by people running bitcoin core.
Bitcoin Core is open-source, anybody can modify the code and compile it.
Bitcoin Unlimited is a copy of bitcoin core, but with modifications that benefit other users. In this case, it benefits miners, because it allows them to make more money by including more transactions which means more money from fees.
The above, is called a contentious fork. Which means that the blockchain can split into two. 
We can only hope that the miners don't run this software, otherwise it defragments bitcoin consensus system as a whole.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:04:53
The 2x hardfork in reality bumps the blocksize to 8MB's educate yourself boy.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:30:14
The core devs vision, is to anybody to be able to run a node with a wallet with low end specs. But some people keep trying to derail this vision into 20k dollars servers to run nodes aka centralization.

Run a node. Use it to connect to it and run services or a wallet on top of it.
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:46:28
The unlimited client is a fork from Core. They change the consensus rules, trying a contentious split, like it happened on Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:43:25
This is very sad to watch... The same thing goes to mining pools, that are running behind Core nodes and showing support for BU with their altered nodes.
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:37:00
If you are from US i recommend gemini, if you are from europe i use kraken.

If you want lower fees, use exchanges like gemini or kraken
@_date: 2017-01-09 06:46:05
Schnorr sigs, will get at least another 20% more space on the blocks for more transactions, after segwit gets activated.
But if its not enough by then, yea, we could get segwit to raise more space for tx's.
The thing is that segwit brings at least 9 major bug fixes, where short term scalability is one of them.

Roger Vermin has been nothing but a headache for the community these past 2 years. Plus he owns bitcoin.com i can't think a worse person to manage it.
@_date: 2016-12-13 07:44:10
Exchanges send with the right fees (most of them). When its from wallets that u control, you have to set your own, or send from a dyn wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:21:42
For android, and buying, i would say coinbase
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:54:01
Yes, you should access your exchange account, from a VM, preferably linux based. Then use a long pw randomly generated ( i use keepassx ), save the password there ( also on the vm ), encrypt your VM dont use remote tools like teamviewer. Access the account via API.
That it.
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:17:18


Localbitcoins or Bitcoin ATM.
You can use localbitcoins and go to a bank branch and wire the money to the other person, and get the recipt, send the recipt to the seller, and he sends you the coins. No need to meet up.
(see if there's a BTC atm near you).
@_date: 2016-12-01 07:19:23

Core doesn't decide anything consensus related boy. Core is a loose bunch of contributors. 
If there is raw consensus on something they will code it.
The hardfork we are talking here is against the opinion of these core devs, why? Because companies dont decide bitcoin and the hardfork hasnt been tested enough, it would defragment the consensus boy.

@_date: 2016-11-18 02:57:21
btcd and bitcore, from what Im seeing they are mostly ready. Then again it would be wonderful to see most of these projects gaining traction instead of the reference implementation ( satoshi client ) getting fragmented.

Why sell the miners, if you can mine too...
Mining is a zero sum game.
@_date: 2016-11-15 10:22:19
Btcc is the oldest. And never got hacked.
@_date: 2016-12-26 17:15:57
Yea i was referring to litecoin xD
@_date: 2016-11-30 07:35:41
Im sure that in time, the rest of the major pools will follow, having a split will crash the price, a break the miners profits.
If no split, there will be the status quo, which is fine by me.
@_date: 2016-11-17 15:28:55
Less than 100blocks. We can have segwit by christmas, that would be a nice present for all of us.
@_date: 2016-12-04 23:46:50
Is it already listed here 
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:00:41
There not going to be a hardfork or bitcoin will split. Segwit provides more room for offchain solutions to develop. The whole thing is as simple as this that i just said.
@_date: 2016-11-15 02:44:19
This is really good, coinify will deal with the charge backs?
This might beat circle and coinbase.
@_date: 2016-11-29 21:53:27
Lol, so much ignorance.
@_date: 2016-11-06 19:04:15
The morals of about ~100 contributors? Thats a lot of morals to worry about.
@_date: 2016-11-03 23:41:11

Competition to gemini?
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:50:39
to keep bitcoin decentralized, and not being run by pools and companies.
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:54:03
What about bitpay adding child pays for parent (CPFP) scheme to push those unconfirmed low fee transactions?
@_date: 2016-12-31 06:28:24
You get anonimity when you send bitcoin between wallets that "you" control. Not between bitcoin/banking services.
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:48:19
blocks right now are taking a while to be solved. Thats why there's a queue on the transactions list, waiting to be confirmed.
@_date: 2016-12-10 09:36:11
I think that they need segwit activated in order to finish the payment channels
@_date: 2016-12-05 02:31:07




If that holds true, does that mean, that core is following through with what they signed on the round-table?
@_date: 2016-12-27 04:26:32
Dont do this. You will loose your funds.
@_date: 2016-11-06 22:38:32
Those nodes are not good for mining

This is a bitcoin subreddit.
Nobody here gives a flying fuck about Bcash as its just another altcoin/shitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-28 22:38:19
So its the miners and companies who should dictate bitcoin?
Core, never dictated anything, segwit has been discussed for years... If some miners dont like it, maybe the reason is because they want more control?
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:07:37
Post the issue at LND or eclair github issues section.

Report this. Doesnt come from the wallet autor.
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:45:01
dont use coinbase.
If you are in europe, use kraken.com
@_date: 2016-12-26 14:40:33
No he doesnt control.
He sells them the propaganda that segwit is bad.
When in reality he never coded in his entire life even one hello world line code.
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:34:12
Its true what he said.

@_date: 2016-12-15 04:31:29
I got sick from reading that comment on the bitcoin unlimited github repository.
Good AMA, these two core contributors clearly know what they are talking about.
And im happy to know that LN and side chains are possible even without the segwit activation, but the latter wont happen.

Luke jr and petertodd signed in hong kong, that segwit would be implemented as a hardfork. But then it was discovered that could be done as a softfork, which is much better, for nodes sake.

This. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:11:17
Not a app.
Bitcoin core is the name of tge reference client that satoshi was developing.
Bcash is a copy paste from bitcoin core client that is a china made knock off from the original btc.
Theres also bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond, and even one called bitcoin core.
Make no mistake, bitcoin is bitcoin(btc).
@_date: 2016-11-01 11:50:17
Yes, people sell ethereum to buy bitcoin.
Ethereum has too many design flaws, too many undiscovered vunerabilities, and is centralized.
They always have a new hardfork each month, making services like coinbase to be mad and choose their own fork.
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:38:08
Why is your name there?

@_date: 2016-11-16 02:11:59
Agree. Im sad that miners such as viabtc, and roger ver, want to block years of testing and implementation that segwit is.
@_date: 2018-06-28 03:25:52

For saving and holding bitcoin, most people recommend you to buy hardware wallets like trezor. But i recommend you to setup a electrum wallet in a clean computer and save the seed phrase for backup puporses :)
@_date: 2016-11-06 02:34:46
yes, keep the seed stored written in a paper, or print it.
anyone with your seed can take your bitcoins.

Runs on bitcoinj, one of the projects listed above.
Its mostly one dev fixing bugs (check the github commits), and then on the other side there are people signing letters and spreading money to bitcoind forks with political motivations.

Not recommended, but coinbase.
I would recommend gemini
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:37:54
Up your fees if it is a priority transaction dude. Other wise make it a low fee.

And th e mtgox case, I almost deposited when he made that video, telling us mtgox was solvent. People lost million on mtgox. Roger Ver should sell all his bitcoin and withdraw from the community.

Anyone can propose a commit/change/patch, from there if its good and gets good reviews it gets merged...
Isn't this enough?
Or would you rather prefer a commité in each country deciding what gets in and call it the democratic core contributors of bitcoin? Lololol
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:52:26
Roger Ver, only thing he wants to scalate is his control over bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:27:08
Point one is the same as point four.
@_date: 2016-11-23 02:34:54
Hardfork -&gt; new rules, everyone has to upgrade and i mean all the 5000 nodes.
Softfork -&gt;mantains compatibility with older version nodes and adds new rules.
do you want the price to panic as hundreds of bitcoin services have to go down to update, it costs companies money to upgrade the nodes, resources, etc.
There are people still running 0.8 versions of bitcoin core nodes, helping the network stay decentralized because there hasn't been a forced hardfork for a long time.
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:37:54
circle is the alternative.
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:29:46

Yea me too stopped me from remembering.
@_date: 2016-12-21 05:11:24
What about segwit, and the hardfork?
@_date: 2016-12-01 00:59:52
SegWit will fix, mostly the 0-confirm tx's, read here.

Its a disaster that Roger Ver controls bitcoin.com and runs a casino/slots/bingo/news/altcoin pumps/etc/paid (recommended) wallets.

@_date: 2018-06-21 02:11:07
Hi James! Simple question... There is no doubt that bitpay wants the best for its costumers.. 
So why hasn't bitpay implemented SegWit?
Segwit provides cheaper transactions for everyone.
I stoped using your platform a while ago and have been recomending  to other mearchants.
I will be back using bitpay when you guys implement segwit :)
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:41:32
Or maybe wait until it gets confirmed
@_date: 2016-11-19 08:00:32
The new will, will be badass, coinshuffle will solve a lot of problems.
@_date: 2019-10-28 11:29:25
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:55:54
Do you know for how long segwit has been in tests, and how many devs have been testing it?
sipa the segwit arquitect, has been developing for a very long time for bitcoin core.
people that say segwit is complex, don't know what they are talking about, most of segwit code is just tests written in python.
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:25:33
But thats what segwit does with the blockraise
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:31:37
If we hit the 1200$ all time high. Bitcoin will be all over the news.
@_date: 2016-12-23 19:22:24

If we dont get segwit activated, the other competing coin will do it, and we get left behind.

Maybe we got to r/all on some post
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:52:59
Yes and that insecure web wallet doesn't even use segwit.
There are better wallets, like samourai wallet
@_date: 2016-11-17 02:43:36
There was a exchange called bitcoil google them, they refer to bits of gold.
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:04:47

@_date: 2016-12-28 15:30:19
no waits on gemini, once you are verified.
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:22:28
Open a account on gemini
@_date: 2016-12-22 11:43:06
Yes very much looking for it. Even tho, i think segwit will activate.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:01:37
@_date: 2016-12-27 04:14:19
Adoption, keeps happening, the only difference is: Merchants dont announce it on reddit anymore.
And since you are from US, try gemini instead of coinbase. I think you will be better served.
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:52:39
vultr.com accepts bitcoin, i use them instead.
@_date: 2018-06-04 09:56:22
Stop using bitpay.
Ask the merchant to use another provider.
@_date: 2016-12-24 05:26:13
Bitpay indeed. Steam is using them.
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:28:56

@_date: 2016-12-23 21:09:16
Core has been maintaining the reference client for years. They made many modification to help bitcoin scale, be stable as a network.
You think there are lots of people capable of doing that? Good luck.
@_date: 2016-11-13 15:40:14
Yes it needs to be a side effect. :D
@_date: 2016-12-03 06:27:44
I think he is drunk lol
@_date: 2016-11-23 05:41:20
Even better. Bitpay could push a unconfirmed payment lasting at least 1h via CPFP, making 0-confirms safe again.
@_date: 2016-11-30 07:29:26
Btc.com isnt signaling segwit.
@_date: 2016-12-31 06:23:53
If you want privacy, use localbitcoins. But the btc there costs more.
If you want better than coinbase use gemini
@_date: 2016-11-17 13:18:37

@_date: 2016-11-05 23:06:15
Yes. They also have a fauce which gives you give, but you cant withdraw them you need at least 0.001 btc to withdraw i think.

@_date: 2016-11-16 02:41:46
You think having unlimited blocksizes, does any good to decentralization of bitcoin?
Bribes, forks, consensus breaking, etc is any good to bitcoin?
People like roger should stay away from the community.

@_date: 2016-12-17 02:49:04
Bitcoin is better than ever. Im not really worried about the segwit activation. It has been said that lightning network can work without segwit... BUT i will be sad if we can't get malleability issue fixed once for all.
Things like, tumblebit, mimblewimble, sidechains, will evolve bitcoin. 
Im not worried about altcoins, i see them as a complement to bitcoin, years have proven that they can't take bitcoin throne.
What worries me are the miners that will mine for a profit, breaking the consensus... but my experience watching bitcoin grow, shows me that as long devs keep inovating we won't get stuck in political manipulations.
@_date: 2018-06-20 05:43:21
There was no hack. This exchange might be trying to buy the bottom, selling us FUD for dumping or... Trying to avoid taxes claiming they got hacked.

My TL;DR bitmain uses a hidden/covert asics hash performance optimization to get ahead of their mining competitors, this is the reason they wanted to block segregated witness (which the exploit doesn't) work.

@_date: 2017-04-25 01:45:43
here: 
He made a BIP draft explaining. He doesn't want to block it, but make transparent that miners are using it.
Otherwise bitmain would get a 2000% profit margin using a patented/hidden "innovation", advantage.
I don't object the use of asicboost, i object doing it covert/hidden use of it.

Imagine those drug lords once they discover they can save their fortune in bitcoin, instead of having their assets from by the police
@_date: 2017-04-25 03:16:33
nope, because 20% performance advance, in a 0 sum game such as mining provides at least 2000% in profit.
example: if you go to a casino play slots and you know a trick that gives you a 20% advantage vs the casino, you can profit much more than 20%

Why would they put asicboost in all their production miners? silicon costs money.
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:35:01
This exploit degrades the network efficiency it needs to be patched.
@_date: 2017-04-06 02:04:30
For those people starting to read on this exploit, it seems that it was a hidden/covert patented on asicboost exploit, that would let only a selected number of pools including the caught red handed antpool/bitmain to mine with a top 30% performance.

Why is this bad? They were blocking protocol upgrade such as segwit, while centralising the network hashrate, or cripple it at will.

This is a big nono, and every bitcoiner should oppose this type of centralisation.
@_date: 2017-04-21 02:19:03

@_date: 2018-11-07 02:59:49
if you can't move those coins to a wallet, they aren't ur coins.

The easiest deployment is this one:

After they use the miners for themselfs, they sell the miners to the public. 
Not recommended.

Please promote btcpay server :P
@_date: 2019-04-04 03:03:13
Hey, at least miners are happier reaping those fees, meaning we have a more secure network hashrate.
Situations like these will keep happening, and they are needed, to develop a fee market once the block reward gets lower.
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:00:16
Cool, lets see if russia keeps going up!
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:08:36

Localbitcoins or paxful or btc-e.
@_date: 2017-04-18 02:30:15
Or maybe use the raspberry pi to run a node.

What about tripadvisor?
@_date: 2016-09-24 05:12:05
This release will be epic, beacause of the segwit activation.
@_date: 2016-09-09 04:19:26
Can you paste the blockchain link of the said stuck transaction?
I though so. Go fud somewhere else, before coming here saying " i might try using a more user friendly coin "
@_date: 2016-09-15 00:53:01
this is known, most retailers will use at least one confirm to receive btc's.

So this is similar to xotika.tv, but for general entertainment.
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:57:55
Both litecoin and dogecoin have more transactions than bcash.
I think in the future roger vermin will spam its own bcash network to show that it has more transactions
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:45:54
Downvoted. Roger Vermin website also bcash pump machine.
@_date: 2018-11-13 03:24:57
Only a fool would put money into bcash.

buy TetherUSD and transfer it elsewhere safe like bitfinex.. 
This is the alternative
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:34:11
Why? Do you have a crystal ball ?
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:58:49
Hey, man if you are in a hurry the fastest way will be localbitcoins or similar, they will ask for a cash deposit and release the btc after that.
If you are not in a hurry i would suggest to join any popular exchange and get verified.
Edit: About the wallet, use mycelium for android, or breadwallet for iOS.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:21:26
There's a altcoin already doing this.

@_date: 2018-03-07 06:21:28
No one should own that twitter page, specially to promote bcash crap.
Its bad enough a felon to own bitcoin dot com.

Open a github issue.

His opinion on bitcoin is the most uneducated comment i have seen.
@_date: 2016-09-22 05:05:45
You wont get chargebacks for sure.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:26:11
better to run this release now. BIP148 was a success.
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:18:05
Paxful, localbitcoins or bitsquare
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:41:55
Somebody touch ma spaguett

No. Do you even watch charts?
@_date: 2017-09-09 11:58:10
Pow change incoming.
Hopefully most 2x companies will withdraw, there is no need for rushed hardfork, with shnorr, and LN coming.
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:45:56
Install greenaddress wallet, or any otherwallet support segwit, for cheap fees.

You alone could do a better job than the entires list of contributors right?
@_date: 2018-03-10 07:30:12
That fee % is deception to bitcoin users. If you want to promote bcash put also a image of roger vermin on the payment popup, sure you will more bcashers using ur service.
Im recommending to new merchants 
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:14:26
I think its you who is confused.
Cobra represents fuck shit.
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:37:22
What is this thread? Trying to pump the price or troll?
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:10:11
FUD starter.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:28:31


you can change your routing fees to whatever % you want. ie: 2% each transaction.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:45:55
Nah, thanks. Someone beat me on this submition.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:11:18
No disrespect to you, but fuck you if you think people are working just for you.
Did you help the devs on this release to make it faster?
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:39:47
You go on the website to redeem ur coins, wtf are you talking about
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:39:12
Proof of stake doesnt work.
If the coin if valuable the exchanges that hold most of the coins will stake them, and maybe merge between them to stake more coins.
Then again we have another crypto federal reserve.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:11:07
Companies will backoff once they realise that no-replay protection will get them sued.
Developers leaving is a big blow for this space also.

Seems they have a tier1-2-3 fees. That is stupid. They indeed could lower the fees, in order to get more users.
@_date: 2016-09-17 05:57:33
Modern bitcoin wallets will do this automaticaly. For example blockchain.info
There's no need to choose a fee.
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:02:40
Lol iota, clearly this is why, shitcoins have value, people like these
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:30:07
Fuck me. I was literally thinking about this.. someone should sell a heater as a bitcoin miner.
Needs to be cheaper tho..

Report those errors on bitcoin github, dont forget the debug log.

Wanna hear something mind blown? Why doesn't btc1 fork with the same consensus rules as bitcoin? decentralize "githubs", instead of messing with bitcoin security by raising the weightsize
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:25:42
Every supporter of segwit2x/btc1 is not a developer besides jeff garzik.

The bigger the blockchain the harder it is to people to run a node. Running nodes means total privacy and control over your bitcoins.
Trusting third parties means trusting central services and might as well trust paypal or venmo at this point.

Problem between subs is that one advocates to centralization and embark on tactics such as hardforks, altcoin pumps and social media fud.
Other one is where the price parties/memes actually happen during price rallies.
Honey badger wont give a fuck about both subs tho.
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:09:24
This is really important, people by nature have a need to follow somebody ie: jesus
In bitcoin this does not hold, and satoshi was't jesus, just a programmer with heavy skills of game teory and much more. Not a God.
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:38:07
You fail at life if you think there is no demand for bitcoin.
In your head satoshi created bitcoin because it was fun, and there was no use cases for it?
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:36:12
Well, if that bet was made... Roger Vermin would loose.
Now this new one roger ver wants to loose again

But you think people are waiting on segwit2x :/ for all of this.

No. The consensus code was set in stone. Whats left is only to make it better, not to change it.

Careful with this service guys.
There are github scripts to automate this.
Its way safer.

Does anyone one on this subreddit has a cristal ball to predict that?

These softfork should not be enforced by miners! But rather enforced by users and companies! Go BIP8!

No, this is a classic, mods wouldn't remove it.

@_date: 2017-09-07 20:48:16
its not a scam, its a ICO for a russian company to get into mining to compete against bitmain.

After segwit activation the blocksize got removed. Now the 2x part doubles the segwit weightsize, that leaves it with a rough 8mb "blocksize".

Treat bitcoin like stocks and you will loose money.
This is garanteed.
If you invest in btc and hold to it for years to come, you will end up in profit.
Good luck, and remember bitcoin is a protocol like tcp/ip not a company.

trying to break a network worth billions on behalf a few bitcoin companies
@_date: 2017-09-12 05:59:34
Downvoted. What negativity? What are you talking about? I smell from the comments on this thread that you support segwit2x/btc1, and thats fine. But if you watched breacking bitcoin or the dozen of threads open daily here, you see that nobody here supports that corporate crap made behind closed doors, enforcing a contentious hardfork.
Wonder why you get flamed... Get smart.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:53:25
Remove bcash, no one uses that. Besides you contribute to people getting more confused to which bitcoin is what..

Why would you run 10 nodes? One is enough, or maybe two. But the important thing is to use themfor transactions
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:11:58
Not really, hopefully they will let you choose which chain to transact

Diference is you can check the github... All changes need consensus 'ack', otherwise it doesnt go forward.
Your code can be the best , but if doesnt get acks from other devs it doesnt get aproved. There is no rick on bitcoin github repo.

@_date: 2017-10-15 19:37:21
it means nothing having more nodes, what help the no2x movement is using your own node and hold your own keys.
Also using electrum helps.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:22:39
Use android: samourai wallet, or green address  app.
Those use segwit to cut on the fees.
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:52:30
If btc fails you really think btc1/segwit2x will succeed? Please educate yourself. Its will be a shit show and trust loose festival.

Tl;dr move your coins out of these services asap, to non-NYA services.

btc1 github is called that way because it only has one dev, jgarzik.

@_date: 2017-10-10 18:02:49
yes it does if you actually use, more people should do this. Why? because you control the keys/own your own money.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:40:03
not useless. You are sharing the blockchain with other core nodes, miners verify the transactions.
if you use the wallet, you are trusting nobody but yourself, instead other wallets software.
core nodes are the backbone of bitcoin and they have the most secure wallet.

Active on copy pasting changes made by core contributers
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:37:40
sure why not.
the network runs on validators, but people use their own nodes, gives them total control over their bitcoins/keys. Also you make sure that you trust nobody but yourself instead of trusting trezors software or keepkey.
keep in mind there's no other wallet more secure than the reference wallet aka core wallet.

i been watching and that place is indeed a cesspool.
I think the best way to finish them is by keep developing bitcoin core.
That way they will eat their own words in the times to come. Haters gonna hate, most posters there don't even own bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:00:40
Not true. Why are you spreading false information?
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:57:08
@_date: 2016-10-14 12:29:56
Circle is a legit service. You can check the transactions on blockchain.info
@_date: 2016-10-25 01:34:59
A easy way to do this is to tell your friends/family to open accounts at reputable exchanges in their countries.
@_date: 2016-10-17 02:12:48
I was bamboozled
@_date: 2016-10-24 04:28:05
The Core team, some of the devs, have been contributing with code patches and brainstorming discussion for years. And its really incredible how much progress they have been doing on bitcoinscaling videos.
I mean im willing to trust them more, than alternative bitcoin node software devs that want to break the consensus arquitecture.
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:16:27
FUD. Bank like SBI would never touch anything like nChain and craig wright scammester

Is there still one vpn provider service that still doesnt accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-10-03 20:45:11
0 to 15kk bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:57:14
I use "lightning wallet" search it on android store.

Oh okok.
@_date: 2016-10-03 20:30:39
Hmm. Not sure, but now im thinking about the early days faucets. But it shouldn't be more than 500, btc lost in dust.

@_date: 2016-10-24 15:13:10
Well this is now awkard. Usually its the other way, when someone opens a thread like this.
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:21:22
Instead of miners, the pools would join their funds and easily form a 51%, when i mean pools with PoS i mean exchanges
@_date: 2016-10-16 03:04:09
Vultr accepts bitcoin and has ddos protection. Even more so, check out ovh.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:18:14

@_date: 2018-04-10 08:24:53
Look at bch, one mining pool could do a 51% , nobody gives a flying fuck about this and lists them on the exchanges. Having a faal back plan on bitcoin such as LN is a god send
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:36:32
Bcash price feeds on newcomers thinking they are dealing with bitcoin. This is the definition of fraud and deception.
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:49:04


The newcomers must think that unlimited is either a bitcoin generator or another altcoin with bitcoin name attached
@_date: 2016-10-28 02:38:40
Doesnt matter. Even if its a small country of 300k people, it will make other nations to consider bitcoin. By the time iceland is using bitcoin, lightning should be out lol.

Samourai wallet for android, is the most privacy centred wallet there is atm.
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:39:47
btcpay server or your own bitcoind server.
@_date: 2016-10-23 15:35:03
There are other options for android. Such as breadwallet or mycelium. Electrum is mostly for desktops.
@_date: 2016-10-23 15:14:02
Electrum has always been my desktop wallet of choice. They are cross platform, connect directly to electrum servers which run bitcoin nodes, and has advanced features and good fee calculation.
@_date: 2016-10-17 14:41:37
We need a fee market to develop, the sooner the better. Having your transaction recorded in the block is a priviledge, hopefully LN will solve this
@_date: 2016-10-27 11:12:48
The best web wallet should be blockchain.info
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:27:30

I remember something wright... Forgot again.
@_date: 2016-10-23 17:43:09
Wait for a stable version. Or use battletested wallets, for desktop there's always bitcoin core with the blockchain pruned. They actually have a pretty neat wallet.

@_date: 2016-10-08 08:26:27
Right now it has more than enough.
But to ensure decentralization, we need more! 
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:08:32
Also tradeblock.com to check on the network status. Blockchain.info is buggy.
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:08:01
Circle is like a bank. So transfer the bitcoins first to your wallet, and then from the wallet to the betting site.
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:03:56

These are some privacy projects on bitcoin. There are already services that keep making new wallets and shuffling the bitcoins between them, while deleting the old wallets, in order to protect the privacy of their users. example: some gambling websites.

Sorry, i think that was when i said "Satoshi was talking about" thing.
If you think like this: When there's a split/fork the chain with the most PoW is the longest is usually the fork, but if the economic nodes, are on the minority the PoW comes back, because there aren't any fees to mine on the "logest" chain.
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:43:56
Those fees. Damn
@_date: 2017-05-09 01:13:00
core, has a wallet interface for windows, linux and osx. If you are techy enough there are rpc commands to control the wallet, but those are mainly used by exchanges/companies due to their big userbase.
For normal users stick with core wallet interface. 
You can create a new wallet and make a secure backup of it.
I usually make my payments using copay (android wallet), and have a core node (i don't use the wallet), running on vultr (they accept bitcoin payments), just for decentralization reasons.
Any more question shoot it.
edit: 
@_date: 2016-10-27 07:50:50
Over a certain time thats what happens. The new core client is very good at choosing the transactions to verify. We had some bad luck with the Poisson thing, waiting like 1.5hours with the blockchain was backed up.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:45:42
it doesn't work like that.
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:38:19

ask your favorite bitcoin exchange/company to run a BIP148 node. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 01:28:25
I would say electrum or Bitcoin Core with pruned mode (you can choose the blockchain size, minimum is 550Mb i think).
@_date: 2016-10-25 02:21:46
Its a softfork which means that stuff is only added, not actually changed.
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:37:43
no idea, thats the one re-directed on bitcoin.org
@_date: 2016-10-17 15:00:08
How so? If mining gets anymore centralized, pools can censor transactions , like eligius was doing. At least with LN, anyone with funds can run a node including dark web services. Less censorship
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:34:59

Segwit such as Lightning Network, broad support by many suggest that both an increase in the maximum block size and Segwit is the best solution. According to the agreement, a maximum increase of the hard block size range around July 2017. However, questions were raised about the discount fee and suggestions Segwit which will trigger more difficult before onchain scale. Addressing the above Lombrozo said:
I think the opposite is true! Segwit will, for example, allow us to add support for more effective signature systems such as Schnorr transaction sizes that can reduce 30% to 50%, giving us another boost of onchain capabilities.
@_date: 2016-10-18 09:12:56
As in webwallet? Just stored those in a coldwallet. And use blockchain.info for spending.
@_date: 2016-10-28 02:48:39
So any webmoney merchant now can accept bitcoins and get it insta converted to FIAT money?
How many gambling sites accept webmoney and now bitcoin? :D 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:25:08
Use kraken.com , i think they accept scanned documents. Their support is very good, maybe ask them.

Edit: The alternative to avoid verification is using localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:22:35
This is both wrong and true.

running core you help the backbone of the bitcoin network stay decentralized and also you control your own wallet. but you can for instance use electrum which is spv (connects to bitcoin core nodes).

I would recommend, to send it to electrum and then to a exchange (for example poloniex), and then withdraw again to electrum. The tumblers adresses are most likely blacklisted by circle.
Why a exchange? If you are asked any questions just say you are a btc trader.

Miners will keep mining even at a loss, because they know that if the network slows down aka blocks are found slower. It will mean slower transactions and slower transactions will mean, a lower price. 
Thats my take what is going to happen. It will be beatiful to watch.

You are a example for us all. Truly.
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:02:11
check this twitter 
this guy has deposited 2M $ on kraken. So it shouldn't a problem for you, with a tier 4 account.
@_date: 2016-05-19 03:56:51
expedia also accepts it.
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:14:47
If in this day a year ago we were in a bubble, what are we in today?
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:02:22
saved this one, and will use it when needed.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:10:25
Then, what are those reasons he's talking about for you to agree?
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:41:20
I sent them a go fuck yourselfs, they verified fully my accout in minutes, strange.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:53:13

@_date: 2017-05-20 00:36:14
when i say tested, i mean segwit level tested.
none of those bips, got the type of testing segwit got, plus do they really solve anything besides raising the blocksize?
what is your bitcoin exit strategy?
@_date: 2016-05-24 20:26:06
Ups. xd
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:18:29
This is so epic, needs more upvotes

HODL THE DOOR
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:16:06
Run a uasf node.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:47:27
This is good news everyone!
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:04:25
Careful where you exchange. You might be scammes, use bitsquare.
I for one, wont be doing anything, not even worth imo.
@_date: 2015-10-26 03:09:47
How many body guards?
@_date: 2016-05-31 18:22:00
Remember to send you the bitcoins to your personal wallet, and then to bovada. Because sending directly from Circle or Coinbase, will get your(circle or coinbase) account locked, due to gambling rules.
TL;DR mix your bitcoins the best you can, before sending to bovada. Circle &amp; Coinbase anti-gambling rules sux.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:43:13
That is true, but a node needs also means you control your own keys/coins
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:20:08
hey I remember your post :D
still got any of those pics to show us? :D
edit: please tell us you are mining on slush pool, or any other segwit ready pool :p
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:10:11
Today was a good day for hodlers, better days to come!
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:03:39
soon yes.

Fixed xd
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:56:14
Good one too!
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:25:26
Again with this hardfork stuff. Hardforks cannot happen when they are contentious. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 02:53:53
Just buy from localbitcoins.

@_date: 2017-07-17 13:42:39
Theres f2pool and btcc and slush left to signal
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:08:33
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:24:05
Let me know if I can help you OP
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:42:18
genesistrading or kraken
@_date: 2017-05-03 01:15:51
killed it!
@_date: 2016-07-12 03:48:56
you mean 2-auth codes?
if yes, it might be a glitch from xapo, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-17 20:08:45
I will buy it. PM me :p
@_date: 2016-07-18 04:34:58
No. Just import it to electrum, and then send it to kraken.
@_date: 2016-07-05 02:15:32
Set it to dynamic fees. Everybody should do this!
Otherwise if you manually input the fees and get them wrong, it might take a while for them to get in a block.
Without fees, the network might not even relay the bitcoins aka they wont be transfered to another address.
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:18:07
downvoted since its from bitcoin.com altcoins promoter website.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:50:58
This is history!
See you all in the 3th halvening to 6.25btc / block !
@_date: 2016-05-12 03:51:33
Use electrum to sweep the private key
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:50:49
HI! I was here. Such a epic moment.
Cheers to another million!
@_date: 2015-10-06 04:20:48
He said parlay so im guessing hes betting at nitrogensports
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:29:14
Good song to listen to during the lock-in: 
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:37:34
Guys don't use coinbase... its just a matter of time before they fuck up big time.
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:05:47


just wait a bit for it to be fixed, or maybe try to add you country start number, mine is +351(Portugal)XXXXXXX(rest of the number)
@_date: 2016-07-19 04:53:39
This guy is a clown. He can't even get coinbase running smoothly.
Brian keep asking in twitter... Im sure someone will find a scaling solution just for you.
@_date: 2016-07-08 04:37:27
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:34:37
Three-fiddy i think
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:51:24
Also lntip withdrawn &lt;3
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:43:56
@_date: 2016-07-07 03:44:10
Use mycelium
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:41:31
Twitter search: craig wright,  should give you a couple recent results
@_date: 2016-07-07 03:41:43
Using circle you have to follow circle rules.
I would suggest you to withdraw the bitcoins, to a bitcoin wallet you control, such as mycelium or copay, and then spend it from there, to anywhere you want.
Why? Because if you withdraw directly from circle to ie: A gambling website and circle knows its a gambling website... It will lock you and you will have to contact the support to retrieve your money.
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:24:17
@_date: 2017-06-22 01:08:32
None.  Most are clones or centralized. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:33:35
Google blockchain pruning.
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:58:57
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:01:43
Satoshi would represent a central point of failure. Thats the reason he wont appear. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:56:04
RemindMe! 4 years
need to confirm.
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:49:54
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:42:54
Have you been living under a rock? Majority of non-mining users want segwit. Miners are stalling it because of the saucy fees that they are ripping, and ASICBoost exploit.
@_date: 2016-07-24 17:18:18
This is actually a vunerability lol
@_date: 2016-07-08 04:28:18
Totally this.
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:15:16
Xapo isnt really a wallet but a broker. 
Try kraken, gemini or check the sidebar for more exchanges. 
And install a wallet where you control your own keys (you are ur own bank) check those wallets at bitcoin.org
@_date: 2016-07-15 02:14:42
Im not sure, but i think bitcoin core 0.13 will come out with a option in GUI, to insta-bump the fee.
Also electrum.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:57:21
Again... core doesn't get to decide anything they are not a company.
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:15:28
Dude...  Just freeze your account... 
Then contact support. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:10:23
Ethereum is going to implode, people are too greedy and don't see what they are buying into.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:35:15
R/btc wants to centralize bitcoin and pumps altcoins
Roger Ver owns bitcoin.com and r/btc and is bitcoins worst enemy.
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:58:43
maybe activate segregated witness? Its not the core, its the miners!
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:31:57
Trezor - hardware
Electrum - software
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:59:04
Jihad Wu asked for this BIP a long time ago. Now its here, either he signals or gets booted.
This BIP if adopted gets us safely to deploy UASF and is also compatible with BIP 148.

"Results show that SegWit is the clear winner with 71% of the respondents selecting this option as their preferred solution." your point?
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:22:10
well... there's this 
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:17:36
you prefer action from core where billions of $ are on the blockchain?
Dude bitcoin aren't your regular stocks regulated by gov. Many people dont get that and end up mad, if they dont get rich quick. Bitcoin is currency.
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:14:17
Im loving the sound, watching.
@_date: 2016-07-05 02:18:15
Unless you mix it with coinjoin aka joinmarket
@_date: 2016-07-24 17:19:27
People are downvoting this why?

Thank you Bitsquare looking to do a couple trades there now :D
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:09:38
Roger Ver owns rbtc and bitcoin.com you usually can see him pumping altcoins and shitcoins from both sites. 
He pays a few people to promote altcoin, and talk bad things about core devs. 
Here we talk about bitcoin and the convos are actually good. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:10:05
Thank you I think this was the final piece of the puzzle to make BIP148 safe.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:50:58
Core does not have "representatives", and its not a company. Its a loose bunch of developers contributing mostly on github.
Its fucked up that they either dont understand this, after all these years, or they want to control the narrative which is useless.
@_date: 2016-07-18 14:21:21
Jonasschnelli did
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:54:07
Its also important to keep it running at least until september!
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:41:37
Because we are talking about people's money... You surely don't want  a CS undergrad making commits to bitcoin github don't you?
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:03:54
There is more game theory behind forks and softforks than you can think of. Not that easy.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:17:30
@_date: 2016-07-15 03:43:03
Thanks for the confirmation.
