When you give someone bitcoin, it's generally good practice to add a "miner fee" to incentivize miners to verify your transaction. Whoever solves the block gets all the associated transaction fees along with the 25BTC reward. This fee isn't required, but if don't include it, they will generally choose to verify transactions that do before looking at yours. 
In the future, the value of these voluntary fees will hopefully be enough to keep miners going. After all, miners don't have to verify your transaction and will simply choose not to verify transactions with no fee leaving them in limbo.

I used Bitcoin to buy a fireproof safe from them to protect my backup drives . A month after, I got a second safe for some reason. I called to ask how to return it. They gave me a shipping label.

But people could fathom the automobile (especially since it existed for years before Ford was able to make it cheap enough for wide adoption), and where the roads were good enough, they were very popular and quickly adopted.
Even if they weren't widely adopted, a fabricated quote is proof of nothing. 
How about:


~Thomas Watson
This quote from a man who died in 1956 demonstrates that even the CEO of IBM had no idea how important computers are and how they would revolutionize the world. 
Unfortunately, there's no evidence that he ever said this. The earliest citation is from the 80s when computers were already revolutionizing the world. 
If you like the Ford quote, feel free to make up quotes for anything you feel is important.

They do when you're talking about digital things.  Bitcoins do take some small amount of bandwidth to transmit, so you can equate anything digital to the size of a Bitcoin transaction.
Of course, the value of a particular byte of transaction isn't the least bit constant, but it's still a unit.


Though I suspect that very, very few things will be worth their bandwidth in BTC, even for small transaction amounts.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:20:58
The iffy thing there is that you can't automate transactions straight from USD to outside accounts.  Purchases go to Coinbase wallets first.
Due to price fluctuations, it's not really possible to automate purchasing $X worth of Bitcoin and sending the same amount of Bitcoin 4 days later.

They can decide how high a fee has to be before they'll accept it. How much is paid is set by the spender. 
If a miner sets their limit much higher than zero though, they'll be throwing away essentually free money. The incremental cost of including a transaction is basically zero. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:10:39
I didn't "chose not to pay". I used the client's default settings which I assumed calculated transaction fees based on the widely accepted algorithm and determined that one was not required for this transaction.
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:16:05
Whatever solution we come up with will still have to handle income tax witholding, 401k contributions, health insurance, etc.  It's not as simple as just paying out in BTC.
My hope is that I can come up with some sort of system where employees can opt in and set a fixed dollar amount, have ADP combine those amounts and send them lump-sum to some bank account, and then have a third-party buy BTC with that lump-sum and divvy it up as specified to each employee.

No it isn't. We don't even know that people wanted "faster horses". The point of the quote is "the biggest obstacle to human progress is humans", but we don't know if that was really the case in Ford's time.  The only reason the quote carries any weight is because Ford "said" it, but if he didn't, it's just a case of modern people casting their own prejudices on history and making up events that support their agenda/opinion. 
If you want to show that people tend to shun the adoption of new technology that will ultimately make their lives easier, put in the effort and find an *actual* example of this. If you can't, adjust your opinion to model the facts.

The speed of light changes due to the index of refraction of a medium which is the square root of the product of the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of that material.
For air, the refractive index is very close to 1, but in water or glass, it slows down dramatically.  This is what makes things look weird underwater and what allows lenses to work.

Note that when you use a credit card, the cash takes nearly a **month** to actually show up in your hands.
There are a number of services for managing bitcoin transactions that can speed them up.  Look up Bitpay.  Transactions "verify" in a number of seconds.
Bitpay charges merchant fees which cover insurance for merchants against double-spending attacks.  They also have a number of machines in the network that look for attempted double-spends before they're actually verified by the bitcoin network.  If there's any suspicion of fraud, it's caught within seconds and the transaction is rejected.

Thanks for the feedback!  Would you rather have the hole off to the side?  Given the materials, I couldn't put the hole diagonally in line with the corner, but I could have it asymmetrically off to one side probably.
$20 is a little light for the effort involved, but again, if I optimized my production, the material costs are negligible (enough aluminum for 12 units costs $2.82 and the can of spray paint was like $3.50).

I did try that version (I was up until 2:30am clicking on things last night).
My problem was that it was working, but kept getting CPU GPU mismatches.

So every reasonable consumer decides to sell their mining equipment because it's unprofitable.  Isn't bitcoin in a dire situation if nobody wants to mine? Who's going to verify transactions?

I don't know the details, but I was told that they're using a service that looks for attempts at double spending in the network and immediately cancels if it finds one.  The incentive for the double spender is to get their second transaction out into the network as fast as possible, so you shouldn't have to wait too long.
If one gets through anyway, the merchant gets paid anyway using money from service fees.

My first attempt was .25mm per pass, but my travel speed was wayyy too high and obliterated my bit in an instant. After that, I was a little over cautious (only two weeks until Christmas after all).
Next time around, I'm going to use a proper calculator to set my speed as high as I can.

I've done that before.  Another solution that I've had some success with is double-sided tape on wood (after you mill down the wood flat).  For very slow passes, it actually does a decent job of holding everything down.  You have a lot of surface area to work with for a temporary adhesive.

The only way I think I could increase durability would be to make them out of steel or another metal stronger than aluminum. 
Streamlining is a little difficult, because by it's very nature, each QR code has to be unique, so it's going to be 2 hours of CNC work each at the very least (as opposed to faster methods like injection molding, etc).
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:35:22
If my customers were entirely bitcoin users, you might have a point. 
I agree that bitcoin can be easier, but claiming it already is simply incorrect.
Also, how do you know that malware hasn't injected a qr code into the page you're viewing? at least Visa has fraud prevention.

As smeg4brains said, it really wasn't awkward.  He made a point of explaining a lot of what he was doing, but all he really had to do was hang the iPad out for me to scan.  I suspect once the novelty wears off, they'll treat it like any other transaction.
Also, considering my credit card always takes 2-3 tries on a Square reader, it was relatively painless.

My cousin left her friend's car illegally parked for all of 3 minutes and got it towed.  She needed $250 to get it back, and it was already 10pm.  She was hoping to get it back before the car's owner woke up, but was totally broke (end of the semester).
She called to ask to borrow money and I ended up moneygramming her $250 which cost $25 in transaction fees and took two hours.

Figure I'll adjust the price every few weeks. Besides, material costs are less than a dollar, so I'd only be losing time if BTC tanks, and I'm learning a skill in the process. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:44:51
Yeah, it's pretty sturdy.  I suspect the paint will chip off over time (maybe less so after I clear-coat it), but it can easily be re-painted and sanded down to look good as new at any point.
$100 is falling more in line with the labor cost.  Considering being one of the brave few to lock the price in BTC (for a few weeks at a time) and taking my chances.

What's that one that parks in front of City Hall and serves burgers to drunkards?
I loved going to that place.  Especially because it was a walk-in truck and Providence is freezing in the winter.

Assuming you're not erecting your own towers, you're still buying time off a major carrier's network. How d you know it's secure?

I was planning to re-buy at 300.  Bummer it didn't quite make it down that low.

They didn't say which number I was, but I'm guessing their bitcoin customer base has grown rapidly over the past week based on [this tweet](

QRs have redundancy built in, so it doesn't matter. Try covering up the corner with a thumb. It's amazing mow much you can get away with. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:49:24
Nope. QRs have a ton of error correction built in. You can cover the whole corner with a thumb, and it will still work fine.

It more or less is that, but that's still difficult when compared to more traditional methods of manufacturing.  This takes at least 2 hours of machine time per unit, and there really isn't a way to make that any faster, so I can only make so many units per day.  Couple that with the fact that I can't stock-pile them before accepting orders as each is made-to-order.
I was thinking $50/ea is probably as low as I'd be willing to go, but I'd need to hammer out a few more before settling on a price.

I'm considering buying an anodizing kit. I etch my own PCBs, and the chemicals aren't much worse. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:57:55
Can't though unless people trust me with their private keys which they would be stupid to do.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:56:11
That's beautiful!
Wish I had a bench grinder :( though I wonder how hard it would be to scan a mirror finish QR code. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:24:46
QR codes have a ton of redundancy and validation checks.  It's virtually impossible to deform a QR code enough to create another valid QR code.
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:15:14
Hey thanks!
And yeah, it's his public key (wouldn't post here otherwise!). I was considering doing a private key too, but I'm a little paranoid about security considering the number of steps involved.

Still have to precisely separate them.  Not super easy as it's difficult to hold the pieces when you have to cut them out like that.

I think my app can do that with fairly low effort.  The more painstaking part is re-inserting the tool and re-zeroing it.  Might just be easier to let it run its course.  At least I don't need to be there to watch it.

I ordered a polishing kit for my Dremel, but I'm afraid that the sharp edges might chew up the cloth wheel.

Cambam already does that for me.

I'm just getting started with the CNC, and rectangular shapes are much simpler to deal with.  I could probably make something like that, but if it needed to be on a corner, I'd need to get some wider aluminum stock to start with as my current stock is only barely wide enough to fit the code as it is.
