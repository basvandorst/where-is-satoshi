I would think that is likely an overlooked law that is never ever enforced though. MMOs like EVE have their own currency, buyable with any foreign currency and freely exchangeable by the market. Is it illegal to offer things for things other than dollars? How about gift cards? Gift cards are technically not dollars either. And also, foreign currency exchange places technically let you buy dollars with yen, for example. Is it illegal that you buy dollars with things other than dollars?
"Buy" is a very ill-defined term anyways. It is just barter in which one item is called a currency.

Mining bitcoins can also make your computer into a space heater.
The thing is that, gold is worth *way* more than its limited uses warrant. Lead has similar uses, but is much less expensive.

Yes, the only reason why bitcoin has value is because it is rare (mining is sloooooow and yields finite amounts of bitcoin). Just like gold. What is gold backed with? ;)

But why do we desire gold? Because it is rare. When aluminium was rare, it was considered much more precious than gold or silver. Wikipedia: "Napoleon III of France is reputed to have given a banquet where the most honoured guests were given aluminium utensils, while the others made do with gold."
Gold is obviously useful in electronics, but that does not justify its price. For me, chrome on steel looks much better than gold for jewelry.

Backed by nothing in the sense that gold is backed by nothing. Bitcoin is inherently valuable; it is not an IOU that needs backing.

Neither is the Chinese yuan legal currency in the US, but very very legal to use if the merchant accepts it.

I don't even live in the US.

COMMUNISTS WILL WIN THE WORLD OF BITCOIN! REGULATE EVERYTHING!
Oh wait, Communists are people too...

No, that is a misunderstanding. "Legal tender" means that it *must be accepted for dollar-denominated debt*. For example, you cannot advertise accepting dollars, and only accept cheques.
This comes back in the day of gold standards where a "dollar" was a unit of gold. The "legal tender" means that merchants can't demand gold, but must treat the paper money as he would treat a dollar of gold.
All this has nothing to do with unofficial currencies like Bitcoin, as nobody is pegging Bitcoin to dollars, and prices are marked in Bitcoin.

Yes, if you convince enough people to treat it as money.

Huh? Everything that is not illegal is automatically legal under all jurisdictions. Do you expect lawmakers to make gigantic lists of "legal things to do"? Obviously not.
