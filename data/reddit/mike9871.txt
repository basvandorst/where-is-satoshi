Sucks for weak hands tho
We tend to recover fast
Gotta wait for Korea to allow crypto
Heard it was on the 20th on January 
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:28:22
THIS COOL
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:39:30
How much do these sell for? I know what I said but I been wanting to grab at least 1 btc miner. I have a dash miner need a btc miner
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:36:38
I'm sure coinbase will give you the 40k but at its current Bitcoin price 
I assume you bought at dip������������
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:39:03
Bank? To exchange? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:05:15
No fud
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:46:18
Well for Bitcoin to drop this much must mean lots of weak hands out there
I see the market going up again middle of this year(summertime, tends to happen) people want cheap coins, right now is a good time, maby even next week it drops 
This happens at 9k as well
If I remember correctly market was at 9k but dropped to 7.5 or 8.5 k
Something like that. Then came a rise
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:33:30
I heard something about stopping trades for while but if they never left then OKproably wanted cheap coins
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:07:08
Send to avoid taxes

Coinbase is an ass
I buy coins and then they say
" buys may be down for a while" NOT WHAT THEY say but something like that
I bought some eth and ltc before The pumps and coinbase just cancels the buy after 4 days
When I check I see my buy is gone and coins are pumped
SOO MAD WITH COINBASE 
They just say
It's cuz high network traffic and blahhblaah blahh 
I don't trust them one bit, I still get my coins here cuz I have no other option
They even said that they would hire lots of people and more tech team to prevent this and seams like there's still problems
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:21:49
Would have been smart idea
Then on dip you buy and you have more coins than before
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:16:42
It's legal and irs won't know I traded
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:04:26
Bitmain needs to stop making antminer s9
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:36:27
I thought they liked crypto?
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:30:05
I heard 20 of Jan 
But right now it's all rumers 
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:37:21
What do you think would happen if satoshi nakamoto came out of no where and said sell because Bitcoin is going to die???
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:09:18
Go to coinbase buy ltc send to binance or exchange and buy altxoins worth around 100-500 sats and wait 6 months or year and see the GAINS
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:07:02
What will happen once 90% is mined?
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:37:58
Always seams to rise every summer or near that time, it's when most have cash to sped for summer, I predict a rise . Can't say what exact time because the market is toxic rn 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:37:07
With the help of Reddit community it's easy to find info, how did people find out about the bans??
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:14:33
You can hold btc on a tezor 
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:07:46
Pretty much. The price may drop a lot due to people in USA already done taxes or people dumping btc into altcoins
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:44:35
The only thing that burst was bitconnect, check out the graph
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:29:32
Seams like fud 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:39:02
Sign what? To allow crypto?
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:04:03
I ditched Bitcoin at 18k I knew massive sell of was coming. Long term holders sold at 19-20k
It drops once you see the lambo posts
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:22:17
Where moon?

Bread wallet app?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:39:36
Is it really. My mining stopped during night
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:47:26
It depends on the tx value stuff
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:48:13
Don't think just invest, my friend said drop and he missing out he has no coins but I do
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:48:37
Same I told my friends to buy when it was 11.5k and he keeps saying no and that it's going to crash and I think he felt kinda sad today when Bitcoin went up around 2k in 1 day
(I bought when 3800 and 11.5)
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:42:57
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:46:16
Your late late as in late to the rise
But I do coinbase. It's simple anyone can use it
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:24:00
But the hacked chance is really low
Very unlucky that nice hash was "hacked"
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:53:03
We here soo many stories like this
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:19:21
You make good points
Just buy btc instead .��������$$$$$$
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:55:54
Might be because there's going to be huge sell off soon
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:02:44
With the price going up like this I don't know if I should sell when it starts to dip or hodl. Really hard decision because if I sell I get $$ and rebut dip but if I hold.the price could drop a lot
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:23:16
Can't wait for that Lamborghini
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:48:08
I mine with antminer d3 and it profits 200 depending on the difficulty at max I could make 250-300
Uses less that 1000kwh 
I'm going to buy antminer when next batch is released
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:38:32
Jp Morgan said that and he got
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:25
Yeah he is

GET THE 16k memes ready it's coming fast
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:08:27
Why would people invest in that? Unless you pay them in btc, don't see how btc futures will affect Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:44:59
Not sure how their pay system works because it seams like it's changed
In a week I will know if I made the estimated ammount
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:39:02
Really late like 12 hrs late
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:41
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:54:29
Same after correction there's the slow rise
And I will buy more bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:34:12
Probably. If it goes really low and btc drop may mean a dip
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:35:56
I made one with sheets, just put down your btc amount and the price you think it will reach to and done it's really easy to do
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:58:20
What is Bitcoin futures anyways. How does that work
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:55:58
Can't buy Bitcoin if under 18
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:29:27
Unless the hacker sells 60k worth of btc
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:20:13
It never reached 19k that's just gdax selling to high
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:44:25
They don't need to regulate that's what irs is for
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:49:32
But with the price going up there's going to be a point where the bill is too much. I going to probably run 2 d3 3 s9. I have a d3 that's just my plan for 2k18
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:44:13
What if there just fixing? I don't believe this
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:43:04
No I have my bitcoins bought before price went up soo high 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:03:47
Thank nicehash
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:36:19
Is this all planned?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:26:30
A miner will make you more than if you hodl for months
In the end you can sell the miner
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:48:25
Everyone just scared  that it won't go up so there selling. But good thing. If it drops people buy. There's always a 1 minute drop and rise right after most of time
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:03:56
That's like me
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:21:25
I been into Bitcoin from when it was $200 I was just a miner. But the mining stuff was too much work so I sold. The. This summer it was up so I bought
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:59:49
Ok then go buy a expensive bitmain miner
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:37:49
How much you pay per kWh?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:23:39
Don't understand that link
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:36:04
Open Bitcoin app that computer.
Download block chain 
Go to coinbase and send to a receiving adress on the Bitcoin app
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:44:16
I'm not sure what the price is, only see Avalon 6 for 500 on a mining hardware reviews  Avalon 6 3.5 th
I think there's a 7.5 version
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:36:18
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:46:41
Just bought 450 while coinbase priced Bitcoin cheaper than coinmarketcap
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:36:25
Get a miner s9 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:52:03
Yeah now that price is high people won't sell so recklessly 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:41:32
I keep mine text document on multiple usb and sd cards in my house. (1 sd card 1 usb)
Incase one fails or gets destroyed
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:38:49
I can't till coinbase puts my funds in
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:00:15
Tuesday I get my usd deposit so anywhere 14-15k btc price good for mei made mistake instead of buy btc when it was 11.5k I shouldn't have done coinbase usd deposite
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:45:12
I got 450$ yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:50:39
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:53:35
Why would it crash 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:02:12
To move4440 I paid 6$
Edit it was when unconfirmed transactions were 200k
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:59:03
Depends on difficulty
And I do nice hash and it topically pays lower than mining the coin
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:57:01
This legit?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:36:05
You can't unless you buy a miner . You need to be 18 to buy bitcoins
@_date: 2018-09-15 10:05:26
Only if the bill is more than half of can piece it all togeter
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:45:35
Antminer s9 doesn't use that much energy. At my cost 
In USA I think foreveyone the price goes up 2 cents after 1000kwh
I can tell you for sure when I get home
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:00:17
It's not on a pc its external memory that gets disconnected 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:21
Same story I hear from lots of people and I tell that story too. Should have bought back in 2013
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:05:00
Would it be better to buy on gdax then on coinbase. That way I can set a price level
(Both same people, but gdax I can set the priceij want it bought)
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:55:48
It's probably locked if you have not been on for a good amount of time. To protect funds. Email support or your profile was getting hacked and they blocked it till you confirm identity 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:16:02
I pad a little more money than you to transfer a lot more
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:34:16
Their support take forever
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:42:45
When it dips does it decline instant or slowly? And when it dips is it when there's more selling than people buying 
Just interested because I bought Bitcoin low, so if it dips too much I would still make profit when j sell. Just want to maximize my earnings.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:15:11
You can avoid this if you send me bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:49:38
Did you happen to have around  2500 btcs deposited this week?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:50
The dude who got 60k btc from nice hash hacker
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:21:18
I think it's safe but it's safer to have a wallet
Only for the private keys
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:56
For dip we would need to have the longtime holders sell but it won't drop Much and it will recover
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:13:17
No gpu mining what lies
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:01:13
Veryyyyy weird how the steal coins at the start of the rise. They probably not and when it dips they gonna be like we recovered  them some $h!t like that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:53:37
Yeah rn you shouldn't move coins
There is about 120k unconfirmed transactions
But this could have changed from last time I checked
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:02:53
You know if you buy it increases price. Tell your friends to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:36:49
He could copy the file that has his btc
Or add another drive and clone
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:41:20
Same here, I have ledger but I still don't trust it because them scams
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:15:50
They just want to steal money. Why freez for being "suspects"
@_date: 2018-05-28 03:56:30
So Bitcoin gone?

Doing this so you don't have to take everything. Better for it to be donated that to be paid to goverment
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:03:00
You should ask for a small load of 1m $ from your parents and buy the dip.
(Ps I sorta did that, but I was 18 except I don't have public record so it couldn't be verified so I used my bro and I just use my bank, he has to tax it �� if earnings are over 20k, I think )
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:40:34
And is it trusted site
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:26:31

Tia Lopez scam artist
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:31:11
Because of this market will dip because of this guy, OMG look what you done 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:32:23
Oak just asking question, price goes down difficulty up, they might have something to do with each other but if you say no then ok 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:01:05
Your right cuz every time weak hands sell(not you) there's always a pump
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:22:43
Sell at dip your only option
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:33:05
Bitcoin will roughly go to 7-8k but this will take some time and lots of fudders 
I have my sources
