But wouldn't you agree that it will lead to centralized hubs that could potentially require KYC if located in the US? Even though there is technically no custody, it still creates a central point of failure that can be shut down fairly easily if needed. I still haven't heard a convincing argument against this other than the nodes will end up being located in favorable jurisdictions

I am surprised there is no single mention of this change on r/bitcoin.

Not at all. Merchants will always seek a service that will hedge their volatility risk. Most merchants never want to touch cryptocurrencies directly because of volatility

You know that the guy that was accused of "insider trading" actually wasn't the one that made the comments right? It wasn't even related to the incident in January but to an unrelated regulation in December.  He made a profit of $6600 and everyone here is claiming that he somehow made millions. Moreover, he said that he was on vacation and was unaware of the news when he made the trade

You don't think LN will lead to large hubs? Of course every user can act as one but the channel needs to be loaded with a lot of BTC, which regular people won't be able to do. It will tend to be the BTC whales or organizations

Distributed Ledger Technology. Pretty much another word for blockchain but normally used for enterprises

Yea, I agree.

Yes. Why would they?

Investment banks are really good at hedging their risks
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:26:04
Yea exactly. 
Poloniex, Coinbase, Blockstream, Kraken and Bitwala deal with Bitcoin directly.

That's true except VC investments have at least some obligations to the investors. Most of these projects raised hundreds of millions from smaller investors and they are not even doing as much as communicating regularly with the public. What's their excuse of not hiring enough PR people?
