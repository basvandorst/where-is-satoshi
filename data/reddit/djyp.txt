I was actually thinking about that and wondering if that would work, thanks!  Nice to have someone more knowledgeable validate an idea.

Has anyone found anything?  I'm still searching as well.
edit: I'm getting "org.bitcoin.production" following the guide at 
I'm hesitant on using the "RECOVERING FROM PROTOBUF WALLET FORMAT" method in that guide as it seems like it requires using another wallet and I'm not sure what that does as far as accessing my bitcoin cash.  anyone else know?

so it seems that that method involves adding your bitcoin to the bitcoinj wallet. did you then extract you private keys from that? and were you able to use those private keys for bitcoincash assuming that you did this process with bitcoin you held in the wallet prior to the fork and did this process after the fork?

Did you end up using the "RECOVERING FROM PROTOBUF WALLET FORMAT" method?

I see. I figured as much but was hoping otherwise so that I could have the solution I was looking for. Thanks.

I'm holding off until I  know more.  I have no idea how any of this works tbh and I'm fine leaving everything where it is right now. My concern is that transferring bitcoin now would ultimately change something making it so that I can't access the bcc side of things. So I'm waiting to learn more before I unwittingly do something that is potentially irreversible. 
I would definitely welcome any help and appreciate the assistance you've already given. 
So basically I transferred bitcoin to the wallet prefork from Coinbase because at the time they weren't going to support BCC and I read somewhere that you could access your private keys with this wallet.   
So the questions I have is would opening the decrypted backup in bitcoinj give me access to the same prefork private key that I could then use to claim the BCC?
edit: accidentally posted before I was done.
And part 2 of the question is Original can I transfer it now postfork from bitcoinj to another wallet to claim the BCC?

That makes a lot of sense, and while I won't say I understand everything, my primary concern due to my ignorance was   if loading the wallet backup in bitcoinj somehow altered things which I feel better about now and at this point I think I've got it. I do appreciate your  willingness to inform the ignorant. Thanks!

I want to get my private keys in order to use them for bitcoincash.

That was me too thanks!
