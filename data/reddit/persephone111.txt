Is it a better investment right now to hold BTC or ETH?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:46:52
yep- I wish someone had told me this shit earlier. Took me like a day to figure out you dont do it from CB
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:02:25
selling or moving are both taxable gains, but gains are not a high percentage 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:15:17
thanks, I just mean if let's say you just mine for one company, do they pay into your bank account or send you a check or paypal or something? And do they require your social? I'm wondering over the specifics of how the IrS is fucked from getting your gains...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:33:23
Are there eels and reclusive daughters involved?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:17:03
some "arguments" don't require counterarguments because they're aggressively absurd. Downgrade your arrogance-it is not deserved.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:20:16
ok, I just thought they looked similar. There was recently a murder near me where a biker wearing the lightning symbol killed some random lady in a drive-by.

@_date: 2017-12-01 09:26:36
It still amazes me how puritanical some people are. I bet your coworker comes from a religious background? My mom too, very, very sensitive about things like debt ("usury") and investing "gambling". You're just supposed to labor, labor, labor all your days away, don't question, don't innovate, and don't (above all) have fun. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:21:30
I don't think it is, that's an urban myth. Not if you catch it directly from rainfall like in barrels. For those taking runoff they need to refill aquifers or reservoirs, it's a different story.

That is all.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:04:59
Ah okay- in that respect yes it could be currently in a bubble, but I dont think one as large as maybe a eek or month worth of gain. We already lost the extra exponential gain over the past week, Id say thats likely the "bubble" and would call it a correction really.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:16:24

omg go over to r/BTC it's hilarious...all the talk about is BCH as if BTC doesnt even exist anymore. I once asked them why they never talk about Bitcoin and like 20 people were immediately all like "we only talk about bitcoin here and you're crazy". It's a flawless troll.

@_date: 2017-12-18 01:33:44
Well it's really the media mis-communicating pretty valid ideas, namely that a "hypermasculine" or let's even say "patriarchal" environment attracts more sociopaths and bullies than other sectors do- would that make more sense?
 You're absolutely right, "male-dominated" is okay and not the problem; to complain about something being male-dominated is inherently misandrist. The actual problem is the toxic, asshole behavior within the finance sector which are actions wilfully engaged in by individuals who are usually male but always total assholes. Regardless of gender- the behavior is the problem here, not the gender. Warren indubitably is correct in calling the BEHAVIOR out but the article (typical MSM) twists her words a bit for the (clickbait) headline and makes it seem like she's being a misandrist SJW but her points are fair and asking consideration for women.

Hey man...thanks for electing Trump btw
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:16:18
this is common sense. This person said they put in $50. Someone reminded him to "move it to a hardware/paper wallet" which requires he will have to buy one, which costs about $70 or so. You do the math. It's $50 ffs.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:38:02
Ledger Nano SILLY!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:25:14
well guys let's be logical here: you're really arguing apples and oranges. The first speaker didn't specify "narrow field" in describing how to learn; the second assumed he meant any wide field and rebuts; first speaker clarifies but not enough and second ignores the clarification and continues his criticism. Typical trend of online argumentation. Ultimately apples and oranges. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:34:41
In a word? Yes.  Coinbase is for beginners. You then graduate to the more complicated GDAX :D
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:33:13
I got that feeling too LOL
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:06
it'll be back- no worries. Prolly a market correction now, sell later hen it does hit $20K. I'm HODLing til then
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:42:39
That's what I keep thinking :D
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:27:58
meh- we're immediately back to right where we were preceding the super-fast rise, as usual. Almost $18K
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:07:28
that website is spam or something
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:20
LOL 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:46:10
right- I think i get it now. From Coinbase, yes. It's just a shame, although apparently GDAX says they're soon going to get out a free instant option to fastlane the 3-5 day ACH deposits
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:17:41
I hate Trump but I love you.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:42:34
literally exactly what I keep saying!!! Simply kinks that will "work themselves out" over time
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:57:07
so all the information that you relied on was from the exact same source? Sounds like propaganda to me, are you selling something?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:55:05
I think the talking heads just are at a loss what to say at this point, even for them.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:22:25
But people mostly use credit cards today for most purchases and there are associated fees, though usually absorbed by the merchant. In the future, society will start adapting to the technology by reducing fees and that's when widespread use of BTC as a currency will happen. Wait for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:09:23

If you were one you'd be kicked from the club right away because you're a cheap and disrespectful fuck :D
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:20:22
I'm wondering once you deposit USD funds from bank account into GDAX, here is there a record of it? Shouldn't there be one in the Accounts or Orders headers or will it not show up there until the funds have been credited?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:26:30
Haha lol..not really.  :D
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:03:15
GDAX! the same as CB but no fees. right now though you have to wait like 3 days for your account to be funded so you can buy..but it's free (or very very cheap I forgot

"As we can see, by early 1921 the mark’s value had stabilised in terms of dollars. Then after the May 1921 London Ultimatum the catastrophic depreciation began, which was a fundamental driver of the hyperinflation.
It was only after May 1921 and the currency depreciation that run-away inflation occurred as well, as we can see in the German wholesale price index graph below"
the reason for the appreciation wasnt consumer psychology as it is with Bitcoin, it was the depreciation of the German paper mark (analogy here being the USD) with which the new gold mark (BTC) is being measured. In our case, the USD is stable. Bad analogy.

From October 24th: "In our prior blog post we indicated that at the time of the fork, the existing chain will be called Bitcoin and the Segwit2x fork will be called Bitcoin2x.
However, some customers asked us to clarify what will happen after the fork. We are going to call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin.
We will make a determination on this change, once we believe the forks are in a stable state. We may consider other factors such as market cap or community support to determine stability."
Then yesterday: "Last week, the Segwit2x development team announced they would no longer continue with the project. In addition, a significant portion of miners and other community leaders withdrew their support for the fork. However, despite these developments, a small number of miners may attempt to go forward with a fork."
Which sent BTC skyrocketing.

I know it's completely the wrong time. A week from the day he sold (yesterday) Bitcoin will be like 30% higher maybe. If he's buying a mortgage with it, he was HODLing a large amount- so the amount of interest he just lost by not waiting a WEEK to buy a stupid (bad investment and unnecessary, by the way) mortgage must be pretty.damn.massive.

LOL! In all truth though, the issue has always been the sort of imbalance of how they are taxing the working poor up to the middle class. The working class through middle-middle class are the ones struggling who they need to reduce taxes for, and the upper middle class to higher, are the ones they should tax more.  This also becomes more complicated according to what part of the country you live in specifically (cost of living easily puts an upper class person making $200K into working class category in a place like San Francisco or New York City for example) The discussion is never had, being bombarded with talking points and buzzwords like "raise taxes on the middle class" and "fair share" and "lower taxes for the poor" etc, purposeful obfuscation ignoring what any of that means.

jesus h christ, such autism. You're not as smart as you think you are. I *know* that BCH is bitcoin cash, and BTC is Bitcoin. I was specifically asking which one in light of the suddenly plummeting prices and somewhat esoteric suggestions that we sell and buy BCH which is to replace BTC instead. It's not like being on a tomato gardening subreddit precludes the possibility of conversation regarding planting petunias alongside tomatoes, ffs. Other topics will come up as they relate directly to the subreddit topic.

"DIGITAL CURRENCY" is the phrase being used silly, and I saw that phrase used in even the abstract describing the hearing.

this is so true. Do you think it has to do with "money in politics" ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:07:52
Youre not the only one, Ha
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:20:09
a lot of people are dumb and get impatient because it's a slow long term payout..also basic math. It's an investment that decreases over time. But yeah, you make a higher profit just buying. A lot of scams in cloud mining too

pshaw that's nothing- what's $600 on a $10,000 stock?
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:53:38
I'm really getting emotional this morning.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:01:28
cloud mining is an obvious solution to this.. I know someone who knows someone who built an energy efficient miner. That's what I heard though...don't know how much money it actually saves....but the miners apparently heat his house too hehe

ETH dropped too and came back right away. i wish I could say the same for BTC but fucking GDAX won't load for me for some reason
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:23:31
Well I'm a green newbie to crypto, but does this indicate there *is* no bubble? 
I keep thinking that BTC and other altcoins can't be a bubble because their value lies in the technology and its ability to work as a currency. In other words, the vision. It's not like a house value artificially low because incomes are low....people want a house but not everyone in society wants the *same one*. With Bitcoin, a number of people want an alternative currency; it's not a physical thing they are after but an idea. That has power... I don't know if that' sound economic theory or not. But I think it will grow for a while.

you really can't get a job without a phone- period. Checking the public library would take too long and likely create a missed opportunity which may frustrate a desperate fragile person further. A phone is a necessity period.

ZOMG I'm an idiot but maybe this will be educational to any other newbies? Pay attention to the "ETH" next to amount when you try to send it LOL...it's not the amount of USD , the percentage of Ether. LOL. Transaction 1 of 2: successful!

Dude. Seriously are you trolling me? This is a Bitcoin thread, or am I in the wrong place?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:49:06
no I did too. Well really a combination of thinking BTC was just going to go up, up, up for a while more and also, the hard fork was only good news on top of that, providing stability.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:56:10
oo yeah I member. Yeah member when donald trump was going to build a wall around the mesicans?

But i mean what is the difference in security? I know theyre legit but if they are the same company, will my funds be just as secure? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:29:27
I hope so since I *also* JUST bought in, as others I know have only recently as well. And I THINK so, one reason being that Ive noticed more and more people recently investing in BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:35:53
yep haha
