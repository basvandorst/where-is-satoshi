@_date: 2017-02-07 04:28:15
I saw that video. Those thugs are cowards. Don't let this stop you from protesting,. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 06:49:32
I had someone tell me about a new not yet launched shit coin they wanted to use to buy a 2.8m mansion.
lol. convert it to cash if its worth cash.
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:15:21
Somehow supply went down and so did price. Hodl ����������������
@_date: 2019-02-10 04:07:54
There's no profit when the price continues to tank day after day
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:34:12
Basically bitcoin is an ecological disaster due to the energy its wasting. 
The equivalent to rhe 63rd most energy consuming NATION. 
Its disgusting and sad.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:11:42
to produce coinage? less energy
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:13:09
lol misdirection fallacy.
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:10:38
LOL its not a security. it cant be traded by 'insiders'
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:00:59
No, Trump was given an exorbitant amount of MSM press coverage during the primaries due to the fact that he provided them with mugh higher ratings, thus gift wrapping the nomination. Then somehow the left thought Hilary was a good candidate, despite all her glaring flaws. Then he succeeded. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:23:02
Lol. Because its a pyramid scheme
@_date: 2011-06-06 12:58:31
@_date: 2018-07-19 18:31:48
its price is low. its value is 0
@_date: 2011-06-06 05:17:49
because hes a participant and a benefactor.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:10:24
lol at ppl memeing btc to success....just like they did for Bernie
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:53:03
Lol young pup
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:56:15
Yes. That means it's a commodity.
That also means it has no unique or special worth as  replication is easy and generic versions suffer no loss in quality
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:56:40
Yes but that doesn't serve to protect it's value, does it?
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:54:23
The reason it boomed last year at this time is simple: 
People were talking about it at their family dinner. 
Now people have learned more and know that they are investing in an already consumed asset - energy. So basically they are holding tokens that say "I polluted" - and now its collapsing.
@_date: 2018-12-09 02:53:33
Lol. Literally everything you wrote could be said about luluroe. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:58:33
This is true. This is just working faster here. Bitcoin has no MOAT. Nothing special keeps it from being cloned. That's it's fatal flaw(and all shitcoins too)
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:16:21
Altcoins were a large part the cause of the crash. It demonstrated that there was zero barrier to entry and that Bitcoin wasn't unique or special in any meaningful way.
Investments need a MOAT or barrier to competition to be worth a shit. This was so obvious to literally anyone who isn't retarded.
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:17:03
Lol maybe anti tyrannical but totally pro scammer
@_date: 2018-12-08 02:00:12
I'd love to short some, but I'd have to borrow some first. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:47:29
we wont be dead by the time its back under $100 or even $1
@_date: 2019-05-18 04:22:34
Then how ya gonna use them?
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:19:52
and lonely.
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:25:08
Big if true
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:15:03
@_date: 2018-12-09 02:29:38
Well, usually they go up first, like luluroe. Except at least they will have some leggings to show for it at the end of the run
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:01:15
That doesn't mean it's more valuable though.
Or are you accidentally saying Bitcoin is only worth month to the uninformed?������������
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:00:38
what does bitcoin do that altcoins cant do?
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:24:37
literally nothing. I'm saying both are shit. Not that one is better than the other. This is the problem, in investing this is defined as a lack of a moat
All coins lack the following edges or structural competitive advanages - 










Essentially they are lacking long-term competitive advantages making them a less valuable investment vehicle. If you can explain where one of them is more favorable than another on a longer term basis then I'm all ears. But essentially these are all interchangeable as best I can tell. 
This is a concept almost universally lost on all bitcoin investors. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:17:31
I think thats our best bet
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:58:22
Sears was mail order bruh. Yes they are super comparable.
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:07:41
How so? If you can't explain it then you don't understand it well enough to invest in it responsibly. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:03:14
I absolutely know what competitive edges they have if I'm investing in them.
I invest in Amazon because they are the market leader in online shopping and are poised to continue to grow in various sectors not just limited to classic retail.
I wouldn't buy a stock it I can't explain why they do it better and why it's hard to replicate.
Apple has a rabid fanbase on teenage girls which is helpful
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:07:18
They will. I mean you can say they won't but that doesn't make it true. If you can't convert it to a tubal currency it loses it's usefulness
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:27:49
Thats like saying compare Amazon's market cap to sears.... in 1997
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:25:48
Well it's a pyramid scheme that collapsed, so
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:13:43
Can you explain the moat any crypto's possess to make them investor grade?
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:51:41
Well, bitcoin and alt coins are barely distinguishable and both consist of the raw material of "spent energy"
This gain commodity status when they are interchangable and brand doesn't matter.
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:55:24
Because it is nothing more than spent energy
@_date: 2019-05-18 04:22:27
Then how ya gonna use them?
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:12:05
 It solves a non existent problem.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:11:05
If a currency seizes to expand, it will eventually seize to be traded. A currency is always simply storage mechanism for work. Eventually it will all end up in 'savings' or be hoarded. While that happens, it loses value as a currency.  
Also, all that is being traded is spent electricity. Electricity that was spent doing nothing of value to create said coin. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:24:10
So it's anti consumer and anti law enforcement? Why wouldn't we simply change or amend the laws to fix that when there's a problem? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:26:32
So sell your dollars for expended electricity?
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:26:39
Yes. If they stopped printing we'd eventually use something else. Noone uses the Mark or the Franc anymore for example.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:51:08
If the coins all got mined, then the currency becomes worthless anyway
