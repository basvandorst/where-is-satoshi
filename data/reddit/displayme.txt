Wow, I don't think I want bitcoin to go mainstream if this is the type of people it attracts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:34:28
Not an end, just more regulations.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:09:52
Well, you have a point. A lot of people have their christmas trees up right about now and that is a fire hazard.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:48:30
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:19
You aren't even a redditor, just here to name call. Shill.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:40:30
Inside job? Let's get an investigation started...
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:36:19
Oh. This is what they are talking about on the other reddits. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:47
Makes your eyes wake up...
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:53:48
No I don't. Someone with experience wouldn't handle it the way you have.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:15:44
It all depends. Why was it disabled? If not legitimate I get my cousin whos a lawyer involved and we get in there right n quick.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:45:11
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:39:19
For how long? 30 minutes? 5 hours, 2 days?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:06:02
You fraud? Or wat... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:52
Dr. Go by Reddit Postings. Who am I?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:16:04
Don't worry about people like that. Some people don't know how to interact with other human beings.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:10:56
You tell me. I really don't know what 9 AM Specific Means besides 12 PM EST.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:24:30
It's possible. I buried one of my baby beanies with my uncle.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:49:12
Capital gains...Pay up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:55:12
Yep, get your popcorn ready!
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:12:31
Well said. That and the bickering is probably a turn off to those newly introduced to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:53:23
Bit con everyday? I am out of the loop I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:42:15
Yes, in few weeks we see sky rocket my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:09:38
Huh? Where would you go to cash out somewhere that doesn't have a limit? I don't think that there is such a thing my friends.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:50:10
Start donating instead of bitching.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:01:19
Say I have five different bitcoin wallets, can I use those 5 slots for them?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:24:52
Yep. Hold tight. Relax.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:50:29
$4k is a lot of money for a teenager. Glad I could help.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:33:56
I haven't heard of him before now. He's a basketball coach?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:17:59
I got a joke for ya'
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:49:50
Well you got my guess recorded at least
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:30:01
Because a single person gained access to a persons reddit account? You're hilarious...and very immature.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:05:15
Hey bully be nice or.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:37
Don't sell low... should of stepped away from the PC. Bad move. Wait days, WEEKS, or MONTHS then sell.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:00:17
I don't care if the yankee drops to 11k. Long haul baby.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:49:27
Of course, someone worth pennies says they can do it better. Go figure!
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:56:33
99%? No.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:59:27
Nice reddit backlog you shill.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:21
If it makes you nervous, go smoke a bowl, have sex, dress up your penis. Whatever get your mind off it!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:25
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:21
How long it be unconfirmed?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:48
Post your transaction ID, I'll bump it at the top of the hour.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:05:47
Nice 1st post brah. Lols!
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:19:02
Really? If you're talking about a privacy cryptocurrency it's 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:18:33
Good advice. I told a couple of my buddies to dress up their penis, get your mind off selling.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:12:50
Do what timeonmyhandz said. Pay your capital gains rate taxes. Pay yo tax fair and square.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:53:13
When you are criticizing someone that donates millions of their own money I won't consider what you're saying.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:45:05
It's the real deal. Been happening for awhile. I don't like it. Especially when they ain't upfront about it. I am thinking about hitting them over the head with a baseball bat.
