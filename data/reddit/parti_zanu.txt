@_date: 2018-01-22 00:15:23
I think you are a little confused by the term "difficulty".
The end goal is not to have low difficulty.
The difficulty is the mecanism that keeps the blocks evenly spaced in time, no matter if it's 10s or 30m, regardless of the computing power of the network.
The difficulty acts as a break so a sudden increase in computing power will not result in 1.000 blocks produced in 1 minute.
The difficulty auto-adjusts down if the global computing power decreses, so the remaining of the computing power would still be able to produce the blocks at the same pace.
Is not important if the pace is 1 block/sec or 1 block/hour, you still need the difficulty to keep that pace as fixed as possible.

Bitcoin transactions are broadcasted to all nodes, they don't use a particular node.
for example, on my node, if I run
    bitcoin-cli getmempoolinfo      
I get
    "size": 61134,
    "bytes": 107633434,
    "usage": 247281568,
    "maxmempool": 300000000,
    "mempoolminfee": 0.00002513
meaning that my node has received 61134 broadcasted transactions.

I know the difference, hence the correction. Median is relevant to the discussion because it gives you the fee for 50% of the included transactions in the block.
Average is prone to be more influenced by large outliers as transactions from exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:58:40


Fees will never be zero because that opens the pool to spam attacks. 
Fees will adjust over zero by demand of the market.
In this "fee market" there are the coin users (who make transactions and need those transactions to be mined in blocks) and the miners (who make the blocks and need a fee to continue making blocks)

No, you can't mine that transaction myself.
In order to do that, you would need a hashpower comparable with the big mining pools so you would have a chance to produce a block before they do.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:47:38


Or we could rephrase it like this: 
No matter the state of mempool, mining power or fee amount, expect some transactions to take up to 1 hour every 3 or 4 days.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:09:02
It's about the public key being un/compressed before hashing. The hash result is not compressed.
* Public Address - hash of a 65 bytes uncompressed public key.
In their traditional uncompressed form, public keys contain an identification byte, a 32-byte X coordinate, and a 32-byte Y coordinate.
* Public Address Compressed - hash of a 33 bytes compressed public key
An almost 50% reduction in public key size can be realized without changing any fundamentals by dropping the Y coordinate. This is possible because only two points along the curve share any particular X coordinate, so the 32-byte Y coordinate can be replaced with a single bit indicating whether the point is on what appears in the illustration as the “top” side or the “bottom” side.

Technically speaking, nothing compels miners to include any transactions in a block.
They can mine blocks with 0 transactions, 1 transaction, 2000 transactions, only transactions from Mondays, only transactions that starts with FFFFFF or only transactions with fees above 1000 sat/B.
The fees they get from including transactions in blocks is about 16% of total revenue - so if they are willing to forgo collecting that, they can do it, for 1 block, 10 blocks or whatever.
Same goes for a minimum fee.
It's a self balancing system. If for example BTC.com decides to mine only zero-transactions blocks, they will do that. The price of BTC will start to decline (probably?) until a tipping point when BTC.com will start to ask "wtf are we doing, we are just hurting ourselfs" - and they will start to include transactions of X fee.
And the system will continue to adjust itself further.
Some people might like it, some might not.

Any discussion about the centrality of LN is kind of pointless without factoring the amount of BTC available on each channel.
If a node has 10.000 opened channels it will appear as a hub on the visualization.
But if each channel has just 0.000001 BTC, that node will be unable to route the vast majority of the transactions - making it irrelevant in a "hubs and spokes" discussion.
For a better quantification of the centrality we could ask


If that will show that the majority of the paths will go through *(let's say)* 3 specific nodes - those are your hubs (and that's a metric of the network centrality we can monitor to see if LN is getting more centralized or decentralized over time).
Of course, the discussion is theoretical, because IRL not every node needs to exchange BTC with every other node. But we can still use the metric because we need a measurement for the network as a whole.
Or maybe I'm wrong and there is a better way.
Anyway, LN is cool.

Indeed it vary but only up; I would expect to also go down but maybe the net adds are always compensating.

Any transaction with 3 minutes confirmation time would be **very lucky** because that would require a block to be mined in (a little less) than 3 minutes instead of the usual 10 minutes/block.
Contrariwise, anybody who made a transaction on Jan 09 at about 22:19 would had to wait about **35 minutes** for a confirmation.
That's because block [503405]( was mined with a timestamp of 22:19:16 and the next block [503406]( was mined with a timestamp of 22:55:49. So no transactions were confirmed for 35 minutes.
At the moment, average time between blocks is [7 minutes]( so that is what I would consider the lowest normal BTC confirmation time.

Not sure why is this a reply on my comment ... I was just stating that, as fees are paid in a BTC fractions, they need to go down faster than BTC:USD goes up.
    If your fee is 10 satoshi @ BTC:USD 10000
    and it drops to 5 satoshi @ BTC:USD 20000 
    you are paying the same value of USDs
    hence fees must go down
    faster than BTC:USD goes up
I was not talking about adoption and/or other coins.

That is the minimum fee the node accepts a transaction in its mempool. If your transaction is lower than that, I will not be able to find it in my node mempool, but other nodes with lower min fee could have it.
From a mining pool perspective, the only mempool that matters is its own mempool. Mining pools are choosing what transactions to include in their blocks from their own mempools, so it's irrelevant if  your transaction is in my mempool or not.

Technically speaking, nothing compels miners to include any transactions in a block. They can mine blocks with 0 transactions, 1 transaction, 2000 transactions, only transactions from Mondays or only transactions that starts with FFFFFF.
The fees they get from including transactions is about 16% of total revenue - so if they are willing to forgo collecting that, they can do it, for 1 block, 10 blocks or whatever.

That's not how it works.
Pools do not need transactions to be submitted in any way.
Pools choose transactions from mempool. The same mempool everybody is bitching when it's overloaded.
The "service" is simply preying on desperate people that want their transaction to be mined.
If by chance the transaction gets mined, they keep your money. If it doesn't get mined, (maybe) they will refund you.
100% shady unless they are willing to explain the process. In the world of openness and transparency of Bitcoin, **do not trust anything that is not fully explained**.

A $10 would *probably* used less TXOs than $1000, so *probably* not the same fee.


It *kind of scale*.
Most people don't bother to consolidate outputs on a regular basis, so the larger the amount being transferred, the larger the number of TXOs being used - and the larger the transaction gets in size.
So *in a way* fees scale with the amount but not directly (and not always).

spacemining... I guess they went for the moon ahead of others
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:32:11
*(napkin math follows)*
Each input adds about 150-180 bytes to the transaction. Let's average that to 165 bytes.
If you are paying (for example) 100 satoshis/bytes, that means each input costs you 16500 satoshis (0.000165 BTC).
* A transaction with 1 input = 0.000165 BTC (~$2 tx fee - at *current* BTC:USD rates)
* A transaction with 100 inputs = 0.0165 BTC (~$200 tx fee - at *current* BTC:USD rates)
If you see the mempool is empty and transactions with 5 sat fee are getting mined, consolidation is a great thing IMHO.


As per your edit: if fees *per byte* were to stay constant, adding more bytes (*more inputs*) would mean adding more to the final tx fee.

That's because the overall number of transactions in blocks were low.
Consider this:

* block 505253: 21% segwit (segwit 54, non-segwit 198)

Absolutely. But as far as I know, LN uses something akin to BGP, hence it will go for shortest path. I might be wrong.
Also, if you want to dive deeply into the concept of "shortest", it might be a combination of factors like (reachable + sufficient liquidity + lowest fee + fewest hops + most reliable).
Nevertheless, just the number of channels a node has is no indication if the network is centralized or not. Its routing importance *(how often it is chosen by the routing algorithm)* can be used to measure the centralization-tendency of the network - and that can hold true no matter how many hops you have.

@_date: 2018-01-20 13:00:11


ELIx: when/if the next block will be mined by ViaBTC, they promise to include your transaction in it, even if your transaction wouldn't be normaly included due to its low fee.
At the moment, ViaBTC accounts for [~12%]( of mined blocks, so I would say there is as 12% chance they honor that promise. That chance gets lower depending how many transactions they promise to include, due to the fact that there is a limit to how many transactions a block can hold and also they would want to also include some transactions with high(er) fees for some legitimate economic gain.
If the blocks are mined by other pools, there is no way for a 3rd party to guarantee or influence what transactions will be included in that block - the extreme case being that miners can mine blocks with zero transactions included, if they choose to.
Hope this helps.

*(simplifying a lot of stuff)*
If you know how a simple hashing function works (let's say MD5), the puzzle is like this: given some string S1, what other string S2 do you need to add to it in order that MD5(S1+S2) would start exactly with '098f6bcd462'?
That question can't be answered without bruteforcing all the S2s until you find the one.
So if you found the one, I know for sure you did the actual work, because there is no other way to find it.
Hence, proof of work.

Who says so? What are the losses to have x% of the nodes constantly lagging behind?
Why not take it the other way around: run a simulation with a network the size of bitcoin network, propagate some 2-4 Mb blocks across the network, take into account how bandwidth is distributed in the world, see what is the minimum time to keep the 95% of the network in sync.
If you can mathematically prove that can be done in 5 minutes constantly, then you could say it's cost-inefficient by a factor of 2.
I myself don't know if 10 minutes is the magic number - I would be very interested in such a simulation.

You will not, somebody will.
You will be the happy guy posting "hey, my transaction got confirmed in 5 minutes".
He will be the sad guy saying "and here I am, waiting for an hour for a confirmation".
EDIT: Also, while no blocks are generated, everybody who wants a transaction in that specific time frame waits. There is no way around this.

How about you write a guide for small-business owners about the logistics of accepting payments in BTC?
No, not another "run a full node / LN" guide, but one that deals with the complexity of acquiring, selling, cashing in, accouting, settling and so on.
Better yet, how about we stop telling other people what to do?
I don't see Core devs or major BTC vectors/promoters coming here each and every day and saying "guys, you need to hodl", "guys, you need to boycott", "guys, you need to run stuff", "guys, you need to do more".

- you will see incoming connections only when your blockchain is synchronized
- test your 8333/tcp port (
- google "&lt;your router name&gt; port forwarding tutorial"


You will only get 8 connections outbound. It's hard-coded in the core client (via MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS constant).
When your 8333 port will be open and properly forwarded, you will get up to 125 inbound connections. You can change that via -maxconnections switch.

Be that as it may, the system doesn't encourage decentralization.
Maybe there is a probability that everything will work out, but I rather not take a chance with a small pool.
Beyond any statistical and philosophical reasoning, you really want to be as sure as you can you'll be able to pay the bills.
So, there is motivation to join a big pool but close to none to join a small pool.
In my opinion, if we want to decentralize mining (**which we should**), we should ask what things need to change to motivate miners to do move to a smaller pool.
I would also encourage everybody who has a strong opinion in this matter to buy a few S9's and join a small pool.

Each pool has its own rules for picking what to include in a block - most of the times is highest-fee-first (because it makes sense, economically) - but is not a rule (as evidence see the number of empty blocks mined).
There is no way to force a pool to mine a transaction - and that's a good thing.

That's not true. 
The average number of transactions included in one block is ~2000.
If there are 3000 transactions already waiting in the mempool at 50 sat/b - and you add another one - your TX might not be mined within the next block.
Now that your TX wasn't mined in the next block, it will stay in the mempool for the next 10 minutes. During those 10 mins, others will look at the fees in the mempool and broadcast their transactions, maybe with a higher fee, as they try to secure a place in the next block.
And so, your transaction at the original 50 sat/b might be overlooked once again by the miners. And now you are waiting for another block.
It's already 20 mins after your placed your TX and it's still not mined. You keep refreshing the blockchain explorer, but you still have zero confirmations.

| Oct 15   	| $5,836    	| 234%         	| 57%            	|
| Nov 15   	| $6,635    	| 194%         	| 38%            	|
| Dec 15   	| $16,601   	| 17%          	| -45%           	|
| Jan 15   	| $13,767   	| 41% *        	| -33%           	| 
That raise from September to December was possible exactly because people bought BTC **after September**. And at high volume.

I`m sorry, but I lack the windows experience of bitcoin.
What *I* would do:
* backup the wallet (the file, export the wallet, copy the entire directory, whatever you can handle)
* delete the debug.log (it will get re-created)
* start bitcoin core
* stop bitcoin
* open the fresh debug.log and read it - look for anything like: can't open files, can't find files, can't find a directory, blocks are corrupted etc.
* google that specific problem
If all else fails, I would even go and post the debug.log (as I'm pretty sure Core would not log anything confidential in a plain text file, as private keys or such) and wait for a windows user to reply.
Best of luck.

as said, [cb59399c68...]( uses an output from [e37448e442...]( which is also unconfirmed.
And that transaction also uses at least 1 unconfirmed output.
So in order to confirm your transaction, all the chained past transactions used as inputs need to be confirmed.
That's why people wait for *at least* 1 confirmation before considering that BTC as *received*.

Might be, but it answers the comment of "gets dismissed often times"
If you bough at 15k, you don't care about the "+500% increase", for you it never happend. For others did. But not for you. So you have no reason to mention it, as it may never happen again.
It's also a question of magnitude.
If you are in with 1 BTC = 3k and you lose -50% that's $1,5k. Tought luck. If you are in with 1 BTC = 15k, you just lost 7k. That virtual "+500% increase" means little to nothing for you.
So yeah, maybe they just haven't been in the market long enough but the lose is real and people shouldn't be so baffled that not everybody is jumping of joy because of *gainz*. That's not how people work IRL.

Bitcoin rhetoric in (social) media is powered by two opposing forces:
*The FUDlers* – the guys who wants you to sell; they will post anything that puts Bitcoin in a bad light, no matter how wrong, small or irrelevant is
*The Fluffers* – the guys who wants you to buy; they will post anything that puts Bitcoin in a good light, no matter how wrong, small or irrelevant is
There is also a third force, but it doesn’t manifest visibly in the media: *The HODLers*.
Why it doesn’t manifest itself? Because the HODLers do not care if you buy or sell, because they are in it for the long run and dips or pumps have no traction of their holding philosophy. They believe not in the Bitcoin as is today but in the Bitcoin as it will be in 10 years. That’s why most of the vocal HODLers are, in fact, undercover Fluffers.
Taking these into account, you discover that *nobody wants Bitcoin to be stable*.
There is no speculative money to be made from a stable Bitcoin. The fuel that makes the wheels turn is volatility.
But high volatility has its price.

yeah but count or value?
let's say over the year you have 1.000 transactions moving $100.000:
- 2 transactions of $45.000 each
- 998 transactions of $10 each
If you go by *count* and do all the $10's via bitcoin, you can say "in 2019 I did 99,98% of my transactions via BTC"
If you go by *value*, the percent drops to 10%.

also, we are still not addresing the initial problem
if you break slushpool (10%) in 10 smaller 1% pools of course on paper that is descentralization
but if the top pool (20%) mines with its own hardware, you just descentralized an entity but not fixed the system
that's why, in order to solve the problem, you need to change the mining system somehow - but i have no idea what could be done to make a difference

You should factor in your "mental exercise" the fact that, even if you say *"there are only 21 million bitcoins"*, each bitcoin is divisible up to its one hundred millionth part.
So there are/will be 2,100,000,000,000,000 tradable units (that's *two quadrillion one hundred trillion* satoshi). As we speak, 1 satosh = $0.00003.

Is not the address, is the correlations that can be made.
*For example*: you post your address on reddit. Judge subpoena reddit to give your login information. They give your IP address. Police goes to your ISP and say "I want to know to whom you assigned this address on Dec 6". They look in the logfiles and find your MAC address/your modem etc. They cross-reference that with their payment system and find their internal customer ID, linked to your billing information (name, address etc).
"but... but ... I use Tor and proxy and a public wifi and a second hand laptop bough anonymously with cash from a drunk guy at the bus stop"
that's why I said "for example" - is not always like this step-by-step, but they will try to correlate all the information they have at their disposition. 
same goes for private citizens - they correlate info - and there are some guys that can do awesome doxxing work out there.

I think the biggest barrier is access to industrial-level electricity price.
Of course, you could argue that low price derives from high consumption, which in turn derives from hoarding a lot of hardware, which, in the end, means access to large funds.

I'm sorry, but I disagree.
In my opinion, once there is an active threat (an ongoing attack), this should become public knowledge ASAP.

* here's what the users can do to minimize the risks
* here's what the users must not do
* here's what the company is doing to remedy the problem
You may be comfortable with your rationalization of this kind of crisis management, but I'm not.

I'm not downvoting, but how about posting a monthly business plan for a business runing on BTC?
There are more than enough tehnical resources, but there are few (none?) that deal with the business operations.
How do you pay your salaries?
How do you pay your taxes? What country is your business located? How is the financial legislation in relation with BTC?
How do you aquire your products / raw materials? Do you deal with suppliers in BTC or fiat? What exchange do you use? When do you do the exchange? Any tips on how to run a business and staying liquid despite price fluctuations?
How does your bookkeeping looks like?
How does your invoices look like?
... and so on.
Again, **please** take no offence in this post, I'm not bashing the tehnical part - but providing an example on how a real business integrates BTC in its day-to-day operation would be more useful by order of magnitude.

There's always a solution, best one is not artificially create a problem in the first place.
Blockchain integrity is no joke for bitcoin community, that's why we don't download the blockchain via torrents but we validate the blockchain every time. For every block. For every transaction.
Selling a device with a "prevalidated" copy of the blockchain should be a no-no and should raise the hairs on the back of your neck.
I really don't understand what's the point of this discussion - running an unvalidated/prevalidated copy of the blockchain goes against a lot of bitcoin core values.

Your understanding is correct.

Value is ultimately determined by what people are willing to trade for.
This means anything could fall to zero. Including BTC.
In the same way BTC rised over a few years, something else could be already rising, unbeknownst to us, and making BTC obsolete. Nothing is absolute, nothing is perfect, nothing is final. There is always change.
There is a lot of talk about supply (and strangely so, because it's one of the few things that are already very clear) - and very little talk about demand (beside anecdotal ones).

Because "percentage" are not a measure of units of *something* but a ratio between two quantities of *something*.
(let's see if I can ELI5 without fucking it up)
 
- You have 1 apple.
- You want to add 1 apple.
- Your initial quantity has increased by 100% (1 over 1, 1/1, 1, 100%)
- Now you have 2 apples.
- You want to subtract 1 apple.
- You are left with 1 apple.
- Your initial quantity has decreased by 50% (1 out of 2, 1/2, 0.5, 50%)
The math checks out, but you do have to be aware of people using percentages to "trick" your mind.

I get what you're saying, but if all miners would stop (and just some 1 lonely dude would continue to mine), the blocks would eventually be mined and the difficulty would adjust. It would take a lot of time, but it would happen. 
We are, of course, talking about a SF scenario (there is only 1 guy mining), but even in that scenario, a block is bound to be generated. The difficulty will drop. Things would move on. There is literally 0% chance that absolutely nobody will mine.
I would mine just in spite of whoever stopped all the miners.

We all know bitcoin is [pseudo-anonymous]( and everybody can "track" bitcoins due to the *public* nature of the ledger.
The answer should be more nuanced when we are talking about linking an individual to a bitcoin address. Here, the answer is *"it depends"*. There are scenarios where this link is extremly hard to achieve (just so I don't use the word *impossible*).
But I would say "IRS can track Bitcoin" is a blanket statement and, in this context, used to instill fear in order to promote a comercial product.

If you want to split hairs, miners mine blocks - not coins.
Usually by "mineable coins" people mean "new coins that are created as a reward for mining a new block". By this definition, BTC will become non-mineable in 2140.
Non-mineable (or pre-mined) means that all the available coins already exist and there is no way of creating more through mining blocks. Exactly what will happen with BTC in 2140.
If you use "non-mineable" in another sense or while having another definition, of course all this might be wrong.
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:49:57
I like how we went from "nobody will mine" to "1 user will mine" to "some users will mine" :)

in the most basic terms:
- you pick a number of transactions from the mempool, using whatever criteria you want (lets say by transaction fee)
- you build a merkle tree of those transactions
- you look at the difficulty and build the criteria dictated by it (let's say the criteria is "generate a SHA256() that starts with 10 consecutive zeros")
- you take the root of the merkle tree and start hashing it, changing the nonce, until you stumble upon the first hash that starts with 10 consecutive zeros
- you broadcast the transactions you picked, the nonce and the hash you found, proving that you did the work
- ta-da! you mined a block
- repeat ad nauseam

Scarcity doesn't imply value. It's demand that gives value to something.
You know what else is scarce? Radioactive waste. Old audio cassettes. C64 computers. Microsoft Windows 3.11 licences. PATA drivers. 8-inch floppy disks.
If you hope your hidden stash of millions of Microsoft Zune players will each worth billions one day - I say don't hold your breath.

First of all, there is such a thing as cost of democracy.
Running a parliament costs. Having periodic elections costs. Having fair and secured elections costs. Giving people a free day to vote costs. Having a system to protect your freedoms costs. Having a system to ensure your sovereignty costs. Driving to cast a vote costs. Teaching people to read and write so they can use a modern voting system costs. And so on. You know what's cheap? Having only one person in charge is cheap. Not having elections is cheap. Show me a group of people that is free and I'll show you a group of people that is willing and able to pay to ensure their freedom.
Second, OP's argument (and my comment) was about impoverished people (from impoverished countries).
If you are impoverished, your first priority shouldn't be spending money on safeguarding bitcoin network.
Your first priority should be using bitcoin to provide for your family (food, shelter, medical assistance, decent living conditions). That's your main priority.  If you can do that by using bitcoin, you don't need to run a full node.
After that, if you can raise yourself from poverty, and you want to contribute to the network, fine, more power to you. Yes, the entry threshold should be low, but there will always be a cost.
Also, the network shouldn't base its strength on nodes run by impoverished people. We, the rest, the people who "enjoy our extravagant standard of living" and who are willing and able to pay $50, $60, $100 to run a full node, should do it so other poorer people would have the safety of using bitcoin in a safe network. And maybe one day join us. The strength of the bitcoin network shouldn't be ensured by the financial efforts of the poor people from Congo, Mozambique and Uganda. Instead, we should shoulder the (small) costs so they don't have to - and provide them with the opportunity to rise up from their harsh conditions.

Some of your wording might be too harsh (*bitcoin is a deeply flawed technology, overall bad design choice* etc).
Some are overblown (lost bitcoins, people dislike the use of decimals, lack of ISO code).
Some I take a real interest in. Like the ones about the actual accounting workings of BTC inside a company.
I have yet to see a nice detailed post from somebody who implemented bitcoin in his business about the accounting part. Invoices, ERP, supply chains, taxes, wages, banks, state audits - the usual day-to-day workings of any business.
Not on how it *could* work, not on how it *might* work - but on how it had work and it is working as we speak.
I think it would be an invaluable post for the community, a jump-start for other businesses to adopt bitcoin - and an overall nice read.

@_date: 2018-12-02 00:36:49


if by "account" you mean a BTC address that you don't have the private key, all you need to do is download the blockchain, parse all the transactions in each block, add the amounts sent *to* that address, substract the amounts sent *from* that address and at the end you will have the current balance of the address.
As you parse the transactions, you can calculate whatever you want in regards to that address (who sent, when, how much, at what fee, what was the fiat value of the transaction at that time or, you know, whatever).
There are loads of scripts and tutorials on parsing transactions, so you'll have lots of materials to work with.

The price of bitcoin on a *specific* exchange is determined by the point where the lowest seller meets the highest buyer
As the *exchanges are not interconnected* and not everybody is doing arbitrage, the average price of all the exchanges is an overview of the market.
If you have fiat on exchange A and see a better price on exchange B, unless you have the logistics in place to play arbitrage, you can't buy on B. As far as your buying capabilities are, price on B is irrelevant, if you can't buy at that price.
That average price, usually instantaneous (not per day, transaction or w/e) could be use as an price for OTC trading / face-to-face trading

I'm sure even the **dumbest automaton-like** strategy will do better:
- start with $100, buy
- sell if at +150%
- repeat
- start with $100, buy
- sell if at +150%
- rebuy with $X + 50% of earnings
- repeat
or 
- start with $100, buy
- sell if at +150%
- rebuy 75% of earnings
- repeat

If you want to factor just the power cost, the equation is simple.
At the moment, the most used miner (S9) is profitable at $0.06/KWh making you $0.2/day. You can look up where in the world you can get that price for power.
Out of those 20 cents/day/miner, you need to save up for space rent, equipment cooling, spare parts (ASIC boards, sources, fans etc), maintenance shutdown (usually to clean miners), mine security, hardware RoI (if not paid yet), internet connection (and some form of backup) etc.
After that, you (and maybe your associates) can keep/split what's left.
And maybe pay some taxes.
Those extra 5.400.000 USD/day on the table were so useful a month ago.

Get yourself the cheapest Pi you can find, no matter the performance. If you can find an used one, it's perfect. Proceed to follow an online guide, literally using copy/paste. Do this a few times. Worst case scenario, you now have some $20-something piece of hardware in a drawer.


Use testnet. Get some free BTC from a faucet. Send as many transactions as you like to yourself, to some random testnet addresses. Make multiple addresses for yourself, send BTC from one to another. Intentionally break things up, trash your wallet, fuckup your tx, unleash the nightmares you are afraid of.

50% drop in mining would mean that the mempool would get full (it usually has a limit of 300Mb, but can be adjusted) in about 24 hours.
And it will stay full for the next theoretical 2 weeks. 
Last time when the mempool was congested from time to time (not full but at around half of the capacity), the fees went up to ridiculous values (x10 at least, x100 was seen). It was bad.
Now imagine having that for 2 weeks, not from time to time.
Does that mean bitcoin *will* die? Doubtfully.
Does that mean bitcoin *could* die? There is always a chance. The psychological damage would be great, people would fear bitcoin even more, adoption would take a back-step, people would remember it for a *long fucking time*.
Does that mean we should shrug at this hashrate drop? I think not, hashrate is a symptom, a signal, an indicator. It says something, because those miners wouldn't turn off the hardware "just coz".
Does that mean we should panic at this hashrate drop? At the moment, I see no reasons to panic. The hashrate is still immense.

Miners choose what transactions will be included in the block they mine. They can select by whatever criteria they want.
The most common one is the transaction fee. But that is not a guarantee, as evidenced by the empty blocks (blocks with zero transactions) they sometimes decide to mine.
The only sensible thing to do, if you are **really in a hurry to be confirmed**, is to have your transaction with a fee that will put it in the top 1500 transactions (the average number of transactions in a block) in the mempool at the time, so it's logical for the miners to include it in the next block (and collect the fee).
But again, it's not a sure thing. As I said, miners decide what transactions to mine, base on their own incentives, criteria, strategy - or whatever.
The most you can do is to provide an incentive. 
As fees are a delicate subject and always spawn flame wars, I'll just link you these two sites:

You misunderstood what "confirmations" mean in bitcoin... slang (?).
Confirmations doesn't mean other nodes confirm that your transaction was mined.
It means how many blocks were mined *after* the block with your transaction - so it's *confirmed* that the probability of somebody mining a longer chain that doesn't include your block is close to zero - making that transaction truly immutable.

I would also go the other way: don't make it too broad.
A personal experience, tailored to your specific niche would be as valuable (or even more, because you *know* your niche).
I'm not talking about you *personally*, but I would love to hear some details about the every-day-business-life of somebody who integrated BTC in its business.

set `prune=N` on the command line or in bitcoin.conf, where N is the number of MiB to allot for raw block and undo data.


you will still download the full blockchain but you will not keep it as you download more and more blocks over the prune limit

I mean if they don't know, understand, and agree *why* they should use bitcoin, the rest of the questions are just trivia information.
But once again, good idea with the questionnaire.
I say put it on github so people can contribute/correct stuff and, in time, have a better and better version of this, for whoever wants to use it.

Nothing from 1 to 5 will make the mempool fill slower or empty faster in case of such a massive hashdrop.
LN also needs on-chain transactions when opening the channel and when you want to settle. Or everytime you want that sweet fiat in your hands to pay the rent.
Keep in mind I didn't factored panic in (and what it can do to the price) once the stories about people not being able to get their money in 1-2-3-4-10-24-48 hours.
Do you really want to see what such panic can do? can you imagine what CNN titling "Bitcoin crash (again): for more than a week, people are unable to get their money back" can do to a $4000 bitcoin?
As i said, I do not think there is a reason to panic now - but I'm not comfortable sweeping everything under the rug.
I never liked the "It's fine" meme.

@_date: 2018-12-07 13:24:17
Short answer: bitcoin development is not correlated to bitcoin price. 
There are other ways and reasons for the developers to be paid - without any connection with market price.
At one time there was a "Sponsorship Programme" for Bitcoin Core. There was also the "Bitcoin Foundation".
There is MIT [Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative]( who pays some core developers.
Some developers run their own firms so they can pay themselves or lend development man-hours to Core: Blockstream, Chaincode Labs, Ciphrex, BTCC.
Developers working for yet other companies provide somewhat informal support through documentation or other help. 
There are also some [NGOs]( but I don't know if they provide funding.
And more.

In order to attack 20 Eh/s, you need to generate 11 Eh/s (rounding up).
11 Eh/s = 11,000,000 Th / 20,5 = 536.585 [Antminer S11]( at **$545 each** = **$292.439.024** = $300 millions (rounding up)
$300 millions &lt; $6 billions
Also, let's not forget that there are already hostile forces toward BTC that already wield 5 to 8 Eh/s. So they don't need to buy all the hardware, don't care if they loose money as long as it hurts BTC - and they don't "throw the investment into the shit hole" because they already are in the mining business.
But nobody is really concerned about all that because of the *"This is good for bitcoin"* general mood.

How about you just read what I say and stop "implying"?
I said that you can buy 2 Tb cheap so you can run whatever you want to run. I made no judgement on what the hardware is used for - just the fact that is affordable to acquire. Eventually, even the mainnet will grow, maybe you also want to run a testnet node too .. whatever, who cares? If you get a Pi you can very well get a 2 Tb HDD too.
The fact that "you don't need to RUN a full node in order to use bitcoin" was in relation with the "folks in impoverished countries" comment.
Those who are poor must know that **using bitcoin** doesn't come with the requirements for full node hardware or full node synchronization. It is in their interest to know this fact. Get the cheapest phone and the cheapest data plan - and you can send and receive bitcoin. Again, my comment didn't said anything about the size of the block.
Would you please stop implying?

yep, I managed to replicate it too
my guess: google is trying to calculate the *"x minutes ago"* based not on when it crawled that page but based on time() - published time as reported by the page (via meta tags like *article:published_time* or *og:updated_time*).
somehow that rolls back to zero - and epoch timestamp of zero usually converts to 1.1.1970
just a guess
