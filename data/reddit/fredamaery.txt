Thanks Luke, great job with Knots.

Satoshi was not god and I think he/she/they would be the first to admit that not everything was right first time around.

Well if you read the article you will probably notice the part that says
"No one has yet managed to create the state of matter needed for such excitations, let alone a topological qubit."

lol - Do you mean like the Ethereum fork(s)?  How many is it they've had now, 3 or have done the 4th already?

Why are some people putting trust into a technology when they don't even know who the developers are.  Is this a joke?

Good try but nobody here's going to believe that.  Have you failed to notice the other thread with 250 upvotes? By the way your posting history is laughable. A lot of false information being posted by you and I love the post where you say: 
"Ver is not blocking SegWit. That is propaganda"

I'll add Washing to my BBB (Big Block Bozos) list :-)  Agreed about Brian but Washington is certainly not helping his OB product with some of his recent ramblings and he would probably serve OB better by not being such a jerk when it comes to SegWit and pissing off the developers.

haha you're funny.  Why not just answer the question.

Looks good but seems like I can only see change in price for the last one week and can't extend beyond that to show months.

So funny where you try to blame the screen shot.  Do you think Roger's twitter account was hacked too :-)

Satoshi was a contributor. Have the BU developers been contributing also?
