Oh shi---
We will look into that, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:04:47
Nice! Wish you the best of luck in your sells.
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:40:22
Not too much longer, fingers crossed.
Have a guy working on it right now. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:10:53
Oh man, that's an awesome idea. You can list and house and put no shipping. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:03:10
Wish I could give $1000 to everybody. ;)

Can you download Tor in China?
That will let you access all blocked websites and content.
Also, if you don't mind, send me a PM on what it's like to live in China. I'm seriously considering moving to Hong Kong. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:06:28
You ain't kidding.
There's still time to make it sleeker and sexier, though, and we're open to suggestion.
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:02:17
Well that's no good.
I've passed this suggestion along and it should be fixed soon. (I also use the + sign to sort emails, so I understand your pain).
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:49:08
I've noticed the dropdown menu issue as well, and have forwarded your feedback to the monkeys in charge of this sort of thing. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:11:22
Buy and sell stuff with Bitcoin. Super simple. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:46:20
Thanks for the heads up.
I've contacted our people about this and it should be fixed shortly. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:39:37
We strongly suggest that you use a unique password, not just when signing up to our website, but all websites that involve financial or personal information.  
*Edit: Also, if you want to use an alias when signing up, we're cool with that.*
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:44:53
As long as it isn't a fedora, we're cool. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:28:24
The one and only. Thanks, man. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:10:01
The monkeys in the basement are working on it as we speak. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:15:03
Working on the dropdown thing. I know that can be a pain, hang cool and we'll get it fixed.
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:09:21
Thanks man, those were some good times. 
Well, maybe not for him. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:17:03
Go for it!
It never hurts to try.
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:45:28
No problem, homeslice.
Get on there and sell and spend.
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:36:14
And this isn't just for Bitcoin-related stuff. You should never use the same password on any website. You can never be too safe. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:04:09
Shh, don't tell the Grammar Nazi's.
We'll get it fixed shortly. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:53:18
It's all good. An alias works just fine. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:16:19
Aw shucks, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:51:28
You purchase credits with BTC to use in the store. We're offering free credits to beta testers to buy whatever they want. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:55:26
Buy or sell as much as you want. That's it. 
We've also gotten a lot of great feedback from these comments alone— that's more than we could ask for, and was well worth the $1500+ in credits we've given away so far.
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:12:07
We've sprung a few leaks, but this ship ain't going down. 
Thanks for signing up.
