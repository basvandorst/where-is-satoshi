He's given numbers for the breakeven point of miners and the shutdown point of the miners. 
But he keeps including this 'selling the miners' dollar value in it. He claims he, and major miner companies, buy miners and then resell them for a profit every 3 months. He's then using that number to add to the profit of mining and determine when mining becomes unprofitable.
That makes zero sense. 
For one, it's not repeatable. The fact you could buy miners brand new, then re-sell them for a profit 3 months later is unreliable. He even acknowledges that wouldn't work again... if BTC price is down, in this case from 11.5k to 7.5k the price the miner price drops and you can't sell for profit... so why the hell is this in the equation?
On top of that he's said he counts this as 'revenue' in his accounting.
If you bought a bulldozer for construction, then sold the bulldozer, even for a a profit...you can't call that 'revenue'. You're simply speculating on miners themselves at that point and it has nothing to do with mining, you're flipping capital equipment.
That's the  objection here, he's including 'revenue' from that when it's completely not allowed to be included and by his own admission isn't repeatable anyway.
He also talks about a point miners simply stop mining. The only reason you'd stop mining is if the electricity costs was bigger than the revenue. But he says big miners would stop at $2k and small ones would stop at $7k.
Again, that's completely insane, in order for that to be true we'd have to say the small/medium sized miners are paying 5-6x the electricity costs the big ones are. 
That's a strange assumption that makes no sense. 
I've got a pretty small recreational mining operation and I'm at 0.052 in cost, not even double the big miners. How is he getting to the 0.19 needed to make 7k unprofitable?
He's also not at all considering the difficulty rates or mining pool. If people in the mining pool did in fact start to shut down...it makes those still mining mine more. 
The reality is while he's attempted to 'correct' it as people pointed it out, he claimed shutdown point was about $7k.
The very basic math says it's $2k, even excluding this miner re-sale and assuming normal electricity rates. The idea its "2k for big guys and $7k for small" is idiotic. It's more like $1.5k for Big, $2k-2.5k for Small even if you don't assume a smaller mining pool. 
Then as people have pointed out, he's making up his own 'operation' the idea he's running 1,000 miners off solar power in the desert for free has been debunked in previous posts, he's just lying about all this. He's also claimed his dad works at Valve and he's won a Yacht in a bet and a bunch of dumb shit he's been called out on in the past

So they've taken your money personally, and like OP said, a quick google search shows they've stolen money from many many other people and have staff members from Cryptsy and the owner is  Robert Genito  
How fucking stupid are people? Your money is gone...you gave CASH to a scam site from a guy who has made multiple scams so far employing a staff who has run other different scams. Jesus Christ

From all the comments and responses here, I think it's safe to assume that Dan here is simply lying to everyone and doesn't actually own any of this or know how math works?
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:33:08
He's answered people's questions...incorrectly. 
Its clear what he means, its simply wrong. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:03:50
Can you explain it to me? because that seems right. If there's deflation, it obviously favors the person who currently had more money.   
How would that not be the case? No matter what instead of them losing 2% a year, they gain something instead.   
Even if someone was vastly out-earning them, they'd close the gap at a slower rate then they would with inflation. How is that wrong just as a matter of basic math?

That's not what DCA is in the firstp lace, if you're just buying lower when you think it'll rise...that's just buying it.   
DCA is when you intentionally buy in set intervals for the same amount of money over time.
@_date: 2019-11-24 07:04:58
Academic papers don't "expire" they're either disproven or not.   
But There's like dozens of papers on DCA and none of them endorse it, recent or old.
@_date: 2019-11-30 10:34:02
No, it does have to be pre-set intervals to be considered DCA. The idea is its same dollar value, same time increments.

The PROBLEM is that you explained yours mate. It's fucking wrong bud. 
And you keep citing your own company as the source. You can't cite yourself as the source of something you're claiming.

The original numbers are right. 
That is the total output tx volume. 
Those are the market prices.
Then you took the step of just taking them and multiplying them together.
like this entire post of like 30 comments is telling you why that's wrong and you're not listening bud. 
If I said the population of the UK is 66.04 million and the average income is 60,000 pounds
Therefore the GDP is 3.9 Trillion. 
The two original numbers are right, but my conclusion is wrong. 
You're not removing outputs that don't change hands. Everyoner's telling you that, wakey wakey.
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:20:34
Yeah we all know that's the output volume.
That's not the correct variable to use. 
You've told like 12 people they have 'mental problems' now
You have a 'Took no courses in computer science' problem.
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:03:11
That is the analogy I'm going for.
You got 1 of the inputs wrong. It's Price * Something. It is NOT Price*Output 
Your own source blockchain.info says you're wrong.
And you're downvoted to hell and back and people are making fun of you on Twitter. 
Go to sleep Josiah.

Psst, I don't think you can get the definition of velocity of money wrong and then try to pretend to be the 'educated' one 2 posts later, fyi.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:30:30
I think what people are trying to tell you, and have actually demonstrated in a few posts above is that no, you would not find a similar pattern.   
In one of the examples above the 3 ratios would be 0.83, 0.75 and 0.76 What sort of pattern is that?   
And even if it was true and they moved linearly... if it was 0.8 and 0.7.... is the next 0.6 or is the next 0.6125? You're trying to find these 'patterns' in 2 data points, it's ridiculous.

What an idiotic statement, the bubble already burst. It might come back later on, but how is it not a bubble to crash to 1/8th the value?

I gotta vote the wobble one sounds dumber. "The market is fake" is extra retarded.

That was over 150% of their earnings that year, so many people were fired and they had to hire over 2,000 people globally to staff their new anti-money laundering department. 
That's a huge amount of money lost
