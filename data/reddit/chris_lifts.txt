Ooh this makes sense. Do they target empty blocks on purpose? Like, can they see how big/full a block is and mine it?
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:36:25
On litebit.EU you pay 3.50 for the block chain (pay nothing above a certain amount) and 0.42 fee, so a total extra cost of 3.92 or 0.42.

Spend as much as you can afford to lose. There is always the chance that bitcoin goes down, in that case you lose money.

When will segwit be activated?
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:20:33
Or just don't fuck with the IRS... Don't paint bitcoin as a safe haven for criminals, I thought we were trying to get rid of that imago. Your brother messed up and pays for it.
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:03:31
I'm kind of new to this. What is so bad about mining empty blocks?
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:36:05
Maybe he is new and concerned. Wanting to know whether there has been an event that caused it is not a bad thing. You ignored answer is a bad thing.

Nopes. Not donating to you. Link to the site if this is legit.
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:28:39
He lies. Price of a bitcoin didn't double yesterday or today.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:01:48
Or they have invested in it. 
Also, there are 3 shadow banned comments in this thread, 3 out of 7...

Demand goes down, because a country with more than 1 billion people bans the exchanges that sell it. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:04:04
I believe they already banned them, but are allowed to be open till the 31st (not sure about the date).
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:42:18
Was more like 5% within a minute.    
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:27:54
Based on what?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:07:12
So, kind of exactly what he did, right?
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:10:14
Chilling in panic, first time with such a huge drop for me.

People do use it as a currency. How much of the money you have in your bank account do you spend and how much do you hold on to for interest or just for later? Bitcoins interest can be positive and negative, but it is mainly positive in the long run (for now). Having 1000 dollars worth of bitcoins now can be worth 1300 dollars in a week or two. This means that spending 5 bucks of bitcoins now on a coffee or sandwich means the same coffee or sandwich has cost you 7,50 after two weeks.

Quite sure being able to buy anything is a good thing, it is one of the reasons the euro exists. It makes trading with other countries easier.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:57:40
When is low? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:57:40
When is low? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:19:31
Or just through their parents...

Mistake not in title, but in picture. Real site no mistakes, you edit.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:00:33
Doubt that amount. That would mean all 21 million coins could be mined by 1000 people in just 70 hours.

It is already like 50 above 6k...
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:09:53
Ooh like 50 coins in total, not 50 coins per person... I may be slightly retarded
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:10:01
It becomes profit once you have paid back your investments. That is going to take a while in this meme.
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:51:29
Probably a scam :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:35:38
"Amount too small for send"
That is some broken English... Did you edit this or something? Fucks wrong with you?
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:49:47
I can't post pros because I am not involved a lot in bitcoin. I put money in it and hold. I don't check for all updates. For some reason I subbed to this sub and the other bitcoin sub and all I see is cons of segwit2x on this sub. So it won't be a surprise to only see cons.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:31:34
The irony though.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:17:37
My predictions for this thread is going to be deleted or mainly cons.

Your regret would only increase
