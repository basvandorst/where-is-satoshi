OK I'll take on this but I am an old school so I maybe wrong. I think that value has related with history, rarity, popularity, celebrity and the mixture of those kind that people are attracted to, not only related with the function.
Think about the value of arts. Some pieces of arts are valued in out the space and the reasoning alone can't explain it other than it must have something worth beyond what it looks.
Think about cars. The most expensive cars are not necesarilly the most pratically functioning cars.
The bitcoin started everything from nothing.
Nuff said.

I would never sell bitcoins that I bought.
This is something that I would carry for the rest of my life.
Bitcoin is the pride that I would keep to myself.

Also,  it seemed to me that larger the amount the faster it show up on trezor, due to the transaction fee that should be covered by miners who picks up the larger fee first, at least that's the way I am understanding.

I keep my bitcoin in trezor.
 
It feels secure and great to have bitcoins in my hand!

I started recently, too.
You could watch Andreas Antonopolous on youtube.  He convinced me on bitcoin.

I am a beginner here, too. Before I jumped on the bitcoin train,  I invested a fair amount of time on watching Andreas Antonopolous speaking about the future of the bitcoins on youtube and I became convinced that bitcoin is the future itself in the money form.

Yes,  I know it's gut-wrenching for the first time..
It wil work as long as you copied and pasted.

Buying bitcoin (it was at 7100 before thedrps) was one of the few achievements I had so far.. Yeah!

I checked Korean websites, but Koreans are not exposed to the information and new ideas on bitcoins that are commonly shared in English speaking countries.  They only move quick at the market as Korean newspaper advertise a new fab in the market which is up and coming.  
After the bitcoin cash crashed, some of my friend Koreans say that they are fed up with bitcoins already.

 I paid about 12 usd  in coinbase to transfer similar amonunt  yesterday and it took 48 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:31:32
If bitcoins are not working, why did you come here?
You wouldn't have to be here, if it hadn't worked.
I came here since they are working, LOL.

I am scared of height...
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:22:04
Comrades,  I love you guys!

I did the same thing 10 days ago when there was an "attack",  it took about 48 hours to show up.
It will show. No sweat!

I will remain as a hodler until it reaches $40,000 in a couple of years.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:10:12
 Same here!
I bought bitcoin at 7100 right before it droped and it was a hell of a rollercoaster for me and here we go!
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:38:40
yeah  there is fee and it is automatically taken off and the rest is tranferred.
Many think that the fee is high, but I am ok with it.

I didn't jump in the bitcointrain for the last several years because I am a serious investor and I saw the sign of serious investors that began to notice bitcoin for a mainstream  and their pattern of investments are rather long term, which will make this bitcoin phenominon work for a while now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:04:52
Great breakdown to show why bitcoin has difficulties.
Lessons to be learned;
1. Bitcoin has to RESTRICT only to the large value transaction in order to maintain a small blocksize.
2. Bitcoin has to invent a second denomination in order to handle a small valued large transaction using  a "disposable" block.
3. The disposable block should be archived.

Shamelessly honest and it hurts me!
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:32:34
Exactly that!

Since I am a Korean, (who lives in the US) I talked to other Koreans who used bitthum in Korea.
They don't share the ideology that we share here in bitcoin about decentralization. They were just promoted to buy afordable 'bitcoins' which was in fact, bitcoin cash.  After they all seemed to have mislead to this at the top price, they later were dumbfound when it plunged.
