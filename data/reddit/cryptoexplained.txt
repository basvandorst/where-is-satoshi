The main issue with cashing out is that an individual may need to recognize a short term capital gain (if their BTC appreciated and they sold within a year)

It is most likely just coincidence, but I have been seeing more major news coverage over the past month than all previous months this year. It seems this additional mainstream coverage has been driving more FUD in the market, which could have helped push this market correction we are seeing.

In addition, once the fork happens individuals will move Bitcoins back onto exchanges; which will cause additional market fluctuations, price swings and transaction delays.

As the landscape and crypto debit cards mature, there will be more people able to do it, but as of now it is too inconvenient

There has been a lot of confusion in the market with UASF, UAHF, Segwit2x, Bitcoin Cash etc. over the past month. However, the news about Bitcoin Cash is relatively recent, coming out on 7/25. 
It was only very recently that Coinbase explicitly stated that they will not support Bitcoin Cash. Thus, this is driving further confusion on what individuals should do.

Thank you for the thoughtful response.
While I agree that the typical innovators dilemma would be faced largely by applications, rather than protocols. I wouldn't say protocols would be immune to facing the same issue.
This happened to be apparent when Bitcoin miners would not adopt SegWit a few months ago (though have since changed). If they did not adopt the new technology, Bitcoin as a protocol would have fell behind from a technological standpoint.
Separately, I do believe Bitcoin will maintain its current use case as a digital gold and grow over time. However, there is a reason institutional investors such as Polychain are looking at protocols outside of Bitcoin. They believe they can find higher returns in other protocols.
With the recent news of how an analyst believes a Bitcoin will grow to $50k, I think it is appropriate to see different points of view to not get caught up in a hype cycle.

I tested a very small amount 3+ hours ago and it is still pending..

Thank you for your view point.
I agree with you that the current ~$3 transaction fee does not support widespread adoption for everyday goods (i.e. a cup of coffee). My view of what is likely to happen is that the transactions fees will increase over time and the low value transactions will be priced out of the market.
As the avg. Bitcoin transaction value is +$25k, those users would continue to use the technology even if fees started increasing significantly from their current level. Thus, I think the fees will creep up over time until they hit a resistance point from the avg. transaction value users. If that happens, the use case for low value transactions would be diminished.
What do you think is the most likely scenario?
