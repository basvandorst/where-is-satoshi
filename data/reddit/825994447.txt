I want some bitcoin transactions between the btcchina and the European Exchange (Tao Li) the price difference is very big.
This provides the opportunity, earn a little money, the general will help the Bitcoin community, because it bit currency prices all over the world level, which helps to make the Bitcoin more stable.
I am looking for someone who is willing to do so in the uk. You can buy a cheap currency in Europe, put them in China I, I sell for more money to Europe is more expensive. We will share in the 50 / 50 of the profit.
Of course, the biggest problem is the trust and a lot of people screaming scam. But I think, how to build enough trust between two people, do some reasonable transaction. If you are interested, give me a message, we can talk more about this plan, how to make it worthy of trust.
