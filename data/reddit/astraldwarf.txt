Thanks! It’s no impressionist lemon, but it’s pretty damn good.

I suspect this is profound, but I’m going to need to see it in a poster before I truly get it.

Yes, it’s the 7th dimension lizard people, with their chemtrail spraying.

Exactly. What the hell?

I guess it just seems like gold in this way. Like, someone went through the effort to dig it up, so that seems like some inherent value.

That’s a lot of single malt.

$400,000 seems a little too pricey for a wallet. But on the other hand, how many lambos do you really need?

Well, we “core whores” apparently have massive conspiracy powers, so I’m sure we can pull it off.

It's going to buy me a cup of coffee on the darknet, and some MDMA on NewEgg.com.

Yeah, this is what I mean. It's not real transactions?
