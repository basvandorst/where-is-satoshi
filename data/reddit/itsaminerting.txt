I believe lots of people are currently selling off Alts to buy into BTC for the predicted summer rise. There may also be people liquidating Alts to buy script ASICs.
99% of alts are copy coins and serve no real purpose. Everyone wants to be on board in case one goes to the moon. I do believe there will be a few surviving currencies because of the niche they have: an ASICs resistant coin, a tipping coin, a PoS and a darksend may all survive.

Bitcoin is the established market leader, it's years ahead of everyone else. The Altcoins fascinate me and with places like Crytsy, Poloniex and Mintpal they are so interchangeable with each other and BTC. It is great fun mining and trading them and there is always the memory that BTC went up 1000% so why can't XXX Altcoin do the same!
There are some fascinating concepts being tried out on the various different Altcoins. I can't see any of the copy coins surviving past a couple of years but things like Darkcoins Anonymous blockchain and Vertcoins - Script N (ASIC Resistance) have potential and could take them far.
There's no rule that says there can only be one winner. Sure BTC will be king but I think there's room for 2 or three more coins at the table. The free market will decide what coins can coexist.

You could try mining one of the GPU friendly alt coins like Vertcoin and then trade into BTC on an exchange

I would say lots of altcoin holders are selling and converting to BTC for the predicted summer rise. The increased selling pressure is keeping the price low. I think in the long run they'll rise too but will lag behind by a few months and never reach bitcoins success level

I've never used it before... show us how it's done

Would a hardfork make current ASICs useless?
With regards to double spend attacks being traceable, couldn't they trade the BTC into one of the Altcoins with Darksend to launder them and then slowly cash out?

Do you have a moment to discuss our savior coin, shitclonescamcoin?

Once all coins have been mined won't we have millions of dollars of ASIC hardware just working for transaction fees? Would this drive the price up massively?
