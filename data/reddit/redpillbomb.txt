What a terrible strategy lol
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:12:55
Shoulda SODL 9 months ago like Charlie Lee did. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:13:04
It's a worse case scenario. But still miners are preparing for it.
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:10:39
Cool, the bear market of 2014 lasted 18 months. We are 6 months into this bear market. Which means it has a long way to drop yet.
Down to about $1.5k if it follows the pattern you're predicting. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:51:15
Brace yourselves, big dump coming. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:07:12
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:26:27
I see some in the mining community are expecting and prepared for an ultimate floor of $980 in this cycle. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:33:13
The opposite of HODL is take profit when you're happy with what you've made. Greed is what prevents people from selling when they should.
Instead people should be satisfied with any profit they take, instead of being greedy and holding for a higher  price that may never come. Profit sure beats losing everything. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:23:16
No, you held too long. You're supposed to sell at the ATH, not hold through it until the next bust cycle.
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:49:38
A lot of the smart folks saw this coming and already got out in Dec and Jan. If anyone is still holding from 2012-2016 era, now is the time take profit. Of course selling in Jan would have been better, but selling now is better than waiting for it to hit $2k 
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:09:54
Cut your losses and sell
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:28:57
It's going to $2k. I've been saying this since January. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:04:31
Sub $2k
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:49:15
Hope you sold it all at $20k per btc otherwise you must feel a bit silly at all the money you could have had. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:34:28
Uhm if you bet it will go way down, why would you keep holding it? If you're sure it's going down, sell it now and buy back at a quarter of the price in a year from now.
But, who cares about logic, right?
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:53:25
What price did you buy at and when? 
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:12:20
Long way down still to come. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:28:29
Exactly. The bitcoin dollar price has been artificially inflated using tether. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:10:01
Bitfinex is possibly insolvent and will collapse soon. Price divergence is a classic symptom of this. Same happened with Mt Gox
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:10:28
Tether 
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:56:26
You paid over $32 in fees...
@_date: 2019-08-15 10:39:51
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:31:26
It could also drop to a third of its current value. Should've SODL. Like 6 months ago. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:59:09
It does sometimes seem like it, doesn't it...
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:37:41
If it follows previous trends, then it will dip to the peak of the last bubble, which was $1200.
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:53:58
You picked a really bad time to buy.
Critical support line was broken.
And Tether double spend vulnerability.
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:43:01
Hope you sold at somewhere between 15k and 20k then. That was your chance to have made some big profit. 
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:19:35
Yes it is. 
Currently £8200. 
The low a couple of hours ago was £7800
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:28:25
I think its going quite a bit lower. Probably down to $1500 over the next 12 months or so.
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:22:24
You mean you didn't sell in January?
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:30:39
Look at the 2014/2015 crash. It means that you should be looking to buy in Jan or Feb 2019 if you want the best price. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:36:07
On that basis it should go to just under 2k, or the peak of the last bubble which was $1200, since that's how this seems to work.
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:00:10
The people who sold at 20k are the people who bought it for $500 about 5 years ago. Do you blame them for this decision? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:19:54
$230 to $20,000 is better. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:08:50
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:35:46
It's actually massively inflationary. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:17:20
6 months ago...
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:08:02
It's alright, you don't understand the scam. That's ok too.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:35:01
And what happens to the price of bitcoin when there's no longer $3.5 billion tethers to wash trade with?
Bitcoin price has been artificially inflated for years.  When the tool that's propped up the price of bitcoin disappears, bitcoin price will collapse.
Insiders have realised this and bought up bitcoin, thus explaining the recent price hike. Now they are cashing out for real dollars, thus the crash. The end is surely near.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:27:52
Actually it confirmed that the fraud many people speculated was happening, is actually happening. 
And there is a court hearing next month. 
Tether could be about to implode.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:51:07
Actually it proved that 70% of Tether is backed with dollars, bitcoin or other crypto. 
Thus proving that they are using freely printed Tether (at zero cost), to buy bitcoin. Buying bitcoin with fake dollars increases buy pressure artificially which inflates or props up the price. Most volume is created by Tether (fake dollars) and not real dollars. 
Therefore it might well be going to 100k Tethers but if a Tether is worthless, then it won't mean very much. If that happens, bitcoin will be worthless. And it will be too late to extract any real dollars from the system.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:15:59
That's where tether comes in ��
Why buy bitcoin with real dollars when you can print your own Tether for free and prop up the price with fake dollars? ��
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:20:51
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:05:43
I don't think you understand the scam.
Just because you don't understand how it works, doesn't mean it isn't a scam.
For example, the Bernie Madoff fraud scam ran undetected for nearly 2 decades before it collapsed.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:22:22
It dropped to $4210 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:16:22
Biggest Ponzi in history?
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:36:18
The people that had money on Mt.Gox wished they had cashed out to a bank for a year at $1242 and bought in a year later at $200. This is the same. Sell now for $3500 and buy in a year for $800 or less. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:43:46
No blood in the street until btc at $500
Patience 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:26:06
A lot of smart people sold in January 2018, my man. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:28:09
What happens if you have a channel with small funds in it, that you can't spend? Like random cent values? A channel with 63 cents in it. Do you lose that money forever? Where do these left over funds go?
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:49:37
Oh you mean like Chinese New Year?
Got it ������
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:49:20
It's a blocksize problem. Blocks were full. And Lightning doesn't seem like a workable solution at all...
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:13:46
Mate, everyone sold a long time ago
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:59:16
Yes the price was pumped up illegally with fake dollars. Price was totally artificial. True price is much lower than current price. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:59:53
Oh man those days when bitcoin gained $1500 in a day.
Now it's losing 1k in 12 hours !
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:01:40
People also said that it would never go under 8k or 6k. Then it would never go under 5k. Or under 4k.
Yet apparently you're now saying it will never go under 2k. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:03:49
Under $2k by new year, at this rate. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:08:15
When you say cash, do you mean real dollars or fake tether dollars?
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:11:00
Did you also think it would never go below $6k? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:58:19
Many people warned everyone of this in late 2017. 
Bitcoin price is a scam. Sell now while it's still worth something. Because it's going down. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:37:58
In January 2018 people said bitcoin would never go to $3k. But it has. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:37:54
Admit it, you should have SODL !
Like 11 months ago 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:30:34
All of bitcoins forks and alts are diluting bitcoins worth. Or in other words,  inflation. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:09:46
Sure thing. People have been saying this at every $1000 drop from $20k.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:55:56
Of course they did. 
Volume and price action was totally fraudulent and artificially pumped with fake dollars on tether exchanges. 
This means the true value of bitcoin is far lower than current price. Probably sub-$1k. Sorry to say, anyone that bought in 2017-2018 has been scammed. Sell now before the house of cards collapses. Tether is buckling and can no longer hold dollar parity. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:04:06
What about the 2014-2015 crash that followed?
 $1242 to $175. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:33:19
Sell ! 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:02:22
So you knew 20k was grossly over-valued, yet you didn't take profit at that price. Instead you held onto an asset that has lost 80% of its value since then. 
That's not investing. That's losing money at an exponential rate. But keep doing you, I guess...
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:10:38
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:42:07
It's $5400 now lol
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:22:49
Sell ! It's going to get a lot worse 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:48:06
Yeah seriously get your money the hell outta there. It's not safe. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:45:49
Not lucky, smart. Anyone paying attention to previous boom-bust cycles, knew this was coming. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:09:55
The last dip.... before the next dip
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:58:18
If you experienced what bitcoin transaction fees were like in December 2017, then you'd know that bitcoin is completely unfeasible as a currency or payment platform. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:09:05
Does a bear shit in the woods?
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:02:51
How's that working out for you?
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:27:04
Customers did not cash out the dollars, but the exchanges did. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:32:30
It's probably gonna go to $500
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:11:50
US Justice Dept are investigating Bitfinex and Tether for artificially pumping the bitcoin price with fake dollar tokens in 2017.
The true price/demand for bitcoin is therefore much lower. Sub-$1k most likely. So everyone is getting out while they can. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:19:44
Ok but it's probably going under 1k 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:48:04
Absolutely. Many smart people predicted 2k btc in January. And sold accordingly.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:18:57
Tether just issued $50 million from thin air. That's why the price had a small pump. Their manipulation is blatant now. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:11:01
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:42:41
More like $1500 to $2000
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:44:56
The person you bought from lost the gains made from 2015. And the person you sold to, will lose their investment if the price goes down. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:23:15
Popcorn time! 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:40:59
Better yet, sell your bitcoin and withdraw your dollars out to a real Bank while you still can. 
A lot of exchanges are going to Gox. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:39:11
Prepare for sub $1k bitcoin
This thing is done 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:31:16
Actually a LOT of people sold in January. It was obvious that a big crash was coming. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:55:09
What would an 83% crash from $10,000 be?
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:22:13
So it was instant, free and secure? 
Sounds like the future of money. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:01:35
Strong support at $500.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:04:27
Yeah sub 1k for sure. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:34:41
It wasn't adoption/tech that was supporting the price. It was Tether propping it up. The house of cards is coming down now. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:12:06
It's cryptographically impossible for bitcoin to go under $6k
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:33:36
If it matches 2015, the low this time will be $1900. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:13:12
If everyone sold at $40k, who's going to be buying?
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:14:11
There's no guarantee that btc recovers or goes parabolic again
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:06:11
Personally I would get your dollars back to a real Bank ASAP because it's very likely that Tether exchanges are insolvent. And when they go under, they will crash the entire market, possibly bringing other exchanges with them. 
Better to get your funds safe. And wait for this mess to blow over. Then in a year or so, re-evaluate and consider buying back in. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:12:26
Sorry for your losses
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:10:17
If that's the case, the best time to sell was in January. 
The second best time to sell is NOW. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:43:57
2014 and 2015 was worse.
This crash won't be over until you don't even care anymore. The fact that you cared enough to ask this question, means there is still quite a long way to drop. Expect $2k or less over the next year.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:21:08
Nah. Under 1k is tempting. 
People are predicting $800. Some people even expect $300
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:13:08
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:08:13
There's no guarantee that bitcoin will ever recover from this
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:15:02
In that case, not many of those left. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:42:32
And if you wait for 1k you'll increase your holding even more. $3500 is still over valued. It's going much much lower. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 07:16:06
But let's be honest, almost no retailers accept bitcoin. You can't pay taxes in bitcoin. And so what good as money is it, if you can't spend it? The only thing you can do with it is speculate on its value and convert it back to fiat. So it fails the test as a money. 
It's more like an elaborate gambling, speculative Ponzi, than money. Even when humans first used seashells as money, they were more widely accepted for commerce than what bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:08:04
How does BTC differ from being a fictional idea with no backing? I mean it's basically the same as any alt then. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 10:19:58
Storing a key in a public database doesn't have inherent value. Proven by the fact that there are thousands of alts that replicate Bitcoins functionality. Some of those alts, the coins might be worth 0.1 cent and it can do exactly the same as 1 bitcoin at $7000. So what's the point of bitcoin then....
 Coins only have speculative value in the sense that you think you can resell your tokens to someone else later for a higher price. This basically makes it a game of *"greater fools"* or what is also known as a Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:25:41
lol anti Trump shills get everywhere 
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:48:52
How much would you have made if you had sold on Dec 11 2017 instead?
That would have been a smarter decision...
