The Rothschild family could buy up every bitcoin if they wanted to. The amount of money they have in that family is beyond Godly.

There was a rumor, keep that in mind, that said something like they have a slush fund in the 10s of trillions. I'd believe it, but again, just a rumor.

According to Coinfan it'll drop to 8975 at the lowest possible in February and then proceed to skyrocket to 23000 minimum by the end of the year.

Pretty much all the major world families could easily tank any company if they wanted to. They'd rather invest and watch it moon before tanking it and repeating. Even Buffet alone caused WalMart stock to tumble before. The power these people and families have is outside of common understanding.

I make 4 purchases a year with bitcoin, but I always buy for that and immediately send instead of dipping into what I have.

Long term it's a pretty good time to buy. Next year it could end up being 10k

I'm sitting at 2.6342 BTC. If I never sold all the previous times, I'd have around 15 BTC.

Reminds me of that fake martial arts guy that could beat people using the force or whatever they called it.

This implies I'll ever have kids.

Might actually buy something on black friday for the first time ever, online of course because screw fighting crowds. It's probably going to be a few 6$ Blu-Ray movies. I put 600$ minimum into bitcoin every month anyway so I don't have to choose.

This is reminds me how you're suppose to declare any untaxed online purchases on your taxes. For example if you buy a bunch of shit on Amazon that is sold outside your state, it isn't taxed. You're supposed to remember the total amount you spent and put it on your taxes. Who the fuck even does this?
