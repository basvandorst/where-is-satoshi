So you believe he's telling his reporters to write negative stories? Sitting in back offices telling his "guys" to come out with puff pieces that slam bitcoin?

I'm sure it's possible, but not as widespread as you may believe. Also the term "media" gets a bit hazy with the advent of social media and the fact that anyone can start (buy) a website and start writing a blog and call themselves a reporter.
With that said, we can argue semantics all we want. However, I know that [Mike Bloomberg has a lot more on his plate]( than to worry about getting his reporters to write damning commentary about bitcoin.

He's been reporting at Bloomberg News for 7 years. He's not "some guy" he's an actual reporter.

It is at $8,344 today. Just curious are you snapping up as many bitcoin as you can if you believe this? Should rise to 19K as you predicted.

It does - in the article.
Last week, Judge Legrome Davis of the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania, affirmed that decision, saying “the coins in question were not lawfully removed from the United States Mint.”

That would be true if the government was the painting creator. The Mint minted the coins.

Not lawfully removed = stolen.

The cashier, who worked at the Mint, "managed to save some".
You know, like putting them in his pocket and walking out of the Mint? Not like he said, "Excuse me guys, I am going to take these coins out of the Mint...for myself!"
Because you can't do that. You work at Mint. You don't own the coins at the Mint. The coins that were, you know, recalled.
Translation for you - he stole the coins. He "sold" stolen coins to the collector. Just because that collector died doesn't change the fact that they are still...stolen coins.

Let's say you own a car. A rare 1968 Mustang.
I steal the car. Sell it to someone else.
That person tries to register the car that they bought from the thief. Do they get to keep the car? Do they get compensated for the car? 
No. If anything - they need to find the thief to get compensation.
