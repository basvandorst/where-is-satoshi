What can they do with a pic of your ID? If someone wanted they can find most of that info anyways. It's verified through third party too. I'd give it a try, or you can buy through Reddit venders 
@_date: 2016-08-02 09:12:27
Chill buddy. Your money is fine, circle is shit anyways
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:53:42
What could they do? 
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:30:02
This. Coinbase or circle is the only two you can buy instantly with credit or debit for a small fee
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:05:32
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:01:12
Did your wife leave you for a guy with coin? Lol 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:38:58
You can survive days without food. You can live in Denver with no car. Sell your car if it’s that dire. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:12:17
I agree with OP. What’s your counter argument? Just saying no looks a little unintelligent.
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:04:02
Start a processor business 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:50:59
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:02:00
Redditor for 3 days. Posts in forgery forums. Hmm.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:44:49
Get into credit card debt then. There’s people worse off than you. Be happy you have a job and roof over your head
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:40:11
Yeah, it’s basically fixed. About the same price to send a coin as it is .01 right now 
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:28:48
Probably will be set in USD and you pay off the current price of BTC at that time.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:41:22
What a crash !
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:58:36
No. Manufacturers are taking advantage of the high demand and making them in bulk. Easy to scale. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:36:40
I didn’t say everyone had to agree, that’s why i asked for others thoughts. It’s just crazy how big of an echo chamber Reddit’s bitcoin community seems. When it’s up it’s going to the moon, but when it’s down it’s dead in the water.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:30:51
This is really trash 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:14:02
That was a glitch. Price never went to 9k
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:05:29
You shouldn’t go 50% of your money in on any investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:34:03
Wouldn’t be worth considering transaction fees 
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:14:49
Agreed. Many of us have been through much worse. He can use all the time on the internet to get another job or do something useful. I’m a helping type but no chance with this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:51:55
I’d try selling for cash in person then. Craigslist works for me just make sure you meet in a public/safe area
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:42:55
You’re wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:19:37
Do you think a passphrase is required for full security of my BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:33:25
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:08:21
Well said 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:59:55
Lmao. Your whole comment history is in defense of BCH or roger ver and 90% active in r/Btc. Wouldn’t be surprised if you were a paid shill. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:55:13
Oh okay. Thanks I don’t really understand the whole idea of them. 
Could they potentially store the keys before selling the device and later try to regain access?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:27:08
Craigslist 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:39:42
Because they’ve always chugged along as more of a silver and bronze to our gold. Bch gets pumped out of nowhere with an asshole named roger ver, takes the name and all of a sudden is the big hype. ETH and LTC have waited their turn. Not a holder of either, but I don’t mind them being there as a “little brother”, while bch is trying to get the gold medal.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:35:55
It never was 9k. That was a bug.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:56:19
Post an ad on Craigslist selling BTC for cash. Thats what I’ve done and it works
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:01:05
Redditor for 3 days- hi Roger Ver shill 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:13:27
Ok thank you very much.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:50:27
And what’s stopping people from entering random keys until they break into someone’s wallet? Do you need to enter the BTC address as well or just the keys?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:51:20
Could they possibly keylog the hard drives when they sell the product and take those keys?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:55:34
I did. It’s sad that he’s trying to be the face of a project that was meant to be decentralized and for the benefit of the general users. I’m not sure whether he’s doing it for power, or money at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:09
Yes. Not healthy 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:48:29
How exactly do you do that? You just enter the bitcoin address then the seed as the password on a different device?
What stops a company like Trezor from having the ability to steal peoples seeds/bitcoin?
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:14
Hashtag don’t buy shitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:13:08
I did. It doesn’t really mention what happens if their company went out of business.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:37:40
If people cash out and price falls there will always be people who will buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:36:04
No clue. Only have had the Trezor 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:12:34
I’m a big fan of the Trezor. Used online wallets for about a year due to fear of ignorance with hardware wallets. Was very easy to switch and user friendly. What sold me was the fact that if I lose it, I have my private keys which can recover the BTC anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:54:21
Agreed, however, we need to do something about the fee size. I think the transaction spamming has really radicalized it though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:47:52
That’s fine, go down to the “other bank” option 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:54:15
Yeah, shitty. Coinbase charges fees anyways. I usually sell for market value or above in cash 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:58:37
Cool. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:49:32
Ok. So to access those bitcoin they’d need the keys (that only I would know) if someone stole the hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:01:40
You mean shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:21:44
Your last comment before this was defending yourself as a shill. Hmm.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:10:22
Thanks. Is the passphrase the pin used to access my Trezor wallet?
Seed is the 24 words?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:45:51
You’re simply wrong. Not trying to be condescending, it’s just not true. It was a glitch on coinbase and coinbase never officially allowed buying or selling at that price. Research a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:46:57
Link your bank
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:58:33
Awesome. Thank you for clearing up all my concerns. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:20:53
Well said.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:06:19
1090 now
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:49:48
Anything is possible now
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:43:37
You sure?
@_date: 2018-10-11 06:14:47
Was insulting him necessary? Could’ve gotten your point across and he was just raising conversation 
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:35:37
Can you explain to me how Trezor works? It it user/noob friendly?
@_date: 2017-01-28 20:39:25
Are the coins lost?
@_date: 2018-10-11 06:13:10
Jinxed it 
@_date: 2017-01-28 20:51:50
Will they for sure send? How can i be sure?
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:20:27
This helped a lot. I'm just nervous about the BTC getting lost somehow or screwing my self over. Thank you so much 
@_date: 2019-02-12 07:07:05
Yes. And many more the last few years. Nitrogen is the only one that is consistent and honorable. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:13:09
Okay black cow 
@_date: 2019-02-10 11:35:12
Don’t listen to any of these. Www.nitrogensports.eu is the best. Also check out r/sportsbook
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:48:18
Where’s your source? Where’s their source?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:52:24
Correct. Make sure you use google authenticator to protect your coins
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:10:56
It’s $300 away.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:16:21
It’s not like cash. It’s more digital gold. It seems like a satirical post since you sold thousands of dollars worth of BTC (irreversible) for a reversible currency to an untrusted user
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:15:14
Don’t. If someone stores the private keys to that wallet you’re fucked. Buy a fresh one from trezor 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:49:51
So you paid rent to a place you’ve never been with an anonymous and irreversible currency and didn’t physically see the apartment? Sounds like you’re screwed
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:56:10
Because the “struggle” is artificial. If you’ve been checking the patterns, every time it dips and its proclaimed dead, a new all time high shows. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:12:40
Is this satire?
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:30:29
You seem very convinced, so you shouldn’t buy in!
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:56:08
I commented that there’s no telling anyone has 1M btc, you said it was rumored that someone did so I emphasized that it’s rumored and therefore backed by zero evidence.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:45:57
There’s no telling that anyone has 1,000,000 btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:50:33
“May” “is believed”
It’s a rumor. There’s no concrete evidence 
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:51:19
Don’t do it, sounds scammy
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:48:45
I didn’t say that all other coins are a scam, I’m saying this is what drives others to create these currencies in hope of them being the “next big thing”, and people latch onto these pump and dumps thinking they’re the next bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:14:53
“Plunged” to a new all time high
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:47:31
Coinbase is fine for a wallet. As long as you don’t have a crazy amount of BTC you’ll be safe. People here over exaggerate the need to get a hardware wallet. Only difference is when you send a transaction on coinbase you’re essentially telling them to send the BTC so the transfers may be a bit slower.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:07:23
That’s not true- there can easily be value as a placeholder. Bitcoin is more and more being considered digital gold instead of a currency. It’s starting to come out that btc may not be at best use in form of a currency due to the tx fees and confirmation time. This is what drives scamcoins like BCH, coin can continue to rocket even if not used as a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:00:16
Yeah such a dive. Already back to 10,300
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:58:46
Evidence to make assumptions that he has x amount of BTC, the number you pulled is arbitrary and even if he did have that amount he could’ve been selling them off over the years. My bet is that no one has anywhere near that amount.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:01:53
Don’t accept PayPal from anyone without a large amount of trust. It’s simple to reverse without any questions.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:51:50
It’s rumored
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:26:13
Correct to all, free withdrawals and instant 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:46:34
Don’t listen to any of these others. 
Use nitrogensports.eu
You deposit and bet in BTC only, the others convert your BTC to usd as soon as you deposit.
@_date: 2019-01-21 23:58:49
That’s not pessimism, it’s just unintelligent. BTC will always be worth something, since the black market will always be able to stay under the radar with it. Then you have the true believers (in the technological aspect) that would buy upon a certain price point. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:16:55
No one thinks it’s going to become the “next currency” and take over the dollar. Think of it more as digital gold.
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:46:27
The low on the week is $9800. It’s $10,000 currently. That’s 2% fluctuation, I wouldn’t call that a dip. I doubt coinbase was out to get you for a minuscule amount of money when they’re liable for millions if not hundreds of millions. Please elaborate on your other concerns. You posted that they were sketchy on the maintenance post, so I assumed you were referring to that.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:27:31
Chill out buddy. Stop taking your shitty day out on this guy. The “eff no” was enough.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:52:09
You saying people are petty and a cancer yet support bcash speaks for itself 
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:30:12
You seem mad dude. Unless you dumped your shitcoin earlier you shouldn’t be. It’s a straight scam. Don’t talk about b cash or promote r BTC in here
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:09:49
It’s fair to hold that opinion from your personal experiences, but the explanation for it seeming to be unavailable for purchase just may be because traffic is too high for the servers. I don’t think it’s intentional malice. I’ve been a client with them for over a year with no issues. About the insider trading claim, I’d need a source and to research more into that before commenting. Anyways- I think in terms of being trustworthy and responsible for my coin, coinbase poses no threat. Best of luck 
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:59:05
It’s not that you visit other sites you’ve brought your support here by saying something positive about a known scam site bitcoin.com. 
Lmfao exactly try to mimic the real coin and then say it’s legit. You’re a fraud dude. I’ve been in BTC much longer than you have 
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:35:37
Yes. You’re promoting scam site bitcoin.com and trying to ask for open discussion here. This forum is for real bitcoin so I think you’re the one spreading cancer aka any other coin here. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:20:07
Doesn’t require much to shill for Roger Ver. Gtfo of this sub with your pro shitcash talk 
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:20:05
How exactly is a scheduled maintenance sketchy?
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:07:16
Why is this here? Spam
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:29:28
Reddit for a day. Get out of here with your alt talk
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:07:48
Sell on Craigslist instead
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:06:05
Yeah. This kid thinks he can come in here and spread positive stuff about his shitcoin. Should be banned 
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:04:57
Huge activity in btc and bcash subs. Lmao. Shill 
@_date: 2016-05-27 01:32:04
Hello $10 free BTC with a $100 purchase at coin base, any questions reply or msg me! ty
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:39:01
Agreed with most of your points. Well said.
@_date: 2016-07-27 04:56:41


Sent :) yeah i got it and then they re-sent it and it appeared
let me know when you get it
@_date: 2016-07-25 08:08:36
Did you check mine out? Its from blockchain is the sending, coinbase is receiving
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:22:29
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-07-27 01:56:42
Ok I will check now
@_date: 2016-07-27 03:16:16
You here?
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:05:49
What if they say they already paid?
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:25:19
Thanks for this work. But what if they say they havent received the funds back to their wallet and won't send another payment?
@_date: 2016-07-25 09:13:11
that 1 cent was to test if it was a problem with just that first transaction. apparently neither went through.
if it was dust limits, im assuming that means too many transactions at once, would i still get my funds? im hoping theyre not lost.
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:28:33
No, I've dealt with them numerous times in the past and never had this problem. Thank you for that info, I will try it now. Also going to tip you $5 in BTC once this all gets resolved. Thanks again 
@_date: 2016-07-26 00:13:39
Np. I see it on the list as still unconfirmed after 24 hours. Do you see that?
The 0.1363095 BTC payment
@_date: 2016-07-27 03:25:31
Whats your address? I really want to show appreciation for what you've done. Really it is unprecedented. Ive never had someone help me this much for nothing
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:28:38
Also they use blockchain as their wallet
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:48:10
Thank you for your help. Essentially they're saying they don't have the funds in their account and won't send again until they do. Do you know how long this could take for them to receive the funds back? I'm mostly worried I'm going to lose the BTC forever
@_date: 2016-07-25 14:04:16
How do I do that? 
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:14:04
So what happens from here? Does the funds go back to their account? Theyre missing the money from their account. Should I just wait ?
@_date: 2016-07-25 07:43:38
ok ty for assurance
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:43:31
I pm'd you
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:58:37
I was paid from someone using block chain I linked the transaction here already
