They blatantly bought loads of Bcash, supposidly they  were not integrating Bcash till much later on l. So they bought bcash up at a discount. This development should have been months away, then they came out with the sledgehammer integration.

Initially it was meant to be months away.

I know what it means. And the Bcash thing was definitely insider trading. Change the out of date context from security to crypto and it fits perfectly, just the regulations haven't caught up yet  . Just because there hasn't been a law drawn up against an immoral act, don't make it moral

What you just say about 12 days. Smells fishy. Why bring it forward. Dodgy decision making IMO

Insider trading Bcash

Exactly. Depends on the amount of transactions in the LN. The ledger will only show the first and last transaction on record, everything inbetween 1000+ transactions would be invisible to everyone except the nodes involved in the LN. Decentralisation of these nodes makes Anonymity pretty perfect if you're not the first or last transaction.

Don't see why Monero would be needed as thousands or millions of transactions would occur and only the first and last transaction would be recorded in the ledger. That's pretty good Anonymity.

Plasma will do for Ethereum what LN does for Litecoin and Bitcoin regarding speed and reduction in transaction costs. Atomic swaps, no.

In real simple language. What does this mean?
