Unless the prostitute rips you off. You pay and she disappears. Or her pimp beats her and makes her log on her phone and transfer her BTC.

Maybe they do day trading type stuff and need to be able to exchange it for other currencies without waiting around to transfer it.
Otherwise, yeah the average person doesn't have the capacity to really understand Bitcoin unless they spend a lot of time reading about it.

Well you'd have to understand bitcoin to know how to store it properly.

I only copied and pasted the key so it couldn't be a keylogger. Definitely possible that there was a Trojan on my computer but I had stored the same text file with the key for a few days before putting it on Dropbox and it happened almost instantly once I uploaded it.
I'm not saying Dropbox was hacked. It's very possible I used the same username and password on other accounts. What I am saying is that there is definitely software that recognizes private keys and grabs whatever coins are on them automatically.

It's complicated to the point where it would take a group of people and a savant who had spent a large amount of time working with encryption. But DARPA did find for, so who knows if Bitcoin was a similar project that they wrote under a pseudonym.

No I did not.

Depends on what kind of heists we're talking about if you're saying the biggest in history. Corrupt politicians steal hundreds of billions a year globally.

So if Mt. Gox was actually coming back and had all the bitcoins they're supposed to have...... then the employees would be buying every last one of these bitcoins, right? I mean it's potentially free money. But instead an employee or someone who found out what they were doing decided to sell a large amount..... That's a bad sign. Makes me think that the end of Mt. Gox is nigh.

So can anyone explain this who Mt Gox situation? From my understanding they shutdown withdrawals because supposedly some people were using an exploit to trick the system into thinking the withdrawal never went trhough.
People think they really did this because they are bankrupt though right? Where do they think the money went? Bad investments? Stolen? 
So now bitcoin is continuing to makeup excuses so they don't have to reveal that they don't have peoples' bitcoins. Correct? That's where we are now.
If someone has a link to an explanation or something I'd really appreciate it.
