Does anyone have advice on what external hard drive to use? 
Trying to find one with a dedicated power supply but it's proving harder than I thought. Every one I find seems to just be a portable external hard drive that doesn't require an external power source.

Yeah I agree with you on this particular comment. But I will say, I've been considering creating a new account just for crypto monitoring (so subscribing to only crypto subreddits and dropping all my other interests on that account) and when I do that as soon as I comment on anything crypto related I'm going to get flagged as a "redditor for 1 month" or whatever and immediately my opinion will be questioned. It's the only reason I haven't created that account actually...

Thank you. I bought another $100 today. If I lose it, well who cares.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:19:10
Fair point. *Buying more at 9k*

Well I only invest what I'm willing to lose, so if it does ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I sold in 2017 when I had enough to pay off all my student debt, refinanced my house two months later when my credit score soared and dramatically improved my life. People still don't believe me until I show them the transactions and even then the response is usually "well you got lucky, it's a scam." 
No, I just wasn't greedy. And no it is not a scam, it's just technology you don't understand. Buying back in now, have nowhere near the same amount of coin I used to but I have faith that it will continue to be a good long term investment.

Blockchain is (was) a new theory and technology. Whether or not bitcoin continues to exist and hold value, blockchain is here to stay. In my opinion the best use case where it is currently being applied is in companies’ supply chains. Do some research on it you’d be fascinated to find out how many applications blockchain technology, which was started by bitcoin, has. Talk to a supply chain professional (the people I sell consulting services to) and ask them about blockchain technology. Not here for a debate though, I’m off to look at funny memes and gifs while sitting on the toilet.

Honestly, I pay my accountant to do that for me and make sure it’s correct. From my understanding on what he explained to me, it varies based on how much $ was made per transaction. I’m not going to say what bracket I was in from what I sold because I think that’s getting a little too personal with posting my finances online, but it was more than I expected.

Hah! I am one of the few that actually paid my capital gains taxes. Idk I own a house I don’t mess around with that stuff. Not gunna lie though it hurt when tax season came around. Was way more than I expected

I tried to take German in college (I'm American) because Spanish and French were already full. It was so hard. Plus, according to my professor I speak bastardized English-German, with the accent of a (sorry not PC) homosexual Frenchman. She couldn't stop laughing during my first oral exam and then told me what I sounded like after and honestly I found it pretty funny too. I think she gave me a C just to get me out of her damn class...

Woohoo imperial system!
"Sir, how many inches should be in a foot? 10?"
"No 12."
"But sir, 10 would be more easily divisible."
"Yeah but ours would go to 12."

Thanks for the reply. I'm leaning towards your method and building my own wallet now.

Ok so I've done a few basic builds on a raspberry pi (the original though) and here's where I don't follow on security. Unless you write your own software, how can you be sure the wallet software you are downloading comes from a trustworthy source and really is a bitcoin wallet software? Not a programmer and bought my first bitcoin on Coinbase abt a month ago so please excuse my ignorance if I'm missing something, I'm just trying to get into the hardware wallet market to protect my shit and everything seems sketch...
