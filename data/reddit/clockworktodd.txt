you didnt even draw it.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:32:36
hahaha its fun because the companies that require KYC dont care about someone being terrorist, they care that the guy won't submit a chargeback in the same minute he receives the btc.

So when i said playing with numbers i mean, you don't hold actual bitcoin there, you are betting on the price going down or up.   
**Swap is** an interest fee that  is  either paid or charged to you at the end of each trading day. So for example if you keep long term trade at some point the swap can go higher than the actual profit and you will be on minus. Because the Swaps are charged every day, during the weekend the price is double (but this you have to confirm with plus 500)   
I am sorry but i prefer to give you advise related to the trading processes and terms, but not to recommend you company where you probably will loose your money.
@_date: 2019-07-30 12:04:42

i was wondering today... they made 100000 interviews with the guy who payed for the pizza, but what about the person that received the BTC ? Is he HODLing ? If not when he sold?
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:18:44
I am 100% sure that bulgarian people won't see shit or feel any different about this bitcoins. I am 100% sure that someone either will either already stole them.
@_date: 2019-07-04 12:10:02
if you want to exchange bitcoin daily you have a lot of choices ... poloniex, bitfinex, binance ... a lot of exchangers, just check whatever suits your needs and try yourself with amount that you allow yourself to loose. At the end of the day you might have good results also. We all had ups and downs with the trading...
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:43:10
i didnt moved mine for even longer... so what... its there :)

@_date: 2019-07-10 07:13:27
many of the holders will say good bye to all or part of their btc at exact moment when the price is on a good level for them.
@_date: 2019-07-04 10:41:15
you are playing with numbers there you don't have actual bitcoin with plus 500.   
You will pay SWAPS for keeping the trade opened for more than 24 hours, it's not the same as binance or poloniex lets say. You can make money there but 99% from the people don't. However it's your decision.   
Good luck.

In this case nobody can help you, you can use it as a lesson for yourself and don't fall on scams next time.   
There is no such thing as coin recovery hackers or agency so do not fall on this bullshit too.   
Know that once you send coins somewhere THEY ARE GONE.

let them sell, we will buy and sell it back later for premium to the same chinese =\]
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:44:10
you shouldn't i have many friends that don't support bitcoin, have different religion or sexuality. Supporting Bitcoin is a choice! You don't HAVE to do anything. If you put some money and expected to see only green candles after this you are on the wrong place. If you invested for the long term - then such things shouldn't bother you.
Decide what you want to do...

You can't teach people how to trade crypto, you can explain how the platform works but advising when/what to buy/sell is totally different story. 
You are saying that will leave scammers naked but the way you wrote it it sounds like scam.

10% ROI DAILY sounds like scam.   
ask her how much you should get with the invested already money and wait for it
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:28:35
Depends on your country... and if the government knows that you have btc. There is ways to hide it anyway, thats why you can answer for yourself.
@_date: 2019-08-09 14:31:42

I don't think it's good for bitcoin that there is McAfees  face all around. He said that for some hype and that's it. Everybody waiting something to happen because he is a man of a word or what? The end of next year he will post some bullshit that he typed "bircoin" or something like that. 
The old gangster is looking for followers, nothing more.

no such things as keeping multiple coins safe on exchange... get yourself tresor or ledger and store your coins there, the amount you will use for trading you can put on the exchange (keep on your mind that you can loose this amount not only from trading)

I am also on the BTC train hoping for the best, but historical analysis is not correct all the time, you can make 2 different graphs look the same if you implement some proper tools for this. I am not sure that BTC will make the same moves like before, however i hope so.

My bank doesn't offer any Zelle, but is happy to charge me 50 eur for a swift.

with wire transfer its easy, with credit card ... no one will go without KYC since you can chargeback the money right after you receive bitcoins.

There is tones of companies that will buy your Bitcoin for cash or wire transfer without kyc

@_date: 2019-09-25 10:28:31
once i can buy what i need
@_date: 2019-05-21 10:59:40
why dont you submit a chargeback?
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:55:13
if you deposited by credit card, they can refund the amount without any KYC, by providing them with your KYC you agree with their terms and conditions and they can screw you ) on the other side the chb from the bank will take more time but, there is more chance that you will take your money back.
