Wait.. im not saying they wanna stop it.. they love it. They want in. Lets say JP pushes it down in price but doesnt crash it.. buys a bunch and then link its to their banks. It would make it more desirable to normal folks who dont understand bitcoin.

Thats true. Its a great product. Truly revolutionary. All i am saying is.. here comes the big boys. I posted that chart and i probably should have noted that i disagree about leaving bitcoin. I do agree that the big boys are talking bitcoin at bilderberg for damn sure though.

I sold out at $19k. Ill get back in when it bottoms out. I knew i shouldnt have posted because any post that tells people they are gonna lose money is scary but you can prevent it and profit later. Think of the people who didnt buy Facebook when it dropped below $20 and then the powers that be propped it up and its now at $189 despite being caught dropping info.

Well as someone who is good at accumulating wealth ill say this.. bitcoin will be driven down by mainly JP Morgan. They will buy it in bulk and then connect it to their banks to make it more “legit” to the commoners so to speak. If you think Jamie Dimon wont/cant do this.. then lose your money. Better to plan for it and work with it like people did with the facebook swan dive.

Yes it is. And its not going away. Im saying that major players are gonna be joining in and influence it. Gas couldnt go from $3 to $1 per gallon without fuckery. Why would anyone think bitcoin went from $21k to $7k without fuckery. Im just asking the folk on here to be careful. Jamie Dimon has more power than the president. In my world he is a legend beyond compare in the current age. If he wants to influence bitcoin no one can do shit about it. That said he just wants in on it. This is ego driven over a bet with his daughter. Believe it or shrug it off and downvote.
