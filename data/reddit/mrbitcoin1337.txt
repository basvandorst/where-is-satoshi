You're welcome. I'm pumped. Wished I would've used it  earlier. Always was skeptical about purse.

That's what a friend of mine thought as well. What if I rename it to Bitcoin Raffle? Lul

My blockchain transactions to other addresses have been confirmed after 15 hours. My Coinbase transaction is still 0 confirmations.

My biggest turn off with Apple was due to me being over the top about them spying on everyone. Siri spelled backwards Iris. The AppStore icon is identical to the Freemason logo. Iphone = eyePhone with Iris I mean Siri. 
Now I've learned that every smart device is hackable &amp; if the government really wants to track you, no matter what device you use, they will find you, eventually. 
So I put aside my conspiracy worries and started using Apple products again as I have an iPhone SE as well. Apple does have the best phones IMO &amp; the watch is awesome, can't find a complaint yet aside from them making a watch with a SIM card slot so it functions without your phone connected (the range on the watch / phone is very nice. Other than that it's perfect. 
I always wanted a nice fitness band  &amp; for $100 more than the best fitness band out , you can grab the Apple watch and never regret it ����

It's a regular amazon box , amazon transaction , everything. To my knowledge you place an order from an Amazon list onto purse. A user on purse fulfills your reused order via whatever payment they choose from Amazon. So essentially it's an Amazon transaction on their end but they ship the item to you. Once you receive the item (my monitor was in identical Amazon packaging, you release the bitcoin from the escrow. Support is beyond helpful 24/7. Major plus as To why I will continue purchasing my stuff in purse that I don't need my Amazon prime for.

Same process as you would deal with Amazon.

They are refurbished in purse

Thank you

Yeah I am in no way trying to scam anyone as I will reveal my personal info. Well I am going to look into this more cause I'd rather not have a duel with the IRS or whatever government agency would be after me lol

Im not saying fraud doesn't occur.... fraud occurs if on every website. Doesn't mean purse.io is inherently evil because people use their service to commit fraud. I'm positive people do far worse shit with bitcoin, so we should all demonize people that use bitcoin? Do you work for CNN?

Only took 4 days from depositing my bitcoin onto purse, putting my list from amazon in, selecting my discount, within 2 hours my order was accepted. My discount increased to 33% now as well ����

Thank you. I just missed rent because of it but that's ok. I'm currently residing in a premium card board box �� 
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:27:35
Yup! Did exactly that. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:47:57
I see. Never seen it this bad ever. Thanks for the info nonetheless.

I put it this way. Everyone has backdoors &amp; the NSA can access virtually everything that isn't properly encrypted. I know from a source the FBI has access to every Facebook account. Just don't do things you will regret with any smart device not matter how protected you think you are. Don't get me wrong I'm all for privacy, i have anonymous blasted on my arm along with DPR, 9000, 1337, an onion because I like onions ����, &amp; killuminati on my sleave .. &amp; some other things. I was into rooting androids beefing up security but no technology is bulletproof. That goes for their tracking/spying technology. 
For example. 3 weeks ago at work, I work in a large warehouse repairing iPhones and laptops for an IT Company and I  leave my phone in my car. Me and one other person work in a secure cage with thousands of iPhones we refurbish. My co worker has his phone so he can communicate across warehouses. He has a note 5, the only smart device within at least 100 feet, aside from some laptops that are 10 years old. 
     Anyways, I was asking him if he played video games. He goes to say he doesn't have time but his brother plays call of duty and WWE. I then go on break to my car to check my phone. As I'm scrolling through Instagram...there's a sponsored ad for WWE. Keep in mind I have never once ever looked up WWE in a search , talked about it before that , nothing. It also popped up on my twitter. 
They are listening to everyone regardless. Smart device = government security device that they own

I am using the blockchain mobile app.. I have I never had this issue. Tried sending another transaction and still nothing. Guess I gotta wait and see. Wondering if anyone else had similar issues. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:47:20
The standard fee I've been using for the longest time now..weird

A moderated forum should be on stuff like this. They are doing with people's cryptocurrencies ... it's more valuable than gold... anyways I'm not saying it's not my fault, just don't trust anyone with that site and I highly recommend not using it. I was i want to say about the 5-6 exact same hack victim on bitcointalk. It was happening in a bunch of coins. If they are going to sit there and sensor criticism all day but not malware infected wallet qts on their official thread then why would you use it. I leaned the hard way. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:43:03
I am not justifying anything. It's reality. Purse isn't designed to launder money or stolen credit cards. Some may use it that way. Your point?
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:11:11
lol you are ignorant. Someone places an order on purse. Another user accepts that order for the discounted price you selected. They purchase the item however they choose exactly like Amazon. It's a gamble for the users earning Bitcoin on purse. For example if they accept an order for X amount of bitcoin , purchase the equivalent with fiat , the amount of bitcoin they are designated to receive may increase or decrease in value. It's a gamble for both parties. As if I would've waited 3 days I could've spent less bitcoin to get the same exact deal I posted. In this case the person whom did my transaction actually had the value of their bitcoin increase so they made money on top of what purse offers. You people do not simply understand.

Hey nice name

If it makes you feel any better I was huge into crypto trading since 2012 &amp; I got phished in 2015 for 55,000 shadowcash , at the time was equivalent to 35 bitcoin. Someone made an identical wallet qt for shadow cash that was bugged with DClogs &amp; other various Trojans. As soon as I typed in my wallet paraphrase to stake my shadowcash , boom , gone. All 55,000. Oh &amp; ive been investing since bitcoin was $27 &amp; still continue to invest. Don't give up!!!!
@_date: 2017-01-15 20:47:10
Be very careful. Trust no one. I downloaded the bugged wallet qt from the infamous bitcointalk forum. I recommend clicking no links as the bugged wallet qt was in a moderated official shadowcash forum ��
