That's why it's so damn difficult to even debate politics and policies with so many trump supporters- you have to go down to their level of analysis and and understanding, like 4th grade level. Speaking from my own experience, and I'm sure yours too, they don't even entertain other views. But what's worse I think are the smart trump supporters who somehow deluded themselves into believing in trump and his way of working.

Having both types of communities are good in my opinion. This masters student is about to spend 24/7 researching, thinking about, writing about, and disseminating all the results about blockchain tech research, all without a monetary incentive (like someone in industry might have). The average person may have spare time to do this, but it would most likely not be a 24/7 gig (unless they were a blockchain developer, but then they would be monetarily incentivized to focus on certain blockchain aspects because they need to get paid to work).
This reminds me of the geology community, where you have academics and industry people- both do research, both have pros and cons to their research, Industry has more money and many intersecting disciplines, but are more secret and less peer reviewed, academics have less money and time, can be more isolated in their overlap with other sciences, but do high quality peer reviewed studies, they disseminate all their research (because that's their monetary incentive (have to publish to get grants and get grants to publish), they teach new students, and they teach fundamentals. Over time industry and academic circles intersect at conferences and meetings, which leads to new collaborations between industry and academic institutions, which leads to more innovations and ideas. I think its a good thing.

Pope was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Nathaniel Pope, a prominent Federal judge in early Illinois Territory and a friend of lawyer Abraham Lincoln. He was the brother-in-law of Manning Force, and a distant cousin married the sister of Mary Todd Lincoln. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. He served in Florida and then helped survey the northeastern border between the United States and Canada. He fought under Zachary Taylor in the Battle of Monterrey and Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican-American War, for which he was appointed a brevet first lieutenant and captain, respectively. After the war Pope worked as a surveyor in Minnesota. In 1850 he demonstrated the navigability of the Red River. He served as the chief engineer of the Department of New Mexico from 1851 to 1853 and spent the remainder of the antebellum years surveying a route for the Pacific Railroad.

You can set automatic payments up on coinbase to do this. I think lots of people do it, I do and it's been fine, no hassel. Just send you coins to your own wallet every once in a while.

No one has mentioned yet that this drop might be related to zuck testifying about Libra in congress today. He said they wouldn't release the project to the public until it has the full backing by the government, which probably won't happen soon, so institutional investors are down on crypto in general and bitcoin in particular because it's the biggest crypto.

Yea I get what your saying too about perception of value vs. actual intrinsic value. I would argue though the the main intrinsic value of gold, in the past, was it's *use* as a currency and store of value. From the point of a historical civilization without modern technology, gold is easy to obtain en mass, can be imprinted with a seal or a mark easily, doesn't rust and disappear, is easily distinguishable from fakes, and can be physically broken into smaller increments (to an extent). And is not ugly to boot.  This is actually pretty unique in terms of metals. Silver come close but it stains easily, copper is more malleable and easier to find but rusts heavily, iron rusts heavily and isn't malleable, platinum is hard to find. Jade was used by some civilizations but in the end is a mineral and much to hard to mark easily. It also chipped and lost value. So in the end gold is chosen because it's intrinsically the best choice to store and transfer value (I would also argue that the value ascribed to jobs and material is more of the perception part, and gold was chosen to store that value).
However, nowadays the intrinsic value of gold is probably just its historical significance and perception like you said, or if it's not then it's heading that way, and we just can't let go and change. Mainly because we had no device to challenge gold with. Bitcoin is challenging gold now and I could possibly see gold being less of a store of value and more of a technological component for electronics in the future, like platinum or copper is today.
@_date: 2019-02-25 16:31:58
So does that mean bitcoin will be stable whenever reaches 100% utilization as the worlds currency. Just because global wealth will probably be more when bitcoin reaches that point in the global currency market, so using $300tn is a fine number because that's what we see now, but is there a point where bitcoin can be stable and not be 100% utilized as the worlds currency.

I own no gold but I do own bitcoin and other alts so I'm all for blockchain technology. But I'm also a geologist so in know some stuff about gold. It actually is more special than some metals in terms of currency and as a holder of value. Historically it was an easy metal to mint because it's so malleable, it's doesn't rust unlike many other metals, it was relatively easy to find, not so much anymore, it looks good to wear, it's dense enough that it could easily be distinguished from fake gold coins. In the modern day most of its utility is in electronics and historical precedent. That said I think bitcoin is a better investment.

jaxx. About 10 minutes after that unconfirmed tx another tx occurred for almost double the btc amount and was confirmed. I don't remember if I sent two separate tx's or if the first one failed and then was attempted again automatically. The second one was for more btc though which seems weird.

Yea but I wouldn't store it in coinbase for too long. It's safe enough for short term holding and for values less than $500, but for more than that it's worth finding a good wallet where you keep the keys, or a hardware wallet, then transfer coins there.
