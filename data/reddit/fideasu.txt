Well, if only we didn't still have people who don't know *what* is the Internet - for them it's just the button on the screen they use to open Facebook or whatever...
If Bitcoin ever gains general popularity, it'll be exactly the same - all this gibberish about blockchain, public ledger, nodes, mines will be exactly cryptic to them - this knowledge won't have any use for people who'll just send some Bitcoins to pay for the dinner or sth.
Also, it's the same for the fiat money that we use every day - most of people have no clue about how it works, it's just some papers (ok, nowadays mostly numbers on a screen) that they get from their employer and that they later exchange for eggs and cheese in a shop.

Linus still tightly controls the development, so if somebody'd tried to sneak in something that conflicts his vision, it probably wouldn't get merged.
SN isn't there anymore, so he can't say if an upcoming change matches his vision or not.

This. Some people find mining inefficient and quit - hashrate of the network goes down - network decreases difficulty - people who stayed in mining are making profits again.
The difficulty adjustment is a quite smart mechanism. It ensures that, no matter what, there will be a new block every (on average) 10 minutes. If more people mine - difficulty goes up to prevent blocks from popping up too often. If less people mine - difficulty goes down to prevent blocks from popping up too rarely.

They may be right, depending on what you're actually doing. If you do day trading, it's quite possible that you're actually gambling (disclaimer: there're people who know how to do it correctly, but quite a lot simply try to buy/sell every time when a spike/fall pops up - ergo, they're gambling).
If however, you just buy it and hodl, ask yourself: why do you do that? Are you planning to sell it when it goes high enough? In a long term Bitcoin was always growing, so this strategy is definitely less random. Or maybe you believe that one day Bitcoin becomes mainstream and you will simply use it as money? Then it's about ideology, not gains, so it's not gambling.

This. A lot of people trying to "debunk the myth" about the energy waste in BTC, trying to compare it with the energy usage of mainstream monetary systems somehow don't notice that all these banks and payments processors are processing *much* more txs than BTC does. It's astonishing, that the system, that uses more power than many small countries, gives us in exchange possibility to clear at most 10txs per second.
Seriously, all these claims that "it's not that much" or "it's necessary for a greater good" really don't help. This is a real problem that needs a solution, not just burying heads in the sand.

I don't get the idea here. If I understood correctly, the coin would be an equivalent of some amount of oil. Thus, theoretically, anyone owning the coin could go to Venezuela and get it exchanged for barrels somehow. But why crypto? Why can't they just emit some traditional bonds, or peg Bolivar to oil?

Note that, if the poor guy invests 5k and looses it, it's investment game over for him (assuming he's not a moron who's gonna risk his last 5k). If the rich guy invests 5k and looses it, he still has 95k, he can still risk a lot.
The poor guy should actually try to invest less in terms of percentage. But with too small capital, gains are inevitably going to be meaningless (except some extreme examples, like buying btc in 2009).

Six figures of BTC? Wow. If you've so many, you should just hire some experts to do it for you instead of asking here.
If you mean six figures when converted to USD, then just exchange it in parts - first exchange e.g. 0.5 BTC, cash out, when $ arrive, only then transfer the next 0.5 BTC to the exchange. This way, even if they lock your account or do sth nasty, your losses are limited.

Look, I don't try to claim that frontend isn't important - it obviously is, as it's the part the end user is directly interacting with. It's just not for everybody. The aforementioned problem of customers influencing the UI design in a shitty way is just one problem.
The main problem is, that it's not for everybody. Maybe you push people in it, who simply aren't good at it. In the company I was doing web dev in, there were happily enough guys much better at frontend than me, to allow me to focus on stuff I am good at.

Since transactions throughput is heavily limited, low fees will only stay as long as not many people are doing transactions. And since txs number is a function of the adoption rate, all this is actually a negative news!
That doesn't mean I want expensive transactions. But the problem of the throughput requires a real solution, not constant claims that it's no longer there. Right now, the only planned solution is LN - really hope it gets traction before the next hype.

So basically it's possible that some clueless polician invented it just to give the message "hey people, don't worry about our dying economy, we have plenty of ideas on how to save it, here's yet another one..." and put crypto in there just because the topic is big recently. You're probably right, especially in your last sentence.

Assuming an extreme scenario, where cryptocurrencies get full adoption: banks won't be "replaced". Their role may change though. There will still be a demand for e.g. credits, deposits, or some completely new services, like safe storage of your private keys.

What I wanted to say is, from taxation and avoidance PoV, cash and cryptocurrencies are pretty similar - users are pseudonymous, transactions can be done in an untraceable way, etc. Of course, evasion is much easier, but still, even in times of high popularity of cash, states were able to tax enough to fund themselves. Theoretical full adoption of crypto could bring tax authorities back to the old days - into less comfortable but definitely manageable situation.

std::vectors *do* allocate memory in a continous block. Traversing and random access are equally fast as in case of ordinary arrays. The difference is that vector's storage is always allocated on heap, while old style array can live on stack. Thus, in case you don't need to resize the container, using an array may give you better performance (but instead of old style arrays it's usually better to use std::array).

Similar to how it is/was done for paper money. It's a bit challenging, since relies mostly on honest declarations, but it's possible.
Before wire transfers and credit cards a lot of people were paid for their work directly in cash. They were spending it later on food and other commodities - and were theoretically untraceable. Evasion was easier, but in general taxation worked quite well.

Well, it should be the decision of users. If limiting choice is the way of pushing adoption, they should remove option to generate non-segwit wallets completely. I'm disappointed about that, especially since I really like the software.

It seems to be the most bullshit-free light wallet available. I was using MultiBit for a while, but when they created the newer "better" version, I decided it's a time to switch. But all other light wallets seemed to be more focused on looking "modern", "sleeky" or claiming to be "dead easy" than providing an actually simple UI without compromising essential features, like tx payment adjustment. Electrum is the only light wallet I'm aware of, where usability is more important than look - such a rarity.

Never saw any (for some reason, a few European countries completely lack them), but I always assumed it's the great way for new people to enter crypto/btc, like literally put some cash, type in the address, done.
What you describe is completely different though. If you need to go though the hassle of registration similar to an online exchange, why would anyone go though it :-/ who is the service targeted to: just to people who still get their earnings in cash? (no problem with that, but I don't see many of them around). Or maybe to older generations who never got used to electronic money transfers? (why would they want to use an electronic cryptocurrency then). Sounds pointless.
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:04:14
Well, imagine that somebody on a street claims to sell you a chocolate. But after you give him 1 € he just runs away. Wouldn't you call it a theft? Sure, maybe you're guilty too, being too naive, should've been more careful, but theft is still a theft. Even though you gave the coin the thief yourself.
Here it's the same: someone deceived him to send BTC claiming he'll be compensated in USD (implicitly: legally acquired). Sure, maybe he wasn't careful enough, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't a theft.

Ability to support my parents when they retire. Even though they always say, I don't owe them anything, I still feel obliged to help them (especially knowing how shitty their retirement money's going to be). I'll do it anyway, BTC reaching moon would simply let me give them more.
Also, I really like having some money kept aside, just-in-case, for the feeling of financial security. I don't even need to cash out, Bitcoin itself fulfills the role pretty well.
