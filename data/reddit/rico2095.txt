Have to write the 24 words down when 1st set up, I believe there is option for a 25th but not sure!?!
Then just set a pin which you enter every time you connect with USB. The app allows you to view amount you have and what its worth without  connecting everytime

Sorry for more newbie  questions, so I have encrypted the wallet, and to back it up I I save the wallet.dat file to a USB... and saved the private key for this receiving address... So I read that to keep it more private I should generate new addres to receive but once iv done this and received from exchange, what do I have to back up again? ?

Thanks for replying, so once iv set up electrum personal server and I decide to buy more bitcoin on exchange I would send it to legder via electrum wallet instead of just direct from exchange to ledger as iv been doing?

Would this not be same with people with more coins instead of hash power? Just curious
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:17:05
What would happen say if ledger or Trezor company closes down. Would i still be able to access the coins as per normal?
