Custodial wallets and off ledger transactions is my guess. With proper opsec these could prevent sizable losses. 
When processors are powerful enough lucky people could theoretically crack earlier wallets, which should reintroduce some coins. 
Also if coins becoming inaccessible becomes an urgent issue a hardfork could solve that problem. 
I don’t necessarily agree 100% with these solutions but they are possible.

Demand has stayed relatively constant, but the stream of new coins being introduced daily is causing the supply to increase while demand stays the same.
This causes the price per coin to appear to be falling when in fact the market cap is staying at around 7.9-8 billion

price drop, but it will come back up. it's good that this is happening while the currency is still young as bitcoin will bounce back quickly

I was able to make a similar purchase @ $650 per btc, so it didn't affect everyone.

It may be possible considering we'll likely see asteroid mining in our lifetimes.

Low end ~$60,000 - high end ~$120,000
Using yesterday's average of $1,200 per btc it could range from 50btc - 100btc
