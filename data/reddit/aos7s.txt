is chase retarded? they cant catagorize it as illegal gambling. all you are doing is buying rights to specific software.

how can you tax a bitcoin trade when it's unregulated? person to person trades say hello. no tax there. japan is gonna waste some time and money attempting this feat

i laughed.

no current price 655 @ 0.299 was 19$ in btc. we are being upcharged

why is there no real image of one with a rig inside of it instead of this rendered bs?

did you NOT think that using  a thai card wouldnt send up red flags? usually its thai korea china as red flags for any type of purchase.
@_date: 2014-01-08 01:10:53
Yep like uvwvj said. you are accepting BTC at it's USD value, and is subject to that. they cannot buy a$500 washer and return it expecting $600 because the method they used to convert to USD is worth more now per usd

"we will now integrate bitcoin payments with a 15% transaction fee"

i sent them all my information copies of my ID proof of bills etc and it took them over 3 months to verify my account. as of today i have never used them. they are horrible and to be honest owe me money. i was going to buy in bitcoins when i created the account @ $600/btc

make a documentary for the year, that should kick start your career and maybe some cash if you sell it for $10/dvd
@_date: 2014-04-29 04:59:33
you should screw them over by buying $0.50 in gas at a time. see how they like those card transaction fees.

Please let run escape die already
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:59:46
this is so dumb. this is just a ploy at killing bitcoin. Anyone in illegal trades already uses different things as payment over fiat currencies, which holds value when it's traded back to another illegal venue.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:35:47
wtf is gox btc? you mean gox stole everyones btc and is giving out some fake version that another exchange is for some reason holding value to?
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:33:07
what the fuck is wrong with your priorities "im broke but instead of converting $200+ of BTC into cash to go buy food, ill buy $200 in fast food"
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:06:39
yall getting goxxed by btc-e i dont see why any of you ever give these "companies 'aka 20 year old fedora neckbeards' " your money instead of getting instant cash to btc transfers and vice versa.
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:55:38
can we please have people track these bitcoins and see where they came from. lets hope this isnt the btc from mtgox...
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:41:58
how do you people store 20k$ worth of currency in a live electronic wallet... it phases me how you trust a computer to never be compromised.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:47:05
so you could technically build a new PC and get upwards of $100+ off if you buy your $100+ parts on seperate accounts. sounds like a good deal. buying HDD, monitor, case, mobo, PSU, cpu, gpu, win7(8), ram, and keyboard together nets you $200 off, easily a free cpu or gpu if you buy mid range.

why do people still use paypal? 999/1000 times you get screwed by them. transaction fees, selling fees, loading fees, Paypal CEO needs a new bentley fee....
you sell something and can prove that the recipient did receive the said item and shouldnt be charged back? denied. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:28:05
why is there so much passive aggressive "regulation this regulation that" in this posting? i rather believe this is a ploy story to attempt to get more people to accept regulation of bitcoin than what the story is really covering.
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:08:53
i highly doubt exchanges would show real time reserve amounts. im guessing a lot of them have it hidden in places or spent back into fiat etc and only convert back when buy orders come in.
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:55:02
he's not innocent. he is admitting to commiting crimes by spreading trojans. that right there gets you jail time.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:58:20
so you got $4 worth of btc ?
@_date: 2014-01-18 22:14:42
certainly didnt put too much time into your website. are you taking yourself seriously business wise? your website couldve been done in HTML in under 5 minutes using wordpad : /
@_date: 2014-02-23 17:56:17
yea... if you are inserting USD by hand you should never have to do that shit thats fucking mental. but if you are swiping a CC or debit card then you lose any anonymity in the transaction. 
the only thing this "atm" is, is a glorified computer just for signing up for a btc account... 
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:41:56
this is no different than someone scanning your card at a restaurant in someone else's machine and still telling you to pay for the meal a 2nd time.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:21:36
Its gone file in civil suite
@_date: 2014-03-21 06:49:15
yea "hey lets pocket 200,000 bitcoins and act like we have no clue who owns it, even though the owner can be tracked 100%"  
fucking gox trying to get away with 200k btc and got caught
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:57:22
Question for myself. what is a reputable website that i can do a transfer from my credit card for mBTC/BTC? mtgox hasn't verified my profile with all the required information submitted a week ago.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:34:26
god damn that pessimistic old asshole needs to shut the hell up. he's throwing out "big words" to sound right. anyone else want to beat the living shit out of this guy?
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:43:48
yea too bat mtgox is taking their fucking sweet time verifying my account. i put it in before thanks giving weekend and ifc the first bump down to 780 i looked and what do you know? NOT VERIFIED YET -_-
@_date: 2013-12-21 08:32:34
what the fuck is wrong with this country. stop fucking printing money to keep the economy going, instead stop letting huge companies rake in and pay our workers near nothing, while taxing them to high hell. Stop letting huge companies evade taxes by idiotic means. god fucking damn it as much as i hate saying it, i hope china does say fuck america and becomes the next world leading country.
@_date: 2013-12-24 10:30:19
I would've cashed out as much into BTC i could. OP is a better person than i.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:54:47
So what will the banks do when they say "oh lets just close everyones accounts since everyone is using btc"
?
