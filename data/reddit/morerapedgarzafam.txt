I remember reading about that a few weeks ago, but i think you may be responding to the wrong person with that reply.  If someone only connects to hidden services on tor, their traffic is not routed through an exit node at all.  
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:46:34
hidden services dont use exit nodes

They probably served him bad java or used social engineering to get him to reveal his true IP.  There are tons of large vendors from Silk Road and Silk Road 2 who havent been stopped by the feds.
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:32:56
His lawyers already admitted he created silk road in the opening statement right?  
How is a pgp signed message hearsay?  PGP means that only the person who had the DPR key was able to type that out.  Cirrus though the message sounded like mark karples, i dont understand where the hearsay comes in

If i wanted to send someone money, i would send it directly to a bitcoin address in the bitcoin network.  If i wanted to make a micro transaction, i would pay a decent miners fee to make sure the transaction is included in the next mined block.  Honestly, i feel most of the mirco tips are a waste of time.  Whats the point of sending someone a fraction of a penny?  If other people want to use change tip thats cool, i just can never ever see myself using it, ever.

He never attempted to hire a hitman to kill libertas or plural of mongoose , his closest business partner(s).
I think you are talking about the moderator chronic pain/ flush who stole hundreds of thousands of bitcoins from the site.  You must be referencing when the government used entrapment to try and tack on more serious charges.
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:19:24
Tip the fucking bitcoin address he listed you retard, no one wants to use a centralized service when they dont have to.  Changetip is retarded.

I can tell you have been brainwashed by government propaganda. I dont trust the accusations of a government that has been proven to lie, use tactics like parallel construction, illegally spy on citizens, ect.  You already agreed the government is dishonest and corrupt, now you want to sing their praises?  
I dont believe Ulbright has been given a fair trial.

I dont pay taxes, but i vote :)
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:09:47
I made well over 100K last year and the only taxes i paid were exerciser tax.  I have paid no state or federal income tax for the last 10 years for that matter.  The IRS cant do shit, they dont have the money to catch even a small percentage of tax cheats.  Agorism is legit, join me.
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:55:44
Im paid in cash and I don't report it.  No one reports it, i don't have a W2 or any legitimate income.  I just don't file any taxes at all, my money is in gold, land, and bitcoin.
Its been 10 years and the IRS hasn't even sent me a nasty letter in the mail or anything.  
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:56:42
you alreday said that, and my response was, 
insightful and well thought out response, great counterpoints.
i can tell you are proud to be American, enjoy worshiping the state with your worthless life
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:07:37
Yes, hopefully they wont include the pro drug war bias you and other ignorant commenter's have shown.
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:42:50
I cant wait to send them letters in jail

today i learned you can be a murder without killing anyone or anyone even dying for that matter.  
Stupidity like this is why you work in retail.
@_date: 2015-03-29 18:01:18
Im doing a ton of crime with bitcoin every single day, so you can call the local police and report me and see what happens.  
Im not here to get rich of bitcoin going to the moon, im here to use bitcoin to increase personal freedom and undermine the government.

DPR did more for bitcoin than you ever will. He also gave people more personal freedom.  The man is a legend, lets not just forget about him.   
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:58:54
Nice ad hominem attack, trying to discredit what he has to say because you deem him to be an "adict" based on post history.  
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:17:02
what is it with you people and the ad hominem attacks.  Call me stupid, an addict, brainwashed, whatever.  Its all attacking my character and skirting around the topic of discussion.  Is it so hard to comprehend that not everyone is going to agree with you?
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:04:21
Bitcoin is great, you dont even need a reddit login to use it.  Why provide more info than is needed to complete transactions?  
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:40:19
Myself and others told everyone paycoin was a scam way before the miami bitcoin conference.  This cunt took the free trip to miami and money, when she knew full well what was going on.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:41:40
Yes, because knowing the exact age of ross is paramount to having an opinion on DNM's.  Are you serious or are you just trolling?
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:02:58
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:57:23
Thanks, i appreciate the sentiment.  Im not going to collect it though.  I already have tons of bitcoins, i got in early.  Ill leave it so you can get it back and introduce someone new or something.  Thats the one positive i can see, tipping new users to inform them about bitcoin.
And i just want to add on, its important to make sure you know to tumble, know about reusing addresses, and to use tor if you are going to be using bitcoin.  I don't think its wise to "outsource" your security practices to a third party.
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:04:12
That is flat out incorrect.  Ulbright is a revolutionary human being that has increased my quality of life substantially and undermined oppressive laws.
Ok, hows this, In criminal law, entrapment is a practice whereby a law enforcement agent induces a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would have otherwise been unlikely to commit.
Was ross likely to order the hit had the government not commandeered Chronic pain's account, or was the hit allegedly ordered ONLY because the government &amp; CP/Flush had stolen from DPR? 
Now a task for you, Look up the definition of parallel construction.
The US government is a bad, bad, organization.

Your personal wallets dont have a request payment function with a QR code that can be pulled up.  Many vendors are using their personal wallet for sales, probably beacuse you dont even have an ipad app for vendors.
the website was  is that you guys or am i just confused and using someone else?
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:09:59
how do you use coinbase if you are unbanked?
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:39:31
There was no option for the merchant to enable, becuase you dont even have an ipad app for merchants to use.  Im talking about the request payment function, if you think there is a QR code there you are wrong.
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:29:11
they go on and on and on
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:05:15
There is so much stupid in this comment it hurts my brain to read it.
Why are you implying that DNM operators have a duty to donate profits?  Look if you are about regulation, bitcoin may not be for you.  How about you go get a FDIC insured bank account and keep your money there.  Celebrate regulation and prohibition somewhere else.  Were about freedom in this sub, not worshiping the state and celebrating their rules.
and FYI the court documents (spread sheets from DPR) show he donated thousands of dollars every month to tor servers, but dont let the facts get in the way of your preconceived notions.
