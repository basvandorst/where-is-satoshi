BCash is trash and its holders are dumb.
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:30:20
Because it is a currency and doing that increases its value????
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:01:09
Why is it that cryptocurrencies are losing their value?
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:19:15
So many bots and normies commenting here, ewww.

Well, yeah, anyway, I'm masochist, so it's a win whether I get profits or not.

BCash only exists and maintains itself because of its name similarity.
