Run your own node? Nodes don't mine your bitcoin. Hash power mines your bitcoin. What the actual f*** does having your own node supposed to do for you?

$0.25 to buy a beer. Worth it

I definitely like the Satoshi symbol better. It hits closer to home. Its more about what Nakamoto has done and less about the specific existence of the blockchain

I can't wait for the masses to adopt this super easy to use, simple method. We're a game changer. Credit cards watch out

How do you detect RBF? Let's say I'm a walmart cashier. How tf do i know if someone is using the RBF op code or not?

Yeah, i don't think a normal person is going to know how to safely and securely set up a Lightning node. I think people are going to rely on third parties, middlemen, custodial wallets, etc...
This was certainly not the decentralized path to adoption.

Oh really? How?

1) What wallet shows you the red-yellow-no label?
2) 0-conf is always safe with small transactions. Paying a third party to spin up a ton of nodes and cause a double spend is not only expensive, but risky for the criminal wanting to do it.  How can a criminal trust a criminal with a criminal act over the internet? Its perfectly safe for small transactions. And its perfectly valid to say you can just call the police if for some reason it fails.
3) Lightning is NOT safe. If your node is not kept running constantly, you could lose your funds forever, and not even your seed will save you. And you can't control others actions, so you can't force them to keep theirs running. You're far more likely to lose money messing around with a lightning network then using a reliable, not-broken 0-conf.

How as a merchant would you know that?

I see so many people looking at historical prices. I'm starting to get concerned that its not going to do anything like anyone is expecting. History doesn't necessarily repeat, sometimes paradigms evolve.
Anyways,  and let's not let anything stop us
