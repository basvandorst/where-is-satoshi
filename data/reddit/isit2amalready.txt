Exactly, but what would this look like while still not requiring centralization? Wallet addresses are essentially public keys made out of thin air and algorithmically secures your coins to the blockchain.  This way no central system needs to generate and manage it for you. 
Newer Cryptocurrencies improve the user experience by allowing you to generate unique usernames/wallet addresses but are essentially partially centralized on 21 “block chain producers” that can get voted out. And this still doesn’t mean you can’t fake an address. 
Cryptocurrencies solve our problem of not having to trust a central authority but it’s yet to solve the problem of truly trusting each other. It’s going to require way more complex algorithms. In the meantime BTC is as good (/better) than cash with less drawbacks.

Not really. If he bought the pizza with a credit card and they didn't give him a pizza and kicked him out, he could open up a dispute with his credit card company. Amex in particular is notorious for siding with the card holder. So no, it doesn't go for "any transaction" if you really think about it. Though I am 100% in support of BTC. It's more a regular cash sale.

Yes but you are forgetting that crypto wallets are pseudo-anonymous and aren't verified by any authority to their owners. In this example the store owner can just tell the authorities that this gentleman scammed him by sending payment from one of his BTC address to another that the scammer owned—trying to fool the owner. (Nevermind that most cops couldn't even grasp any of this.)
Again, just playing devils advocate.
