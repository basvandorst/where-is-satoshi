Well, IBM, Texas Instruments, Samsung etc all contributed to the Linux kernel. That doesn't mean the kernel isn't open source.
It isn't rare for companies to contribute to open technologies.

Almost all financial crashes have been as consequences of normal investor behavior. A crash is normally a consequence of investor sell-offs, a sudden decrease in demand, which is textbook normal investor behavior.

Bitcoin confirmed at $35000 in 2020. Funding secured.

I was almost murdered here for saying that a year ago. And apparently I was an idiot for calling Bitcoin volatile at the time.

what is the danger to this?

You just described the definition of a bubble. Everyone gets onboard hoping to get rich and nobody cares about intrinsic value. Nobody cares about that one guy who actually wants it to stabilize and be useful in everyday life.

That wasn't the question. OP asked why Bitcoin has a high volatility. The volatility of Bitcoin is enormous compared to most currencies.

Investors will always act like that, regardless of asset.

But six months ago everyone here told me it wasn't a bubble.

Transactions per day is steadily decreasing. I think the price will drop further.

Man, I really want this craziness to end soon and stabilize. Bitcoin will never be a universally accepted payment method unless volatility drops.

I could put my blog in a chart together with Facebook, Instagram and Google to show "potential".
The history and success of the lightbulb, Internet and airplanes have nothing to do with Bitcoin. It might just as well end up like Betamax, but of course that one isn't included in the chart, because it doesn't fit the narrative.
