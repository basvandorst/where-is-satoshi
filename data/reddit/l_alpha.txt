I am valuing what you are saying. I will think about it now and hope to hear from you in the future.

Because a banking job means you work always. I dont see a way to do both when one option is keeping my busy 24/7.

I am very grateful for your insight!
There is one thing I am still trying to get my head around. In my case working in ITB and having a Bitcoin business is like being an internal competition. My future boss is clever and very intelligent. If he ever finds out that I would work on a company that is direct competition to his business, I dont know how he will react.
Its a huge dilemma for me. The choice between what I could do and what I should do.

I am thinking of beginning with a simple website that offers news updates and consulting to people and businesses that want to engage into Bitcoin. In the long term I would love to establish an exchange in my country and offer a way for Bitcoin to become existent here.

Better avoid MtGox, too much risk. I personally love kraken because they have the lowest fees i know of.

Its really strange. The books are so thin, if I am selling 10 coins I am moving the whole market there. In my opinion its the best exchange out there, which is savely harbored in the UK and offers the most sophistiated trading methods but you almost never see a limit order above 1 BTC. 
I do not understand at all.

go into more detail please about what you think what kind of business could do that.
I mean I know people with a lot more free time who would work with me. That could actually work.

I think you could use 50% of your fiat and buy into BTC. 
What do you think?

The good thing about it is that its slow. Whenever news arrive at r/Bitcoin and the other exchanges it takes kraken some time until kraken reacts to it. But the thin order book doesnt let you profit at all. They have the lowest trading fees of all exchanges, I dont understand why there are not more people trading there.

Yeah I use a new account but I know about Reddit and r/Bitcoin. But I will still get some good intel from commited people I think.

To be honest, I dont find working in an international company too interesting. In reality you are just a bureaucrat in a treadmill. They all have great reputations and offer you funny trainings and things to learn but I intern at a similar company at the moment and I know what the 30+ people think about such companies. Nobody here is commited and everyone is happy to be home at 5:30 and watch TV. Thats not what I am looking for.

The fees at kraken are the lowest that I know of. The only 'free' way is using websites that give you little amounts of Bitcoin in order to do simple tasks. But its just not worthwile, I think. Better work a part time job and put this money into Bitcoin directly at the lowest possible fees.
