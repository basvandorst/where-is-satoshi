My ex boss told me about it. We were vaguely planning to build a tote betting product based on BTC (I was working in the horse racing industry so we were well placed to do so).
Other priorities (like "I want this text on the homepage now!") got in the way so it never went any further, but I was sold on the technology.

Some newspaper that I can't remember the name of wrote a story that 'outed' some random guy as being the creator of bitcoin including showing pics of his house and car license plate. That man is Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. After it was pretty conclusively shown to be the case that he was not *that* Satoshi, the bitcoin community decided to raise funds for the guy as a sort of apology on behalf of those who had make untrue claims about him. It just seems like the right thing to do when this guy's life got flipped turned upside down and I'd like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell you how he became the prince of a town called bit air.

Sadly I think it's extremely likely that some people have harassed her in quite inappropriate and disappointing ways. 
The inevitability of this kind of backlash is shameful and I am glad that - while quite correctly critical of her piece on Dorian - didn't devolve into a witch hunt. There were a few calls to "publish photos of *her* house and see how she likes it" that I saw, but they were all downvoted and discouraged, which is great.

I thought your question was asking what the == meant, I was trying to explain in a succinct way to someone who I (incorrectly) assumed had no knowledge of programming. That was bound to miss the nuances but I hoped to convey the general idea.
I'd argue that it does mean "y is the same as x". Not in the sense of an assertion, but in the sense of translating code to natural-language.
For example, if we extend the code to include it in an if, which of these is more correct?
"If test for the equality of x being equal to y"
"If y is the same as x"
edit: Likewise "while y is the same as x" or a whole bunch of other common patterns.
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:18:30
Well yes, that's true. But C-based syntax is the de facto standard for pseudo code.
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:59:41
In programming = is an assignment, == is a comparison.
Think of the left side as a bucket and the right side as the possible contents.
`x = y` means "put y into x"
`x == y` means "y is the same as x"
So roughly, OP is saying "elapsed time is the same as increased trust".
Don't get me started on ===

Well, you seem confused and determined to agitate.
You argue that my currency is the world standard, but then point out that GBP isn't world standard. What is your point here? That I should have paid in GBP instead of supporting the bitcoin economy? So you expect the fledgling bitcoin economy to be competitive with established businesses? That seems unrealistic.
I am willing to pay a modest premium in exchange for the advantage of paying in bitcoin. Allow me to list only those advantages which first spring to mind and are immediately applicable to this situation:
1) It's magic internet money so in many ways this coin was free. Or if you don't like that phrasing, let's say it was paid for entirely out of my investment profits.
2) By purchasing, I am supporting one guy who was brave enough to set up a business based on bitcoin, and by proxy I am supporting the entire currency.

Well, thanks for taking the effort to go through some of the errors, but I would call most of your points nitpicks rather than glaring errors. They are communicating verbally so I forgive them for getting some facts and figures mixed up. I don't think it damages the points they were making too much. I think you're taking their words far too literally. Like I don't think the guy was *actually* talking about hiding bitcoins from your mom,  just wanted to make the point that people were selling to disassociate themselves from what they feared was perceived as something dirty. Poor analogies are often conjured up in a realtime conversation.
I think a lot of what the host said was designed to provoke conversation. Like "hopefully he realizes that fiat currencies are also virtual", well I'm sure he does; he even prefaced that with "let me play devils advocate".

Only con I can see is that the long term plan for bitcoin is sort of an all or nothing game. What I mean by that is that you either have to convert your coin into USD straight away (coindesk, bitpay), or face the fact that when you sold your doodah yesterday, you recieved $100 worth of bitcoin for it, but today it's only worth $80. Of course tomorrow it might be worth $120! But can you endure that kind of variability? In the long term (assuming all goes to plan), thinking of bitcoin in terms of USD value is going to be as alien as saying that it's not worth as much Thai Baht as it was yesterday. But in the medium term, everyone you do business with is still working in dollars.

Uh, shouldn't y'all be tipping as well?
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:29:04
well, I'm just being honest. This isn't an advert!
The service, a discount, and the fact you can pay in bitcoin was good enough for me.
If you want to pay in some outdated currency to save a few units of that currency, then you're welcome to ;)

Thanks :) Something about becoming a father has made me very concerned with legacy. Little'un's going to have so much shit passed down to him he'll need a storage unit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:37:11
wow, bitcoin's finally hitting the mainstream.

When did you get that reply?
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:22:21
How can I best set this up?
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:40:20
anything else would be crazy.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:22:11
Yeah, let's distribute the profits from drug deal facilitation among the people. That sets a great precedent, right?

Start a BBQ business, accept bitcoin as payment through bitpay.com, post about it here. I guarantee you'll get sales.
Yes, there's a million BBQ joints out there already. But do they accept bitcoin? At the moment just about anyone can start a business accepting bitcoin and have a ready-made market to sell to. I've bought kebabs from a company I never would have tried before, but they accept bitcoin so they got my business. I bought a silver coin today for *more* than the competitor, because they accept bitcoin.
Do it.

I would spend most of it on making bitcoin more accessible. Wallet software with a simple UI, explanatory websites, maybe a bitcoin for dummies book.
Bitcoin is still largely unfriendly and geeky. That needs to change.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:50:56
Yep! That was why I posted it, saw the similarity (albeit with a big difference and time and magnitude)
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:48:04
What's the difference between a dollar and bitcoin?
One empowers the people and symbolizes liberty, the other is a dollar.

I was listening to that just now!

You're a class act.
This is the first tip I have ever given too, and being British I was glad to find something appropriate to tip with.

The juxtaposition of the headline and Eat out from £5 genuinely surprised me. What a society we live in.

I never even saw anything like $250 when I was 14. If they had access to that kind of money, I'm guessing the kid won't be heartbroken if (s)he loses the initial investment.
I agree with your comment addressed to "bitcoin people" though.

Yes, I can't think of any government that has patently absurd laws on their books. It just doesn't happen.

Most other assets will go back to the economy by default after a certain period. Eg if I lease a storage container, fill it with gold, pay up front for 100 years of lease and then burn all documentation about it, never mention it and then I die, in 100 years the owners of the container are going to open it up and seize the gold, returning it to circulation.
Eventually those assets become available to the rest of the economy again.
That is literally impossible with BTC.
I suppose all it does is increase the scarcity/value of BTC in the long run.

It's not very effective.

It's a 1oz silver Britannia with the year of his birth on it.
Obviously not buying it as an investment for him, just as something for him to keep.
Just wanted to share that and say thanks to Jed at [gold4bitcoins.co.uk]( for helping me out. His prices are not very competitive, but it's the only place I know of in the UK you can use bitcoins to buy silver and gold, and he sorted out a very nice discount for me.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:32:44
Yeah it's cool stuff. I found it on  which I recommend if you don't know it already.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:00:45
Wow that sounds dodgy as fuck. Literally just laundering.

Having a convo on facebook and someone else suggested that mt. Gox was essentially a single point of failure.
Still don't understand why mt. Gox going down affected the price though.

I was going to mention that too.
edit: on the plus side, they are using webfonts and JS not an animated gif for that.
