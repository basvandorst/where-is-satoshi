This whole economy is a farce. This video eloquently sums up my thoughts exactly. Rent seeking banking cartel. They create nothing of value. They prey on others to remain in existence.
I liquidated my entire stock portfolio this week. I'm now building a short position in XLF (financial ETF) , accumulating GLD, and holding a little bitcoin and physical cash. Thats it. Oh, and a few years worth stockpile of my favorite alcoholic beverages ;). I'm sticking with this plan and adding weekly to my positions until retirement.

You are correct I was referring to the etf. However the GLD holds actual physical gold.

Only some coins and jewelry at the moment. If the paper price starts to decouple drastically from physical, I would convert some GLD to bars. GLD does hold the physical so it shouldn't be a problem. Plus its more convenient right now for me to buy GLD every week going forward than having to order physical. What are some reliable sources for physical?

Ummm do you mean SWC? You call that poker? I mean to force the really awful stuff away from bitcoin. I know it exists.

If it were easier to open a bank this wouldn't be a problem.

This is good non-news story. I think the market needed a little shake out and this gets more clarity on China's position (one which is benign to me). I was surprised we didn't crack 1250 after Ron Paul comments. This news might be the trigger for marching higher. Prediction&gt; new highs coming.

China love the Bitcoin.

This is going to confuse people, no? At least it might crush the alt coins. so maybe a little confusion at first could benefit long term.

Next up organizing class action lawsuits. Bitcoin needs to lawyer up!

Noob here. 
Re: paper wallets. Doesn't bitaddress see your private key when you print it or generate the wallet? So would I print the paper wallet and send bitcoin to it? That's it?
How do you password protect the paper wallet? Can i create backups of the paper wallet somehow just in case?
Re: offline storage. If I have an offline computer, do I create a wallet on it through multibit, then send bitcoin to that new offline wallet on the computer that never connects to the internet? Would that be considered safe cold storage?
