I din't get it, how someone can use your bitcoin address?
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:54:08
Not really

@_date: 2017-02-08 19:48:25
So you can't see your money? What wallet are you using?
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:42:11
Obviously it depends on your country or state.
@_date: 2017-02-18 23:18:02
Ohhh, is it only 6k nodes? I thought it should be much more
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:22:04
I don't think it's possible to generate "free" bitcoins and "invalid blocks" that other 49% miners will accept, because of bitcoin protocol
@_date: 2017-02-08 14:40:51
Link is broken
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:36:03
me too, thanks

If everyone increase transaction fee we'll have the same stuck problem. It's look like chase between bitcoin users.
@_date: 2017-02-22 22:48:29
So you have the account just to post about unconfirmed tx?
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:41:25
No, it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:53:11
Unconfirmed transaction for more than 5 days is a real bug.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:39:04
It's nice that devs able to fix it before the fork
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:24:42
Wow, it's good time to buy some BU.
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:24:19
This is gon' be freaking hardfork 
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:19:21
Yes, but it is possible to have BTCU and BTCC at the same time.

Average monthly salary in my region is about $200 and you're saying that these fees are cheap and worth it.
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:26:18
@_date: 2017-01-23 07:31:48
I used  several times
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:06:10
How to get money for free with little effort? 
@_date: 2017-01-24 10:19:18
Why do you happy about it? If people stop using bitcoin it will be worthless
@_date: 2017-01-29 22:06:01
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:13:26
Is it possible to track someone's addresses if you know public key?
@_date: 2017-01-31 22:08:57
Had the same for about hour ago
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:26:37
Your receiving address cannot expire, hope you'll see transaction after confirmations.
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:57:11
Invest in real estate is bright idea, if you believe in bitcoin you can always buy more and just wait for a couple of years
