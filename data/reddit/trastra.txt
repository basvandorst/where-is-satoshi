Hello! It was also a good attempt on your part.
We are surprised how quickly you could go through the registration and verification of your account within an hour on the TRASTRA.COM :)
We understand that you advertise your Bitwage service in this way, even if this is due to the fact that you compare our TRASTRA service to the negative side. What you wrote does not correspond to reality.
If you really want to enjoy the magic of our service, we recommend that you REALLY register an account, after that, you may cashout crypto or use our crypto-magic transfer every day. ! All the more so by the referral code, your transaction fees will be 0% ! 
Have a great day =)

Oh, thank you for noticing that, it is kind of misleading from our side.
Our card won't be automatically linked to PayPal. TRASTRA will provide customers with an opportunity to link the card to PayPal. It is just an extra-solution.

Hi there, Bitcoin-Yoda)
Thank you for your comment. We got your idea, you are right. However, there is a large number of crypto users who would like to cash out their btc by bank transfers (or smth like that).
We just provide customers with the solution of using International Banking Account Number in order to make such transfers.

Thanks for your contribution :)

Yes, correct :) For more information you can visit our FAQ, there you'll find a full explanation.
Aha, yes, you are definitely right, someone can suppose that we are noobs here:) We do not assume it as FAQ promotion, just a way to find out what do crypto users think about our solutions, cause we are on the stage of pre-launch and it really matters to us.
Thank you for your comment!

just FYI :)

You are definitely right. Thanx. We do not suggest our customers throw their BTC. 
IBAN account can also be used to top up Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet and buy cryptocurrency. It becomes just a medium to manage cryptocurrency.
Few months after our launch we are going to provide users not only with IBAN accounts but also with a bitcoin card (it is like a coming-soon option) and other features.
