Your channels are separate from each other. Don’t think in terms of your total balance, but in terms of your balance in a channel.
Say I have a 0.1 btc channel with A, and a 0.1 btc channel with B, and somebody routes money trough me (by first routing trough A). Then my balance with A is +0.1btc, and with B -0.1btc. So the total balance is still the same (0), but I can’t route the same transaction again (since the channels would become +0.2btc and -0.2btc, which they are too small for).
I got this from the lightning spec on the bitcoin core website

But how can the old nodes see the transactions as valid if they don’t include any witness data? Or do they just see jiberisch for those defekt transactions?
And what about the block hash ? The old node has to verify that the previous blockhash is correct, but it can’t calculate it ?

You can not just send 10 times a 0.1 bitcoin transaction trough a 0.1 channel. The channel gets ‘used up’. Somebody would have to transact the opposite way trough it to charge it up again for you.
E.g A -&gt; B channel of 0.1 btc. Your transaction pushes all of this to B. Now you need to wait for someone to push it from B to A to transact again

How would that technically work? 
You have a channel open with one person and can only update the state there (and release the revoke keys of the previous state). 
Actually you can spend all the money in a channel, and then someone else can route it the other way, and you can spend it again (because on a different channel owed by you, this amount will be compensated)
You are saying that with 0.01 btc channels you can still send an arbitrary amount of money (having to send multiple transactions is a non issue, the software will do it for you).
Here is a good page to start reading: 
EDIT: it’s part 2 of the article that specifically deals with this issue

But then miners can just put fake balances, no? You don't need 51% for that. With 1% you get more then a block or day already. And you just need to catch 1 block to cheat

Yeah, that Belgian site where you can buy bitcoins does it that way if you don't provide a public key

They just need to get the block published. Going trough a proxy for that is almost no work. 
I don't see how you can blacklist them except by just using a whitelist system, which goes against everything Bitcoin is

Or the old fork one will be the altcoin. It's just convention

But "the amount of transactions in a node men-pool" can be gamed. And later it becomes impossible to check the validity unless you somehow store the amounts. And how can you even do that? Some sort of consensus between nodes? That invalidates the POW mechanism if you just have some offchain data that influences if a chain is valid.
@_date: 2015-06-21 11:57:15
I disagree, Bitcoin is a terrible place to store value. It's incredibly volatile and the cost to bring it down is way cheaper that to bring down something like gold or the dollar.
And I buy stuff all the time with bitcoins. For example this week I've bought 2 pizzas (€12 worth), put credit on my phone (€15 worth) and bought a game for steam ($10 worth). All on-chain transactions.
I agree that Bitcoin doesn't scale good, but I don't think Bitcoin will ever handle a significant portion of global traffic. 20mb blocks will probably be plenty and can sustain a pretty large Bitcoin market while allowing transaction to happen on chain ($100 billion + market cap).

The blocks. But I read some post further where you had the idea to have nodes relay empty blocks slower/not at all, which could work.
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:38:15
It isn't invalidated. It just a chance game, what you did in the past is irrelevant. (You could say that you already tried some numbers, but there are so many more correct possibilities that this is completely negligible)

That's probably the smartest thing. Trying to outplay the IRS is generally not a good idea. Either it's not about much money and not worth the risk, or it's about a lot of money and then you're really screwed.

I trust certain third parties way more then myself.
I trust the bank to not lose my money more, then I trust myself to not lose it (which happens way too often, but that's beside the point).

There are more then enough nodes.
Planning to run a node if too little nodes become a problem is just as beneficial as running one now.

Say I have a dollar and lend it to you in exchange for two. You use the dollar to pay me back half your debt. 
Then you fix my car and I pay you a dollar for the service (the one you payed back half your debt with). Then you pay back the remaining dollar you still owe me, using the dollar you just earned.

They used money that is government-backed and meant to be used for an education, for their personal greed.
I consider this stealing from society.
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:12:12
It seems to me, its pretty hard for the government to justify such drastic measures against bit coins. Is their a precedent where the government tries to shut down something that is not really illegal but can be used for illegal things? Like with piracy they don't try to shut down the p2p torrent system, but the sites giving you the illegal torrents.

What do you find 'legitimate' things to spend money on?
Luxury cars are not just to show off money. 
Especially a car like this, it's actually decently priced for what you get. It's smoother and more pleasant to drive in and you pay maybe 30k extra for the premium.
Donating money to non-profits is way more about image and vanity then this. You get literally no return out of it except the image and admiration of people (and tax breaks).

Everything has risks. Even USD or EUR currency. There is stuff you can invest in that can be argued to have similar risk as those 2.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:48:54
Yes, which means you can't say yen and dollars are 'for all intents and purposes' the same currency.
@_date: 2013-07-26 14:56:03
I get your reasoning. And I agree it's 'true' when you use certain definitions of 'responsibility' and 'consent'.
I disagree with it tough. In my 'moral code' inaction doesn't have the same strength as action. I don't think not saving someone is equally wrong as killing someone (I don't think it's wrong at all in almost all situations).
I don't consent with some (most/all) things the governement is doing. Condoning isn't the same as consenting and I take no responsibility for their actions. Only in extreme cases condoning is equal to consenting (like when someone is stealing in your benefit and you know you can end it with just one word, but you don't because you want it to continue).

Regardless if bitcoins will keep existing, you don't think phrases like 'Bitcoin is supposed to take over world curency, and if it does, exchange charts and the exchanges themselves will be history.' are a little crazy.
Different currencies have existed side-by-side for centuries. Do you really think that bitcoins are so amazing that they will choke all competition?
If you do, 'delusional' is the perfect word to describe you.

You're right they are pretty similar, with spideroak having the advantage of encryption.
I personally use dropbox because I have a lot of shared maps there (some with a couple 100 of people so hard to get everyone to change) and because I've got 22 gigabite of free storage for 2 years (there was a 'space race' recently where if you went to a big college you got 20 gigs extra for 2 years). And lastly I've already got dropbox installed on my computers and phone and I don't see any benefit in switching over.

I thought the amount of coins that are added is predeterminned. And more mining power equals the same amount of coins (each coin just needs more power, the total amount of coins generated is the same)
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:37:05


Those exchange rates change all the time. By printing more USD's you are not directly influencing the 'value' of any currency but USD. A major incident in for example Japan, doesn't influence the USD the same way as the yen.
This is quite a difference from having one currency. Stuff like the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe wouldn't happen.
