Their office is 30 minutes from my house. Sending and receiving JPY is easy and fast.

I guess they (the Japanese) think it is risky to send money abroad and too many questions asked at banks as to why transferring large amounts. Last year a new law came in to effect for overseas remittances, banks can demand ID, proof of employment, proof of salary etc. Anyone sending over $50k will be checked out by the banks and a report filed to the AML division of the JP government.

You won't be able to get $$$ out of MtGox if you are in JP, only Yen. So cash out in Yen and not USD. And plan ahead if you can, because there are not so many Yen trades compared to USD trades.

Wasn't Karpeles supposed to have 100k+ BTCs personally?
I wonder if Premium status accounts get paid first or can move their BTCs out?

I am in Tokyo and buy/sell at MtGox, because it is easy and fast. JPY cash deposits in less than 3 hours, JPY withdrawals the same day. If I ever have a big problem, then they are just 30 minutes from me. Only negative is cashing out in JPY, because there are not so many trades in JPY compared to USD; unless you want to take a hit. My withdrawal limits are JPY 50,000,000 per month, that's about USD 500,000.

Yes , you can transfer by furikomi in Japan. I have done this several times. It takes around 4 hours for the funds to be credited to your Mt.Gox account.

I got one of those after I logged-in on Saturday. Nice to have confirmation about it, but they got my time stamp wrong by minus 12 hours and a few minutes. I won't say what I'm thinking....

Two problems doing that: 1. You were verified as residing in JP, Gox only pays out in the country which you reside in. So by moving to the US you will have to be verified again. But my feeling is you might have to cash out in JP and start again in the US. 2. Payments to the US take forever. Also if you move your BTCs from Gox to an US exchange you could lose when cashing out as the price differential between Gox and others is around 14-18%. You can check various exchanges here:   Quite often on Gox the JPY price vs. the USD price do not track the currency exchange rates. So you can gain a slight amount by buying or selling in the currency which has the better "Gox" rate.

 If you go to the Mt.Gox office you will find more French staff than Japanese.

I now have "Premium Status" on MtGox, which means withdrawals of up to USD500K per month, daily USD100k. So I receive the usual email saying my account status has been upgraded and what limits do I wish to set. I reply, USD100,000 daily, USD500,000 monthly, 10,000 BTCs daily. So what do I find? They set my limits to 10 BTCs daily, USD10 daily and USD500 monthly! It has been 6 days since my email to them and still no correction or reply. I have a lot sitting there and need to move it. This is their fault and I'm paying for it.
Update: They now have corrected their mistakes. FYI, it took 1 week after I complained about it.
