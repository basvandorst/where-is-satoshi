I would say 10-20% for alt coins in case one of them explodes in value. I bought some iota the other day. It's ona totally different framework than bitcoins since it doesn't use the blockchain, but rather a more efficient, but not extensively tested, network called Tangle. It's currently at $4. I don't think it can ever be as great as bitcoins but could reach $500 one day maybe if all goes well.

My guess is that they check public records, which could mean a soft credit history inquiry. Do you have credit history? If no, that could be the reason.

I started with Coinbase but got tired of their high fees. Now use Gemini. They allow you to wire unlimited amounts of money from your bank into your Gemini account. Fees are lower, and even the price itself is sometimes lower.  They don't have litecoin though.

I estimated the price to be $250K eventually. This is based on the assumption that people will become indifferent between gold and bitcoins.

Gemini allows you to spend $500 immediately and charges your account later. Your bank should be one of the famous one though (Chase, Wells Fargo, ...)

There should be a bitcoin/cash escrow service.

If the market believed that the price is supposed to fall sharply on Sunday, everyone would want to sell before that, so it's gonna be cheap by the time you wanna sell it. So you would want to sell on Saturday instead. But everyone else thinks the same so the price would already be low on Saturday. So you decide to sell on Friday, but everyone else think the same so the price would be low on Friday. The point is, if the market thought that futures trading would cause the price to fall, you would see the effect already.

Still didn't break into the 20s
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:59:06
It seems like a lot of people are selling but demand is strong enough (probably because of new entrants) to keep the price from falling.

sell a kidney. buy it back when you get rich.

So assuming most people have multiple wallets and many of the wallets are empty, the actual number of people owning bitcoins currently is a fraction of 22 million?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:31:56
same here. you can just wait.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:46:23
For me, it took them about 3 days to withdraw the money, and about 10 days to add my purchase to my wallet.

The question is if it will ever get to $18K today or tomorrow. It's like it always stops right before doing so.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:54:32
I did the same. I only experienced with a small portion and as soon as the price started to rise, I lost all the gains I'd made before. Once again, I learned that one cannot outsmart the market.

Is there a prize for the closest forecast?

Why didn't you buy from amazon?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:16:24
You're right. The problem s you never know when the rising would start.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:35:05
Exit but don't come here crying when it gets to $100K.

CME starts on the 18th.

Don't know really. I would read the function of several altcoins and see which ones look interesting to me. It's very much like a gamble.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:35:37
I didn't mean that gold is a bad investment/store of value. I just meant that investing in it wouldn't be my priority because it kinda looks old school.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:35:35
It's either because they're gaining interest on the money before it shows on our accounts, or they want us to use credit card instead (for instant transactions) and pay higher fees.

Don't donate. These crappy organizations waste 90% for their own expenses and help the needy with maybe 10% of the funds.

I think it's an intergenerational transfer of wealth because most people who used to have high holdings of bitcoin used to be teenagers or college students. Most senior people are still hesitant about the whole thing.

This is how wallstreet has made money for a long time.

No, I mean when all the dust settles. Could be in 2 years or 10 years.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:14:55
These problems can be fixed. No other coin is a household name as bitcoin is. So once its problems are fixed it will be back on track to 100K.

I have a PhD in economics. Let me tell you why most academics hate bitcoin:
- they don't know what it is exactly. They haven't traded even one satoshi in their life. They just read in the news that the price is rising every day and assume it's a bubble.
- they can't fathom that 16 year olds with no formal education in finance and economics have made more money than they will ever do.

If most people who can afford to invest are already in, then I have a clue. But I hope I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:50:07
I really hope this is the case.
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:38:13
I think my assumptions are reasonable. What's your guess on the type of people who invested in the last bullrun?
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:56:19
Nice job. [Popcoyn]( provides this info as well.
