I messaged a few friends about upvoting my 10 challenges however i dont think they never got around to doing it or aren't interested (don't think many 40 year olds can be stuffed to sign up for Reddit).  However I have a close workmate who  is extremely interested in Bitcoins. He  babbles on about Bitcoins  and has  worn a few Bitcoin T shirts to work. i managed to talk to him and get him interested in your challenges!. He  got a reddit account like yesterday or something and he said he would defenitely make a bitcoin logo shaped pizza and upload it tomorrow. I know that i didn't fufill the requirements of the challenge ( but do i still get the reward?
PS. This is related to 2
