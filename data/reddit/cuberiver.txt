if you're not against bigger blocks, why do you support core who it against bigger blocks?
dig deeper and its easy to see blockstream is the true manipulator.

if price gets that high, we're going to need more block space...  let's not block the stream of transactions.

how is bitcoin going to be worth anything when it can only handle 3.7 tx/sec?  let's raise the block size already.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:10:32
transactions used to cost $0.05 or less, even feeless txs would confirm.  right now there's an 85,000 tx backlog.  theres no need to wait for a confirmation, why not just include the transactions.  0.1mb/min is the artificial limit that is holding us back here.  if bitcoin wants to scale that should be removed otherwise plenty of other coins are happy to handle it.

is it reasonable to ask which is cheaper, western union or BTC?  small blocks have got the bitcoin fee so high.
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:33:26
now lets raise the blocksize LIMIT to allow new users...
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:56:15
how about more than $0.45?

who defines spam exactly? i though bitcoin was a "peer to peer electronic cash system".  who put limits on cash and calls some users spammers when they try to use the system more than others?  banks and regulation come to mind.  bitcoin is (was?) supposed to replace banks...

how's he going to buy a candy bar with a $0.40 fee?  
increasing the block size would be something to smile about.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:41:46
OK, but one advantage of cryptocurrencies is that they can handle small transactions, like for coffee or lunch, without so much as a minimal fee.  in this digital age there's no need to pay credit card fees for a digital transaction set up the way bitcoin was.  the limit is artificial and we'd be unwise not to question its existence.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:49:54
banks are laughing at us celebrating our crippled electronic cash system.  can't go far without increasing the block size.
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:45:57
miners benefit from high fees and more blockchain space. if the network is allowed to grow they will profit!
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:49:36
... and yet nodes are relaying the transactions just fine.  
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:48:22
segwit isn't necessary... but unneccesarily risky.  all we need to do is increase block size.

the development cartel / blockstream
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:50:58
wake up, a cartel is currently keeping the block size at 1mb!
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:51:53
true, but they use social engineering to make people use their software.
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:37:50
yup, creating a current problem for the sake of preventing a hypothetical problem isn't good.  let's raise the block size.

the catmoon looks back waiting for BU to activate.

If it was possible to watch movies online in the 90's, but Comcast didn't allow it, would you stand by them too?
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:44:18
satoshi's plan doesn't need segwit.
edit: i see now that you were being sarcastic... lol

Paying huge transaction fees for months maybe years: Priceless.
