Following the recent Wizsec report, it is possible that some of the coins were routed back to MtGox, in order to exchange them for fiat - So why not request Tier 3 from creditors, to reduce a chance where "the thieves" are cashing out?
(oh, and thanks for your efforts on this!)

On checkout page, Bitcoin option is revealed only after pressing "$ Pay with card" button.
Can you make it visible as one of the main options?

The db was taken between 2/19/2014 1:17:00 AM and 2/21/2014 5:40:00 AM.
I crossed the balance from the db, with my mt.gox transaction history.
