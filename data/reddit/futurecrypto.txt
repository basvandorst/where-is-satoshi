Bitcoin must seem like FUD to you then.

I don't understand. Why would you give me QR code for Evil Corp when you want me to pay you? And what's so difficult about scanning the code and seeing what it is? The payment won't happen until I confirm it in my device.

All of his comments are retarded, not just that one.

It sweeps brain wallets. It's like finding wallets on the street, if you don't pick them someone else will.
@_date: 2015-01-29 05:49:15
Oh so you *are* a butthurt. Cool, glad you cleared that up.
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:36:32


And who's gonna trust their savings to a shitty closed source hardware wallet, whose developers have the maturity of a 5 y/o and are enthusiasts?
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:48:05
- Premined
- Wants your bitcoins
- Inflation to pay even more to devs
- Doesn't even exist
- Has more blog lines than lines of code
If that's not a shitcoin then I don't know what it is.
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:52:07


Yes, there was a discussion today on HN and the butt trolls were saying Bitcoin was centralized because Coinbase. Because, you know, no news can be good news for them.
@_date: 2015-01-22 05:59:50
But I'm all that and when I read  it looks like alien talk.

Let him feel smart.
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:41:27
I have written a brainwallet bot (and returned a few coins), but I want to be able to understand  (which I can't currently) or even contribute to Bitcoin or a Bitcoin company.

"Paper gold" has a use because physical gold is heavy and annoying.
"Paper bitcoin" is retarded. Who's gonna buy that shit?
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:13:17
Imagine it with gold. Some people want to invest in it but can't secure it themselves, so they use an ETF instead.

Why do people here hate QR codes? I "hate" copying and pasting addresses (let alone typing them), but QR codes are neat.

I have taken Crypto I at coursera.  is still alien talk. And most of them are not cryptographers anyway.

Don't you guys have your own sub? Why do you expect us to like a useless clone of Bitcoin?

"Buy Darkcoin, it's the future and it will replace Bitcoin because!" (I like this phrase because literally ALL shitcoins have used it in a lame attempt at creating FUD)
"Don't worry about Monero, Darkcoin will use ring signatures!" (you can't beat an altcoin in terms of development and you want to beat Bitcoin? lol)
"Oh wait no, ring signatures are hard and I'm no cryptographer so I won't implement them... But no biggie, it's still good! Pls!" (hehe, never listen to promises from altcoin creators)
"Bitcoin's Dark Wallet can't replace Darkcoin because" (shitcoin becoming redundant, like all other shitcoins)
"Pls buy some Darkcoin, you are totes missing out! :(" (final stage of shitcoin: desperation and bagholding)
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:51:27
Many of them are probably paid trolls. Others are silver fanboys and other Bitcoin haters, like that retard from youtube who now deleted his account, SirRawDog or something.

Ouch! And now buttcoin.org is owned by BFL. What does that say about the whole buttcoin movement?

What do you use the interface for? Other than creating a new repo or adding someone to it?
Besides I don't think it's bad, I actually like it more than Github's. It's almost like it's a matter of taste, no?

She said it in the context of Bitcoin, she even said "Bitcoin" before. So why not say Bitcoin now as well instead of what she said.

Don't believe me if you don't want to. But I'm sure this isn't the first sign you get of you going insane. Hasn't your family told you anything similar? What about your boss? Your friends?

The Litecoin brigade is here. All good comments will be downvoted to protect their spam.
@_date: 2015-02-03 03:13:25
Because they weren't willing to "tolerate a one world currency"? Or because they didn't know about gold or have any?
I'm pretty sure it's the latter.
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:19:15
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:09:05
Did you even read his comment? He was saying they should use Bitpay.
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:06:09
Dude, don't bother with these mods. There is no way they can say honestly believe the stupid shit they are saying. Odds are they have been coopted, like the mods from other influential subs like politics, technology, etc.

Oh yeah? And why did you also remove this post?

Well now they removed this post too. Enjoy the censorship (but only for actual bitcoiners, no censorship for trolls).
@_date: 2015-02-03 03:10:10
"Centralizing" everything on a decentralized system isn't the kind of centralization we are trying to escape from. That's just playing with words.
 &gt; There will always be alternative currencies and blockchains. Always.
Sure, and they will always suck. Anyone can download Bitcoin, change a few parameters and run an alternative chain, so of course altcoins won't go away in that sense.
@_date: 2015-02-13 01:39:16


Do you even English? No wonder someone who didn't go to school can only get a job as a paid troll.

Let the pump and dump commence again, am I right?
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:04:37
Aaand now they removed this post too.
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:00:20
Yeah I guess you will always prefer the way you learned over the way you didn't learn. I blame Github for this. They are teaching hipsters how to use git but using a workflow that is tightly coupled with Github.
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:26:43
Is this what you call "critical of bitcoin"? A guy constantly calling us all "a joke", and trolling every single thread with cherry-picked negative information and prepared phrases he compiles and shares with his team of trolls?
What kind of conversation can we have with such kinds of persons shitting all over the place?
Is this what you want for Bitcoin?
Have you been coopted? Yes or no.
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:07:32


So instead of banning them, you let them shit all over the place. Good job!
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:29:01
If by "fine" you mean "100% centralized to avoid being raped" then sure, it's doing just fine.

A number of "members" like yourself? Who are actually just trying to pump random shitcoins created by web devs with no previous background in cryptography, like your god Evan? And also other "members" like the butthurts, who will upvote literally *anything* that goes against Bitcoin?

@_date: 2015-02-13 02:23:52


Wrong. That's not the topic of that post. The topic is asking why it's not possible. It's not saying it's not necessary.
You need to work on your reading comprehension skills.
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:42:30


Yes it is


Do you really need to carry ALL your coins everywhere? That's pretty dumb. But if you insist, then why not use a *secure* portable device like, you know, a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:40:23
Anonymous, except they need all your data.
Free, except it has at least 2% tax per year.
Uncomplicated, except it's a pain in the ass and it will fail when you need it the most.
Hardware independent, except it's paper.
Does not depend on an intermediary, unless you want to move it across imaginary borders that are all over the planet.
Quick, except you have to wait for a freaking truck.

Tell me more about how Darkcoin is an "actual innovation" when comparing it to Bitcoin, lol...


Poor guy, he's getting Bitcoin information in when trying to spam about Darkcoin :*(


Oh yeah?

What's the joke?
@_date: 2015-02-13 02:16:50
Since you are mocking me, can you explain how to reward full nodes in a way that can't be exploited? Or mocking is all you have as argument?
And try to explain that without saying "buy buy buy my shitcoin of choice" nor "PoS is secure and not a flawed concept".
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:28:44

By that logic, an excel spreadsheet is also less wasteful. That doesn't mean we can call that a less wasteful alternative, because it has nothing to do with secure distributed consensus. It simply isn't secure. See what happened with Peercoin and Stellar.

Don't learn "github", learn git. Github is just a centralized website that profited by using git (a decentralized source version control, created by Linus, creator of Linux) in its name. And when you need to host your git repository you can just use Bitbucket, which lets you have private repositories for free.

Shitcoins, shitcoins everywhere.
@_date: 2015-02-13 01:37:19
Can you show us at least 1 person who said that? Because it seems like you are just pulling things out of your ass to attack Bitcoin. For instance, nobody ever said incentives for nodes are not necessary, it's just that there is no known way of doing that because it could be exploited.
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:37:51
Hehe, everyone has a "whitepaper" these days, even shitcoins like Darkcoin.
