Do you think this is the reason for the recent decrease of price? Anyway if that would be the case, the volume would still had to be high since a large amount of bitcoin would  have to be traded to alts or fiat. As far as I know volume means the total amount of bitcoin traded in a specific time frame. Selling a large amount of bitcoin in a short period of time should come with high volume also but the chart in the link I posted shows low volumes for the past few days.

Helping someone to do something that you will benefit from doesn't make you a labrat.

Thanks for pointing out this issue. Do you have some other suggestions?  Very few people filled out and I'm trying to figure out what went wrong.

Don't be absurd. I'm a psychology student and I need to make a survey for a project at the University and I thought it would be interesting to do something on cryptocurrencies. After I collect enough responses I will write an article about the findings and will share it with everyone. The results might not only be interesting but also useful for you.

What do you think a "serious scientific study" should be like? To measure what I want I'm using the need for cognition scale which is an instrument that has been used many times by psychologist on "serious studies". Reddit is a good place to share this because the people have diverse opinions and all I'm interested in is how popular are some of these opinions and how they related to thinking patterns.
