Funny thing is, 5% is probably less than what percentage LocalBitcoins currently is of the total exchange volume
Think about how much 'waste' there is in using LocaBitcoins: Two people have to waste their time and resources to meet up, and it doesn't even come with the security of an armored vehicle with an escort - you just have to hope 'Mahmoud23q' doesn't rob you of your cash or hold you up for access to your shitcoins

What did I tell you folks.. like vapor ayy lmao.. shitcoiners are predictable as fuck
BTW you're the one who made the claim, so you should have been prepared to back it up. Now you've just made a fool of yourself. No proof, so GTFO

Microsoft is a traditional tech company
Indexes are pretty much the only exception. This includes webpage indexes (i.e. Google), torrent indexes, music indexes, etc.
When it comes to the areas you're talking about though - television, film, newspaper, and radio - how many websites are *not* owned by traditional media companies?
For instance, all of the following websites are owned by IAC chaired and largely owned since 1995 by the [co-creator]( of Fox Broadcasting Company and USA Broadcasting (also former chairman of Paramount Pictures, Vivendi Universal, Fox Inc.):
The Daily Beast
This doesn't include all the entities it has since spun out into separate companies (like Reddit has been spun out from Advance Publications) over the years, such as Home Shopping Network, Ticketmaster, Expedia (incl. TripAdvisor), etc.

You think a fraud is going to use his real name?
One way of going about it would be creating a bank account with a faked identity, an easier way would be a skimmed debit card + a tossed out/stolen bank statement showing the account number (you might even be able to get the number with just the card). An advantage of that is that the person who got their card stolen probably wouldn't care or even notice if its being used, because the balance would remain the same.


You arrange a meeting with 'Mahmoud23q' in a bank branch to buy Bitcoins. As he takes out his smartphone to transfer the Bitcoins to your wallet, which you verify on your own smartphone/laptop/tablet, you hand him the cash in return.
You decide to hang around for a little while after Mahmoud leaves, perhaps to do some banking, or shopping if its in a shopping centre, or just to feel safe.
Whatever your course of action, you eventually leave the populated public place for where you've parked your car.
As you're about to enter your car, Mahmoud, who has been patiently watching and waiting for you, jumps you and demands you to transfer the Bitcoins from your smartphone/laptop/tablet to him. He's probably armed with a knife or a handgun, and he probably has a buddy or two with him to back him up.
Or if you've parked your car where there is people around, he follows you until you reach your home and then seizes the opportunity.


You don't know about online banking? You don't need to go into a bank branch to do a bank transfer. 
Where I live (Australia), bank transfers are free and usually arrive after 1 day, but if you're in the US services like Google Wallet and Paypal allow you to send cash instantly and without fees (personal accounts are not charged fees)

Oh and btw.. Localbitcoins was created in June 2012.. you said you bought in 2011..

Guy could have done a runner with your money at that point
We're talking about the small fraction of real-life scenarios where digital transfers are not an option.
As you've just demonstrated through your example, cash can already be transferred just as easily and cheaply as Bitcoin can (cheaper in fact) - but that's not what we're talking about.

Oh look, it's another one of these 'I bought at $5' shills again
Provide proof or GTFO
I.e. Link address on blockchain.info, and prove ownership of it. Only takes about 30 seconds and wouldn't cost you anything.
Watch this shill dissipate into thin air lmao

You do realize you're posting on a website basically owned by [Advance Publications]( right?

It took you over an hour to come around after being knocked out stone cold
BTW how's your Monero 'investment' going? LMAO
