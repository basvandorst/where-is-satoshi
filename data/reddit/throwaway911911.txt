It doesn't matter to me. I use bitcoins. The fact that the receiver converts them to dollars via gift card for a few seconds before I get my merchandise is of minor consequence to me. I still spend bitcoins and get my merchandise with greatly reduced risk which makes the risk negligible.
EDIT (for the benefit of I only expose myself to the gift card (counterparty risk) for a brief moment and only for a specific amount to satisfy the specific pending transaction. This is more preferable than leaving ALL of my funds in the care of someone else until I need to ask them permission to spend them.

I'm not sure what you mean. I think you misunderstood my post. My point is that I know the US Gov is issuing debt to finance endless wars and wreak terror across the planet. I want nothing to do with it. Refusing to hold dollars any more than I have to is one small step.

Yup. My conviction level is now higher than it ever was before. There is no comparison to the ease of using bitcoins. I spend bitcoin every day through services like eGifter.com, Gyft.com, Purse.io, etc., etc. 
I have a steady flow of buyers &amp; sellers coming to me through Local Trader (Mycelium), LocalBitcoins.com and from my past, happy trading partners so that I always have liquidity if I need it. Now I rarely go into banks. The teller remarked to me the other day - "I never see you any more." Thank God!

Gresham's Law really only applies when both moneys are legal tender. In the absence of legal tender laws we can see "Thier's Law":

If I was selling a home then I would wait for 6 confirmations. For everyday transactions I consider 1 confirmation plenty considering the current hashing power and the costs involved in mounting a double-spend attack. 
EDIT: OP makes a good point though - I've had transactions reversed when a fee wasn't included. This has happened too often for my comfort so I now wait for 1 confirmation unless it is a close, trusted friend who will make good on a rejected transaction.

Are you using the reference client (BitcoinQT)? If it doesn't show up on the blockchain then the transaction probably got "hung up" and never left your wallet and should show back up. You might need to give your client a little time to update the blockchain transaction history in order for this to reflect properly.
@_date: 2014-07-15 05:17:49

They did leave in droves. Market share went from 80% to 20% before the collapse. You, OP, seem to be seeking a world where crime and stupidity don't exist. At least in MtGox's case the losses were primarily limited to the Gox customers who are now being weeded out in a form of "natural selection". 
Fortunately, those of us who saw the writing on the wall, are not forced to absorb their losses (bailouts paid for from taxpayer money).
People need to go back and read the original whitepaper. The purpose of Bitcoin was to cut out (un)trusted middleman like banks and exchanges. Bitcoin was created to be "peer to peer".

Nothing wrong if you are fully informed and are willing to accept the risk. It's like playing a game if musical chairs - someone's going to get left without a seat except the players don't know there is one less seat. The real problem is that this fractional reserve lending isn't really made clear to the average person. Bankers don't go out of their way to inform the average customer (not that it is their responsibility either). If the average person knew of this risk they might think differently about where they store their money.
You nailed the problem of socializing losses by having them paid for by taxpayer money used for bailing out bankers.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:25:51


Irrelevant. Theft is still theft. The dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power since the inception of the Federal Reserve in 1913.


So are you telling me that interfering with someone else's life, liberty and property (when harming no one else) is not immoral?


Eventually, yes, the printing press is used to finance the "endless wars". When they can't raise taxes any more (theft) they run the printing presses to pay off the debt.

Of course it is. When they print money and inject it into the system - by buying bonds or paying off the military industrial/spy complex - they are giving these actors first use of the funds who profit at the loss of everybody else who may or may not see some of these funds further on down the chain and only after the general price level has risen. 
You are assuming the average citizen has full knowledge and notice of these purchases/expenditures. Not so. When "black budget" expenditures are made without public knowledge it is deceptive at the very least.

If I would have been worried about risk I would have sold out after the first crash. All my friends sold me their bitcoins at every past bubble. I bought a bunch at the bubble of $12. More at the bubble of $18. More at the bubble of $64. More at the bubble at $264. More at the bubble of $1,100. Guess what? I'm still buying because I don't want dollars and I see no other asset that has more to offer me. Either you believe in the principles of bitcoin or you don't. I back up my beliefs with my money. FWIW, I don't know where you got your numbers...

Still cheaper than the current alternative: incalculable cost of lives lost to endless wars financed by perpetual debit-issued fiat.

Autarchy is more of a conscious act. It is the recognition that our long-term well being often relies on overcoming our own short-term impulses. Using the term "anarchist" has too many negative connotations and it usually pits people against your cause before you even have the chance to explain it since most people associate "anarchy" with "chaos". "Anarchists" tend to get lumped into the "molotov cocktail-throwing" crowd. Autarchy also means "self-control". It is a more mature and sophisticated form of anarchy.

As Erik Voorhees said: "I already cashed out. I cashed out of dollars into bitcoins."

I would argue that "Capitalism" is the "private ownership of capital". Not the corporate/state partnership that has been mis-labeled "capitalism" of late. A non-bastardized term is a "private property society".

It's pretty easy to legally avoid taxes if one is determined to.

Yes, there's some great gems in there.

Yup, LocalBitcoins.com is the way to go. Start building your local, personal trading network now so you can have liquidity later. Forget dealing through banks - bitcoin was created to eliminate them.

My crystal ball says $1,300 to $2,400 before a 40% + drop. Let's see if my prediction makes me a genius or a fool in the coming months! :p

What, don't you own any capital?

Consider keeping a small pile of bitcoins for the long term. If they hit $1,000,000 each - like some people predict - he won't regret it.
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:44:53
I'll go out on a limb and predict this will happen in the next 12 months.

Bitcoin itself is a great offshore account provided you keep your own wallet secured.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:04:43
That's what they said at $30, at $85, at $100, at $266, at $300, you get the picture. The truth is nobody knows but the market is telling us the price at this moment in time. Personally, I see the market value at $100,000+ therefore I'm a consistent buyer at these prices. Yes, we will go through periods of "overbought" to "oversold" but timing the market is a gamble. Right now I'm more worried about holding dollars than bitcoins. The Fed printed 20 times the current market cap of bitcoins last month. They've been doing that every month for a few years now. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:31:50
Correct. With bitcoins there is no longer a real need for offshore bank accounts.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:43:06
LocalBitcoins.com is the best. Be wary of accepting PayPal for your coins as there are high incidences of chargebacks due to stolen PayPal accounts. Personally, I would never accept PayPal for bitcoins.

In the picture of this article they look a little more "bad ass" under that headline.

Very good question. Bullion-backed currencies are unlikely to gain much market share due to the fact that the "backing" is vulnerable to government theft. That was the weak link in e-Gold and the other "backed" digital currencies. 
Bitcoin removes the need for "backing" because it becomes the commodity itself - thus having no need for "backing". 
Another way of looking at this is that neither gold nor silver are backed by anything - they are valued only for what they are and what they enable you to do. It is the same for Bitcoin.

Yes, a devalued dollar will push up the nominal values of all assets. I think Bitcoin will appreciate significantly more for two reasons:
1. It has a lot of catching up to do.
2. It's simply a better store of value/medium of exchange (in my opinion)

Great interview - I love Jeff's response to "there's no way to guard [against the thefts]".

Sounds great until you find out the PayPal funds you sold your coins for are from a hacked account - and they are reversed on you leaving you "coinless". 
TL;DR: Don't ever trade your coins for inferior, reversible currencies.

I make it a point to convert most of my monthly income to bitcoins and then spend it off as I need it - keeping some in savings. That way I am a net saver every month while supporting bitcoin businesses. Sure, the value can go down during the month but, most of the time, it creeps up in value and I get a raise every month. BTW, I use Gyft &amp; eGifter quite a bit.
