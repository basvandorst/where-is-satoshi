Correct! I missed the first incorrect one he used. I was referring to the second one.

Don't have a cow man

Nope. He used "it's" correctly. It's used when saying "it is" or "it has".

Compared to me buying in close to ATH, it's a fucking great buy in price.

I wish I bought in at 9K. You think you've got problems, try doubling that figure.

When moon? 
I've been waiting for my lambos since I bought in on 13th December 2017.
62% down and I'm so loving crypto lol
You can all thank me for contributing to ATH ��

Wtf is going on?

Yes, you are correct; it was a lame attempt at humour on my part.
I would especially like to apologise to any Nigerian Princes that I may have offended.

No need to panic; it's all good. Apparently it's very popular in Africa.

I'm an Aussie and we usually give shit to Kiwis but there is nothing wrong with them celebrating their heritage.
It's a war cry and while it looks quite threatening, Maori are actually quite civil and peaceful people. 
It's pretty awesome when seen in person i.e. International Rugby Union matches.
