I'm more bothered by his policies such as decimation of welfare programs, promotion of the war on drugs, the three strikes rule, neoliberal economic policies and such. Bombing Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, essentially starving Iraq of any medicine or food, trying to destroy Cuba economically ...

They've been involved since the 1970's-1990's. Well it's impossible to think what Reagan was thinking, but we know he was an extreme racist. It's also been revealed that Nixon's war on drugs targeted blacks and hippies, two groups who threatened the existing political structure ...

Doubt it, that's why the CIA kept being involved in cocaine trafficking at the scale they were.
The drug problem was studied years ago by the RAND corporation and the US Military - a pure cost-benefit analysis. They found that treatment and education are the most cost effective way to deal with the drug problem, and that prohibition was the most costly and ineffective means of dealing with it. So the government knows that it's not a good way to combat the actual drug problem. The real reason for the war on drugs is to create more fear, which allows the government greater control of the population.

Sure there is, things don't have to be owned. Take public roads for instance. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:00:46
Serious question though, how will you build roads in such a society? Taxes seem like a logical way to do it for me.

Well the police are really created for two purposes - to prevent political uprisings and to protect private property. Their function is misunderstood. They're not there to serve &amp; protect or prevent crime. They are also a modern creation, the first police were only created in the mid 19th century in London.

I think a lot of people are disillusioned with democracy because what we call "democracy" is really rule by elites with a thin veneer. The US has been largely business run and business dominated for centuries. I agree we should move to some form of electronic direct democracy. Of course no such move is even contemplated, for obvious reasons.

Furthermore if the government controls the banking system and money, how are you supposed to realise your bitcoin wealth? They could block that too! And it would be quite inconvenient. For this reason it would be difficult for the current government system to accept cryptocurrencies as mainstream. It represents a threat to their power. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:57:29
There are a lot of problems with having a system of private roads if you think about it for 5 minutes. Makes a lot more sense that public roads are owned by the public. 
I'd also like to know more about that, interesting snippet of history. Where can I read about it?
@_date: 2017-04-29 22:15:08
I agree with you that a central body shouldn't run everything, and will usually tend to corruption. That's why I'm kind of an anarchist in my political thought. 
It's important to recognize that the US is just a centrally planned as the USSR was, only the central body consists of an amalgamation of government and business elites acting in close concert rather than pure government. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:01:30
Well of course it would be voluntary that's the point of a democracy- it's not imposed from some tyrant. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 22:35:11
In a tyrannically society you don't need media manipulation, you just beat up whoever disagrees with you. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:16:34
Anarchism is, for me, the extension of democracy into every day life including the workplace. But I'm an anarchist-syndicalist whereas I take it you're an "anarcho-capitalist".

I know you can. I didn't say it was a labor camp. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 22:20:23
Neither is the state a purely tyrannical entity which maintains power entirely by force (we don't have storm troopers and the like). They know that won't be tolerated. Rather it's a mixture of democracy, tyranny and media manipulation that basically maintains control. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:34:14
Actually markets can by highly inefficient, irrational and unfair. There are phenomenon like monopolies, collusion and hype/bubble cycles which are all flaws of markets. 
Central planning isn't necessarily inefficient. For example corporations are centrally planned and highly efficient, they've basically taken over the world. 
As I said, in a truly democratic society taxation would not be coercive and we would be involved in how it gets spent. I would have no problem with that. In fact I have no problem paying taxes, as someone else wrote, say for local resources. But for foreign wars of course not. Naturally the populace is never consulted on such issues. We don't live in a real democracy!
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:41:03
It depends. I have no problem with privately owned small business, let's call it a "mom and pop" store. But it must be recognised that the internal structure of corporations are tyrannical. The boss gives the orders and the employees follow the orders. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 19:50:52
We live in a highly propagandised world and yes voters are certainly manipulated constantly. Have you read Chomsky's theories of propaganda? I don't think we should throw away democracy for that reason though! Rather mass media should be democratically owned.

Been a bitcoiner for a long time ($3) then became a fan of Chomsky much later which turned me on to anarcho-syndicalism. Occasionally a post from is intriguing enough for me to come post.

If a government is a true democracy then we would be happy to pay taxes. It would be a time when we get together and decide what we are going to spend our money on for ourselves. The degree to which taxes are loathed indicates the degree to which our government is not a true democracy. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:38:54
Basicslly what i see here is there's a profound disconnect with "the government" and "the people". We have forgotten that the people are supposed to have come together to form a government. Clearly the government is considered outside of the people. Look at the reaction on tax day. For most people it's that some external entity has come to sieze their money. It's very telling. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 19:02:19
We're all individuals but we are more than just individuals. We all have obligations, responsibilities, families, relationships and such.

I believe in equality - meritocracy for me implies that some people are superior to others, something which I personally reject. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 21:39:05
The private ones? Yes they are open at the whims of the owners. That's tyrannical. I don't think public roads should be operated for private profit, I think that's very corrupt. Assuming the road was sold to an individual - that someone is granted a money making machine, at the expense of the population. Look at the private parking meters in Chicago. Bigger costs for the population, for private profit. And it's a captive audience!
If they're public toll roads that's a different matter. But why not just tax fuel or income instead?
@_date: 2017-04-29 20:38:11


This is a very important point. And it's difficult to stop because as soon as any corporation gets larger it's influence on government naturally grows. The population has to remain vigilant constantly against this corrosive effect. It's reached the point now where we are basically ruled by these large corporations (in alliance with government), they write the laws to suit themselves. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 19:49:34
What about them? 
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:43:15
Well of course a free market would be part of that. But there's nothing wrong with getting together and building roads together right?
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:47:29
The European system is so far removed from that. Look at how politicians are selected - basically they're preselected for us and we can pick between them. In a real democracy they would be selected from their communities and their policies would represent the will of the people. If you look at how most politicians campaign, they try to avoid talking about policies and avoid things that matter - they focus on sideshow issues. 
Also in Europe power has become very centralised in Brussels which is in the thrall of big capital. Countries don't have any independent monetary policy anymore, it's all dictated from Brussels. Neither do they have a system where a richer state can subsidise a poorer one like say Germany helping Greece, as say California in America will help subsidise the poorer states. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 20:29:52
There are degrees though, of plutocracy and democracy, and of course we'll never have a perfect democracy or government. The current government though in the US is very much dominated by business and wealthy people. It always has been. Look for example at Congress approval ratings, they're in the single digits. 
I think central planning could easily redistribute resources. They're just not interested in doing so, why should they? It's not a problem of price information but will. Poverty and joblessness could easily be ended by the government. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 22:17:21
That's why I said in theory. It is a "democracy" (depends how you define democracy of courses) although a pretty weak form of democracy. and it's being steadily eroded. In truth though the people have all the power, they just don't realize it. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 05:42:11

The idea of privately owned roads quickly becomes absurd - in fact it's a tyrannical system basically.

Private property per se is not tyrannical, once it affects my daily commute, I would consider that tyrannical. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:23:28
Maybe that's true, maybe we could have a system of councils which are selected from the population.

The problem I have with private roads is that it is a tyrannical system - whoever owns that road can do what they want with it, to the detriment of everyone else. It also makes things complicated. Far more simple to have them public, as it is in most of the world, and works just fine. Everyone can use them and benefit.

It depends on whether you care that say the widow across the street has enough to eat, or the kids of your neighbours go to school, even if you don't have kids. If you only care about yourself, the. You wouldn't want to pay taxes. If you see yourself as part of a community that you care about and participate in, you would have no problem with it.

He never claimed Churchill was running the British government prior to the rise of the 3rd Reich. And he's certainly factually correct that prior to WW2 the worst global atrocities had been committed by the Allied countries in their imperial domains. Take the British rule of India, it was incredibly savage, very similar to the Nazi's. In fact Hitler was a great admirer of it. The point is that WW2 is a bit more complex than just Allies=good.

Not really I think governments could drive bitcoin completely underground and make things very difficult for us, and make people scared of bitcoin.

Well that I can agree with.

We must remember that governments also in theory, only exist at our behest and that we should be able to dissolve them as we see fit, if it is a democracy.

Well they do, they support the complete unregulation of private property owners, in other words the right to do whatever you want with your private property, which is a massive gift to huge corporations, which are essentially private tyrannies - not democratic entities.
@_date: 2016-07-23 06:32:54
A tyranny means there's a boss who gives orders and they must be followed. This is exactly the structure of a corporation. It has an owner and workers, and the boss/owner gives orders. That's it. Now anarcho-syndicalists believe that the workers should own the factory or workplace, and that all major institutions should be publicly owned - the extension of democracy into the industrial sphere. Anarcho capitalists believe in strong property rights, meaning the rights of the owners of businesses, land etc.
@_date: 2016-07-09 13:48:33
