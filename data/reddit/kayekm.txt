Indeed.  I shouldn't be surprised since Andreesen himself is about as pro-state as a person can get, but the arrogance of these VC guys is infuriating to me.  They barely understand the technology they are investing in and yet have the gall to casually demean basically everyone who poured their heart into helping bitcoin grow and survive its infancy.  Basically what they're saying is "The big money is here now.  You extremist nuts who believe in crazy ideas like de-politicized currency can go sit at the kids table while we turn this baby into visa with lower fees... And don't say anything or I'll slap you with my wallet!"

Ulbricht never hired any hitmen.  The state always tries to sway public opinion by listing every indictment under the sun (which, of course, the media unquestioningly reports).  When it came time to charge him, all the indictments of violent crime (ie. actual crimes) were dropped.

Honestly, I've found the bitcoin community to be the opposite of greedy or selfish.  Whether it's helping to feed the homeless, chipping in for hurricane relief in the Phillipines, or just sending some guy 24btc because he held up a sign with a QR code on ESPN, bitcoiners are extremely generous.  The main use for bitcoin, as of 5 months ago, was still charitable giving.  I understand that many in the community can come off as a little stern on reddit.  
My take on this is that there is a sense that this is bitcoin's emergence and no time to waver philosophically.  While I would prefer if others showed a little more patience and empathy for those who comment about the "need for regulation ('legitimacy')" and ask questions like "how do I pay my taxes in bitcoin?", I understand why there is this immediate biting of the head off.

Regulations don't do anything to curb insider trading, they institutionalise it (see HSBC, Citibank etc.).  In a free and open market place, like we are building with bitcoin, the punishment for acting unethically is to have your reputation destroyed and to lose business to your competitors.  Though competiton to Mt. Gox is still very limited (Gox had a massive first-mover advantage in the exchange market), there are places like CoinMKT that are welcoming "former Mt. Gox traders" - basically saying, "come trade with us, we aren't scumbags."

Tell me, good sir, what is government comprised of if not individuals?  Puppies?  Those who call themselves "the government" are not only individuals just like the rest of us peons, but they are the worst kind of individuals.  They are those who would seek to rule over others - to punish and coerce while telling those who complain it is for their own good.

Woah. Sticks and stones there, mate.  This conference was marketed from day one as community-driven.  The vast majority of bitcoin conferences are industry-focused with panels on regulatory compliance and "how bitcoin 'fits in' to today's financial paradigm."  The whole point of this was to provide a more philosophical perspective.

Thanks so much for posting your experiences.  The 29.4% premine of Ethereum is atrocious and impossible to really defend.  Allowing any premine at all reeks of a pyramid scheme.  If there are funding concerns I would feel a lot better if they simply did an indie go go/kickstarter-type thing a la Dark Wallet.  There is definitely a disconnect between how the Ethereum team is acting and their pro-ported values.

I really goes to the top of By using the figures of Charlie Shrem, Ross Ulbricht, Amir Taaki and the CEO of Coinbase (name escapes me), Cody weaves a really interesting and abrasive narrative that asks all those who seek "legitimacy" for bitcoin to rethink to their pandering.

I agree that the future is still unbelievably bright for bitcoin, but I really feel for those who invested a large portion of their life savings and are feeling pretty darn fearful right now.  As someone who purchased at $900 I know the pain.

It is a major setback.  Demand for btc in China has really been driving the price rise from about the $120 mark.  China is a huge market of largely tech savvy savers so we could easily visit the low $300 range as all of this shakes out.

I really think it's worthwhile re-itterating a point made on a recent episode of Let's Talk Bitcoin: 
Contrary to the notion that the fall of Gox being due to a lack of government regulation, it is government regulation that is to blame for so many people losing their shirts to Karpeles and Co...  No-one really wanted to use Gox, but it was the only option for so long because anyone who tried to open an exchange in the U.S. was (and still are) being held up by a host of regulatory agencies all wanting payoffs (licenses, permits, lobbyists to wine and dine 'em).  Gox had this captured market for years and everyone had to tolerate their incompetence because there literally were no other options.  If there had been no barriers to entry there would have been an abundance of exchanges all of the world years ago, and customers would have been free to choose which to do business with.  Gox would never have been able to compete and its demise would have been far less devastating.

The only thing that is bullshit is this PR stunt.  For starters, if Buffett truly wanted to pay the IRS more money he could easily send them a cheque to ease his troubled conscience.  It's not like they'd send the money back saying "No, no - you're far too kind." I've never heard anyone say, "I want to give more money to the United Way, but for since they haven't forced me to I guess I won't."  Only the most naive progressive would buy a spin this transparent.
More insidious still is the fact that Buffett made billions in bailouts.  When his biggest holdings were being rescued by stolen money (in the form of taxes) he never once said: "Hey, this isn't right.  Why are you using tax money to bail out banks and major corporations.  Let them go bankrupt, I can survive losing $15billion or so.  Use the money for soup kitchens instead."  Nope, he didn't say shit.  He took it, paid himself and his shareholders handsomely with public funds and became even wealthier during a period when everyone else was suffering.

Stefan and Andreas are both very talented speakers and debaters.  Stef just tends to get overly-antagonistic in his attempts to "beat" someone else.

Do not fear, sir/mam.
Bitcoin is still in its highly-volatile infancy.  As someone who suffered through both of the major bitcoin "crashes" (from $33 and then $265), take it from me that bitcoin is too revolutionary to be undermined by governmental bureaucrats.  Bitcoin will win the day, and these gut-wrenching roller coaster rides will smooth out as more and more infrastructure is built around the protocol.  Just wait a couple of months - me thinks we will have conquered another moon :)

Here in Christchurch, New Zealand, it's a real struggle to get people to embrace technology.  It's frustrating since, as a fairly well-off country of only 4 million people, it could be the first nation to really go full bitcoin.
