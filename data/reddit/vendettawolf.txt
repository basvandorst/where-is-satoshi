Yup, MtGox wasn't seized by The U.S. Government.
Instead the Gov seized one Dwolla account, The MtGox to dwolla account I think.

Demand and supply definitely have an effect on the price of bitcoins against the dollar (other currencies) as more people demand bitcoins the price should go up as there is limited supply. It is the same to an extent for gold (limited supply) high demand.

of course

As a Bitcoin holder I saw the fall as a chance to buy more bitcoins.
The more people who see bitcoin as deflationary, and other currencies as inflationary the more people will try to buy bitcoins, and more demand with a limited supply = Rise in prices for bitcoins (which is good lol).
So im not sure what lay ahead in terms of the Bitcoin all I know is the Dollar and pound are steadily losing value and Bitcoin volatile as it is generally increases in value.

Not ripple alone but ripples specifically as a place to exchange bitcoins 
For example they said on ripple site 
" Currency exchange is built into the Ripple network, allowing people to pay and receive in their preferred currency, including Bitcoin "

1. Generally you can guess what the short term price of Bitcoins will be by Checking the latest news (some news may cause panic selling thus the prices will go lower , other news will show better bitcoin integration which may lead to more demand and thus a higher price) , how ever it depends on the size of the story, In the long term its hard to make an accurate prediction Because we don't know the news of the future to well. However if your community keeps track of bitcoin it prices vs other currencies then you might be able to handle it. Its a nice idea , Good-luck.

Nothing new, but googles investment in this company might make it something to watch. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:49:55
What do you think will happen if there was a big attack like this, Would it recover ? Im not sure, as long as people dont get to scared and think bitcoin will gain value in the long run then demand ill increase causing prices to increase, However an attack is likely to cause panic (for it is its aim)
