To answer your question I though I heard coinbase was available in Greece?  I am probably wrong.

Greeks have already reportedly begun to stash euros in safety deposit boxes and under mattresses .

I wrote a comment on the actual article.
I said I saw no facts to support the claim and said I hope they are using the blockchain instead of fiat because at least that way a capable law enforcement could keep backtracking it to the source, but better yet track it when it came out.   My comment was deleted.. This may very well be the start of a coordinated media smear campaign by big money that sold off too many bitcoins to drop the price and miscalculated they would be able to buy back cheap.

Moves are not done the day of.  They have already been made.

My question s why do they want bitcoin instead of Euro?  They can/could get Euro out which will hold value if Greece collapses.  I am not sure they will be able to spend bitcoin over there for food etc should things go south.
I am being serious what advantages do they see from bitcoin over gold/euro etc at the moment in Greece?  I  am not arguing :)
Also, to be clear I think btc/usd will still be affected greatly for a while from Greece fallout, just not sure people understand why it should/shouldn't.

What I don't get about all this is when someone gets money out in Greece at the moment it is Euro right?  So why would they scramble to buy bitcoin with Euro  that will still hold value after any collapse?  I could see if they were withdrawing drachma a need to convert it quickly.
Anyways, don't get me wrong I am not saying this situation will not keep driving btc/usd prices.

That is what I am thinking sadly.  Without the uneducated Greece/bitcoin affect though I figured btc/usd charts were about to start looking good anyways.

Ohh and if you can find out what the word on the street as to why they think bitcoin is better then other options atm that would be great!  Maybe they are thinking of something we aren't, or again they don't fully understand it.   Either way it would be good info for us.
