If you found a way to send it with 0 mining fee, then it's at least a day. If you sent too low of a fee, it still might go through.
The default in bitcoin-core is 72 hours to expire unconfirmed transactions, so at least it shouldn't be longer than that!
There's also some geeky ways to resend the same transaction with a higher fee.

If someone is just storing bitcoins, that is all well and good, but if you want to speculate on markets, we don't have much choice. Those of us that use exchanges and keep balances on them should know what they're risking, if not then that's on them.

Twitter is awful for discussion, it's just bite sized text thrown into the internet with no intention of being scrutinized. Either way you get biased people saying the same things. Do opposing views scare you? You can actually read things without believing them. I don't like argument from authority as a method for determining truth.
Contrast with reddit having a vote system for interesting stuff at the top, where you can have threaded comments with unlimited post sizes. Then I can just decide for myself based on facts, not based on who the cool kids are.

I must be too close to this to get the joke. Wasn't it good news when gox finally died? They were an embarassment, I had to tell new people to ignore the gox price since it was always off, and now I dont have to. And we all knew banks and politicians would fight adoption since the start. Its more like, thisisactuallynotnews when economists/senators/countries try to stop bitcoin. Its not completely good news in every way, but all of those examples are not doom for Bitcoin by any means. I don't get it, wasn't it good news when gox shut down? It sucks for people that had money in an exchange that was well known for being hard to get money out of, but was it bad news that it is finally over with gox? Would we be better off if gox was still around, or if they were bailed out? Gah, I don't get it. It actually IS good news when things that should fail are allowed to fail.

If someone isn't good at keeping their coins secure, they could just outsource it to a trusted party like coinbase.com, and enable 2FA. Assuming the company doesn't go out of business, the attacker would have to get your password, and access to your 2FA, or access to your PC.
Of course its better to do things like paper wallets for the larger sums, but the topic was security for mainstream acceptance.
Before people say that its like going back to using banks, the difference is this time it is OPTIONAL. We can be banks, or choose to use a service to provide that. It feels good having the freedom to decide. Bitcoin is a platform, it amuses me when people act like it shouldn't be built on.

I guess I have to spell it out. You would trade the private keys with equal balances minus whatever premium they want to charge, perhaps with an escrow to make sure people don't get ripped off. By trading the private keys instead of "spending" anything, nothing is documented.
Ideally ruining fungability won't catch on since it would make Bitcoin not satisfy a critical defining characteristic to ever be "currency", and we won't have to worry about it. I was just predicting one way people would cope with the stupidity. I'm sure if any of us put more than a minute of thought into it, we could come up with even better ways to render whitelisting addresses untenable.

If someone uses Bitcoins to buy something, they could use coinbase or circle, and do an instant buy, then spend the bitcoins, then the merchant can use bitpay or coinbase and instantly sell. That is my preferred way of using bitcoins, and that won't make the price go to the moon until merchant adoption reaches critical mass. If people are waiting for lots more people just buying and hoarding out of greed, it might take awhile. I love Bitcoin, and I love spending it at any merchant that accepts it. But I only have a small amount, but more than I keep cash in my wallet or house. I just don't tie the price to success, I think success comes from when most places accept it for payment. While the price is volatile, people can use any of the exchanges that can lock the price, both buyers and sellers can instantly buy and sell and protect themselves from price fluctuation.

coinbase.com is currently the best way to obtain Bitcoins if you live in the US, the fees are lower than anyone right now, and they are a legit company. You just link your bank account to it and can do transfers for a 1% fee. That being said, using them is not really Bitcoin in the pure sense, since you don't get the private keys, they are like a bank. What you get is a big IOU for Bitcoins. So what you can do is buy them, then send those Bitcoins to another wallet where you do have the private keys, the best option for investing being a paper wallet. Or if you want to just store them at coinbase.com, that's fine, they will PROBABLY not just disappear with all of your bitcoins, but it is technically possible. But that is another huge topic, so yes they are reputable for purchasing Bitcoins, but I would consider storing them on a paper wallet. If you go that route, just practice with smaller amounts first, send like 50 cents worth, and make sure you can retrieve it (send it to yourself at another wallet).
The other option being hyped is circle.com, but they are in invite only mode right now, so it's not an option you can just use today. No harm in signing up for an invite now though.
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:55:33
I'm going to fight "bits" until its clear everyone just loves it, then I'll just suck it up and conform. Bits sounds too much like Bitcoins, and we already had a word for microbits and millibits. Also millibits is more useful in daily use, since one of them is worth about 50 cents. A "bit" is 5% of a penny. I have been thinking in millibits for a long time, and its just messing up my brain to have to move the decimal place over 3 places for no good reason. And finally, if people want to use worthless values, why not just go two more decimal places and use Satoshis?

So if I was the customer making the payment and clicked that "pay with coinbase" button it could take me to a page that asks to link to my coinbase account.
I'm not sure how that is done, I don't have the API enabled, and it was like a facebook type of integration, it took me to a page on coinbase.com that asked me to approve it, and it listed them in "Third Party Applications", and they were able to charge my coinbase account without prompting.
I saw the "coinbase" button with "add" (as opposed to "pay once") next to it, and jumped to conclusions. Sorry about that. I have no idea what Enjin is, so I probably should have just not posted. :) it looked like that screenshot was a merchant site or something, where you buy things.

I can't believe nobody beat me to answering this, because  has the feature you describe, including pegging the value to CAD. They call them "coupons".
You create them, print them, and they are denominated in whatever value you specify in local currency.
Just load up the account with enough bitcoins to cover them, and it just sends them bitcoins out of your wallet there right when people redeem them on the website. There is no password type of protection, so treat them like unencrypted paper wallets, don't let anyone even take a picture of them. Keep a little extra bitcoins in the wallet in case the price drops, or it might run dry. It lets you set an expiration date too, so you could set it for a reasonably short time and encourage people to redeem them as quick as possible.
The only problem I see is that you have to buy the bitcoins in the first place, so the Uni would be holding coin. The above solution only handles creating the vouchers that are redeemable for a fixed CAD value. :-/

I think its just general suspicion of someone wanting to give away FREE anything. If you see a popup for a free ipad, all of us know just to ignore those, so people might be wondering why you're doing it, and just have no way to conceive that you are not trying to sign them up for a scam. When you hear "free" anything, you can bet in most cases that means not really free at all, and it only looks free until you actually try to sign up. Its hard for people to tell the difference between a scam and Bitcoin.
I have a story that might be relevant, I picked up the game Elder Scrolls Online, and a week ago my subscription ran out, but I figured it might be fun to just stand in a busy area and yell that I'm giving away all of my gold. Well, it didn't go over well at all, I had people saying that I must be scamming, or got the gold by cheating and people shouldn't accept my gold. I found one person to take it, but after all the flames I learned the lesson to never do that again. It's like if you're generous, you are so rare that people don't believe it and assume you're out to fuck them.

I've heard people say that if there is a "flash crash", you could lose, but it hasn't happened since the gox days. I guess if the price dives faster than those defaulted positions can be sold, then there's no money to pay it back. Someone that knows more about this can correct me if I'm wrong.

Agreed. It does let you upload one of the keys though, I'm not sure how that works or if it addresses the problem of generating keys in a web browser and considering that secure somehow.

I wonder how long they will stand their ground against their customers.
I've gotten about 6 of those spammy requests, if I get more I'm going to have to just add a mail filter to remove emails from coinbase. Everytime I see those, I'm afraid I'm going to hit accept instead of reject, though luckily all the ones I've gotten are for millions of dollars. :)

It seems like a lot have a strategy of just selling the whole thing to a bigger company. I worked for a CDN that was sold to akamai, and they all saw that as a win, but I saw it as realizing they sucked and just cashing out.
But if they do want to make money, they are in an interesting position of being able to have promotions, where they allow companies that accept bitcoins to advertise or "spend from circle and get 1000 bits back".
If circle is successful at capturing the newbies, I don't think that revenue on bitcoin businesses would be shit. The conversions would be high, at least as long as bitcoin is only accepted in a few places.

LOL @ the other 2 responses that think oclvanitygen is a miner. oclvanitygen is a program for generating vanity addresses, like mine is 1Rattyf1yPnD8s87q6TiWey4UeQiRmtWE. It just brute forces until it finds the string you want, and the ocl version works with GPUs.
I don't know what the problem is though, -D 0:0 should work (capitol D). oclvanitygen can be a big pain to get working with AMD, you could try other versions of it, like this one: 
I'm on Windows, so this probably won't apply, but I had a lot of problems with the newer Catalyst drivers and had to use version 11. Though the symptoms were completely different, it detected the card, but would not print the private/public keys when it found a key. When you do get it working, I would test run it with an easy to find address just to make sure it won't run for hours and when it finds your key, only to print out garbage.

It is only an actual bait and switch if they continued advertising it long after the first $1000 was sold, and I don't see a sign of that. It is just a promotion, its up to the free market if it is worth going all the way to the mall just for it. I don't even see any signs of any of the stores there accepting Bitcoin, so I'm not sure what the point is. I'm after the promo ends, it will be like all the other Bitcoin ATMs and have a high spread like 10%, correct me if I'm wrong coinucopia.

To answer your question, someone will make a video of someone mining Bitcoin and title the video "This is what Dogecoin miners looked like", and it will be just as frustratingly inaccurate to those that were involved.
Those of us that were online in the 80s are shouting at our monitors, "That is Compuserve, not the Internet!".
The Internet was great because it took all these incompatible and separate networks and let them join together, hence the name Internet. What you see in the video is Compuserve, they had the whole AP newswire on there, and it cost like $25 (or maybe it was $30, I don't remember exactly) per hour to stay connected, so you would get good at getting on, saving everything, then get offline as quick as possible.

That was very interesting, the hash rate dropped by about half shortly after the dogecoin halving, and the value didn't go up. I speculate the hash just went to other coins, so after a Bitcoin halving, the hash might go to other SHA256 coins until those equalize, but I can't guess what it will stabilize at. There are several SHA256 multipools already, but BTC is usually the most profitable.

I appreciate you taking the time to write that, but I want you to know that I actually knew all of what you wrote. All of it.
You are assuming that anyone that isn't sold on Ripple must be ignorant, and if we could just see all the technical achievements, we'll just be able to put out of our minds the obvious showstopper that having 100% of the coins owned by a company is. Would it help show I actually know how Ripple works if I said "oil for the machine" instead of coins for the euphamism? When I say premine, I seem to get people that don't understand I use it as a jab at it, since any altcoin that started out with the developer owning all of it would be ran out of town, but instead the assumption is I just don't know. If I only knew, I would be on board!
So just know that just because we disagree on this, doesn't mean I'm just stupid or misinformed.
We just disagree that a company deciding who gets money is an acceptable cost of having the features. And profit isn't bad thing to want! But people shouldn't make money by owning all of the oil in the new money sending machine! That is just too corruptable to bear, the only system that is going to work is a trustless system, and that is what attracted a lot of us to Bitcoin in the first place. Otherwise we should just use fiat and paypal, since don't they deserve all of the power they have too?
Bitcoin isn't perfect either, but it's all relative. I notice the shortcomings of Bitcoin everytime I use Dogecoin with its 1 minute confirmation time and 1 doge fee (4% of a penny). Dogecoin is still from the same generation so its not going to be able to compete with newer coins, but I can use it without thinking I am going to make some company literally trillionaires. 
Its not as fast as Ripple, but I wasn't trying to say Ripple has no advantages, I just can't close my eyes and go along with the corruption. Again, what the founder did by irresponsibly selling all of his XRP should be an example of the risk you take by trusting people.
Oh and just a nitpick, but I'm not technically elite or wealthy, and I am mining bitcoins. I will take what you meant as that it is a huge hassle and risk, and well past the point where you can just run a program on your PC and anyone can do it, which I would agree with.

Wow, didn't expect such a big tip, thanks! The other suggestion I might have is pretty obvious, but it involves making it more complicated, and I think you have the right idea by keeping it super simple and not too busy. Things like having arcade game "attract mode" style screens that make suggestions on where to use the bitcoins, I bet a lot of people would be surprised to see how many places accept it now, even if most are online-only. So if that can be pulled off without losing the awesome simplicity that has been achieved, I would say add more info on the display. I usually complain about everything, but this exceeded my expectations, I can't believe it lets us buy bitcoins without having to jump through hoops.

Just saying something is not a problem does not make it not a problem. If someone has a slow wallet and can't get the transaction in the blockchain in time, it should not require human intervention at the merchant to manually refund the bitcoins. That is just a bad design, and the victim should not be blamed. That just leaves the customer with a bad experience, and hurts all of us that want to see bitcoin succeed.
Another option is to use Coinbase, they offer a similar service to bitpay, and can lock in the USD price at the time the bitcoins are received. 
So that is not perfect either, if it takes 30 minutes for the bitcoins to arrive, the price may have changed in that time. But it beats the heck out of having the merchant cancel the order, leaving your bitcoins in limbo.
An even better solution is just waiting for some smart person to figure out, but just saying something is not a problem does not make it so.

I'm not defending the approach, but I think the idea is it looks like a valid image file so it isn't as detectable? Then if some trojan scans for wallet.dat files that scans all filesfor the header bytes to find the file, it won't find it. I'm not convinced that's a big threat myself, I think simply renaming it is enough to hide it for most purposes.
I have my own techniques for backing up the private keys, since its only 52 hex characters per address, and there's all sorts of clever ways to hide that in plain sight. You can mix up the characters in a way you remember, apply ROT13 to it, and do whatever fun puzzly things you can think of, then paste it somewhere that doesnt make it stand out, like a random MD5SUMS.txt file with a filename next to it.

Except with BTC, everyone who mined it got to have some, with a very small amount for the creator. Compared with 10%  and that was distributed by whoever Ripple decided was worthy. The difference is by giving the Bitcoins to the people, instead of 90% for the company that made it, is more people believe in it and want it to succeed.
If you were stuck holding the bag on Ripple, I'm sorry, but you should have seen this coming. So few people shouldn't have so much wealth, we may as well stick to fiat if you think that is a good idea.

It says 1% fee on the website unless you pay for a plan. From what I can tell they are pretty comparable for fees, bitpay hits you with the 1% fee immediately when accepting the payment, but coinbase only hits you with the fee when you "sell". So if bitpay is adding a little spread on top of it, that is worth considering.

Just to help you learn, a wallet is just a collection of private keys, each of those private keys allows you spend coins that are stored in an address. All of this is in the blockchain, so no need to worry about losing coins, you can only lose the keys.
Use a site like  and paste in the addresses, then you can see what the world thinks you have for a balance if you ever have any doubt. You could even import your whole wallet.dat there and just do it all online.

The password was only for the launch, so everyone could start at the same time. Its just a normal download now.
It works the same any other altcoin, I'm not sure what is giving you trouble. If you're talking about their miner, you can just use cgminer like every other scrypt altcoin.

I've heard it said that the technology (concept of a blockchain) is here to stay no matter what, even if Bitcoin the currency dies.
I also subscribe to the idea it either is gonna reach critical mass and go mainstream or it will die. After enough years, I know I'll be tired of supporting Bitcoin and just say fuck it and sell all my bitcoins and continue using credit cards.
It doesn't seem likely to me Bitcoin will just survive without hope, and just be this lame thing that a small group of people use. I realize I can't predict that future, but that would be my bet.

Its such an easily refutable statement too. So is there any other currency that got its start by just being equal to another currency in value? When &lt;insert any currency&gt; was first being printed, was everyone always asking what it was worth in &lt;other currency&gt; and that led to it being successful?
Obviously not. All it takes for something to be perceived as money is for people to accept it as payment for something.

I see the points are already well discussed here about them already having a good model with being able to just automatically suck money out of people's credit cards, and that they probably won't want to just give that up.
They could tie in game currency to real money, like these guys will do: 
Or how about a blizzard altcoin that they create, so they can premine it, set it to PoW or something, then get it traded it on cryptsy. :) I have this vision in my head that mass adoption of crytpocurrency will happen by some greedy asshole company like Blizzard trying to just control the system, which would then get mass adoption, but if you can just trade it for other crytpocurrency, that would help us all by bringing a lot more people into our ecosystem, then people realize what a bad deal the blizzard coin is and would only use it to pay for things at blizzard.

For in-person trades I found it unnecessary, if i wanted to pay fees I would just use coinbase. For other kinds of trades, I can see it is useful and needed, but for in-person, it seems like you are breaking some kind of rule by not using escrow, since you can't leave any feedback about the trade.

It seems like the app wants you to close it as much as possible, or you'll run out of "energy" very quickly. That is kind of silly IMO, no app should encourage people to shut it off.

I totally agree with this.
Most of the benefits are for the merchant, the risk shifts to the consumer (just like cash) so we have to trust they won't just keep our bitcoins, and there's no fees (which the merchant normally is the only one to eat), so I'm not going to just pay at higher price just to "support bitcoin". I just hope the lack of response to "we take bitcoin" isn't take the wrong way when they just keep the transaction fee savings and lack of chargeback fraud, and yet offer zero incentives for the customer to take the burden of the risk.

I always wondered why people traded at gox, and no I don't think people that did are idiots.
I always figured it was about the trading volume, and you'd have to be a big player to understand.
It doesnt make sense to me though, why not use bitstamp, btc-e, kraken or any of the other exchanges that were operating before gox stopped bitcoin withdrawals? The fact the price was higher than all the other exchanges was a big red flag to me too.
I'm not being smug or sarcastic here, I am genuinely ignorant of why people would use gox after all the other exchanges came on the scene. In the early days, sure, but why would people be using them after lets say 3 months ago?

The post started out strong, and looked like it was going to explain how closing someone's bank account because they had a deposit or withdrawal could be explained by BSA, but didn't. I don't think there's a anti-bitcoin conspiracy going on either, but I haven't seen compelling evidence in either direction.
So are you suggesting that these bank customers that are having their accounts cancelled, are under investigation? They are supposed to report suspicious things, not just cleanly cancel accounts. I'm not saying you are wrong, but I haven't seen a coherent argument even put forth. Thanks for teaching me about the BSA, that was an interesting read.

I broke down and figured out p2p mining (not p2pool.org or any other centralized versions of it) at  because of the recent drama at Eligius. I used them until yesterday.
The pool owner accused someone of doing some dishonest stuff, so they let them mine for awhile but just blocked the payouts. The accused finally noticed they weren't getting payouts and started raising hell. Does that sound like a pool you want to support? They aren't supplying any evidence, I directly asked in the thread but so far no response. Mining is based on luck, so the burden of proof is on Eligius to give some stats on how they know they are guilty. What if that happened to you? I'm not going to find out if that happens to me. After this I am now on board with the idea that Bitcoin MUST be in a trustless environment, we can't just hope that pool operators won't pull bullshit like this on you because you have no recourse if they do.

I will accept unreliable sources like the daily mail or infowars, or even twitter, facebook, etc... I have just yet to see anyone even claiming they found a tiny device in their hardware. Common sense should tell you that if it was happening, you would see someone saying "I found one!" somewhere. Spare me the conspiracy theory bullshit, stick to presented evidence, then we can discuss that instead of just sitting in our chairs with our imaginations. Yes, evidence shows the NSA is spying on us, and that they are working with companies to make them assist in that, but I am just not seeing evidence little bugs being distributed on a massive scale.

I take back what I say about pocket change, if you're rich, hundreds of dollars will be pocket change so that is pointless to try arguing that. To me its a lot, but I understand its all relative.
I use one of these. 
All of them let you just point your miner with --scrypt option enabled at them, and they switch to whatever altcoin is most profitable and pays you in BTC directly.
As of a week ago profitability dropped a lot, it was averaging at about 0.015BTC per mhash per day (this is why I said last month, as this month is not looking as good). My main mining rig (I was only using that in that example) is 2ghash. Though now I pull in only 0.01BTC per day from that rig.
I pay 10 cents per kwh for power, and the power draw is 1150W (its 4 older cards, the newer ones like the R9s are lower power) so that costs me $82/mo.
I probably should keep all this secret, since the more people that know about all of this, the less profitable it is, but I don't like being selfish. At this point it would be risky to make a mining rig and expect to break even, but if you want to upgrade your GPU because the one you have isn't great, I say go buy a new R9 270 or something, and mine while you are sleeping and at work, if you can stand the extra noise. Then it will pay you back a portion of what you paid.
If you have a single R9 card, you can do about 700khash on 350W or so of power, and pull in $65/mo in BTC, and pay $25 in electric bill (which varies of course depending on where you live). Is $40 a month worth it? Maybe, maybe not. And its only going to get worse as more people keep up with all the tricks. There's other tricks to keep profits up, but they keep changing every week and its hard to keep up.

The ideal of Bitcoin is that it is designed as a trustless system, incentives aligned with selfish people. The 51% attack thing is a big flaw in that where incentives are not aligned. So when a pool is openly over 50% of the hash, what we have is no longer Bitcoin as designed, but just a single large company in charge of security, and your argument is that is ok as long as we can trust that entity? Just understand that a lot of us disagree with that, if we have to trust anyone, we may as well stick with fiat.

Butterfly Labs has a horrible reputation for taking preorders, and delivering them very late, long after there is any hope of recovering even most of the cost. Just google for them to see some of the stories, you'll find things like class action lawsuits against them, or when people had to do things like reverse the paypal payment (oh the irony!) to get their money back. They are just bad news and if someone wants to gamble on buying mining hardware, stay far away from them.

It is good for you to laugh, it can let out some of the stress you're feeling, if you owned any XRP. Just take a deep breath and let it out.
The reason we apply the premine label to it is because unlike most crytpocurrency, it is 100% controlled by a company. Does the term "mine" really throw you off so much that you can't understand what we mean? Those of us that say it are fully aware there is no mining with Ripple, we just apply the premine label to illustrate the problem. If a new altcoin comes out with 5% premine, it is doomed and called a scamcoin, so here comes Ripple with their coin, and saying they own all of it, and choose where to give it away.
The next argument I had to hear would be something about how its not a currency, but blahblah some bullshit about it being used to transport other currencies. Except for the fact that XRP has a traded value, and a market cap. Oh but they will graciously give away 10% of it, oh thank you master! Thanks but no thanks.
I am so glad it crashed, I only hope it just fades away quickly so we don't have to keep hearing about it. I'll take a more fairly distributed coin over a preowned one any day.

It will happen, but it won't be as much a conscious decision, but more something that will just happen.

Kind of off topic, Dogecoin is a seperate blockchain, so its more like Prodigy or AOL, before everyone got together and just used a single network.
But to your points, there is a much better tipping bot for bitcoins (it lets you have the private key for the wallet, is faster, etc..), but it doesn't get as much as use as dogecoin's. Also those of us into Bitcoins cringe at the "to the moon" thing that we've been saying in Bitcoin for years.
BUT there's something about the culture of new people that gravitated towards dogecoin that is really doing things right. I wish we could merge the maturity and development of bitcoin with the friendly community of dogecoin. In Bitcoin, the talk is about adding useful innovation, in dogecoin the focus is on spreading the word and marketing. For example nobody in Dogecoin is saying they want to add features to the protocol.
Here in bitcoin, if you post a meme or make a joke, you get people actually posting things like "bitcoin isn't a joke". So the rule with bitcoin is you're not allowed to have fun while participating in the revolution. I think its a big problem, and Dogecoin is going to continue kicking ass unless that changes.
I suspect part of it is Dogecoin is reliving the excitement of Bitcoin from the early days back when it was easier to mine, and there were less people, and nobody is telling people to be more serious or stop posting memes.

Its fascinating to watch, and bottom feeder exchanges like coinedup.com take on new coins a lot more readily, so being listed on exchanges won't be as much of a stamp of approval. Its like a bunch of factors make for a successful altcoin. They are all just so absurd, I'm happy to participate in mining and trade them for bitcoins, but I feel a little bad for suckers who are buying these.
Dogecoin is special in that is has a strong community that formed behind it, the group of people that would be into bitcoin, but are put off by "no meme posts" and other grumpy BS that is associated with the bitcoin community as a whole. So that was a niche that is now filled, and who knows if any of these other altcoins will find people that would rather use them than bitcoin. Maybe we'll be in a world where all of these altcoins will serve like flavors of money, and as long as people don't care that the value fluctuates like crazy, they can thrive.

I thought they were all hoping to get slightly below market price so they can just turn around and sell them on exchanges for a profit. If they do it slowly enough they won't affect the market price.
Now if the price ends up being at or over Bitstamp price or whatever, then I'm not sure what reason someone would have to bid on these. It has to be with the intention of profiting, its just a matter of figuring out how.

I live in the San Francisco bay area, and you would think people here care about Bitcoin, but nope! If I bring up coinmap.org, there's quite a few places listed, so of course I go checking them out.
One of them is a local optometrist, I didn't really need anything so I went for an eye exam. I went to pay in Bitcoin, and they said I was the first one (they started taking Bitcoin 6 months earlier), and they had to call someone to come over and figure out how. This was a month ago.
There's a local gold&amp;silver dealer that takes them, so being the Bitcoin fantatic that I am, I bought a coin (this was a few days ago). The guy said that "lots of people" have used Bitcoin, though the owner had to come down to handle it because none of his staff knew how, so that colored me a bit skeptical, though he might be telling the truth.
There's bitcoinstore.com on the map, that is very close. I emailed them (this was 6 months ago) and they said the only accept bitcoin on the website.
Nobody at work gives a shit about Bitcoin, except one guy that wanted to know if you could short it. I have a bitcoin bumper sticker and it has started exactly zero conversations.
There are bitcoin meetups in the area, so at least there's that. But merchants are still just really not getting it, even if coinmap makes this look like a bitcoin friendly area.
People that just "invest" in it like a stock, they are missing the point anyway. Those people are just trying to take advantage of a situation and could give a fuck less about Bitcoin, and are only here to profit. If you care about Bitcoin, go buy some shit!

I had the same thing happen to me a week ago, my transactions page looks just like that, all red. I haven't been able to buy anything since. I keep trying every few days. I'm replying to this comment to say I emailed support, and got a generic reply that I think means they accept it is a problem on their end, as opposed to my account being flagged as suspicious or something like that.








Based on that, I am guessing this isn't the issue where they need me to submit identification. For now, I'll just use localbitcoins. It would be nice if they had a ticket system I could just log into and check for status. I know they are supposedly new, but they have been in development for a very long time, but they had 9 million in funding a year ago. They couldn't afford to pay someone to setup a customer facing ticket system? I guess I should keep emailing them every 3 days to see if it's fixed? Or try doing a small deposit once in awhile.

Unfortunately, Circle can bad too.
After only a few small buys (under $500), suddenly transactions would fail. They had this red X icon in the transaction list. It would just say "status: failed. please contact support". So I contacted support, and they said there was a problem and they were looking into it. After a week I emailed them again asking what is going on, then I get a reply saying I need to submit a scan of my driver's license or other ID, as well as a copy of a recent utility bill. It's not like I have a choice, coinbase is just as bad, so I complied like a good sheep.

It's a bit cringey seeing someone compare decentralized cash to a centralized payment network. People can lose cash in a fire too. It isn't fair to compare Bitcoin to something completely owned and corrupt, credit cards offer a large staff of anti-fraud and support, paid for my merchants for outrageous fees. Bitcoin only offers people the freedom to be responsible or not, having Bitcoin means you are a bank. If you are likely to screw it up and lose your bitcoins, do yourself a favor and use something like coinbase and enable 2FA, or any of the new sites like it coming out like circle.

It doesn't matter how honest the individuals are, when you mine in a pool, you are giving complete control of your hash to the pool operator. Any sane pool operator would probably not do anything bad (but I could be wrong) because it would ruin their pool, and harm Bitcoin's reputation.  But it is a powder keg waiting for some hacker to get in there and do a doublespend which would damage the reputation of Bitcoin.
There are some solutions being worked on, so I'm not worried, but pretending a problem doesn't exist is not wise.
Examples of solutions:
p2pool: Not perfect, but at least you are generating the blocks, so even if you are pool mining, nobody can commandeer your hashes for evil.
Then there's [getblocktemplate]( which is a neat way to still do normal pool mining, but in a way where it is like p2pool where you are generating the blocks yourself, removing the risk of some hacker taking over a pool's hash rate.

@_date: 2014-06-03 04:22:39
I worked at an ISP in 95 and YES it was as hard to explain as explaining Bitcoin now. For those of us that experienced it, the analogy really hits home.
Even when trying to explain it to people that used online services was hard. AOL was the dominant online service at the time, before them was Compuserve. AOL just kicked their ass on price, (a mere $5/hour for service, so people used them. Many companies had "AOL keyword" sites, you'd hit control-K then type in a word and you could get to their sites, but those companies wouldn't have a website.
The way all online services would work was you would run their app, and it would dial up to them and give you a menu, and everything worked like that. On that menu would be everything that online service had, it was obviously proprietary, and no way to get from one service to another, except email. And emailing to another service through proprietary gateways would charge you per email.
Meanwhile, at the ISP, customers would follow the directions we gave them, and get connected, then they would assume it didn't work because the dialer window went away. At that point you were on the internet.
Can you guess what the  most common question was? "Where is the internet menu?". A lot of people cancelled and went back to AOL after hearing there wasn't a complete menu of everything on the internet.
It makes you laugh at that now, but back then people seriously understood the internet that poorly. To you and I, we think FREEDOM, but to newbies, they just want everything handed to them.
To bring this to Bitcoin, we have the same problem. When you try to explain that you have real freedom, and can be your own bank if you want to, they don't care or know why they should care. But they pay attention to is "the Bitcoin CEO was arrested". They think in terms of it being owned by a company. Whenever someone says decentralized while explaining it, they NEED to stop and explain what that means.
I think the  thing people should say to new people about Bitcoin is that nobody owns it. That is what makes it more compelling than just  some random dot com that made a new product and is trying to sell you fake money.

Hi, thanks for the thoughtful reply.
The point about XRP not intended to be used as a currency is understood by all yet it keeps being repeated. I need to come up with a better metaphor than "oil for the machine" since it is obviously ineffective, or maybe it is just a bad one but nobody will point that out to me? If it is stupid and innacurate please tell me so I can stop looking stupid. Just stop repeating "XRP is not a coin". We know.
The point I keep making is that the creators of the system have created an asset that they wholly own. Compare that with most cryptocurrencies that have a "fair launch" so that everyone can be a stakeholder. YES I KNOW THAT XRP IS NOT A COIN, in case you were going to point that out, I just had to say that real quick, sorry for the caps. :) The only response I get is that it is no big deal, and we should just accept it because the fees aren't that bad, even though a single entity got to decide on their own who gets that?
Ok I think I know a way to put it, hopefully this helps. What attracted a lot of us to Bitcoin and got us obsessed with it is finally we have something we can just be stakeholders in. It is the people's money. When I first got into it, you could GPU mine, then steadily it got harder and harder to join, and that is a shame! But that is inevitable in a free market, the pros squeeze out all the amateurs. Even as bad as it is now, you CAN just join in and mine, it might not be worth it to but you CAN. Did I make a point or no? Satoshi didn't engineer a separate currency for fees that he created all of.


Who gets that $1 ? Instead of having a system where anyone can just participate, the divine creators of the tech get to decide that. This fundamental difference is why I lothe Ripple.

The one part I'd like to see cleared up is that whole part about him trying to get someone "hit" like he was some kind of mobster. Remember when that was in the news? There was a really specific story told about that, then they just dropped it from the charges against him. WTF was that? We can all just conclude it was all bullshit, but I would love to see someone sue those assholes for fabricating that bullshit and smearing him.
Or on the other side, maybe they fucked up the evidence for that, or plea bargained it (give us the BTC and we'll drop that part of the charges, how else did they get all those Bitcoin?). I'm not saying he tried to order a hit, and for whatever reason they aren't charging him with that, but I haven't found enough evidence either way! Was there any statement from the prosecution about why they didn't charge him with anything about the attempted murder?
I stopped watching after 5 minutes, it was just his poor mom saying he was an angel, giving character witness and telling all these irrelevant stories about what a sweet little angel he is, with a sigh at the end of each line as if to say "Here is examples of him being kind, therefore he couldn't do crime, how can you morons not see such an obvious thing?".  If she actually had any relevant facts about what actually DID happen, lets see some links to timecodes, you'll have my thanks!

I do the same thing, and this might not help since everyone is different, but I deal with it by keeping my gambling in "investing". Some of it is so risky it is like gambling, but you get to influence the outcome, and its less a "tax on people bad at math". I'm not kidding myself, its risky as hell so I'll gladly call it "gambling", but here's what I've been trying. This is only a short example, I do a whole lot more than this, but these examples illustrate a fail and a win..
 - I already lost some though on someone with an A+ rating, so fuck that site. I'm sure fans of it will refute that and say the strategy is to invest in a bunch of different loans so the ones that default can be covered by other ones, but losing 1/5 of my investment isn't going to be made up by 5% returns on the others. :)
So after losing that, I moved onto the next thing:
 - investing in "total return swaps". It is almost a sure thing, I have $1000 in that and I get $1.20 a day in interest for example. Not as exciting, but I use that as my lower risk bet, while I invest in riskier things to see what pays off.
Then I won't bother going into the obvious ones like investing in various altcoins, and trying to learn all about what ones might go up in value, but there is that too. Most go down in value, since most are shitcoins, but sometimes they go up, like Blackcoin.
So the idea is, when you fail, just try to learn from it and keep at it. Just keep your investment amounts low for practice until you get better at it.
So if only instant gratification can satisfy you, or putting in the time to learn about the stuff is just not an option, then that won't help. You don't need a ton of bitcoins to play with for these either, but obviously the winnings will be less. But if you can convert your desire to gamble into investing, that an improvement right? I get a thrill when I see my investments pay off and I see those bitcoins coming at me, so it works for me at least. I'm still learning myself, and if I'm wrong, I'm sure I'll get replies telling me that. :)
@_date: 2014-07-15 02:18:05


then in the next line, you explain that if they do use their hashing power to do a doublespend, everyone will leave. So which is it, do they not control it 100% (at least if they're not using getblocktemplate), or do they?
For a real world example, I am more afraid of some hacker getting into ghash and doing malicious things than the pool operator.
I think the best idea is to just come up with and spread good ideas on how to fix this, instead of just dismissing it out of hand when someone points out flaws. There are solutions, (I don't like repeating myself, see my first post) they just need to become popular.

I thank you for bringing up this issue in a calm and rational way. However what is always omitted by defenders of Mtgox is how they blamed a minor exploit on all their problems. That would be like an email provider that was  doing nothing about spammers blaming SMTP for the fact they had an open relay, years after most providers already locked things down. Then after they announced that to the world
 Yes there was a tx malleability problem, but they tried to play it off like it was all the fault of the Bitcoin protocol, and we all should agree that was bullshit, given that they still are not allowing withdrawals. Their actions have caused unfair damage to Bitcoin, and that sleezy action is hard to forgive. I was neutral on gox before this, but after they just said it was all Bitcoin's fault, I grabbed a pitchfork. The Bitcoin ecosystem will be better off without them.

Interesting. I never say "pre mine" because people like you think opponents of Ripple don't understand how it works, but yet you STILL act like I did. As if opponents of Ripple just don't understand, and if they did they would love it. It is 100% PRE OWNED by the developers. Yes I realize XRP is not exactly the same as BTC where it is the currency, but it you need to obtain it before you can use the network, so I keep saying it is the "oil for the machine". Did you even read any of what I wrote? If you want to debate my points, that is fine, but for fuck's sake, read what your opponents are actually writing. XRP was completely owned by the developers, and we are supposed to trust them to distribute it. Their own website says they have only given away 10% 
By contrast, Satoshi premined Bitcoin 14 blocks (700BTC). So compare that with the 100% ownership of XRP. In order to be a fan of Ripple, you have to not let that bother you, and you shouldn't act surprised when most of us say no thanks. Again, I know XRP is not the currency, but you have to get it to use the ripple network, and you can exchange it for Bitcoin on exchanges. It has a market cap, it is not something you should just ignore, or justify by saying the developers worked really hard and are entitled to it. If there wasn't an alternative to Ripple, we might have to accept it, but since there are more fair ways of distributing money after it is printed, we should just use one of those. I love Bitcoin and most altcoins, I just don't like any of the obviously corrupt ones that just serve to make the inventors of it rich.
If I am wrong, please submit some facts, I would rather be proven wrong than continue to be wrong, but everytime I debate Ripple proponents, they keep with the same points about that XRP is not like BTC and it is just used to enable sending of other currencies, and that there is no mining so you can't say "premine", but apparently I can even change my wording and you guys don't even change your response.

Can't blame them for trying, entrepreneurs being entrepreneurs, but this is just another attack vector to intercept someone's Bitcoins.

It's like reading one of those "How many Bitcoins do you have?" threads, and watching in horror as a lot of people answer.
I can keep going, now lets say something like this actually gets popular, now you HAVE TO get an address before someone snatches up your name (think of how Twitter/Youtube/whatever is, except with a direct line to phishing people with a method to donate to them instead of you).

Delete option  when people default, they don't give anyone the borrower's info so you have no chance of getting your money back. I spread my loans among 5 borrows evenly, all A+ rating people, and one of them turned out to be a scammer.
And even the author says  is bad, so I'll skip that.
And add "total return swaps" at Bitfinex, the big risk there is if there is a huge flash crash in the Bitcoin value, but otherwise, its pretty safe. The interest rate varies, a month ago it was 0.1%, but now its around 0.04% a DAY. At today's rate, if you put in 1000, you'd get $12.90 in interest after 30 days. The borrower has to have collateral in the form of Bitcoin, and it just automatically sells to cover it. Compare with btcjam where the borrow has to do a really good job of making a profile, and can't even put up any collateral in any kind of escrow, even if they wanted to. Yes I'm comparing different things, but I am contrasting them from the investor's point of view that is comparing different options.

Speculation aside, we can look at real examples of it in the field, and see the advantages and disadvantages of it with real examples.
The older PoS coins like ppc and nxt were done by the devs starting out with all the coins, and we're supposed to trust them to distribute it fairly. But newer ones like Blackcoin were PoW for a period of time to give out all the coins, then switch to PoS.

One thing I figured out about Bitminter a few days ago, they add zero fee transactions into the blocks they mine. So when I send coins between wallets and put 0 fee (blockchain.info makes it easy with custom send), it will stay unconfirmed until Bitminter solves a block. I love them for this.

I agree, that was a bullshit move. They already have a bad rep with Bitcoiners, this only makes it worse. I had hoped they would communicate something by now about the obvious problem of claiming to give away free money if you can sign up, then not being able to sign up. I mean nobody owes anyone anything, but its kind of bad karma to just try to trick people like that.
I see a lot of "check your privilege" type posts, with people reading your statements as if you said "I was ripped off". But after rereading the post, I don't see that anywhere.

It might be a definition issue. When you say "charge backs" people think of credit cards, and how you can just cry to the bank and they will just rob the merchant of the payment, and leave them having to fight you over it. It is a bane of doing business on the internet with shady countries.
If you mean literally doing a refund of a transaction, that is something else.
It's a good thing to not have that ability so you can't be ripped off. Once someone gets your money, that's it, you can't fraud them and just take it back. If they need to refund you, they can just do another transaction and send you the funds.
Maybe there's a new market waiting to be created here. Sort of like what the credit cards do, where the merchant gets the money, but only sort of, the bank can still take back the money. A company would have to have a lot of capitol to do it, but it would sure beat using credit cards. Maybe someone like bitpay could offer that, and the merchant can offer "buyer protection" and have an edge on their competition.

I was just going to post that, I would also add most exchanges are also off-chain too, and you would only see it on the chain when the coins are withdrawn from the exchange, or the exchange puts them in cold storage.

It is still a new thing, and they have a lot more work to do. For example there's no web interface to just browse it from your desktop. And how secure is the ratings? You could probably fake good ratings by making lots of addresses and trading with yourself, and I don't see any way to just browse the history. The fact it is ONLY accessible from your phone is a real problem. I'm sure they're going to make it awesome later.

There is no argument presented here, and an attempt to shift the burden onto me. No, I don't need to do more homework, you need to refute any of the facts presented. If you had corrections to make on how I am presenting that it works, you or any of the other Ripple fans I have had conversations with would have presented them already.
All you have presented are justification for my criticisms. All I get is that I am right, but if I just alter my perception, I can see these aspects of Ripple as a good thing.


Again, you assume that the only people opposed to Ripple do not understand it. That is your mistake.
Thank you for responding though, it is making me get better at this. I used to say premined, since conceptually it is like other altcoins that start out with a central entity owning them all, but rather than get the point, my opponents just used that to make it seem as if I didn't know there was no mining in Ripple. Even though opponents will ignore that I chose my words carefully, everyone watching caught the straw man attempt. And now I know not to say scamcoin, saying that only hurts my argument because there is no way to prove it, and you are able to debate that instead of the actual facts. Rather than push the conclusion, I just need to stick to the facts. You would think the fact of the price taking a dive after one of the founders sold all of his coins would have shown the flaw in that design, but nope.
Even if you think that is a good idea, it isn't like these people are even going to give them away. They are treating it like a stock, where the founders just outright keep them. Of course they are holding them now, they were hoping they would go up in value then they could just sell them and get extremely rich. Even NXT had a more fair distribution. 
And say that mining being costly to do it profitably now is kind of a weak argument when comparing it to a 100% owned coin. I still mine, I barely break even but at least I can do it. I don't have to wait until the creators decide to sell their holdings. You're comparing a p2p network where anyone can join, so the pros just take over to a system where it is pre-owned. I'll take an open market over a closed one any day. You have to compare things to each other, so understand that is just looks silly when you compare a flaw in something with something that doesn't even have the ability at all.

Just pointing out the obvious, but Bitcoins and physical coins only have the name in common. We all laughed at the TSA agent that saw Bitcoins in someone's bag, right?
Money that you can teleport irreversibly and pseudoanonymously is a much powerful and harder to control thing than a slug of metal.
I agree the Bitlicense thing is bad, and frankely impossible to obey and enforce, but I think making a point about policy for collector coins being less regulated than Bitcoins will just give our opponents something to rip apart.

@_date: 2014-06-03 04:37:58
Just a minor correction, the big guys all had their own networks, and way later they just decided to use the internet. They didn't care about the internet until they had to use it. It was just too good and compelling not to use, and that describes Bitcoin pretty well.
As for regular people, it was inevitable it would get popular, but it was a fight. I would often have to hear "its just easier to call" even when a store had an online store. As time goes on the benefits become more obvious to people, but for a long time we have to hear them argue "why not do it the old way? Its just easier".
People get hung up on how shitty something is at the moment, and can't understand that those problems can be worked out. Example:

I couldn't figure out how to activate NFC.
@_date: 2014-09-12 02:11:33
Yep it's called Google Wallet. Just look for any POS terminal that has tap to pay (the mastercard one, not "visa paywave") and you can tap your android's NFC to it to pay. It uses mastercard's system, but you can use your visa with it without it showing up like a cash advance and still get rewards, or you can use a debit card or bank transfers. The holdup is merchants adding terminals, so now that Apple has "invented" it like they invented mp3 players, we can all pretend this is new and hopefully we'll see more terminals popping up. "This is actually a good thing!". :)

You're confusing what someone can do with what as a society we will agree to. In an open market where Ripple competes with other cryptos, I just have to hope that people choose to not buy into the preowned one when they can choose more fairly distributed coins instead. Bitcoin isn't perfect either, Satoshi owns a lot, and it is distributed based on who can waste the most electricty. I'd love to see a coin in the far future that gives a coin to each person on the planet, maybe a hash of our genome. But since that is just sci-fi, the next best thing is mined coins. PoW is ok, and PoS is an interesting approach too. But what would be a huge step back is just 100% owned by the inventors. Why do people even defend that? We all get to vote with our dollars and we can influence people by talking about it. We are all free to decide what ideas we like, stop with the rhetoric about freedom when nobody is attacking it.
I'm not stuck on Bitcoin, I love all cryptos that aren't premined/preowned, most of them have something new to offer. I just hope the market decides what wins and not a government.

That old 2013 bug only affected signing, not private key generation.
So you wouldn't even have to generate new addresses if you were affected according to that article, and comments on page 2 of the forum thread you linked.
But if it was me, I would just generate new addresses and move those bitcoins anyway. Its like making a new password, no reason not to do it. If it was possible to somehow make new addresses on blockchain.info that were hackable, that would be pretty big news.

That is a pretty site, but people should realize this isn't new. It might be better or worse, that is up for discussion, but so many comments are like "OMG this is an amazing new idea, kudos for thinking of it!".
I've been using this other one for a few months, leaving wallet.dat files with "sloppy wallets" on the 3 computers I use, as well as my paper wallets, then setting up sms alerts in case my sloppy wallets get stolen, or god forbid my paper wallets.
This is where I first heard the sloppy wallet idea: 
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:13:09


This, a thousand times this. The only thing that can get lost is the transaction, so the only 2 things that can happen are:
1. The transaction gets included in a block, then your bits are in the new address.
2. The transaction does not get included in a block, your bits are right where they were before you tried to send them!
The transaction might hang around for awhile, but it will either get posted, or not, there is no way for your Bitcoins to get lost in transit. Please spread the word, you worried for nothing. Now, if you sent it to a paper wallet and immediately lost the private key, that is another story.

I didn't think to try tracking them down in company listings. My guess is they are a coin dealer, like those places that buy/sell gold &amp; silver, but there is no sign of them online, no website that I can find. If I get bored enough I'll make the 20 minute drive just to see, but the lack of digital footprint of Coinage makes me feel like a stalker if I just showed up. If I can find a phone number of email address, I'll reach out to them that way first. If I do visit, I'll be sure to post the results.

Come on, you know its not that simple. Most people don't know what bitcoin is and they would get a lot of people clicking it without knowing what it is, then they open support tickets. They don't feel like hiring more people to keep up with all the stupid questions that would flood in. If they were committed to helping Bitcoin they would, but they are not, so they won't.
Or they might make the mistake of using bitpay instead of coinbase, and have to deal with all the people that fail the 15 minute time window, adding even more support burden.

I am open to learning, but I am still not seeing how escrow helps someone in real life not rob you. If you pull out cash to pay for bitcoins, the other person can grab it and run. If you are the seller, you could confirm and release the bitcoins from escrow, then the other person can just snatch the cash back and do whatever violence is necessary to you to not pay you the cash and keep the bitcoins you just released from escrow. I'm just failing to see how escrow helps safety in a real life exchange, so I'm happy to save the escrow fees and just wait for some confirmations, and exchange the cash, and assume the unavoidable and minor risk that they rob me. I'm just saying that either way there is a risk, and escrow will not help that.
Online trades, where the person deposits in a bank account, is of course a completely different story, and that is a big part of localbitcoins. So I am not saying the escrow service is useless, I just fail to see the benefit with in person trading.

I can only speak for myself, but being tipped 10 cents worth of bitcoins is what got me into it back in November. So if we get a bunch of new people (assuming they aren't scumbags pretending to be new), I think we should tip them to get them hooked.


I totally agree with that. But tipping in crypto subreddits is more likely to be appreciated. Whenever I tip outside of crypto subreddits I feel like I'm handing out bibles. It has to be done though.

We need to educate people that there is nothing official about Bitcoin. The closest thing we have is the original client that people use as a reference, and the documented protocol.

I consider it a fun onramp to cryptos, with sites like cryptsy you can just trade them out for bitcoin, which is a good thing for all of us right?
To those of you that weren't into Dogecoin since day 1, it is self promoting, we got into it because we like to have fun at the same time as participating in cryptocurrency. I heard about the price manupulation stuff, which made the price jump from 50 to 200, which is sad, but that is irrelevant to its popularity, since most of the traction occured before that. Just be careful with the "hyperactive agency detection", everything that happens doesn't have to happen because people or a group of people marketed something. I'm pretty sure nobody is saying that about Bitcoin.
Once you get people out of fiat, they can just move their now frictionless value into other more useful coins, so I don't see altcoins as a big threat, most mainstream companies are only going to bother with bitcoin no matter what anyway.

Also any solutions would probably remove whatever privacy we have left, like having a global ID card, and that number gets a one time payment of a new cryptocurrency.

The whole malleability dos attacks didn't start until after Gox halted withdrawals.
I looked at a few exchanges, lets see how long it took them to impliment a solution to this vulnerability.
Bitstamp: Feb 11 - Feb 15 (manual withdrawals were working sooner than that)
BTC-e: Feb 10 - Feb 11
Blockchain.info: unaffected (not an exchange, but just an example of a big site that moves bitcoins that knew about the 2 year old bug).
Mtgox: Feb 7 - still suspended. It was supposed to be working as of today or yesterday, right? I can't find any announcements on their website saying withdrawals work if they are. But even before Feb 7, can you remember how long it has been since you can easily get money out of gox? Their little stunt unfairly caused a lot of damage to the reputation of Bitcoin, and my original comment was venting at the fact that they STILL have not learned from that, and are still pretending this bug is the reason they are holding everyone's bitcoins hostage. It is not reasonable to have taken this long.
I would apologize for being mean, but at this point anyone that is defending Gox has got to be a shill, so I'm not even posting this for your benefit, but others that might not have done a few google searches to figure out the truth. 
Everyone, please just let them die so other more competent exchanges can take care of their customers. It was always embarrassing having to tell new people to ignore the gox price because it was inflated over every exchange, and now we have to tell people that Bitcoin did not crash and they should ignore the current Gox price. It all just made us all look stupid. If they can just finally die, we'll all be better off.

I was there 2 hours ago, and everything was as advertised. I bought $100 and I was still within the first $1000. It's not too late if anyone else was thinking of going. I really like this a lot better than robocoin, but you can't withdraw cash, but perhaps that keeps them from having to violate your privacy.
Surprisingly, there is no public wifi that worked in that area of the mall, so I just used my data plan to use my phone's bitcoin wallet, no biggie. The connection the ATM uses must have been solid, it worked flawlessly.
My only complaint was that these ATMs should be near a shop that takes bitcoin payment, then it makes sense to be there. Even if a single shop accepted it, there could be a little sign on the ATM saying "spend your bitcoins at ____". I don't even care what kind of shop, I would have gladly purchased something with the bitcoins just for the experience. I realize ATM manufacturers aren't responsible for merchant adoption, but that is my feedback.
While I was standing near it, I saw a group of 3 people curiously peek at it and one of them says "Bitcoin is $300". Maybe the screen should say something like "minimum purchase $___", to make it clear to newbies that you don't have to buy whole bitcoins. Not that that dude would have plunked down money to buy bitcoins that aren't accepted by merchants in the mall, but still. :)
I also slapped another $20 onto a paper wallet and made a quick one-handed video of it. The video came out really really shitty, I wish I had someone with me that could have recorded it. I should delete it, but why do that when I can upload it to youtube instead? :)

I'm in the south bay, and I pretty much hit all nearby shops that take bitcoin if I'm even remotely in the market for whatever they have to sell, and make a point to buy something.
But are any of these new? I remember seeing Ocean Blue Sushi Club on coinmap.org forever. And we can't exactly go buy stuff from a dotcom incubator. :)

Ahh yes, give into your confidence. If I believed I had a personal relationship with the creator of the universe I'd be arrogant too. Those that opt-out of believing what we were told as children will just continue only accepting what we can be convinced of with logic, and be willing to correct our knowledge when it is proven wrong. You can point to any evil organization and point to a few token good things they do in the name of the bullshit, that doesn't make worshiping a fairy tale any less insane.

I think they are just saying that people shouldn't assume they are accepting the liability of keeping your coins safe, so if you or they get hacked, you can lose it. I can imagine being them and being paranoid about someone using abcd1234 as a password, getting hacked, then suing them, and demanding "trial by jury or to participate in a class action.".
I'm not saying they can't make a better TOS, but in the sue happy world we live in, I can understand why they made the effort to protect themselves. I don't think an EULA like that would stand up in court anyway, but that's another topic.

You can buy XRP for BTC right? I'm not going to argue about definitions, but conceptually there is a digital store of value called XRP that was 100% owned by a company. Most of us can see it for what it is, and I'm sorry for the people that fell for it.

Thanks for posting this, this inspired me to get off my ass and figure out how to backup my codes. I went and redid all my codes. Google is the best and gives you one time use backup codes that you can use to recover it, then you just keep that somewhere safe. Bitfinex prints the code that you can write down. Circle doesn't help at all, so I used a generic barcode scanner app when setting up google auth with them. I just wrote down the code that appears. It will decode into something like otpauth://totp/Circle?secret=ABCDEFG12345. Write that down the secret part and keep it in a secure (preferably offline) place, then you can enter that code by hand into google authenticator. It sure beats having to risk not being able to access your stuff, and having to prove you are the account owner on sites that don't have your personal info, like bitfinex or blockchain.

It looks like nice little app there, but its adding a risk of being hacked without enough of a benefit to justify it.

There's a big difference between an exchange going insolvent, and the protocol being exploited.

If you mean ipominer, yes they payout in whatever random altcoin of the week that is being mined, so its more raw and wild west. If you want a simple and reliable payout of the 0.06BTC per day per mhash that most pools are giving, use one of those. I think of ipominer like a semi-automatic way of mining risky coins, I plan on just transferring everything I mine directly to whatever exchanges take them and cashing out asap. If it ends up being too much hassle I'll just fall back to coinshift.com or one of the many multipools that pay out in BTC. I've only been at it for a day and its been double the normal profit, but maybe the next day will be half, I'm still taking it one day at a time.

It sounds like you assuming 1 address = 1 person, and/or that everyone keeps their bitcoins in a single address?. Also, due to "Change Address", anyone using the default client will have their coins scattered into many addresses everytime they send any.
And finally, if someone keeps a lot of bitcoins on an exchange or web wallet like coinbase.com (the wisdom of doing that is another subject), their coins would be scattered over many addresses as well.

I was the one being talked about, I put what I thought was the equivalent of saying into a phone "terrorism" to see if the NSA is listening. I put "terrorism and drugs" in the coinbase.com private comments, and coinbase saw that as risk of me being a terrorist, and rather than call the FBI, they closed my account. Or perhaps they think drug dealers are putting the word "drugs" in the comments? I never got a visit from law enforcement, but I would have been happy if they did so I could have cleared my name off any watch lists.

I'm in that category too, though I'm not as upset as you sound. I don't mind the speculators, miners and political activists, but I just really like having a money that is mine. The only way anyone can take it is to convince or torture me into giving it to them.
It is a bit depressing to look at the price vs USD as if it is a stock price, but until we get enough volume where whales buying and selling don't cause huge price changes, it is hard to just want to keep a balance of bitcoins lying around forever right now. I look forward to the day I can realistically choose to just use it instead of USD. USD can be like a fax machine, that annoying protocol you have to use when dealing with old institutions like banks and legal, but anyone with a clue will just let you fill out online forms instead of doing paper forms that you scan.
I think when we win and crytpocurrency is just mainstream, we will know because it will be boring. It should be a non event just buying something with Bitcoins, as boring as it is to pay with paypal. I look forward to it.

Andreas Antonopoulos is awesome, but that rogan podcast annoyed me a bit. He needs to stop giving people the impression the "bitcoins are on your computer".

Finally someone is sticking to making fact claims instead of insults, thank you for that. I would like to ask for more info on how Ripple has little to do with XRP. My understanding is they created all of it, and gave away 10%. How could they give anything away unless they owned all of it?

Reality isn't that black and white. Using multisig is only a single tool that an organization that does security well can use to do it better.


It makes it more secure because if a single key is comprimised, they won't lose their coins. It only helps, and is a sign of an exchange that takes it seriously. Just using multisig doesn't automatically make an operation more secure, but it is a sign of one that is. Again, spare me the black and white thinking, good security is about layers.

They are just very dedicated to making it work everywhere, so go order from anywhere you want, and a human being will process it if it isn't supported, and they are pretty quick about it. That is how it was when I ordered something a month ago anyway.
Don't bother logging into the merchant site and adding your items to your shopping cart with the merchant, snapcard uses a bookmarklet to select the items and add them to a special cart at snapcard. Then the merchant only knows your shipping address and never knows your credit card, its pretty awesome.

I think the point being made here is that after all this time, they should actually notify people that are suspended as to the reason. It's just a criticism of their customer service, and I think it is a valid point.
I had a similar problem, except it didn't even say suspended, but every transaction would fail, it let me try but they all failed. I contacted support, they replied right away saying there was some problem and they are looking into it, then a week later (not exaggerating) they replied saying I needed to send a copy of my ID and a recent utility bill. They never told me what flagged me, I only sent coins to my own wallet, and from there to other exchanges. I sent the documents in like a good boy, and a few days later I was up and running. It's just bad customer service is all, it's a free market so I think its just good to share stories like this so people can make better decisions about what service to use. If people still want to use circle, that is cool, but they should make sure not to assume it will be there for you, or that they will act professional and tell you why you are suspended when the MSB rules say they have to suspend you. Or is there some MSB rule that says they are not permitted to notify people?
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:18:54
I suppose they don't do this for legal reasons, but technically nobody is buying or selling anything, they are exchanging. Do you buy Euros with USD? When the 2 things involved are a currency, that is called an exchange. Bitstamp is not a Bitcoin store where you buy bitcoins.
But I guess if it is legally being considered a virtual beanie baby, they have to use words like buy and sell.
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:20:33
One annoying thing is if you simply meet the person in person and send the person bitcoins, and take cash, you can't leave any kind of rating about the person. You have to use their escrow service to do it "right". So keep in mind the rating system is not terribly useful because of that.
You're better off using a service like coinbase, unless for whatever reason you can't use them, but its always more expensive to use localbitcoins.

No it doesn't, the problem they're talking about is where coinbase.com delays broadcasting the transaction. Sometimes it is nearly instant, but not always. I think they buffer up a bunch of transactions to be more efficient. But if the transaction isn't even broadcast to the network, it is not even at 0 confirmations, and that is a real problem for using it as a spending wallet.

That sounds pretty amazing, I'll be sure to give them a try.
They will be taking on a lot of fraud risk if there are no delays in doing ACH transfers, they must just plan on absorbing it all?
It might be a ploy to just steal marketshare from coinbase, they'll just burn through money with the huge amount of fraud, and hope coinbase runs out of money first. Then it really is like the internet when it was new, last company to run out of money wins! :) I guess it's a win for us.

Well, think about it, if you send them money, they already have to show you an address to send to, and can already verify if money is sent to it.
And for a custom app, I guess you could import a private key into it (display the private key on your phone, and let them scan it), but that would be incredibly insecure.
It could just be their own app like you say, or I think more likely its just a gift card kind of thing they might do. Then you could opt to have the gift card in the app and not have to carry the card around. I'm not sure how this is at all secure though.

It isn't wise to keep a big balance of Bitcoin on coinbase. If they added a paper wallet option (let you enter in the addresses and it would watch the value of those in fiat), then it might actually be useful.

That is weird, were you withdrawing cash (as opposed to making a money order)? I've withdrawn sums of cash from Wells Fargo (here in San Jose, California), amounts like $3000 and $2000 before, and the teller seemed to go out of their way not to talk about the money. They would make small talk, and even I was thinking they must be a little curious and want to ask, but they didn't. I left after the 2nd time thinking it had to be some rule that they should not ask. But after your story, I am learning towards there isn't a policy and they are just making small talk. IMO it would be great if there was a policy where they shouldn't ask. It is none of their business, and I'm sure if you could do whatever you were doing without dealing with a person you would. The ATMs limit can really get in the way for those times when you need to buy gold or bitcoins.
It is kind of funny that now days if you use cash for something, it just feels like you're doing something bad.

I'm a fan of Coinbase, but their response to the egg on their face has been really shameful. First they tried ignoring that guy, then he goes public, then some hackers started exploiting it to prove their point. And what is their response STILL? That they will not fix it, it is not a bug, and it is part of core functionality.
I expected them to give us some option to not be query-able by now, even if I change the real name field to something bogus, now everyone can know that "someone at this email address probably has some bitcoins". Hackers can just focus their attacks on those email addresses , since they know those people have stores of money that can be stolen without chargebacks.
It is not comparable to facebook, dropbox, etc.. because THEY ARE STORING MONEY. If a bank let hackers just massivly query an API to get our real names from Bank of America, you can bet there would be a shitstorm, and the response would not be that it is not a bug.
I started out loving Coinbase, since they are the only game in town for US residence to buy Bitcoins without paying $20 for wire transfers. But this latest move shows that security is not the top priority for them, and even after being pubically shamed, they won't even acknowledge that revealing information about what is essentially bank customers is a problem. I'll still use them to buy bitcoins, but I need to keep a zero balance as much as possible.
@_date: 2014-05-24 02:21:51
The mining aspect you bring up is interesting and worth some study. These cryptocurrency creators have to figure out how to do a fair distribution, but without getting free money being the only thing anyone cares about. At first Bitcoin was fair, but now that it is unattainable without specialized hardware, now the focus is on using it as a payment network and currency. I'm not saying the perfect solution has been found, but it sure as hell isn't Ripple. In the marketplace of ideas, the one that says "I'll own all of it, and give it away fairly" is the worst of them all. Fiat should have shown us that humans can't be trusted with that power, or they'll mess it up. Example of messing it up: one of the owners selling all of their currency and making the price dump. :) That kind of thing should just not be possible, if Satoshi sold all of his coins, that is like 10%.
All of the other features and uses for Ripple become irrelevant when it is so corrupt at the foundation.

It's not perfect, they wouldn't even have to hide what is happening, just "now sending to 1Pwned234kvkf", and there is no way to reverse it. Vault would make it harder, but they just have to suppress the notifications and hope you don't notice the pending transfer until it's too late.
And for multisig wallets, such as greenaddresss or bitgo, your password is one of the keys. Then if your browser is infected, they just have to wait until you type in that pass phrase and they can just login as you and simply spend everything. Or am I mistaken?
Even paper wallets could be compromised when you go to spend them. There's just lots of ways to steal, and people should do what is best for them. If someone knows they are not good at security, they will reach out to a company they think is.

All of that will work fine, the only thing a wallet is, is a bunch of private keys that authorize you to spend the coins in each address. Just keep those private keys safe and you won't lose any coins.

It will be interesting to look at this in the future to see if anyone correctly guessed what it will be. We can already make some good guesses, like currency, colored coins, etc.. But there has got to be something that doesn't exist yet that will just make it explode, like HTTP did for the internet. Before HTTP we were using FTP, Gopher, IRC and stuff like that, none of those were going to make the internet blow up like it did until HTTP and HTML came along.
Or maybe Bitcoin is already "good enough" and it just needs some mainstream adopter like Amazon to give it an air of legitimacy to the public.

If they can't trade bitcoins for fiat so they can pay bills, it is understandable. I'm in a similar situation to that guy, and wire transferring USD is what my Ukraine friends want. I read threads like this to see if there's a service that operates anywhere near Simferopol that will exchange Bitcoin for fiat, but so far there is none.

I think they are different,  address there is 599 Fairchild Dr.
I went looking for the one at Coinage LLC, there is no sign of the company at the address in the business listing. 
I can't find any kind of website on them either. I clicked that link you posted, it has the address as 206 Casto street, and Bitcoinference was at 444, so maybe that is really it? A news article said it would be moved "down the street" so that makes more sense that it is on Castro street. Anyone have any info on what Coinage actually is or what they do for a business? Do they have any kind of website or even twitter/facebook/ANYTHING ? I can only assume they are a gold/silver dealer, but I have no idea.

The way I see it, Bitcoin just makes middlemen optional. While you and I prefer to be our own bitcoin bank, a lot of people will prefer to pay for a service to protect them.
If Bitcoin really starts dominating the world, I can see paypal adding value without being an unwanted middleman. Perhaps they can launch an escrow service. Newbies can keep the coins on places that don't let them have their private keys, as long as they are choosing to. I love Bitcoin because we don't NEED middlemen, as long as it is optional, I'm totally ok with them for people that want them.

Just to be clear, we're talking about real p2pool, and not p2pool.org or any other pool that is part of it, where you just point your miners at them.
p2pool is decentralized, so you have to run a full bitcoin node/wallet to take part. That is because your node decides what to put into the block on its own. Compare that with a normal pool like ghash, where they completely control what it is you're mining.
If someone can even theorize on how to subvert p2pool to do a doublespend, that is news to me, and I would love to read about it.

Back in June I charged my electric car at some random guy's house on plugshare.com, and I asked him how much and he said no charge unless I kept coming back often. I was able to bring up Bitcoin, since he was asking me what I was into, and he seemed interested since he was a Libertarian and liked the idea. I thanked him with a paper wallet with $5 on it, he seemed thankful, but I can never tell if they're just being polite.
I keep checking the address and he hasn't spent them.
The whole thing made me feel like I gave out a bible as a gift, like it wasn't really wanted. I don't know if he threw it away or just stuffed it in a folder.
I tell that rambling story to say, maybe we need to do more than just give the wallet, maybe we need paper wallets with links to sites that they can import the wallets to, and spend them. Is there any good wallet designs out there with newbie help on them?
I worked for an ISP in the early 90s and the  question support got was "Where is the internet menu?". They were coming from AOL, where they gave you a menu, so people were put off by having all that freedom just shoved on them. Our stock answer to that question was yahoo.com (this was years before google).
So the next part of that, we need a bitcoin menu, just a nice simple site that you can point people to. Bitcoin.org is horribly out of date, just click on exchanges to see what I mean, circle.com isn't listed, and coinbase really should be the first option. If people have to do a bank wire to send/recieve bitcoins, that is just a big pile of fail.

Oceans 11. They could break into a big faraday cage with paper wallets, and have to smuggle the keys out somehow without getting caught.

When I first heard about Bitcoin I thought it was stupid, because it proposes a system that gives the initial coins on whoever has access to CPU cycles. Now days it is even worse with it evolving to GPU -&gt; FPGA -&gt; ASIC. I thought it would be better if we could have a system of cryptocurrency that would give each person the initial coins, perhaps everyone is born with coins, perhaps if your genome is used to make your private key? But all of that is just science fiction, so for now PoW/PoS/whatever is a more practical solution.
So my point is, if we had the ability to somehow give everyone on earth some kind of cap&amp;trade credits, why not think bigger and give everyone something more general? Lets face it, we don't have the technology to something like that anyway, but if we're dreaming, lets dream big. :)
Update: For those that seem to not understand, I am not making an actual proposal, what I am suggesting is impossible now. Picking it apart would be stupid since I did not dress it up as a thing we could actually do. I even said it has many problems and is sci-fi, but apparently I need to directly state it. Or will I continue getting criticisms of it as if I was saying it was possible to do?

In case any newbies are thinking of trying this, it works by sending the winnings to the same address that you used to send, so it will not work if you use a web wallet that doesn't give you private keys like coinbase or circle. If you need to use a web wallet, blockchain.info will work fine.

Well of course if you're a fucking moron and pitch it like that, it is a bad sales pitch. Instead you can point them to coinbase.com and bitpay.com and show them they can use Bitcoin as a great payment protocol, and not take on any risk of price fluctuations. And both of those options have been around since at least last year, long before that shit article was written.
Then it goes on to make a point that we should just hold Bitcoins instead of trying to help promote being able to actually use Bitcoin as it was intended. It's not even worth dismantling the argument, it is just so stupid.

I agree with that, but the inverse is true too... When the Dogecoin car was in NASCAR, one of the announcers said they raised $55,000 to sponsor the car, the other asks "How much is that in dogecoin?", the reply was 67 million. Then he says "I've made investments like that", implying it was worthless.
So if you're right, then Bitcoin will stay the serious business coin, and Dogecoin will be for tipping and sending small amounts. Doge is technically better for that anyway because of the 1 minute block times and the fee is usually 1 doge ($0.0004). I always prefer to pay for things in doge if they take it, since it confirms so damn fast.

If BIOS's are really having code put into them, or physical bugs inserted into them, there should be some case of it being found. If it is being found, then I want to know too so I can look into protecting myself.

You have to take into account that a community is made up of different people, what is old and overused for you, can be brand new to others.

So while you are sick of it because you've already seen all of this 100 times, it is still new to the new people. If is going to be serious business only, so be it, there is need for seriousness too.

I think the more appropriate metaphor for this are "checks" instead of "currency". They are claim checks on bitcoins, and until the recipient sends the coins to another address, the sender can sweep the coins out and invalidate the printed notes. Also if there is no internet connection, the recipient has to just trust there are coins in the addresses, which is more like a check.
I really like where this is going, this could be really handy.

There are many many rideshare companies, Uber is the most centralized so it's not a good example. [Sidecar]( is my favorite since it is more of a marketplace that lets drivers and riders meet, and it uses a reputation system. It would be hard to make it completely decentralized since you need to have it so people can build up reputation, and the owners of the system can police it for cheaters. I'm not saying it would be impossible, so I hope someone tries to start a decentralized ride sharing thing and see if they can overcome the challenges.

Lets use web wallets for an example. If you're on coinbase, you can put an email address for the recipient and if that email is registered on a coinbase account already, it sends it to them, if not it will send them an email with directions on how to accept the coins.
For blockchain.info you can also send to email, and SMS as well, where it just sends the person info on how to accept it.
Why not just skip the risk of using a middleman and put your bitcoin address on your homepage/blog/facebook/twitter profile? Then you're trusting that your (whatever) account doesn't get hacked, instead of some new site with no reputation.

I like the idea of coming up with ideas, bring them on!
Assuming that is possible, I think that will lead to more private pools, where they just all go into it knowing the risk. High variance will be a nightmare for smaller operations, so it would be worth it to private pool. I can just see the rise of private pools, where you have to be vetted before you can join, to make sure you can be trusted.
Or worse, it will squeeze out those smaller operations, since if some rich person owns a mining facility, they already trust themselves so they won't be affected. But some idiot like me with a 180GH antminer S1 will either have to just turn off my miner, or find a private pool somewhere that I can convince to trust me, but that is unlikely.

We just have differing opinions, while you see rich kids, I see people that feel so strongly about something that they are willing to sacrifice something valuable. Its not quite as powerful as self immolation, but close. I'm sure they didn't purchase their Apple hardware knowing that Apple would become an enemy of Bitcoin, but now that they have, they are making a statement. It is not like these people are buying iphones so they can smash them, this is just a more public way of switching platforms. It is just a shame that so many people don't get it, and think they are rich or something. Giving the phone away or selling it just makes another iphone user, and is kind of helping the problem. I hope the next move is to give free android phones to people if they buy bitcoins or something.

The worst is when defenders point out there is no mining, therefore it is technically not premined, as if somehow we didn't know this. Or that we just don't know how Ripple works and if we did we would all love it. It takes a special kind of person to like Ripple, one that doesn't mind a company owning 100% of the oil to run a money transmitting machine. Normally when a company creates something, it should be rewarded, but something like creating a money transmitter is just too important to let the inventors abuse their power and just own all of it at the start. Ripple is supposed to be used to transmit other currencies, but defenders of it forget that you require XRP for that to work, which has great value, yet pointing this out doesn't shut them up.
So to any defenders of Ripple out there, when someone says 100% premine, interpret that as "100% preowned of the enabling currency". We don't mean literally premine, nor are we stupid and don't understand XRP is not supposed to be currency, we just reject your proposal of allowing a company to just own all of the required component used to sending currency in that network.

How about a link to a source about the story of the Napoleon banquet so we can go verify it? Those of us that have an interest in verifying stories are true before repeating them as fact need sources. Links to sources are appreciated, it saves us the trouble of googling. Lack of interest in verifying sources results in believing things like vaccines cause Autism and that climate change isn't happening because it's cold outside.
I googled around and most places that quote the story refer to this book  so I can't trace their source without buying the book, whether it is from a writing or just a legend. 
I have no doubt that Aluminum was more valuable than gold, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence for that. 
Also, the asteroid thing is easily debunked because of how gold is formed, I see another comment did so I'll stop there. A better speculation of the future is that it will becomes cheaper to create gold than it is now.
Here, I'll show you what I mean by giving sources:  BAM! Source'd! See how much more compelling it is and how much less like bullshit it feels? While wikipedia is never an actual source, it summarizes other sources that we can all falsify.
So they can already make gold now, the only problem is that its really expensive to create tiny amounts.

It would just be trivial to bypass, with blockchain.info YOU are in control of your private keys. That means you can just import those into a normal wallet and spend them.
If you want something like a service to limit your spending without trusting a service like coinbase.com to be solvent, try one of the services that uses multisig.
There are 3 keys made, and you need 2 of 3 to send bitcoins, and they get one, and you get 2. You're supposed to keep one of them offline so that if the service goes down, you can still get to your coins.

Yes, it is dumb that I have to say it, but when you dismiss the problems as not problems, I'm not sure what else I could say? I should be like most people and just give up, but for some reason I have a bad habit of trying to reason with people no matter what they say. I really need to quit. I'll just say this one more time and if you don't get it, I'll simply give up, when you mine at a pool, they 100% control your hashing power, they give the blocks to your miner to work on. Any "if" or "until" statements are applied after that fact, they 100% control if or until whatever random thing you keep coming up with. Pool mining is just a big risk right now, someone could hack ghash and abuse the network, which would send people into a panic. It just has to happen once to freak everyone out. I think Bitcoin would survive, but the risk is avoidable, so instead of saying its not a problem, why not help me spread known solutions and even better, help come up with new ones?

They could choose to invest the money for support and development, but they would have to really want it. They are geeks there, so I hope they do want to dive in. But it is just a bit infuriating when people act like its just a matter of adding a button. Someone else brought up the point of available payment processors for Sweden, can they use something like bitpay to minimize risk? Or the legal status of using Bitcoin as a payment method in that country? Don't answer that, I am only giving that as an example of things they would have to learn. For those of us that are into cryptocurrency we already know much of this, but for people that don't care about Bitcoin, it is a harder sell. They have to want it. If your next reply is going to be more oversimplifying of things, then you can have the last word.

If someone loses a wallet password, that has a more reasonable level of entropy and could be cracked, and even in a short time if the person can remember what it the password was sort of like.

I was there at launch, when they released the password for the zip file and ran it immediately, and it was on block 2000. Also the devs admitted it in IRC. 
I mined this in case an exchange actually takes it and people are dumb enough to buy them, I did it with catcoin and ronpaulcoin and made 3x more than I would mining other altcoins, so why not with a stupid hyped coin like Coinye.
But premine is the least of the problems with this coin. Dogecoin did well because of the friendly community that made it just fun to mine and give away. They wanted to see their little doggy get to the moon and enjoy the ride. But Coinye is like its namesake, only greedy fucks that want to pump and dump it.

I can say that the journey into Bitcoin and other cryptos have made me question what money and currency are, and after learning I went and bought some gold and silver bullion with my bitcoins, diversifying my investment a bit. I was always a saver, but now less of it evaporates from inflation.

Or just do step 1 of that, sending your bitcoins to another address you own, but put "drugs, nuclear missiles, chemical weapons, and ISIS donations" for the comment, and they will take care of closing the account for you automatically. :)
edit: (in case its not obvious by the smiley, I'm kidding, nobody do this. They watch everything, and assume you are for reals no matter what extreme lengths you take to exaggerate to show you are not serious. Even though nobody is buying nuclear missiles with coinbase, the banking rules say they have to cancel you)

Focus less on get rich quick, and more on its use as a payment network. The whole scam side will only last so long, what makes Bitcoin so exciting is it that you can be your own bank, it is digital cash. I die a little inside everytime I hear people say things like that guy did at the start of that interview, it is seen as a trick to make money, those people are missing the point completely. So please, don't encourage those people, buy Bitcoin so you can buy things with it.

It needs to be greater than the transaction fees. I got into bitcoin when someone tipped me 50 cents worth. It was enough for me to send it to a wallet, and make it feel real. If people just have unspendable bits in a wallet on changetip, it won't have a happy ending.
@_date: 2014-04-26 05:00:49
I'm not saying this is a great solution, but if the recipient happens to use coinbase also, you can enter an email address instead of the bitcoin address.

I did that early on just to try it. You end up using paypal, because for some reason paypal doesn't mind Lindens but hates Bitcoin. Then you have to by Lindens (SLL) with USD, then you exchange SLL for BTC.
I ended up paying 22% (don't be a sucker, factor in the spread!) more than if I just used coinbase though, virwox is just not worth it as a bitcoin exchange.

I don't think it, but I sure do hope! Fingers crossed! I evenly love most altcoins, they all have their pros and cons, but Ripple is just such an obvious centralized preowned scam.

No matter what other arguments people have, there is no getting past the corruption.

Laymen is used to describe someone not in a specific trade, such as if you were an biologist trying to explain something technical, it is hard to do without stopping and explaining a bunch of chemistry. I agree it is hard to explain Bitcoin, it took me awhile to fully get it, and I only bothered because I really love it and invested the time. There's just a bunch of new concepts to get before you can really understand it. Like that guy that posted that their spend didn't go through and they were terrified that they lost the coins, it just shows that we're not doing a great job teaching.
I hope you're not a troll (seeing words like parrot and smug thrown around really looks like you're not the type that tries understanding things, but resorts to insults right away instead) that just sunk up my time in trying to explain this, if you are, consider yourself successful.

Just adding this as another alternative, but coinbase.com lets you set a name, and that locks it to you also.

I'm not saying I have evidence that they are not "routinely" bugging network devices, but if they were, wouldn't we be seeing lots of news about it with photos of the implanted bugs? I would be interested to see what they look like, and where they hide it, so I can go taking a peek inside the chassis of the routers at work. :)

I'm not going to criticize the production value, but the lies and exaggerations just piss me off.

I can let them look at it in their hands while I rattle off "this is the public key, anyone can see how much bitcoin is in there, and you can deposit to it with that, but in order to SPEND them you have to uncover this side here with the private key. this was made by a computer that never touched the internet after being reinstalled" and impress them if they're a geek.

Not for Americans buying things in America. I sent some bitcoins to a friend in the UK and it was a lot cheaper than paying for currency conversion. When I bought things from overstock and newegg, it was about the same convenience. But for buying gold from amagimetals, it was a few percent cheaper, since the merchant didn't have to worry about fraud. The risk falls on me to make sure the merchant is legit, so that is a mark against it. What the Bitcoin space needs is a good escrow service for buyer protection that merchants can offer, then we'll at least be on par with credit cards as far as convenience, and ahead of them on security. It might make people ask, why bother changing anything if we're back to having to trust people, the difference is that it is more like SMTP email than a single ISP's mail system, you have a choice on who to use and no central authority has to tell you what trust provider to use.
If merchants can give a few percent off, and basically pass through the cost savings compared to credit cards or paypal, it is more worth using. I used joinsnapcard.com to buy a few things, but they charge extra, so it kind of kills the excitement to not only lose out on the cash back rewards my credit card gives, but have to pay extra on top of that.
Back on topic, someone saying "no demand for bitcoins" is one of those people that only bought into it for a speculative asset and is already missing the point of bitcoins. They weren't made so people can treat them like beanie babies.

This style works as long as it is other people being made fun of. Someone reading the directions you would think "oh that is for those OTHER people, but I am smart!". So making fun of bitcoin users won't hurt them at all, since most people reading that won't be bitcoin users and will just laugh.

Its a very old trick, anyone that's been into bitcoin for a long time has seen many sites like this. Most of the time they're not even ponzi and nobody gets any money back ever.
Watch for things like a "Who we are?" page that doesn't actually answer that question.
I like the EV SSL certificate, those must be easy to get now.
Kind of off topic, but to show how common this was, you can find a ponzi right now from bitcoin.org. Click on get started -&gt; find an exchange -&gt; USA -&gt; rbitco.in

You replied to my comments about Ripple, calling me out on saying premined when I never said that. I'm not going to just leave that unchallenged unless it looked like you were just intentionally misquoting me to troll and get a reaction. It seemed like you legitimately thought I throught that XRP was mined, so I figured I could explain that those of us that hope Ripple dies actually have studied it. Then you could go away at least with some respect for people you disagree with. 


Please don't quote me out of context, that is just a straw man tactic and you should try to stay above that. I did not say it was a closed protocol, if you read it in context I am talking about the method of obtaining it. Mined coins are naturally distributed, where as Ripple is 90% owned by the company still, and much of that is directly owned by the founders with no pretense of them having to give it away. I just continue to try to keep this about facts, but then you keep calling me emotional or butthurt, I'm not angry at all, but then you end it with an insult. I'm still not angry, but just disapointed. It has no bearing on if it succeeds or not, but I like to test my conclusions on people to make sure I have my facts right just so I know what is going on for myself.

I had the same thought when seeing that jar, but I can think of many reasons why they would not want to do it.
They have an option to pay to paypal, with an extra fee of course, so they would be losing out on those kickbacks if they offered Bitcoin.
They would have to educate people on wtf bitcoin is and how to use it. I can picture the tech support nightmare as people try it out because its on the menu, then start asking cashiers how to use it. Allowing that in a store might imply that Bitcoins are accepted in the store. So if they have to have huge blinking disclaimers about that, it would kind of kill the point of doing it. Things like Bitcoin ATMs make sense when located in a shop that accepts Bitcoin, but Coinstar is just all over the place.
Now this part I don't know, did they already have to apply for a money transmitter license? If not, there could be legal issues. Just giving change for the same fiat you put in is probably easier to do legally.
And finally, what would be in it for Coinstar? Do they even have competition? I have never seen a change machine that was not coinstar.

I wish I could hit a button to filter out all the results from people pretending there is no problem. That is not how solutions are found.
If both parties are in the US, both can just get an account at coinbase or circle, and pay the small bank fees. circle doesn't charge for the bank transfer, but they make up for that by hiding the fee in the spread (their price per bitcoin is higher than normal), while circle charges 1%, their price is normal, so they're pretty much the same. So in an example of someone in the US sending bitcoins to someone else in the US, that's like 2% for the whole thing. Though they may as well use paypal or dwolla in that case and not pay any fees. :)
But let's talk about outside the US, and international payments, I assume that is what most of us think of with WU anyway. I guess the answer is we just have to wait until more bitcoin remittance companies or exchanges with low fees start up? I'm not sure what else can be improved.

Interesting outlook. So we should stop talking about it? Is that what you're suggesting? The more people talk about it, the more people might decide to get an android for their next phone. It is not reasonable to just say it is ok since you can just root your phone, we're not all geeks that are comfortable with doing that.

All this plugin does is act like a Bitcoin address book, making it easier to /msg your address to someone, with a bonus feature of being able to display the QR code of those addresses. It would be hard for them to justify banning this one.

I tried to look up what countries circle.com is available in, and couldn't find it. This was the best I could find:
From reading that, I assume it is the fact they take credit cards that makes them so global? I can't tell which bank systems (IBAN, Swift, etc..) they accept, there is just no documentation on circle.com at all about this.
Meanwhile trolls reply with "you must be American" when people ask why not use Coinbase, as if this is documented.

Science is humans doing the best we can to understand the universe. If you can come up with a better way of trying to figure out what is actually going on, I will consider using it if it is better.
Carbon gas traps heat, do I really need to site sources on high school level science? There are fun experiments you can do at home to show it. Also we are adding carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at a high level whether you choose to believe it or not. Climate change deniers are only getting in the way of actually trying to keep earth habitable by humans.

You are sure making a lot of assumptions, I think many altcoins have interesting features and are good for the crypto economy. Almost all altcoins were a fork of Bitcoin, so it's only fair if Bitcoin can "cherry pick" features.
It's a little bit sad that you read what I wrote and took some kind of anti-altcoin message from it, what the actual fuck? Read the fucking text, it is suggesting we use faster block confirmation times, and I was citing Litecoin as a real world example where it has been proven to have worked on a large scale just fine for years.

Yes yes yes absolutely yes. I do not treat it like a stock, and the Bitcoin price is a stock price, I love it as a payment network. I have very little Bitcoin, just enough to buy things online. Uncorrupting the money system will allow many of the worlds other problems to be fixed.

Yeah coinbase isn't a big problem since only developers would even hear the real term, and only miners (or pool administrators) can even make a coinbase. I was just giving an example of another company name that is an unmodified technical term.
Blockchain.info was a block explorer before it was a wallet, so it at least made sense as a name in 2011/2012. I can't fault them for evolving their offering without picking a new name, but at this point I think a name change would be really awesome of them to do. I think it would boost their street cred if they did.

Rather than make insults, why not make a point instead?


Ignoring the insults, I interpret that as saying inflation is not a tax. If a person chooses to save up for something, the value of that is undeniably eroding as they save. Newly created currency is like cleverly transferring money from every dollar in existence. Is that not tax-like?


Ok, so it is a tax then? Pick a point and stick with it. If all you have are insults and contradict yourself in 2 sentances, you should probably re-examine your conclusions.

This is really great, but it implies Bitcoin is only for poor people. Also it buys into the fallicy that spending more gets you more. Like if you hear someone say "you can't afford an iPhone", implying that everyone wants one, but we're only choosing the more open platform of Android because we're poor. Bitcoin is for everyone.
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:22:53
That is like saying it is still ridiculously difficult to learn math. It is only difficult when you don't know how to do it.
Lets use the author's example and look at buying them with coinbase. They have to deal with a lot of fraud, so they limit unverified accounts with that big delay. But if you verify, you get to use the "instant buy" option.
So yes it needs to be easier, but that is because it is having to interface with a corrupt system, and when it catches on, converting bitcoin to fiat won't even be necessary.
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:13:58
If anything stupid like this catches on, I can see services cropping up where you swap bitcoins with other people, maybe by trading the private keys, so you can buy "clean" bitcoins and use them on whatever site buys into the bullshit. Then the other person just takes your tainted ones, and spends them on sites that are more sane and believe bitcoin needs to stay fungible if it is going to compete with cash.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:32:35
You could just give the links to blockchain.info for each address you used to take payments, that details the amounts and time/date of each transaction. That can be correlated with your sales ledger.
It is not really "proof" though. But I am not sure they need that.
The accounting challenges are a good argument to use a payment processor like coinbase or bitpay. They both have reporting. But then you're back to using a centralized keeper of your bitcoins. :(
Another random thing that may or may not help, while viewing an address on blockchain.info, click on the little popdown thing next to "filter", then export history, then you can save it out in .csv so you can bring it into a spreadsheet if you want.

Making death threats crosses a line.

I've been through that, and it took a few days to confirm. I heard that it will eventually time out if it doesn't get confirmed. When it happened to me I tried hacking my wallet with pywallet to make it think I still had the bitcoins, then I spent them to another address with a fee this time, but then blockchain detected that as a doublespend, but it went through.
When I posted about it on bitcoin talk, some people gave horror stories if it staying stuck for weeks, I don't know if that still happens.

Yep, but the listings are nearly identical to coinmap. I see at least one example of them being less accurate than coinmap, they list memory dealers even though they don't take bitcoin in-store.

I have seen that video, and that is what made me wonder where all the evidence was. They also only go over the Snowden documents, and I'm unable to find them presenting something new, such as "Someone found this bug in some equipment". The pictures were from the Snowden leaked docs. If it was there and I missed it, I would actually thank anyone that would point to it.
I think I see the confusion. Please don't interpret my comments as me saying "the technology does not exist", or even that the NSA isn't massivly spying on everyone. That would be stupid and is obviously wrong. What I am saying is, the accusation is the NSA is putting this technology everywhere, so I am saying if it is everywhere, someone needs to present one that they have actually found. We just need one case of like "AT&amp;T employee found this tiny bug in one of their routers", or even just a normal person found one in a laptop. Most of the spying the NSA was doing was with the cooperation of other companies, so there wasn't a need to have little transmitting bugs in devices.

We have a lot of work ahead of us before we get mainstream adoption. If people like Glenn Beck and Alex Jones are in my camp, it makes me wonder if I'm on the wrong side.

I wonder if it might be for the better if they do use something like coinbase, think about people that just click email attachments and install toolbars, I wouldn't want those people keeping private keys on their desktops. Just make sure they setup 2FA on coinbase and they are decently protected, probably more than their desktop wallet.

I wish people would stop downvoting posts because they disagree with them. Instead why not refute things with facts so we can all see answers to things, in case they come up again.
Back to this, I can see where the confusion is coming in. They call them "Bitcoin ATM", but that is misleading. More accurately it is like a currency exchange, like at the mall or airport. And those guys take a HUGE cut, 12% for euro to USD at Travelex (they're at the local mall here).
Bitcoin does not shine when people treat it like Ripple, where someone just buys bitcoins, spends them right away, and the merchant converts back to fiat immediately. What was the point of even doing that, if people hate bitcoin so much, they should just use fiat.
I think you have a great point about it turning off new people, if they google "bitcoin price" from their phone and see how much of a spread there really is. The business model must be more like a check cashing place, where no sane person would pay that much, unless they HAD to for other reasons, such as "off the grid". And that only even works for Lamassu types of BTMs, I don't know why anyone would use a Robocoin and pay that spread. At circle.com you can get $500 worth of bitcoin instantly. At changetip you can buy $25 and also get access to the bitcoin instantly as well. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:19:25

I went to one in San Jose a few days ago, I was going to drop $1000 on it if the fee was like 5%. But it was 14.5%, so I had to walk away. I wonder who uses these things? Most people on localbitcoins in this area are under 7%, and you get to deal with a person that can help you setup your wallet if you have questions. The fees these ATMs charge would make sense if there was a market for people that like to pay retail for the service level of wholesale.

Careful with BTCJam, I lent to 5 people, all A+ rating, and only 3 paid back. Their answer to that is you're supposed to lend to a lot more than 5, like 50. There is no recourse for when people default, it is no surprise at all that so many people scam there, if I had no morals I would be scamming people there right now.
You can try gyft for gift cards. I bought one for Burger King, and the app just shows the gift card number, and they're supposed to take that. I tried to redeem it, but the person at the register said they could only take physical cards. So I'm stuck with a $10 burger king card that won't even work. Maybe I am just unlucky? I hope you have better luck!
I hope that we get more people like us actually getting out there and using Bitcoin to buy things instead of just HODL and "smauging", it is like voting with money.

Alright, I take back my statement that coinmap is more accurate, I think they are around the same. I was just refuting the assumption that airbitz is more accurate because they verify listings. If they wanted to do it right, they would contact (even email would be fine) the shops and let them know how to manage their own listing. Or even an "report mistake" button so the public can help.
Something like this will always have inaccuracies, so its best for people call ahead to check on shops before visiting anyway. For now, I just check both sites every once in awhile to see if anyone new is listed nearby.

Yeah, there should be another section for those. If being able to store bitcoins is the only criteria, then they should list all the exchanges too.

I'm curious what excuse they literally gave. Maybe they need to be able to trace all money used for the down payment? I remember when I was getting my mortgage, they gave me shit about $1000 my mother gave me, and wanted her bank account number so they could verify she got that money legitimately. I refused, but it was ok if I showed I wasn't using it for the down payment.
So I am wondering if it was literally because you're buying/selling bitcoins, or was it just that from their perspective, you're making income from an unregulated source? For all they know, you sold drugs on silk road for bitcoins, and sold the bitcoins to coinbase. I'm not saying that's fair, I'm just trying to make sense of this.

According to the ledger in my BFX token account, these are the redemptions:
* 2016-Sep-01 1.1812%
* 2016-Sep-30 1.3152%
* 2016-Nov-02 1.5%
* 2016-Dec-05 1.75%
* 2017-Jan-10 2%
* 2017-Feb-03 4.6%
* 2017-Mar-06 5%
1.1812+1.3152+1.5+1.75+2+4.6+5 = 17.34%
As lame as this is, they keep applying that percentage to what remains. So when they just paid off that 5% on March 6, it is 5% of how many BFX tokens I had at that moment, not 5% of the initial amount of BFX tokens that existed at the start.
If I look at how many BFX tokens I have I got when they were issued, vs what I have today, I have been paid back **16.5%**
TL;DR They've paid back customers 16.5% of the funds.

The problem was that apparently you couldn't even modify it at all with Breadwallet, like you can with other wallets. So if the user decides that it's really important their transaction is in the next block, they can make that choice themselves. It's all well and good for a wallet app to make these decisions by default, but it won't let me override it, I'll use a wallet that does.

It is a pretty mind blowing revelation. Charlie Shrem gave a talk at a local bitcoin meetup a few weeks ago, and he said while he was in prison, they used cans of mackerel fish as currency.

I'm curious where the 60% traffic loss figure came from? Trade volumes are still as high as ever, is there some publically accessable web traffic stats that are showing a loss?
More interesting is their users lost 36%, and they've been paying it back very slowly, 5% since the hack so far. I'm not saying everything is ok, but it's a damn sight better than Cryptsy. Trade volumes recovered too.
Cryptsy pulled a Gox, but Bitfinex handled things very differently.

That's interesting about the web traffic stats, if that's accurate. I'm puzzled as to how their trade volumes are back up, if web traffic is down. It's been about $5M USD per day earlier in the year, then had a spike in the summer, but it's still at the $5M level.
Maybe that much of trading is done with bots so web traffic is unaffected?

Name, address, phone number. The main use-case for things like Localbitcoins is anonymity, at least I thought. If you don't care about privacy, why not use circle or coinbase? If you do enough transactions at circle for example, you can buy up to $500 and get access to the bitcoins instantly. And the fees with those guys is about 1%.

Careful what you wish for, the bank could scan that and cancel your account if they think its anything bad. For example if you put "drugs" in the memo when you buy medications. Then again, I've only seen coinbase do this, I put a stupid joke in the memo field and got banned. I've put my usual offcolor jokes in the memo fields of paper checks before and never gotten in trouble. I'd be fearful putting of putting anything on an electronic memo field on a bank app if the someone at the bank is reading those and judging me.

I've used them a bunch of times, it is a bit of a pain if the qpay vendor is dumb, but once you find a place that understands how to use libertyx on their qpay system, it's pretty painless. I had to go to 3 places before I found someone that knew how to do it.

They could use an escrow company to have the borrower put up their car or other property.

I'm just speculating, but btc-e is the other exchange that I know of that doesn't verify customer identity at all, so if all that BTC just flowed into btc-e, that might explain the price drop on that exchange. btc-e hasn't ever (that I know of) accepted USD wires from US citizens ( so they're not vulnerable to the bank attacks that Bitifinex and OKcoin are suffering from anyway. It's not really fair to say btc-e has problems with something they chose to not support.

The reason the price is high is because people can't get their USD out, so people are buying BTC just so they can move it out. The Bitfinex price just needs to be ignored as the source of any valuation that BTC has in general, it's just the price of possibly nonexistant USD from Bitfinex.

I never get comments like this. The OP is sharing information so that the rest of us can be aware of how a company does things. It is posting a warning so anyone thinking of using Kraken can know they have to send unwatermarked docs.
Sharing information like this puts pressure on the company to change, or if it's an unreasonable request, it will get ignored. It is a good thing in a capitalistic society to share information so the rest of us can know.
Posting the equivalent of "stop whining" isn't helping anyone. Obviously we all know and agree that nobody has a "right" to use a service, but spreading information is healthy. If you even read the original post, they were just sharing the information, and were asking for alternatives, literally nobody is claiming a right to do anything.

I lost money too, the docs said they recommended spreading the investments (this was before any auto lending), so I lent to 5 people, all A+ rating. 1 of them defaulted, and another was 30 days late. Later I noticed they say you're supposed to spread it among dozens of people. Seriously? Is this the answer? I can't get past the fact that there's no consequences of defaulting, other than not being able to borrow more. It just sounds like a flawed concept. They can supposedly report them to credit agencies, but of course it isn't effective. Without some kind of collateral they can put in escrow before getting a loan, this is a great way to make money for scammers. It's really common to see "rep builder" loans, so people can build up a credit rating before they borrow a big amount and not pay back.

Cool, thanks for clearing that up! I can only find one price on their site.
I finally found it on their site, I had to use the exact correct term "spread", and here it is:
I use Bitfinex to "lock" my bitcoins, and they charge 0.2% for "market taker" rate on each exchange, so if I'm not patient enough to get the market maker discount, I'm looking 0.4% total. The mycelium wallet is certainly convenient, I'll probably use it for small amounts, even with the high spread.
I hope people are aware of the fees, this whole process isn't exactly being transparent to the user, by having a spread instead of fees, and not even making that spread easily visible.

I like coinapult and mycelium, but I gotta say something..
Just so people are a little more informed, what commonly gets left out is there is a spread. You will lose about 2% (it's variable for some reason, 0.75-2.0%) when you use this, so it is like a little insurance policy.


No, more like you'll get $920. I think it's reasonable to charge a fee for things, but it goes a long way to creating loyal fans you're honest and upfront about things like this.
Let's compare this with Bitfinex. The don't require personal information, and they charge 0.4% for someone to use them to stash bitcoins as dollars (0.2% for buying and selling). So with bigger amounts, you can really save a lot, though admittedly they can have delays in withdrawals, so everything isn't always about the cost of things.
It would be really great if this was mentioned in the mycelium app, so users can know that it isn't free. I really hope the intention isn't to hope people don't notice, I will assume that is not the case.
@_date: 2015-09-15 07:46:36
Ignore the "shop" stuff they push on you, that was the worst idea they had, it just confuses people and limits the discount. Just go to amazon.com and pick the items you want, add them to your wishlist, then paste the wishlist on purse.io
Here's the documentation on that: 
 It lets you go up to 50%, I don't know why it says 35%.
I usually get 25% off filled in a few hours. It lets you go up to 50%. 8% fills nearly instantly.
Some random caveats:
* The percent discount they list doesn't count their fees, so make sure to note what it says for "order total", and make sure that's a good deal, including shipping.
* You have to figure out the shipping cost. The easiest way to do that is add all of that wishlist stuff to your shopping cart and try to checkout, just don't actually buy the stuff. Then just note what it would have cost to ship it to you, then you can fill that in on purse.io. If you don't put anything for shipping, you'll get a message when someone tries to buy it that there's shipping costs. One trick is you can stick to 8%, and put 0 shipping, then chances are the buyer has amazon prime and has free shipping anyway, if it's a cheap item it can be worth it sometimes.
* One time, someone got swatted because the buyer used stolen credit cards to buy amazon cards, and used that to ship to the person. The stupid cops thought the criminal was shipping something to their home address. It only happened only one time as far as I know, so it could theoretically happen again.
* Don't actually release the bitcoins until the item is in your hands, and it is the right item. If the buyer sends you a tracking number, just say thanks, you're under no pressure to release the bitcoins.

* How do you backup the keys in the coinapult wallet in mycelium? I just want to be able to recover in case my phone is destroyed. I tried to make a backup but it said I already made one, wtf? If it's tying it to one of my HD wallet seeds, which one?
* What fees are there?
* When you create the wallet, is this a new coinapult account, or does it link it with your coinapult account? I set the email address to the same as my coinapult account, and it doesn't seem to share the balances.
If there are any docs that anyone knows of that explains how this works, and anyone knows about it, please share a link, thanks!

Just like if another bank isn't the source either, but you could simply show where you transferred money to coinbase, and show that you bought those bitcoins in the past, paid for with money from a paycheck.

A similar thing to this was all the rage awhile back. They were called "Ponzi", even though they weren't scams. It was like making a game based on the ponzi scheme concept, whoever deposited last paid off the first people plus 10%, so all the recent people lose. It was like a game of musical chairs. I would link some examples, but all the ones I know of are dead now. btcpile.com, btcponzi.com, ponzidoge.com.
It was a real problem with the server seeing the transaction fast enough. You could autorefund any transactions that are sent in late. Doing that part fairly proved impossible to make everyone happy, so be ready for some drama. I would still do it, if enough people are new to these kinds of games and are ready to basically gamble in a new game.
Also you have to put warnings not to use exchanges or hosted wallets, since you can't know the sending address is really them.

About the tampering? If someone uploads their own software to it that generates the same addresses over and over, or uses a not random seed, then any paper wallets printed with it will it will have private keys that are known to the attacker and they can spend bitcoins sent to those wallets. The wallets it prints are erased from its memory after printing, so it doesn't matter if anyone gets the device after the wallets are done being printed.

I started that way too, but you might get hooked. :) I had a localbitcoins ad up for 50% less than market value, with $20 limit. I got abused of course, no newbies answered the ad. One guy kept asking over and over if I would sell him more at that price, and that bittered me to that whole idea. I found it more fun to just be a regular trader, trading for a fair price, and I still meet a lot of newbies that I can help, and drill into them that they need to make backups, use 2FA for anything online, etc..
I've done trading over Mycelium too, 3 people so far. I have to say the crowd that uses that is more shady than localbitcoins. The reputation system just sucks on Mycelium, they have a lot of work to do before it's really usable. Ability to just look up profile of the person answering the ad is critical, and you can't do it. I still use it, but I put a higher price to compensate for all the fraud and flakes that message me on it. You already mentioned you get a lot of online fraud, one guy pretended to be local, wasted my time with me showing up and said "I can't find the place, can you just paypal me?".

They take USD also now (only if you're in the US), and the funds stay as USD.  in case anyone is confused and thinks they're pulling a Circle.com and are pretending Bitcoin is measured in USD.
It is a shame, but they gotta make a service the people will use, or they die. Bitcoin tipping seems to have died down, at this point I think giving a bitcoin tip is seen as trolling if it's on other subreddits, at least it's how I feel about it. I always tip $2 minimum too.
I don't blame them at all for this, given that they let the user choose, if Bitcoin is the better option, people will choose it. It's not their fault if people choose debit cards to deposit and paypal over bitcoin. More people need to use bitcoin and spend them when possible, instead of HODL.

I did that in April, I was charged a $3 "convenience fee", and libertyx didn't refund me anything when I emailed support and opened a ticket. I had other problems too (they have a confusing tier of limits), and they addressed that but not the extra fees. I guess I should have been more demanding? I think the only fault just lies with them making that claim. Who is Libertyx to say stores can't charge extra fees for using their QPay gateway?
At least all of this is revealed before the buyer hands over cash, if the price is too high, people should just walk away and just eat the cost of having their time wasted. DO NOT just buy it anyway and expect to have libertyx make it right, it's not up to them.
If anyone wants to use them, I would stick to check cashing places and not cell phone stores, if it's a store where people are filling up minutes on prepaid phones, they're going to jack you. But at a check cashing store, there was no extra fee.

The limitations are insane. You cannot manually give or trade the tokens, you can only either use them, or sell them on their exchange for a fixed price. Then the buyer can only use it, they cannot resell it later.
This is such an interesting puzzle to me, why not just directly sell gold for game time on the store? Why do they need to add this layer of other players buying it if the price is fixed? Does it get around some law? Or maybe it makes it not seem like this is just Blizzard selling gold for dollars, so the players will accept it?

This is probably getting downvoted because this is not wise. If you store bitcoins at coinbase, there is a good chance they'll lock you out of your account. You think it won't happen to you just because you're not a criminal, but if you send to someone's localbitcoin wallet (some people use it as a wallet), they'll accuse you of trading there and shut you down. Just be careful, and don't keep your bitcoins on places like circle or coinbase.

Good intention, but how about supporting shops that already take bitcoin? If this was inspired by the Morgan Spurlock thing, notice that he went out and bought something at all the local shops that do take bitcoin. He didn't seem to know about coinmap or airbitz, but we do! Just find all the places near you, or even not that near, and make a trip!
I make a point of going to all local stores that take bitcoin and buying something and paying with Bitcoin. At most of the places, I was the first person to pay with bitcoin... and probably last at this rate. The only way this is going to take off is if stores that do take it can say it has been worth it, and so far the opposite has been true.
I tried making a thread for other people like me to go out and support local shops that take bitcoin, but it got very little response.
There were other stores after that, but I didn't bother updating the post, nobody cares.
I thought of tipping at resturants with bitcoin, but obviously leaving a cash tip, then a paper wallet as an ADDITIONAL tip, but I'm way too shy to do that. :)
Or is just mass harassing stores to accept a weird payment method that very few will end up actually using be a better idea?

I have to call bullshit on that, I had a similar thing happen to me, where they locked my account without telling me. When I emailed support, they didn't know what the problem was. 5 days later they reply saying I need to verify. I did that immediately, and within a few days I was finally back up and running. Nobody is saying circle should ignore KYC/AML, but they need to step up their game on the way they handle verifying people. Why not send me some notification, or even indication on the website what is happening? They can't still claim that having to verify accounts is a new problem and they just can't figure out how to handle it.

Read the article again. Here's a quote:


The complaints are all about how the situation was handled. They let him use it as a wallet and send bitcoins to it. He also gives a good suggestion:


So if they 1) Not allow people to use accounts until they verify, and 2) clearly tell customers if they have to lock accounts that their account is locked and even though it says they have 0 BTC, their bitcoins are safe until they are done verifying, then there would have been nothing to complain about.
Denying people access to their accounts without telling them should be a customer service no-no, and making bad experiences public are a good way to make a company do better next time.

I'll just address that point only. If you feel a business sucks, you want to warn people so they are better informed. I know I like knowing if a business randomly freezes accounts to verify people. If you think a complaint is unfounded, you can downvote it, or post in the comments explaining why it's bullshit. But just telling people they should shut up as they stop using a service isn't helping anybody.
Then there's the aspect where the company is motivated to get off their ass and make it right. If people get bad service from a company, I think it's great that complaining about it can actually have a positive impact.

Are you talking about online or local shops? I see discounts for the places I go, such as amagimetals and gyft. I think they want people using bitcoin because there are so many advantages online, such as no chargebacks, currency conversion fees and other headaches associated with taking money from people in other countries.
But in-store doesn't seem worth it unless you're a big fan of Bitcoin and just want to support it. You'd have to make your POS system support it, then figure out how to handle the accounting. Then you have to train employees, and hope they remember in case by some miracle they actually get a Bitcoin sale. It is more work than most people probably realize.

I didn't run into problems until after a bunch of transactions, and the OP was right, they just handle it really poorly. Most of what it being complained about is that they lock your account during the process, and don't even make it clear what is happening. When you contact support, they tell you, but the whole way they handle it is really unprofessional. I don't use circle anymore, but this comment just begged to be corrected. If you buy small amounts only a few times, you probably won't get flagged. But if you want to buy enough to pay for a new PC at newegg, prepare to have your account mysteriously get locked, and after contacting support, they'll tell you to verify, then after 3 days you can get access to your money again.

Not sure how you actually don't understand this, but I'll try to explain. If a business accepts bitcoin and they got a lot of business from it, that fact would spread. As I explained already, it appears that most businesses that take bitcoins in-store (I'm not talking about online) do very little. So if you try to get more new stores to take it, without also rewarding shops that do, then you'll have to play a game of getting new signups faster than they realize that nobody will support the ones that do. If you are against supporting shops that do, then you're part of the problem. Why not instead of insulting me, support this effort?

Since all it does is print randomly generated paper wallets (you stick it into any printer with a usb port for printing photos), the only risk is if someone smart tampers with it and makes it print predictable wallets.

Are you saying that saving credit card fees are the reason any merchant has accepted Bitcoin payments? For online sales there are many advantages, especially doing international business, do I really need to list the reasons?

If not for the "100% premined" style of distribution of the 500M USD worth of oil for the Ripple machine, I would be less against it. I'm still more in favor of Bitcoin and other altcoins since they seek to actually replace the corrupt inflationary fiat system we have now instead of pulling an Obama where "change" really means "business as usual". If Ripple wins, we're still stuck using USD forever. If it ends up getting really popular, I'll use it. I just think it would be a shame if that is what wins, when we had a chance at disrupting fiat and making our money more honest.

It is also good if someone doesn't have a credit card and wants to buy things online. Also services like this are a handy thing to have around, like an "or else" you can threaten a merchant with. Accept bitcoins or else I'll just use snapcard. Then if the merchant refuses to accept bitcoin, then you'll never log into their site, and they lose the chance to upsell you things or sell your info. And if they see a lot of sales coming from snapcard, they'll be motivated to cut them out, and reap the benefits of accepting bitcoins (no chargebacks!).

This would have been a lot more constructive if each question was in the form of "What can we do to solve or improve  ___?".
The awesomeness of Bitcoin is that it makes a great platform for other solutions to be placed on. We can live in a world with lots of virtual currencies as long as they can be exchanged. So if we're never able to outright solve the problem of long confirmation times or everyone having to store lots of data and bandwidth to store the whole chain, people can use these little islands of value like coinbase. At that point bitcoin becomes the store of value that others are backed against.
All of this whiney talk about threats to bitcoin keep thinking of it like a product by a company, but it is really just a platform for others to build on and workaround all the problems.

The complaints I see are mostly about how they handle it. Coinbase is just as bad though. It is like these companies are unable to handle it professionally.
When I signed up to circle, after a week of using it I noticed my purchases were all saying "failed" with no explanation. I emailed support, and they replied saying they were aware of the problem and they would get back to me. 5 days later I get an email from them asking me to verify. I didn't have any bitcoins in my account so I don't know if they would have been locked.
They should give meaningful error messages when this common thing happens, or have ways for you to preemptively verify your account to avoid future problems. I don't really care if these companies do this, it is their decision on how to run their business, and is my right to just not use them. I just felt the need to correct what looked like an honest misunderstanding from people reading complaints about this. No rational person is saying that these companies should ignore regulations. The guy in the article even says:


If you read the article, you can see the complaints are about them giving unbelievably bad service to people that buy or sell too much, and denying people access to bitcoins they sent to their own wallets. It would be nice if they would at least get some bad PR from this, so they might be motivated to improve, but instead most people just read what they want to read and miss the point.

I'm in support for a service like yours, but come on, this isn't for everyone. The reason we have centralized exchanges is so people can do lots of buys and sells quickly and with almost no fees. If you want to compare your service to an exchange instead of just other brokerages, you won't win on all fronts. Yes it is great to have no risk of the exchange going insolvent, but us day traders just factor that in as part of the risk. So far I just use multiple exchanges to spread out the risk, but if your service can accommodate this without risk, I'm all for that!
If I want to use cryptotrader bot to do high frequency trading with Novauri, can I? It would be nice if we can do lots of small buys and sells without holding private keys, and if you guys have figured out how to do the impossible, that would be a real game changer. But things are only impossible until someone figures it out, so I'm always looking out to see if someone has some clever way of doing it.
Like the other guy said, this will be great for people who buy and sell occasionally. I think it is more something to consider for using instead of localbitcoins, where you are just matching up buyers and sellers and facilitate the exchanges more directly. I'm looking forward to trying out the service, but it's a little cringey seeing comments saying 100% of traders should use brokerages instead of exchanges in every case.

I'd go after whatever off the shelf billing systems people use for billing customers.
I already posted this to Ubersmith, they make a web app that web hosting companies use for tickets and billing. It has support for paypal, webmoney, worldpay, etc.. so they should add Coinbase and other bitcoin payment processors!
sorry I pitched them bitpay, but they have more merchant features like the automatic daily conversion of bitcoins into dollars.
An example company that uses ubersmith is blacklotus.net, and they already allow you to pay with bitcoin using bitpay, but I suspect they do it by hand. 
The hosting company I work for also uses ubersmith, and if there was a simple clicky thing to add Coinbase, then I plan on pitching it to my boss that we accept it. I know they would love the fact there's no chargebacks, we get a lot of fraudulent credit card signups in the cloud hosting biz, so IMO that industry is just ripe for bitcoin. All you should have to say is "no more chargebacks" and you'll get people's attention. :)

Whats up with JFK in the lower left?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:53:30
I'm surprised I'm the first to give the answer. Its in this blog post:
They do have a "paper wallet" thing, but all that does is automate sending your coins to an address, then give you a paper wallet for that address. If you use it, the coins are no longer usable in your account, it is NOT a way to get the private key for your wallet, all it does is automate something you could do yourself.
I would advise that you not keep any large balances on coinbase, in the unlikely event that coinbase shuts down. It could be argued to be a small risk, but there is no cost to just use cold storage if you're going to be holding a big balance.
Coinbase is a convenient way to buy bitcoins, and is good as a platform for spending your coins. If you send to another coinbase user, it is instant and there are no fees. You can send to an email address, and if another coinbase user has that email address, it will send to them. So it has some useful features, but IMO it doesn't make a good bank.

@_date: 2013-10-18 19:37:03
Is there something similar to Coinbase that is better for people outside the US? Coinbase lets you transfer to other coinbase users with no fee with instant verification, bypassing the blockchain. I think the instant part is critical to a real life store selling things, unless you ask your customers to hang around for 10 minutes while the transaction verifies. So even if you are outside the US, I think they are good to use just for that reason, then transfer the bitcoins out of Coinbase to someplace else when you want to cash them out if you're not in the US.
If another service does that that is outside the US similar to Coinbase in features and awesomeness?

If they want to keep it as Bitcoins (good for them!!), they could use Coinbase.com. The awesome thing about Bitcoin is you don't HAVE to use a service, but can decide if you want to use a company for the services it provides. Coinbase lets you transfer to other coinbase users instantly, and lets you link a bank account for when they do want to cash out. If they don't care about any of that, they can just use a normal address like you said and do it themselves.

One thing that does scare me, are big dumb companies trying to use it, and they will turn against it after losing millions of dollars worth of it because they didn't understand how to secure it properly.

This is probably not what you were asking at all, but you could use Coinbase to just buy bitcoins at the bitstamp market price, if you can do without the fancy things that exchanges have (setting bid prices and such).
You can just link your bank account to them and transfer money to/from your bank with only a 1% fee. Another option is to push bitcoins into an exchange and just buy and sell that way, and be limited to only being able to pull bitcoins out of the exchanges, then you can use any exchange. Though I've heard horror stories about people not being able to transfer bitcoins from mtgox, I've yet to experience that.

@_date: 2013-12-21 07:50:18
I think I understand what you're misunderstanding, and I hope I can explain it. The kids are not laughing at it, they are laughing as they do it. They are asking questions about cryptocurrency, mining, and using exchanges. The laughter comes from having fun as they are doing it. They aren't doing it for the money, they just want some Dogcoins to play with, they send them to friends, and go "look at that, its in your wallet!". Try to remove yourself from your own skin for a moment and just see things from the newbie point of view. These aren't day traders, they're just regular people that are playing with a new technology. They were drawn in by the cute dog and funny meme, and are learning as they go. Some of us are in it to pump&amp;dump, but a lot of people you talk to have under 1000 dogecoin (worth 0.0009BTC) and are still having fun. If you think they are just there for profit, you are just projecting that.
All I'm trying to do is see if I can make the average user that is disgusted/annoyed at "yet another scrypt altcoin" realize what is really happening. Technologically its a clone with no innovation, but by sheer luck its really connecting with a large group.
I'm not loyal to Doge, I suspect its going to crash, but I just wanted to see if I could share my observations and make people consider another conclusion as to whats happening.

And its only going to get worse as all of those bitcoins keep going up in value.
To what you were saying about doing it before they realized, given that you can monitor address balances very easily, they could easily make a monitoring script page everyone if unexpected withdrawals happen. Now, if the person stealing the coins just disabled that alarm, then you're right.

I want to share a lesson. There is no such thing as a bitcoin bank where you can get interest on balances. I have been burned 3 times now, I think I'm incapable of learning.
First was growcoins.com, which didn't list how they make money to pay the interest. I learned that is called a HYIP (high yield investment program) and is a type of ponzi scheme. I only lost $20 on that, I bought in as an experiment, so no big deal.
Second was investing in crytpostocks.com, specifically cryptsy stock, where you get paid a portion of the fees. Sounded legit right? Well a few days ago they dropped the amount of fees paid down from 30% to 3%. oops, stupid me. I sold what I had for 90% of what I paid and got out of there. It could have been worse I suppose.
Third was buying mcxfee at mcxnow.com, i where you in transaction fees, except it was very transparent and looked more honest. Today the owner announces a shutdown, and the value drops to 1/3 the value. I lost a lot over that. Stupid me, again!
So please, if you see something that pays any kind of interest or "fees", just stay away. You're better off just buying and holding right now, then the only thing to fear is the collapse of the dream of Bitcoin.

Use that other version of oclvanitygen.exe by that Lifeboat guy, the one I linked. The official version didn't work for me, that guy fixed it to work with modern cards. And add "-F compressed" to the options so you can get a compressed key for extra credit. Then transactions are slightly cheaper. You can tell if you have a compressed key if the private key starts with an L or K, uncompressed ones start with a 5.
I recommend testing it by searching for a short thing like 1Test so you can see if it works right away. If it shows the private and public key, you're golden.

I see what you're saying, and if they are being honest, that is how it works. But since the process is not transparent, we have to trust they are not playing games with our money.

@_date: 2013-12-26 07:38:31
If things keep going like they are, we'll be in a world with many cryptocurrencies, so if Bitcoin crumbles, people can flee to other altcoins. I'm not sure how well that will work long term, but I can't wait to see. Right now the friction is like a super conductor when it comes to trading altcoins for bitcoin, so as long as there is an open market, value can flow around properly. The problem now is that we live in a world dominated by fiat, but imagine if people lost confidence in Bitcoin, they could panic and get into Litecoin instead in an instant (assuming they aren't using Cryptsy, lol..)
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:14:53
First, get the private key, that is all you are really backing up. Get your public address from your client, those always start with a 1. So for example 1JT7DHNHGKJoe7AKUHRGBu75YyfL5niPNM.
Shutdown bitoin-qt, and run bitcoind, it should come with bitcoin-eq.
bitcoind -daemon
(then give it a bit to warm up)
bitcoind dumpprivkey 1JT7DHNHGKJoe7AKUHRGBu75YyfL5niPNM
then it will print out your private key, it will start with an L or K since its a compressed address (nevermind what that is), or a 5 if its an older address.
Now you have your precious little private key and you can do whatever you want with it, save it on a usb stick, print it out, or find something that lets you print a QR code from it. You can even import that into blockchain.info if you want to manage it there. But if you're trying to make a secure offline wallet, dont do that of course. :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:12:20


If they are smart, they are password protected with an extremely long password.


If they had their hot wallet completely emptied out by a hacker, that would not affect user balances, just think about it for a few seconds. They would have to take a percentage from every balance, or find some way to pass the loss onto customers.
I think the biggest risk is of coinbase just shutting it doors and vanishing. It unlikely, but it has happened to a few exchanges and online wallets lately.

I hadn't thought of it as being a thing you had to choose between. I have a lot of Bitcoins and Dogecoins. I am finding it easier to get my friends into Dogecoin than I had getting them into Bitcoin. I gave someone some free Dogecoins to get them started, but they never even considered using Bitcoins.

If yes, this is relevant to my interests.
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:34:29
It could just be the next wave of people. Watching Dogecoin grow was like watching a band play a song that they have played a lot before. Within days we had 5 pools, a block explorer, 2 faucets, and even a reddit tipbot. People were offering things for Doge like steam games, draw pictures, etc.. Its like you say, the whole bitcoin movement but with a new group of people, and at an accelerated rate.
Except this time, this new group gets to feel like its THEIRS. They are proud of Dogecoin.
When they share their memes, people laugh and post replies with their own memes. I wish people would learn from this and stop being so uptight, thanks to Doge we're getting more people in Bitcoin.

The risks with coinbase are that they are like a bank, where they don't have to keep all of your bitcoins available to you. There could be a "run on the bank".
At this point if they were hacked and someone stole bitcoins, it would be THEIR bitcoins.
Also you have to trust that they don't just go out of business and disappear. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:30:58

Besides the obvious risk of someone getting into your account (which you can pretty much solve by enabling 2FA), there is the risk of coinbase.com shutting down. It is a very real risk, quite a few exchanges and online wallets have just up and vanished lately, so you should at least realize you are taking a risk if you keep a large balance at coinbase. Granted the risk is lower than most sites, but it is still there.
If they don't go out of business, then at least if anyone steals from coinbase directly, your coins are safe since your balance there isn't tied to any wallet.

@_date: 2013-11-23 01:35:11
That is very scary. Another site I use did the Coinbase API thing, so what I did was make a 2nd coinbase account. You don't have to link the 2nd account to a bank or anything, so you can make as many accounts as you want, you just need a unique email address per account. You can send coins between the accounts instantly and with no fees. So when you want to buy something, it is a little extra hassle in that you have to bounce the funds to your other account, but its worth it for the security.
I made an account for my phone, and for my company, and my personal one is the only one that is linked to a bank account. So I don't even have access to my main coinbase account from my phone, if my phone gets hacked they can only get at the coins in that account.

This has nothing to do with your question, but I recommend these options for vanitygen:

-k to keep going if it finds one, so that the above option makes sense.
You could also try a shorter string if the one you want is long, then you have the option of settling for a shorter one if the one you want never comes up.

Commoners aside, I wonder what would happen if in many years from now Bitcoin is mainstream, and large corporations are trying to use bitcoin. Think about how incompetent most big companies are, they would hire contractors, and implement "physical security" around the computers that store the funds. Then some hacker just has to get their way in and they could steal everything.
Or lets say a government accepts it and starts using it, and someone steals the entire defense budget, they wouldn't just accept that. I think long term there's some real problems with cryptocurrency, so we'll always have something else that stupid people will have to use.
Either that, or they'll all use a 3rd party "bank" to manage the bitcoins for them.

I was basing it more on real events than what the numbers were at, I'm in it for long term. If China was going to just continue embracing it, in the hopes of dethroning USD, I'd be all in, but if China is going to outright outlaw people from accepting it for payment, then that is super bad news. I didn't sell everything, just enough to cover my initial investment as a hedge. I'm not going to sell anymore no matter how low it gets, who knows what other news will come out, Bitcoin might do well even if it can't ever be used as currency in China.

I love these articles that take the all or nothing approach. They always mistake Bitcoin for a finished product instead of what it is, which is a protocol.
Services will emerge (BTC banks?), that will charge fees, and in exchange for those fees, provide protection against mistakes and theft. Those of us that can handle it ourselves can have the choice of doing that.
I wonder if wired would have made an article about the internet when it was new, and say the fatal flaw is that it is too slow.

Not sure why I'm responding to a troll, but forums are a different thing than reddit.

I would just worry about things that the IRS can easily watch, such as where the dollars came from. If you made a withdrawal from your bank account for thousands of dollars at an ATM (localbitcoins) or ACH transfer (coinbase.com, etc..), you might have to explain that. 
Same goes for the deposits.
I've yet to be audited, but my strategy is to keep the winnings in bitcoin, I sold off enough where I have broken even, and all my gains are in bitcoin, and I am holding until MOON. :) I hope I'm not breaking any other rules by doing that, like are we supposed to pay sales tax? I'm in California, and I bought coins from coinbase.com, which is also in California. I hope I'm not supposed to pay sales tax. I have to pay sales tax on buying gold locally.

@_date: 2013-11-11 20:58:00
They don't hide this fact.
Your coins with coinbase.com are not really in a bitcoin wallet, so when you see a balance in your account, that is like them giving an IOU to you. So its like a bank in that there could be a "run on the bank".
So while it is PROBABLY safe, in that they have a lot to lose, if they go out of business or just vanish, you'll lose your bitcoins. If anyone has a lot of bitcoins, they should put it in some kind of offline wallet, and just use whatever strategy works for them to protect their investment.

I was thinking more about network connectivity problems than hackers doing doublespends. I've had it take a few minutes to even see the transaction appear on blockchain.info, so even if you would just trust all transactions (which is reasonable in a coffee shop type of environment where the most they could defraud you was some drinks), there is still a delay. I am still convinced that a (for the lack of a better term) "bitcoin bank" like Coinbase or inputs.io has a useful value add by doing instant verifications. Bitcoin is a great foundation for a new economy, but there are still useful things people can build on top of it.

The thing that scares me about this particular one dip, is if the rise was due to China, things could go really bad if their government is banning anyone from officially accepting bitcoin as a method for payment. All this time we're all hoping that it will catch on, and now we finally have the biggest country in the world putting their foot down against it. We all knew this would probably happen, but its a bit scary actually seeing it. All the rising has just been without resistance until now. I'm not saying it won't just go right back up, but this one feels different than the others to me. I hope I'm wrong.
That said, I am looking forward to when Bitcoin becomes more about being used as currency than just making money on the price changes.

The whole eventual zero new coins entering the economy does seem pretty grim.

Doge has attracted a whole culture around it, they think is all super serious, so like it or not, it is giving a friendly face to cryptocurrency, and is getting A LOT of newbies into it. I see a lot of posts on asking with help on using the wallet (which is just based on bitcoin-qt like all altcoins), and help with mining. Where have these people been when Bitcoin was getting popular, with all the other altcoins?
They might not stay with Dogecoin if it ends up just being worthless like all altcoins really are, but these newbies over at Dogecoin are getting experience with what is basically Bitcoin, but having a lot more fun doing it.
While they encourage memes, we ban or shun those posts here. Can you blame light hearted people from preferring Dogecoin? While they both have the same actual benefits and problems, it is just more fun for newcomers to get into.
If anyone doesn't believe any of the statements I have made, I will be happy to back them up with links, I just don't want to spend 15 minutes going through my history and linking posts if I don't have to.

But this was in his post:


So he was saying, it doesn't matter how long of a phrase it is making your wallet more crackable.
I don't see less entropy as a good thing either. And with mining being less profitable, there will be more money in cracking brainwallets because its such an easy target.

Read the whole thread on bitcointalk, the developer guy really helped me a lot. I reread it and remembered one important part, I had problems properly downgrading because it wasn't overwriting files. He pasted a batch file to manually delete the files.
So uninstall the driver, reboot, delete the files, THEN install the 12.10 drivers. I think it comes with the APP SDK?
After downgrading, oclvanitygen worked, so I would focus on making the Catalyst 12.10 drivers work. Once you know its working and making vanity addresses, you can save those files off, then upgrade the drivers and the SDK to newest version, then restore the ocl files, and be able to use oclvanitygen without being stuck on old ass drivers.
When you get all of that working and the vanity addresses, you can make altcoin vanity addresses too if you're into those at all. I was so proud of my Shitcoin vanity address

What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:48:49
I had fun coming up with my own strategy, maybe you could too. Just take the private key from the wallet, and encode it with your own system, and put it online in some places. Just make your own cipher, such as add 3 to each letter, subtract 4 from each number (and roll over to 9 if you're at zero) swap A for G everytime it comes up, and whatever you want to do. Its best if nobody even knows that you used any kind of code at all. Maybe hide it in a file that says "md5sum for blahblah.exe", and keep that file on whatever site you like to use for storing private files. The less people that know about a given trick the better, just be creative, make it look as close to something else as possible so if anyone finds it, it doesn't stick out as anything important. But still store it safe, don't put it on your website. :)
Then test to make sure the strategy works before you put any coins into it, practice it at least once.
If you can't get inspired into creating a clever way to hide the private keys, then do one of the mainstream things people say to do. I'd be wary of brainwallets, its easy to screw up and make a bad one, they have to be super long and the more entropy the better. I personally hate the idea of brain wallets, they take something with incredible amounts of entropy and reduce it to a few dozen characters worth of it.

Yeah I dont blame them for anything but not making a better notification about the change, it should have popped up a little notification when you logged in or something, but that is a pretty minor complaint IMO.

Sounds like you have a good plan, the private key is all you need, which is on the paper wallet.

Even if someone is capable of making a good brainwallet, I also have the argument that they will hurt Bitcoin if newbies are allowed to use it (I'm looking at you Electrum wallet!), as they will surely screw it up and get their coins hacked. If it happens during that critical period where a newbie is trying it out, you can bet they will become anti-bitcoin. We need everyone using Bitcoin, newbies included.

That is just nonsense on so many levels.
1. Stopgaps are what drives everything in the world. Great changes come one small step at a time. 
2. Sites like these will help people get comfortable using bitcoin to buy things, which could increase its popularity and the number of customers asking merchants to accept it. I want to buy things with my bitcoins RIGHT NOW, I want the future today, not after merchants just decide on their own to accept bitcoins.
3. If this kind of thing gets popular, merchants will be pressured into accepting bitcoin directly by their customers.
3. And finally, when you buy things on the site (I'm in the beta, I just purchased 2 things today), you don't even have to login to the merchant. So it has a built in privacy benefit to the service. I can't say that snapcard won't be evil with our info, but all they get is my name and address.
Stop thinking in absolutes, this is a service for those of us that already have bitcoins that want to spend them online, and I would rather be able to do that, than not be able to do that.

I see it as a good sign, if it was a scam, it would be incredibly easy to buy them.
The problems are all with how hard it is to move money securly, which is what bitcoin was invented to fix. If a place takes credit cards, you could just do a chargeback and screw the seller of the coins. When they send you the bitcoins, they are yours instantly and irreversibly. Same with paypal, but paypal even has rules against using it as a "currency exchange" and will freeze your account if they catch you.
The best site if you're in the US is coinbase.com, I won't go into detail since I can see lots of others already did.

Its for all those people with GPU miners that missed out on early adopting bitcoin, that figure they can have their chance with an altcoin. When someone defends an altcoin, it is usually one of those people. It is especially annoying watching that Feathercoin video, are they are trying to trick newbies into thinking they are bitcoin? I kept waiting for them to explain why we should use Feathercoin instead of Bitcoin, and all I heard was "the community", and 90% of the video was explaining advantages of crypto currency in general.
@_date: 2013-10-12 05:38:18
I'm a bit sad at all the hate at Coinbase over this, instant purchases requires them to hope the person making the purchase doesn't get their bank to reverse the payment. Where else can you buy bitcoins with a linked bank account and get them instantly? You don't HAVE TO jump through hoops, you can simply link your account, then wait for things to clear before you can access the coins. It is still cheaper and safer than localbitcoins.
Compare it to paypal, you can fund your account from your bank, and there's a waiting period before you can pay someone else with that money.
If there is a better site than Coinbase, that offers what Coinbase does (comparing localbitcoins to Coinbase is just absurd) please post it.

I think all of Bitcoin is like this, if someone knows you have it, that's another way to try to steal your money. I read about an online store that got threated with DDoS if they didn't pay a ransom, since they knew they were savvy enough to use bitcoins.
I thought of a good way to put it, its like growing up, when you're a kid you don't have as much responsibility and when you grow up you get more freedom but also more risk of danger.
We go from the banks just taking care of securing our money, with credit cards that let you do chargebacks, and have fraud departments that call you when they notice anything suspicious.
But with Bitcoin its like being an adult, and you have to do it yourself, more freedom but more risk. For people that will just screw it up, they should use something like Coinbase, and setup the 2FA, and never keep many bitcoins on their phone app. I wish people would stop encouraging newbies to use brain wallets, so many coins have been stolen because of that. People argue that if you use a good password its secure, but that is really asking the end user to have skill, why not just not subject people to that risk?
Oops, I got off on a rant, stopping now.

That does make sense, but what I don't get is what gives the other dozens of altcoins their value? They get traded on cryptsy even though there's no market where you can buy goods or services with them. I'm not disagreeing, I'm just feeling out if anyone has figured out the phenomenon. Its like these things are valuable because people are willing to buy them, and they are only willing to buy them because they are planning on selling them as the price goes up, and its just this self fueling system with no rational cause.

I've had Visa's fraud department call me when something is out of pattern too, I bought something online from Hong Kong, and it kept failing to approve it at the website I was buying the thing from. Then within 2 minutes I got the call, they just wanted to make sure that it was really me buying it, and they unlocked it on the spot.
The merchants pay like 3% in fees for everything, so that money does pay for that protection.
What bitcoin does is give us a choice on if we want to be our own bank and do the protection ourselves. When a merchant accepts bitcoin, we should get a straight up 2% or more discount because they are saving that fee, on top of having the benefit of there being no way to do a chargeback.

That is a good point. But all these off-chain services would do is reduce the number of transactions, which lowers the load on the networkm right? Less transactions would mean less need for a million miners out there. Yeah it could stunt the growth, but I wonder if that is a bad thing? All that matters to me is a healthy network where we can transfer bitcoins around, and as long as the difficulty adjustments keep it so it is worth doing, people will do it. For coinbase users, they can send their bitcoins to other users, so it becomes like a bank, except this time your off-chain bitcoins are backed by actual bitcoins, so that is what I think makes this better than what we have now with fiat. At least I hope.

Stay calm. When you finally get access to your money, just withdraw it all and use another bank. Perferably a smaller bank that isn't too big to fail.

I'm probably misunderstanding, but does this site use their own credit cards and pay on your behalf, or does it just use your own credit cards?

I agree with all of that. Dogecoin brings zero innovation, but we have a coin that's popular with the kids. They get to have that fun that Bitcoin was before all the people came in just to make a fast buck on the price changes.
I think people forget the marketing aspect of this. I welcome whatever speeds up the adoption, and I wish this subreddit would at least respect it. People are getting comfortable using it, and once they realize that more people take bitcoins, its just a few clicks to convert Dogecoin to Bitcoins at Cryptsy. I guess its like a "gateway coin" ?
I'm not even actually in the Dogecoin camp, I'm in both. I just see a lot of ignorant people (not you!) making hateful comments about it, even though Dogecoin is actually helping all of us. But being hateful only makes us look like stuck up assholes that hate fun.
If only reddit had a way to tag posts as jokes/meme so people that just want to catch up on news could filter them out. I was going to say we should make a but I see its already done. But it might not have everything this reddit does, and it would bring in a lot of duplicate content.

25 bitcoins is like $17k. You're rich dude!

All you need is the private key, its easier to backup a string of letters and numbers than a binary .dat file. Or make a QR code or whatever if you're into paper.

I was more referring to the limited options for transferring cash to and from them. They simply have no good options, unless doing a wire transfer is reasonable to people? I'd rather just use bitpay.com or coinbase.com if I was a merchant, and only pay 1% fee for transfer directly to my bank account.
I'm not expressing shock at a company promoting themselves on a website they created, I was only mocking the idea of mtgox's merchant tools being used by anyone sane.

Seems like a great tool for the IRS. :)

If they accept bitcoin donations, they could use a site like bitpay that lets you lock in the exchange rate at the time the bitcoins were recieved, and they would only take 1% out in fees (realistically, they might even waive that fee for PR reasons). So it is no risk for them.
There has to be some other reason for them not accepting them. If wikimedia accepted bitcoins, it might give some legitimacy to it, and they might not want to do that.
