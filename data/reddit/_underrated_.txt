To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. Its future applications are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of computing and economics most of its possible functions will go over a typical investor’s head. There’s also Sitoshis’s free market outlook, which is deftly woven into his creation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Robert Malthus, for instance.
The shills understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this coin, to realise that it is not just speculation - it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the brilliance in Satoshi’s brilliant programming method - the “Blockchain,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Haber and Stornetta's Merkle trees. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as our lord and savior's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bitcoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid

I mean dude makes like 20 tweets a day, and most of them are embarrassing enough. If he tweeted rarely and was a sane person, price would definitely had a jump. But since he tweets shit all the time, it loses its allure and influence after some time.
 On the same day (yesterday) he also wrote this 
 &gt; or a very nervous and skinny version of Pocahontas (1/1024th), as your President, rather than what you have now, so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius! Sorry to say that even Social Media would be driven out of business along with, and finally, the Fake News Media!
 Unironically hyping himself up by calling himself great looking, smart and a true stable genius haha.

Thanks, can't go on that subreddit right now since I'm in hurry on mobile, but will definitely save this comment. I assume by its name that it's subreddit for us high IQ folks to gather. Thanks for bringing it to my attention, I will finally now have a place to have high IQ discussion about Rick and Morty somewhere.

This is good for bitcoin

 BRB. I'm going for a bank loan and I'm gonna buy 5 bitcoins for $35k. I will be literally on same level as person that currently holds $35k worth of coins that he bought for $200.
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:49:11
No it's not. If you bought at like $300 you're still in big profit even though you could've sold on 20k, but if you bought at 20k, you're simply in big minus.

Well by your logic, then basically everyone that ever invested into something is in loss because they probably always didn't drop out/sell something at its pure peak maximum price.


 But you're combining two different investments here. It goes from lottery ticket ''investment'' to bitcoin investment from lottery winnings.
But in this case we're just arguing the same investment.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:10:44
Yeah, but let's say those both bought 1 BTC each. One bought it at $300, if they sell it now they're in plus of $6,700 which is ROI of like 2000+%, and the second person if they sell it now they're in minus of 13k.
 Even if it goes up to $25k now, that person who bought it in $300 would still be in far better position than the person who bought it in $20k. He simply has bigger profit/smaller loss any way you look at it. It's simply not identical. It is only when you use your logic.
