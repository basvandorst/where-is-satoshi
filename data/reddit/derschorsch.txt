Adoption won't grow in the first place if transaction fees are too high. There could also be a case where higher adoption results in more decentralisation, since the size of the system and number of participants increases. So preventing a reasonable block size increase will just slow down adoption and not improve decentralization in any significant way.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:33:24
So when will decentralisation practically matter the most?
Maybe when the Chinese government forces miners to prevent certain transactions - in which case Bitcoin's censorship resistance would be broken, regardless of 1mb or  8mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:41:17
I think a compromise that many would have been happy to accept would be:
Segwit as a hard fork, together with a 2mb block size bump. Activation threshold like 80%, then activation within like 3 months.
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:30:21
So how long will it take until mainstream consumers not just fiddle around with Bitcoin wallets, but payment channels on top. Not before 3 years I reckon, if at all.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:26:37
Decentralisation without adoption isn't worth much.
So what's the downside of a modest block size increase? Mining fairness is not an issue since propagation is fast enough with technologies like the FIBRE protocol.
Number of full nodes - we have about 6000, so compared to the present mining centralisation (a handful of Chines miners control most of it), node count is not the limitating factor for decentralisation by any means.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:19:38
Yeah, but that machine payable web where your fridge automatically orders milk with Bitcoin is still a few years away. Meanwhile Bitcoin has to compete with other cryptos, so just relying on the digital gold use case and hoping that 2nd layer solutions will then suddenly trigger its breakthrough as a currency isn't good enough imho.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:52:22
When would you expect a significant number of consumers to use lightning? Bitcoin is already sort of complicated for them, with LN they then have to worry about how many channels to open, how long to keep them open, how many funds to lock in..
Also there are competing standards of LN, and especially the routing protocol isn't ready yet. So even if LN was enabled tomorrow, hardly anything would change in terms of consumer adoption.
And in terms of Bitcoin + IoT, machine payable web kind of use cases, they are still some time away.
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:13:07
Let's make it super safe = no hard fork activation in the next 18 months. Will see how high transaction fees get til then..
Bitcoin market share will likely drop further
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:36:35
Lightning will become necessary if too many users want to transact with Bitcoin. But that will only become the case if adoption of Bitcoin as a payment network keeps increasing (not talking about HODLers), which will become difficult when fees keep rising as they do.
Lightning is at least 2 years away from consumer adoption, and it will complicated the user experience so shouldn't be forced unnecessarily at the expense of on chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:45:45
Segwit adoption will take some time, so the 1,7-2,1 mb block size bump won't be available straight away.
Nested p2sh, a merkel tree within a tree.. and the fact that it's somewhat of a disguised hard fork. Saying "this is an anyone can spend transaction" to old nodes, so having no meaningful info in the main block basically, so they can't validate - and then stating in the extension block "actually not everyone can spend this transaction".
So it's a somewhat clever hack but still a hack. Then the political aspect: The other camp won't activate Segwit because, among others, it reduces their leverage to force an additional block size bump - which you guys probably won't do within the next 18 months.
So bundling Segwit and the block size hard fork increase together would be just another attempt of finding some reasonable middle ground. I'd prefer that over the BU approach, but if no such compromise can be found, I'd rather take a chance on BU than watching fees go up in the next 1,5 years or so and having Bitcoin's market dominance decrease.
@_date: 2016-06-18 08:53:58
Good one, you should post it under the Forbes article too
@_date: 2017-01-20 10:43:36
Ok, so that leads to 2 questions I guess:
- How is the relationship between block size increase and UTXO set growth? I wouldn't think 10mb block size = 10 times as much UTXO set, but that should be evaluated
- Did above researchers take the UTXO set growth into account?

Good on ya, must feel great!
@_date: 2017-01-19 23:12:21
Massive scaling on second layers, yes. But in terms of on chain scaling, both Cornell University and ETH Zurich researchers concluded that on chain throughput can be increased by a factor of at least 10 without furthering mining centralisation
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:19:46
How, by making Bitcoin expensive to transact for 99,9% of the users to please the &lt;0,1% who want to run Raspberry pie full nodes, hence driving away businesses like Yours that provide actual utility?
Stalling a moderate block size increase like Segwit + 2mb and betting on not-ready, unproven technology like Lightning is the riskier move.
@_date: 2016-06-09 01:40:04
You can do selfish mining (only propagate block after you found the next one, so miners waste resources solving the block you already solved) regardless of latency.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:20:55
It will take several years for lightning to eventually gain broad adoption. There's no infrastructure yet, no network of merchants and payment hubs and not even a standardised routing protocol to make the LN work in a decentralised manner.
Also, the economic viability and user acceptance is anything but certain to turn it into a mainstream success.

Signature data will be in an extension block that is larger than 1mb
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:36:02


Sure, the code for a 2mb HF should have been provided 12 months ago already, but to this date it's not even on the Core roadmap. Also, those who signed the agreement didn't even bother trying to defend and promote the block size increase. Rather the opposite, e.g. Luke going backwards by proposing to _reduce_ the block size to 300kb.
My guess is that you're pointing me to the fairly recent, far from ready Spoonnet now, or maybe Luke's 300kb proposal, some discussions on Github without a BIP or actual code, or maybe even to sipa's proposal that already existed prior to the HK agreement which doesn't satisfy it. I've heard it all but maybe you can surprise me.
A good read on the mailing list:


Without the NY agreement the UASF would have had less than 5% hashing power and confirmation times of more than 3 hours per block. Anyway good news that Segwit activated, but down the road those who oppose the HF part of Segwit2x may be in for some bad news..
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:01:08
Probably, yes. By shills are you also referring to the numerous anti-Bitmain posters who questioned Jihan's integrity to honour agreements?
As positive as the activation of Segwit is, it should also be a moment to reflect for some.
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:55:47
So how come this kind of payment channel doesn't need malleability to be fixed?
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:14:53
Special thanks to the participants of the NY agreement (including Bitmain) who lived up to their promise to activate Segwit. Unlike some Core devs, they honour agreements that they signed.
@_date: 2016-12-22 16:18:56
How's that different from normal lightning, especially in terms of malleability?
You open a channel saying it contains x btc for a duration of y, then do off-chain txs, then post the final account balance when closing the channel.
@_date: 2016-12-23 11:03:23
So could Teechain support multi hop payments as well?
Could it be integrated into a LN routing protocol, maybe with an additional flag saying "channel requires teechain" ?

Bitcoin in store payments won't happen before lightning. Only in form of Bitcoin based debit cards
@_date: 2016-09-23 03:30:23
It sounds like a silly concept, but you could probably think of some use cases where it makes sense:
E.g. participants owning the shared infrastructure and exchanging peer to peer with Byzantine fault tolerance, hence removing the need for an intermediary that could become too powerful and therefore able to charge high fees or becoming susceptible to bribes.
However all parties need to comply with a certain legislation, so you can have a government actor that's allowed to edit the blockchain if a court order exists.
It's not that black and white, governments can't edit the Bitcoin blockchain but that doesn't mean they can't press charges on Bitcoin fraud elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-09-13 04:37:58
Projects like this help to create a positive network effect with the new asset class use case of Bitcoin. Quite a bit of idle capital sitting around otherwise.
@_date: 2016-09-03 14:01:08
Yes theoretically more velocity = lower price since a token can be traded more frequently, hence you don't need as many tokens.
But practically adoption and security/censorship resistance should be the more important factors when it comes to considering the effect of block size on price.
@_date: 2016-09-03 13:42:51
Seems like some wallets are still very poor when it comes to fee estimation. E.g. the blockchain wallet is a pain when it comes to setting custom fees. Not user friendly at all, have to manually calculate the difference between input and output, and there's no suggestion as to what sort of fee would roughly result in how many blocks to confirm
@_date: 2016-09-10 01:11:50
Unless you are under served by the fiat banking system, there isn't much incentive to pay with Bitcoin currently.
I'm positive it's gonna got there though eventually - more adoption and higher market cap will result in less volatility, hence it becomes more attractive for merchants to accept it and they would be able to offer a discount for using bitcoin vs credit cards to customers. If that happens and fees of acquiring bitcoin drop as well, customers have an incentive for spending bitcoin.
In the meantime, the store of value use case and intermediary solutions like bitcoin backed credit cards will help creating the necessary network effect.
@_date: 2016-09-13 02:19:04
You are showing that one node can receive a lot of data. However that's quite a different scenario compared to all nodes on the network simultaneously sending and receiving a lot of data. I'd expect latency to be the main issue here, rather than just download speed.
Studies from e.g. Cornell have shown that with more than 4mb block size, the node count would start to drop significantly. What sort of node count are you forecasting with your model, and how many full nodes to you consider necessary?
For me personally, the data volume would be the main reason not to run a full node. Download speed isn't a problem, but a &gt; 1TB data per month plan wouldn't be cheap.
Also, mining centralisation likely increases with larger blocks. What's your take on that?
@_date: 2016-09-03 14:09:28
yeah it's quite ridiculous. Shouldn't be that difficult at all to estimate fees, especially if wallets would look into the current mempool they should be able to come up with a decent recommendation of fee x = confirmation in y blocks.
And it's not like Blockchain lacks the funding to implement a half way decent functionality for custom fees.
@_date: 2016-10-10 07:25:45
Really, did u appeal the youtube decision?
@_date: 2016-10-13 01:57:03
Yes, the more specific calculation imho would be:
If you're the only Segwit user and a vanilla tx signature takes up x% space of the transaction, then your tx will be immediately x% cheaper. So still not as much as if everyone was using Segwit, but still a fair bit. Kinda in a rush so couldn't find more accurate info regarding standard tx size vs their signature part ;-)
@_date: 2016-10-13 09:00:37
It would increase storage reuiqrements, hence the number of full relay nodes may drop a little from 5000. However when it comes to centralisation, the node count is very negligible compared to the mining centralisation problem. Ultimately, Bitcoin is competing against other cryptocurrencies as well, so if it makes unreasonable capacity vs security tradeoffs users may switch, which will ultimately cause a loss in hashing power and Bitcoin security.
@_date: 2016-10-09 01:19:26
So what are the scripting limitations of MimbleWimble? Apparently it can do multisig and time locks, hence support lightning, but what significant use case wouldn't be possible as with bitcoin's scripting?

The digital gold use case could pretty well remain Bitcoin's mine value driver, but imho that doesn't mean the Bitcoin Blockchain can create additional value to society by acting as a mulit-purpose Blockchain to some degree, at least until alternatives like Sidechains become more practical.
And if the Bitcoin Blockchain provides significant value to society, government actors are imho less likely to intervene.
All about reasonable tradeoffs, so if the throughput could be raised to e.g. 4mb within a year (Segwit plus hard fork) without affecting miner centralization (which is by far the bigger security concern than node count) then it would probably make sense to do so imho.
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:51:33
I was gonna provide feedback to the ETF as well.
Two main points:
jstolfi refers to gold as a ponzi scheme as well. He's mentioned it in multiple comments, just gotta find one to quote. 
Then I'd describe the size of the bitcoin ecosystem, as well as the wide applications of blockchains across various industries, for which some may use the bitcoin blockchain, and some already do like remittance providers. This global impact of bitcoin across different industries is quite different from a penny stock.
Regarding liquidity, there are quite a few more exchanges than the Gemini one, again across different countries which makes price manipulation more difficult.
One of the gold comments from Stolfi:
Not saying his point is inconsistent in that sense, but still important to keep in perspective imho to avoid a negative bias against bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-10 04:48:30
Yep, considering just mining centralization without the impact on node count, the network could handle 60 tps.

There are not that many small individual miners in a pool. And whilst they could swap indeed, the question is whether they'd have the economic incentives to do so.
So overall I think Bitcoin is still reasonably censorship resistant, but my point is: Compared to the 5000 relay nodes, the distribution of mining power across relatively few large actors is by far the greater concern when it comes to censorship resistance and double spend risk. So if you could e.g. double the block size and may only lose a few hundred full nodes, it doesn't make sense not to do it imho. After all, bitcoin competes against other public blockchains as well, and there's an opportunity cost for keeping it smaller than reasonable.

What does debt and monetary policy have to do with PoS, and why doesn't the same apply to PoW?
@_date: 2016-10-06 20:26:30
Not sure what you mean. PoS doesn't  indefinitely create money out of thin air and raise debt at the expense of future generations as governments/central banks do.
PoS is a coin vote, so participants can lock in existing coins to gain the right to confirm blocks, and when done so they get a block reward plus transaction fees.

The economic incentives with braiding aren't quite clear to me. Why should a miner ever stop mining on his current block and move on to the most recent if he'd still get a reward for publishing his block that he solved much later than the quickest miner?
Also, how to split the block reward and tx fees..
NG seems a lot simpler and reduces orphans too, which is the main goal of braiding

1 minute block intervals = 10% security, so just wait 10 confirmation to get 100%. Point is, you get a 10x capacity increase without affecting miner centralisation.


Theoretically if a block contains less value but is still secured by the same proof of work, then more security per $ indeed. However practically that's not really relevant, since constantly less value per block = less bitcoin adoption = decrease in network hash rate, hence less security.

Too large?
Who knows, but researchers at both Cornell Uni and the ETH Zurich disagree..
@_date: 2016-10-13 13:47:49
Sure: 4 miners control more than 50℅ of the Bitcoin hashing power, like 70℅ of hashing power is located in China. For censorship resistance, that's a far greater concern than the 5000 full nodes.
@_date: 2016-10-11 13:02:51
A pretty well respected uni, which among others simulated the whole bitcoin network in their lab to figure out the block size vs security tradeoff. Their conclusion: 1mb blocks at 1 minute intervals won't harm mining centralisation and are safe as a result.

The thing is that the most influental Core devs have to commit to supporting the hard fork and not bailing out later, removing the activation trigger etc.

Fees won't increase up to that much because users would switch to alt coins.
@_date: 2016-10-14 04:24:49


Because there is a large number of potential block chain use cases that benefit society. Some of those may end up using Bitcoin, if the cost vs security tradeoffs are right.


4tx per second would be the death of Bitcoin, it can only rely on its network effect advantage for so long.
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:54:09
If users don't have to worry about opening channels with the right partners, amounts and duration, then I suppose wallets would need to implement some smarts to do that automatically/by default?
Which means if they don't get it right, there will be unnecesary channel openings and closures, costing additional fees and network capacity.
Out of curiosity: Let's say Segwit activates tomorrow, by what time would you expect the LN to process half as many transactions as Bitcoin today?

I'll send you 1btc if you point me to the Github code prepared by Luke/Core that satisfies the HK agreement.

Because those devs present at the Hongkong agreement didn't​ follow through (where's the code for the hard fork block size increase after Segwit?), hence screwed the miners. So either Segwit2mb, or Segwit first but code released from Core and included in the roadmap to activate a hard fork later.

If miners were that keen to produce massive blocks they could have supported a big block proposal already.
I don't necessarily consider myself a big blocker, but both the MIT and ETH Zurich have done extensive network simulations and consider it safe to raise the block size. ETH suggests 1mb at 1 minute intervals.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:15:29
Entertaining read!
If Core had implemented the 2mb hard fork as per HK agreement and Jihan still wouldn't have signalled Segwit after that - then your assumptions would have a lot more credibility.
Also not sure how your theory fits with the NY agreement - are you suggesting Jihan won't signal for Segwit according to the NY agreement? Wanna bet he will?
@_date: 2016-10-07 19:23:13
That hardly says much about the feasibility of PoS. It's more complex to initially design than PoW (which would be my main criticism), but as with any alt coin, significant network effects vs Bitcoin are at play.
@_date: 2016-10-13 00:54:09
AFAIU, a vanilla transaction will become 59% cheaper with an effective block size of 1.7mb, assuming everyone uses Segwit. And multisig transactions will get an even larger discount.
So what happens if you're the first one with a Segwit transaction?
Your transaction will be a bit cheaper straight away, yes, but only a little (especially in case of the vanilla transaction) since everyone else still unnecessarily inflates the non-segwit part by putting their sigs in their, hence the relation of block space availability vs demand stays nearly the same.

The Bitcoin price is mainly rising because cryptocurrencies as a whole are growing. If you want a benchmark for how the market views Bitcoin's design choices (keeping blocks small so everyone can run full nodes..) then you should look at the market dominance. And that has fallen from 88% to 47% in just a few months.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:58:36
So much FUD..
There's no need to run a full node for the average consumer, SPV nodes are fine. Bitcoin has grown too much to artificially choke it's capacity so that some crypto-anarchists can validate their 20 bucks transactions with their own Raspberry Pi full node.
For decentralisation, the fact that 4 miners control most of the hashing power and most of them are based in China is way more significant than the fact that there are "only" 6000+ full nodes around. Even if it came down to less than 100 full nodes, the limiting factor for decentralisation would still be mining by far.
And as far as mining centralisation and the block size is concerned: Researchers have shown that the block size can be increased to 10mb without affecting mining centralisation.
Some people seem to think that the more "careful", the more responsibly and competent. However, they are underestimating 2 factors IMO:
* Bitcoin has to compete against other Cryptos, and if it makes unreasonable tradeoffs, its market share will keep dropping. It is as low as 55% currently.
* Some regulators are using a hands-off policy because there is the promise that Bitcoin will provide utility to society beyond speculation and digital gold. If transaction fees are becoming too expensive for other use cases, there would be little interest for governments to be friendly towards Bitcion. "We like to print money and perhaps even apply hair cuts as a convenient means of financing debt.. and at the same time we love Bitcoin, because it allows citizens to circumvent just that" There have already been warning signs, such as:
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:42:44
Sure :-)
I'm positive that LN will add value in the future, however I find it somewhat deceptive when Core devs try to convince people here that no additional on chain capacity is necessary after Segwit, because the LN will be "ready to go" as soon as Segwit activates.
Another challenge of the LN is that the consumer experience will likely be complicated. When Joe Blow wants to make a payment, getting into Bitcoin has it's hurdles already, but with LN he would also have to worry about who to open a channel with, for how long and with how many funds. The costs savings for end users should be somewhat significant to justify the extra hassle. And those cost savings for transactions are partially offset by the fact that payment hubs have to lock in capital in order to function as a bridge between consumers and merchants.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:41:57
There's no hard fork block size increase BIP from Core, let alone one that appears in their roadmap. As a result the Hongkong agreement was a farce.
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:53:09
Ah ok, that's pretty unfortunate :-((
Thanks to your very specific technical arguments I immediately see your point! /s
Strangely though, quite a few researchers agree that a block size increase beyond Segwit, as in the NY agreement is both urgent and safe to do. Unless you are one of those arguing that we can't afford to lose any of the 6000 full nodes, or Bitcoin will suddenly become too centralised..
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:04:25


E.g. Luke's poll:


I don't quite understand. Miners would support a hard fork block size increase as per Hongkong agreement.
As for Blockstream, I'm not buying into the absurd AXA conspiracy theory, but if you Google "BIP148 is a contentious hard fork attempt (Let's be clear)" you'll find an IMO well balanced post that reflects exactly my opinion on the matter.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:54:40
Most people here will probably be surprised how Segwit won't reduce fee pressure that much that soon - because it only works with Segwit adresses. 1.8x, yes but only if everyone uses Segwit. Multiple research groups have already concluded that raising the block size will be safe and not lead to any further mining centralisation.
When following Core's narrative, I don't see that hard fork happening within the next 18 months. They'll probably find various excuses for further delays:
* "We need to research safer activation mechanisms". Luke already made a HF BIP, albeit an absurd one that reduces the block size to 300kb. In any case, a HF with 6 months to activate and 80% hashpower support will be a lot less likely to result in a chain split than the UASF. Talk about double standards.
* "If we do a HF, let's use the opportunity to put more good features in there and do some cleanup"
* "True optimisations like Schnorr and MAST first, then the HF"
It's basically a DukeNukem3D approach: Let's only release it when everything is absolutely perfect, 99.999% safe etc.. and by then the market has moved on.
Bitcoin's market dominance is at an all-time low as we speak, and it will only continue to fall without a capacity increase beyond Segwit.
All that being said: Folks like Luke don't even have a problem with the current fees, they openly say it's how it should be.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:45:36
Exorbitant fees and falling btc market dominance are clear signs that a capacity increase beyond Segwit is needed. And it hasn't been shown that a reasonable block size increase like 2mb would lead to any significant downsides.
@_date: 2016-10-09 01:06:33
I guess the question is, what prevents miners from stealing the side chain? Since there can't be a block reward on the side chain, miners can only earn income on the side chain via transaction fees, which is a lot less lucrative than stealing all of its funds.
If I understand correctly, your main assumption is that a social consensus will prevent this scenario: Since Bitcoin miners have a reputation to loose, and since a successful side chain will improve the utility of Bitcoin, hence btc demand and miners profitability, miners won't rob a "useful" side chain.
IMHO Rootstock is finding some interesting middle ground here: Rather than trusting btc miners completely, but at the same time trying to avoid the overhead of btc nodes spv validating the side chain, add a multisig vote of trusted parties to counteract the ability of miners to steal the side chain.

Because Greg has always been against the Hongkong agreement. After Segwit Core intends to play with Mast and Schnorr signatures to gain a bit more capacity, then maybe a hard fork in 3 years as there's no urgency anyway, especially given that the Lightning network is so ready for consumer adoption /s

So when can I open a store without having to run my own server 24/7?
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:25:05
Core would probably oppose it anyway since they seem to consider a hard fork with less than 95% miner support "contentious".
As far as this stalemate has come, a compromising hard fork with 75-80% miner support and 6 months time to activate seems to be the most reasonable option. Though Core would probably insist on 95% and 12 months, because how could we dare to ignore some poor full node operator who can't upgrade within 6 months.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:48:25
I've been to a few Blockchain meetups, conferences and talked to various academics in the field. Like myself, most of them want a moderate block size increase like Segwit2mb. If you believe most users don't want that, it's probably a sign that this sub has become a disconnected echo chamber.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:24:29
Thanks for sharing. According to Luke though, the somewhat small transactions that you make over there are unfortunately spam to the Bitcoin network, and it would be totally ok if you get priced out of using Bitcoin due to transaction fees rising  to over 10 USD.
Rather than people​ like you using Bitcoin, it is more important that some crypto geeks in the first world can still afford to run their own full nodes.
That's not my view though. I hope that both the situation in Venezuela improves and Bitcoin will stay usable for you.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:05:57
Because some​ neckbeards may not be able to run their own full nodes anymore and validate their 50 bucks transactions that they do 3 times a year. Also, a hard fork with not at least 95% miner support is very contentious and scary.
@_date: 2016-05-22 00:01:19
U mean if I install it on some cloud service myself?
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:15:19
Good to see you're willing to compromise. A major source of disagreement is probably the idea that as many end users as possible should run their own full node.
IMO it's irresponsible to cripple the network for that purpose and drive users into alt coins. SPV security is fine, and for the decentralisation of Bitcoin, the fact that a handful of Chinese miners control most of the hashing power is by far the limiting factor, not the *just* 6000 full nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:26:08
There is a workable scenario IMO that should be acceptable to everyone: Core sticks to the Hongkong agreement and releases a hard fork block size increase to 2mb, to be activated 6-12 months from now. They put it on their roadmap and commit to it as a whole. In the same release, the Segwit activation threshold is lowered to 75-80% miner support.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:31:35
They will do, as soon as the code is actually released. Same as with HK agreement, they won't signal until the HF is actually implemented. Which was a wise decision, because if they activate Segwit on it's own, there won't be a HF within the next 2 years.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:52:09
It's a simple deal: Jihan would have signalled Segwit, if the 2mb hard fork was actually implemented in Core as per HK agreement. But wisely he didn't signal for Segwit before, because he knew that Core wouldn't have any significant interest in a hard fork after they got Segwit - because there vision is to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer and push as many users as possible on their layer 2 products.
On the one hand, they support UASF, which can very easily lead to a chain split, especially given that hardly any miners support it. On the other hand, they claim that a hard fork needs much more research and at least 18 months to activate. Talk about double standards..
@_date: 2016-05-22 11:13:38
Too big blogchain can easily be resolved with pruning. No need to download complete blocks that are older than a week, and from those old blocks just spendable outputs are required, and signatures can be tossed away too.
As for propagation, the only issue is that bigger blocks disadvantage Chinese miners due to their slow internet connection, but given that 1) the network has plenty of hashing power already and 2) rather too much of that based in China, the profitability of Chinese miners shouldn't be the main priority imho
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:04:53
1) Processing power and bandwith keeps becoming cheaper, which is all that matters.
2) Research has shown that 1mb blocks every minute wouldn't affect mining centralization at all.
And mining centralisation is what matters, whether we have 6000 or 5500 full nodes is irrelevant in comparision. It's not even clear if full nodes would drop with a moderate block size increase - because if Bitcoin becomes more usable, the ecosystem and as a result full nodes may actually increase.
@_date: 2016-10-27 09:22:49
If the State were to attack the Bitcoin network with censorship etc it would make more sense for them to go after the few miners first and then after the exchanges, wallet providers and Bitcoin businesses, rather than hobbyists running full nodes.
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:36:26
Agreed, I changed the poll accordingly.
@_date: 2017-05-15 07:08:06
I was aware that Luke did various hard fork research. But correct me if I'm wrong:
Above code neither has a BIP number assigned, nor specific hard fork parameters such as block size (?!) or activation period. And most of all, it is not included anywhere in Core's roadmap.
It's similar to Peter Todd's statement shortly after the Hongkong roundtable, where he said "yeah I'll do some work towards a hard fork to keep my promise, but I can't force other Core contributors to follow, so 'unfortunately' that hard fork ain't gonna happen".
But especially if Blockstream intends to become the Mozilla of Bitcoin (by your own account), that no accountability, "we're just a loose bunch of contributors writing whatever code we please in our free time, so be thankful" - attitude is bound to fail.
Whilst it's an asset to have a competent coder like Pieter Wuille and nice optimisations like shorter initial sync, priorities will have to be in line with what the community wants - if Core wants the community to adapt their software. So it's a two-way street. And going by the fact that the goal post shifted from "hashing power is king" to "let's UASF", Core does seem to have a keen interest in the community to adobt their client.

Ripple's rise, Ethereum's rise.. the rise of quite a few. Decentralization is neither binary nor a self-purpose, some cryptos are more decentralised than others, and IMO there's a valid case for a banking coin like Ripple.
But yes keeping on-chain Bitcoin unreasonably small won't necessarily benefit decentralisation either, because the ecosystem as a whole will be smaller, and payment hubs will also add a centralising factor. Hypocrits are only those who claim that small on-chain Bitcoin will inevitably lead to more decentralisation.. which you seem to do.
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:35:41
Miners will become pro Segwit as soon as Core delivers the hard fork as per the Hongkong agreement. Core screwed the miners and now tries to blame them for holding back scaling, but don't be fooled.

Fighting world banking cartels won't be successful by following guys like Luke, who already considers 1mb blocks dangerously large.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:01:25
The UASF is basically a means of pushing through Segwit without the intended 2mb hard fork on top, which was promised to the miners at the Hongkong roundtable. Hence it's an offense to miners and the majority of people who want a block size increase on top of Segwit.
Funny enough, one reason for not doing the hard fork used to be that it's too risky - even with more than 90% hashpower agreement and 12 months to activate. This UASF is way more reckless, hardly has any miner support, and can easily cause a chain split.
But maybe something positive will still come out - Segwit2MB gets activated as a reasonable compromise, and the UASF nodes just fork themselves onto a minority chain.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:20:09
Lol. I'm following the developments pretty closely, not sure if you do. Because what you refer to is Luke's infamous 300kb proposal, which actually reduces the block size to 300kb! And then slowly increases it, so by 2024 we'd hit the current limit of 1mb.
It's safe to say that this proposal isn't exactly in the spirit of the HK agreement...
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:45:57
Why, what's the problem with those devs? Do you know them personally? The screenshot doesn't even list all of them.
After all, Sergio already released the Segwit2mb BIP, it's not a big code change. Basically a small patch on top of Core, which lowers the Segwit activation threshold and then adds a second activation for the HF, which will double the maximum block weight.
Sergio Damien Lerner and Jeff Garzik have been around for quite some time, AFAIK they are involved and I'd trust them with a reasonably small patch like this.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:38:17
Ok, what's your alternative to agreements then in a decentralised system? Anarchy, or some Bitcoin police?
@_date: 2016-05-24 00:34:38
Keep it simple ;)
I know the debate is more multi-facettet than just one poll, but I suppose the purpose of bitcoinocracy is to break that complexity down into a series of simple yes/no questions, which results you can combine later to support a more differentiated argument.
So the purpose of this poll is just: Do you generally see that Core hard fork as a desirable scenario, or are you e.g. thinking no, block size should be kept 1mb to maximise decentralization and incentivise a fee market and layer 2 services as much as possible?
In other words the opposite to Greg's view, who seems to claim "people on Reddit want a block size increase, but stakeholders actually don't"
If other concerns arise, e.g. a dev saying "we should delay the hard fork 3 months because the code quality is bad" you could have another poll for that..
Or to address your last point, you could additionally vote "I believe a hard fork needs at least x % consensus for activation to be considered safe"
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:49:33
It is completely unnecesary for an end-user to run his own full node, SPV nodes are fine. It is certainly not worth crippling the network for that purpose IMO.

haha ok.. 
Sure Bitcoin's market dominance fell from 88 to 47% in a few months, more and more use cases switch to alts, but no we don't need an increase beyond Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:55:15
Yeah at the Hongkong meeting with miners, devs and others Segwit plus 2mb hard fork 3 months later was agreed, but Core broke the agreement and now blames the miners for not activating Segwit by its own.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:50:24
Rightly so.. there's pretty much zero interest from Core to do a hard fork block size increase after Segwit within the next 2 years.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:50:35
Nope just by a reasonable amount, as in BIP100, or Segwit + 2mb. Which won't affect mining centralisation.
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:25:03
Nah Greg and Luke don't want it, and Adam who's only the CEO of Blockstream and signed the agreement too doesn't seem to have an opinion or maybe doesn't dare to publicly contradict them. I don't wish anything bad to happen, but maybe a shakeup at Blockstream will benefit Bitcoin in the long run.
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:53:11
Because it conflicts with Blockstream's business model of choking on-chain capacity to force users on their layer 2 products.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:41:57
Ah too bad.. ;-((
Pretty sure Luke's brilliant 300kb hard fork proposal didn't exactly meet the HK agreement, and some theoretical "hard fork research" is all sweet, but doesn't change the fact that Core didn't release any code for a 2mb HF, or even put it somewhere on their roadmap.
@_date: 2016-05-22 14:14:19
Then pruned blockchain images should be available for download. Obviously a security tradeoff, but if trustworthy download mirrors are available, it's probably better than people not running a node at all because the initial download kills their disc/bandwith capacity.

Miners aren't stalling anything. They are pro Segwit, but only in combination with a 2mb hard fork, which was already agreed upon in Hongkong.
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:30:37
Segwit2x is supported by over 80 corporations, many of them directly serving end users so they have an incentive to act in user's best interest. Also, most Bitcoiners "in the real world" outside of this sub support a moderate block size increase.
So all in all this seems much less like a corporate takeover than the current endless stalling and goal post shifting from some Core members, who happen to work for _one_ corporation that doesn't even serve end users and has an interest to limit on-chain growth.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:14:08
One miner signalled Classic after Austin Hill refused to support the agreement. Quite a convenient excuse to completely ignore the agreement and not put any hard fork block size increase on the Core roadmap, refusing any compromise.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:10:11


Numerous unresolved challenges:
* Different LN implementations.
* A network topology with payment hubs and merchants needs to be established.
* Probably more importantly, an efficient routing algorithm needs to be 1) developed and 2) universally agreed upon to enable the LN in a somewhat decentralised manner.
The hurdles seem much more difficult than the development of Segwit to me, which took about a year to develop with quite a few Core devs involved.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:32:26


Yes, but just like myself, most of them also want a block size increase beyond that. So it's kind of mind boggling not to go with the common sense solution - Segwit plus hard fork to 2mb, as per the Hongkong agreement.


There are numerous issues with UASF:
* It can easily cause a chain split, just like a hard fork.
* Given that there's hardly any miner support for it and no broad community consensus either, it's even much more dangerous than the conservative hard fork that's being discussed. It's quite remarkable how the narrative has been shifted: A hard fork with less than 95% consensus and 12 months to activate was deemed scary, now they want to push through a USAF by the 1st August with less than 50% miner support.
* It's an offense to miners, and they could circumvent it in different ways. E.g. officially support the UASF but not mine any Segwit transactions.
* It essentially shifts Bitcoin's consensus model from PoW to a mixture of PoW + static voting by some large exchanges.
* If Core gets their Segwit via UASF, don't expect them to agree to a block size increase any time soon.
For the latter, there are several reasons IMO:
* Blockstream wants to keep on-chain Bitcoin small to incentivize their layer 2 products.
* Core devs really believe that Bitcoin should be crippled so that consumers with sub-par bandwith can run full nodes.
* They want to increase on-chain capacity via MAST, Schnorr etc, which are all nice features but take some time to 1)implement and 2) find broad adoption.

Running a full node doesn't prevent selfish mining. As for incorrect blocks (which rarely occurred anyway), it would be more than sufficient if a couple hundred economically relevant actors detect that by running full nodes.

I'm sure consumers would flock to the lightning network in no time. Worrying about how many funds to lock where and for how long makes the user experience so much better. Not to mention that the network topology for it is almost non-existent.

So which block size would be too large for you and why exactly?
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:43:04
Core is basically trying to screw the miners. They didn't deliver the hard fork block size increase after the Segwit release as promised at the Hongkong roundtable, and now they want to push through Segwit anyway without wide miner consent. 
Luke, who promotes the UASF was actually supposed to be Core's man to code the hard fork. He delivered one indeed - but not a block size increase, a reduction (!) to 300kb. A pretty blatant way to offend the miners who provide Bitcoin's security.
I hope miners will continue to block the UASF to keep Core accountable. If they release the hard fork code as agreed, activating Segwit with a reasonable majority of 80% should be no problem.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:01:23
The Hongkong agreement stated a 2mb hard fork, not merely a 17% annual increase. However Core as a whole hasn't even commited to Pieter Wuille's conservative BIP103 proposal and put it on the road map.
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:17:11
Basically the statement is just meant to capture what end result people prefer, rather than suggesting what individual devs should do:
Do users generally support the Core team more than Classic, but at the same time do they want Core to deliver the code for that 2mb hard fork?
If so, the outcome of this poll would be putting pressure on Core to make this happen, somehow.
Because currently, Greg Maxwell seems to question whether a majority of Bitcoin stakeholders actually wants Core to deliver that hard fork code in July, and there wasn't a poll on bitcoinocracy yet to answer that question.
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:57:01
One of those cases where Bitcoin could actually solve some real-world problems, but with limited throughput and high fees that's unlikely to happen unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:48:28
None of these have been targeted for a Core release or even put on their road map - which is the main point. A hard fork proposal from one developer won't do much if there isn't a dev team behind it that is commited to maintaining the fork.
So those Core representatives at the Hongkong roundtable hide behind the notion that Core is just a loose bunch of individuals which code whatever they please in their free time, hence can't be hold accountable or bound to any agreement.
E.g. Adam Back, what has he done to live up to the Hongkong promise? Publicly stating that he supports a hard fork block size increase 12 months after Segwit (maybe even get one of his employees to work on it, he's the CEO of Blockstream after all) would have been something already, but maybe he doesn't want to contradict Greg, who opposed the Hongkong agreement from the beginning. (dat famous "well meaning dipshits" - comment)
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:53:12
75℅ cheaper only if the whole network uses the Segwit format. Who knows how long that takes.

Cool where's the BIP number on Luke's​ first proposal, which block size, activation time and threshold does it suggest (let me guess, not specified), and where does it appear in Core's roadmap (let me guess, nowhere)?
A single developer drafting a half-baked proposal which won't be supported by Core, I highly doubt that's what miners expected after the Hongkong agreement.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:30:09

Of course, Mast and Schnorr will be ready in just a few weeks and customers will race to the lightning network anyway..
When do you expect your scaling solutions to make a noticeable impact? Genuinely asking.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:04:43
The alternative isn't that complicated: Core to commit to the Hongkong agreement and deliver the code for a hard fork with reasonable parameters: Block size e.g. 2mb, activation within 6-12 months with 80% majority. They include it in their roadmap and stand by it as a whole. You'll see that most miners would start signalling for Segwit then.
What should they do otherwise? Concede that they got screwed at the Hongkong meeting, but still activating Segwit (asking for no further block size increase hard fork in return) because it's just too late? That seems to be Core's negotiating tactic, just ignoring the agreement and then blaming the miners.
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:58:19
No coffee propaganda, as even most "big blockers" don't want outrageous block size increases. However the tradeoff Bitcoin is currently making is ridiculous - crippling the network so consumers can run full nodes. We have 6000 full nodes, whilst 4 Chinese miners control most hashing power - which is by far the limiting factor for decentralisation.
It's basically like installing 10 expensive, hard-to-use locks on your front door whilst keeping the windows unsecured.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:43:39


I highly doubt that. But perhaps you can point to the code on Github?
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:19:29
There's hardly any. UASF nodes could end up on a chain with less than 30% miner support. Yet at the same time, Core claims that a hard fork with less than 95% miner support and 12 months to activate would be contentious, dangerous, scary etc. Talk about shifting goal posts.
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:50:16
Segwit would probably have activated already if you sticked to the Hongkong agreement and released the code for a hard fork block size increase. Luke's 300kb block size reduction (!) proposal was a complete slap in the face, but he doesn't seem to be the only one who thinks there's no urgency whatsoever to increase the block size. It's kind of tragic because you guys seem to be capable and hard working engineers, but due to Core's unwillingness to compromise I can't feel sorry for the flag you're getting.
@_date: 2017-07-05 09:23:23
There was no proposal to increase the block size to 2mb in 12 months as expected from miners per HK agreement. Core doesn't have any such thing in their roadmap, and those who signed the agreement didn't even try to publicly promote and defend such hard fork.
You even did the opposite, stating that blocks were too large already, and no increase after Segwit would necessary in the foreseeable future. All after signing the agreement. Your proposal to _reduce_ the block size to 300kb was nothing but an offense towards miners who assumed good intentions towards a hard fork block size increase.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:36:10
Then the Hongkong roundtable was a complete farce to begin with if there's zero accountability. And talking about those individuals, where's the promised hard fork code? Luke's 300kb block size reduction proposal? Lol
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:40:44


Greg likes to claim that more than 100 folks work on Core, but most changes are done by a handful of people, with the majority of them working for Blockstream. I'm not even suggesting that they all follow some evil plan, I just fundamentally disagree with the security/cost/decentralisation tradeoff they are making. Luke e.g. seriously thinks that the current fees are ok, and even 20$ fees would be reasonable for the amazing service Bitcoin provides. Hence his proposal actually suggested to reduce the block size to 300kb!
For decentralisation, mining is by far the limiting factor, not whether we have 6000 or 5500 full nodes.


Quite a few actually do: Researchers from Cornell and the ETH Zürich recommended larger blocks after doing various simulations of the Bitcoin network. Both the HK and NY agreements also demand a block size increase beyond Segwit.
The main reason this hasn't already happened yet is because Core was against it and people don't trust alternative dev teams yet. E.g. BU, with their bugginess and more progressive emergent consensus approach. Or Classic, which seems to be a one man show. Hopefully this will change now as various actors in NY agreed to invest several millions in an alternative dev team.
My main issue with Core is their claim that Bitcoin's main value comes from the fact that consumers can run full nodes on a raspberry pie with small bandwith, and that it's totally ok to accept exorbitant fees for that. Even if the market clearly disagrees, Bitcoin's market dominance keeps dropping and use cases move to alt coins they'll stubbornly stick to their vision, unwilling to compromise.
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:36:35
SPV nodes are secure enough, because they can verify the PoW. There will always be plenty of full nodes run by businesses, so no need to run a consumer node. Even if the network does something you disagree with (e.g. miners creating invalid blocks and just continuing on that chain), an economically irrelavant raspberry pie consumer node doesn't have any power. You can only actively fork yourself off the network.
As for the studies:
1mb blocks every minute was one of them:
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:50:06
Miners already have their shit together. If they get the hardfork as per Hongkong and New York agreements, they'll activate Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:50:11
Even to this date, the devs who signed the HK agreement aren't even endorsing the 2mb HF, which was supposed to be coded 12 months ago already. Instead they are blatantly lying by claiming they fulfilled the HKA because they implemented Segwit. Also launching a smear campaign against Jihan, who's doing nothing more than keeping Core devs accountable on the Hongkong agreement. The heat that they are copping is fully deserved.
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:27:00
Even Core members admit that lightning will take several years to _eventually_ gain broad adoption.
There's no sensible reason to choke Bitcoin's capacity way below safety limits.
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:12:45


Sure, businesses like Coinbase and XAPO which try to further Bitcoin adoption by creating a better user experience (hence supporting a moderate block size increase) are the evil empire.
On the other hand guys like Luke, who propose to _reduce_ the block size to 300kb, consider most Bitcoin transactions as spam and find even 10 USD transaction fees ok are "on the right side". They also claim to be very cautious in terms of security, but then promote UASF, which can easily lead to a chain split. Also preparing a PoW change now to fight a much less contentious upgrade, Segwit2x.
Depends on your definition of "right side" I guess, but if you want Bitcoin to grow withing reasonable safety limits, your "evil empire", if you can call it that, would be rather the latter. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:42:51
You could say that when the HF code is released and he still doesn't signal. Until then, only negative assumptions. 
Same as HK agreement, if Core had actually implemented the 2mb HF and Jihan wouldn't have signalled, then you had the right to blame him.
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:58:28
One group tries to unnecessary choke Bitcoin's capacity and prevent it from growing in a misguided attempt to keep "decentralisation". This group is generally supported in this forum.
The other group tries to find some sensible middle ground, hence supports Segwit2x and this narrative:
Most users here seem to view them as villains though who somehow want to take over Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:56:29
So users have to acquire BTC first, then put them into a Sidechain, then open payment channels with the right hubs and sufficient funds for the right duration.
Seems like a lot of hassle to me in terms of the user experience, especially given how easy credit card/Paypal payments are. Better give users good reasons to jump through all those hoops.
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:46:49
Well based on the current mix of transactions, even slightly less, according to Greg Maxwell himself:
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:50:25
Jihan supports the NY agreement, which renders his Asicboost useless. The NY agreement gets Segwit activated, simple as that. Don't be fooled by Core devs who oppose a 2mb hard fork at all costs and now try to make Jihan a scapegoat for not activating Segwit on its own without the hard fork, which was already agreed upon in Hongkong. Core are the ones totally unwilling to accept a reasonable compromise.

Can't verify if true or not - p2sh doesn't have to be multisig, which most benefits from Segwit. But even if true, it will take some time to adopt. 
And that's just another contradiction:
When it comes to hard forks, Core supporters usually argue they need 12-24 months lead time to allow the last full node in Timbuktu enough time to upgrade. But when it comes to non-HF optimisations that suit their narrative, they expect them to be adopted rapidly, and if not, it's the user's own fault. In case of Segwit, it's not only node operators that need to upgrade though to realise the benefits, but also end users who need to switch to the new adress format.
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:36:36
Probably not all, but a sufficiently large majority of 80% IMO. Which Core would still likely view as "contentious" hard fork.
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:43:54
I used to be all in Bitcoin as far as cyptos, but gladly diversified a few months ago. There's this school of thought that Bitcoin's resistance to change is an amazing strength, but that's gone way to far now, and its shrinking market dominance just a logical consequence.
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:54:34
Segwit + BIP 100, exactly my preferred choice as well. Basically a more moderate approach towards a miner controlled block size than BU.
Core should release that hard fork code - to be activated in 6-12 months, with 80% consensus. In the same release they could lower the Segwit activation threshold 80% as well, and I'm positive it's gonna activate soon. Not too complicated really, but the stalemate happened because Core tries to weasel out of the Hongkong agreement.
@_date: 2016-10-09 03:42:12
So since MimbleWimble only keeps the UTXO set instead of a coin history, it wouldn't be suitable for tracking/timestamping kind of scenarios I'd assume. Unless you bloat the UTXO set for those purposes.
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:43:15
Fooled by the whole industry, including Bitcoin companies who directly serve end users. Thankfully the devs try to save the whole Bitcoin ecosystem from their own stupidity by delaying a hard fork by any means necessary. Must feel like being surrounded by wrong-way drivers on the freeway..
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:02:42
Well said, and the fact that the other devs and Adam Back don't do anything to promote the Hongkong agreement that they signed doesn't help either. They just try to weasel their way out and blame the miners for the stalemate, whilst Core is to blame due to their unwillingness to compromise.

@_date: 2017-07-24 09:56:03
If so (?), then possibly because it's mainly targeted to miners at this stage and communicated as such. Segwit2x goes by hash power, not node count unlike UASF.
Also, I wouldn't be suprised if most of the end users who run full nodes are, unlike most overall end users, small blockers. After all, small blocks make it cheaper for them to run nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:53:37


Although I don't support BIP-148 by any means, I wouldn't add some emotional bias by calling it an attack. It's just folks with different views on Bitcoin scaling. Possibly also being fooled by the likes of Luke, who make them believes it's all about fighting the evil Jihan who wants to take over Bitcoin (which isn't the case).
What I will say though is that the UASF is highly contradictory: A main argument against Segwit2x is the FUD of hard forks being dangerous, scary etc, but then the UASF can very easily cause a permanent chain split as well.
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:43:38
Yep lets fight evil miners and keep 1mb blocks forever!!1 Preventing Bitcoin growth whilst not even improving mining decentralisation is the way forward.
Does anyone want to bet against me that Jihan will signal for Segwit?

The OP seems to be the one trolling, because Bitmain still supports Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:23:02
If Core lived up to the HK agreement, he would have likely signalled Segwit already, regardless of Asicboost. If you think that prevented him from doing so, he shouldn't signal for Segwit2x either, should he?
Here's the man (or villain, according to the general narrative on this sub) himself explaining his point of view:
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:45:26
The days of consumer full nodes will be over some time, just like laptop mining. Bitcoin has grown out of that, trying to go backwards will just cause it to lose more market share.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:41:45
Not contradictory for Luke as he said numerous times that there's no urgency to increase the block size, and even a 20$ transaction fee would be a fair price for using this amazingly decentralized network.
With Luke's proposal the block size would start at 300kb and then slowly increase, so we'd have the current block size of 1mb by 2024. Funny eh?
Even amongst Core there doesn't seem that much support for his proposal.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:25:15
There was certainly the expectation that the recommendation of those present would amount to something specific, as there were some of the most active Core contributors around, as well as Adam Back, who -if he likes it or not- has quite a bit of influence in the Bitcoin ecosystem since there aren't that many companies around with 70mio funding doing Bitcoin related development.
If that expectation wasn't set, the miners wouldn't have commited not to run Classic. Perhaps some parameters of the hard fork could have been disputed, but so far Core as a whole hasn't even commited to Pieter Wuille's conservative hard fork proposal. (1,5 years activation and 17% increase per year, too little too late IMO).
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:10:41
It was a friendly gesture from btc1 indeed - activating prior to 1st August so the UASF folks can safe face and feel like winners too - rather than letting them fork onto an unsustainable minority chain.
Ironically, a main argument from the UASF crowd against hard forks was that they are dangerous and can cause a chain split - something the UASF would have done too, hence leading their argument ad absurdum.
The interesting part will come with the HF of Segwit2x, so if the UASF crowd still chooses to pursue their anti-Bitmain, anti-corporate-takeover, "let's bring power back to the users" - mission they will get their opportunity to fork. Maybe onto some LukeJR-Coin that implements his 300kb block size reduction proposal..
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:31:42


Nope, Segwit was already conceptualised prior to the HK agreement. Hence the HK agreement contained Segwit _plus_ a HF thereafter. 
Don't be fooled by lies of some Core members, who claim they fulfilled the HK agreement because they delivered Segwit. The HF code was targeted for July last year, but to this date, it's not even on the Core roadmap.
@_date: 2017-07-02 14:47:48


There was a pretty clear expectation from miners to fork to 2mb straight away, not on some funky schedule that would achieve the same in 3, 5 or 10 years.


Amazing! As you're probably aware, BIP103 from Pieter Wuille already existed prior to the HK agreement, which also had a 17,7% annual growth rate.
It didn't get consensus though because the schedule wasn't considered progressive enough. What did Luke do to solve that? Right, create a BIP that even went backwards as far as increasing the block size, by reducing it to 300kb! 
As far as "optional" is concerned, you probably didn't read further than the abstract:
*"300k is only used for the block size limit should the proposal be activated prior to 2017 April. If it is deemed too small, activation can simply be delayed until the desired limit is reached, retaining the current block size/weight limits until that time"*
So the only way to activate this proposal whilst avoiding the 300kb is to simply defer activation, so the block size will be whatever the schedule (which isn't optional) determines at that point. So if you activate it 2019, the block size will be like 400kb. If you activate it 2024, it will be 1mb. There's no way to activate it 2018 though and start off with 1mb blocks.
So in conclusion, Luke's proposal is a step backwards from the existing BIP103, which is nothing but a blatant offense to miners. It's only consistent with Luke's views on scaling though:
Some of the goodies:
* "Blocks are too large right now"
* "No block size increase is needed now. All legitimate uses of the blockchain currently amount to approximately 750k/block average."
* "No block size increase is likely to be needed in the near future. Before we reach the point that 1 MB is insufficient, we are likely to have the Lightning protocol working in production. "
Needless to say that these statements were made after the HK agreement which he signed. So maybe you can come up with some mental gymnastics to justify his actions, or sell his views on scaling as reasonable. I'm not buying into that though, and neither do businesses and miners with relevant economic stake in Bitcoin who hence support the NY agreement.
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:51:03

The Bitcoin community can't allow to be complacent and accept rising fees as a result of unreasonable tradeoffs. It's market dominance is down to 47% now as we speak.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:19:16


Nope, he explicitly stated he'll signal according to the NY agreement to activate Segwit. He would already have signalled for it after the HK agreement, if Core had actually delivered the 2mb HF. Wisely he didn't signal for Segwit beforehand, because it's obvious that Core has no interest to let a hard fork follow any time soon after Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:55:09
Exactly the opposite, both Jihan and Ver just re-affirmed their support for the NY agreement.
Unlike some Core members, they honor agreements that they signed.
I expect massive FUD from Core members and small blockers though when the 2x part of Segwit2x will be activated.

@_date: 2017-05-21 14:49:41
It's not that only miners want bigger blocks - users and merchants want it to, so it's about what's best for the whole ecosystem. Not all miners broke the agreement, only one. Arguably with a fair reason, because the CEO of Blockstream didn't support it. Whilst from Core, basically all those who signed it broke it. At least I haven't heard any of them defend the agreement of working towards a 2mb hard fork 3 months after the Segwit release.
I don't see an alternative to releasing that hard fork, and at the same time they could lower the Segwit activation threshold to something like 80%. The UASF has hardly any miner support, and it's a blatant offense to the miners in the first place. Especially since it's driven by Luke, who delivered a block size reduction proposal to 300kb instead of the 2mb increase.
My personal favourite would be Segwit + BIP 100.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:48:45
hmm yeah indeed
Well, my comment to you had a /s after the first sentence, and the last few posts from that literally account had one too. Not sure what's happening, perhaps just some strange troll.
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:00:37


Can't quite follow - you know there's Moore's law, and internet bandwidth keeps improving as well? 8mb sounds reasonable, then 10 a year or 2 later. Also, what exactly would be centralised with 10mb blocks: Mining? Or full nodes dropping from 6000 to less than 100?
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:23:49
As long as the block size is raised moderately, the centralisation risk is wildly exaggerated IMO. Segwit2MB won't lead to any more mining centralisation, and if we end up with 5500 full nodes instead of 6000, this hardly affects overall decentralisation at all since mining is still by far the limiting factor for that. Maybe the full node count will actually increase, because Bitcoin will stay usable for more people.
I totally agree that Bitcoin is precious. And for that reason, I think it should be as useful as possible to society as a whole. And IMO that's not the case if transactions become very expensive just so some crypto enthusiasts can verify their 50$ transactions on their own full node.
Also, Bitcoin doesn't exists in a vacuum. If other cryptocurrencies offer a more attractive cost/security tradeoff, Bitcoin's market dominance will keep decreasing.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:16:59
Yes, they probably want considerably larger blocks and no Segwit, but unlike Core they are willing to compromise.
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:08:05
Making Bitcoin transactions too expensive for poorer countries just so crypto geeks in the first world can cheaply run their raspberry pie full nodes and Blockstream can incentivise their centralised layer 2 products in order to pay back the 76 mil VC funding. Great cypherpunk principles..
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:29:04
Sure, UASF with less than 5% miner support would have worked. Generating one block every 3 hours, what a useful chain!
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:46:32


Yes, because it still is. Where's the routing algorithm that the various LN implementations agree upon? Where's the actual network topology with merchants, payment hubs and LN wallets? Is it even possible to create one in a reasonably decentralised manner? It will take years before LN will eventually reach somewhat significant adoption.
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:18:32
IMO, the main objective of the consensus system is to provide censorship resistance, immutability and prevent double spends. If you can achieve than in a cheaper manner, good. 
A main argument for PoS IMO is that there are already large opportunity costs in Bitcoin, because holders just sit on their coins without productively using them and earning no interest. At the same time, holders have an incentive to support the network consensus. So with PoS, that existing capital and interest of holders can be used to secure the network, and including them in the consensus should improve governance as well.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:26:53


The same can be said for the anti-HF stance of Core devs. With 3 months or more notice and the support of enough hash power and exchanges, I don't see any issues with a HF. Alt coins have successfully hard forked on numerous occasions, so I'm not buying into the "hard forks are scary and dangerous" FUD. Outside of this sub, most Bitcoiners seem to favour a moderate block size increase. Segwit delivers some of that, but the timeline of its adoption is quite unclear. See e.g.:
With Segwit, I doubt Core devs would be making serious efforts towards a HF, instead trying to provide an artificial incentive for layer 2 solutions. Bitcoin throughput has been increasing consistently over the years until it hit the artificial ceiling, so not increasing the block size and fundamentally changing the economical model of Bitcoin seems to be the riskier action here. Ironically, many small blockers consider themselves to be on the conservative/responsible side though by avoiding a HF.
Another good statement pro Segwit2x which I personally agree with:
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:40:15
Quite a few know-it-alls here claimed Jihan won't signal for Segwit to keep his Asicboost. Guess what, unlike some Core devs he's honoring agreements that he singed.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:06:54


Yes, mining is by far the biggest bottleneck when it comes to decentralisation. Hence it is absurd to choke network capacity just to keep 6000 full nodes around and claim Bitcoin would become too centralised otherwise.


Mostly Garzik, who's taking on feedback from various people on Github, including Core members. Then other parties of the NY agreement do testing.
Having Core and BTC1 is still more decentralised than just being on the mercy of Core. According to the HK agreement, they should have provided the code for a 2mb hard fork 12 months ago already. However to this date, there's not even a target date for it anywhere on the Core roadmap.
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:10:12


I do. A well intended, but misguided attempt to decentralise Bitcoin. If you want to achieve that and harden Bitcoin against government intervention (which is IMO the largest risk), make it as big and useful to as many people as possible, as long as you don't centralise mining further. Governments don't have any interest in "digital gold" as a means for people to circumvent their monetary policies, so if Bitcoin can't offer more utility outside of that, don't expect their BTC friendly "hands-off" policies to last forever.


Bitcoin is still tiny compared to the fiat banking world. They might get frightened if Bitcoin grows significantly, but low throughput and high fees are preventing exactly that. So if anything you are helping banks by encouraging people to choke Bitcoin's capacity way below its safety limits.
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:58:05
It's gonna take several years before the lightning network will make a significant impact, as there are numerous challenges to solve still. Segwit and LN are no alternatives to moderate block size increases.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:48:56
Yep since Segwit by itself only has about 30% miner support. A hard fork like Segwit2mb with 80% miner support would be much safer.
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:28:02


I'd be careful with negative assumptions, especially if someone doesn't have a negative track record. Jihan and other miners could have supported Bitcoin Classic or XT 2 years ago already. However Core members managed to prevent that with the HK agreement - in which they sated to provide the code for a hard fork 3 months after Segwit. As everyone should know by now they didn't uphold that agreement. The HF code should have been released 12 months ago already:
However to this date, that HF is not even on the Core roadmap. What's worse is that those who signed the agreement didn't even do anything to promote or endorse the HF. Guys like Luke even went backwards, proposing to _reduce_ the block size to 300kb!
A few months later Jihan even flew to California to inquire about the HF, where Core members apparently delivered further promises. So no surprise he's feeling betrayed by them. Best to hear it from the man himself:
Segwit2x is doing nothing more than enforcing the HK agreement. Jihan said he would support it and is now following through with his commitment, unlike those Core members. If Core had implemented the HF, Jihan would most likely have singalled for Segwit already. Otherwise why even bother meeting them again in California? However in addition to the "hard forks are scary" FUD, part of the reason why especially Blockstream employees seem to be against it seems to incentivise layer 2 solutions. So they embarked on a smear campaign against Jihan, who's holding them accountable for the HK agreement and tries to prevent endless stalling of a HF. Unfortunately that smear campaign has worked well at least in this sub and quite a few bought into the anti-Bitmain conspiracies.
@_date: 2017-05-20 05:41:47
Wishful thinking. Even with Segwit and LN, fees aren't gonna be low by any means.
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:30:36
Some of the most active Core contributors signed the agreement, however since then, they haven't even tried to defend and promote the intended hard fork. Guys like Luke even went backwards after that, proposing to reduce the block size to 300kb and stating that 1mb blocks are already too large.
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:24:54
Why not?
That seems to be a common belief: Once blocks get too big, it's game over, with no chance of reverting.
@_date: 2016-05-21 22:46:59
In terms of efficiency, Bitcoin is way more centralized than the banking system, because everything is stored in the same data structure than everyone has direct access to.
Fiat system has clearing houses and all sorts of intermediaries in between to get a transaction from A to B, especially internationally. A mesh of different IT systems and manual processes creating much more friction than a Bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-05 12:45:32
Unlike Luke, Greg is consistent with his opinion. He thinks a hard fork should be given more time, hence he doesn't support the contentious UASF troll campaign, which could easily lead to a chain split.
"It's one thing to argue that some disruption is strictly needed for
the sake of advancement, it's another to see yourself fit as judge,
jury, and executioner to any that does not jump at your command.
(which is exactly the tone I and at least some others extract from
your advocacy of these changes and similar activity around BIP148). "
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:44:35
I've been loosely following LN developments. Last time I checked, the various competing implementations didn't have a standardised routing algorithm to make it all work.
Apart from that, the economics are a major question mark. The  more hops the more capital needs to be locked and the longer channels have to be open, which leads to centralisation pressure. 
The network of hubs and merchants still has to be created, which doesn't happen in just a few months.
Then also, what people seem to sweet under the carpet is the end user perspective: Having to worry about how much $$ to lock in the right channel for the right time is quite a hassle for users who just want to make a simple payment.
As far as Core goes, most contributions are made by about a dozen people, quite a few of which who signed the HKA but then made no serious effort to push for the 2mb HF, which was supposed to be implemented 12 months ago already but isn't even on the Core roadmap as of today.
@_date: 2017-07-02 12:49:23
That means you support stagnation and no block size increase after Segwit before 2019..

@_date: 2017-07-28 09:28:24


How? Are you referring to the standard Core excuse of them just being a loose bunch of individuals who can't be hold accountable for anything? Even if true, at least those who signed should have pushed for the HF. It's funny how Core devs insist on their freedom, but then demand miners to run their software. And if they don't they label that as an attack or altcoin, or make false promises during closed door meetings (which they seem to condemn as long as they don't serve their purpose).


Yes, and a few things have changed indeed: Transaction fees were skyrocketing for a while, confirmation times bacame unreliable and various businesses stopped using Bitcoin because of that. Coincidentally during the same time, Bitcoin's market dominance plummeted from 88% to 45%. If this didn't emphasize the need for a block size increase, I don't know what else would be. Network effects don't happen in a linear fashion, so we could be facing the same scenario soon again.
How does the Core alternative look like?
* According to Luke, no HF block size increase is necessary in the forseeable future. His preference is to even reduce the block size.
* BlueMatt wants 18-24 months for the activation of a HF, so the last raspberry pie node in Timbuktu has enough time to upgrade.
* Lombrozo wants to spend more time "researching secure activation mechanisms" and "putting as much good stuff and features in a HF as possible, as it should be a once in a moon event". Translation: Scoop creep, further endless stalling.
* Adam Back only wants a HF if there's somehow "overwhelming consensus within the whole community". Translation: Continuing the block size debate for another few years or force the split. Likely continued goal post shifting on his side as far as measuring consensus is concerned.
If it was up to Core devs, there would be no hard fork activating before mid 2019.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:39:37
Jihan did exactly what he said he was gonna do - signal according to the NY agreement.

@_date: 2017-07-05 09:22:52


More like 1.8x, and thereafter you need a hard fork for further block size increases, which you categorically deny?
The Segwit activation trigger was included in December last year, so if anything 7 months.
Bitmain is doing the right thing - signalling Segwit, as soon as a commitment towards a HF block size increase is made. If Core honored the HK agreement, he would have signalled for Segwit already.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:19:22
Well then the decision to move funds into a side chain, open the right channels with right amounts and duration and right partner etc has to be automated somehow without asking the user. And if that automation doesn't work properly, unnecessary payment channels are opened/closed, causing unnecessary fees. Or capital is locked in a side chain longer than the user wants to. More layers will inevitably lead to more complexity.
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:21:40
Yes, when just comparing different PoW system, efficiency isn't the point indeed, because it just comes down to securing the network with capital. You can say though that a PoW system that costs the same but achieves better decentralisation is superior.
When comparing PoW and PoS, it becomes a different story though:
There are already large opportunity costs in Bitcoin, because holders just sit on their coins without productively using them and earning no interest. At the same time, holders have an incentive to support the network consensus. So with PoS, that existing capital and interest of holders can be used to secure the network, and including them in the consensus should improve governance as well.
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:37:07
Not sure what you mean, my point is: Mining decentralisation is far more important for the security of Bitcoin than whether we have 6000 or 4000 full nodes.
So currently, mining is extremely centralised, but Core devs refuse a block size increase because they obsess over the number of full nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:32:04
Thx. So 1mb blocks forever for you then? How did you calculate that 1mb is the perfect block size, and will continue to be despite Moore's and Nielsen's laws?
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:51:07
Not sure - personally I made pretty good financial gains with both Bitcoin, as well as the alt coins that I used for hedging. So I can't complain too much.
Maybe ask someone like Adam Back instead, who was informed about Bitcoin as early as 2008 by Satoshi himself but didn't actually invest before 2013. Or someone like Peter Todd, who by his own account doesn't hold Bitcoin as an investment. It seems like those are the folks you're following.
Apart from that I'll continue to enjoy being on the right side of history: Against the common narrative on this sub, I correctly predicted that Jihan will signal for Segwit as per NY agreement. My next prediction is that the HF of Segwit2x will become the majority chain in 3 months.
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:40:21
It is indeed. Don't be fooled by the sockpuppets here thinking Jihan and businesses like Coinbase or Xapo, who work hard to improve Bitcoin adoption are some sort of villains. The network can easily handle a block size increase, and Core was already supposed to implement one as per the Hongkong agreement which they broke.
@_date: 2016-05-22 11:58:42
I doubt 2mb block size will cause more centralization. Potentially even the opposite as it will benefit non-Chinese miners.
And if pools want to join for a 51% attack they could do so regardless of the block size, same mining header or not.
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:18:55


(Bitmain could have supported this instead of shit that is Bitcoin Unlimited, tell me how this is not power trip)
The BU team shot themselves in the foot with bugginess. At least they already have something running on testnet, and multiple devs are working on it. Good on Johnson to lead the effort with Spoonnet, but I'm sceptic whether that will actually make it into a Core release before Q2 2018. Core still doesn't have a HF target date on their roadmap.
Yep that's a funny one - no code, no BIP assigned. Which isn't surprising, because the author doesn't even recommend his own proposal. It's basically a way of saying: "Look, everyone knows I signed the HK agreement, so I'm just throwing this pseudo proposal out there to save face, which I don't even support myself - so might as well f** it". Meanwhile he proposes to reduce the block size to 300kb. I can't fault Jihan for feeling betrayed by that kind of behavior.


I doubt Lighnting will do much damage 2 years after Segwit activation. Quite a few challenges still to overcome, e.g. in terms of user experience.


Yes, and that can develop quicker than you'd expect. Network effects typically aren't linear. So if that happens, back to high fees again and pushing off users who may not come back.


Could be the case, who knows. Smaller block sizes make spamming more effective :-)

If Segwit2x succeeds, then due to the opposite reason: Because it couples Segwit with a HF block size increase later, hence providing benefits for both sides. Negotiation involves compromises, why should this be different in Bitcoin?


I guess all the miners and businesses like Coinbase, XAPO, Bitpay, Yours etc who signed the NY agreement must be onto a power trip then. Maybe they are - an evil trip to make Bitcoin more user friendly and increase adoption.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:58:49
Segwit will hold about 2x transactions, not 8x. Where did you get that nonsense from?
LN ready to go, sure. Where are the payment hubs, merchants, user friendly apps and the routing algorithm which will make the LN work? It will take several years to eventually gain adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:01:02
Perhaps positive outcomes from the UASF will be:
* Rage quitting from small blockers, so Bitcoin can continue to grow and be more competitive with reasonable block size increases.
* Lessons learned about Bitcoin consensus: Votes from consumer full nodes are pretty much meaningless.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:16:52
Lol. Pretty much nobody is using Segwit on Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:44:35
It's kinda cute how the UASF army delude themselves into thinking they had any power over Jihan. Ever since the Hongkong agreement, Jihan supported Segwit, as long as a commitment to a hard fork block size increase was made. 
Core didn't deliver that hard fork, hence Jihan didn't signal for Segwit. Segwit2x commits to the hard fork, hence Jihan will signal for Segwit. Has nothing to do with the UASF whatsoever. Pretty simple, but hear it from the man himself:
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:06:09
"If miners get what they want and Segwit2x gets passed which includes the 2 MB hard fork, Bitcoin will lead to centralization."
And that's where it breaks down. Neither mining will become more centralised, nor a significant number of full nodes will drop out, let alone full nodes run by businesses which are a lot more important than the raspberry pie full nodes of some hobbyists in Timbuktu with low bandwith.
On the other hand, Bitcoin development will become more decentralised, which currently is a much more significant bottleneck than the 6000 full nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:00:27
Drive space, a huge centralisation factor..
For less than 60 bucks, you can store the blockchain for several years to come, even with Segwit2x. With signature pruning probably more than a decade even.
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:23:54
Not according to some small blockers like Adam Back, who shifts the goal posts from hash rate consensus to full nodes to Twitter votes. Same for Mr Lombrozo, who uses these metrics to conclude that the UASF has overwhelming support..
@_date: 2017-07-05 09:52:25
The days of CPU mining are over, but we gotta hold on to the vision of raspberry pie full nodes as long as possible, if necessary by limiting Bitcoin adoption. /s
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:35:46
Layer 2 solutions like lightning or some retail side chain will be even more centralised.
As for censorship resistance, mining is by far the bigger bottleneck than 6000 vs 3000 full nodes. Or are you arguing that miners wouldn't censor your transaction, but 3000 full nodes would do so, hence spv is insufficient?
Arguably full nodes could even increase with a moderate block size increase that grows the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-07-02 12:58:20
If you want to improve decentralisation, try to decentralise mining. Running more small consumer full nodes has hardly any effect on Bitcoin's security. Growing the ecosystem and enabling actual use cases on the other hand will harden Bitcoin against government intervention, which is IMO the most significant risk. You can't grow the ecosystem by choking capacity way below safety limits though. Different studies have concluded that the block size can be safely increased to at least 10mb without furthering mining centralisation.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:12:45
IMO government intervention is a main risk for Bitcoin, and the best way to counter that would be making it as useful as possible to as many people as possible, as long as mining centralisation doesn't get worse. 1mb blocks forever aren't going to achieve that though, and if Bitcoin is only good for speculation or circumventing governments' printing presses, I wouldn't count on btc friendly hands-off regulation forever.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:20:58
He does, because it delivers the hard fork block size increase after Segwit, which Core refused to prepare even after the Hongkong agreement that some of their most active members signed.
If Core had lived up to the agreement, Jihan would most likely have signalled for Segwit already.
Don't be fooled by the UASF sheep here who see Jihan as a villain who won't signal for Segwit.
If anything Luke is one, because he signed the Hongkong agreement and thereafter even proposed to reduce the block size to 300kb. How disrespectful can one be towards miners.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:35:35
I'd be supportive of UASF if its proponents commit to staying on their chain. Unlikely though, they'll soon crawl back to the NY agreement chain that's going to have majority hashpower.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:11:08
What happens if Bitcoin usage picks up, e.g. in countries like Venezuela or India where Bitcoin can solve some real world problems? Back to square one with high fees and a terrible user experience.
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:39:34
At least thinking about a hybrid PoW/PoS model isn't bad. Deny it if you want, but Bitcoin's PoW is terribly inefficient: Costs several millions in electricity alone each day, yet having very poor decentralisation. Also, users and businesses don't have a say in the consensus.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:43:31
I know those, been part of the Core roadmap for quite some time. I doubt Schnorr sigs will be included in a Core release this year. Thereafter, it needs to be adpopted to take pressure off the network. In the meantime, you can't predict how Bitcoin adoption is gonna develop. In countries like Venezuela or India, Bitcoin could actually solve some real world problems, but once it picks up, high fees will prevent further growth.
This is where Core is fundamentally wrong, they only see the technical side of "wouldn't it be cool if we can keep all raspberry pie full nodes on the network", but don't see the opportunity cost of stalling network growth. Shrinking market domination is just one effect of that. Until a few months ago, Greg liked to point to Bitcoin's network effect, but not anymore so, guess why.
As for Mast, that is far from ready as even Core contributors admit. Same for Lightning.
It has been shown by different researchers that the block size can safely be increased without furthering mining centralisation, so there's no need for further stalling.
@_date: 2016-07-03 11:02:01
If he was such a nice guy, why didn't he run the site as a non-profit at least?
As far as conspiracies goes, it would totally make sense that e.g.
1) Someone blackmails Ross
2) A friendly hacker logs into Ross' account and views the blackmail
3) He decides to do Ross a favour and get the blackmailer whacked, without the knowledge of Ross, because.. Ross is a nice guy, and he wants to do him a favour
Maybe Ross was a libertarian idealist, but it doesn't changed the fact that he benefited from selling hard drugs to addicts, and quite likely tried to order hits. Even if he didn't do the latter and he was a nice guy, there's a good reason why trafficking of hard drugs is illegal and hence prosecuted.
As for the sentence, Ross denied any involvement in Silk Road, so his credibility is about 0. He could have opted to cooperate, but chose not to, so has to live with the consequences of a harsh sentence.

Sure, according to Luke, most Bitcoin transactions are just spam anyway. And as soon as Segwit gets activated, users will race to the Lightning network in no time.  /s
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:51:33
If those who signed the NY agreement stay true to it then 2x should easily become the majority chain, possibly with some Core members rage quitting and Luke creating his 300kb block size alt coin.
We'll see. Unfortunately, not many here seem to realise that the Lightning Network is nothing but vaporware at this stage that will take several years before it will eventually lead to significant scaling benefits. The main anti-HF argument from Core used to be avoiding a chain split, but with the UASF they lead their own argument ad absurdum. They will continue goal post shifting with absurd arguments such as "we have to incentivise a fee market today, because mining might become unprefitable by 2045". Their main goal IMO is incentivising layer 2 solutions, which coincidentally happen to be Blockstream's main products.
@_date: 2016-07-31 06:24:39
Apparently onecoin isn't illegal yet, otherwise how could they advertise their seminars?
Are authorities aware of this?
@_date: 2017-06-25 08:03:33
The main aspects of the debate aren't even that technical. E.g. Johnny from Blockstream suggesting that using Bitcoin is pointless if you don't run your own full node, because you could as well use PayPal or the US dollar instead.
Or Luke, who recently proposed to reduce the block size to 300kb.
It doesn't take a technical genius to find flaws in that argumentation. As a first step, I'd recommend reading about SPV security, then mining centralisation.
@_date: 2016-07-03 08:13:44
Neither, just basic reasoning and being grounded in reality.
But I get ya,  Ross will go down as a libertarian Robin Hood who unselfishly fought for a noble cause (didn't make any money running the site after all..), whereas the only evil person was the corrupt CIA agent.
Maybe visit a drug rehab center to get an impression how safe and easy peasy hard drugs like meth and heroin are..
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:05:42
I wasn't aware that Luke's brilliant 300kb proposal was a "fallback". Even if it was, the whole process would hardly have made  any sense: Luke was supposed to be the Core guy to code the 2mb HF as per HK agreement. Instead of doing that, he delivers a "fallback" HF proposal for a completely undefined use case. In which not completely crazy scenario would we require to reduce the block size to 300kb? Also, the 300kb weren't optional, but the default. Sure he can signal willingness to modify the schedule, but the fact the he chose these crazy default values in the first place undermines his competence.


Yes that happened, however the invalid chain didn't last too long. If miners would just permanently fork to the invalid chain, this would likely damage Bitcoin's price quite significantly. Since miners are long-term invested in Bitcoin, they have a strong incentive to avoid a such scenario.
@_date: 2016-07-03 07:46:48
Hard drugs would do more damage if they were easily accessible legally.
Or are you disputing that meth and heroin are more addictive than alcohol and cause more damage quicker?

I never claimed otherwise. Soft fork vs hard fork isn't the main point here, because what's more important is: How likely can either lead to a _permanent_ chain split? The UASF can quite easily cause that, which some seem to sweep under the carpet. Contentious hard forks are dangerous, yet supporting the UASF, which has much less overall support.
@_date: 2016-07-31 04:55:44

@_date: 2016-07-03 03:11:34
Not easy to say whether alcohol has a net benefit.  But very evident that heroin or christal are a lot more addictive, hence more difficult to consume in a responsible manner. They also cause physical/mental damage much quicker. You're really throwing the baby out with the bathwater here

Numerous studies have concluded that the block size can be increased without affecting mining centralisation. As for "not needed": What sort of fees to you consider acceptable then?

Pretty strange that Jihan supports Segwit2x eh?
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:25:04
No, but if a user wants some influence in the ecosystem and avoid centralisation, he should be mining. Running your own full node on the other hand hardly helps decentralisation, it's pretty much pointless.
So in conclusion, we accept the fact that mining is extremely centralised, but obsess over keeping at least 6000 full nodes and restrict the block size much more than necessary to reach that goal. Talk about out of whack priorities..
With technologies like Bitcoin NG on the other hand, we could increase througput drastically whilst not furthering mining centralisation.

I'd be willing to bet 1 btc he's going to.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:30:05
How would Segwit2x be contentious if it gets the 80% of miners on board, as agreed to in NY?
On the contrary, only 30% miners support Segwit without a HF, and not even many businesses or Core devs support the UASF. Twitter and Reddit users, as well as consumers running full nodes at home are a meaningless metric, it's all about economically relevant actors.
If the UASF should activate before Segwit2x, the very slow block times will make the chain hardly usable so it will die out quickly.
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:39:31
24 months until a hard fork, right. By then Bitcoin's market dominance will be below 10%. It's fascinating how they completely ignore the economic risk of being outcompeted by other cryptos.

@_date: 2017-06-20 09:17:07
A billion users buying coffees with Bitcoin on-chain won't work, hence the need for layer 2 solutions. 
Still doesn't mean we can't increase the block size to an 8mb equivilant without affecting decentralisation in any significant way.
The argument of sandbagging on-chain capacity to incentivise layer 2 solutions is flawed. Not sure if he's suggesting that though, but small blockers probably interpret it that way.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:20:02
Mehh, another UASF sheep. I'm sure miners will be scared to death by the Twitter and rbitcoin trolls, because Nakamoto consensus is totally based on that.
If anything the votes of exchanges and wallets matter, who support the same as miners: Segwit2x, the only sensible solution right now.

Crashing their seminars is entertaining, but won't stop them I suppose
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:48:40

@_date: 2017-06-27 09:09:34
Absolutely, the UASF astroturfing movement could quite easily lead to a chain split.
Apart from that, he's also completely ignoring the opportunity cost of endless stalling, and the fact that Bitcoin's market cap dropped from 88% to around 40% in just a few months.
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:47:24
Miners and businesses like Coinbase or XAPO, who invest several millions in Bitcoin support Segwit2x, but they will surely be frightened by the power of UASF raspberry pie nodes and "UASF" twitter handles.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:23:31
What's your theory exactly?
Asicboost will be disabled first by the Segwit activation of Segwit2x, and the HF that follows 7 weeks later with the sole purpose of doubling the blockweight will then re-enable Asicboost again?
Maybe go back to studying some facts
Jihan Wu of Bitmain: "Asicboost is being repetitively mentioned in the reddit. Btc1 can take a very clear stance to help to ban it if community emotion desire it"
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:02:27
Like I said, Core supports Segwit, but if you stick to Core, say bye-bye to another block size increase (which will most certainly be needed) before 2019.
The only reason people block Segwit is because they want a commitment to a further block size increase, which was already agreed upon in Hongkong, but then Core didn't honour the agreement.
Now the only sensible way out of this stagnation is Segwit2x, which enables Segwit, but also commits to another block size increase thereafter.
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:28:10
Another goal post shifting in the making. Even if Segwit2x is reasonable and if it succeeds in ending the endless debate at least temporarily, it's still bad because it is all about control now.
If Core had implemented the block size increase as per HK agreement, miners and businesses wouldn't switch.
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:38:17
Since a soft fork can result in a chain split it can cause a difficulty adjustment too. But it will happen slowly over time. 
But yes with a hard fork you could just change the difficulty adjustment algorithm itself and reset it to some lower difficulty starting point as part of the code change.
@_date: 2016-07-03 12:34:36
Yes drug fatalities went down in Portugal, because they invested in rehab, as well as decriminalising minor possession so that people with drug problems are more likely to seek help as they don't have to fear prosecution.
That's still a totally different story to downright legalising drug trafficking, so every kid can easily order heroin on the internet. There's a good reason why trafficking is still illegal in Portugal. That being said, it's quite debatable whether non-violent drug charges aren't too harsh in the US, especially against minorities and juvenile offenders.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:40:26
What stagnation from Roger Ver? If it was up to Core we'd have Segwit today and a HF block size increase in 2 years maybe. By then Bitcoin fees would skyrocket, until users switch to something else and Bitcoin becomes irrelevant.

@_date: 2017-07-05 12:25:22


Totally agree, albeit for other reasons. If you mean Bitcoin's survival power, making it as useful as possible to as many people as possible is the best way IMO to protect it from government intervention, which is the main risk I think.
If you mean economic power to counter miners, exchanges and wallets matter, but not some small consumer nodes. If you assume both miners and exchanges are corrupt, you can only fork yourself onto a minority chain with your full node, but not prevent the corruptness from happening. Unless you assume that e.g. 3000 full nodes wouldn't be sufficient, because all 3000 node operators could somehow collude and mine on an invalid chain, so it needs node number 3001  to inform the SPV clients about the fork.


What's your definition of consensus?
According to Peter Todd or Johnny from Blockstream, a hard for should have _at least_ 95% consensus.
Folks like Luke or Adam Back seem to shift to goal post from hash power to node count to Twitter polls and reddit posts.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:23:35
Why should a HF need nearly 100% support?
Don't be fooled by the UASF astroturfers to think Bitmain won't activate Segwit. They will, in combination with the HF. They would have likely activated SW already if Core honored the HK agreement and released that HF code as promised. The anti-Bitmain campaign is just a desperate attempt from Core to get Segwit activated _without_ a guaranteed hard fork block size increase thereafter.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:04:55
Wanna bet that he will signal for Segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:32:10
What a nonsense. Satoshi proposed that there will be large blocks, some data centre nodes, and consumers who only run SPV nodes. Ver wants to follow that vision by increasing blocks, and you accuse him of ruining Satoshis legacy?
Maybe join Luke's party then and decrease the block size to 300kb. It would probably take less than 6 months after that for Bitcoin's market dominance to fall below 10%
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:07:34
Ahh cool. Then there's no rush to raise the block size indeed, because the Lightning network will be adopted by consumers... whenever. If Bitcoin isn't already superseded by then.

Well it's no secret that Core devs and supporters aren't keen to commit to a 2mb HF yet. Not much conspiracy there.
On the other hand, they accuse Jihan of blocking Segwit to keep his Asicboost. So maybe ask them about Bielefeld - especially when Jihan will signal for Segwit. Then all their accusations will suddenly fall flat.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:50:58
Earliest Segwit could have been activated was last December, 6 months ago.
If Jihan would have done that, we wouldn't have another block size increase in the next 18 months, because vaporware products like the Lightning Network are "just around the corner, ready for mass adoption" as some Core members/supporters like to imply.
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:58:00
Main point is, the UASF will likely cause a chain split, unless the NY agreement prevents it by activating Segwit first. Especially a UASF chain with next to no hash power support is almost guaranteed to die.

@_date: 2017-07-05 14:40:35


Which actionable proposal did they provide, with code, block size, activation threshold/time etc specified? Luke's 300kb block size reduction proposal? Or the one from Pieter Wuille with a 17% annual increase per year?


Let's assume that happens:
Core remaining the reference client with no real competition. Segwit gets activated. Lightning will take years to _eventually_ gain some significant adoption, no viable retail side chain is specified either.
In the meantime, Bitcoin adoption in countries like India, Venezuele, perhaps even Japan gains traction.
-&gt; Back to square one with high fees, congestion, and stiffling Bitcoin growth. Block size increase? According to Core devs like Bluematt, that should have 18-24 months lead time. So while the time ticks, Bitcoin will be commonly known as a useless payment network, good only for speculation/digital gold, other cryptos will happily pick up the slack and Bitcoin's market dominance will continue to go South.
To avoid that, and because the pace of Bitcoin's adoption can't be predicted, it is important to add more margin than just Segwit's capacity increase, which can easily be done without causing any noticeable centralisation.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:52:41
Use cases matter, agreed. But unfortunately use cases are moving out of Bitcoin due to high fees.
If Bitcoin tries to be a niche coin for crypto geeks who get a kick out of running their own full node and don't mind high fees then it will lose relevance quickly. Because it caters to a small minority.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:41:43
If you want significantly higher througput without affecting mining decentralisation, but are ok with dropping consumer full nodes then Bitcoin NG is one interesting approach.
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:56:49
Miners also benefit if btc price is rising, and too high fees undermine that as users switch to alts. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:19:00
Indeed. Concern trolling how more hard fork research needs to be done, how it should take 18-24 months to activate so the last full node in Timbuktu has enough time to upgrade etc. But I'm hopeful since the agreement was made to invest in an alternative dev team. Hopefully we'll activate BIP100 next year.
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:27:38
In both cases it comes down to securing the network with capital. 
I see 4 main benefits of PoS:
* Using existing capital: Bitcoin already has significant capital costs, not just because of mining, but also because hodlers just sit on their coins without doing anything with them, hence not earning interest. At the same time, they have an interest in a secure network. With PoS, that existing capital and self-interest of the users can be leveraged to secure the network.
* As more end users can participate in the consensus with PoS, I'd expect it to be more decentralised. That means better security and governance.
* Potentially simpler in the long run. No external factors like Asicboost or the worldwide distribution of electricity costs to consider.
* Saves trees.
As far as pyramid schemes, I don't see how PoS should be more of that than PoW already is. With either, securing the network with capital is the underlying principle, PoW just achieves this in a more roundabout way by requiring an inherently useless investment (mining). Whilst PoS directly locks capital, however without affecting the environment in the process. And since the existing capital and self-interest of end users can be leveraged, I'd expect it to be cheaper overall.
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:23:42


Unless you're trapped in this sub, you'l probably notice that the majority of the ecosystem wants a hard fork block size increase.
Also, Jeff Garzik is leading the effort. Core devs just chip in on a voluntary basis. Aside from Jeff, multiple non-Core devs are involved, and several millions will be invested to build an alternative dev team over the next few years.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:09:31

Besides that, your theory makes total sense. The US gov had to create Silk Road to discredit Bitcoin as they had no legal or other means against it. For the same reason they ran Mt Gox too actually.

In simple terms, it comes down to this:
* The more hops you need to make a payment, the more funds need to be locked up within your payment route.
* The more hops, the longer the channel needs to be open.
* Those 2 factors incentivise using as few hops as possible, which would be the easiest to achieve with a centralised topology consisting of a few large payment hubs.
* Since those hubs have to lock up funds, they will likely charge fees for their services. Again, the more hubs are involved in routing your payment, the more fees would add up. Hence there's an incentive to use the largest payment hubs possible.

Unfortunately, that's exactly the way it is. Adam and quite a few Core devs think a main part of Bitcoin's value proposition is being able to cheaply run a full node, and that it's ok to sacrifice cheap transaction fees for that purpose.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:45:34
With small blocks and high fees Bitcoin's utility for payments will become increasingly poor, and investors don't buy into a coin that's all speculation and no utility.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:38:09


It's pretty convenient to hide behind that notion.
Question: Adam Back and those Core devs who signed the agreement - when did they at least publicly defend it and try to gather support for a 2mb HF? 
I haven't seen any of that, rather the opposite: 
* Luke proposing to _reduce_ the block size to 300kb.
* Adam back still promoting the old Core roadmap with Schnorr and what not, and _perhaps_ a HF 2018/19
* Similar to Bluematt, stating that 18-24 months should be given for the activation of a HF, which is not what the HK agreement stated.
A number of proposals and hard fork research is all nice but won't have any practical impact unless included in a Core release - which was the expectation of the miners. Apparently you guys gave them the impression that this goal was realistic, hence they abstained from running Classic.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:38:07
I doubt so, because both businesses, as well as miners without Asicboost have an incentive to prevent it. And if Jihan refuses to signal for the sole reason of keeping AB in there, he'd unanimously have the whole ecosystem against him. That would already have been the case had Core released the 2mb HF as per HK agreement.
AB is mainly a red herring from Core anyway to push through Segwit by itself without the 2mb HF.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:04:51
Roger Ver doesn't block Segwit per se, only if no commitment to a HF block size increase is made.
If he didn't oppose Core and gave them Segwit by it's own, Core wouldn't commit to a HF within the next 18 months. In other words, accepting Segwit would have lowered fees in the short term, but made them more expensive in the long run due to further stalling of a HF.
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:35:11
Cool, I'd be down for your bet.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:38:26
Almost all miners who support Segwit support the NY agreement.
I'm not aware of any major exchanges or wallets that support the UASF. There are heaps of twitter trolls that do though, as well as users on this "somewhat strictly moderated" forum here.
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:54:21
Certainly. Vitalik was raising that question as well recently:
There has never been a somewhat scientific answer to that. What's pretty sure though is: Bitcoin's decentralisation bottleneck is mining centralisation, not the current number of full nodes. Even if full nodes would go down to 500, I'm not sure which attack scenarios would become much more relevant in practice. Eclipse attacks - you can combat them pretty good by combining local nodes with a large whitelist for SPV nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:14:49
What u trying to say, Segwit2x won't disable Asicboost? That seems to be the main theory here, Jihan the villain blocking Segwit to keep Asicboost.
Hence we gotta return power back to the users and UASF!1

8℅ utilisation charge for buying crypotocurrencies? If true, nobody would use them as currency
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:45:05
With high fees and low capacity, Bitcoin won't become established in the first place. Other coins have successfully hard forked on numerous occasions, and a HF with 80% support isn't nearly as dangerous as people here make it to be.
Crazy enough, many of those same people support the UASF, which can easily result in a chain split.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:57:53
I'm sure he would have gotten a lower sentence if he cooperated from the start, but he chose a tactic of BS and denial. People don't  seem to consider that.

Jihan stalled protocol development, how ironic is that.. let alone for 2 years

I'd say it's not as binary and you can "use bitcoin" in varying degrees.
That's my view as well, but apparently not his.


Offering an unreasonable possibility doesn't add to his credibility, which was my main point. What makes it worse: He signed the HK agreement, and was supposed to be Core's guy to code a HF as per HK agreement. His proposal/possiblity was the exact opposite of that and just adds to his offences towards miners.


What significant SPV restrictions would that be?
Eclipse attacks can be countered with a combo of whitelists and nearby nodes. Miners creating additional coins: Yeah SPV nodes can't detect that, but it's an extremely unlikely attack. Businesses that run full nodes will detect it, and even if you run a consumer full node, you can't do anything meaningful to prevent it anyways. Privacy: A few downsides there, perhaps. But you have various compromises for that, and if privacy is your main concern, Bitcoin isn't the best coin to begin with.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:40:29
Question: Say Segwit activates 1st of August, by what time would you expect Lightning to process as many transactions as Bitcoin today?
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:57:33
Layer 1 doesn't have to be the payment network forever and for everything, but at least until L2 solutions are gaining traction. If you want everyone to run full nodes, you gain like 0.5% security at the most (plenty of ways to make SPV clients secure enough) and increase transaction cost by like 500%. Not a sensible tradeoff I reckon, which will be reflected in a continuously falling Bitcoin market cap.
Compared to other cryptos, Bitcoin is already the most expensive to use, with little functionality and sub par decentralisation. Unnecessarily choking it's capacity to cater for crypto geeks in the first world who like to run full nodes just for the heck of it will turn it into a less relevant niche coin. Just like the days of mining on laptops are over, holding on to the idea of running full nodes on raspberry pies with poor bandwidth means going backwards.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:57:37
Want or not doesn't matter too much, it's all about what he will actually signal for. I'd be willing to bet 1btc he'll signal for Segwit2x, are you too?
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:34:57
BU bugs were a result of xthin, a much more complex technology than the rather small code change required here.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:06:36
Maybe, but like many big blockers and unlike Core, he would be willing to compromise and accept Segwit, if there's a commitment to a further block size increase.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:35:19
It could pretty well be that there will be 2 chains at least for a while, so Segwit2x could be named as btc1 or whatever. Exchanges don't mind a bit of speculation after all. I'm not too fussed about initial naming conventions, but rather how economic support is going to look like.
So how about this one:
"By Oct 21st, a HF block size increase will have happened, and that chain will have at least 60% hash power support, based on double SHA-256 PoW".
PoW is the easiest and most objective criterion to measure, and I don't think miners could afford to mine a chain for a whole month that exchanges and relevant economic actors don't support. How does that sound?
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:14:59
In some way it is - Blockstream CEO Adam back e.g. advised against Segwit2x by referring to the UASF astroturfing movement, claiming that most users don't want to commit to a HF block size increase beyond Segwit yet.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:36:38
Jihan Wu wants exactly what most users and businesses demand too: A block size increase beyond Segwit.
Pretty strange that he supports Segwit2x, which disables his Asicboost, no? Don't be fooled​ by the Core smear campaign against Jihan.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:09:56
Nope the Segwit activation part doesn't require a HF at all, it's vanilla Segwit disabling covert Asicboost. Wanna bet?
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:14:45
Cause creating channels means locking up capital in advance. Hence capital costs.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:36:49
The UASF astroturfing movement finally dies, but it has surely done an amazing service to Bitcoin /s
 If Segwit2x activates, it's all thanks to the economic majority with some common sense and willingness to compromise coming together, against the will from Core/Blockstream/Small blockers
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:38:40
Same as with on-chain centralisation, "stealing money", or double spend attacks by miners aren't the main concern. Censorship resistance is, which would be in jeopardy with centralised layer 2 solutions.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:31:55
So this is the guy that Blockstream, a company with 75mio VC funding, hired as a Chief Strategy Officer?

@_date: 2017-06-05 21:51:13
Running a full node is cool, just like mining btc on your laptop would be. However, Bitcoin has grown out of that. SPV security is good enough, and accepting high fees just so people can run full nodes is silly.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:24:17
You missed the most important tipping point: Segwit2x will lead to Segwit activation by 1st August, hence UASF wouldn't come into effect.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:24:58
Sure. But I don't really see a reason why the economic majority that signed the agreement would bail out.
Lower fees benefit businesses, and more users will lead to higher total transaction fees per block, which benefit miners as well.
But I'd expect to see a large astroturfing campaign from small blockers and some consumer full nodes forking themselves off the network, perhaps even with something like 5% hashpower support.
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:12:04
I do, hence I advise for Segwit2x
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:54:40
I'm already looking forward to the funny justifications from sheep on this sub who claimed Jihan would never signal for Segwit2x. At the same time, those aren't willing to put their money where their mouth is by betting some btc on their claims. It's about time for the adoption of prediction markets..
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:21:11
Which places? Portugal?
Drug trafficking is still illegal there, just the possession of small amounts isn't. The number of drug fatalities decreased there, but they also increased their investment in health care, particularly in the area of drug rehab.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:28:27
So you're suggesting a block size increase may not be needed after Segwit? Disagree. As Bitcoin adoption picks up, the Segwit increase won't be enough to keep fees down. It will also take a few months for Segwit to increase throughput to 1.5x, let alone 1.8x. 
Why no incentive to mine Segwit blocks? Overall fees per block will become higher, which miners care about.
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:15:19
Sure, most "big blockers" would agree that LN and Sidechains are useful technologies that will find their place. At the same time they are not ready yet, have their own challenges in terms of security and usability, and there would be no harm caused by a moderate block size increase.
Especially in countries like Venezuela or India Bitcoin could deliver real-world value outside of speculation/digital gold, but with the current small block strategy, Bitcoin is made increasingly useless as a payment network for no plausible reason.
Instead it's being optimised for some crypto geeks in the first world who enjoy running their own full node, although there's no need to do so.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:50:46
Such nonsense. Jihan wants a block size increase beyond Segwit, as already agreed upon in HK. He'd support Core if they delivered that, however they don't.
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:57:25
Being blocked from accessing the network can happen already due to Bitcoin's extreme mining centralisation. Running your own fullnode doesn't do anything to prevent that compared to an SPV node.
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:08:32
Lightning network = now? It will take several years to eventually gain adoption.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:44:22


Ehm nope, the HF won't re-enable Asicboost. I was merely trying to understand why you'd conclude that Segwit2x doesn't disable Asicboost, but you gave the answer yourself:


Strong opinions but no clue about the actual technicalities. At least you're honest about it.
It's funny how rbtc used to be the sub of lower technical quality but the tide is shifting.
UASF won't happen anyway since Segwit2x will likely lead to Segwit activation before. Though I wouldn't mind if the UASF sheep fork themselves onto a minority chain with 4% hash power support and epic long confirmation times in their noble quest to "return power back to the users and fight the evil mining cartel".
