Seems possible that the judge threw out Mark's proposal because it was unreasonable. But a new injection of capital makes it much more reasonable.
EDIT: Also note that this agreement was mediated by a standing US Bankruptcy Judge. Sure he's not a Japanese judge, but I think it lends credence to the idea that this is a legal possibility. Surely they considered Japan's role in the action.

The tooltip says "we fixed your ad". Did you promote this post on your page? Then it would make more sense that Facebook would refuse to enable that.

I've been trying to pitch my developer friends on this basic concept for months. If you need any front end (Jquery/web design etc) help, let me know.

Noooo now I'm part of the pyramid!

Dogecoin is a pyramid scam that will collapse. Just like all the other altcoins. Power to those that profit on the faith of others, but I feel bad for the ones left after to pick up the check.

False. The market cap of Gold is measured in trillions, market cap of bitcoin is 18b.

It's commonly used in the inverse like this.
As in, increasing levels of insanity vs genius.

no, the inverse. its peak insanity.

yea dude, and ride the rest out. You're living the dream, I hope you spend it well.

You've only gone through half the strategy. After you make that 20% gain, you wait until the difference goes down (which it inevitably will), then buy bitcoins on Gox and send them back to stamp or coinbase (where you can cash out) at a 10% loss. So you just net a 8% gain without any risk. And you can recycle that gain into the same strategy without ever cashing out by waiting for the difference to go up again.

you've got to read the flow chart again. I'm never transfering any cash. The only assets transferred are bitcoins. Assets are stored for the long term as USD credit on the exchange accounts.

Moneyyyyyyyy. I hope you all bought at 875 while you could. It's about to jump back to 1,100.

No thats the key factor in this method (And why it's not just run-of-the-mill arbitrage like people seem to be assuming). You are always holding your money in the exchange account, until prices become more equal. This means you only ever have to transfer bitcoins, which is much much faster.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:40:49
I'm pretty sure with this method, volatility and liquidity are not factors. Exchange lag is definitely a problem, but perhaps you could account for that by only trading during low volumes.

I think the real economics term is equilibrium. But when I said 'even' I meant when the various markets share a common price (ie all markets selling bitcoins for $300) 'uneven' is when the various markets are set at different prices (ie one is selling for $280 another for $310, at the same time)
Like right at this moment, Mt. Gox is at $695 and campBX is at $640, so those markets would be 'uneven' by that definition. There's no hindsight or prediction involved.

Does this mean bitcoin isn't completely decentralized?
Isn't the ability to update a vulnerability to attack?
