To be fair, the only way to for this to be 100% trustless is if you know software coding and can either write the wallet software yourself, or evaluate the open source code yourself.

I would absolutely bet my house on that. The odds of not flipping one heads on 20 flips is practically zero. Hell, the odds of flipping all tails in 10 flips is less than 1%.   
The [binomial distribution]( formula is how you calculate that or, you could check out this [coin flip calculator]( If you have it calculate 1 heads and 19 tails, it will just give you 0 because the fraction is so small.

Do you own that website? Do you make money when people subscribe?   
If not, can you give us a recap of the info that you learned there?
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:44:08
is\*   
But also I disagree.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:48:56
If you need the house next year more than you need potential returns in 5+ years, then yes, you might want to reconsider.

Do you think bitcoin will help stagnant wages and and taxes?
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:13:41
Why do you think bitcoin is going to be the solution to the global debt problem?
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:18:36
Why do you predict that?

Look at this clever comment that should be tipped!

I wish I could tell you. If you find one, let me know. Every crypto related sub reddit seems to be a shitting match of some sort
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:15:29
If you didn't assume that you were going to have to pay taxes on bitcoin, you need to be better informed. Technically, you're supposed to pay taxes on anything you sell for a profit.
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:51:39
You can find those, just look for the posts that are downvoted to hell and have comments that talk about the BIG BAD EVILLLLL INFLATION, and DIRTY DISGUSTING FIAT MONEY.
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:59:24
Oh okay

Alexia doesn't record or send your voice to Amazon until you say "Alexa".
Now yes, the mic is on and could Amazon or even a 3rd party be listening without you knowing? Sure. But the odds that someone was listening to your specific device, instead of one of the other 100 million that have been sold, at the exact time you said your seed phrase is so insignificantly small, I wouldn't worry about it.
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:37:05
Just so you know, CashApp will only let you buy $10k per week.
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:50:32
Why even bother asking here. This place isn't for discussion, it's an echo-chamber meant to make post-college grads feel good about their edgy decision to put their savings into bitcoin.   
Any critical question will be shot down without any sources or discussion (eg.see most comments here already).
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:15:13
what the hell is a glammor koin?
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:21:16
I really like CashApp. I only hold about $100-300 worth of BTC at a time in there, but I like the ability to quickly sell and then spend right out of the CashApp if I need to. Everything else I move into a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-01 12:57:00
I’ll upvote you for being fun and having a sense of humor about disagreeing with me! (Because that’s a rarity on reddit nowadays)
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:15:46
I like it. I want it to always stay just like that, too. Orange and drawn with a mouse in MS Paint.

And he also bought it way overpriced (assuming he did this recently)
@_date: 2019-10-01 05:19:22
Why don’t you like CashApp?
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:05:42
I don't think it's a physical ignition key, its a fob but it still requires you to insert it. I would guess this is a  2008-ish 3 series, I used to have one that was similar. And honestly, it drove me nuts that I still had to insert the fob into the dash to star the car.
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:40:52

Why do you see bitcoin treated the same way as gold?

I pretty much agree with you, but because you started off with “I’m prepared for the downvotes”, I’m downvoting you.

HOW DARE YOU imply anything that suggests that bitcoin isn't the all mighty all powerful best thing to ever be invented and that something else could possibly work better for something at all!   
get out of her you Russian bot, go back over to dirty r/btc
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:25:07
If it’s something you’re planning to use as a financial tool, yes, you should go out of the way to learn about the laws regarding it, especially something as simple as inquiring about taxes on financial gains. That’s pretty much step 
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:34:52
But they require ID if you want to withdraw BTC and I imagine they won't approve him to do so when they see he's under 18.
@_date: 2019-10-01 05:36:25
CashApp allows you to withdraw the bitcoin you buy to any wallet
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:03:51
This is the best shit post I’ve ever seen ������
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:01:23
I'd like to think that if someone was informed enough on how to buy bitcoin and use a wallet to send money, they probably aren't dumb enough to fall for this.
@_date: 2019-06-16 03:04:15
Oh dear lord...

You know son, funny thing about regret is it's better to regret something you have done than to regret something you haven't done. Oh and by the way, if you see your mom this weekend, besure to tell her....  
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:06:22
Although you are required to share your ID to withdraw the Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:49:39
And everyone who’s not scamming says they are.

What makes you say that?
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:36:00
You know, I went through your post history to try to find something else you were wrong about just so I could make a snarky comment, but I didn't find anything. In fact, the only prediction you made was about the BCH pop in May and that turned out to be true, so good for you!  
Here's to hoping you're right again.
@_date: 2019-06-06 15:05:07
Lol that's fair.

Couldn’t you say the same thing about people who write articles that are bullish on BTC?
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:59:19
Right, he's just like "I'm so rich, that $9 billion is chump change to me, so fuck it"
@_date: 2019-06-12 14:44:12
Why does bragging about money = doesnt know how to secure bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:09:03
Nope, withdrawing to a wallet is what requires an ID. I don’t remember if you need an ID to sell
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:20:10
It’s gone over $8k and dropped back below 4 times in the last month, so no I’m not very confident this will be the last time.

When you get it, go to [Trezor.io]( to set it up before you even open the box. The set-up process will walk you through every step to safely set it up, including how to inspect the packaging to make sure it hasn't been tampered with.
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:35:05
This was written 2 weeks ago right when the price spiked to around $9k. Do you think the author anticipated it to fall back to $7800?
@_date: 2019-10-01 05:49:58
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:57:07
I mean, even at that rate of growth, you're looking at a quarter mil, not 1MM.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:55:11
or a cucklord
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:29:00
Yeah that’s not have market cap works at all
@_date: 2019-06-08 04:23:27
How’d that strategy work out?
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:46:49
This isn't "psycology", this is wishful speculation.
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:09:50
I have the Trezor One and am happy with the security features, but yeah, the Trezor T is even better.  Mine was on sale for $40 and I couldn’t afford the T at the time. 
Yes, get the steel wallet. Keep your seed phrase saw from fire, flood, etc. That said, I got the ColdTi wallet and letter stamps and saved $30.
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:48:19
Oh, right, duh. Yeah for some reason I read what you wrote backwards. Like there aren't enough millionaires to buy one bitcoin. Whoops!
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:05:45
I watched that twice and can’t tell if it’s satire or not.
@_date: 2019-06-09 16:58:45
Not the same.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:26:23
No. 99% of people in this echo chamber are high on hopium while “speculating” on the market. 
“Fiat money is set to crash and burn any minute now and we will all take our place at the top of the new-bitcoin world order!”
“What makes you think that”
“Uhhhh I saw a meme and some charts with fancy lines going from bottom left to top right on this sub so it must be true”
@_date: 2019-06-11 04:15:14
@_date: 2019-06-20 23:59:06
I’ll give you 7 units of money for it.
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:06:44
Do you think the stock market will cease to exist if the world turns to bitcoin and ditches fiat all together?
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:06:39
No one says that
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:42:09
Ain’t nothing but a heaarrrrtache
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:59:26
Well then what’s the point in this if you plan on never using it?
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:18:59
I love the "trends indicate that..." arguments as if enough time has passed in the last decade since Bitcoin was established as a brand new type of currency. Like becuase we've seen it go up from the start, we can 100% assume its always going to go up. And how dare I assume that there's a chance that it could \*gasp\* stabilize with the USD at some point.
@_date: 2019-06-13 04:39:59
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:23:11
Yeah....i think it was just a joke.
@_date: 2019-12-12 05:05:48
Yeah if instead of thinking logically you just say bad things about banks, fiat, evil government, etc., that’d be great...
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:51:24
And when are you going to accept bitcoin as payment?
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:14:28
You're quite the deep thinker.
@_date: 2019-09-03 12:55:58
Sell BTC in Robinhood, then immediately use funds from your savings acct to buy on another exchange. Replace the funds in your savings acct one week later.
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:54:21
Do more with it like more bushiness are accepting Etherium than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:37:28
How is Etherium centralized? Honestly curious, I have absolutely no idea how any of the alts work.
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:35:24
Why is it superior? Not trying to be a dick, just generally curious as I haven't heard of it.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:00:22
:( I hate that you were wrong
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:40:55
Did you say "alts"?!!!!!!!!!!! How dare you mention that evil one-syllable word on this sub!  Prepare yourself for well deserved downvotes, loser!

Real helpful.... Never heard this one before.....
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:58:15
Why do you have that as your bottom?
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:51:30
What the heck am I looking at? I don't comprehend this at all.
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:35:21
I'm not saying that Buffet is wrong or right, but to assume that the guy is bearish on bitcoin because of his investments is silly. If he really thought bitcoin had potential he would buy some. I'ts not some conspiracy to bring us down.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:50:29


What? Why would we not ask you that?
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:25:48
Whales own most of every market? What?
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:44:28
were you at least able to withdraw your coins or sell them and withdraw the cash? They cant just seize your assets, can they?
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:53:24
How much bitcoin do you want to bet that isn’t true?
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:50:33
Doesn’t Robinhood not let you withdraw your coins though?
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:49:15
Or he has no idea what he's talking about, is making a total guess, and is just hoping it works out so he can come back here and be like "look i told you so I'm so smart!"
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:36:32

@_date: 2019-05-18 02:44:08
I agree that he could be biased, but it’s silly to think he’s trying to take down bitcoin because he’s afraid of it.
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:42:25
Buy 50 euro a couple times a month. Forget you invested it. See where you are at when bitcoing becomes a widely accepted world currency in 10-30 years
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:19:59
Why can't you explain how you came to this conclusion?
