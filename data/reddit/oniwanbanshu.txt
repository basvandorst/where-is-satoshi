Not true.  Any version of Bitcoin core allows off-chain 'account' to 'account' transaction within a wallet.  It doesn't make any sense to have inter-wallet moves recorded in the blockchain.  Why be surprised that any service does this for performance reasons if nothing else?  Unless of course, you take an anti-privacy stance like the article.

is stll alive?  i haven't seen anything there in ages, almost forgot about it!

You could securely send the transaction to a public libbitcoin server (using Tor if you'd like), which then broadcasts it to the p2p network:
UPDATE: Forgot to link, if you already have the transaction, all you need is the command line bx tool to do this.  See this document:
In particular, the only relevant step would be the "bx send-tx" command.

Thanks for the response.  I didn't realize you had answered parts of my question until a while after I posted, as I only skimmed the threads before posting.
I'm appreciative of all efforts to increase privacy, I'm just skeptical that this is effective.  I'm not aware of the simple blacklisting technique of just looking back a few hops, and while it's great that you intend to stay a step ahead, this is a near trivial hurdle to overcome, so greater measures will be required very soon.
Compared to something like joinmarket (a marketplace for coinjoins), I don't think this is even close in terms of privacy/fungibility.  I just think users should be loudly warned that they can't trust it will actually increase their privacy, particularly if/when it matters.

From a privacy/fungibility perspective, can you explain how this actually helps?  If for example, I know what 'Richochet' transactions look like (i.e. a string of 5 transactions with an easily identifiable trail of 1 input to 1 output txs), why wouldn't I just quietly not say anything and in my analysis treat the 'final' endpoint as a single hop?  There's really no obfuscation going on here.  Shuffling between your own addresses on chain with a non-standard transaction (most wallets don't generate transactions with 1 input and 1 output, thus it's more or less a watermarked pattern) doesn't actually increase privacy.  It does cost fees however and bloat the blockchain.  What am I missing?
EDIT: It's true that intermediate txs being in a separate HD wallet (assuming no addresses are ever re-used) helps when you finally redeem the coins in another, as there's a complete separation of inputs from that point forward ... but again, isn't the pattern to look for in analysis a bit obvious since it's advertised?

Great to hear there's a mixing solution in the works, and thanks for your hard work in the space!

Show me a regular stream of blocks that took 2 hours to confirm.  If you find an occasional one and are complaining, I think you misunderstand how the 'blockchain' works.
If you're trolling about having to pay a fee, see my comment above.
