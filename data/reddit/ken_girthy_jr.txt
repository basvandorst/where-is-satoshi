This is bad advise when using a credit card.  Unless you have the cash to cover the payment, you'll end up loosing profits to CC interest.

There is a crypto bubble forming, not a bitcoin bubble.  The market will not support thousands of different coins that serve the same purpose.  
When it pops I don't think it will be as severe as other markets have seen, due to the distributed nature.  In the end this will be good for the surviving coins.

This is an oversimplification, but Crypto is traded against 3 things: USD, USDT, BTC.  When one of these has a significant supply influx the others become relatively more valuable due to the relative scarcity.  At least in the short term.

The real question is, 8k BTC or sub 1k BCH first?
edit: it was BCH, just dropped below 1k when BTC was at 7950

Did you read the article?  It says to avoid crypto because they don't pay dividends.
