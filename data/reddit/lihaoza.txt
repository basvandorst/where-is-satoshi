I think there are more than enough. It is a billion dollar industry after all. Additionally I believe BTC could actually bring in new consumers with the fact that they don't have to worry about being overcharged and/or the ability to maintain anonymity.

What about an open source exchange built off of a system similar to blockchain? When you want to make a trade it sends over your encrypted wallet to be decrrypted client side and then lets you make the exchange.

People keep a certain amount of money in their checking account earning 0% interest. This is because this is the most liquid form of money. This money is used to pay credit card bills. Inflation will inevitably cause this money to be worth less over time. Bitcoins will not be subject to this inflation. If everything in BTC remains constant each BTC will still be worth more over time. In fact even most savings accounts do not keep up with inflation these days. 
If I normally keep $3000 in my checking account for spending maybe now I want to keep $2700 in my checking account and $300 in BTC. I realize there is a volatility risk with regard to that $300 but assuming BTC is able to mature (i) volatility will decrease and (ii) the ability to keep non-inflationary cash could outweigh the risks associated with volatility. 
This plus all the other reason people have listed.

I think in the end it is not about whether or not you would spend your hoard even if you are a die hard hoarder. If the options are there to actually spend mBTC and mBTC makes the transaction easier the reasonable thing to do is just go out and buy more mBTC.
For example if I had a hoard of 1000 mBTC and I wanted to keep that as an investment for the long term but I realized that at Starbucks I could spend mBTC more easily than my credit card and/or I wanted to support mBTC I could still not touch my hoard. Instead I would just go buy another $100 worth of mBTC (money I would spend on coffee anyway) and just spend that. I am not hurting my investment because I would not have gone out and bought that extra $100 worth of mBTC were it not for the Starbucks option because that is not my investment budget, it is my coffee budget. The only difference is I am converting it into mBTC before spending it. If Starbucks did not accept mBTC then I would just not convert that $100. 
Basically what I am trying to say is that the use of mBTC as both an investment and also a more functional currency can coexist without any problems.

Why do people think it is a scam?
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:58:13
My answer is that the problem you are addressing is actually a minor hurdle because (1) the tax implications are still not completely clear and (2) even under the worse case scenario the problem is an easy fix with third party software which will arise when the need arises. As far as I can tell there is no issue now. Has there been a flood of IRS audits and penalties of BTC purchases that I am not aware of? 
As for my second paragraph, I don't think you understood it. It has nothing to do with credit card fees. My point is that keeping money in USD cash will inevitably cause that money to lost significant value through inflation. The solution to that problem is keeping the money in something resistant to inflation, like gold. The problem with keeping money in gold is that you can't spend gold. But you can spend BTC. What I was saying is that hypothetically, if throughout my lifetime I had kept all of the money in my checking account as gold instead of USD I would be a lot wealthier today because while the USD has depreciated severely, gold has appreciated. However, I obviously was not able to take that option because I can't spend gold anywhere and I needed a more liquid more of money for my checking account. With BTC I can spend it.

They would outlaw Bitcoin if they were trying to take it down. But I think OP's question is whether the Chinese government would try and compete in that space and whether it would be successful. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:05:30
Capital gains should not really stop you from spending. Capital gains just means you made money. Even if the government takes their 15% cut you are still 85% better off than if you held cash.

My mode of argument is that the problem is extremely easy to take care of and the only reason it has not happened is because it is not a problem. 
The buying power of a USD has decreased by 99% over the last 100 years. The buying power of gold has stayed constant. Which one is the bubble again?

I am not sure if you completely understood the reasoning behind my original post. 
What if you had a program that every time you spent BTC it would automatically go out and buy up the same amount in BTC at the current market price to replace those spent BTC? If you buy 1 mBTC worth of coffee the program goes out and buys an additional 1 mBTC on the open market and puts it into your wallet. There would never be any regret to spending the BTC because it would always gets replaced. In the pizza example the program would have just gone out and bought another $41 worth of BTC and Laszlo Hanyecz would have been no better or worse off EXCEPT he still got the benefit of using BTC as a currency. The point is you don't need a program. Just do it yourself.

My issue was resolved. I was able to start the transfer last night and although the same thing happened to be with regard to it not making it to the blockchain right away I checked again this morning and the coins are where they should be. Good luck to everyone else.

That is assuming that the third party wallet just doesn't do all of this for you automatically. Additionally it would be pretty easy to "import" the addresses you use for transactions and have a third party program analyze the public ledger and tell you the capital gains and losses after the fact. 
And the amount you are saving over credit is not trivial. If all of the amount of cash that I had kept in my savings account over the years had instead been invested in gold I would be a lot better off financially.

Correct me if I am wrong but I thought the implied value is what the price should be today. 
Like if you expect BTC to achieve 1% market penetration in 10 years, the "fair price" today should be $1041.

But are there any legitimate arguments that it is a scam? Or is it comparable to calling BTC a ponzi scheme (I full acknowledge there are legitimate criticisms to BTC but I think just yelling "ponzi scheme!!!" is not one of them) just because they don't understand it? 
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:27:32
Philosophically I think the buyer should always be the one that takes the volatility risk with regard to refunds and that this should be clearly stated in the terms of purchase.
This is because the buyer is the one in complete control of the refund. A seller can never force a buyer to refund but a buyer can refund any time within the 30 days. Doing it the other way could potentially let the buyer game the system by refunding only because the price of BTC dropped. It is true that the merchant can hedge against this but then it forces them to always convert to fiat.
