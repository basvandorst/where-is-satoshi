For real? I bet it will be soon, for crypto. Robinhood is a stock trading app, so there's probably some laws stopping it right now. 
If the whole world could buy American stocks. It might get a little nuts.

How's about you guys gust give me some bitcoin and I'll go buy some Molly to treat my PTSD...
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:36:14
I swear I have been here once before. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:15:32
Thanks. Pretty much what I thought. I've seen websites that show the currencies volume, but I never trust how accurate they are.

Would putting everything into Bitcoin cash be an easy way to double up?
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:16:36
I want you on my panel. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:08:21
I did $3k around 18k I feel for you. Let's hope for a Christmas mirical. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:07:37
Do you think OP just wants attention?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:49:04
All the apps in here are portfolio apps. There really aren't any apps that work as a wallet and a portfolio?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:53:08
I can't use Google right now and all I have is a dictionary from 1994. 
I will assume it means the same thing as "interstellar" 
We're  going to the moon, r/bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:06:22
Listen. There's so much blockchain but at the same time there's not much to go around. I think that all blockchain will merge together, and something else will be built onto it. I'm talking 100 years though. I'm just hoping to make out in the next 5 years. If I can sell my stuff on coinbase for a profit or pay for things with the stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:34:08
If I look at the price later this week
and the price is at its at $4k,
I'm going to gnaw your penis off. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:33:27
I need someone to shoot me in the head with a crossbow. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:48:13
It's not an app though, is it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:54:50
I finally bought bitcoin on coinbase. I should probably kill myself now, so I don't have to watch thousands more of my dollars disappear. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:52:29
Sounds like it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:25:21
So everyone kept saying hold buy hold buy so finally I bought $1000 in each currency on Coinbase. But then this morning Bitcoin cash is there. I don't even know what that is. Guess my initial gut feeling was right and I shouldn't have even looked on this subreddit in the first place. 
What did coinbase even do wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:46:42
You should study. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:51:58
It's enjoyable. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:29:45
I would die immediatly if I had $1million.
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:00:32
Yes you owe nine millionths bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-08-19 12:42:12
The guy who sold it to you has to buy it back for the same price bitcoin code.

A serrated Nike checkmark...
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:48:50
I'm curious what will happen to the price when the fork happens. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:49:14
A big thing was when Tesla won the bid to run the world fair in new York using AC electric while Edison lost the bid to use DC at the world fair. Edison completely lost it after that. I'm pretty sure Edison electrocuted several animals in public. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 16:47:59
Do it faster slow poke. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:46:52
He did. Started electrocuting animals on times square. 
It's funny that in Elementary school they teach you about Edison as if he was a great inventor and nice guy. Turns out he was an asshat and the foreigner Tesla, who the american school system doesn't want to teach about, was the real backbone behind our electric world.

So much fluxuation is not good.

Buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:05:45
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:36:54
Should I hold my .1?
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:08:45
What are people doing with Bitcoins besides holding them? It only has a dollar value behind it. 
I can't buy groceries with it. I can't pay any bills with it.  Bitcoins best hope is that a government does regulate it (in that country) then people will be able to pay bills and buy groceries. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:28:18
That's very few. I just searched that there are 5,000,000,000,000 US dollars.... thats insane!
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:04:11
Let's start posting these memes every $1 instead of every $100.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:29:23
That makes it's less like a curency and more like a stock. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:46:55
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:49:59
Probably going to drop to $5000 soon or maybe even $3000. Then it will stay until Germany starts using Bitcoin as a regular currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:52:44
He should have put his illegal money into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:19:53
Listen man. I got .1 bitcoin. What do I do?
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:05:12
I already own a Lamborghini, I need to keep paying the insurance. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:23:02
Like I wonder if a country like the US, or another country with a close population, started using only bitcoin, with its volume, how much would 1 bitcoin be?
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:35:43
What's a node?
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:15:13
Thad that's really good. I bought btc then bought drugs and sold the drugs. That was a bad idea, I should have held.
But who knows man? If there's only 30,000,000 of them. It could be big one day. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:30:32
I exchange stocks for USD. So I don't need gift cards. Just a debit card. 
Oh but with BTC the company selling the gift card is just exchanging the bitcoin for a card with USD on it, all in one transaction!
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:17:30
I will split my soul in two.

I realize that if someone calls me on the phone or texts me or sends me an email I should not trust it and I shake alone on my bathroom floor. The safety is what is hood. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:50:04
But someone takes all the good K-cups the first day. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:30:04
I wonder why it would be this way. Are their region locks on the App itself? Or signing up with an account?
I was able to use Robinhood on my phone while I was in Japan over Christmas.  It was like 9pm there, when markets opened. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:32:43
O hope we get wiped out this week. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:18:14
I'm completely dead inside but... 
heaheahea great post OP. Gosh DBZ is the best. I sure do hope the price of BTC goes back to $18,000 where I can break even.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:42:12
Hold out this year and maybe 2019 will adjust and well be rich. No point selling.

Just hold hope  hone your skills and hop on to the next new band wagon and get out fast or hold forever.

They will probably come out with a Robinhood Crypto App for the rest of the world.
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:28:29
-_- mrw the government wants data more than drugs. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:33:20
Every spick I say "eugghhh should I sell?" I think my anxiety is to night to trade stocks or currency. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 12:31:28
It's like no one cares about riches anymore. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:17:03
I keep waiting for BTC to get posted to premature celebration. I own 1 Bitcoin. If it goes up to $10k, Great. If it falls to $.10, great.
Someone was trying to explain to me that with the way banks and the US treasury are set up... It's already blockcain technology. 
I don't care either way. All I want, is to see everyone as sad as I am.

I'm not convinced that more Bitcoins can't be added to the chain.
