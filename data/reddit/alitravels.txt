Ty for the detailed answer mate. &lt;3
Really appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-08-24 09:07:13
Wouldn't this be a good thing for bitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:23:44
so if i leave like 5$ on the account i'm safe ? I'm gonna trade around a grand within 30 mins or something so not peak time.
@_date: 2019-08-20 10:05:46
Hey mate. Would you be able to link me a video or a book that explains what you're talking about? I'm not that well informed.
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:59:31
yeah the money is on my wallet and i'm sending it to his wallet. My account is on blockchain
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:14:29
Yeah but is it okay to put the whole amount ? Lets say i have 1000$ is it safe to send all the 1000 or should i leave some on my wallet for the transaction fees or price fluctuation

Oh no i mean i could google gamblkng bitcoin and im dure i ll get thousands lf results. Im asking if theres a well developped and known site out there. Not gonna gamble on a randoms website haha :p
@_date: 2019-08-16 00:07:01
Glad to hear haha. I'm selling 75% of my btc tomorrow but i came on here and read through some posts and some people make it seem like anyday now blockchain is gonna fuck up or scam us hahah. Just started panicking out of nowhere. How do you like the trezor ? How long did it take to ship ? What happens if you lose it ?
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:17:55
Im talking coinflip games mate or something. Im not looking for card games. Those r not 50 50 but coinflips are. And ig u mean the percentage that u pay them off each coinflip then yeah. 49.5 50
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:26:39
What are you talking about ?
@_date: 2019-08-17 16:54:02
Oh oh all right and what do you think the percentage of that is would you know
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:33:16
Can anyone explain to me why they do it like this ? Like why don't they just make atms that charge a minimum amount and give you fair exchange rates? Wouldn't that boost bitcoin's popularity ? Just integrate easy and cheap ways for us to  deposit and withdraw our money and more people will use this and more countries will adopt the BTC ATMS

Oh  people said transfer  fees were expensive i sent 1600$ to someone and it was only 0.27$ fee to send that from wallet to wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:34:30
can anyone explain what this means
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:56:36
It went from 18K unconfirmed transactions to 14K though sooo maybe soon haha. It said an hour + its been 1H:30. Hopefully its fine by tomorrow or else i'll have to figure out if its eeven possible to pay extra fees on a transaction that's already sent on blockchain.
@_date: 2019-08-24 09:11:32
Can you tell us the fees ? You paid 50 euros but how much did you actually get on your account ?
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:19:00

@_date: 2019-08-21 22:50:13

@_date: 2019-08-27 14:58:52
i'm trading from blockchain to another wallet address not quite sure yet what it is.
@_date: 2019-08-17 16:53:04
Oh all right and like what do you think the percentage of that is
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:32:09
Thats why its called gambling right ? im not gonnq gamble all of it lol just a portion for fun 
Its just that ur calling me bad names mate and thats kinda disrespectful not sure what i did to u but thats not right. Just on here looking for guidance.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:01:01
But cant u like cancel pending transactions with that?
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:41:01
So do i create a new address on electrum and then just send the money from blockchain to my new electrum address ? Can y ourecommend what type of security i should create. Two step authentification , standard , 3 keys i'm so confused i'm sorry.
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:43:05
Oh so this necer happend before ? What kind of rule is this ? Set by btc algorithm ?
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:19:56
is electrum safe ?
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:54:19
No don't worry mate i didn't get scammd. Just sold it for reeal like cash cause i needed it. I uhmm. I did this before and last time the default fees worked. Now i think i have very low fees and its probably going to take a long time for him to receive it... :/ oh well... I read somwheere that you can pay extra for the minors so that your transaction goes up the ladder ? Would you know how to do that on blockchain ? I'm only paying Fee per byte	14 sat/B and i googled it and someone got stuck with 20 sat a byte haha. So yeah would you know how to pay more fees on that particular transaction now that its pending ? :)
@_date: 2019-08-16 07:50:37
Other than the price. It would take a long time for me to acquire it. Long story.
@_date: 2019-08-27 12:45:13
Whats reward halving
@_date: 2019-08-16 13:00:38
I'm sorry can you explain a bit ? :)
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:58:10
I have a question. U say btc is a safe haven asset for the people ? How so ? The btc price is in fiat currency. If the follzr crashes so will bitcoin. Btc only becomes a safe haven if its globally adopted and pizza is priced at 0.001 btc and not 10 usd. Gold is valuable on its own since its globally adopted. If fiat currency crashes. Gold.will still hold its value. Not sure about cryptocurrency
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:51:04
How do u survive then
@_date: 2019-09-10 08:00:45
Not sure about the best but i think some.of the popular ones r blockchain and coinbase
