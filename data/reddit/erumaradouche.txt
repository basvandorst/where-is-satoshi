You can. The fee is the portion above 12.5 BTC that goes to the miner. There is no need to store more data in the blockchain to see this information.

Its not clear but he has had issues with firearms in the past and there was an unregistered crossbow in the house.
This seems more related to that then to software development.

Satoshi referred to satoshi's as cents in v0.3 and earlier of the core client, which would make bits the main unit.
So it seems like Satoshi would also have preferred bits.

No, Canada is not under the queen's jurisdiction.
The only influence the queen has on Canada anymore is that she appears on some Canadian coins.

- Because the demand for it is low, it wasn't used very much overall.
- Maintaining an app that securely stores people's cash requires non trivial effort.
- It was a constant battle to unban it from many subreddits that would ban the bot due to spam and a dislike from many non bitcoiners in those subreddits.

This thread is about someone who put 50 BTC as ***miner fees***. Not as part of the amount he wanted to send to some address, but as the part that goes to the miner as fees.

Actually he had problems with firearms that were expected to be unregistered but turned out to be registered.
He also had an unregistered crossbow.

If he didn't want to get shot he should have said sorry.

It appears to me that an idea Satoshi had was to use 100M units = 1 bitcoin so that we could one day write things like "4321.43 bits". (Obviously he didn't coin the term bits though.)
I remember in v0.3 of the core client he actually referred to the idea of "cents".
I don't take Satoshi's code as gospel but I do like this concept. 
1M bits = 1 BTC is elegant, and you can still refer to the smallest unit (and in the future, more even smaller units?) with just 2 places after the decimal, which is a time tested easy way of doing things (as we see with many currencies like dollars, the euro, the pound).

The pictures stamped onto some Canadian coins doesn't determine the queen's influence. The Queen once had influence in Canada and does not anymore.
She is on coins.
She is NOT on all new notes, e.g.:
DNA, the discoverer of Insulin, and the Canadarm are on some notes, does this mean Canada is ruled by Astronauts?

So if you ***really liked*** bcash, then you should have paid 2900 USD per BCH (instead of the current ~200 per BCH), and then you should have sold them immediately?
This does not seem like a logical comment.

Grasp the ideas instead of forcing an almost philosophical analysis of every sentence.
And maybe don't accuse me of being rude and then reply with a one line comment reply with a link to that subreddit?

1.7 is the estimate thrown around for only a portion of transactions becoming segwit transactions (usually estimated based on current number of multisig transactions that we're seeing on the network).
The maximum is much higher if every transaction is segwit.

From your quote:


If people use more multisig then it goes higher ("about 2MB").
And if 100% of people use multisig P2WSH then the number goes even higher still.

I change a small portion of my income into coins every week, regardless of price. 
There is no better savings account.
When you always buy a little at any price and plan to continue to for the foreseeable future, you will find that you become much less concerned about the price.

That wasn't my point, and like you I don't see any problem there.
I am saying that bits is a more logical choice than sats, and that Satoshi's core client code supports that he believed this as well.

As someone who bought early, I don't want someone who makes conclusions that don't logically follow to be representative of what I think or what my opinion is.
And I guess following your logic, since I am someone who bought early, you can't disagree with or question anything I say in this thread? (Hint: you can and should, especially if my logic is broken.)
@_date: 2016-11-22 12:26:43
Yes. And if 100% of transactions became multisig txns then it would go even higher than that. 
(Redditor above was saying that the cap on segwit is 1.7MB equivalent which is clearly wrong.)

It shouldn't, yet you say:


You just said that everyone should look at his comment and think "oh, that's what ***they*** think". I am one of "they".


Well my opinion as one of the people in that group (and therefore according to you an opinion that matters in this sub) is that this sub blindly upvotes "to the moon" comments even when they are logically inconsistent.
I think that is factual, whether you think it is "rude" or not.
I don't think I was being rude, I think I was doing a service to this sub by pointing out a truth about his comment and a truth about My statement was of what I think are facts, or if not then just my informed opinion.
Is there a specific part of my comment that you think is rude? Did I curse or call names? No. I did not.
@_date: 2016-11-22 11:32:27
Just because it is underpriced doesn't mean that the price has not increased so far.
Hard to take this sub seriously when comments like that are at the top. For the people here any vaguely "bitcoin price moon!" comment trumps any interesting contribution to discussion.
@_date: 2016-11-22 13:48:31


I didn't dismiss, I started a long comment thread about his opinion.
I didn't randomly disagree, I pointed out that his argument was logically inconsistent.
This whole rudeness argument of yours is just a projection of emotion on to what I said, and really shouldn't have any bearing on the truth (or untruth) of what I'm saying. Besides, I still don't think I was being rude. 
Defending his lie (what you are doing) is to me much more rude than exposing his lie (what I am doing).


How does that in any way imply that? I was saying that this sub *prefers* to hear comments with logical inconsistencies as long as they include a mention of bitcoin price rising, over comments that have interesting things to say. So what I said there actually implies that others have interesting things to say. It's just that redditors here don't upvote those things.


No, it's just called a rhetorical question. The question's answer was obvious. Me forcing you to answer a question like that would be rude. Assuming you are intelligent enough to understand what I meant is the opposite of rude.
Again you are really just projecting an emotional response you are having on to my written text. You'd probably be interpreting me entirely differently if we had this discussion in person.

No, he is applying the concept of using at most 2 digits after the decimal place, which many currencies (including but not limited to USD) have proven works well for humans.

Those are not the same as forking the bitcoin chain.
They have no bitcoin chain data at all before their creation time. Bitcoin holders did not have their coins "cloned" onto the litecoin chain, etc.

This isn't about BTMs overcharging, it is about them misrepresenting what their fee is.
OP says some BTMs claim they have a 5% fee but actually have a 10% fee, and fudge what the global exchange market rate is to achieve this deception.
