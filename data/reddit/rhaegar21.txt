but the hardware wallet doesn't touch the internet either?

In my country, Philippines, I read that some people transact huge amounts of bitcoins like 10btc or so, and they are meeting in person to exchange btc to cash, vice versa. You can probably do this too if you're willing to take some risk.

I watched this movie back in 2015 and I can't believe the movie didn't convinced me to jump in, just some random internet guy got me to jump in 2 months ago. Sigh.

I don't think so either, but by saying "coin" I'm talking about other cryptocurrencies taking over BTC as improbable.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:34:39
Money isn't real either.

chill out

Yep, I'm not blaming the bitcoin itself but if this is the way of the merchants then I still don't think bitcoin will work as a regular currency if this continues.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:35:44
It's highly improbable for some other "coin" to take over BTC.
Edit: In my opinion.

I also experienced this while trying to buy a game using btc, they refunded pretty fast but I also lost the miner fee that I spent.

How'd they take your bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:37:41
amazon accepts bitcoin, no?

because monitors are much better for PC gaming, that kind of TV is only good for consoles.

ohh, last time I checked was last week. I'll check right now.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:04:07
fuck is wrong with you
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:43:23
I'm not an expert or anything but according to what I know, gaming monitors have higher refresh rates or response rates than a TV so there are no screen tearing or whatever while playing with it unlike in a TV.

I have like $90 worth of btc in bittrex right now but it's so expensive to transfer it out, is there no other alternative than to pay the absurd transfer fee?
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:57:07
what about the recent fork that gave BCC, who did that?
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:38:10
I wait for it to go down so I can scoop some more.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:34:49
I don't think most people think of it as a real currency, they just look at btc as an investment or source of income.
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:52:19
what app are you using?
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:25:28
I'll take it but I don't think I can win so I'll just probably not take the bet.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:59:56
How I wish someone educated me about Bitcoin back when i was a college student in 2010-2014, good luck!

It's as secured as a hardware wallet, perhaps more secure even. If you're worried someone might steal or take a picture of your paper wallet then put a passkey on it.
