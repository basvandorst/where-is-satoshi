I didn't think about blacking anything out so I don't know what they'll do. I guess as long as it has the address and account details it should be fine. It's good to not share your finance history.

My goal; collect every dollar bill not associated with crime, get the serial number &amp; make it associated with crime. Or at least make it look like it is.

Sorry let me clarify, it was a recent statement (~2 weeks old) but the account has never been used. My bank for some reason keeps making me accounts and sending me statements for them.
Student account so it doesn't cost me anything.

I sent in a photo's learners permit and a copy of a bank statement for an account I have never used. I have been able to withdraw both bitcoins and money in the past through them so I trust them relatively well. Just don't try over at Gox.

Oh shit didn't realize how big the image was. It's been a while since I last used my scanner so it's settings were a bit too high.
