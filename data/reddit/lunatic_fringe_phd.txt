Yes but nothing is stopping US from breaking THEIR legs before the game. These guys are used to laws that they can loophole. They are used to quanting angles. They think they can outthink anyone and when that doesn't work they can change positions in a split second. 
They also think they know the spots in the field that aren't level. This is going to be interesting. It's giong to be like Alien v Predator.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:39:20
Yes but it is a derivative. There is a difference.
Shorting a stock is borrowing shares then selling them to a buyer. You repay the borrowed shares later at a (hopefully) lower price. Could be one bitcoin or one hundred but there is a 1:1 ratio between the movement of the coin and your profits or losses. And you literally sell the stock (or coin).
Futures are derivatives. You can go in and out of futures ten times a second without ever touching or borrowing or selling or buying the underlying stock. Think of options. Just because I buy puts (shorting with options) there may be a correlation between them and the stock price but I haven't actually touched any stock. The stock does NOT register a "sell" order when I try to make it go down by buying a put contract. I can also sell calls if I think its going down. Or buy calls, sell puts if I think its going up. But at no time do these derivatives actually force the market to move the way buying or selling the actual stock would.
The derivatives market --- from investopedia:  The derivatives market is, in a word, gigantic, often estimated at more that $1.2 quadrillion -- is so huge that by the logic of OH NOES THERE ARE FUTURES WE ARE ALL GONNA CRASH by that logic the total world equities markets should be 10,000 % NEGATIVE. 
The easiest way to explain to scared friends is - just because you bet the Cowboys are going to lose doesn't mean they will lose. In a sense, your bet is unrelated to WHETHER they lose. Your profit, however, is 100% related to it but whether they lose or win is not influenced by whether you bet they would. Unless you're mob. 
With all of that said, though, the investing world loves to herd up and if Ashton Kutcher and Mark Cuban and Jamie Dimon all start betting that the FUTURE price of bitcoin is down, there may be other people who see that sage wisdom as bankable and actually start selling.
If they do that, buy all the way down.

@_date: 2017-12-09 07:46:07
Ah yep I oversimplified that. If you are sincerely considering future delivery of the underlying then it isn't derivative. Like the example of buying a scad of product using BTC as a currency you would want to offset that currency risk with a contract or two for future delivery.
There are options on futures but you got me, I should have been more clear.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:50:33
A big portion of it can be. Its a complex beast with something for everyone. If you had a strong feeling that a particular retailer was struggling, you may "gamble" their stock is going down but yeah, lacking insider information if you have less than 100% certainty of the likelihood of an event, kinda adds an element of chance in there.
To me the biggest issue with them is the intoxicating leverage.
I once traded commodity contracts that were worth more than everything everyone I knew would ever produce or possess. Thrilling.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:10:02
I buy items paying in BTC. I (will) buy BTC futures to make sure massive price fluctuations between the day I create the invoice and the day my products arrive will not wipe me out. 
Did I speculate? Did I short? Did I add to volatility?
No, I offset risk.
Futures can also be boring. They aren't always knives to throats.
@_date: 2018-09-23 03:10:15
Lol. I want them to have to buy from me.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:00:39
There is a current (market) price today for what a future strike price is anticipated to be. For example, what would you pay me right now today if I was to offer you the right to buy BTC on June 1st 2018 at the strike of $15,000? Answer, you would pay me at least $4000 plus whatever value I put on the time remaining. Now say the future strike is $30,000? How much would you pay me today for the right to buy a BTC for $30,000 in the future say January 1st? The market price you pay for that might be $1. Maybe $1,000. 
Make sense?
@_date: 2018-09-23 03:09:12
Thank you. Great source.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:26:32
Yes, for sure if that's what happened. They do however, expose to risk of 2x short if it rises but yeah I get your point and if "they" have enough money they can certainly push the market around.
Going to be hard though with coinbase having to verify them and then wait seven days LOL hahahahahaha
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:45:04
Ok technically that could happen but - correct me if I'm wrong - isn't buying something then shorting it just a neutral position?

LOL yeah but its the "good kind" of manipulation that allows folks to catch their breath. Conceptually it's there to keep a wild swing from getting out of hand. Like if you heard there was an earthquake affecting a pipeline and the oil market moved 10% you'd be thankful for 2 minutes to process it.
My point was just this isn't an earthquake day. This is Bitcoin.

Yeah but they have to take a side to make money. If they short something that has gone up $10,000 USD in the last month they may be a self fulfilling prophecy but they also may be the idiots in the lambos catching fire on youtube videos like when BCash tried to burn BTC a few eeks ago.

It depends on what you are hoping to accomplish. If you are looking for a quick score you need to sell when it doubles.
If you are looking to protect your $1000 in an alternate asset you might never sell.
If you want to give yourself grey hair and ulcers sell when it goes up 10%

I used the poker table example, too. It's a ledger which everyone has a copy. If a player claims he has chips then everyone can check their ledger. If the majority of the ledgers agree, that's all it takes. If someone claims to have chips but the ledgers say otherwise you trust the ledgers. Oh, and wouldn't it be sweet if you could look back at every hand ever played? Yeah, that's the block chain. And the people who keep their ledgers up to date get rewarded for proving balances the fastest so we can keep the game moving.

All I can say is this guy accepted bitcoin for his 2015 campaign and I hope he was fiscally prudent and still has some of them. If he deficit spent then he doesn't deserve the profits but think about that for a minute - he could be sitting on some 2015 bitcoins if he was prudent :) Not much of a liberal but I always like voting for smart, prudent people.

You're making a great case. Most of what you describe is what folks have used the USD for. Which is fine if you're a USD participant but still - and this is ~~not~~(edit) the big one for me - NOT decentralized. Just the fact that Uncle Sam can a) limit denominations and b) limit how much you can transmit freely... your case is made.
And every time someone mentions that all they can see for the utility of BTC (and others) is for law-breaking activities I mention "property laws are a moving target and they move the most when things are at their worst. Would your great-grandparents 'coming to the new world' story be different if they could have encrypted their belongings in the old country and spent them freely in the new country instead of showing up with one suitcase?" Of course its testimony to how stable America is (or appears to be) that most Americans can think of no reason they'd ever want decentralized money.

I like that it's decentralized. I don't think we are yet to a point where you could claim "the bitcoin standard" in the way that gold served that purpose in the past. Especially with all the dorm-room coins going ICO nowadays. But maybe down the road you would be able to make that case.

What it's supposed to be showing is general balance and specific orders @ a price. You can trust it at the moment but as another poster stated it can change fast. If the general balance leans heavy to one side or another that can be helpful to see but bear in mind that if say the green side mushrooms to 2* the red, the price will have pressure to rise and buyers may pull their orders.
But if the red side is massive it's like seeing a shark fin... you might want to stay out of the pool.

BEST EFFING ANSWER EVER.
So yes, it could be done. But you'd need to communicate with an old wallet or a miner who gets a reward. 
Or I guess get lucky if you buy 100,000,000sat and they happen to come all from the same coin.
Now I'm on a quest.
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:59:24
Right right I get that they have the same value but I guess think of it like the Grandma's Birthday Card example: Granny goes to the bank and asks for a shiny $50 bill (or $2 bill or whatever) she doesn't say "whatever you got that adds up to $50" 
I know they are worth the same. What I'm trying to do is find out - is there an analog to that $50 bill. If I get change I get two twenties and a ten but that $50 still exists somewhere, right?
If I wanted to put one BTC into a paper wallet and put it in my safety deposit box it would be snazzy if it was one BTC *mentally* for me. Like a stock certificate for 100 shares or a gold coin instead of some gold nuggets.

Soldiers with enormous weapons protect oil.
I can't really think of anything worth a hundred billion USD that doesn't use up a s ton of resources to protect except maybe the poppy fields of Afghanistan and that's only because we already spent 6 trillion dollars on them and they're so dang far out in the middle of nowhere.

I'm not an expert on this so no slamma my jamma. When you buy bitcoin for the first time you pay with fiat through coinbase. The seller gets that same amount of fiat. However, tether was created as a way to hold value but not in coins and to be slack when buyers and sellers didn't match up exactly. So you create some tether. And no one tells you not to. So you make some more. And it's sitting there, all shiny and new and hey, some guy sells his bitcoin but not to a buyer, just to you, the tether printer so you're running low so you literally whip up a new batch of magic internet money. Again and again and again. Sellers get tether. Tether buys coins. Make more tether. No problem if it's $1,000. Big problem if it's $1,000,000,000 magic money and no new fiat coming in.

You're not being stupid starting with crypto. You're a fucking genius starting with crypto and I mean that from the POV of someone who has made a lot of money in stocks and cryptos.
Tip: read as much about investing as you can stand. Most successful investors buy buy buy buy. Sell only when necessary.
HOLD winners, cut losers.
Trading is how you get your teeth kicked in. In and out is so freaking hard to pull off. NOW of course if you see something ridiculous you act on it. Like when bitcoin went from $5,000 to $20,000 in two months that was ridiculous. You sell. But don't try to jump in and out of the market. It's extremely difficult to make a profit at it. Yes, it's exciting but so is selling drugs next to a police station.

"Proof of future coins" is what I'm so curious about. I mean I know I have shares and, therefore, future coins, but how would that become anything other than a trust situation? Like I could send you my ethermine address but what proves I'm the owner and following that what assures you that I'll send any of it to you? 
So interesting!
@_date: 2018-03-13 08:05:23
Everything the other posters have answered is true. However without knowing this "mined coins" person I can say I'm a miner and maybe -just maybe- the person is giving you partially inaccurate info. As in, if they have been mining in a pool that pays per share and have not paid out yet they may have a stack of shares that are worth coins - eventually- but aren't coins yet, literally.
This is extremely unlikely unless the miner had intended to have an unmined transaction way way way in advance or is a massive miner.
I personally am curious about this but in no way would I hand over goods on these terms without a gun to my head.

It certainly does sound like a flim flam. I obviously don't know these people personally but if they are legit and sincere then they are using wording that sounds sketchy AF and my admittedly casual observation feels like they have even contradicted themselves in that the coins are either not issued or they are stored somewhere. They can't be both. And the likelihood that they are unissued is extremely slim. On top of all of that other than something nefarious I can't figure out why they would want to trade in such a sketchy sounding instrument as unissued coins. Is it to avoid taxation or maybe money laundering? Hate to be so suspicious but this is the kind of thing I'd avoid. Like if someone was offering you gold that had been mined but not melted into an ingot you could make a reasonable scientific assumption of its value and take a businessperson's risk. But this is different. I'd walk away but that's me.

It's never going up again. You are cursed and everything you buy will sink slowly and painfully and in public view since this is a public ledger that we can tell you bought at the top and will sell at the first sign of difficulty. Get out now.

To further make your point you should give me the percentage of cryptos that are spent like currencies vs the percentage that is bought with fiat, appreciates, and then sold for fiat . I will assert that buying crypto with fiat then selling it for fiat or tether (which is USD tether in other words tethered to the dollar) means you did not use it like a currency. Buying Yen then going to Japan and spending Yen is a currency. Buying Euro then ordering an Airbus is currency. Buying crypto with fiat then selling for fiat is apples to apples with stocks. If you can change my mind I'm ready to hear it.

You are totally 100% describing every market manipulation throughout history prior to (and sometimes even after) government regulation. Stocks used to be "every man for himself" a century ago. Because some people, left to their own devices, will eventually start trying to rock the boat.
Did you ever read the Herbert Henry Dow story? American entrepreneur who used the market manipulation shit against the powers that be.
From Wikipedia:   
With his new company and new technology, Dow produced bromine very cheaply, and began selling it in the United States for 36 cents per pound. At the time, the German government supported a bromine cartel, Bromkonvention, which had a near-monopoly on the supply of bromine, which they sold in the US for 49 cents per pound. The Germans had made it clear that they would dump the market with cheap bromine if Dow attempted to sell his product abroad. In 1904 Dow defied the cartel by beginning to export his bromine at its cheaper price to England. A few months later, an angry Bromkonvention representative visited Dow in his office and reminded him to cease exporting his bromine.[6]
Unafraid, Dow continued exporting to England and Japan. The German cartel retaliated by dumping the US market with bromine at 15 cents a pound in an effort to put him out of business. Unable to compete with this predatory pricing in the U.S., Dow instructed his agents to buy up hundreds of thousands of pounds of the German bromine locally at the low price. The Dow company repackaged the bromine and exported it to Europe, selling it even to German companies at 27 cents a pound. The cartel, having expected Dow to go out of business, was unable to comprehend what was driving the enormous demand for bromine in the U.S., and where all the cheap imported bromine dumping their market was coming from. They suspected their own members of violating their price-fixing agreement and selling in Germany below the cartel's fixed cost. The cartel continued to slash prices on their bromine in the U.S., first to 12 cents a pound, and then to 10.5 cents per pound. The cartel finally caught on to Dow's tactic and realized that they could not keep selling below cost, they then increased their prices worldwide.[6]

I like the argument that you're making but velocity is exactly how you can have less than $6 trillion but still move $6 trillion. Granted, it would be extremely ludicrous to have $6 trillion of velocity with $80 billion, that would mean 75 transactions a day for the whole pile of coins but if you look at the derivatives markets you see the daily volume exceeds the global net worth because once Wall St figures out how to make a couple satoshi on every transaction there will be trillions of transactions.

When did QT start and how much have they tightened already?
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:53:21
Maybe when the transactions speed up a bit?
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:05:17
S9 like $1200 I think on bitmain site if that means anything.

Wise but doesn't have to be that fast, even. Buy. Wait. Buy more. Waaaaaaaait. Buy more.
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:37:33
Wait are you saying $10 billion of tightening will skyrocket rates? 
You know we are $20 trillion in debt, right?

Have you tried Betterhash? One gpu and ok CPU that's a decent solution.

Not everyone knows every paranoid conspiracy delusion. You are (((ass)))uming a lot.
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:04:23
Well then that's definitely one way to do it. Commendable.
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:40:39
I am in favor of tightening, come what may.
I am in favor of auditing the Fed.
Bring on the economic collapse.

Cool I can accumulate more.

Magic internet money.

I don't really want to keep this going but my tiny brain can't reconcile "it doesn't take a lot to pop the whole thing" and "yields aren't going up" and all the tightening that is already happening.
Because if tightening pops the bubble, why hasn't it?
I'm not disputing your facts.
I'm saying - straight up - if your contention is that a little tightening will pop the bubble and we are already tightening... when do we get the pop?

It makes sense if you remember that around the world rates are low or even negative. We have a long way to go before what you're describing takes effect. 
I'm guessing you're maybe old enough to recall a time when there wasn't this much slack in the chain.
Think about it. US rates start to rise. Buyers step in. Rinse repeat. This will take a while until buyers dry up. Then rates rise.
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:48:34
I understand what you're saying I'm just contending - even including leverage - ten billion isn't going to scatter the herd.

Yes. Just to make sure I have your address right can you send .05 BTC to 1800MixALot and I'll send you back 1 BTC

Ever since Kardashian bagged on snapchat I stopped getting my financial advice from it. Ironic that a dead medium is bored of BTC.

Epic retort. You won reddit today, my friend.
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:07:45
Probably get a lot of hate for saying this but that's not a huge drop considering how many reds in a row. Never got out of hand, never gapped, it was $80 move on a $2500 price... seems like the market absorbed it well. 40 minutes of sustained net selling. Looks healthy.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:21:27
By that logic I'd guess this seller is net long a large position so they wanted to liquidate some but not slit their own throat. McAfee is that smart.

And not to put salt in your wounds but stop losing your BTC!
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:32:51
Depends on who you are asking the price. Look at Coinbase Pro then look at Binance. Not the same.
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:12:49
Just my opinion but your statement makes the assumption that a) bitcoin wants to replace fiat and b) peer to peer failed.
 I can't agree with either of those.

If you want to keep it, keep it. If you don't want to keep it, trade it.

Do not try to talk yourself into believing it is not a scam.
IT IS A SCAM.
You will desperately want it to be even 1% possible.
It is not possible. 
@_date: 2019-05-29 01:40:34
Nope. 
But to be fair, I wouldn't accept a $100 bill without verifying it, either. It isn't about the currency. It's about the person giving it to you.

@_date: 2018-12-15 05:12:56
In with you. OP says the weak hands waited a year and as soon as it rallies they'll start dumping BELOW where they could sell right now?
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:11:52
Easier said than done. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:24:11
Is it passive? Sounds pretty cool.
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:23:46
Are you sure? Because if there aren't any underlying bitcoin, then someone is naked.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:26:18
I think those addresses OP used were just made up examples.

Why does everyone who talks about crypto have such a fixation with the 90 days from Nov 1 2017 to Jan 30 2018.
Yeah, you're right, but I could also say cars last for years and what if you bought your car at literally any other time than ATH?
Anyone who lost 84% should be studied by social-scientists to figure out what the hell they were thinking. OH, I'LL STAY OUT UNTIL I SEE 100X RETURNS AND THEN I'LL BUY AND NOW THAT I'VE BOUGHT I'LL STAY IN UNTIL I SEE 84% DECLINES LOLZ

With all due respect, those companies that have all been hacked or compromised or back doored can build whatever they want. If anyone thinks that facebookchain won't be hacked to death they're being silly.

Thanks for the explanation. So then the ones who get rekt are whoever is on the wrong side of the trade.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:43:44
OP has been online since this comment was posted. Not seeing any proof. Hmmmm. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:35:46
Think that's bad? Try paying cash for a car then run home immediately and get it appraised. You might be surprised.

BTC would be worth a million dollars each.
Now ask me the price of gold. (Hint, its a million dollars a gram).
