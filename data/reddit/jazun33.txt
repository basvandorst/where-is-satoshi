It's like you're not getting the message

Government is "the powerful [doing] whatever they want to the weak" disguised as the weak "deciding on stuff we do together." Because it already is "corrupted by money and power." Nice try, tho...

The most hilarious thing is that no one was saying this back when BTC was at $30. Back then $30 was stratospheric.

Nice, that's my home universe. Maybe I'll see you sometime in the Oort Cloud... On second thought I don't visit there very often.

I felt the same at first but after pondering it further I thought just how apt the metaphor was. Copernicus and the heliocentric theory certainly wasn't the be all end all in our understanding of the cosmos but it was a revolutionary step in breaking free from the tyranny of religious coercive rule and eventually paving the way to the Enlightenment. So for now, Bitcoin is at the center of the financial universe. But later well discover that the universe is actually much larger with billions of galaxies and trillions of stars. And that's alright. It's just the way the market works. I for one am glad the market is finally beginning to take its first major post-industrial-revolution steps at operating without the need for central banks.

The only guy who looks like an arse here is you. I was just curious if something like this existed. I don't mind taking cash. Bitcoin is just preferable.
@_date: 2013-06-02 06:24:56
He also doesn't seem like he's too motivated or interested in understanding bitcoin. I feel like this is the case with a lot of old school supply-siders. I understand the sentiment and I can't really blame them for being suspicious, but money is only that which we agree it is, and if people prefer bitcoin over gold when making online purchases then so be it. Gold is great but it is only decentralized if you're transacting on the local level. Anytime you want to transport gold (or the value of gold) it requires 3rd parties, which would naturally incur counter-party risk. So in a modern, global economy, I can still see gold as a tool for the long-term storage of value, but as a globally recognized digital currency? All signs point to BTC for that one, and these older dudes should really do themselves a favor and study it out just a little bit more.

Wallet solutions like electrum remove barriers to entry. That's how I got started. Dedicating 6 gigs of your C:\ drive to store the entire blockchain  is a commitment.

Comparing this to the tulip bubble is wrong for one reason not mentioned in this article - you can always grow more tulips. So I'm not sure it'll hit a huge crash like the tulip bubble where it permanently stays low after everyone realizes just how easy they are to grow. What happened to tulips was a crash and then a correction to the real market value of a plant you can produce in your garden.
Bitcoin may still have bumpy road ahead (especially when the weaker Euro-zone countries start clamoring for bailouts and are going through austerity) But I don't think they'll hit an ultimate low and sit there like a plant would.

It irks me to no end when people say BTC might be dubious because its used for illegal transactions. Were illegal transactions conducted before 2009? If so, what currencies were used? Could it be that those traditional currencies are still used for illegal activity? When will mainstream journalists grow a functioning neo-cortex over their naked brain stems?

And all this is being done without government mandate or tax payer money! Who says infrastructure MUST be provided by the state?
