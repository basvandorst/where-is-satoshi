The only thing though is that his company is Andressen Horowitz, and in all honesty Marc Andressen is a shit-head. If you want I can provide a couple of links, but I'm about to go to bed for the night, so I'll check back tomorrow.

Even savvy techies will consult others more knowledgeable in a subject. Actually, that's how people learn!

To be honest I wasn't really talking in the confines of the political compass, had I wanted to I could have used it for the dimensions but I was at school and being lazy.

Yeah I doubt, I mean they could just go and instead of sending the DoS attack through Tor they would just ping the tor address to get the ip and send the DoS straight to the ip instead of through the ToR address.

True true, but you should be able to trace through to a server, because they have a normal address you can correspond between the two.

Yes this man is not a far right wing, if he was far right he would be a neo-con authoritarian in support of the fed and highly oppose even the premise of bitcoin.
In addition the far right is not concerned with constitutionality they are concerned with forcing their morals on to others and lining the pockets of there buddies in the defense and agricultural industries.
He sounds more like he is from the libertarian wing of the republicans, basically a wing that really should just drop the republicans all together imo.

Oh I agree it makes sense, it is just strange seeing such a short message being signed, I'm used to only seeing lengthy posts signed and all of that fun.
@_date: 2013-07-10 14:54:44
Hmm, not a very important message, and I highly doubt it was worth signing it but hey, thumbs up!

I use it legitimately all the time to get around annoying web filters. When I need social media networks to do my job and the coffee shop I'm working in blocks them, there is no way I'm about to be complacent and let them block me from getting on there.

My sister works at this club, I'm so shocked that I saw this club here.

The only thing that bugged me is when they said bitcoin is like a stock in the the price fluctuates. No, it is like a currency in that the real value fluctuates, and as such the value in terms of different currencies changes.

But just to quote them a well, they likely feel the lose in business due to ASIC's is truly negligible.

Only dug up the post history because I wasn't sure which camp you were in, you sounded anarchist but I wasn't sure if it was communist anarchy, or capitalist, or even one of the other types.
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:28:09
I find it incredibly hard to believe that you moved that much product, not saying you didn't but any proof of that haha, mostly because I'm curious.

Avast just did the same for me, I've never usaully had an issue with Avast being over strict.
But then again Avast has been going down hill lately.

Seeing as you are probably a libertarian based on your posting history, do you realize how the actions they are committing to by selling closed source software is something that would certainly exist in a anarchocapatilist or free market society. They are free to do so, and by doing so they actually aren't relying on any sorts of IP laws regarding their code. Their entire intention of keeping it closed source is to protect their IP, which is something that people would continue to do in a libertarian world.
Oh, and btw you ms paint skills need some [work.](
Oh, and almost forgot to say I'm a libertarian myself.
@_date: 2013-08-05 01:22:45
Yeah, I could but I just use TOR anyways.
