Sorry for my terrible presentation. I did say I was bored, so I dont really care but anways to help out:
 The point of this image was to show you how much bitcoin really is worth, and to try to get you to comprehend that, I do so by showing its worth in £ (or $ if you're willing to work it out!). Each note is 1 value of £50 and having "5" labelled on it shows there are... 5 of them! The bitcoin has a 1 next to it so its... 1 Bitcoin! The arrows are just telling you what things are, they aren't data. I tried to make it simpler but i guess that didn't work in your scenario.

I know this is a bit complex, it takes some understanding. I'll explain.
