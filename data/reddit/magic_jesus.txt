I believe that's the original Terminator you're thinking of.  And while we're on the subject, why do the 6502 instructions appear in his visual field?  Does he then have to use multiple layers of neurons to decode what those instructions say before he can then execute e.g. an 8-bit add?

Another thing in favour of prcdice (and the dead/sleeping JustDice) is that the owners are actually known.  Primedice is a very likely candidate for a site that will just disappear with the deposits and investor cash.

OK, so I'm a moron, but where does this 10 minute block thing come from?
And since people occasionally moan about txs taking too long to confirm, will that 10 minute thing ever improve?  Like, if all the computers on the network got twice as fast, and their internet connection speeds doubled, would we go down to 5 minute blocks?

Do you think bitcoin is a good name?  It's undeniably pretty catchy.  
But the "coins" bit is really misleading, and makes everyone think (a) they're indivisible units and (b) they are some kind of binary file stored on your pc in a wallet.
And everything to do with computers is based on "bits", so that part of the name is completely pointless.

It wouldn't be too tricky to get your computer to churn through all the possibilities if you'd just lost a couple of words.
I'm inspired by this thread to actually spend 10 minutes properly learning my 12 words.  It seems like it's manageable - I wonder if it's the sort of thing we all might have done easily e.g. as an exercise for school, but are no longer willing to spend the time on?
Ask me tomorrow if I still remember all 12 words :)

“Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich. [...]
"But we have also," continued the management consultant, "run into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current going rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship's peanut." [...]
"So in order to obviate this problem," he continued, "and effectively revalue the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and...er, burn down all the forests. I think you'll all agree that's a sensible move under the circumstances.”

There's nothing tricky going on.  A private key is just any number between 1 and (nearly) 2^256.  You don't really "compute" them, like you suggest.  The fact that people tend to write these numbers in hex rather than decimal is irrelevant.
I like to imagine a vast bank vault with unlocked safe deposit boxes, numbered from 1 to (nearly) 2^256.  You just choose any box that you fancy and put your money in there.  Other people do the same.  You just have to remember "my money is in box 5389582423464549385929385".  Oh, but don't put your cash in the box nearest the door, because people will probably look in there (this is a reference to bad brain wallets!).

Hmm, so what I was getting at in my initial post was this:  
Suppose that today we are happy with the system doing 10 minutes of work per block.  Then tomorrow everything (processors/network stuff) all works twice as fast, and we could do that same amount of work (which we were happy with before) in 5 minutes.  Why do we not do that?

An attacker doesn't need to target you specifically.  It's easy to grab a list of all addresses containing coins, from the blockchain.  
Then try out all the various passwords/passphrases you can think of, and see if you match anything on that list.

It might help if you understand the "discriminant" of the curve, which is defined as D = -16 (4a^3 + 27b^2)
If D is positive you get a function with a separate loop and a curve.  If D is negative there's a single component.
So when D = 0 you get the singular case where the curve has some weird cusp or self-intersection, and doesn't behave very nicely.

Agreed...it's nice that these places are starting to accept it, but nothing that's been listed above is especially compelling.

Yes, working from a bootable TAILS USB is very sensible, and not difficult even if you're clueless about linux.
I don't know about using the bitaddress javascript to generate keys - there has been mention of browsers doing inadequate random number generation in the past.
My preference was to just put a copy of electrum on my TAILS persistent volume.  The first time I ran it, it generated a 12 word passphrase for me, (which is the only thing I need to remember to access my coins, no extra USB sticks are involved).  Electrum is very pleasant to use, and will create as many addresses as you want.

Imagine a vast vault full of (unlocked) safe-deposit boxes.  Vast, as in one box for every grain of sand on earth.
Choose one at random and keep your money it...that's a perfectly safe thing to do.  Other people could devote their lives to checking one box after another for money, but they'll (probably) not find anything even after millions of years of searching.
That all works fine until someone chooses a distinctive box, e.g. one of the boxes right next to the vault entrance.  These are analogous to single-character brainwallets.

Did you really just plot a chart showing gold price against BTC, and then try to convince everyone that gold is "vanishing" because BTC's price has been shooting up over the last month?
@_date: 2015-03-04 07:53:49
Ok...First thing to know is that you can take any value - text, or a number, or whatever - and mangle it using some procedure ("hashing"), to turn it into a single "hash" value.
This is deterministic, so if you repeat the procedure you'll always get the same hash value for the same input.
However, if you have some hash value, it's incredibly hard (effectively impossible for the standard kinds of hash we use today) to find an input that hashes into that particular hash value.
So....simplest way a betting site could work is that they roll the dice, and generate some text that records the result - e.g. "at 7.52 am, we rolled a 5 for user dogglegangme".
Now they create the hash value for that text (let's say it comes out at 398284982984).
They show you this hash value on the website and you can make your bet.   After you've bet, they tell you if you've won or lost.
If you want to prove they didn't cheat you, you can get them to show you that text -  "at 7.52 am, we rolled a 5 for user dogglegangme".  And you can check that the hash value of this is indeed 398284982984.
This is a very stripped down example - the dice sites tend to combine various seeds and actually use the hashing procedure to generate the random numbers.  But this shows the principle :)
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:09:29
All good points, but "wallet" does, very unhelpfully, make people think that there are actual _coins_ in some digital form stuffed inside the wallet.  Of course, the name "Bitcoin" also perpetuates that illusion :D
Personally I like to think of this "entity that you have to store on your computer/paper/in your head" as a "safe deposit box number".
@_date: 2015-11-14 11:37:28
Ahh, but isn't defying expectations at the very heart of comedy?
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:25:48
Guess it's all subjective.  "Safe deposit box number" works fine for me - makes me think of some vast secure vault with a particular box that only I can access.
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:36:14
But the concept of a "wallet" hardly conjures up an image of something that's impervious to theft or legally authorised raids.
@_date: 2015-02-23 07:08:45
It sounds like he hasn't considered that someone could run a non-record-keeping tumbling service that takes your coins, and gives you other coins later (perhaps split into multiple transactions, and randomising the fee a little bit).
So you can have anonymity, but AFAIK it does involve trusting a (possibly shady) third party.
