It's not about letting people know the price is moving. It's about letting people know that you know that the price is moving. It also easier then doing any of the things that strengthen ₿. Like minning or God forbid spending a single satoshi. Just keep typing HODL on the same 5 memes that'll show people that your a real deal bitcoiner

BCH fork changed the block size limit to 8 MB. ₿ block size limit is 1MB. What this means is more transaction can be mined in a larger block, so more transactions can potentially be mined simultaneously. 
The real problem with BCH is that they have never truly utilized their increased block size limit. They rarely even mine blocks at 4 MB. Ultimately it was an unneccessary fork that should have died a while ago.
@_date: 2019-10-11 07:00:53

BCH wasnt "neccessary" for ASIC boost BTC miners just refused to allow its application initially. It's the only reason BCH even had any marketability in the first place. Now that you can use ASIC miners on BTC its irrelevant. Probably why BCH keeps withering in value by comparison.

With BTC daily active users is whats need most for the price to go back up. There is plenty of attention on BTC right now but in terms of actual daily users I dont think much has changed in the past 6 months. 
The price had to come back down from 19k.  As you have the mass sell orders from mt gox coinciding with bad new about fraud and potential regulation of crypto, the price started to drop. Now so many people are just chanting  HODL not realizing it's contributing to the falling price. As a huge portion of the owned BTC is not moving around. It's going to be A long summer.

They are offering like retirement accounts backed by  btc. Think of an IRA. You give money to bakkt they hold it in an account which earns interest and they in turn buy btc and hold onto it for you.  With accounts like this bakkt has to own btc equal to the account value for the term of the account. The upside to an account backed by a commodity is if the value of the commodity goes up so does the value of the account. Unlike a traditional IRA which gains a specified amount of interest over time. When you go to withdraw bakkt would liquidate the btc and give you what ever fiat currency you invested with.

Look at north Korea. For the first time in years They are in discussion with South korea. They celebrated the Olympics togeather and are in discussions to open up trade between the two states, why?. Because of BTC. The wealth of north Koreans is being hidden in crypto. Couple this with global sanctions and the fact that noone will trade with north Korea and you have a very unstable communist dictatorship.  
Crypto currencies give people financial power and freedom. As they grow, dictatorships will fall.  If you can't control the money of your people you can't  control your people. With all the propaganda claiming the negatives of BTC dont forget the immense good that will come. China you're next.

This guy is on the money. If you look at the later 19 through the early 20th century, when our money was backed by gold then silver then gold again then eventually nothing. As tons of gold and silver was mined and entered the market there were multiples bubbles and market crashes as prices soared. Then eventually the supply stabilized and so did the price. I feel like this is what btc is going through.  It's gonna rise and crash several times. Then some alt coin might over take it. Who knows, it's all speculative. What's not is that block chain, to date, is the most secure way we have to transfer value digitally. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:14:05
That's not true. The people who have the capacity to sell off 1000s of btc at a time are original adopters. When they sell off they use that money to reinvest into the infrastructure of btc making it more accessible to larger markets which is why you always see a delayed surge in price in the months to follow the sell offs.

I really hope people will eventually understand that BTC being successful will NEVER and I mean NEVER = the end of banks. BTC will eventually take over and be adopted into the financial infrastructure we have. Abandoning the banking industry just means it all on you.  If you have to capital and resources to make it work good on you.  If you ever need a loan though you're kinda screwed. I love btc. I want btc to become the standard for money but banks aren't going out of business or going away.
@_date: 2019-05-07 18:21:08
Kinda, it complicated. Blockchain+ a public ledger+the hashrate required to mine transactions are what give btc its security. Its virtually impossible to push a fraudulent transaction through the network. However transactions are irreversible. So unlike your credit card company, who monitors your spending and shut your card down when fraud is suspected and covers fraudulent expenditures. With btc all the responsibility for security lies on you.  If someone get your private keys and empties your wallet, then no one can do anything for you. Btc is a fantastic  solution to the ways that financial institutions play with and lose people's money. However if you want to buy something you cant afford, like a house,  you need a bank.

So a few things on that example. It involved the issuance of common stock in Dole and not an ETF that contained some of Doles assets. This example also took place during a merger when the DTC that put a chill on the sales of common stock but didnt account for the final 3 days of issued stock prior to the merger.  
Not sure how this example relates to a crypto ETF.

You know what actually makes the price go up, no not memes. You, actually using your btc. Talking the people you know into using btc. Do that

I showed each of them how to set up the trezor using a laptop. Then created the recovery seed and stored it in a safe place. Then to show them how a btc transaction worked I used coinbase and scanned the qr code off the trezor that represents the address and sent them the btc.

I never said bull run. I'm pointing out the most likely reason for the most recent downturn and the mostly likely point to change that trend. If a major investment market starts buying and selling a commodity it will raise its price.

What are you even talking about. Apple stock was first sold in the 80s the iphone came out in 2007. By 2007 apple was dominant in the tech space. When ppl say why didnt you buy apple when it was cheap they are talking about the early 90s when Microsoft was a titan and owning an apple was looked down on

That is a very reductive and inaccurate way of describing rehypothecation. A better way would be saying that multiple financial institutions offered an investment in which they claimed ownership of the same asset and used that asset as collateral to the investment. 
I suppose this could be seen as an issue but if ICE is offering the ETF and commingles BTC assets with their trillions of dollars of other assets, which they will, then what's the worry. They'll have the capital to cover the sales. Really the only potential negative I see is them over selling shares on these ETFs the price skyrocketing and a bunch of people selling off in mass which could create a situation where ICe has to liquidate other assets to cover the sell off. But Isnt that what everyone wants? To get rich at the expense of wallstreet.

I have set up 3 trezor wallets. I like their ease of use and functionality. Highly recommend them.

Everything I've read says late January is the target date

This article article is silly and most likely written by someone who only just barely understands how cryptocurrency works.  I have no concern with the trezor wallets I've set up.

I'm just hoping it pushes down below 3200 so I can get another before its starts climbing again.

I'm aware. But this guy is advocating a mass exodus. Everyone isnt going to use coinbasepro and even if they did coinbase would just impose additional fees. The point still remains this would not hurt them but it would make them money

Hilarious. Don't get me wrong I love BtC and block chain but sometimes you guys talk like were living in a story book.

They are the reason the price started crashing again. Literally the day they announced they were pushing back to Jan people started mass selling. If they go active the price will rise
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:53:27
Never said there would be a bull run. But when bakkt goes active there will be a major increase in trading volume which will push the price up.

I dont know why you got downvoted, made me laugh

I cant remember the last time BTC had back to back weeks of growth without a major crash on the weekend. The fact that this growth is consistent and stable is some of the best news in BTC in the last year. I'm so stoked!!!
