You don't buy.  You don't "hodl".  You don't sell.  What you are supposed to do is occasionally rebalance your investment portfolio to bring it back to your target allocation.
E.g. if your target portfolio allocation includes a 10% crypto allocation, the recent crash may have caused your portfolio's allocation to change, such that you are now only 5% allocated into crypto.  Rebalancing your portfolio doesn't mean spending all of your cash to buy as much crypto as you can - it means selling *some* of your other non-crypto investments in order to buy enough crypto to bring your portfolio back into your target allocation: 10% invested into crypto.  Provided that your target portfolio is diverse, you will never "run out of money" because no matter how far crypto crashes, you can always sell some more of your non-crypto assets to bring your allocation back into balance.  The only way you could ever "run out of money" is if you changed your target allocation to become 100% crypto which would be unwise considering how unstable crypto currencies currently are.
Take note that this works both ways!  When the price of crypto surges, your portfolio becomes unbalanced in the opposite direction.  E.g. if your target crypto allocation is 10%, a price surge might cause your crypto allocation to become 15% - when this happens, you should sell *some* of your crypto holdings to bring your portfolio back into balance again.
And remember: so long as you have a well diversified portfolio, time in the market beats timing the market.
