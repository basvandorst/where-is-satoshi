[Celebrating 200$ in Bitcoinity](
Next celebration at 1000$!

Well, you pointed out a good argument there.
The problem for now and, I guess, the short, mid and probably long term of the coin is the stability.
Stability is crucial in order to use a coin in everyday transactions. And that is the objective of Bitcoins, be used! In the end, if people don't use bitcoins for buying stuff, the instrinsic value of the coin would be 0 and it will fall.
Who is spending bitcoins buying stuff now? Nobody, that would mean lose money. There are many people speculating with it right now.
However, the idea of bitcoin is really good and has the potential to success. The thing here is, if bitcoin is succesful, it is worth much more than 200$. But that will take years to know. Think about it, it is completely normal that introducing a new currency in the market causes a huge impact. In this scenario the question is, when and where will it stabilize in order to be able to create truly business oportunities around it.

[It's a TRAP!](

I don't see why couldn't it be used as you say. In that case it will be similar to gold. 
However I suspect that then it will be too susceptible to a sudden fall of the price. But this is just a personal opinion, I could be wrong.

You may be right but people don't want to think this is a bubble (neither me) but there is some evidence in that direction.
Also, I truly beleive the whole idea  is great so I don't see the bitcoin just dissapearing and falling to 0. May be an adjustment of the value in the next hours/days/weeks. Or not. Who knows.

Actually banks are not there to keep your money safe. Seems that most people here think that.
Although they were created for that reason, today the main purpose of banks is to articulate the money between the people who have savings and the people who need money, this is, the financial system.
The financial system is key in our societies.
If the bitcoin is succesful, it will need a financial system. This means, some sort of banks.

Bitstamps seems pretty good too for EUR traders

Funny thing is, nobody really can know what is going to happen.
I thought to buy in 120$, but I waited, then at 140$, then when at 120$ again and finally I bought at 148$.
If you look the graph you see clearly when you should have bought but in the moment you have to do it, its a lottery.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:08:18
That's fairly accurate
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:44:17
Seems that now is falling a bit. I just can't stop whatching at bitcoinity, this shit is better than a football match

If you beleive in bitcoin I think the best option here is buy some and come back to see the value in a month. Consider it as a high risk investment for now, be prepared to lose it and don't panic with the high volatiliy. Otherwise the next days are gonna be tense.

I did it on Monday and I was the 9800 or so. It is going very slow bc at the moment I am the 8100.
I'm sure the queue now is over 15k

People mainaining their own wallets by themselves would be, as you well say, a complete disaster because that would block the economy.
But I wouldn't worry for that because bitcoin 'banks' will appear and people will use them, not to keep their money safe but to get some interest for their money. As long as this interest is better than the one that they'd get for maintaining the bitcoins for themselves.

it is required some factors that bitcoin doesn't have yet in order to create the first 'bitcoin bank' but, there is a really interesting opportunity right there. Who knows? if bitcoin take off that could be the 'JPMorgan' of tomorrow.
Among other factors, it needs the bitcoin stable and a solid and clear legal base.
