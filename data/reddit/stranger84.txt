hey guys, im new and i want to ask where can I find free BTC? Small symbolic amount? :( 
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:46:16
I bought bitcoins in December 2017. At the moment I'm basically homeless, I do not have a job, and depression deprives me of my will to live. I do not know if I can survive next year. The worst thing is that I'm slowly starting to lose hope ... I do not see the future, I'm afraid I will not get out of this shithole anymore. To make matters worse, I am in a country in Central Europe with no prospects for a better tomorrow. Today for lunch I had rice with carrots, and what do you know about a difficult situation?

Hope.. thats all what I need.
