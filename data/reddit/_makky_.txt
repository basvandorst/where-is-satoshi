Ok 7+ confirmation should have been indicated by now in Jaxx. Please re-confirm the wallet address, check the internet connection on the device or Jaxx BTC wallet screen click the small refresh button above "BTC". Lemme know.

No wonder the exchanges are supporting him.

Segwit wallets for android except GreenBit?
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:26:06
1 USD = 1 USD?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:29:39
That's ok mate! Good day!
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:34:39


It is indeed high time. 13 dollars for 2k withdrawal is ok. It's only 0.65%. You could use Eth or BCH if transaction fee is your concern.

Haha I am almost on my way to spiritual enlightenment after overcoming my frustration in 9 days :P
Could you please direct me to the accelerator you used?
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:37:29
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:18:32
That's ok :) I'll try and answer. What type of wallet are you transferring it to ?
@_date: 2019-11-17 07:09:24
Ask why... Asshole.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:30:16
if you can't beat 'em, join 'em... I guess :D

Yea. He made a fortune by relentlessly developing videoshop.  
He is the [founder ]( [videoshop](

This is the exact problem. Most bitcoin users would transact on a smartphone and not many smart phone wallets can make a segwit transaction :(

Interesting could you dm me some sources I could refer to know more.
@_date: 2017-04-02 04:06:01
Why don't we move the logo 10 pixels left, Rainbow guys are cool they might help as well
@_date: 2017-04-02 04:42:57
We give you a way through B you let us shift our Segwit logo 10 pixels left. How about that?
Edit: or leave the logo alone B of the word Bitcoin alone and you could pass through the background.

If anyone ever had the resources to do that, BTC core would just choose to fork itself at block just before the attack. Because a 51% attack will be pretty apparent right now it that ever happens.
@_date: 2017-04-02 04:16:00
I don't think we can win or make truce with Iceland and France.
The effort to shift will be worth it!

Not buying until it accepts bitcoin xD
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:24:43
Yea few bunch of these fences shall do it.
Do not underestimate these fuckers.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:43:00
JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon has said he would fire anyone trading bitcoin because it is "stupid".
Few days after the statement:
*His client trades bitcoin*
 CEO of JP Morgan just call his company client a stupid?**
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:45:25
Queries and post like these are the reason why I have started feeling that we are in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:54:49
Come on. Show up say you lied if you lied. Why the suspense. Grrr..
@_date: 2018-07-27 04:28:59
Trying to save her long position I guess.
@_date: 2018-07-27 04:31:23
Did you hold any fund in this account? Have they been frozen now?
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:20:23
Marking this comment, interested to know.
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:12:03
Fear, uncertainty and doubt
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:29:38
There fixed it now :)
