This is the one I currently use:
I'm going to give yours a try now

Would this be less secure though if using a public computer?  I guess not if 2FA is still enabled?
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:01:05
That wouldn't get the attacker past the 2FA and people who have this enabled are reporting their coins missing.

Good point, I wonder how much is in the hot wallet at any given time.  Granted if it was the hot wallet itself compromised it wouldn't come from individual accounts.  Who knows what is going on.

Possible, but would Dooglus at Just-dice really do this? Especially when he accepts that as a deposit method.

Follow the instructions under offline armory:

Backup for this claim?

12 BTC likely gone for me.......ouch :(

Can you elaborate more on client side cryptography?  Currently I have vast majority of coins in cold storage, but I do keep some spending cash in an online wallet.  Might as well choose the option with the best security.

TradeFortress just replied:
"The attacker was able to empty the balance on accounts with the API key enabled. The issue is being actively looked upon.
Everyone who has lost money will be fully reimbursed. "

BTCQuick.com takes creditcard I thought

Lots of people:
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:45:29
Are these the first thefts ever reported with 2FA enabled?

Ask tradefortress, he should have a ton lying around

What happened to the post in this thread that had all of TF's personal information?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:39:39
beat me to it, but this is it

On a more serious note I find wiring USD to bitfinex to be the best.  Credited to your account right away and can use their external exchange our router through bitstamp.

Where is the best exchange to buy all these random altcoins, maybe I'll just throw 0.1BTC at each of them and see what happens?

Well played, I can't believe the LTC market over the last few days.
