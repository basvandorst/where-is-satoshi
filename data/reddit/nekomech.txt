How does one determine how many Brazilians are invested in Crypto?  The article links to a source that’s in Portuguese.

Do you require a money transmitter license where you live?

Me too, feels good man.  I wonder if we can nail down the average percentage from the ATH for these dips and set our buys accordingly?

Volatility between the buy and sell, unless there is a way to do it instantly that I’m not aware of

Where did the "infinity and beyond..." clue come from? I've been scrolling through this thread for 20 minutes and can't find it in OP's comment history either.

Sorry, I could have worded my question better for sure.
If it's meant to represent SHA256, which is 256 bits, I (falsely) assumed the numbers in your equation represented bits so I got lost as to how 256 bits + 1 was equivalent to 8 bits + 1.  Looking with fresh eyes, I now follow your logic. Thanks for taking the time to reply.

I don't quite get this part:


Wouldn't it be 257 = 2^8 + 1 = 256 bits + 1 ?

Could you share how you got those words, especially post, online, modify?  I came up with similar

personally, I need the money so I would sell half and hold half.
If I didn’t need the money and I already had other investments, I would hold 100%.
If I didn’t have any other investments and only 400k in bitcoin, I would probably sell some and diversify.

Nice I think I’ll post it now
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:54:46
I waited 5 days and reposted, it was downvoted so I don’t think you are right that it should be reposted regularly as it wasn’t received well.
@_date: 2018-06-03 03:28:12
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:35:58
Five.  I was told it should be reposted often but never given a time frame.
Edit:  the downvote implies this shouldn’t be reposted, right?

I live next to cheap hydro in WA... how much upfront cost would I realistically need to start mining btc and make my investment back in 365 days?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:53:13
Nah I’d buy at 2k all the way down to a cent.  I’m sure I’m not the only one.

Grin is a really interesting privacy coin project.  I just started reading about it but it looks promising.
