Bought several at $510. But i did buy some at $70 in mid 2013 to buy gear. The blackmarket is what introduced alot people to bitcoin.

I need some insight from you oh wise segarya. What is the real supply amount?

...Ive mined bitcoins its not limitless, you have no idea how it works. That's like saying there is a limitless supply of gold. If it was so easy why don't you just mine some?

Not to mention the blackmarkets on TOR are a [billion dollar industry.] ( Yes with a B, silkroad alone is estimated to have turned over $1.2 billion in revenue all with bitcoin. You can imagine the amount of bitcoins that revolve around the blackmartket &amp; people want to pretend it's not a huge part of bitcoin.

Because a wire transfer will take hours and a bitcoin transfer takes under 5 minutes to confirm.

Alibaba is where people buy stuff from china directly from factories and sell it to you goons on amazon/ebay for a profit. So yes if your smart you would start looking into Alibaba. It could absorb amazon if people would wise up and buy directly from the supplier.

You realize all of these things you listed are basically free with the exception of some services? Truecrypt was simply broken, there where many websites offering ways to break in, anyone who used that service was a fool. So now where talking about distributing information and this becomes illegal? These computer's are meant to break encryption i assume? Meaning their able to break most forms of encryption if where talking about x terahash/sec.

Who cares about the global blackmarket trade where looking at bitcoin sales here. And if you think silkroad is the only TOR market that is popular these days look again because silkroad is't even trusted anymore compared to the new markets like evolution &amp; agora. All am saying is the stake these blackmarkets have on bitcoin is huge &amp; much bigger than people think. And i highly doubt it was a mere $35-$45 million seized. This amount was just what silkroad had on site when silk road was taken down.
