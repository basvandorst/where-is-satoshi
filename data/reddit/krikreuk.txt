That's what I was saying before. That's why you absolutely need to have your coins on your wallet with full controls of your private keys before the split. So if shit do actually hits the fan, you'll have coins on both chains and nothing to worry about.
If its on an exchange it's not a HUGE deal (because most exchanges will most likely follow the winning chain) but you're taking an unnecessary risk. Depending on the amount you have, better be safe than sorry.

I'm not really interested in arguing hypotheticals to be perfectly honest, we'll see what happens.
I stand by my point though. A second chain being kept alive is a possibility, but the chances are slim. In the end it's all monetary incentives, and I can hardly see why people would stay on a chain that's worth less that 10 times the other if you want to take the Ethereum example, especially when BTC is mainly used as a store of value.

Well technically you don't have to trade anything as you'll have coins on both chains. At the time of the split coins on each chain will have the same value. Over time the chain that keeps the same value will be the winning one, the one that lost will substantially decrease/go to 0 depending on support behind it.

Coinbase has the private keys so no, you don't really own the coins left on the platform. It's more of an IOU for x amount of coins until you withdraw to your wallet. You'll be dependent of their decision in the event of a split.

Well, nobody said it was technically impossible to have bigger blocks and segwit. What you said in the previous thread was:


Just a bigger blocks one, then segwit later, as a compromise.
This however is technically impossible, as luke-jr said. 
I don't think you really grasp what Bip148/USAF/SegWit is, the "bigger blocks" definition for that matter, and the difference between a hardfork and a softfork. Again, most of the answers are in the comment chain you posted.

The reasons for the split were completely different (Legacy chain was forked to rollback on a "hack" and then kept alive by a part of the community, becoming ETC). ETH is the winning chain.
Worst case scenario it could happen with BTC and we'll have two concurrent, co-existing chains. But that's highly unlikely. The losing chain will probably lose all value and die as it's in no one's interest to keep 2 chains alive.

If all goes well on August 1st there will be no chain split.
If it turns sour and there's a split, as long as you keep your coins in your wallet (not an exchange or any third party, an actual wallet with control over your private keys) you'll end up having coins on both chains. You'll then just have to wait for the dust to settle and see which chains "wins" to resume spending/transacting.

The answer is literally in the comment chain you posted. Not sure what's the point of this thread.

Coinbase own TOS, under the section "Prohibited Use".
Also a simple google search will yield hundreds of examples.

Well it's a double edged sword. You could sell before to be "safe", but if all goes well Bitcoin will finally have it's long awaited scaling solution. Chances are price will skyrocket from there and you might regret your decision.
Diversifying your assets into other solid projects is a whole other topic but a good thing to do anyway no matter what Bitcoin will become after August 1st.

What happened to this old adage, "pics or didn't happen".
Don't have to reveal much if you're not comfortable with, just enough to prove that you're not full of it.

Poloniex stated the exact opposite, and I'm not sure what "bad faith" has to do with it as it's simply how the lending system works.
The real discussion is why doing this might be a bad idea and a huge gamble.

Buy everyday a little bit of every single dip till July 25th. Move everything to hardware wallet. Leave on vacation July 26th. Spend 3 weeks completely off the grid sipping Mojitos. Come back, profit?
(I'm not making this up, all is planned already).
