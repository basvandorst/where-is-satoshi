sounds like to me Bitcoin has an expiration date and isn't the "currency of the future" at all, then. Interesting.
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:19:04
would it really be calamitous? or would Bitcoin just switch hashing functions?

these all convert to fiat for you, i'm talking about a bitcoin economy where people never need to trade for fiat.  not gunna happen.  y'all should sell while you'll still get some money out of it lol

Just because someone tells you your Bitcoins are worth $1100 or whatever, doesn't mean they are.  As you try to redeem them, you will realize how quickly the price plummets as more get traded for cash.
What most people miss is that you cannot buy a house with Bitcoin, you cannot pay your bills with Bitcoin, you cannot do shit with Bitcoin except buy drugs and fake hitmen.
Don't link me to "LOOK HERES A 350Z FOR SALE FOR BITCOIN IDIOT" because you know that's not what I mean.

@_date: 2017-04-17 20:17:38
terrible analogy.  its more like when you get in someone's car, there's no confirmation of malicious intent until they swerve into oncoming traffic.
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:14:30
How is it confirmed malicious?  You have to intercept the server replies and see what's being eval'd
