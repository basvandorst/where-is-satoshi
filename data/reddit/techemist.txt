I'm in it for the protocol. Not the price speculation.  Just joking on the current price sentiment with that picture...

It's good to see companies who has been in payments for a long time start embracing bitcoin.

Market data was the main focus. Recently launched news. 
Will grow into a financial technology news portal with time.

Reading rumors about it but nothing solid. Who knows. Still interesting cause you don't often get to see a mine's setup.

You guys from NZ going to bitcoin south this weekend?

Seems like it's a 'wait and see' response. 
This is pretty typical. If the RBI directly steps in and does ANYTHING this means that bitcoin is a big deal.
Right now the market cap of bitcoin is so small and the trading done in India is less than 10k USD per week so nobody wants to do anything. 
But at the same time the decision makers are seeing the value and benefit of the technology behind bitcoin.
Good for you to organise a workshop! Don't be discouraged with the lack of information from RBI. Just get on with business and operate any activity like you would with any other businesses under Indian Commerce Laws. Book keeping etc. 
Also if your film maker is doing a doco about bitcoin, him contact BraveNewCoin.com as they would like to know about this.

Just an incredible lack of understanding of business, industry and technology in some of the comments following this tweet. Marc seems to understand that any distributed ledger (blockchain) is secured by rewarding stakeholders &amp; that a secure and large  blockchain is what gives the feasibilty/foundation for disruptive applications to exist. AKA you can't have one without the other. 
If a bank wanted a private blockchain for its own settlements - it would be nothing more than a spreadsheet unless it incentives record keepers (miners) in a clever and mass scale way - like creating a full node for each new bank account (and ensuring it's not just centralized into 1 pool).

Hi Manu
I'm Fran, The CEO of BNC where this article was published. Thanks so much for bringing this extra information to the community.
I've been talking to several companies about how similar bitcoin's evolution is to the early internet days and that the natural next step is consensus ie - standards for various use of this technology. 
You've pointed out something very interesting "Currently, there are zero Bitcoin organizations involved in the Web Payments work." - I'll work with Luke to reach out to a few core-devs to point this out.
Thanks again for contributing.

You do realise that this is a major win for bitcoin the currency? By securing the market data on its own blockchain technology it make the currency more transparent.

We made a widget/tool which does just that:
Paste in a transaction ID and receive back all the info including a USD market value at time of transactions. 
You can even export transaction into a tidy PDF.
API also available. 
Let me know any feedback.

Hello Bitcoin Friends
We have just suspended Houbi &amp; OkCoinChina from our indexing services. 
Fran Strajnar here - CEO of BraveNewCoin.com
Thanks for linking to us. I thought I'd chime in and shed some light.
What we're looking at here is the various regional indices and it's total volumes.
Some background on how we collect data and why:
Since we started the company we decided to 'track-everything'.
The price on the website is what we call the 'Global-Weighted-Avarage' or (GWA).
It is the weight price and volume sum of all our Regional Indices and is designed to be a global reference price.
We built this because we couldn't find any source that ensured us visibility across every single exchange, market &amp; currency globally. (as you all know this industry has grown at lightning speed! - there's now over 100 bitcoin exchanges globally).
The GWA has served it's purpose as a general global snapshot and we are now changing two things:
(all of our regional indexes and markets data will remain available on the site)
1 - (immediate) We have expelled Houbi &amp; OkCoinChina from both the CNY Markets &amp; GWA calculations. However we continue to collect their live trading data as part of our mandate to track everything. 
This industry is quickly maturing to the point where the currency and technology is about to explode globally and change the world forever. We must ignore market-participants who cannot contribute positively and transparently.
If these 2 exchanges can prove their volumes are 100% legit, we will re-address their inclusion. But for the time being - its gone too far.
2) We will be replacing the Global-Weighted-Average price as displayed on our website, apps and API's with a new index. This will take a few days. We spent the last 6 months developing a purpose built index for professional and institutional use. ie - something you can comfortably trust as true reference to settle money against.
Here is a snapshot of the new index. 
 
It's called the "Bitcoin-Liquid-Index" (BNC-BLX) and currently has 8 of the most trusted and liquid exchanges included out the 100+ out there. We will add an 9th, Gemini, once they reach our minimum liquidity requirements. 
The methodology was developed by experts from large NY based Indexing companies with heavy deployment assistance from big-data and infrastructure specialist to meet enterprise needs. 
The industry needs data to grow. That's our mission at BNC. 
If a person or company wants to buy a futures contract or derivative product - they need to trust the operator that their settlements are calculated fairly. We will hash the BNC-BLX on the blockchain so 3rd parties... or you... can verify that exchanges offering financial product are actually using/calculating the way they say they are... 
Buying a financial product powered by a blockchain should be handled better than buying financial products on traditional stock-exchanges. Bitcoin represents technology that can usher in a new era of transparency and accountability. 
Houbi &amp; OkCoinChina, do not meet the Liquid Index requirements either. 
The BNC-BLX is available today as a full historic database for superior technical analysis and for various application: 
It is also available today for Commercial/Enterprise use. It will be available for developers as a live feed through our API pages shortly (currently building this page!)
For anybody interested in early access or a spec sheet to this data-feed: please feel free to drop us a line on contact or subscribe to our newsletters through the site. 
I apologize to Houbi or OkCoinChina for any inconvenience this may cause and urge them to reach out to verify their trading volumes. 
I'll reply to any questions tomorrow (NZ timezone)

 I remember the days when people were still referring to the currency 'bitcoin' Lol.
 And when blockchain was only used by nerds and rebels.
 The days before the blockchain-powered Internet of things changed farming and manufacturing. 
Before we had companies like Blockle and MicroBlock whose smart contract based enterprise solution changed the very face of business.
 Now of course every country's central bank is run on its own blockchain. NGO's, not for profits all run their finances over proof of charity. Elections are voted on side chains and transparent. 
Just sold my old Mazda 27 on ebay. their sidechain handled the title transfer, as a service. 
To think We used to put up with centralized platforms dictating what data we receive from our networks/friends, like that Facebook thing that hardly anybody remembers now.  
those early years like 2015 were really the good old days ei?

Just had my second blockchain based 'a-ha' moment. First was after I first read Satoshi's whitepaper.

They can write a blockchain that is centralized. Any government or company can. They just need a function which allows them to control mining  permissions, then they can 'issue' out hash power. 
The entire functionality, including centralized structure, of a central bank, can be 'blockchain-izd'. 
The question is not if this will happen but how this will look like when some country finally does it.
