Ok.  I wonder how many people know that.
I sent a support ticket.  Thanks.
Is there fine print saying something equivalent to: your cryptocurrency is the sole property of GDAX?
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:25:44
I see.  Why would they withhold cryptocurrency sent to wrong addresses?  This reduces the reputation of the exchange in my opinion.

Ok thanks.  To clarify then, by sending the BTC to GDAX, I do not have full ownership of the wallet and hence the funds contained within without the private key.  Is this correct?
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:24:04
That makes sense.
So any of these crypto exchanges could hypothetically run off with anyone's money without fear of reprimand.

I see.  Can you send the currency to an outside source that you then own?
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:39:00
Ok.  I understand the concept of one's money being loaned out or used like with banks, but even if the address is theirs, the money is not.  If it is, then that doesn't make sense to me.  Nobody should use the service then.

My funds have been returned to the correct address.
I was able to get in contact with a Coinbase representative (GDAX is owned by Coinbase) and after a few email conversations, received this reply:
"I investigated further and have been notified that we are working on recovering funds erroneously sent to BTC or BCH:
If Bitcoin (BTC) is accidentally sent to your Coinbase Bitcoin Cash (BCH) address, we are working on recovering your Bitcoin (BTC).Likewise, if Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was sent to your Coinbase Bitcoin (BTC) address, we are working on recovering your Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
Please be patient, as this requires engineering and security effort and coordination.
We recently enabled a Bitcoin (BTC) feature called SegWit, which uses a different address format. Going forward (beginning 02/13/2018), if you send Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to your Coinbase Bitcoin (BTC) address, your funds will not be recoverable.
Please exercise caution when sending BTC and BCH, and make sure that you are sending them to compatible addresses.
If you made a send from Coinbase and mixed up BTC and BCH, you may be able to recover those funds, but we will not be able to assist with this.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. For more information, see our Bitcoin Cash FAQ.
Thank you for your patience!"
As long as your situation is one of the two quoted above, and happened before 2/13/2018, then I don't see why you wouldn't receive a refund too.  Try emailing them in a respectful tone with the email you made your account with.
I hope this helps others!
