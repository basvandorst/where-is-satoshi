Bro think about it, if Bitcoin price was $100 per coin, all the way up to 20 million coins, then there has been 2 billion dollars of fiat money "real money" that has entered Bitcoin. 
Then suddenly demand sky rockets, and people are willing to pay $100,000 per bitcoin. 
Well the market cap would then shoot up! 20,000,000 coins x $100,000 = 2,000,000,000,000 (2 trillion).
But 2 trillion dollars worth of fiat "real money" didn't flow into Bitcoin, only 2 billion did. THATS A HUGE DIFFERENCE. 1000 times smaller. 
So the amount of money that is soon to enter Bitcoin, won't be linearly correlated with a market cap increase.  1 trillion dollars entering Bitcoin doesn't translate to a market cap increase of 1 trillion dollars. It would be much higher.
So if you think there is approx 1 trillion dollars of global wealth out there that will be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, then market cap will be enormous. 
And as we know, the price is determined by supply (people/miners willing to sell), and demand (the amount of value people want to store in the Bitcoin blockchain). It's not determined by the amount of money that has been spent on Bitcoins.

Sell your ETH it's worthless. How it's still at ~$300 is outrageous! Rip that bandaid off now, you'll be glad you did. Then go listen to some skeptical questions about ETH and the whole project always falls apart, this extends to the vast majority of ICO's and Altcoins. Bitcoin is THE blockchain.. THE cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin &amp; Markets. I've listened to all these suggested (except Bitcoin uncensored) and no one has mentioned Bitcoin &amp; Markets by Ansel Lindner. 
For a podcast with a relatively small audience, it's got some great insights, and he forms a pretty good narrative to accompany market updates, a bit of gold and traditional markets (only a little) 
At the moment it's the podcast I look forward to the most. He's on twitter too, but his podcasts are better. It's a bit technical, but not a lot. I recommend you've had &gt;1year of bitcoin experience/research under your belt.

It was 'our money', so even if she doesn't understand bitcoin, she has the right to half. So it's not as outrageous as I made it seem haha.

To be fair it was our original plan. It's just that hindsight stings so hard haha.

I sold half my BTC at $1075 at the start of this year cos my gf made me take out our original investment once it doubled for 'safety' *exagerated eye roll* but was still stoked with that price!!!
Still got 20BTC, should still have me sitting pretty once we're orbiting the moon. But it could've been 40btc. Girls.. *face palm*  that's some reverse FOMO for ya.
