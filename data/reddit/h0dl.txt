Oh Vinny please:

isn't it then reasonable to assume protocol around BU to improve as well?
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:54:21
Great name

That's such a gross distortion of the regression theorem which states that a money must first establish value as a widespread accepted commodity before it can become a money or SOV.

Apparently the major 0.8 chain split in March 2013 wasn't reviewed or tested either by anyone other than Mike Hearns. How does that happen?

"We optimize for production readiness by focusing on simplicity, security, and robustness as the important characteristics, **as opposed to** other offerings missing clear security characteristics or even **lacking any commitment** to immutability or fundamental attributes like the total money supply or consensus algorithms."
So wrong.

Wouldn't making up addresses like that make them instead just stealable as opposed to unspendable? They still have a balance.

which happens to have many real world examples of highly successful companies like Uber and AirBnb going out and grabbing market share (increasing numbers of users) with loss leaders so that they can become market leaders via the network effect.

Or just use the cash to buy Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:16:43
Is this supposed to be good news? 
@_date: 2017-01-28 16:49:37
do you blame them considering the brow beating that goes on here?

What do you mean had to use ssh? Your above command doesn't work for me in Sierra.

Well, once we get rid of Adam and Greg, we can realize our vision. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 16:49:23


even an attacker would want complete information to maximize his chances of an attack.  so even he won't prune.
@_date: 2016-09-25 15:45:03
uh, you do realize that UTXO commitments represent a large computational issue for the network don't you?  even outlined specific reasons why this was hard.
@_date: 2016-09-23 16:09:22
an implemented centrally planned "new" consensus rule w/o consensus.  got it.
@_date: 2016-09-23 18:50:21
uh, do you realize that UXTO commitments are just a figment of one's imagination right now and not proven to work?  Bitcoin has gotten along just fine w/o you and your schemes, so get lost.
@_date: 2016-09-23 16:28:48


because miners see themselves as the accountants of Bitcoin.  and rightfully so.  they won't and shouldn't prune.

*If it's an existing input that was previously spent, you cannot actually, if someone claims oh I'm spending this particular output, how do you go prove that the input wasn't there?*
@_date: 2016-09-26 15:54:43
you started with the preposterous presumption that miners should prune their nodes.  if anyone in the system shouldn't do that, it's the miners, who are the accountants of Bitcoin.  since they are the only one's who get paid to do that task, they should and will keep the entire ledger b/c storage space is cheap.  guys like you who don't understand how we got here want to change/distort/pervert the original system.  not gonna happen.
@_date: 2016-09-23 16:12:02


yes, i submit that no miner would want to prune their mining node.  that would be crazy.
@_date: 2016-09-28 16:06:37
why would anybody want this?
@_date: 2016-10-04 03:03:18
@_date: 2016-10-13 17:32:03
seems like any mention of Satoshi support invokes attacks? 
@_date: 2016-10-02 18:32:02
such bullshit
