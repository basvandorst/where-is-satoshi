Could have been worse, at least you did not buy a tattoo.

I think it will be a success.  Eventually there will be Aurora/BTC exchanges.  Iceland will get bonuses for being the first to nationalize a cryptocurrency.

Some are mining on future value, not present.  The earliest miners also had to wait until the market caught up to sell them.

Those little boxes couldn't possibly demand 2.1 kW.

And they're not hoarders, they are savers.  Saving is something we as a country should relearn.  "Hoarders" either got their coin for paying for them or mining them, adding value either way.

I'm going to guess Second Market.

Seeding the emerging markets is a good use of those coins.  Better than being locked up by some hedge fund manager.

How can it not be?  At least not one of the state run crypto currencies.  All the features missing from Bitcoin will be on the "more civilized, less audacious" state-coins, like state issued keys, reversibility, total traceability, no paper, UV ink QR codes in the wrist or forehead.  A fascists wet dream.  
The old bar codes literally do have a 666 at the ends and middle.  The scanner calibrates on that 6 6 6.  Do those three blocks in the QR code do the same thing?

Any Marklin fans?  I used to have HO Marklin train sets.  Wanted to be a train engineer at 7 already.
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:14:27
Yeah, on Russia Today.  But anyway it is germane to Bitcoin because BRICSs bank, was made to bypass the petro dollar and US dollar.  Less reasons for people to hang on to dollar investments.
@_date: 2014-07-24 02:17:39
Don't think of it as 0.100 BTC your buying.  You can get more excited about 100,000.00 BIT for $62.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:30:38
That's not the point.  Bitcoin still is limited to 7 transactions per second.  Also there will be national currencies in bitcoin format like the Aurora coin.
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:11:59
Now figure out how physically big that hard drive will be.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:20:03
Peercoin and Zerocoin (if it's ever minted).
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:19:20
Two blockchains?
@_date: 2014-06-18 17:31:01
It should be the symbol for the Bit not the BTC.
@_date: 2014-07-17 02:06:33
That's right.  One German fellow I know did not leave his property for more than a few hours at a time.  Renting as you go is probably best for most working people.
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:12:36
It would be.  Let's get through that confused period early then.
@_date: 2014-03-11 14:49:36
By far a better deal than .5% in a dollars or the stock casino.  I like gold to but bitcoin has that affect to.
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:33:27
Imagine getting a QR tattoo and at some time losing the key or hacked.
@_date: 2014-06-18 17:57:04

Nobody is getting ahead with mining. Just buy.

Ixcoin I believe.  Just like bitcoin but fully mature in a few years.

If that was going to happen it would have happened by now.  I thought FATCA was going to be a driver but appears not to.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:10:07
I think Namecoin is that system and it's already merged with Bitcoin.
My intuition tells me Namecoin is a sleeper.
@_date: 2014-09-21 18:53:48
Two possibilities.  Bitcoiners are usually metal bugs to and may be jumping on discount silver and gold.  Also Alibaba IPO may have sucked out some of the wind.
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:01:38
Capital flight.  Super-national corporations.
@_date: 2014-02-09 09:18:27
Liquidating the FBIs big stack and those other big whales breaking up is very good for the long run and a second chance buying opportunity.  The longer the flood the better to.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:23:04
Wells Fargo, with Coinbase, has worked well for me.
@_date: 2014-09-20 02:09:41
Alibaba IPO, and maybe cheep precious metals buying could have diverted incoming money.

Let's hope not.  Still too many bed wetters here.
@_date: 2014-09-20 05:16:51
Evolved from what?  I'd say bitcoin is an invention.  The Wright Brothers invented powered flight, it did not just evolve just because of some prior musings.
@_date: 2014-03-11 14:13:51
'Saving' is another.  So saving is bad now?

I thought FATCA was going to do it so I am at a loss.
@_date: 2014-09-19 02:26:07
Because silver and gold are looking good perhaps.  PM trading volume has and is increasing.
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:08:23
It's no longer a small group of miners but many many miners now scrapping for tiny bits.  Frequently at above costs to.
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:42:06
I think bottom is going to be around New Years @ $200ish.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:43:49
30,000/3600=8.33 days of mining.   Not insignificant but should not move the market that much.
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:56:49
Thank goodness didn't get near MtGox.  That's toxic anywhere I suspect.

You forget to remind us how bitcoins are just like tulip mania of Holland.

Coindesk is a good place to get news.  This is a discussion site about bitcoin and this looks to be a more popular thread.

No, try again.

Somebody has to.  For techies, the challenge of making things work brings great satisfaction.  It's a challenge.  You are a pioneer.  Self education.

No, those keys are encrypted and Ross has not given them the key.  Likely those coins will never move again.

You're high.  Bitcoin will do nothing for inequality.
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:34:45
Illegal for the little people.  It will be the currency of the mafioso, oligarchs, banksters and apartchiks.

Maybe the point of the email leak is price fixing.
These coins should have been auctioned off in 100+ lots.

You're high.

Altcoins will complement, not compete with, Bitcoin.  Some coins will have special markets.  Bitcoin is limited to 7 transactions a second, so others will needed.  Bitcoin will be the gold standard though.
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:33:50
The love of money is the root of evil.  Bitcoin will not make the world a better place, sorry.  Stick it to the bankers, sure, but greed is still greed.

Future appears closer than it is.  Ditto for sidechains, ripples, and other exotic ideas.

Also, this fall in winter, Difficulty will be so astronomically high that the kilowatt-hours required to mine 1 BTC will easily exceed $1000 even on the most newest and most efficient rigs.

The Cyprus banking crysis blew a bitcoin bubble of its own, so this is relevant.

I'd plunk $1200/BTC if I were in the billionaires club.  If  Andy Warhol's silkscreen can go for $100M a large pile of bitcoin can be $1200 surely.

Hand written in indelible ink.  Perhaps brail even.  Safer from roving scanners.
