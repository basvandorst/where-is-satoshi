Well, if you want to be exact, the biggest reason why we use specific currencies is because you need them to pay your tax and that they're considered legal tender. This adds a pretty enormous amount of value to them. But ultimately, you only get benefits of a deflationary currency versus an inflationary one if you aren't putting it in a bank or investing it. I think for the vast majority of people, that doesn't apply. Most people don't keep huge amounts of savings in cash.
As for your side question, my point is more that deflation creates disincentives to investing. Investing carries an inherent risk. If you perceive your value going up with a "sound" deflationary currency, why not just keep your money in that? The more it goes up, the less reason to invest, and of course that makes investments even riskier. (Thus, deflationary spiral) So yeah, you can put your wealth in bonds and stocks in a deflationary currency - but it's likely a bad idea.
Anyway, I've got to sign off for now. Good discussion. Have a good one.

And what is your measure of "confidence?" Published data on new exchange signups indicates that they are down substantially from peak. 80% of BTC have never been moved from the wallet they were mined to. The vast majority of retailers convert their BTC to USD as soon as they get it. The market is *still* very illiquid, so even relatively small sales can cause 'flash crashes.'
From my perspective, confidence has not risen. If the price if Bitcoin is a measure of confidence, then it's still down substantially. And moreover, it's not clear to me how "confidence" decreases volatility. If there's no intrinsic value to your product, you cannot expect the price to stay stable.

Well, thanks to the magic of probability we can figure out what the odds of a cataclysmic event are. Yes, seven asteroids could hit the Earth and then never again. Just like how you can flip a coin 100 times and it'll hit heads once and then tails the rest of the time. But we were talking about probability, and given the length of the Earth's geologic record it appears that very large asteroid impacts are rare.
Even if Andreas' numbers are correct, $500m is a relatively small sum for a nation state. And 51% is not a "weak attack." Bitcoin operates by consensus, and with 51% you have the power to modify much of the protocol. You can make a new rule that no transaction is valid unless 10% of its output goes to a particular address and refuse to confirm any transaction that doesn't conform. Blocks that don't conform to that rule will be rejected by your pool, and since you have 51% they will all eventually be orphaned. You could move the decimal place. You could refuse to confirm any transaction that comes from an address that has received a mining reward, thus making mining completely unprofitable.

Bitcoin can never be vulnerable to inflation, because nothing is priced in Bitcoin. I'm still not seeing the scenario in which Bitcoin displaces existing legal tender currencies.

If the Federal Reserve were to introduce a digital currency, it would probably be for internal use by banks (to transfer sums among each other) and they'd be directly convertible to USD. There would be no reason for banks to introduce it to consumers, since it'd have little value to them in such a form.

The original post suggested that Bitcoin cannot be tampered with by anyone. This is false. Suppose I'm the Fed, and I want to take over Bitcoin in order to manipulate it to further my nefarious statist ends like I do with traditional currencies. This does not require a free energy machine and an incredible budget. It requires a large budget. I can do many things with 51%, as I described earlier.
A hard fork will only occur if my new rules create transactions that are invalid with the rest of the 49%. Otherwise, a softfork will occur and my new 51%-powered blockchain will orphan the old blockchain. To illustrate:
Imagine I gain 51%, and I create 2 new rules for all blocks that I create:
1. No transaction may be confirmed unless 10% of the total output goes to a specific address under my control.
2. No address that is not under my control may send any transaction if it has ever received a block mining reward, unless that address is on a particular list of addresses I control.
I then instruct my pool to ignore all blocks that contain any transaction that violates these rules. Because my hashing power is greater than the rest of the pool combined, the 49% will eventually have their blockchains orphaned. All of my new blocks are compatible with old clients, so my longer blockchain will always be accepted. Since their mining rewards are no longer spendable, my control over the network will strengthen as other miners drop off.
Switching to a sidechain to just "mine with a new algorithm" is not trivial, and I would probably be able to 51% a sidechain with very little effort. There is also no software update that can solve this issue, since I can simply modify my pool to become compliant. I can also coerce clients into accepting greater protocol changes by denying all transactions that don't conform to a specific client that I release.
Thus, the idea that Bitcoin is invulnerable to government intervention is totally false. Also, the idea that a 51% attack is weak is totally false.
Please go back to the wiki and learn how the blockchain works.

Bitcoin is more vulnerable to speculation because it's not backed by physical useful assets or a taxing authority. If you haven't noticed, it goes up and down for no particular reason all the time. Suddenly it spikes to 1200. Then it drops to 1000. Now it's close to 600. There was no underlying change in Bitcoin's value proposition. There was no actual reason for these changes. They just happened.
Bitcoin will always be inherently volatile. Until it has the backing of a taxing authority or it's indexed to a useful asset, it will continue to be so. There's no price that "makes sense" for a pair of crypto keys.
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:28:52
That's a bit misleading. Bitcoin moves the actual funds faster, but that's not necessarily useful for every business. If I have a low cash reserve business, I might care a lot about that. But if I depend on volume, I really just care that the transaction is processed and I'll get my money within a few days. Credit cards authorize near instantaneously, which is something that Bitcoin can't offer. For a high-volume business, Bitcoin's propagation delays can translate to a huge amount of lost money. That's why Bitcoin isn't really a great POS solution.

QE is not the same as printing money, and I don't think you really have a lot of evidence to accurately measure how much value is "siphoned" off versus how much is created by the monetary stabilization QE has caused.
Anyway, you're wrong about Bitcoin's suppy. Bitcoin's M0 (the actual physical bitcoins) is limited at 21m. However, the M2 can expand essentially forever by simply eliminating reserve requirements (this is going to eventually happen anyway). Hence why, fully developed, bitcoin markets can very closely resemble ordinary markets. Moreover, Bitcoin's maximum is not actually immutable. Because the protocol is decided by 51% of the hash rate, government intervention could simply move the decimal point over and essentially print tons of new bitcoins. Or they could create a BTC 2 chain and declare by fiat that both currencies are equivalent.

Investors that purchased shares thanks to his affiliation might not have if, as Andreas now states, his involvement was more limited than the company claimed in its promotional materials. If his involvement was greater than he now states, it leads us to wonder why he did not act on his knowledge prior to Danny's flight from Cyprus. And it is completely fair to ask if he had a financial stake in the company that might have led to a conflict of interest.
I think it's unlikely that Danny Brewster tossed a few coins at Andreas as he fled the country. But that doesn't mean Andreas was not partially at fault. He should give more insight into Neo and his role in particular.

Friendly fraud is when a person makes a transaction, and then later attempts to reverse the charge by telling their credit card company that they never authorized the charge. This is rare for POS and it's unique to credit card transactions, because you cannot chargeback other forms of payment.
Credit card fraud - wherein a person claims they are someone they are not in order to spend a victim's money - is not solved by Bitcoin. If you are able to get access to a private key, you can simply clean out the account. If it's later found that stolen coins purchased goods at your store, you still have to give the money back by law. You don't get to claim 'finder's keepers.' If the goods they purchased are the kind that can be returned, you'll get it back. In whatever condition it's in. Otherwise, you have to eat the cost of the fraud.

It's not about protecting citizens from financial risk. China pegs its currency to a basket of currencies, which it views as critical to preserving its trade regime.

Wrong, wrong, wrong. You're missing the point entirely. 
If I take a cash transaction and it's stolen money, I have to return the money. Just like Bitcoin. That is the EXACT REASON why credit card fraud causes payments to be reversed. You don't get to keep the proceeds of crime ever, no matter what the payment form is. Bitcoin offers NO PROTECTION against this except making it easier for criminals to mask the location of their ill-gotten gains.
Bitcoin is like cash in that it prevents FRIENDLY FRAUD, which is when a person claims a transaction was not authorized by the card holder when, in fact, it was.

@_date: 2014-03-06 04:32:56
You're not correct in a number of ways.
First, you may have to force your customer to wait because the payment needs to propagate through the network before you can even see if the Bitcoin was actually sent. This can take several minutes and happens prior to even a confirmation. Many retail establishments only make money on the volume of their transactions, so even a 10% slowdown can cost them a lot of money. Coffee is a big example of this - you're grabbing coffee before work. You don't have time to wait 10 minutes.
Second, for larger purchases (i.e. if I buy a big screen TV at Wal-Mart), a double-spend attack is actually trivial and could even be automated. That's what confirmations are meant to protect against. That's why they are there. But it's not really acceptable to have customers wait around for up to an hour for their transaction to confirm, even if their transaction is "only" several hundred dollars.
Bitcoin is not suitable for POS transactions. I mean, that's just how it is. I get that people want it to be used EVERYWHERE, but its strength isn't in buying coffee. It likely never will be because Bitcoin is decentralized, and decentralized systems tend to be slower.
Edit: For people saying chargeback fraud/checks bounce/ whatever. Yes, that's true. But those systems have a web of financial regulation that keep fraud low. The "web of trust" in our existing financial systems is what allows them to be speedy from the standpoint of the consumer. Bitcoin eliminates that trust by design, but the tradeoff is speed. That just has to be accepted as an immutable property of Bitcoin.

The "wealth" everyone had as a result of the loose capital controls wasn't real in the first place since it ended up being a liability that sank the banks. You're right though, the state did consent to it by refusing to intervene while the banks took on riskier Greek loans. That was a failure by the regulators. But minus all regulation, that *still would have happened*. Private businesses can fail. Some private businesses failing can cause greater harm than others, as in the case of these banks.
And whom would the Central Bank be warning? The central bank is saying that Bitcoin is a risky investment and folks should be cautious about using it. But the public didn't loan money to Greek businesses. It was a small group of bankers that essentially collapsed the Cypriot economy. In my opinion, the Cypriot government can be accused of not doing enough to stop the crisis, but the greatest problems come from the EU, which encourage loose capital control, and foreign bank executives that crafted extremely risky financial instruments and caused the entire thing to fall apart in the first place. For the most part, Cyprus was just along for the collapse.
As far as frozen assets - yes they are mainly frozen, but the question is whether funds were *stolen*. The original plan was to have folks lose 5%+ of their deposits even if they were insured in order to capitalize the banks. This was, of course, absolutely outrageous since they had zero input on the entire mess in the first place and it was mainly bailing out foreign investors. The Cyprus parliament rejected those outright predatory terms and a new deal without the levy was put in place.

What problems are you referring to?
Here's the thing. Non-electronic systems can be manipulated. It has been manipulated many, many times in countries all across the world. With smaller manipulations, it is virtually undetectable. Electronic voting is *more secure* than traditional methods of voting if properly implemented. A hashed signature of stored results, pre-election audits, and a paper trail ensures that the system is as verifiable as a paper system while counting the votes accurately. It also contains numerous accessibility advantages.
We do a pretty good job of counting votes here in the US on paper. But printed ballots have a few disadvantages. For one, is it is demonstrably superior to be at the top of the ballot - electronic voting can randomize and eliminate that advantage. Various voting systems can be confusing - thousands of paper ballots are thrown out each year from people who do not fill out the circles correctly so the machines fail to read their ballot or  inadvertently place identifying marks on the ballot. Many ballot designs, such as the infamous butterfly ballot in the 2000 FL election, made it very difficult to figure who you were voting for. And if the ballot is two sided, the drop-off rate skyrockets.
Electronic voting makes it substantially easier, presenting each choice step-by-step and preventing the voter from making serious unintentional errors. If you are disabled, such as blindness, it offers ways to read the ballot without having to rely on a poll worker or friend's honesty in filling out your ballot for you. It's a great innovation, but that does not mean it's perfect. I'm pretty big on security, and I think many states have implemented it in a fashion that is somewhat vulnerable to malicious attack. But to say it suffers from "many, many attacks" paper systems are designed to protect against is false. Electronic systems with paper trails are superior to paper systems are detecting fraud because they are redundant. Both of the numbers must be fairly close to each other or manipulation of evident. Paper systems can have votes thrown out, or the workers hand counting the ballots may systematically miscount votes in favor of a particular candidate. It's possible to simply misreport vote counts by modifying a spreadsheet with the paper system (this has happened by accident multiple times in the past few years). So, I think we do a good job but it's also not at all perfect.

As far as counterfeiting goes, I would remind you that the Bitcoin has its own security issues.

This is an interesting perspective for me, even as I'm not exactly bullish on Bitcoin's longterm prospects. But there's a big difference between the desirability for an alternative currency and proof that Bitcoin is that superior alternative.
To wit: there is not, as of now, a system for exchanging Bitcoins in a secure way without usage of a bank or intermediary. In that sense, an Argentinian without a bank is not exchanging their local currency to bitcoins in a much more secure fashion than currently exists. And, of course, god forbid you live in an area without substantial internet coverage. I still remember my time in Nepal. Internet connection was entirely through very, very slow connections at Internet cafes. Imagine the equivalent of 56k being shared by a dozen computers. You can *barely* get cell coverage if you climbed on the roof. Obviously, in a place like that, Bitcoin is largely useless.

1. Yes, you can verify your vote was counted. In the US at least, the SoS records every person that votes and ensures that the number of voters = the number of votes. This is recorded as public record.
2. It would not remove it. Requiring access to a computer or smartphone would disproportionally impact minority voters. It also does not solve the issue of *voter registration*, either. Nor does it remove the perception of voter fraud, because you cannot guarantee that a voter is eligible or has not been coerced into voting one way or the other. Unlike the current system, crypto systems are pseudonymous. 
3. You only have several months to vote after a primary. It would never be 24/7/365. Nor do I see how this is desirable - voting in 2010 for a 2012 election is absurd.
4. No, this just means that money is more valuable in elections. You need more of it to run more ads all year.

Well, it gets a bit complicated then, doesn't it? If I encrypt the private keys, then I have to store the key to decrypt the private key somewhere safe. So that offers additional layer of protection from robbery, but obviously at the end of the day it's not exactly a big endorsement for being your own bank if you have seven layers of security and your house is full of SD cards. (This, of course, ignores bitcoin-stealing malware that simply circumvents your safeguards the moment you actually try to access your money) In a true bitcoin-centric economy, you would still outsource this rather cumbersome process to a bank rather than the digital equivalent of money-in-the-mattress. This is actually a requirement for bitcoin to 'go mainstream' unless you want it to be a financial trail of tears for anyone over 35.
The bigger problem is that you can still lose the second key, or you could end up in a coma and your relatives can't use your money to pay your medical expenses. Security doesn't just mean from thieves. You also need to be able to access that money. The more steps you add to secure from thieves, the more difficult it will be to avoid losing the money forever. That's a problem unique to bitcoin.
As far as street transactions go, that process is *not* secure. First, within a few seconds you merely get an alert that the bitcoin transaction has been propagated. A double spend attack is still possible. Or they can mug you for the cash you're carrying after you send them bitcoins. Or the cash could be counterfeit.

It works fine for small transactions, where the risk of getting caught substantially outweighs the benefit.

Electronic voting is actually very useful. It offers accessibility options to help the blind, deaf, etc vote. It's far more accurate than any other voting method we have yet devised. (As an example - see Virginia in 2013. Herring lost the AG election on election day, but won after the recount found dozens of new votes in areas that utilized paper ballots but were missed by the counting machines. The rest of the state used electronic voting, and their result did not change.) The key is that the machines need to leave a paper trail and go through proper security measures.

I don't think pensions are scams. Obviously, employees die and the pensions stop paying out. It just depends on the size of your pensions versus the overall revenue of your company. It also requires some careful planning to run over a long time. Sure, there's a non-zero chance that your pension will fail - that doesn't make it a scam, no one ever said "this money is absolutely guaranteed." A stock offering isn't a scam because over a long enough time period the company might not turn a profit. Social Security isn't a scam just because one day the government might collapse from civil war.
USPS isn't being killed by pensions, by the way. Yes, they are held back by Congress' really stupid rule requiring the pension be pre-funded for *75 years*. It's also held back by rules denying them the ability to use their significant retail presence to offer new services to customers, like banking services for the unbanked or selling cell phones - all while Congress mandates that they turn a profit.

Because the financial burden provided by intermediaries that enable the giant financial web-of-trust has absolutely nothing to do with the actual costs. It comes from the cost of complying with regulations, insurance, providing consumer services, maintaining a network, and handling/securing cash deposits.
Now, you're thinking "but with Bitcoin, I pay almost nothing to send money from one place to another!" That's true. But that's because you're not paying an intermediary to handle that cash for you. The moment you add an intermediary, especially once Bitcoin is regulated, there isn't much reason to think the costs would be lower, or at least much lower, than a traditional transaction.
Keep in mind, the actual financial world isn't a whole lot different from Bitcoin in the sense that the amount of money in my bank account does not reflect an actual dollar in a safe somewhere. It's just a number. The difference between the Bitcoin world and the financial world we mostly live in is that in the Bitcoin world, your ledger is protected by nigh-unbreakable encryption. In the financial world, it's protected by a large series of regulation and serious criminal penalties. The relative ups-and-downs of this are fairly obvious. The financial world is faster, but with greater overhead. The Bitcoin world is slower, but with greater inherent security. Bitcoin might be appropriate for certain transactions, but it does not make traditional financies obsolete.

Everything is finite. That's not really a strength. Arguably, it's not even really particularly finite because tomorrow the US government could create a "BTC 2" cryptocoin and just denominate all BTC 2 as equivalent to BTC. Or they could fork the Bitcoin Foundation's code, then just set a bunch of supercomputers onto the network and change the protocol unilaterally to move the decimal place over one spot.
Anyway, it makes sense. Just think about it. Let's say you have a business selling sporks. It costs you $0.20 to create each spork, which you pay in USD to your plastic mold supplier. Now, you decide to accept Bitcoin. Since you pay in USD to create each spork and you're worried about volatility affecting your profitability, you peg the value of each spork in BTC using a script that polls the current value of Bitcoin from exchanges. Now, since you need USD to pay for your sporks, you have to convert your BTC back to USD to keep your business flowing with cash. And you have to pay your employees in USD due to payroll laws. And then you have to pay your taxes in USD.
So you sell your BTC back to other people in exchange for slightly more USD than you started with, and sell more sporks to BTC users. Well, except that the BTC was always worth whatever the sporks are worth in USD. They're inextricably related to each other. This is how all BTC businesses operate. Virtually no one is "BTC only" and if they are they are still priced by how much of another currency is required for their inputs.
So, let's go back to our spork business. If the USD dropped in value 90%, what would happen to the price of our sporks in BTC? It'd rise by 90%, because the price is based on the USD input rather than BTC input.
Of course, speculation will always impact BTC price in large ways, but the economic fundamentals demand BTC work in conjunction with the rest of the world economy. It is not like gold, seemingly immune to rises and drops in currency prices.

This approach (Simple Payment Verification) is described in Satoshi's original white paper. The drawback is it ends up making Bitcoin very centralized.
The thing is, you're thinking, OK what if we did what the credit card companies do, except we do it for a lot less? Then it's still cheaper than credit card transactions. Credit card companies do charge a lot, but building a transaction network requires more money than you think. It also requires a level of trust between vendors and the bank, which as of yet does not exist in the BTC infrastructure. It's hard to say if the end result would actually be cheaper than credit card fees. The existing solutions (i.e. Coinbase) are already not really super competitive.

Uh, no. You just exactly proved why fraud is not fixed by Bitcoin.
Let me put it this way. If I steal your credit card, I need to convince you that I'm the rightful owner in order to get you to accept it. If I succeed, I committed credit card fraud. Once the card is reported stolen, the transactions will be reversed and the merchant is out the cash. Bummer for them.
If I steal your Bitcoins, I don't have to prove I'm the rightful owner. I only need a private key and address with sufficient Bitcoins for you to accept them as my money. If I go to Target and purchase stuff with those Bitcoins, and law enforcement trace the coins, the merchant has to give back the money. Bummer for them. Same fraud. Fewer protections. The only "benefit" to Bitcoin is that it makes it harder for the victim of fraud to retrieve their money because laundering is so much easier.
To put it another way - if fraud weren't possible with Bitcoin, no one would be trying to hack exchanges and we wouldn't care about cold storage.

It has been abandoned. Not a single country in the world uses the gold standard. 
As far as price, maybe you'd prefer the more precise term "value?" That said, both changed. Gold was not, at least since the advent of banking, "the currency." Gold was a thing (sometimes not the only thing) that backed currencies. Nobody went around paying for their groceries with gold (legal tender coins with gold in them excepted). This is a big difference because the value of the currency could change if the amount of gold in reserve fluctuated and the ratio of gold-to-currency holdings changed. Moreover, you can't forget that it gets even more complex once you have bimetallic currencies with variously different laws on how that actually works.
I think a lot of people have sort of a rosy view of the gold standard, thinking it was a time when you'd head over to the bank and get a big sack of gold for your dollar and that's all that mattered. In fact, it's got a pretty complicated history and it caused a fair number of problems that have largely been solved by today's (imperfect as they still are, being human constructs) currency regimes.

I think most people would agree there's no general rule about how much inflation should happen, because it's dependent on economic conditions. An export-oriented economy would probably prefer more inflation, and an import-oriented one would prefer less. That said, why wouldn't you want something like 1-2%? It's low enough to prevent people's savings from collapsing underneath them or cause serious economic distortions, but high enough to create incentives to spend money and invest. That's a generally accepted rule of thumb, although obviously different economies have different requirements.

You're asking: how would the blockchain know what my coins are worth if they're off blockchain? It wouldn't. You'd need the exchange to keep track of that, or keep your own meticulous records.
In terms of tracking your own transactions: as long as you know which are your purchases and which are transactions to yourself, you can figure out your capital gains. Simply polling price history from the exchanges is enough.
Now, if you want to track each and every fraction you've acquired: that's the easy part. You don't have to. Since the coins are placed into a single wallet, you can simply spend your coins and declare them to the IRS in order of whatever will give you the least capital gains burden first. For example, imagine I buy 10 bitcoins at $100, $200, $300, $400.. etc. All my bitcoins are in one address. The price then crashes to $500. I spend one bitcoin. I then declare that my $1000 bitcoin was the bitcoin that was spent to the IRS and claim a $500 capital loss, thus negating a substantial portion of my taxes.

OK, first, the poor are net debtors. Inflation reduces their real debt level.  The middle class are net debtors too, but they have access to long term investments that offer greater returns than inflation or bank accounts. So deflation would hurt these two groups the most, but they would benefit the most from inflation. Yes, you can't save money *right now* and beat inflation, but that's because the fed has set very low interest rates.
Second, the issue here is the distribution of newly created wealth. (Income) The problem is that the total share of income is going upward, and wages for workers are not going up. This is unrelated to inflation. This is because of distorted policy choices that fail to counteract the natural tendency of wealth to concentrate in a capitalist system. In fact, they make it worse, since capital gains taxes are so low.

Honestly, it's very rare for a court to rule for a defendant on a "technicality" on cases like this, especially if the law is not very clear. If the court has to create law, they're not going to go with "yeah sure run a multimillion dollar enterprise facilitating criminal transactions!"

"Fuck America" doesn't matter. If you do business with US banks, you're liable to get your assets seized if you violate US law. The fact that banks have not yet cut them off doesn't mean a whole lot. The Treasury Department can, with only probable cause, freeze financial assets and seize the deposits. This has been done before with something as minor as Internet gambling, which is a much smaller issue to the US government than *money laundering*, as that is considered a threat to national security. Most governments of the world also look down on money laundering (especially Russia, because that money can flow to armed terrorist groups within its territory) so honestly if the US opened up a case against BTC-E you'd see that exchange lose its money pretty quickly.
It's pretty easy to beat US regulators in the short run. They tend to be slow to react and are strapped for resources. But in the long run, if you really piss them off and they want to make an example of you, they *will* fuck you over.

I think you're incorrect about it being bad for the goose. It just changes your incentives for the sake of preventing currency from being hoarded under people's beds. You can keep it in a bank (who will then loan it out) and they'll give you enough interest to cover inflation so long as inflation remains reasonably low and steady. Or you can invest in bonds, stocks, or other economically-important activities. I don't think that's bad for the goose. In this case, it's good for both the goose and the gander. The goose gets greater returns and a growing economy, the gander gets the benefit of the goose's money circulating.
In that sense, deflationary currency provides no advantages to most people. It's only advantageous if you want to exclude yourself from most economic activity, or you perceive traditional currency as being doomed within your lifetime.

Since bitcoin doesn't prevent fractional reserve banking, governments have a lot of tools a their disposal to expand the money supply. Too many people have a naive understanding of how central banks manipulate the size of the money supply - they have a number of tools, they don't need to just run a printing press.

I understand the protocol. The fact that it's possible to double-spend as a fundamental property of the protocol does not change the fact that a currency designed to allow trustless irreversible transactions does not. Satoshi's original white paper specifically notes that Bitcoin is vulnerable to this issue prior to the first confirmation. The issue OP has presented is that the double spend attack, previously considered impractical, can in fact be trivally exploited by utilizing txn properties many pools consider non-standard. The fact that you cannot fix the problem without forking does not mean that it's not an exploit.
Bitcoin was designed for a person to wait for a confirmation. If you choose not to do so, then your payment system can be *trivially exploited* using non-standard transactions to make your payment far less likely to be confirmed before a double spend. That's a protocol and security issue. Some altcoins have done a better job at mitigating this attack by having shorter confirmation times or utilizing PoS.
And to me, claiming that it isn't a vulnerability when there are currently real world applications that are exploitable by this is absurd. This can be considered not a problem when double spend attacks fail at least 99% of the time. Not when they literally succeed every time you attempt them.

Thank you for this. A lot of people don't understand the blockchain or how powerful a 51% attack really is. There is nearly limitless power as long as your changes are excluding transactions. You can setup all sorts of rules - for example, a "Tobin tax" where only transactions that send 1% of every output to a particular address are confirmed. And if your grip on the network grows even greater by killing off competing miners, you have the power to coerce everyone to something like a sidechain you control.

YES it is a bug. It's an unintended drawback from the implementation of a txid, and of course there's not a lot of point to a transaction id that changes. There is a workaround, but it's slow and doesn't 100% fix the issue because it takes time for the network to figure out which transaction to confirm and which one to ignore.
MtGox should have done a better job, it's certainly not a good exchange, but they actually handled this problem better than their competitors. They identified the issue and implemented workarounds before anyone else did. The folks unloading on them are irrational - the press release they put out ended up being an accurate assessment, not FUD.

"Legal tender" means that a currency has the force of law backing it. If you say that I owe you $20, and I give you a $20 bill, that constitutes payment for the debt. In other words, the act of declaring a currency legal tender compels a merchant to accept it as payment. However, as Article 1, Section 10 of the US constitution states:
"No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility."
In other words, you cannot mint money or declare an alternative currency as legal tender. You can declare gold or silver coins as legal tender, but the only authority that may mint those coins is the US treasury. Utah "took advantage" of that to declare those gold/silver coins the Mint sometimes creates as legal tender. However, you'd be paying the face value ($1), not the actual metal value, which would be much higher.
California's law accidentally made Bitcoin and other alternative currencies illegal to use at all, which was never the intention of the California legislature. It's no surprise they're reversing it, because there is no reason for it to be criminalized.

1. It doesn't work exactly like gold. Gold is immutable. Bitcoin is not. Bitcoin's protocol can be changed by consensus. Gold can never be changed. Also, the vast majority of gold is used in jewelry and industrial processes, so it has intrinsic value that Bitcoin does not have.
2. Bank runs are about confidence in the bank's finances, not confidence in money. If you doubt money, a run on a bank won't help you. Anyway, traditional currencies have value - they are necessary to pay taxes and settle debts.
3. The question is if Bitcoin's value is due to speculation that it will become more valuable in the future or because of actual demand for it as a currency. Most bitcoins are immediately converted to dollars by merchants.

Sorry, I'm right. Cyprus had a huge amount of money sheltered by overseas businesses and individuals. Much, much more than the average Cypriot's deposit. In terms of actually outright losing money, many honest folks did lose it. That comes with a bank failure (if a US bank failed, you'd lose all non-FDIC insured deposits as well). They are also negatively affected by the withdrawal limits. That was the great scandal about the levy-on-deposits proposal - it was pushed by predatory EU countries in order to save foreign accounts from losing their money by funding them with Cypriot citizen deposits. The people of Cyprus, of course, were not too thrilled about the idea of losing their money to give directly to foreigners using their country as a tax shelter.

If this were purely about economic incentives, there would be zero supply to meet a very high demand. Helping people is an intrinsic reward that can't be calculated economically. You would eliminate basically all of the community aspect of the website.
And, of course, the "pay for questions and answers" model has been tried on other websites many times. It just doesn't work. People aren't willing to pay enough for small amounts of information to make it worthwhile or be able to support yourself. Instead, it just robs people of their intrinsic motivation. In my own industry, which deals extensively with volunteers, we found this out. We used to offer rewards (t-shirts, stickers, etc) in exchange for X amount of hours of work. We found it reduced total output as people would get to the first tier and then it stopped being fun for them.

Saying "gold was used for thousands of years and people are still alive" betrays a total lack of understanding about gold's history and why it abandoned. In fact, it was abandoned (and returned) many, many times throughout history, or switched to bimetallic standards, or had the ratio of gold to currency adjusted. And when the price of gold significantly changed, it would have dire impacts on economies and necessitate further adjustments.

1. Almost nobody actually follows this rule, though. It's just a fact of life. It'd be nice if everyone did, but they don't. Web security needs to take that into account - that's why 2FA was invented. Passwords in general are a poor method of security, so a website that advertises "bank-level security" should take into account that the weakest link in any secure application is the user.
2. Security questions are stupid and insecure in general. Remember that Sarah Palin's yahoo email was hacked because her security question asked what high school she went to. Turns out you could find that out on Wikipedia. (And pretty much anyone's facebook) All the hacker needed was her name and personal email address to reset her password. However, since Coinbase can't get rid of security questions, it can at least start by not disclosing real names with email addresses.
3. Phishing and social engineering are the easiest attacks and most inexpensive to pull off. They are pulled off by organized crime groups that have a lot of experience, and much of what you might want to do is packaged into easily purchased crimeware.
Bottom line, it's a security issue. And a privacy issue.

Txid was designed to be, as it says, a unique ID for each individual transaction. Bitcoind and many custom Bitcoin implementations use it to verify if a transaction went through and credit an account with Bitcoins. The advantage is that this is faster and more reliable than looking at inputs and outputs 99% of the time. Rarely, a double spend will invalidate one of the transactions. This was regarded as being a small issue and it was thought that, since it was documented, people wouldn't rely exclusively on Txid. That was false. The key issue is that the Bitcoin network is relatively slow while the demand for quick transactions is very high, so exchanges and wallet services tend to look for shortcuts and decide not to worry too much about the very rare edge case which would take larger CPU resources to detect. The mass double spend attacks turned that edge case into a liability and ground many services to a halt while causing their ledgers to become inaccurate. Rather than continue trading, they have decided to suspend and allow for the developers to create a system to track individual transactions in the blockchain without having to resort to a slower workaround.

Satoshi is tortured and murdered for his private key: A Good Thing for Bitcoin?
Hi Everyone,
Long time Bitcoin fan here. I think there's been a lot of people freaking out about the imminent threat of torture and murder by criminals against Satoshi Nakamoto. I know folks are nervous.
But I just wanted to remind everyone that Bitcoin is still in development and hasn't yet matured the sort of structures that would prevent someone from being brutally maimed, possibly amputated limb by limb, in a desperate attempt by a down-on-his-luck crackhead to obtain his massive stash of BTC. Yes, the murder will be gory, and a lot of people will be upset that it happened. Some people might even commit suicide. But it seems like no one even cares about the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto's imminent and painfully slow demise might, in fact, be a significant milestone in Bitcoin's eventual mainstream adoption.
Bitcoin has grown significantly since its creation. This meteoric growth has made it a target for criminals, and right now security systems are always one step behind. There are a lot of BTC holders out there keeping their BTC in an insecure location, such as their home, a safe, their office, or a bank. They've slowly been losing their BTC to robberies, trojans, government seizures, etc. As the pile of insecure Bitcoin holding shrinks, the overall security of Bitcoin becomes higher. Satoshi's possibly week-long torture, which will no doubt involve dozens of different methods derived from medieval torture techniques, at the hands of any one of his millions of enemies (government agents, dogecoin holders, cops, journalists, criminals) will encourage folks to think about better ways to keep their BTC from being stolen. In a way, it's just another step on the way to making Bitcoin a mature platform for financial transaction.
Anyway, that's just my two cents. I hope everyone has a great week.

They are certainly more likely to be more expensive in the short run, given how many years of development have gone into miniaturizing current technologies. That said, the best available hard drive technology has each site at about a dozen atoms so there's not a whole lot further we can go with magnetic mass storage. And other technologies need to do better than just be cheaper per TB - at some most adding more storage becomes mostly pointless if you cannot increase i/o speeds, which is a big limiting factor of any sort of optical medium.

Being able to track a transaction from its beginning to its end is a useful function.
The best metaphor I can think of is a delivery company.
Imagine two buildings - a UPS delivery store and a warehouse to which UPS delivers. The manager at the warehouse creates a system whereby the UPS store calls him in the morning and tells him what will be delivered. Each delivery is in a separate truck labeled with a number.
One day, the UPS store informs the warehouse manager than they will be delivering items to the front of the warehouse in 100 trucks, each numbered 1-100. The manager waits outside the front door and crosses them off as they come in. He then goes into his system and adds those trucks to his inventory.
Now, the next day, the UPS store calls the manager again. They're going to do the same thing. Except this time, a malicious ex-employee snuck into the warehouse in the middle of the night and changed the instructions on the deliveries. Now some of the trucks will go to the BACK door, and some will go to the front. This means the manager gets all of his deliveries, but doesn't realize that some trucks ended up unloading in the back door. They aren't checked off. Now he has to check both the back entrance and the front entrance to ensure that his deliveries are arriving. This takes more time than what he used to do, and it's far slower.
The "fix" would be the close the back entrance so that all deliveries must come to the front. Then you can safely continue using the old system without having to check elsewhere. You save time, CPU resources and money. Without having to significantly change underlying basis of Bitcoin.

The Cyprus government wasn't responsible for the bank's failure. It was a private bank. Their involvement comes in their failure to employ stricter capital controls. When things were going fine, they were OK with it. Their neighbors were OK with it too, because they got access to cheap offshore loans from their neighbors. But someone should have realized that the exposure to events beyond their control was much too high. 
The global recession, sparked by Wall Street, caused the chain reaction that blew up Cyprus. Greece's poor governance imploded their economy, taking the Cypriots down with them. Once Cyprus' banks collapsed, and with the country mired in a recession they didn't cause, the government had basically no way to finance their debt and thus bailouts.

Well, I could name off three currencies, but that wouldn't be helpful. Let me put it in terms of three separate items. Two are fundamentally different from Bitcoin, one is the closest analogous real world object (and probably the greatest argument in favor of its eventual success)
The US Dollar is a currency backed solely by the taxing authority of the US. That means that there is a fundamental demand for them - because virtually all economic transactions are, at some point, taxed by several different authorities that must be paid in USD, everyone needs them. It's also been declared legal tender, which gives us more reason to use it. Finally, the US is a substantial exporter of goods and services. To purchase an item from a US company, you need to buy USD first.
This is what makes the US dollar valuable. It also creates an *intrinsic value*. As long as US goods and services are purchased and it remains backed by American taxing authority, it will continue to be valuable. This helps protect the USD from the wild volatility and speculation.
OK, so that's the first one. The second example is natural gas. Natural gas is fairly volatile, as all energy prices are, but not so much Bitcoin. Anyway, it has intrinsic value from its energy content. It can be used as fuel. This, again, helps protect it from volatility. There is plentiful information on what natural gas costs to produce and we can reasonably predict future demand for it for many years in advance. That information allows investors to determine when the price has gone higher than what its value would suggest and deflate brewing bubbles.
Finally, my last example is gold. Bitcoin attempts to emulate this by design. Gold is unique because it's backed by thousands of years of tradition and not a whole lot else. Contrary to common belief, however, gold is still used for industrial processes, dentistry, and jewelry over investment on a 4 to 1 basis. This means that even gold has intrinsic value. Still, the price has been shown to move based mostly based on interest rates and 'safe haven' status.
Unfortunately for Bitcoin, it has no intrinsic value. Nothing is priced or taxed in Bitcoin, so unlike USD, I never actually need to own a Bitcoin. It is not backed by an asset like gold, natural gas, oil, wheat, or whatever, so I'm not actually buying a share of a valuable asset when I purchase Bitcoin. It doesn't have any of the advantages of gold, either. In fact, there isn't any reason for Bitcoin to have any particular price at all. OK, so it was 1200. Now it's 600. So what? What is Bitcoin's actual value? How much does it cost to make a Bitcoin? If I own a Bitcoin, what value will it generate for me beyond a speculative fortune? Instead of 600, why not 5000? Or 20,000? Or a million? Or $1? Or $0.01? The price is completely arbitrary. It makes no difference what it is worth. Even if everyone declared tomorrow that they were using Bitcoin, I fail to understand why that would make Bitcoin worth 600 times a US Dollar. (Note: It's not even a guarantee that BTC will only ever have a certain number of Bitcoins. A protocol change requires a mere 51% of the network.)

Authorizing just proves the account is valid and has funds. If there's fraud, then yes it can be rejected later. That's not great for the merchants (and the laws ought to be changed to force credit card companies to take the hit on fraudulent purchases) but it's a huge feature for consumers who are obviously the biggest victims in these cases.
Because these cases are relatively rare, fast transactions vastly outweigh the relatively rare incidences of card present credit fraud.

Neither Bitstamp or MtGox are/were fully compliant with AML/KYC laws. Gox, in particular, literally had millions of dollars seized for failing to comply with US laws. Bitstamp has a shell company in London, but it hasn't gotten the proper licenses still to operate outside of Slovenia. Nor has it registered with FinCEN despite serving US customers. BTC-E, however, is just an outright criminal enterprise. You can say "blah blah FUD" til your face turns blue, but it's only a matter of time until American authorities take action against them and seize their USD assets. You'll then be yelling at evil governments ruining bitcoin during this 100% predictable event.

There has been a red blinking light for months coming from China. People that could tell what it meant have been selling. Everyone else has been left holding the bag.
China clearly believes Bitcoin adoption is a threat to its currency and capital control regime. So they will, eventually, end it. The fact that they're doing it slowly could just be to allow some of the firms to reduce their exposure before it's gone. That's all there is to it. They don't operate like US authorities - there isn't months of public debate followed by a policy change. They just quietly implement a policy until completion.
If one exchange is gone due to authorities, the others will eventually disappear as well. Smart money would divest.

The fact that they're small really works against them. Just the threat of cutting off a bank would be enough for legitimate banks to close their accounts. They just become a liability then. Look how easily Wikileaks was effectively blocked off from the American banking system. I would say that maybe no AG would care enough to devote resources, except FinCEN is mailing compliance letters out, which is of course precursor to greater action. (See: MtGox)
Accepting EUR still cuts them off from American customers. And it's not unlikely that European authorities would eventually follow the Americans. BTC-E is especially vulnerable since there isn't even a fig leaf of trying to follow the law. I think authorities would see it as a budding money laundering scheme rather than a legitimate exchange.

You didn't understand what I typed in the first place. Bitcoin is *not* substantially different from traditional currencies. There are two fundamental differences between them: Bitcoin uses a distributed, rather than a shared, ledger. It also prints new money into the system by algorithm proportionally via hashing speed rather than the variety of systems a central bank would use. However, the vast majority of systems that exist in the regular financial world would exist on top of Bitcoin as they exist on top of the physical dollar. A fully developed BTC market would not function in a substantially different method than our current currency system.

If you put more money into Bitcoin then you can afford to lose (i.e. you'll be homeless or have trouble eating) then you should get out now. Take the losses and lesson learned. It's not worth that sort of risk. Just remember that the regrets you'd feel for selling before it went up is nothing compared to the regrets you'd feel holding onto Bitcoin if it dropped to $1.
If you can afford it, then evaluate yourself. Are you going to be the sort of person who will enjoy watching it go up and down? A lot of speculative traders *enjoy* that aspect. Just like gambling, it adds excitement. Other folks feel enormous pressure and depression when their asset loses money. If you're the first type of person, then don't worry about it and have fun with the ride. Hopefully, you can absorb any losses just fine. If you're the second kind of person - please, for the sake of your emotional well being, divest. Find a safer investment. Or go have a nice night out.

I can tell the difference between a fractional dollar and a real dollar right now. No blockchain or public ledger required. Any money you have in a bank account is a "fractional dollar." Any physical dollar you have is an actual dollar. However, they have equivalent value. Why? Because if you trust the bank and believe your deposits are safe, the convenience more than makes up for the very low risk. Plus, both of those dollars are legal tender and can be used to pay your taxes.
Currency value can be lowered by expanding the monetary base by more than what economic growth would demand. In general, you want monetary growth to keep pace with economic growth. Keep in mind, though, that this is often only indirectly controlled by a central bank by manipulating interest rates. For example, if I dump $500b into a bank's reserve, it won't do a single damn thing to the monetary base if the bank doesn't loan out any of that money.
By the way, sometimes lower value currency is *desirable*. The Swiss, in particular, were nearly crippled by their gold standard as their currency became too valuable to remain competitive in international markets.

1. If your username has ever been on a compromised website in the past, there's a good chance (unless you're one of the very few in the world to *actually practice good security*) that you shared a password. Giving an additional bit of information allows additional data points to be used to break into your account. For example, if your account data was dumped in the Sony break-in, your full name could be referenced against a broken hashed password to get into your account.
2. Coinbase accounts can be reset using email. With a full name, you can find a person's social media account and attempt to answer the security questions on their email account. You get into their email, reset the Coinbase, and then get a bunch of Bitcoins for your trouble.
3. Social engineering/phishing becomes trivial when you can use full names to lure the user into thinking they received an authentic email.

Bottom line is this:
There are several traditional investment vehicles. The first are securities: stocks, bonds, etc. These pay interest or dividends. They have intrinsic value backed by the security of their money-making ventures.
Then you've got commodities. These tend to be more volatile, but commodity-related securities are also popular speculative vehicles. Oil, coal, gold, wheat, etc all fit in here. They are used in industrial processes and are scarce resources, so they will always have some intrinsic value.
Now, "currency" is not usually considered an investment vehicle. Yes, you can speculatively hold onto currencies and trade them as you would anything else. But currency is impacted by many unpredictable factors and it's both risky and expensive. But the key thing is that when we talk about currencies being risky, we think of maybe 10% swings the wrong way. It's very rare to see a currency collapse, unless it's a very small and fragile economy. That's because they're backed by the taxing power of the bank issuing the currency.
Stocks go up and down based on company performance. Bonds can default. Import/export fluctuations can manipulate demand for a currency. Commodities can be impacted by supply shocks. But Bitcoin has no country that denominates in it. There is no tax authority that accepts it. Therefore, there is no real price pressure either way. It goes up and down and *there is no rhyme or reason behind it*. The market is extremely illiquid, so even if it does go down, there's no guarantee it's not just some guy dumping Bitcoin to literally anyone that will buy it.
So, Bitcoin is a poor investment vehicle. It's extremely unpredictable and does not follow a rational market trend. If you want to roll the dice, then keep your Bitcoin. If you can't handle the pressure of whether or not you're going to lose all your money, then I suggest you sell your Bitcoin now. Avoid the "sunk cost" fallacy of keeping your money in Bitcoin because you've already lost some of it.

This isn't what we're talking about. A blockchain maintains its integrity by being public and accessible to everyone. If you turned it into a voting system, that essentially means each address is assigned to an individual voter and you can identify how any single person voted. Using the blockchain in this fashion offers no advantage over a centralized solution that publishes the same information, as modifying such election results would be immediately obvious.
As a political professional, I think electronic voting machines are very, very useful. They count votes faster and more accurately than the old systems. However, many states have not passed legislation to ensure that they are secure as they should. There is no reason not to include a paper trail, or ensuring that they go through regular security audits. That said, there is really no reason to believe the 2004 election was stolen due to electronic machines. Virginia and Ohio continue to use these machines, as an example, and Democrats have won 2/3 statewide elections in Ohio and 3/3 of the last statewide elections in Virginia. Moreover, it's not as easy to manipulate results as claimed. You'd have to penetrate many machines (which are not usually networked) over a large geographic area before the preliminary results are reported, which is not a lot of time. We also did not see large swings in expected totals from various precincts, or a mis-match between the number of voters and the number of counted votes. Without those telltale signs of manipulation, it's hard to believe 2004 was stolen.

I agree that the blockchain size will not grow out of hand from cost of storage perspective. I think it will grow too large to work with, though, unless faster i/o solutions are found. The real problem is if the blockchain outpaces the size of magnetic mediums and there aren't alternative storage solutions available that are fast enough to be usable to conduct transactions. That would require immediate solutions. I don't really see that being an actual issue any time soon, though. It will take a long time for the blockchain to even reach 1 TB - at least ten years, unless the 1 MB limit block limit is lifted.

Bitcoin's volatility isn't due to its age. It's because it has no taxing authority or assets backing it.
They're right that Bitcoin sucks as a currency right now. That's why the vast majority of merchants that accept Bitcoin immediately convert it to their local currency - there is no reason to ever hold it, it's just risky. Maybe if it were less volatile, it would help, but there are still other questions (such as: what will transaction costs be versus credit cards when mining finally begins to slow down?) that need to be solved before it's a good for transactions.

A trusted network on top of Bitcoin is the *exact equivalent* of a trust network built on top of cash. You get all of the original drawbacks. The difference is that the web-of-trust is facilitated by federal regulations and guarantees. Those do not exist for Bitcoin (and most users would likely find them undesirable).

Great. Except retail makes money by the volume of their sales. You can't sit around on Black Friday with people waiting around for their $1500 in Christmas presents transaction to confirm or be released. Every extra minute spent between transaction and checkout is money out of your pocket.
Yes, a $1 cup of coffee isn't an issue. No one really cares about that. But larger transactions *must* be done quickly or it hurts the bottom line.

Honestly, bitcoin is too difficult to use for a layman. No amount of software abstraction will change that, as the steps to merely safely store money in it are absurd. 
Bitcoin cannot "go mainstream" without adoption by banks to add a layer of security and ease-of-use that otherwise won't exist. So, no, it's not a threat. It's literally a necessity.
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:32:41
Well, until the day the last bit of gold is shot into the sun, I imagine we can never truly say it's "dead." But the same could be said of a silver standard, a copper standard, or a rubber standard. I will say that as far as I know, there has never been a time since the advent of banking where every industrialized country has abandoned gold at once.

Uh, no. What your graph shows is that wages are not keeping up with economic growth and worker productivity. If you tracked non-inflation adjusted earnings, you would see that they *still* are not keeping up. That means inflation isn't the culprit. If it was, don't you think we wouldn't have any economic growth at all? Unless you think some people are just flat out immune to inflation? And why do you think wages are not keeping up with the rate of inflation even as the economy grows faster than it inflates? Your interpretation holds no water at all.
Here's the real problem:  and
Money is being made, it's just increasingly being held by a very small percentage of holders of capital assets. The systematic gutting of labor laws over the past few decades have allowed wages to remain stagnant while corporations and shareholders take larger and larger profits.

Satoshi is tortured and murdered for his private key: A Good Thing for Bitcoin?
Hi Everyone,
Long time Bitcoin fan here. I think there's been a lot of people freaking out about the imminent threat of torture and murder by criminals against Satoshi Nakamoto. I know folks are nervous.
But I just wanted to remind everyone that Bitcoin is still in development and hasn't yet matured the sort of structures that would prevent someone from being brutally maimed, possibly amputated limb by limb, in a desperate attempt by a down-on-his-luck crackhead to obtain his massive stash of BTC. Yes, the murder will be gory, and a lot of people will be upset that it happened. Some people might even commit suicide. But it seems like no one even cares about the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto's imminent and painfully slow demise might, in fact, be a significant milestone in Bitcoin's eventual mainstream adoption. 
Bitcoin has grown significantly since its creation. This meteoric growth has made it a target for criminals, and right now security systems are always one step behind. There are a lot of BTC holders out there keeping their BTC in an insecure location, such as their home, a safe, their office, or a bank. They've slowly been losing their BTC to robberies, trojans, government seizures, etc. As the pile of insecure Bitcoin holding shrinks, the overall security of Bitcoin becomes higher. Satoshi's possibly week-long torture, which will no doubt involve dozens of different methods derived from medieval torture techniques, at the hands of any one of his millions of enemies (government agents, dogecoin holders, cops, journalists, criminals) will encourage folks to think about better ways to keep their BTC from being stolen. In a way, it's just another step on the way to making Bitcoin a mature platform for financial transaction.
Anyway, that's just my two cents. I hope everyone has a great week.
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:43:03
That's idiotic. Traditional currencies (I prefer this to "fiat" because Bitcoin is not substantially different from a "fiat" currency in most respects) are not similar to a pyramid. There is a product (the ability to pay taxes and settle debts in a universally agreed-upon way, determined by law). Additionally, *all* capitalist economic activity relies on value being added to the system. 
The day that growth stops happening will be extremely problematic for the existing structure. Bitcoin is just as 'vulnerable' to that as anything else, because in the end it buys into, rather than rejects, status quo capitalism.
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:01:11
It would be nice if they took out exchange addresses, but even then it has some implications.
It does help explain why Bitcoin has a very low transaction volume on both exchanges and straight address-to-address transactions, but maintains a very high USD price. The market is dominated by just a handful of financial interests.

Yep, uninsured deposits were lost when the bank was closed. The same thing would happen if a US bank failed. Although this kind of bank failure is rare in 2014 (especially since you can generally expect regulators to take action to protect consumer deposits), it's still possible. It's especially possible when the Cyprus government literally lacks funds to even pay for insured accounts.
The Cyprus problem is mainly due to greed from larger countries. It would have cost them virtually nothing to restore Cyprus' banks, but they bowed to internal political pressure not to "bail out" foreign EU periphery countries even though German-dominated capital policies were a huge part of the issue in the first place.

Decentralized voting systems aren't appropriate for developing nations. Many African nations have spotty records as to who is actually a citizen, making it difficult to figure out who should have access to a blockchain-equivalent of a ballot. There is not always a network or computer available for use. Recording a person's vote leaves them open to coercion or retaliation.
Typical fair elections utilize indelible ink applied to an index finger (to prevent voting multiple times) and a paper ballot placed in a transparent container. When the election ends, the votes are then counted in public, the results are reported, and the ballots are transported to centralized storage for verification. This low-tech method is far cheaper to implement, especially in rural areas with extremely poor infrastructure.

I've heard this floated about, but the real question is - why would you want to? Bitcoin is pseudonymous, whereas voting depends on being able to match an address with a single, particular person. 
Even if you used something like signing with a private key to get around this, you still lose another essential Democratic feature - the privacy of one's vote. At that point, you lose the entire purpose of the blockchain. It would perform no better on any standard than a centralized system that published how everyone voted.

Well, we aren't going to sustain that exponential rate as our hard drives reach the density wall. There's a 1 Tbit/sq inch limit, and it's non-trivial to simply increase platter size. So, don't be surprised if you don't have a 1 petabyte hard drive in 2020. Maybe 60 TB. Maybe.
That said, I'm not sure what Bitcoin's blockchain growth rate will be. I'd imagine working with a 1TB dataset would start to become challenging.

The people with the clients have to agree - except the folks running the clients will not have their transactions confirmed unless they switch to a 51% complaint version. They cannot access their Bitcoins until they do, because the remainder of the 49% will never have their transactions placed into a block. Those blocks will eventually be orphaned. In effect, they can simply make all non-complaint transactions non-standard.

1. I'm talking about electronic voting, not necessarily blockchain technology. There is no necessity for the secret ballot being removed.
2. You have no idea what you're talking about. All industrialized nations of appreciable size use machine voting. Hand counts take weeks to do, it's extremely expensive, and it has a higher error rate than many types of machine counting.
3. Yes, without end to end verification paper ballots can be miscounted. FL 2000 is a good example of this - the same stack of ballots were counted by many different organizations and each one got a different result. In close elections, this can make the difference. The idea that ballots have "multiple observers at all times" and stuff like that is just hilariously misinformed. That's just not true. I'm not saying fraud is common, but I am saying that paper systems are vulnerable to manipulation. Hell, virtually every election of any scale has a few ballot boxes that go missing for a few weeks before they're discovered.

You can change the excel sheet, but it's very easy to verify that people's votes were recorded incorrectly. For one, political parties spend a large amount of time identifying their supporters in order to turn them out to vote. Individual voters can look up how their vote was recorded as well. If your country/state has voter registration, you can also check to see if everyone was actually an eligible voter.

This provides no protection against double spends. Real world retail is a very bad use case for bitcoin - I could walk into a Best Buy, buy 2k in hardware, and walk out with a receipt after no one ever confirms my invalid spend. And there's no situation where a store can reasonably force you to wait until it clears.
With online retail, you can just wait to ship until the money is in your wallet.
