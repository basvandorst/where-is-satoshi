I'm not sure I understand, but he was going to use bitcoins to buy credit card numbers? Guess the guy will get bitcoins somewhere else, but *thank-you* for not funding that enterprise.

I'd love more pointed instruction/direction. 
Think I just sell these things and take the loss. Have found a lease that will mine whichever coin is hottest per 24 hours. Then convert to btc and there you go. I still have a lot to learn.

Going to give this a shot, hope I can ask questions if needed?

I don't get how altcoins will coexist with bitcoin? 
Any advice / general thoughts appreciated.

Having worked tech conferences I can say that you'd probably hate working any of the booths. 
Unless they have booth babes and a keg of beer.

bitcom_CTO, huh? maybe you should log off reddit and go do something about the current bitcoin prices. less posting more value-ing!
(actually please keep driving them lower like we agreed. once i buy those coins we talked about with the fund you setup then put the plan in action. if you agree either don't reply or reply and act like you don't know what i'm talking about)

I propose a 2GHz USB miner be elected CEO. Hell, make it the CTO as well.

How to avoid fraud should be Chapter 1. The paypal hack could be the Bonus Chapter. 
before starting with your guide i put on the bitcoin scammer hat and thought of how to ripoff people following your system. just a thought. 
need a writer for your site?

whatever you come up with will be gamed. no work will be done and the btc ATM will be empty in a week.

Simple. Just explain to the twerp the difference between teaching and doing, and also make a joke about their hair or clothes. 
The more people that tell me I'm crazy the better.
