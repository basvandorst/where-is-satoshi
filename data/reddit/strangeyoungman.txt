How DO you get obsidian to build a portal to the Nether? I keep smelting cobblestone but all I get is smooth stone.

Yes that lightning. Pretty major stuff there huh. How they did that thing which is a big deal. What do you think about it? And what are your thoughts on why it happened. And what will be it's implications?

That is one half assed bttf DeLorean. Where's the mr.fusion. where's the flux dispersal coils. Wheres the female plug in which you plug in the lightning rod. What kind of monster gets a DeLorean and does this to it

He came off being an asshole but redeemed himself in the finale. Probably a second language thing.

I think i generated my wallet through one of those. how do I verify that i can access my own wallet without having to perform transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:01:12
thanks i'll look that up

dang. one of the pitfalls I guess. the "official" logo seems to be tarnished now.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:58:03
so ELI5 bcash?
from what I've read, they're kinda scammy. can they use the popular bitcoin logo like that and make bcash seem like they're officially affiliated?

Maybe location? Could have a giant sinkhole opening up to the 7th plane just outside the frame of the photograph

Why would anyone want to "fork"? How will their fork be recognised or accepted? Will multiple forks devalue Bitcoin?

I think that's one of the ways these exchanges can stay afloat. That and transaction fees. Maybe coinbase has no transaction fee? I'm using Luno which also takes a small percentage of my fiat money before converting it to BTC.

I see this abbreviation a lot and still have no idea what it means. Also FUD.

Which exchange can I buy lightning network from
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:37:17
I've seen that being done in Uncharted and maybe the Frostbite engine. That was when I was convinced that we're in the future.
I find it amusing that just 20 years ago, prerendered cutscenes in Final Fantasy seemed like the best thing ever. Now they're all done REALTIME.
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:36:14
What gave it away?
Edit: I just realised that out of context, this comment sounds sarcastic. But in my industry, when you can't tell something is real or rendered, then that's something we can use to learn to create more believable renders
