well, there really is a way to buy bitcoins at 6% below the current mainstream market rate. It's just about whether or not people would firstly believe it, and secondly be ok to wait for bank processing times and if so under what circumstances?

Everyone seems to be asking this. Different countries have different laws. as a guide, in Australia it goes like this:
You can sell as many bitcoins as you like without capital gains tax if the PURCHASE of those bitcoins didn't cost you more than $10,000 at the time of purchase. 
In Australia they don't look at BTC as laundered money. But they charge capital gains tax on the amount you earned if you originally invested more than $10,000. 
each country is different. You will find specific laws by googling it or asking your tax agent. there area a few that browse these forums too you might get lucky.
It looks as if they treat it as just another income from regular currency exchanges on the FIAT (regular currency) market. If you invested them for the purpose of making money by selling them due to inflation then it's a captial gain and will be taxed as such.

Well if you were buying bitcoins and the seller asked you to make the payment and wait up to 48hrs for the funds to clear is that a reasonable thing? If you were allowed to pay with paypal would that make a difference?

Well there's no bitcoin enforcement agency haha my friend, you are unfortunately on the receiving end of some assholes playing hardball with you. Never underestimate a persons cunning when they are haggling over something they are emotionally attached to. You gotta up your haggle game my friend! or do what I do and just walk away from them. They don't deserve your money if they are going to be assholes and suck the joy out of purchasing bitcoins. I can sell you a bitcoin for $5659.84 *AUD* FLAT with no fees on top if you like. I don't play dirty. Life's too short. I price to sell.

I've tried to word this question so it's detached from any ideas of trying to advertise a service, but lets say I can buy bitcoins for a decent percentage off market price and want to sell them, but i have no capital and need to put the buyers money into the exchange to be able to get them their coins. Is that a good or a bad idea to try and sell bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:03:06
because they are selling at a bit cheaper rate than any exchange
