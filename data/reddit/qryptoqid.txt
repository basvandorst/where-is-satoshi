*Uhh, uhh, sir, I'm gonna have to push back on you there. [I don't think cash has ever been used for nefarious purposes.](  Furthermore, we here in the United States have the strongest anti-money laundering regulations in the world and [we're working every day to make sure that the dollar is never used for illicit activity and that banks participating in illegal activity can not access the US financial system.](  And of course, we are doing everything possible to ensure that the US financial system is never used to fund [terrorism]( and that [terrorists]( go to jail.*

Those banks are all stupid.  Some guy on this site called Reddit told me that since it has taken institutions a long time to get in, then that means they never will.

"Amazon of China"?  Really?  Alibaba, the retail *giant* is too obscure?
@_date: 2019-03-15 01:49:52
That's a deep pull!  Well done, sir

This reminds me of *Team America*, where every time they introduce a new location, they display how many miles it is from America.  Paris, France; 3,200 miles east of America.  Panama, South America: 2,100 miles south of America.  North Korea: 5,900miles west of America.

This is the quality of journalism that is telling people, with a straight face, what to--and what not to--invest in.  These are the same people saying Bitcoin is the future, and also saying Bitcoin is dead.  
Just let that one simmer in its own juices a while.

Thanks, I needed a laugh

No shit.  He says loudly and often that he looks for companies that have a moat.  There's few moats better than a hundred years of regulation entrenching your business and industry behind an unassailable castle.  You're hardly some sort of genius for investing in companies that 1) everyone has to use to be a functional member of society, 2) can't be competed with thanks to nearly insurmountable barriers to entry, and 3) can not go out of business except under the most ridiculous cases of criminal negligence.

People borrow language from similar fields to express somewhat comparable ideas.  They're not exact comparisons but act as a convenient short-hand for those who are new to the space.  To someone new to Bitcoin, saying "a fork is like a stock split, but..." gets a person 80% of the way there.
As crypto matures a new lexicon will evolve that better represents what is going on.  Feel free to offer better alternatives.

That's not nearly as clever as you think it is
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:52:10
I've never heard of that before but it sounds cool.  Do you remember what you did to enable it?  Does it work with all cards or only certain ones?
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:24:53
Well I feel like a dummy
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:42:25
Yeah, and it took me like 4 years to get even a +1% return on BTC

You're giving people faaaar too much credit. How many people even remember Kavanaugh or what Kim Jong Un was up to a mere couple of months ago?  And TV business news is terrible at putting things in context. Their whole thing is low cost content that is out there before anyone else. They're not going to say 'take a step back this time and just think about it' when the market starts pointing upward. They're gonna say 'is this the big one?' cause that gets eyeballs.

It's funny because apparently the nurse lost her mind more than the dude in the coma. Very "Twilight Zone"

It must be nice going through life unaware that America is not, in fact, the most of the world.

Nothing.  It means people do most of their banking on the website now.

...so this shithead lawyer calls long distance from Texas, and he says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He says, "sorry to inform you, but your brother just died."  He was an asshole. Run off years ago, family ain't heard of him since. Figured him for dead anyway.  So this lawyer prick says, "your brother died a rich man." Oil wells and shit, close to a million bucks. Jesus, it's frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get. 
So I get thirty-five thousand. That's what he left me. You think I'm lucky?  Dumbshit. What do you figure the government's gonna do to me? Take a big wet bite out of my ass, is what. Maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with. 
Then what happens? You pay tax on the car. Repairs and maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' you to take 'em for a ride, later, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! Then at the end of the year, if you figured the tax wrong, they make you pay out of your own pocket. Uncle Sam puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple. Always get the short end. That's a fact. 
*spits over the side of the building* 
Some brother. Shit.

That's an excellent metric, actually.

...And then his prescribed remedy for the dot-com bubble-burst economy was for the government and FED to deliberately encourage families to invest in homes and create a bubble in that sector.  I forgot how that one turned out, though.

People are way too reckless with their money in crypto. Everyone knows most of the coins are scams yet they exercise shockingly little prudence when they start sending money to someone they've never heard of before. They need to wake the fuck up and stop waiting for someone else to protect them from themselves.

It's a classic!
