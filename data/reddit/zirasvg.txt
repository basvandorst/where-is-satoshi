Isn't there a bit of a difference here though? The guy may be struggling and could use that money severely right now, rather than 5 years in the future where it *might* have tremendously increased, but could also have tremendously decreased.
Play the market for your own game. Some do it to get rich, some just need to fucking pay their bills off to better their life. Even the rich started somewhere.

It told me once I spend $500 my limit will increase, I spent $300 and a couple days later it shows "You need to spend $544 more to increase your limit".
Fuck coinbase.

Seriously, that would take *years* to accumulate studying for graduation. Like, if he worked a job at $20k a year while studying college (very doubtful, as it's hard to keep a full time job like that and college at the same time), it would still take more than 5 years of spending absolutely none of it towards anything but college. This is a life changer for that kid.

That's the bank limit, not the card limit which is instant funds.

Yeah, I was gonna invest a small portion of some of my BTC into Ripple, then saw that fee was going to eat it almost all up. RIP dreams.

Yeah, it's getting into the rich get richer category now. I invested some because it'd be nice to have some extra cash in the future if it does skyrocket, but I'm not going to hit anywhere near the profits those that bought in and held even a year ago will make simply because the current buy in is fucking huge. Shit, if I had bought a month ago when I told myself I would, I'd currently be able to at least be able to pay off my credit card and then some, but now I'm stuck with the initial investors sloppy thirds.
