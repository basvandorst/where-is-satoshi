Same. I wanted some alternatives for CoinBase and some other exchanges and OF COURSE Arizona isn't one of the supported states :(.

Yup. There was a thread I read before with a person who claimed to be a lawyer. To their knowledge as long as the Bitcoin is not transferred into fiat then you don't owe any tax on it, or something to that effect. They also had many other useful information regarding Bitcoins and taxes. Like what counts as long-term or short-term capital gains and what you would owe. Etc. So basically as long as you use Bitcoin as the main form of payment (possibly with fiat as the reference for pricing but not actually converting the Bitcoin to fiat) you shouldn't owe any taxes. Of course there may be legal loopholes that apply but that isn't very likely.

Sorry deleted my last comment.
Do you mean 18.8.2015? That would be Aug 18, 2015 which is the last transaction.
@_date: 2015-12-03 03:10:32
Yeah I tend to get paranoid as well. I've been hacked once in the past in 8th grade. Although nothing was stolen (wasn't into BTC at the time or had any important accounts/documents/etc.). The guy took over my PC and deleted everything I had (I had a backup from a week prior on an external HDD so I wasn't *too* worried). I didn't have any antivirus, adblock, or popup blockers of any kind at the time even though I was pretty into tech. I've since wised up and made sure to do my research before getting infected (I use Defender as a main defense, Malwarebytes as a secondary scan, and then Roguekiller/Hitman Pro/etc. just to be sure. Firefox is equipped with Ublock Origin, Pop-up blocker, and KeeFox for use with KeePass). I always make sure when downloading a torrent that the comments don't say it's infected and from a trusted release group and a trusted user on the torrent site. Same reason why I went Private tracker for FO4 (also because download speeds were waaaay better).
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:04:09
Wouldn't it also count as a taxable event when cashing out from Coinbase to your bank? I'd guess it's similar when using the card since it converts to fiat at the most recent conversion rate. It's easy to check in your Coinbase account I'd assume since it shows how much Bitcoin you spent and shows its value in fiat at the rate you used it at.
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:01:19
I don't think it would be too messy as long as you know what you're doing. If you are going to be using Bitcoin and converting to fiat you better be prepared to claim those earnings to the IRS as it is. So things like keeping track of when you bought said Bitcoin, when you converted to fiat, what prices you bought and sold at, etc. Of course since the Shift card doesn't mention taxes and such on their website this could be a problem for the average person who doesn't really think about these things. Good thing that Coinbase at least shows your BTC amount you used along with the amount converted to fiat at the conversion rate at the time it was used. I guess as long as you keep track of your Bitcoin (how much would be considered long-term capital gains and how much would be considered short-term) on a spreadsheet or something, you won't have any problems. This of course comes with the disadvantage of making your Bitcoin spending much more time consuming and less user friendly.
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:10:42
You should make sure you have 2FA enabled so even if you ended up giving your info you would still need to use your phone and a code to log in. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 07:35:44
That's how I started. I became interested with Bitcoin, didn't know too much, got a Coinbase account and connected my Bank, and then withdrew my bitcoin (I got some from places like faucets or whatever at first). Now I use it as my main wallet when transacting with friends or online merchants etc. I did my research for offline/hardware wallets and now I know that if I want to hold onto my BTC for the long term I can move it there where I have control over my Private keys and offline so no one can take them. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 07:39:11
The only good use for the Shift card is a way for someone to get the BTC outside of their wallet in places that don't already support Bitcoin. Like he said it isn't for everyone but it certainly helps those who want their Bitcoin out without having to go through a long withdrawal process or having to connect to their bank before purchasing something. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:07:39
Checkout LibertyX. They have a map with nearby stores that support them. You have to pay cash so you can just withdraw from an ATM (possibly in the same store) and then use it to buy Bitcoin. You have to buy $50, $100, $200, or $300 at a time though. And there's a daily limit of 4 transactions, and either a daily limit of $500 unverified or $1000 verified (using photo ID etc.).
@_date: 2015-12-13 08:56:37
And if you feel "unsafe" using an online wallet, get something like a hardware wallet on your phone, or a computer that uses something like a Linux distro and doesn't go online all the time, or more preferably a paper wallet (just don't forget your private keys).
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:38:20
I agree with some of what you said. Taxes in the US are, for the most part, a joke and the IRS is very strict and avoiding them can be very risky with huge potential consequences for even people unaware about it. I never turn my Bitcoin directly into fiat. Of course I do turn it into gift cards using websites or trading or use it as the main currency. Withdrawing to my bank has tax implications and using a debit card could follow the same (unless it's one of those anonymous cards that don't require name, address, and SSN).
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:28:15
Actually a good one could also be Bluebird (I use it myself connected to my Coinbase account). They have no overdraft fees or anything so you can't spend more than you have and you can move money from a regular bank to your Bluebird account. Very useful. You can sign up online for free and wait for the debit card to arrive or go to a Walmart and buy a temporary card for like $5 I think.
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:47:33
To be safe scan with the following:
[Malwarebytes Anti Malware](
[Hitman Pro](
Also never save passwords in your browser. Disable your browser's ability to save passwords and use something like KeePass instead. I use it in conjunction with KeeFox (a KeePass add-on for Firefox) to allow me to save passwords and usernames automatically and to auto type them as well.
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:48:35
Were they able to be found by things like RogueKiller, Hitman Pro, or Malwarebytes? Or even some other more obscure but better antimalware?
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:39:51
It would be theft when they move the coins because as he said they cannot be copied and are also considered a currency so of course it will count as theft. When Object A is moved from Place A to Place B without knowledge of the user that is theft.
A password is only what allows access to the wallet. Anyone could have my password but if they don't use it and steal my coins no theft has happened (or at least nothing that can be traced back to the attacker and thus no evidence).
@_date: 2015-12-03 06:50:40
To put it into perspective:
Bitcoin, which is digital and not physical, can still be stolen. If it the BTC goes from Place A to Place B without the user's knowledge and Place A no longer has the BTC it is stealing. So if someone hacked my account and sent my 1BTC to their account and now I have 0BTC that is stealing.
Pirating in this sense is different. You cannot "remove" the object from a place to another. Essentially you are making an exact replica and using it. Now to compare it to the above it would be like if you had 1BTC in your account and someone copied it to theirs to where you still have 1BTC and now they also have 1BTC. Nothing was removed in the process. Now what matters here is whether or not that counts as actually stealing or just against the law because you went around the policies put in place (while still not actually being stealing).
@_date: 2015-12-04 07:40:56
It's not really useless the way I see it. Sure for the whole of the Bitcoin Network it has no real impact but for an individual it is very useful. It provides an easy way for someone to convert their BTC to USD or whatever and purchase what they need without having to go through the whole process of selling, waiting a day or so, and then receiving the money in their bank account. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:30:19
You should use Bluebird as your bank connected to your Coinbase account. No overdraft fees since you can't pay more than you have. You can then connect a regular Bank/Debit Card/Credit Card to your Bluebird account and add money. Free to sign up online and wait for the debit card (takes like a week) or go to Walmart and buy a temporary card for like $5 and use it. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:42:26
On all 3? Then in that case I would rule out torrents and viruses as the cause of this issue. Did you by any chance log into your wallet in or around the 11th? ~~It could also be an issue with logging into a phishing site without knowing.~~ What other activities have you done on your computer related to your BTC account after your last transaction (whether it be viewing or looking at the price within your wallet etc.). What other files have you downloaded/installed since then? Any programs related to Bitcoin that you have installed besides Multibit?
@_date: 2015-12-05 19:55:16
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:26:59
Then why don't you use your bank account that's connected on Coinbase? Unless of course you're trying to avoid the wait time.
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:38:59
Any other programs that you've installed around August-November. Doesn't have to be BTC related. Any other games? GTA V with mods perhaps? Trying to get as much as I can so we can figure out if it truly was malware since this was a desktop wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:46:45
General rule of thumb is to only use online wallets like Coinbase if you're buying and selling using your bank account and you want to spend the BTC relatively soon. Other more secure wallets are better for holding coins and keeping them safe from potential risks that online wallets have. Best bet is when wanting to keep the BTC from Coinbase, just send them to another address (paper wallet, hardware wallet, etc.) and keep them there. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:23:51
Ah I see what you mean. You could use Coinbase but it requires a Bank Account to be connected (which is easy to set up on there). You can also connect a Credit Card to allow instant buys since usually it takes 4-7 days when buying Bitcoin before it's in your account (which can be bad when the price changes mid transaction). 
@_date: 2015-12-02 19:43:32
Sorry messed up. Edited comment. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:32:25
You could try Circle if they support your bank/debit card. They have a limit of $100 instant buys and the rest afterwards comes days later.
Also check out 
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:00:20
The reason it takes so long for buying (selling usually takes like a day for me or less) from what I've read, is because it's the same wait time it takes for your money from your bank to transfer to theirs. They have the option to enable Instant buying but you have to add a credit card.
@_date: 2015-12-02 19:42:50
Okay thanks. I'll do some scans. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 09:59:21
I got mine from a Private tracker. Am I safe?
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:00:53
Yeah. Too bad I don't have one lol. So I have to wait the few days for my coin while the price changes :( .
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:37:55
True. But since they are malware I would think any smart antimalware out there would at least flag the offending file. I didn't even have any false positives with the CODEX release I torrented. But of course someone *could* be smart enough to obfuscate it enough as to hide it from any sort of protection but I doubt that. Especially considering OP's case I'm not sure if it would be the torrent. It could be coincidental in the timing and he was probably infected from something else or not infected but hacked (unlikely though). Idk. It just baffles me. I would think there would be tons more cases if it was due to the torrent. I also make sure to protect myself by not using any inbuilt password managers in my browser but instead use KeePass to store all my usernames and passwords and 2 factor authentication on anything important (banking, gmail, coinbase, etc.).
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:48:57
Damn that sucks. Well it happens sometimes. Good luck!
@_date: 2015-12-11 23:16:34
Ah okay cool. I do it because I'm too lazy to go make an account at Wells Fargo or a local bank lol. Much faster and easier to use for me at the moment. But I think it's incompatible with PayPal which sucks. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 21:33:59
Okay so nothing has come up in my scans. I would think by now most antivirus/antimalware would have newer infections in their database. I've used Windows Defender, Malwarebytes, and Roguekiller so far. I've also had no indication of there being any malware anyway. No stolen bitcoin (I've used it quite a bit the past few weeks), no stolen PayPal, and no stolen passwords or anything.
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:51:24
Another good thing to try is boot into safe mode and scan it all again. Or use a Linux LiveCD and then use a malware scanner and scan your hard drive.
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:19:45
Share that money man! Haha.
Anyway the real thing to do is try to get that money on a very secure cold storage wallet. Preferably a hardware wallet. Desktop wallets on a Linux distro or on a computer that is mainly offline is a good choice. If you have any Android phone you could get Mycelium (preferably with Ledger integrated if you can) or something like Samourai wallet. Now as for withdrawing that becomes really tough. You could sign up for a debit card or something that supports bitcoin (look around for what the best one is and anonymous as well. Look around here on Reddit or make a new topic asking). You could also use something like  and buy gift cards for yourself on it ($500 max per gift card. You can buy multiple). Supports many popular services and stores like Amazon, Best Buy, etc.
@_date: 2015-12-02 10:07:29
Any explanation as to why? I would think private trackers are safer.
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:54:22

@_date: 2016-02-07 22:46:04
Some people said a good way is to just send the coins to another wallet and then to another and then to another. Then use that final wallet for whatever you want. As for mixing I think it's recommended if you want to make sure they are anonymized but it isn't required. A good method (and easy too) would be to use something like ShapeShift, I'm not exactly sure if Coinbase really does track through multiple hops though. That seems kinda strange. Because as long as the coins are moved out of their service into your own wallet they have no use to know what you do with it. I think it only really matters if you directly use the Coinbase wallet for gambling and such.
@_date: 2016-02-07 23:33:44
Ah I see. Well then. Well I guess then it would be better to get your coins in other ways if you are going to be doing illegal or highly suspect things with them (not aimed at you specifically if that's what you thought. Aimed at anyone who use Coinbase and such). Using things like localbitcoins (with a personal wallet) or use mixing services and such (but just be careful obviously). Although I'm unsure of the credibility of the whole situation in the first result (not that I don't believe it but there could be a couple facts missing. Seems to happen sometimes when people blame a company for banning them. Same can be said for the person who was banned after they exploited a bug to try and get more BTC or something like that.). And the second result I think the issue is some kind of legal issues with the volume of Bitcoin people are buying/selling/receiving/sending etc. which can trip their alarms or whatever and initiate an investigation (which doesn't always come up with the best results). It just seems in some of these problems the people are being rather vague and aren't really proving their point of view to the Coinbase team (as best they can at least). Not trying to defend their service or whatnot but just trying to give some possible scenarios. The real issue really boils down to the laws they have to follow and the steps they have to take to follow them. A business tries it's best to stay legitimate by following their laws to the letter so as to not cause any issues but in doing so they also tend to mess things up due to the way the laws work. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 17:05:50
Yeah I don't get why people complain about these things. Don't use Coinbase as a wallet. It's a Bitcoin *service* and as such they have precautions and rules to keep them in business. If you really want somewhere to keep your coins and freely use it for whatever purpose, just use a private wallet.
@_date: 2016-02-08 00:09:18
Woah hold on there. Why the sudden hostility?
My comment was meant to be informative for some other readers and such and maybe some possible scenarios for the results you sent me. That's all. I was keeping my comment relevant to my original comment while commenting on your reply and adding some other information explaining my thought process and such. I'll be honest and say that I may have been a tad too explanatory in my last comment which tends to go off into tangents which may or may not be relevant. And it may not have made any sense and for that I apologize.
@_date: 2016-02-07 17:08:21
Well with locking your account I've heard you can still take out your bitcoin (otherwise it would be illegal or something) however you can no longer use their services afterward. But that only happens when you go against their terms of service like gambling, money laundering, and other questionable activities.  But besides that Coinbase should be treated similarly to an exchange. Buy and then get your bitcoin out into a personal wallet.
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:57:03

**EDIT: Just finished!**
@_date: 2016-05-15 01:31:19
I guess my wording was indeed exaggerated. But you get my point. The protections in place work faster and better on credit cards than debit cards in most cases because it involves money you aren't liable for. When it's your debit card you have the risk of having your account frozen until they fix the issue (can take days, weeks, months, etc.). This means you can end up late on bills, payments, without funds etc. With a credit card you owe nothing, you still have access to your money, and you get a new card. Like in general they are both "safe" but debit cards hold more risks involved when it comes to accessing your money right after the fact.
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:30:08
Awesome! I'll look into that. How do they compare to Mycelium?
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:50:43

@_date: 2016-05-14 20:06:52
Credit cards are great actually. Especially if you want to build credit to buy a house and car and such. You just have to use it wisely. Use only what you can pay back once the bill comes in. Also credit cards have WAAAAAY better protections in place vs debit cards. Debit cards (if stolen/copied etc.) will use the money straight away from YOUR account. This can be a hassle to get back. Credit Cards use BORROWED money so you'll have zero liability towards fraud/theft and can still use the card without issue (the bank will get their money back and won't hold you responsible). Also they have extensive capabilities over debit cards in general (just look at their features). Lots of people have had skimmers or overdrafts done on debit cards by rogue payments at places like gas stations. Either use a credit card or cash in places like that.
I'm going to be receiving my Capital One Secured Credit Card soon ($99 refundable deposit for a $200 credit line) and will be using it to build my credit. I won't be spending more than my means and will always pay in full when the bill comes in. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 17:25:07
Ah okay. So to be careful for locks don't send to random bitcoin addresses unless it's another one of my own wallets or I know it's a coinbase wallet (or at least not from localbitcoin correct?).
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:50:06
Bitcoins **are** money, it's just up to whoever they are paying whether or not they accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:51:43
True but that would defeat the purpose of having the wallet anyway! Lol. Plus I don't have a lot of friend's with iPhones, mostly Android. I do however have an iPod Touch 4th Gen, maybe that could work? Although I'm assuming the wallet might require a more recent version of iOS.
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:11:39
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:03:43
When I saw how cool it was as a currency. It was useful especially since you don't need a card or bank account to pay for things on sites that support it. Also after I heard about the $1000 spike (that I sadly missed since I didn't know much about Bitcoin before last year) I became interested in something that I can hold and receive a higher value than I invested (without having to using stocks or the like).
@_date: 2015-11-08 07:05:54
Yup! Installed just fine. Don't know if it's actually doing anything but I suppose it's doing it's job in the background.
@_date: 2015-11-07 17:23:14
True. I guess I meant a paradox in his wording. Since you can't reach a certain point without going through another but he requires you to have the second point before the first (making it effectively impossible).
@_date: 2015-11-10 07:56:17
Alright will do. So I should use it for cold storage? 
@_date: 2015-11-07 18:46:08
Oh I just made a Mycelium wallet the other day! And I own a Galaxy Note 5! What does the TEE plugin do?

What advantages does Bitcoin Core have over others? Is it user friendly or does it require some knowledge before use?
As for offline that makes a lot of sense for storing large amounts don't know why I didn't think of that lol. What's the best paper wallet out there?
@_date: 2016-05-15 00:16:12
Yeah here in the US fraud is a huge thing. Especially when using cards outside of the US (skimmers, RFID readers, etc.). It's best to be safe and use a credit card and just pay the bill with your checking account when the bill comes. Extra protection and zero fraud liability to the user (whereas debit transactions can be a bit more problematic). Any amount stolen from a credit card won't affect your checking account and only affects the bank involved (which they will try their hardest to get the money back). Debit affects you directly (money in, money out) and banks for have precautions for that but they will have to freeze your account for an indefinite amount of time and you will be without money for a while.
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:38:58
Wait how do I get Samourai Wallet? Their site says to request Alpha Access and the only one in the Play Store is Sentinel.

@_date: 2015-11-07 08:53:43
Thanks. What advantages does Circle have over Coinbase if I may ask? The main use I have for Coinbase is to buy/hold/sell. So far I heard Circle has really low limits so it makes it harder for buying/selling. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 09:09:50
Just made a Circle account and I have a limit of $300 on buying or selling over 7 days. I requested a limit increase so we'll see how that goes. Also I can't add any of my debit cards or my bank (which isn't listed on their site and I tried to add manually with correct information) which sucks. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:28:52
Okay cool. I'll keep it in mind!
@_date: 2016-05-14 21:23:38
The credit card is just for building and maintaining good credit. Doesn't mean you have to use one. You could always finance or something like that. But yeah I guess laws in some countries do differ when it comes to that. My point was that without any prior credit/bad credit getting a loan for a house or car will be extremely difficult (at least here in the US). Especially if you want to get a good mortgage and such. The secured credit card is meant for those types of people (like myself since I have no credit) to build credit.
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:29:02
As mentioned in my post I only use Android so no iOS here! Thanks for the info though!
@_date: 2015-11-09 04:08:02

@_date: 2016-05-14 20:04:01
There are some debit cards (technically reloadable cards) that you can get at convenience stores. Some don't require the user to be 18 and they usually have no fees (besides ATM transactions) and no overdrafting. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 03:38:29
