But bro... one time I put money in and got more money out...
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:52:35
Put in a hundred last night right after I posted :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:35:37
Wow... I felt like punching myself in the dick for losing $1,800 in the last 5 days. I wish you well in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:35:17
They should have some money. I have been paying a shit ton in fees.

I don’t think his little dinky country will extradite him or convict him. Isn’t he the richest person on that island?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:00:11
Bitches be crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:37:50
Fuck the Wall Street Journal
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:23:13
It’s fake. It’s a new account. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:51:34
What are those? I see they are USB miners. But what are they all about?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:39:04
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:06:44
Im the opposite
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:11:17
I work next to the Coliseum should I go ask them to do that?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:04:25
No reason to not trickle money in. There is almost no amount too small unless the fee out weighs the buy in.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:25:20
He knows that he doesn’t understand fully. Help him out and don’t be a fuck along the way.
He’s saying it’s hard for new people to understand.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:31:39
I want that coin.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:50:28
It was just wishful thinking I’m sure but they shot their own idea down knowing people would buy the one true coin.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:36:58
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:47:28
Yeah this seems shitty
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:31:16
Sorry the Coliseum is Overstocks building. Real perty building
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:35:26
Few things could deter me from BTC now that I’ve jumped in. Big Bang Theory is one of them.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:03:09
That’s awesome! Thanks you! All I want is a realice risk free way to be intro into cryptos and mining and I️ think you just answered my question. Not expecting to get rich just have some fun.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:46:45
That wasn’t FUD. If anything he is trying to decrease FUD.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:32:22
Any good recommendations for a wallet? Very new to this
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:51:19
I appreciate the advice. I’m not selling anytime soon. I’m not stressing about the drop. Once I cash my check this weekend I am going to get more. I️ want Cryptos to have Cryptos. 
Thank you again!
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:35:11
Mind saying why?
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:09:17
How dare I? Forgive please
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:06:52
I’m new to this but Blockfolio has been ok
You can also put your holdings in
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:58:57
Nah. I hate it. It makes me want to double down to bunker down and hold.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:58:51
Go away.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:16:56
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:57:38
bcash for me from here on put
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:48:17
I couldn’t be happier that I just so happened to transfer the small btc I have out of that.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:42:56
Ok. Thanks for the quick response!
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:35:21
Jesus... that was explosive. Not at all the Bitcoin Yoda. 
Wouldn’t the Cash app allow me to pay my friends in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:20:22
I literally just do a few Amazon surveys each day and at the end of the week put that in. It’s not much but I don’t have to take money out of my check and it grows steadily.
Have fun!
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:56:07
iOS is a bitch right?
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:43:49
Jeez I didn’t realize it could be so long. Thanks for the response!
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:51:55
Ohhhhhhh that sounds like a good tool! Im going to check that out. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:03:45
I hear ya
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:43:05
If you were Bitcoin Yoda you would have said ‘Bitcoin Yoda I am...’
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:18:38
Just margin trade it and get liquidated earlier so the rest of us don’t have to suffer :)
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:49:11
Are their any downsides to Bisq?
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:40:01
You guess and then wonder how you could have been wrong.
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:11:47
Thank you! App downloaded.
@_date: 2018-12-22 19:42:15
I’ve never heard it explained so succinctly. Beautiful.
