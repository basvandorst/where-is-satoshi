How to Explain Bitcoin to Your Parents.
- The internet in the late 80's = Blockchain today
- Email in the early 90's = Bitcoin today
- Microsoft and Apple in the late 80's (and other companies that never made it) = Ethereum today (and other tokenized platforms)
 
The internet made it possible/easier to connect people across the world. Blockchain makes it possible/easier to send things of value across the world.
Email used the internet to make it easy to send messages to each other across the world almost instantly. Bitcoin uses blockchain to make it easier to transfer currency across the world almost instantly.
Microsoft and Apple made it easier to use the internet by making it more user friendly.  Ethereum makes it easier to use the blockchain by making it more user friendly.

Everything, including this possible hack, is so questionable and unknown. It is very hard to understand how BitConnect works, who controls it, what happened in this "hack" etc.  So many uncertainties that they cannot answer.  Confusion is a way Ponzi schemes keep the people from calling them out by making the user so confused.  Not to mention its difficult to make a scam sound legitimate.  Nothing looks legitimate with BitConnect and yet people still are going into it.

Trust is the biggest problem that I have when I try to explain it.  They just don't trust the system...yet :)
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:35:19
...blockchain has an immense number of uses.  It just hasn't grown yet.  But with the likes of Ethereum people can use the blockchain a lot easier for other things, like smart contracts. which would be a massive use case for blockchain outside of currency. And that is just one of many possibilities.

thanks.  are we support to report to CRA?

say you found 20 BTC in a old wallet.  Sell it, use it as a down payment for a nice house and start a tuition fund for your kids.  HODL the rest quietly.

of course.  if all i had was btc i'd use btc too.  but if i had both, which 99.99% people will always have, then i will use fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:18:19
yes. I very much agree.  but as long as fiat will be worth less and bitcoin will be worth more or the same in the future AND we have both BTC and fiat, it will always benefit the person to spend fiat over btc. Making the number of transactions minimal and thus much harder to catch on as a currency.  
If you have both BTC  AND fiat, you will only ever use BTC if you think it will go down in value faster than fiat.  as when it is inflation proof, that makes it unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:44:24
People will always buy things that go down in value, but that is because they consider it worth the loss in value. Like a phone, or a car.  But BTC will not be going down in value (long term).  It will be going up, and going up faster than most things.  So why spend BTC when it makes more sense to spend things that will be worth less in the future (fiat money) 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:09:01
you wouldn't.  But the money that is inherently less valuable is not going away.  As long as there is fiat money, it will be a competitor to bitcoin as a currency. and will make more sense to spend that (if you have it).  Any people will always have fiat money...or at least always in our life time.

yeah, as the guy above has noted, it was dogshit lol
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:54:49
can't argue with that.  But why would you spend BTC on it when USD makes wake more sense.  since it will be worth less in the future compared to BTC.  Since you would benefit from using USD over btc, you would use USD.  So BTC would not be used in many transactions
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:47:11
governmetn could tax bitcoin gains when you liquidate into fiat. so may make sense to always hold fiat and not convert totally into bitcoin.  and definitely doesnt make sense to convert all into bitcoin until you can use it everywhere.
