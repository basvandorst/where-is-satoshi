I agree my anger has gotten the better of me. But this is extremely stressful especially considering this happened right at the end of the month. I have bills to pay, but no money to pay them with.

Why would a currency conversion cost a couple grand?

The answer is call your bank and freeze your account. If they havent already, circle may try to 
A) Move large amounts of money through your bank account
B) Steal money from YOU!
C) OR if you are particularly unlucky both A + B happen to you!!!
Ontop of all this, once they've stolen from you, dont expect to be able to contact them.
What ever you do, beware of circle!

Well I really am naive when it comes to bit coin to be honest. But all I can say is they emptied out my bank account. And now I have no money. 
Whether or not you believe isn't really up to me. I am quite frustrated, but I just felt I should say something about what happened.

Transfers have never taken time for me in the past. And they removed more money from my bank account until it was empty. I'm pretty sure they are not supposed to do that.

No no. Look I have a bank account with my debit card and what not. When I made my circle account I put funds into to it using my debit card. Then tried to move some of those funds back. Instead of getting my money back into my debit card account my debit card was charged again and again repeatedly until it was empty. I've been saying this all along.

No. It was usd. I am not British. There was no currency conversion other than the usd to Bitcoin conversion.

No there were multiple transactions after the initial transaction. So after I moved money to circle, then I tried to move money out of circle and instead of getting that money back my account was flooded with transactions mostly removing money from my account. And leaving it empty.

It wasnt a bank transfer. It was my debit card. And I dont have any money in my bank because of circle now. So "well established" is a load of shit. They fucked me over.
meager or not, it doesnt matter. The point being they stole money from me. And now my bank account is empty.
