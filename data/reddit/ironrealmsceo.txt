If you define 'people' and 'market demand' as the tiny group of people who use bitcoin to transact currently and use escrow services, sure.
People generally are never going to give up chargeback protection for a patently inferior alternative like escrow (which certainly has its place, but replacing chargeback protection isn't that place).

Yep, that's reasonable. That could easily be offered with credit cards as well though. Merchants don't do it because they know people forget about their subscriptions.

Well, I can certainly understand not wanting a third party to run your card at any time, but is that a concern particularly rooted in reality?
For instance, in my business, we use Stripe (a major payment processor) for credit card and bitcoin payment. Let's say you go to one of our sites and buy something from us with a credit card. In no way does that give us the ability to initiate another charge with your card. We don't even have access to your card number - only the last four digits. 
Beyond that, any merchant that made any sort of practice of initiating charges for no reason would quickly be banned from the credit card networks. It almost happened to my business about 18 years ago when our credit card processor (not Stripe, didn't exist then) screwed up and submitted 4-8 charges for every real charge for a couple of days. We were able to prove it wasn't our fault or our intention, but it was a close thing. They take that shit -really- seriously, because the whole value of Visa/Mastercard other than the payment network itself is the brand that consumers both recognize and trust. 
And of course, if it ever did happen, you can easily file a chargeback.
In short, I get why you feel that way, but think it's such a minor risk that having chargeback protection as a consumer vastly outweighs it.

That's a negative, not a positive, for a buyer. It's only a positive for a seller.

Well, my point was it's still a negative. An escrow service doesn't solve the same problem that a 6 month chargeback window does.

Or I can just use a credit card, which protects me for 6 months after my purchase, vs an escrow service that ceases offering me protecting the minute they release funds to the seller.
(I say this, btw, as someone whose business takes bitcoin.)

It's really not. It's a highly-diversified international conglomerate.

No, that's not what credit cards do. Credit cards actually release the money to the merchant a couple days after the charge is made. No merchant is going to use a service that means they can't access their money for 6 months. That's a total non-starter.
