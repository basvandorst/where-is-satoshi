yes, i received 2 usb cable with my device so i tried both but same results.
I  checked "devices and printers " in my laptop and saw the trezor, clicked on it and it said this device is working properly, it also said there is no driver for this device.
I tried firefox,IE and google chrome browser and none is recognizing my device when on mytrezor.com, the chrome extension doesnt recognize it either.
However when i plug device in boot mode, i can see the firmware update page so i did update it, and it was asking my device to confirm the things displayed on my screen so my laptopt definetely communicate with my device in some way but i cant get the mytrezor.com page to recognize my device.
Please advise if you can
Thank you

when i try to download it says error opening file for writting.
Even with the chrome extension app it still says connect your trezor to start although i have connected it

i think mytrezor wallet is required to first initialized the device. I can create a wallet directly with electrum on my trezor can i ?

yes i did that and it solved the download error, so now i have downloaded the correct bridge version  but the mytrezor.com still doesnt recognize my device.

My windows OS detected the trezor driver correctly only in bootloader mode but not in normal mode.
Ive been advised to try a linux OS on the same laptop and it worked.
Trezor support said they will get back to me when they have a fix for this issue.
