Dude it is super early, but and hold now you will regret it later!
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:18:19
Lol I don’t think they know what they are getting themselves into...this isn’t something they can check everyday at 4:30 pm when the traditional markets close and be at peace of mind. Also, the volatility is greater than any stock. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:05:54
You really shouldn’t risk that much money! Where are you making that kind of coin at your age?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:03:10
I do both
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:11:35
Satoshi Dice google it
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:40:13
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:42:04
Alts are tough and I would fuck with that shit until you know what you are doing. The worse thing about alts is rebounding can be a bitch. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:37:16
Yeah and just poor taste. If I want to donate to a good cause I’ll donate to a charity that takes bitcoin. Not some dude on the Internet who can easily make shit up. Start a GoFundMe
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:12:48
It will be back but yeah scalability will have to occur and it will.  Still super early in the adoption phase.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:30:55
Is this similar to mining? But chances of you actually getting a coin is very slim?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:43:25
Please post the contract afterwords
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:22:00
Can you add alerts for price changes?
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:15:14
Much better approach then the PayPal scammers who screw over eBay businesses!
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:57:35
I hate taxes but don’t give the government more fuel to regulate/ban crypto. You only pay taxes if you profit. Pay your damn taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:38:11
Does it matter for capital gains?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:56:35
Sweet man no worries going to hold and buy at the dip!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:24:28
Do you need to get super detailed and track dates and transactions? Can’t you just subtract initial investment from realized profit? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:57:04
This...when I see people buying BTC on credit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:50:03
If everyone bought at that time price would sky rocket. The best time to buy is when  it dips and the price has stabilized and not a lot of volatility. At the same this doesn’t always happen and it just dips and shoots back up right away.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:25:42
Lmao no not yet it’s a very small percentage of the population still,
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:32:21
Lmao all bullshit
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:06:13
Doesn’t the private key for btc become useless in regards to quantum computers being able to crack the private keys instantly? Or would they just update the code?
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:47:24
Personally no one can tell...what I look for is a dip followed by stability for a period of time. However, people just wait for these dips and buy as soon as it happens so you miss out with the above method...but it’s a little more cautious strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:23:55
Do you pay capital gains on fees as well or just profits after subtracting fees? Not selling but curious.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:07:42
It’s the true currency of the world because we live in a simulation anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:10:54
Need to put you in a coma.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:27:42
I mean you shouldn’t be investing in something if you don’t have the actual money. I’m a believer in bitcoin but I’m not going to take a high interest loan out to invest in it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:33:30
But they aren’t actually buying btc when they buy a future. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:18:46
Should be able to make that back switching to Geico bro
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:21:30
Anytime I sold at a loss I regretted it because the price bounced back.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:50
My GDAX has been fucked for a good 10 minutes and not the good kind of fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:54:49
Nobody knows but I buy the dips...too much growth occurring right now
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:40:18
Thank you sir! I will put your money to good use on the most expensive wine and hookers I can find.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:12:58
I really hope they do so I can buy cheap bitcoins as well!
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:02:25
You will have many regrets selling doesn’t have to be one of them. Hold during panics and buy during dips has worked great for me so far.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:08:36
It’s not really slow...it hovered around 3k and 5k for awhile then took off. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:16:57
I respect him, but is he willing to eat his manhood on live TV to back up his prediction. What reasons did he give for this belief?
Without a source I call bullshit on this one.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:34:45
Lmao. Thank you for making me laugh out this shit while I read this shit post.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:10:56
I think whales would have to actually buy BTC and have a position to manipulate the price for shorts. Futures themselves don’t purchase btc.
I think the interesting part is this isn’t the stock market. Exchanges don’t stop trading, new coins are created daily, very limited supply. It’s going to be a different game then they are use to playing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:27:53
It takes time for people to adopt technology just because it started a decade ago has nothing to do with the user base. The user base and adoption have grown. How much of the population was in crypto two or three years ago compared to now? It’s still super early on a user base standpoint.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:49:25
And what kind of hoe pairs well with that wine?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:20:16
You shouldn’t be here man. You obv do not make good financial decisions and this is not the investment you should be making. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:32:09
Holding bitch
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:05:05
I just saw someone posted the math on this the other day. I believe it was about 4 million coins lost if you count Satoshi’s wallets and lost coins/wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:27:55
BTC for most of its history has been underground solo investors. Now that it has gone mainstream more whales and large investors could pump and dump. 
I’ll be buying the dips so I’m not worried. We had btc hit 19k and crash back down to 16k. It happens
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:53:34
Thanks for helping me keep a pinky!
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:00:19
Fucking great!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:32:21
Thanks appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:32:42
Good to know thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:45:51
Gotcha man makes sense just saw you mentioned it ruined your retirement and was concerned. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:48:56
Ruining my day lol. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:34:53
Reputation is big and if they are screwing customers it will catch up. If the store is online then yeah reviews work best.  I mean bad yelp reviews can crush restaurants in Los Angeles. There is no 100% answer though even the way it works with third party the bank is screwing honest sellers who are being scammed. Best bet is to try your hardest to do business and buy from people you know treat their customers right and have a good reputation.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:08:01
Keep farting asshole!
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:26:12
Do you have any proof that these big companies have big positions in btc right now? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:25:32
Right it works both ways and what eventually would happen is people would lose trust with the Merchant if they screw people over. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:58:01
Same not selling and don’t give a fuck about futures or crazy price drops. Buying those dips.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:46:56
Only 1% of the population has adopted crypto so far, so value wise tons of room for growth.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:48:42
Someone who gets it!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:10:10
I’ve seen btc relatively  stable for a week in the past. It’s been crazy for almost an entire month. I welcome this calm.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:30:05
Is he willing to eat his manhood on that prediction? If not I’m going to have to stick with Mcafee’s prediction of where BTC will be by then ;)
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:48:27
I agree 13k is what my gut is telling me and everyone has been praying for this dip, so can’t wait to buy more btc myself. A lot of new coinbase users who prob are just now getting money into exchanges.
If it goes below 10k I’ll cut my pinky finger off and eat it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:53:52
Yep stay away mate
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:59:14
Yeah they’ve been saying a lot of things. We’re in a bubble but yet adoption is still low compared to the population but is growing.  You need to convince yourself why you believe in the coin not rely on others. 
The amount of growth available and kick ass tech is my reason for supporting crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:41:23
What kind of fee do they charge?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:42:28
Fees Incase you didn’t get it
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:26:02
People making money 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:43:41
Can you buy BTC if you own a future in it? I don’t think you can.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:26:08
If this is how you think...you shouldn’t be here mate.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:17:25
Yeah put this on gofundme doesn’t belong here. Hope it works out though.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:52:08
No just show them how to do it and set one up for them. Managing money for friends and family is not a spot you want to be in.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:45:18
Holding btc has been what works best for me. Panic selling is the worse but I think a lesson we’ve all learned.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:00:31
This would help the network though with congested transactions right?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:10:04
Sounds solid welcome to the game
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:53:06
I can’t stress it enough I lost to much money not following this Buy and hold. these crazy dips happen all the time and can last weeks. This is advice I wish I had taken sooner instead of selling when I started losing money. That being said don’t risk what you can’t afford to lose. It also sounds like you need to stop watching the price and letting emotions beat you my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:51:40
I’m all for this but it’s still early to be doing this until scaling is fixed which is coming.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:07:16
Bro I’m gonna make her say your name!
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:52:13
“Yep you can. Even if they can't, banks have offshore accounts.”
You just discredited yourself mate....and as much as I agree banks do shady shit. I just don’t think they’d take the risk on this one.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:35:48
No begging here. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:20:44
Upgrades will fix this...the beauty of tech
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:09:17
Won’t have any affect on me personally. I’ll just buy the dip and hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:49:51
Best idea I’ve heard of!
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:46
Idiot 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:55:11
Price dips are pretty common did you not see all the posts talking about this?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:03:19
16k on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:12:05
How did you hear about bitcoin and what made you want to buy? Even with the heavy amount of new users in the crypto space we have barely touched the potential user base of the population adopting it. I see large growth opportunity personally which is why I hold.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:26:21
I think you have your answer then. Panic selling happens a lot it’s exciting to buy the dips and accrue more coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:12:36
Solid questions and curious myself.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:35:32
Hold is something I wish I had learned sooner in the crypto world.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:41:45
All eyes are on Bitcoin and will be as it pioneers crypto to mass adoption. I’m not concerned with alts because there is more than enough user base left that can adopt crypto. I think less than 1% of the population is in crypto right not even with all the hype. Even 2% would be crazy right now. 
Once mass adoption occurs like 33-55% of the population then yeah it’s going to be a game of thrones style war for the throne.
Bitcoin is king for now and it’s going to sit on that throne for years to come if you like it or not. All the new folks who got into crypto most of them bought into btc not alts. This trend will continue until mass adoption. Then competition will matter more.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:16:34
You would see a massive dip fueled by fear and then a bunch of people would buy the dip to bring the price up. This is what happened when China banned BTC and they have a massive economy...
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:39:36
13k is the floor!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:26:26
The lightning network should be up and running by 2140 so people will spend it and free up reserves. The real issue is lost coins due to death, lost hard drives, etc. 
Those lost coins may need to expire or replaced after 100 years or whatever. Either way a solution will be created.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:02:36
25-30k end 2017 
100k+ end 2018  
Whales Investing - Large firms and Wallstreet will start buying positions (not talking futures Bc they don’t actually buy btc with futures)
Adoption increases - 99% of the population is still waiting on the sideline. Adoption is going to start taking off increasing the demand and price. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:08:10
Why not people have roommates?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:47:50
Sounds like solid news to me! A lot of experts have been predicting this for years. Maybe it will crash but it’s honestly a fucking guess so it doesn’t matter.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:37:39
Yeah I don’t think he gets what futures are...
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:02:53
Don’t buy on credit sell enough to cover that cost and hold the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:44:23
If they can make people believe in Scientology then fuck yeah Cryptology all the way!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:02:46
Keep investing a little bit into BTC and consider it a long term investment. Buy during  dips. Still plenty of growth opportunity for BTC. Based, on only a small fraction of the population is in BTC right now and is gaining momentum.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:32:43
Can’t tell if you’re a troll or just a dumb troll. Let me break it down for you....if you own .10 btc and the price of 1.0 Btc is 150,000 you will have 15,000.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:36:56
Sorry to hear that but if a 500 dollar hit could ruin your life so bad you shouldn’t have put that into btc man.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:01:54
Ah, thanks for the correction to much propaganda and bullshit being peddled to stoke fear. But, to answer your question China has already banned crypto their economy is no joke. Crypto is stronger than ever.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:55:10
What’s the source for this? Also not that fucked plenty of govs have banned crypto and we are stronger than ever lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:35:58
You honestly think buying risky investments on a credit card is a good idea? Do you have the money on hand to pay the balance off? If not you are looking at 17-25% interest likely. I guess you could have a 0 interest rate for 12-18 months but still can you pay it off by then?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:21:53
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:56:45
I think once scaling is solved won’t have to worry about this and can continue using btc for purchases.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:03:56
I mean no one knows wtf futures are by reading all these posts...whose going to even pay attention to the shorts. All I know is no btc is actually bought with futures.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:29:31
I don’t buy this shit man. Please, delete and slap yourself for us.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:38:42
Everyone has been waiting for the dip and it has come!
