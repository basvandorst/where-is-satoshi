Less than its currently worth so a Sat would have to be worth even more than 3.17

 My plan for LTC and ETH is to cash out if they reach just under the tax threshold and enjoy the money. However my BTC is never for sale.

I think it will have to start with it having a comparable fiat value whilst being a globally accepted currency alongside.

3.17 pence per Sat sounds ambitious to me.

I think maybe I didn't explain it too well. How is it decided how many satoshis my wages will be worth when the change happens?

I understand how trade works. Its how that will be given a Sotoshi value....who decides how many its worth?

But does this still hold true when its a brand new currency that isn't valued against any other currency in the market place? I'm talking about Bitcoin being the sole currency of the Earth and everyone has had a 'money' reset (which I also struggle to see how my GBP in my bank account will be converted to Bitcoin)

That's pretty ambitious!

Thank you for this :)

But people won't know....I mean for example, the known currency ends and bread is no longer worth £1, its worth 10 Satoshi's. People need to buy their bread so they will just pay it. Someone has decided that price for the bread. That price will be made up on the cost of ingredients, labor, transport, building costs, profit etc....but who decided what all those entities are worth? Will the world just say 1 Satoshi = 1 US cent for a starter to get things sorted?

I wouldn't like to explain it in case I give misinformation and it causes someone to be on the wrong side of the law. If the value of my coins get to a certain point I will be consulting with a financial advisor

Thank you for the info. 
I have been trying to understand more about it rather than just buying some without knowledge (but I do have issues with how fast I learn new things)
I'm just really interested in what would happen if tomorrow all fiat ceased to exist and Bitcoin became the currency.

I can't quite work out if you are looking at it from the point of view to making profit by investing, in which case it just like stocks, buy low sell high. If you view it like a lot of Bitcoin advocates, in which it is seen as a global currency, the price you pay don't really matter as long as you've got some as there will be a finite number available.
