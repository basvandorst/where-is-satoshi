So I should have taken one for the team? Is what yer saying?

I created the RMA request through my BFL account today and literally heard from them 20 minutes later saying they shipped my replacement unit and provided a tracking number.... I was very surprised.
I still don't like them though.... and the miner really isn't even worth running anymore in my opinion. 10Gh/sec isn't getting me very far at all. But still... I paid for a product, it broke, just out of principle I want it replaced.
What vendor have you switched to?

Really? You didn't try to contact BFL at all? 
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:23:49
Thanks, I'll see if that works.
My main concern now though, is even if I do get a replacement,idk if I trust it to run 24/7 while I'm not home after seeing that. Makes me very uneasy.

I could never figure out how to take the case apart though... there are no screws. I see screw-like things that are completely flush with the metal case though on the top of the device...Or do you just pry the top off?

Hah, just said that cause it's fireproof. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:17:58
Yeah, I'd usually get 10.5 on average.
@_date: 2014-03-06 04:54:29
Yeah I know, I don't expect to hear anything probably. I left them an email already. I will probably try to call tomorrow during business hours.

I don't remember seeing any stickers on it, but I'd have to check when I am home next. One thing I found strange was there was no documentation or anything that came with the unit. Not even those little white folded pamphlets about it's specs/manufacturing and all that jazz.
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:11:40
Yeah, it's finally setting in now how scary the thought of this having happened while I was at work or something...

He is probably one of the most well-spoken men I have ever listened to. 
Breaks everything down quite nicely.

Bleh... it wasn't really doing much for me anyway. But still, principle of the thing. Only had it for 3 months and it blows up on me? Sheesh. FU ButterFly Labs

Pics wouldn't show much, maybe if I opened it up. Flames were coming out the vent though but it was only for a second or two.

Ah, thanks!
Do you know of people doing any other modifications to the boards once you take them out of the case? Setting up more fans or better airflow for them? Mounting liquid cooling blocks, etc?
