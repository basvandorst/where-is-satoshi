Amazing. Every word of what you just said.... Was wrong.

Are you joking? I cannot tell?

No problem, come to r/BitcoinUK there are a lot of tax questions in there and a few of us who will respond to queries regarding UK taxation.

But to throw a spanner into the works, he is also incorrect.
Exchanging between two different cryptocurrencies is a barter transaction, creating a disposal for tax purposes.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:56:10
Head on over to r/BitcoinUK 
There are a couple of guides as well as 3 or 4 tax related questions a day to look through. You'll probably find the answer you are looking for there. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:07:53
After the exemption any gains within the remaining lower rate band would be taxed at 10%, after that 20%.
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:53:35
Can you provide a reference to why you think this? perhaps to a manual or other part of legislation.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:03:43
Using bots, and day trading is likely to fall into income tax. Instead of Capital gains. 
Under capital gains a barter transaction is a disposal and a taxable event. I doubt this would kill day trading.
Under income tax, each of your trades would form part of your sales and expenses for the year, with a resulting profit or loss taxed as appropriate.

AML rules probably. And if they are doing that then they cannot tell you as it's a crime to "tip off" the potential money launderer. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 07:53:26
If it's anything like reality he would log on Reddit head on over to r/BitcoinUK and ask how to. He'd get an answer in a few hours.
Not a compelling storyline though.

Haha, now that could be confusing!

Then please use a comma as your thousands separator per the Queen's English not an apostrophe.

9 out of 10 start ups fail. Can't say I am surprised that majority would fail in this sphere as well. It's what the 1 in 10 that survive will offer that will change everything.

The only point I am trying to make is that the author was not wrong. 
Your argument was initially that the authors use of periods was wrong and to use English convention because we are speaking English. 
You now are using non English conventions to aid non native speakers. Perhaps that was the authors intention? Believing that using periods will make more sense to many more that the apostrophe (which are used by just Italy and Switzerland (I think)). 
Interestingly I believe the international standard is to not use commas, apostrophes or periods but just a space.
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:59:48
May not be wrong at all. Most of Europe write numbers as X.XXX,XX (periods for thousands and commas for decimals). Which is annoying to see as in the UK we use X,XXX.XX (comma for thousands and period for decimals). 
Same with putting the sign after the number. Depends where you are from whether it is right or not. 
I have never seen ' used for thousands - where are you from?
@_date: 2018-08-13 05:47:37
No it won't.

Hi, do you have a link to confirm that we get to choose the method for determining the cost of the sold Bitcoins? My understanding is they are treated as a security and therefore the share rules apply. E.g first cost attrubuted is cost of any Bitcoins bought on same day as the sale. Then on the cost of any Bitcoins bought in the next 30 days after sale. Then on an average over all other Bitcoins.. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:15:05
Also you'd have to move there for over 5 years. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:50:24
I see a lot of people saying that you are scuppered if you have already sold into fiat. However no one seems to have given a solution. 
If I am right, and any accountant or tax advisor worth his salt will be able to confirm this, then foreign currencies are treated as securities and therefore the cost basis for a capital gain transaction follows the same rules as for shares. Therefore you might be able to get out of the taxable event you have created by simply rebuying all the Bitcoins. Then you can approach a tax advisor and get some planning into how to mitigate the tax liability when you sell again. 
The above is due to the share matching rules. Being that the cost basis of a sale is based on any shares (or in our case Bitcoins) bought on the day of the sale, then any bought in the next 30 days then the pool of any others purchased. 
For the above to work you would need to re buy the Bitcoins within 30 days of selling them. 
Again get a tax advisor to confirm before acting. 
Just to add this is in the UK.

We have a thread on the r/bitcoinUK subreddit for any UK tax questions you might have after reading the guidance already posted.
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:15:56
In the UK a sterling equivalent would be attributed to the boat you are selling and taxes worked out that way. I can imagine it would be similar in the USA.
Actually to get really technical - in the UK depending on the facts of the case a boat may be classed as a wasting asset and therefore there might not be any capital gains at all.
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:39:55
Transaction fees in that block are less than half a bitcoin. Is OP sure the 2 BTC he thinks are lost to fees didn't in fact go to a change address?
@_date: 2019-08-17 13:05:44
Almost. Crypto is taxed at 10% within the basic rate tax band (after the allowance you mention) and 20% once you hit higher rates. The 28% is just for gains within the higher rate band from the sale of residential properties.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:10:01
If they are evading tax they are taking a risk that HMRC won't cotton on. If they do they will end up having to pay the tax and penalties.
If your talking avoidance then it's down to your personal tax planning. Coming up with a good plan costs money and the rich can afford it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:06:01
When you make a qualifying disposal is the point that capital gains (or losses) are calculated.
Swapping assets, so BTC for Euros. Is a qualifying disposal. As is swapping BTC for ETH or any other crytocurrency. It is not just when it finally makes its way back to GBP.
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:04:53
No. You'd need to move there. If you are tax resident in the UK you pay tax on worldwide income and gains. Including bitcoin sold into a German bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:08:56
Not if this tweet is anything to go by:
Apparently all the BTC1 nodes froze at block 494782 just before they were going to split. I suppose it would take someone to go and fix the code to get it up and running again?

As long as you don't have gains of more than £11,300 over all of your qualifying disposals (that's every trade of any asset) in a financial tax year you won't have to submit a return, or pay any capital gains tax.
But your spot on that irrespective of your income in the year, the full £11,300 allowance is available for capital gains.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:26:28
The £11,300 is a separate allowance. So it is irrespective of your full time employment income. So as u/Th3ophany says, if your gains are less than £11,300 you will not have any capital gains tax to pay or report.
If you were to sell now it would be in the financial tax year to 5th April 2018, and therefore unless you use the real time capital gains tax option through the government gateway (where you tell them and pay right now), you will need to set yourself up for self assessment, submit and pay your tax return by 31st January 2019

Do you have a link to where that the mistake has been corrected? Going through the draft on the website it still says Bcash is the original chain. I am reading paragraph 8.1.2.
Do not get me wrong, I definitely want you to be right.
Edit - saw the Twitter link to the edit below.  Great that they are fixing it. Just hope they get the edit onto the downloadable report quicker!

Tax advisor. If it was offered yes, yes I would. 15% - 25%, probably the lower end of the range to be honest.

The Pineapple fund is to make donations to worthwhile causes. I do not get the scammers logic that he can steal from the fund but its ok cause he was going to donate it somewhere else?

I believe it's there as the 2x chain is currently the BTC chain. As there has not yet been a split transacting on the 2x part of the wallet would be the same as transacting on the BTC chain. It is not 2x coins at the moment. 
Once the split had occurred you can transact on the separate chains by transacting on the 2x part of the ledger. 
Ledger have said they are working on 2x integration. So it may be that it's just a place holder at the moment I am not sure.

If your gains for the year are under the capital gains tax annual exemption of £11,300 then there is nothing to declare. (True in 99% of the cases, as usual with tax there are some outside exceptions). 
If you have made gains over the annual exemption you will be reporting your gains on your tax return and capital gains tax will be paid on them.

Two different allowances, Capital gains annual exemption that u/Disk0nnect is referring to used on your capital gains, and the annual allowance which is used on your income.

Etoro carry out lots of advertising at football grounds. In Southampton last season the bitcoin symbol kind of exploded out of the advert but this season there's no mention of bitcoin on the Etoro advert at all. I can only assume it wasn't catching on for them. I hope the more exposure people have to it the more normal and less scary it will become.

Can Bitcoin be "stored" anywhere? I mean where is Bitcoin located? Is it wherever the private key is at the time?
