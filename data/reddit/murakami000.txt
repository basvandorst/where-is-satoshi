Your btc are on the blockchain. The 24 words are just the bits of information used to derive your private key which is the treasure map with the x to your btc.

Investor A buys from Investor B a stock of Canadian dollars for €10.000. Investor A sells back to B the same stock of Canadian dollars for €10.100. 
Did the demand increase? Did the value of a Canadian dollar increase?

Why do you care about what satoshi nakamoto wanted? Bitcoin is democratic and it's whatever people want it to be. If it followed the will of satoshi nakamoto if would only be a useless FIAT ripoff.
Satoshi gave us an instrument. How we use it and what it will become is up to us and to whoever will come after us when we're dead.

Its not about being smart or having a good product. Bitcoin is the gateway for almost any other crypto because it has the first player advantage (and disadvantage). You won't have another Bitcoin and every project in the crypto verse will be tied to it in one way or another. Perhaps in some years good project will start to detach from btc thanks to a more widespread adoption, but you won't have a coin not tied to btc from day 1.

This is good. It means it's the best time to buy.

As an Italian I find this pretty fun. It was only a matter of time.

Why not just try to login to verify if your email really was changed?

It depends by a number of factors. Exchange adoption, merchants adoption, developers, hodlers, nodes and miners. Bitcoin is a social economy and its fate is decided by its actors.

Anything can be done as the code is open source. However, the majority of the nodes must agree to the changes or a fork will happen.

I don't care what bitcoin does right now. I only care about what it'll be in 10 years.

Bitcoin is pseudoanonymous which means that its users cannot be directly identified but can still be identified.

You're trolling, right?

Bitcoin is bitcoin. You won't find anything similar to it in human history. It's the first of its kind and the only way to understand it is to study it. Start with the white paper and focus on facts and not opinion. These subs are full of useless opinions.
And yes, people are making money around Bitcoin and the number is only going to grow, we're still in the early days.

What's the source for the italian media company? As an italian I find this pretty hard to believe. Nobody in my circle of acquaintances uses bitcoin to buy stuff online. I mean, I'd be happy if it was true...

Tell that to the people in Venezuela buying food with Bitcoin because of the hyperinflation of their money.
It's a large world, if it doesn't do anything for you doesn't mean it can't do anything for anyone.

99.99% bullshit. If people knew who satoshi was they'd abduct him/her/them and torture them until they got the keys to his/her/their bitcoins.

Nothing. I just keep buying btc whenever I can. I don't even look at the price swings anymore. Just hodling for the next 10 years and see what happens then.

Its a silly argument because it could be made for anything not deemed essential to sustain life.
Has anyone ever calculated the amount of energy and pollution and impact on the environment that comes from producing sex toys? Do we really need sex toys? Or, I don't know, chewing gums. You literally can't even eat chewing gums. Should we talk about tobacco? How many trees have been cut and energy wasted just to produce something plain bad for our health and make some few assholes rich as fuck?
I mean, seriously. Bitcoin can give us financial freedom and revolutionize the world as we've known it for centuries and people are talking about the energy cost? It's not even an argument, considering that Bitcoin can help develop renewable energy, as you mentioned.

Idk man, Im scared to do that. Crypto is way too volatile right now. I mean you can do that but is it really worth the risk when you can simply use fiat? 
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:02:08
I think spending btc is stupid anyway. Would you use gold to buy a pizza? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 06:16:54
Thats because when buying crypto you're not spending it but investing. It's (should) not lost money

WTF is Bitcoin Core. I've never heard it, never bought it, not listed on exchanges, not listed on coinbase, and certainly not in my portfolio.
Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin cash; Bitcoin is Bitcoin, so why change its name? It's not even good marketing for Bitcoin cash to be listed as Bitcoin because nowadays even financial newspapers lists the daily bitcoin price... and it's not called Bitcoin Core. Stop inventing names, you just look stupid.
The network invented Bitcoin cash when it forked, and that's fine. Nobody forked to Bitcoin Core, so it doesn't exist. It's fine to think that BCH is the "real" Bitcoin, otherwise BCH wouldn't exist, but seriously stop making up names for something that was born with a defined name. The Bitcoin chain is the original one as you can go back to the GENESIS BLOCK mined by Satoshi who called it Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Core. Everything else is crap talking.
