Sharing a private key protecting illegally acquired funds is money laundering in and of itself (if coins are spent from that address), so that defense doesn’t work.
By analogy, consider a mafia’s shared bank account. You put in your illegally gotten funds, mixing them in with everything else, and go to prison. If any money is spent from that account, even by someone else, you’re on the hook for money laundering.

Charged for money laundering, man. They can spend the coin on your behalf, but it’s illegal. Giving someone the wallet outright is also illegal.




(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity;

It’s not that hard if your wallet is being watched. I don’t see how you don’t get that.

You don’t understand. If your illegally acquired funds go on the move, you’re held accountable regardless of the mover.
Edit: and as for proving who holds the coin, that’s trivial with the techniques authorities currently use. Mixers aren’t foolproof.

Bitcoin transactions (like gold) are legally considered financial transactions as applied to this law. Money laundering laws also apply to non-fiat currencies, like gold. For the same reason, you can’t give someone gold acquired illegally.

You don’t understand. OP got a plea deal for turning his coin in. If you don’t turn it in, they’ll pinch you for the full sentence. They can do that.

Tell me then. How would you offload your coin while imprisoned? Your wallet is being watched, and any transaction will result in you being charged again.

Come again?

Yeah, but you know who owns the wallet and you know that the proceeds of criminal activity are held in that wallet. You see a transaction coming out, you arrest the owner of the wallet for money laundering. The transaction goes through, but you get a hefty federal prison sentence.

Couldn’t have said it better.

Sure they can, that’s felony money laundering.

Also, if you refuse to give them your money, they’ll just watch the address. If money comes out, they’ll bust you again and take whatever you bought with it, making the coin useless as is.

Bitcoin is traceable and transactions aren’t anonymous. If OP had Monero or something, it would be different, but they didn’t.

“OK. We can give you 24 months in federal penitentiary, or, if you don’t want to give us your private keys, we’ll push for 10-30 years.”
