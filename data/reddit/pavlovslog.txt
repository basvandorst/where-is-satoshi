Does this work if you're at 0 confirmations?

I tried doing that too and didn't see one that really answered my questions, particularly about if I can up the fee or do anything at this point to push it through or call it back. If you know or can Reference an article I'd appreciate it if not no worries thanks I'll keep scrolling

Ahh ok. So heres the thing for me. I sent it as a donation to EFF so I don't know if anyone can send me anything back or would be willing to look and find it. Im guessing that money is just gone, was only like $20 though, not nothing but not a lot. Bummer.

I did do a search, and the results that come up are many with lots of technical info Im not totally familiar with and even more topics that don't match with what I am looking for. I tried searching for keywords, but as you know I can't search the whole question so then Im left putting in keywords that bring up thousands of responses that don't get to the heart of the issue for me. If you have a better way Im all ears, but I don't have hours to spend at work searching and checking every post from years back. Seriously though, if you have a better system for me to search other than typical Boolean string type stuff I'd love to hear it because it would save me time here and on other reddit searches. Thanks

Is it possible to use this method with zero confirmations? Would you have to have the exact same amount with a fee on top?
