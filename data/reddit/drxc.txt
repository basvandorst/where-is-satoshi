Sounds like you have got it sorted then. Just don't lose the password...

You have to balance the risk of your keys being stolen, and the risk you you losing access to them (disk failure, forgetting the password, etc.)

Rise above
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:52:18
Both ways
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:49:54
Am I the only one a little underwhelmed?
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:38:00
You sound like my boss.

To answer your first question, read the release notes to 0.15.1

Transferring a number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) into a new, single UTXO while the fees are low enough to make it practical.

I mean, it has taken months and it's still only minimal, rudimentary support with a lot of caveats. I'm sorry, I know even being slightly negative gets you accused of being a paid shill but whatever.

This is terrible advice

Buy a lot at once
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:06:34


Good luck with that

**Not annoying:**
"Do you accept Bitcoin?"
"OK. I'll pay with VISA."
"Do you accept Bitcoin?"
"Really? You totally should. Let me explain..."
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:18:25
No that's just an example of bigger.
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:07:00
Do nothing. Your existing bitcoin will be on both chains.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:20:32
Do you know why that is? Because there is very low demand for BCH transactions. Blocks are 5% the size of Bitcoin's.
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:12:07
You mean the 2x fork. Electrum alreay supports SegWit.

Don't keep BTC on coinbase. Use it to buy/sell only and immediately transfer to an actual bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:53:09
I don't feel bad for them because letting an exchange keep your coins is fucking retarded and always has been.
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:23:42
The maximum fee is 21 million BTC.

It's not the seed but a PIN (perhaps 4 to 8 digits). It's supposed to be memorable but it sounds like OP did not memorise it.

Karpeles is a big part of bitcoin history.
You might not like him, but no history of Bitcoin would be complete without a chapter on the MtGox debacle.
@_date: 2016-07-03 06:10:51
That's not how history works. You shouldn't just delete the parts you didn't like.
