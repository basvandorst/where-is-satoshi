It's going to crash so hard and a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money.

Expect it to settle around 4K, then drop even further still.

It's because there are a ton of people who have been holding at a loss for 2 years.  A ton of people who doubled their money in a week. 
Plenty of reasons to sell.
Bitcoin is not a currency, it's a volitile stock that can be used as a currency.
A lot of people are going to lose a lot of money because of the circle jerk "to the moon" bullshit that happens here.
Good luck, be safe

Price literally went parabolic.  
This is a correction from the people who bought in at 650 2 years ago, getting the fuck out.  Taking a profit. 
Anyone who didn't see this coming a mile away should not trade bitcoin, ever.  This correction was a gimme-putt as far as trading goes.  
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:03:35
Except when you lose thousands due to price drops or phishing or hacking or shady exchanges or or or
Bitcoin is risky as fuck.  It will never be mainstream.  It's a delusional circle jerk.
How many exchanges have taken peoples money and folded?  Gox for starters. 
Remember Butterfly labs?  My ASIC was shipped a year late and arrived with dust in the fan vent.  Overheated and died 3 months later.
At every turn, someone is trying to steal your coin.  Losing your entire coin stash is as easy as clinking the wrong link.  That is why this will never go mainstream. 
I've been a Bitcoiner since the price was $.50 per coin.  I've made over 100k on it, as a casual.  
But this notion the bitcoin will replace fiat is horseshit nonsense that gives people false hope and can be dangerous to the uneducated.

Been Bitcoining since 2011.   Made a ton, got out recently.   Not saying it won't moon, not saying it'll crash to zero, but I think the idea of mainstream adoption is so far off that it shouldn't even be in the conversation.
The idea of a typo or a hack or a virus being able to wipe out an entire wallet of coin is a barrier that, if not solved, will prevent adoption on a "moon" scale.
By all means invest, use, trade bitcoin, but for the love of god don't go all in on some "moon" hope.

The market is trying to figure out what bitcoin is worth.  This might take years.  It's very indecisive right now. 
You ever wait for your girlfriend to get ready for a night out?  Bitcoin is at the "just decided on where to eat" phase, and now she's digging around in the closet trying to pick out an outfit. 
She'll go from pants to an evening gown and back.  We're not anywhere near the 'picking out the shoes' phase.  
Bitcoin is trying to get dressed.  Just play some angry birds and watch sportscenter.

I buy when I can.  I'm not in it for a small incremental profit.  I'm in it for the long haul.  Buying at $64 or $59 doesn't matter much when you're looking down the road at $1000/btc

After this, I'm never doing another transaction with them again.  They've lost my confidence, and with Bitcoin, confidence in the system is EVERYTHING.  (see 2011)
My coins are gone from my coinbase account, and I'm not even seeing a 'pending' anymore.  Just a NEGATIVE balance of BTC.  
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:45:23
Honestly, I said the same thing of "I'll wait till it dips" at 15, 20, and 30.  I was buying in here and there throughout, but I think you'll just want to pick up a coin right now.  Overall $2 won't make a difference, if you're expecting it to go to $60, or $70, which I think will happen in the next couple months.

Would it really grind everything to a halt?
@_date: 2013-09-05 15:58:49
You'd be better off putting that money into BTC (considering the sharp dip in price over the last 2 days)
These little devices are fun, and a good way to get people interested in BTC ("hey, check this out") as well as a good way to learn more about BTC (wallets, mining, difficulty, hash rates, the blockchain). 
It's such a small investment, I really wouldn't worry about profit.  Even if you buy in for that much and btc jumps $100, you've only made $33.   
Probably why, in the ebay listing, the seller uses the phrase "It serves as a replacement of GPUs for mining hobbyists"
Hobbyists - not profiteers. 
Good luck out there!
@_date: 2013-05-23 19:00:40
Well trading is still available on Gox, but I think there's a lot of ppl in a 'wait and see' holding pattern right now. 
You'll notice a lot of the trading is being done by bots 
Once the holding pattern 'breaks', it'll most likely take a sharp turn.  Whether it's up or down nobody knows.

Coinbase makes it really easy, but they're currently out of stock :/
Unless you're planning on selling the btc quickly, it's not really a big deal to wait the handful of days while you wait for your btc to arrive.  Kind of fun watching the price go up, knowing you're locked into a lower price. 
Also, I hope for the sake of my buddy this isn't a bubble... he's got just over 1,000 coins.

Streamline btc poker so it closely resembles Full Tilt poker:
-Account creation and BTC purchasing all in one signup flow (think coinbase but with poker attached). 
-BTC are stored in your account w/ current monetary value displayed 
-You can choose to bet in BTC increments or USD.  If you bet $5 USD, it will do the math and convert that into however many btc it is.
Make it streamlined and easy for the layman.  The closer you can get it to Full Tilt's 'feel', the easier it'll be to get ppl to buy in. 
I say this as someone who didn't know what BTC was some time ago, but got into it because I wanted to play online poker again.  The whole process as a newcomer was convoluted enough to turn non-techies off.
Make it as easy as:  Create username, create password, how much do you want to buy in with, pay, receive btc and start playing.    
@_date: 2013-03-12 18:52:45
My girlfriend showed me the price when it was at $36 on her btc app.  I said "woah!" then went back to eating my dinner.  By the time dessert was ready it was back at $45.
I think after last week's drop and rebound, we'll start seeing less panic when the price dips, leading to smaller dips.

I use bitcoin.clarkmoody.com
Under the 'selling' column, the 'ask' price is what ppl have put sell at orders in for, and the 'size' is how many btc are at that price.  
Once all the btc at that price are bought up, it moves down to the next highest price, increasing the current btc price.   Big numbers under 'size' for the selling columns are referred to as walls, or downward pressure, as the price can't increase until the wall has been bought up. 
Under the buying column, the exact opposite is true.  Big numbers under 'size' are referred to resistance, or support.  If there is 1500 buy orders in at $103, then in order for the price to drop below that, all 1500 orders have to be filled.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:07:26
seems like people are licking their wounds, waiting to see what happens.  There are buy orders but volume is low. 
Once someone who sold high moves back in we'll see another surge.  
Or not.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:19:11
Yeah, putting timescales on it isn't the best idea.  There are some panicked sellers right now, but there are so many buyers laying in wait.  Demand is so high we should see this bounce back up forthwith.

Coinbase is now taking orders for bitcoin.  as of  just this minute.  11:24am PST
@_date: 2013-03-22 15:53:25
I know that before I got in, I had these (admittedly selfish) feelings toward BTC in that I hoped it failed.  Why?  Because I didn't want to have the feelings of intense regret in not buying in, knowing that I could have made tens of thousands of dollars, but didn't because I didn't want to take a risk. 
So, I get why people want it to fail.  Jealousy and regret. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 15:57:29
I believe the first major correction will be from 150 down to 100, or something similar.  There will be drops ramping up to that, like the most recent 49 -&gt; 35.  
Ever since it hit $20, there have been talks of 'this is the top'.  I'm looking down the road several years, so any downward fluctuations dont' really bother me.

What about the psychology of people;  i.e:  Let's hypothetically say that the recent $1million purchaser decides to sell after seeing a good profit, which causes a noticeable drop in price.  If this triggers other sell-offs, could that have a snowball effect?  $1-3 drop isn't very much, but what if we see a $10 drop over a week?  The factors listed above notwithstanding, how does psychological element factor in?

He's playing semantics, but to simplify:
Last week, 1btc/day was about the average.  This week, 1btc/1.5 days.  However you want to phrase it, either 'expected rate of return' - fine, the flow of btc coming into my wallet due to running the miners is decreasing.

Looks like trades are still happening which is good.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:24:18
Hold.   It back up to $38 already, from $33 1/2 hr ago.    Think long term. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 16:26:54
I can't imagine a $7,000 miner ever paying for itself when you factor in electricity cost and difficulty.  Just doesn't seem feasible, especially by the time they would arrive.  
These companies are going to make millions selling what is going to amount to worthless hardware.   
Been mining 2 batch 2 Avalon ASICS for about 2 weeks and have a little over 12BTC to show for it.  Electricity cost is about $200/month, and the rate of return is noticeably declining each day. 
BTC is going to have to make a HUGE jump in price to make these things even remotely worth it. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:49:05
Haha, forgot about this comment. 
Guess it DID do a huge jump.  I'd be curious as to what the return would be once you actually received the batch 2 cointerra.
Both our Asics have since burned out - one literally went up in smoke, and the other died after enabling the wireless card for some reason.. :( 
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:36:27
yeah take a screenshot

And by 'shipped' they mean 'handed a partially working unit to someone across the room and plugged it in'
@_date: 2013-02-28 23:40:44
I see someone downvoted this comment.  We cannot downvote these types of comments because these are real concerns from someone who has not yet bought into bitcoin.  
I'm sure there are a lot of people who hold similar views, and if they're ignored/downvoted then it's counter-productive on what we're trying to do; bring new people into btc (among other things). 
I believe the buy in will always be too high if you're not convinced that btc is here to stay.  People had the same concerns at 4, 10, 20, 30, and now 33 dollars.  It will be the same at 40, 50, 100, etc

I bought my Avalon batch2 miner preorder when btc was ~$26. 
So at today's price, I will need to mine 21btc to recoup my investment.  
@_date: 2013-02-12 23:56:29
Wow thanks!  That's great information.  It all makes sense. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:18:36
You're right - either way it's a great lesson.  I would be proud to have my child approach me with their own money, saying they want to invest instead of spend it.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:54:49
Awesome rally in the last 15 mins... been fun to watch walls falling.  
cool site.

Indeed.  The one time I sold, I immediately started thinking "I gotta get some more bitcoin". 
Haven't sold since
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:44:59
Just because fewer people carry cash, doesn't mean it's not a viable alternative.  
What's bitcoin's viable alternative?  Pre printed paper wallets?  How would you verify their balance?

@_date: 2013-10-02 18:18:45
Could be a double dip, yes.  Volume is at 32k at bitstamp with the price rising.  You just don't know with this btc thing.  
@_date: 2013-05-17 16:53:25
It seems it would take a lot of coin to make that worthwhile, considering the fees involved and the price only moved a couple dollars.  But yeah, that can be done.

Bought more on coinbase at 87.

Any truth to the article that says batch 2 should ship in early april?  
Getting antsy to start making some coin!

Avalon batch 2 user not affected
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:16:59
Very well put.  Their model is so very convenient, however they are seemingly in over their heads at this point in time.  Once they catch up infrastructure-wise, their service they provide will once again become usable.   
Here is the canned response one can expect from emailing coinbase about their account:

Sorry about this - we are experiencing technical problems which cause user accounts to display incorrectly. Your bitcoin is safe!

@_date: 2013-12-06 20:28:57
I would buy right now.
@_date: 2013-08-09 20:34:13
Pretty damn angry, still haven't received our pair of Batch 2 Avalons.  No response from them on this matter, either. 
@_date: 2013-02-15 18:52:41
well you can buy the btc at whatever the current price is, but you won't get the actual coin for about a week or so.  You're still locked into the price you buy it at regardless of if it goes up or down
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:48:07
$450 invested in 23.5 coins. 
Have 1 friend with 1000 coins and 1 with 6000+ coins.   They all bought in at around $16
@_date: 2013-03-12 19:00:35
Exactly, I can wait 10 years, because I'm taking a stab at BTC one day paying for my newborn's college education (maybe they'll even take BTC for tuition by then!)  Obviously I'm saving as if I didn't have any BTC in case it doesn't work out, but if one day I look up and it's $1000 a coin, I'll be a happy man. 
So yeah, little fluctuations aren't affecting me as my intended goals are much 'bigger picture'.  That's why I'll buy at 38, or I'll buy at 48, when I have a few extra bucks around.  The small margins aren't of much concern. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:18:37
Mine isn't even pending anymore, it's just fucking gone. 
2.1 btc transfer to my local wallet, the website froze.  Hit 'cancel' and reopened coinbase.com.  Now I'm showing a NEGATIVE BTC balance, and there isn't even a 'pending' transcation anymore.  They're just gone.  
There goes $150 out the window. 
@_date: 2013-03-01 17:38:49
I see your point about terrorists - how easy it would be to move large sums of money.  
To your second point - if I was willing to accept money in exchange for bitcoin, or vice versa, being that it's a p2p currency, how would anyone stop me and the other party from making that transaction? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:27:42
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:27:06
Glad to see them accepting BTC, but damn what a collection of shitholes!
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:57:10
Just ordered a case.  Is there an email confirmation or tracking number for the shipment?  Thanks!
*edit:  Nevermind!  Clicked through and used my eyes to read the instructions.   Handy! 
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:58:14
I agree, confidence in btc is everything, and my confidence is about gone with coinbase. 
Also, I have another 2btc hitting my coinbase account tonight, further adding to the woes.   Do I immediately try to transfer them out or wait until they resolve my 1btc discrepancy?
Argh. 
@_date: 2013-02-12 16:12:46
Too fast. 
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:29:59
Unless you already have your mining hardware, don't bother getting any. 
Just buy BTC and hold.

Not necessarily.  In the link above, there was a 2 day outage in the northeast that affected millions of people.  This would grind btc to a halt and people would have to revert to fiat.

Haha I just realized the eurozone is in for a shock when they wake up and check the price.  Lol.

Maybe.  This stability is due mostly to the DHS investigation, which is completely different from previous stable periods.

Ah, that makes sense, thanks for the answer.  Now that they have their funding and preorders are filled, whats to stop them from pushing back delivery for a week or so, and letting them mine for a little while before sending them out?

@_date: 2013-02-18 21:05:05
Pardon my ignorance, but what is a 51% attack and why is it feared?   I assume that the 51% means someone has reached a majority of all the hashing power out there.

Been mining 2 Avalon Batch 2's for exactly 7 days now, getting about 1 BTC per day.  
Both will be paid off in just over a month at the current price.    
Of course that rate will slowly decline over time.
