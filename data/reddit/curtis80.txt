Agreed, bitgold.com

I'm not sure what it means.. but the more likely scenario than what you've suggested is the net assets of the ETF.. (how ever many BTC it holds has some relative value to 65M or so they hope)

She's probably 40 years old and has more world experience than most.  I'm sure they're fully capable of expressing opinions on economics without hurting each others feelings.

It's a function of cash flow in vs the deflation that you're mentioning..  in-flows are very high right now.

Feeling even better now? :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:44:51
I could be wrong.. it has surprised me to the upside before.. but this IS a downtrend..maybe if it rose to $980-$1000+ you could consider it to be recovering..
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:25:37
This isn't over yet.. wait for $200
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:56:03
Well that's a pretty large leap from today.. China is more interested in working with Russia who might develop their own digital currency anyway,  
Party members would probably disappear forever if they admitted to owning it.  Just a guess.
I am thinking it remains a western thing for a long time.. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:40:19
I said it would go LOWER
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:22:09
Loss of bid support also means it can go to zero with no ability to get your USD back.. ie. Bag Holders

Possibly.  On the other hand,  I am a fully exposed geek.  I follow BTC daily.  I follow economic news and stock markets minute by minute.  Debt?  Tapering?  I'll take physical silver and gold over BTC any day of the week.  Whats hilarious is that BTC 1 day chart for 6 months just finished making a mirror image of the gold chart for the past 15 years.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:23:41
Oct 15 - Baidu accepts Bitcoin was around when the price started to move up significantly.  Without that event it may have never run up like it did...It went from $150 to $200 and never looked back.
Dec 5 - People's Bank of China banned financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions..  This was the key.. somehow it took until the next day for the news to sink in.
Dec 6 - Baidu Stops Accepting Bitcoins After China Ban..  and all downhill since...
So, there never was policy to change per say.. but now there may never be.. the Chinese gov't has been buying gold and telling the people to buy gold so they are not about to throw that away.  Just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:41:21
Agreed.  Even my "tech savvy" grandparents would put it in the closet without ever touching it again or knowing what it is...
I'd go with silver.. same purpose but it's physical and nice too look at.. older folks respect gold/silver
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:13:04
Ya, true enough.. I guess it has to do with mainstream adoption.. If it became mainstream it could be $10,000 USD with all the inflows that would happen in becoming mainstream..  If it's only geeks then it might as well remain at 200 USD.  If banks dont use it (not saying they would control it) then 99% of people won't use it.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:45:32
Nope, China is all about the gold.  BTC is competition.  As i pointed out 6 days ago before the ban.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:23:45
Yes - That mumbo jumbo is also called an accurate analysis.  You go ahead and stay with the dumbed down version i provided for you.
For how many years have you analyzed and traded stocks?  Oh, that's what i thought.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:31:22
A method of technical analysis that some traders use..  You don't need to know why.  It doesn't matter.  Use support and resistance and trends to see where the price might go..  Just go with risk/reward ratios and pick your entry exit points based on resistances and supports.. sell if you are wrong and your stop loss is taken out..  I can speculate as to why certain price happened or might happen.. but it's not really important.  
As for my speculation...An interesting thing about BTC as opposed to stock markets is that when ppl are selling BTC their money is likely on the sidelines ONLY to re-enter the BTC market.  So, it's a much easier game to play.. there are always suckers ('small money') dying to rebuy their BTC.  Normally after someone sells a stock you can expect they'll go buy some other stock.
So, the further down BTC goes the more dry powder there is that'll come back in.. We hit and bounced off 650.. and we'll probably go there again.. But it'll take a lot of selling to get below it..  All these guys selling at 700-800 are coming back eventually..if not at 650 then definitely if it got to 400 they'll all get back in..  buying opportunity of their lifetime..  That's all i'm basing that guess on..
Set your bitconwisdom chart to 4 hour and the price history tells you where support is.. 800, 650, and 400 all are clearly identified in the past.. 
Not sure this is really what you were talking about.. but my two cents..
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:15:41
As far as the USD goes.. China supports gold and BTC isn't in that game.  But, that's just my feeling on the subject.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:04:01
It's all risk versus reward.  If there is a small likelihood of upside then there's no point in owning it - especially for the large accounts.  So, above 1200 we have seen major exits over the past week - that's all fine and understandable.  But, will that money return??  Will other money flow in to continue the price expansion?  When that money left it pushed below $1000 and if money doesn't start flowing back in then other money will start to leave.. 
Breaking $1250 would take a lot more money in circulation or some much stronger adoption.  If it cant be seen as going to break $1250 then why bother risk ownership at $1000.
Forget the technicals...China is against it and that's 1/5 people in the world.  
Anyway, I'm completely bias at this price level of bitcoin.. I'd rather take $1000 to the bullion exchange and walk out with four 10 oz bars of silver rather than walk away from the Vancouver Bitcoin ATM with a receipt for 1 digital bitcoin.
Oh, and i'd say $400 realistically is possible, probably not $200..
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:48:05
Yeah.. there's definitely enough people with "small money" on the sidelines that would keep it above $400.  
The direction from here is anyones guess.. it could test $1000 or $800.  But the near term trend is down.. and more often than not trends eventually break support.. so it could be down to $640 if $800 can't hold.. and then to $400 if a further major break down were to occur..
Long term.. it could still be $2000.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:51:28
They aren't afraid of it.  But it does pose, albeit tiny at current, a risk to their ability to manipulate currency and trade.  Why *would* they allow it?
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:59:48
You're refering to the people?  Who have no say in the matter.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:27:10
Hahah yeah.  Tough to say where we go from here.. I spent my $10 at 755.. but not sure it will hold $800..!  I should prob dump it and wait again..!
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:32:46
In all seriousness, i think $400 is realistic...  the sellers and outflows are winning right now... and just because it bounces for 10 minutes doesn't mean anything.  It took weeks to get up high and it could trend down for weeks..  More importantly, the news out of China is insanely bad for bitcoin.  
Whoever is buying today - Is gambling.  Never try to catch a falling knife.  (Unless it's for fun,.and you can afford it)
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:35:42
I've never had much more than 0.01 and i sold when it hit $990 the first time.  
I thought about bidding at $800 but i think it goes lower.  BTC is just for fun for me...I'm more of a gold and silver kind of investor.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:08:12
Yeah, there is a lot of fear and panic today..
But, I guess i see it quite differently.. China is not for it.. that's as good as against it.  The highest price targets for BTC depended on this kind of wide acceptance..  
The PBOC decision forced Baidu's hand.. it may turn out to be  unwise to hold BTC in China or sell asap.. who knows, maybe BTCChina will shut down.  
Maybe the volume on BTCChina will be telling..

Because reading opinions of major bulls is misleading in any stock/commodity/currency.
