I purchased two of these awhile back in the eventual plan of dumping some money in and diversifying my Blockfolio. Let's see if it works out for me Cotton.

Thanks. I've got an even mix of ETH and Ripple. This morning hasn't been terrible for me. I personally think it's good for the long game. Good luck to you.

So can I ask: Do you own any crypto? And if so, which coin(s)?
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:58:27
The letters. Next question please.

RemindMe! 3 months

Mmmhmmmm. A hell of a lot more.

So does my Blockfolio.

Yeah boiiii.
But for real. Pretty neat stuff. Would like to see a jump in value tonight as Asia gets off work in a couple hours. We already hit the dip for the night here in the US.

I’m by means no expert. I did buy in at $83 though so I got lucky!
I think we’ll see a couple of days of sideways value before we get another boost. But I DO think it’s coming. I’m not basing that on anything other than my own speculation and looking at recent trends.
I ALSO think we could see a big boost Friday morning. Payday for people still trying to get in sub $500.
So, 2 weeks of course. Ha What do you think?

They use their stash to incite partners to be the first in their industry to adopt their services. I believe they can choose either 300 million XRP or 300 million USD. They also have a large portion locked away in escrow and release a bit every month. Keeps the price down or to a manageable level or something idk.
I’m an expert in crypto. Been here for a couple weeks. AMA.
