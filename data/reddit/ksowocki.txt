It does, but
* it'd be easy to but build one that doesn't use scripts.
* that kind of misses the point; why not allow publishers to solicit payment for their content?

Ublock is on the list of adblockers to test!  


Interesting, I wonder how ad blocking on outlook works (esp considering there is not javascript enabled in emails)

Thanks, hopefully we'll see it or something similar in the wild in the near future;  Once we have some data showing that people *will* actually support their publishers using it we'll know if this is a possible model for publishers going forward.

Look at the PR.  Bitcoin classic has &gt; 75% consensus.  In fact, it has &gt; 90% consensus.

it's a long essay.  you thought *all* of it was dead on?

You know the price is $430 right now, right?

@_date: 2016-01-15 00:08:02
