Very convincing.

What Paypal integration?

Thanks for reposting 5 days old news. 
Really, your site is complete shit. Nothing but stupid click bait only a 12 year old would fall for. Do the world a favor and close it. At least stop spamming it here.

That for now it's useless for the average person. 
Also there is nothing wrong with running Windows (7).

Look before posting man. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:11:42
Thanks. I missed it the 30 times it was posted 5 days ago.

Hilarious how lately people already post how Bitcoin is relevant in the title because they know it isn't. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 02:21:59
This is a copy and paste from somewhere else and simply spammed here for the traffic.

Tanking a bit. Just 70% or so. No big deal. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 09:40:06
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 10:47:03
People still buy miners? Seriously?

Bitcoin user also affected. 
The op won't be happy that you stopped his circle jerk. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:26:56
Man, your site is one of the worst Bitcoin sites i've seen. Do us all a favor and stop posting it here. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:16:38
Downvoted ofcourse. We're not allowed to mention such things here. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 10:26:41
Bullshit. These people are islamic animals who's only goal in life is to exterminate every single jew alive. In name of their religion and god. And they'll gladly use innocent Palestines to achieve that goal.

I wonder how all you people who post this crap function day to day in the real world. Your life must be so fucked up.
