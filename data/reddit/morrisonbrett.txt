I attended his meetup event in Santa Monica, California last month. I listened, and tried to understand where he's coming from.
Since then, I became curious to how his mind works.  I've watched his interviews, both old ones from the early days of Bitcoin, and his new ones, where he sticks to his talking points and tries to manipulate anyone who will listen to his ways of thinking.
I consider Bcash an alt-coin.  His efforts are an attack on Bitcoin.  I wish I knew why he woke up one day and decided to abandon the invention that he once loved so much, take his ball from the playground, and become a crusader for an alt-coin.  Energetically, it wasn't a healthy action to take for his own mental fitness and basic human grounding.  Instead he's chosen to spend a tremendous amount of time, energy, and money on his intent to destroy what he helped promote.
I just don't understand why he couldn't continue to try diplomacy to address his concerns (scaling) and why he finally gave up.  Instead - he chose to declare a war.

Maybe 2 beers isn't valid.  Trying again.

A friend commented on my Facebook wall defending Newsweek and said, "Bitcoin is a lighting rod of a company".  Sigh.  It really does remind me of 20 years ago, trying to explain the Internet to people.

Seems to be working fine. Not sure how to measure that draw.

I decided to recommend NTFS for people that may want to transfer the Blockchain from a Windows machine. I'll update the post to state this so it's more clear as to why.

I'm using an old Western Digital USB 2.0 drive. The Raspberry Pi is powered just via normal Micro USB. Seems to be working fine.
I boot from the SD card.

Nice job, OP.  For fun, consider porting it to Golang!

Exactly. That's a procedure by itself but yes, and that's one of the reasons I recommend using an NTFS drive so you have the option of doing that from Windows.
