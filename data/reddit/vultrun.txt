I don’t disagree. But if you are attacking our product, our payouts are all on-chain and you can do whatever you want with your BTC. And you get your BTC hourly as you work. So we don’t hold it for a long period. I suppose you run the risk for the first hour you work but you’ll quickly realize at the end of that hour whether or not you got your BTC with our system (we are definitely not scamming).  Anyway, just trying to provide more info. People can choose to use our system or not. But I’m 100% a believer in the future of BTC (and only BTC).

Well you get hired by a client, it is just the payout happens hourly. Each party can cancel the remainder of an engagement too (but only hours that begin at least an hour from the cancellation). And if you blow off your work, you likely won't get hired by the client again and will get a bad rating. I'm guessing most clients will let you go to the bathroom (like any hourly job/gig where you get paid hourly).

Of course. Some people don't have access to funds for days or weeks after working. Some people don't have bank accounts. Some people don't have established relationships with people that hire them and may not trust them to definitely pay. And more.

I’m all for the future of BTC but at the present it is difficult to do peer to peer hourly payments and the parties would still need to pay the transaction fees for that work. And quite honestly you need both the hiring party and the professional to be familiar with and comfortable with BTC, and we haven’t reached that stage in most industries yet.

That’s a flat out Ponzi scheme dude. I hate whenever anybody gets screwed, but be careful. I hate also that legit uses of bitcoin and crypto get lumped in with these scam sites by the general public.

Yeah, I would be interested in Racetams too. There are harder to find each passing day around where I live..
