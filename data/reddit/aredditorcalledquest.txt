You might be able to find an exchange that lets you use a prepaid credit card instead.

Anyone who writes crypto off as something used mostly for illegal activity hasn't actually done their research.

Doge! So crypto! Such moon!

Possible? Sure. But I don't think it's very likely. The support for BTC (and cryptocurrency in general) keeps increasing as the public becomes more aware of it. We've passed the point where it's just a handful of every day nerds playing with it, hell we're just now passing the point where it's individual millionaires playing with it. Even the institutional level players are getting involved now, which lends even more credibility to crypto as a concept.

I don't know if you have any kind of direct to customer enterprise going on, but you could always accept payment for things in cryptocurrency. I've seen some places offer a discount to be paid in BTC or LTC instead of fiat.

Find a wallet you can install on a thumb drive, put BTC on there with a cool certificate and some literature called "WTF is BTC?"

Is that the next clickbait article? How Millennials Are Ruining Bitcoin?

I just downloaded the Coinbase app and bought mine there. It takes a few minutes to set it up but it's pretty self explanatory. You'll probably want to move your BTC out of Coinbase (which is an exchange) into a wallet of some kind eventually, but you don't absolutely *need* one to get started.

No problem. Good luck out there!

That the statement is simply untrue. I saw an article recently about a Canadian University of some sort taking BTC for tuition payments.

We've clearly had very different experiences. Everyone I know personally is treating it the way they would an investment in a new foreign currency.

I check it pretty regularly just out of curiosity, but I force myself to stick to my purchasing schedule and buy on pay day.

I don't think anyone can accurately predict what BTC (or really any currency) is going to do from day to day, but the community as a whole seems pretty confident that the general upward trend in BTC will continue at least into next year.

I just opened it on mine. Works fine for me.

Coinbase has disabled Bitcoin transactions in anticipation of the fork already so whatever you have on there is staying there until after the dust settles. I left my Coinbase alone since I don't really think they're going to lose my money.

Just a friendly heads up: Defacing currency in this manner may be seriously illegal in your country. By all means, do it anyway if you want, just know whether or not you're taking a serious risk.

Would it be fair to say that BTC is the safest bet within the crypto-sphere?

Currency speculation is absolutely something that people do regularly with fiat currencies.  Plenty of people did exactly what we're doing with BTC when the Euro came out.  Not only is Bitcoin a young currency, but it's also a brand new type of currency so its relative value is bound to swing wildly for a while and people are going to try to capitalize on that. It's money. Turning money into more money is a common goal. 
As far as BTC being able to compete with more traditional forms of payment, the tech still has a ways to go. Any barely literate Joe can get and use a standard credit/debit card in nearly every store he walks in to. Bitcoin isn't that user friendly yet. 
Overall, I don't think the currency is dying. I'm seeing more people learning about it than ever before, more people joining the cryptocurrency subs, more media attention, and more people buying it. It's establishing a solid user base. We just need better implementation.
