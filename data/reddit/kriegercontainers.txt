Money has no value... except for the tax base that the government controls who backs it...
Imagine that the US had some kind of economic fallout. It is entirely possible that the government can raise taxes to pay for such a fallout. Those taxes can be as high as it can withstand. This occurred in Greece in the last decade or so. The government had to raise taxes and start austerity to pay for it's debts. Guess what? Greece's government isn't large enough to pay for it's debt and it's economy is nowhere near strong enough to deal with the costs. Without the EU the old Greek currency would have plummeted in value. The Euro got hit from this arrangement.
Suggesting that a fiat currency by the government is backed by nothing shows a deep misunderstanding in basic economics.

Did you massively edit your comment after posting it? Seems like it.


The value of it is regulated by public perception, which is inherently volatile. You are suggesting that Bitcoin has tons of value, but the transaction fee has gone from a few cents to a few dollars in a month. As those fees climb, the usability of bitcoin in the open market plummets. As a cryptocurrency, this aspect is unacceptable.
Nothing I say to you matters. You have jumped right on in and are riding the gravy train. Good luck to you sir and good day.

This will probably get buried, but I just applied. I build affordable housing to the most vulnerable in Houston, TX. The unique aspect of a charity that I would like to pitch is sustainability and growth.
The more money that I have, the more the charity will grow over time. We build houses, get paid by government agencies rental income, and then will build more with it. $1mil will build 10 homes today, but we will be able to build 1-2 more annually with that money.
Thanks again for the consideration and many thanks for donating to anyone. It's an incredible gift.

People who are incredibly aggressive, like yourself, are really annoying. You come off as some naive kid that really just wants to tell his parents how cool his new idea is. I'm out.

Nobody said snapchat is a bubble? [It's losing a shit ton of money every year.](
How long do you think it will take before snapchat realizes that the value it provides does not equate to the equity stockholders have paid? Next up you will tell me how facebook isn't a bubble. Then maybe we can talk about Myspace.
Bottom line is you are in a circle jerk and don't know anything about what you are talking about.

Lol. I'll leave you boys to the circle jerk. The real estate bubble can't die. It can go down in value, but houses can't become valueless. Tech companies can't die. They can drop in value, but we will always need technology!

I mean... none of those industries had bubbles. I don't think you know what a bubble actually is.

Do you want to know the definition of a bubble. I liked Bitcoin and I love the concept of cryptocurrency. What I don't love is people like you utilizing Bitcoin as a means to make tons of money for nothing. It's not a healthy thing for any product.

I don't mean to be rude, but did you ever hear of the 90's tech bubble? Nobody thought it would end. That's precisely why it ends. Then you get to the 08 real estate bubble. For real estate level of risk, returns were sky high. You couldn't lose. Then you did.
I hope you make tons of cash, but don't bet on it long term.
