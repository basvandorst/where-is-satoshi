Nice! Can't wait to have repeatable builds everywhere just like package PGP signing.

Yes, it has a PDF reader written in JS called PDF.js. It is used by other projects like ownCloud.

There was a recent Firefox exploit that used the PDF reader to read ~/.ssh and other private stuff. Browser sandbox is limited to plugins which I have uninstalled (Flash Java). The sandbox needs to be OS enforced like xdg-app and selinux.

What do you need to use a term8nal for?

Not Docker-like or Selinux-like right? Does it have something similar to xdg-app sandboxing? I want to be able to give or take permissions to and from each app. Please point me to some relevant links :D

Firefox had a PDF viewer exploit recently that read ~/.ssh. Sandboxing is pretty weak these days.

Bleah.... Windows.... :)

The OS should do the sandboxing like xdg-app sandboxing. Browsers sandbox Flash and Java which I have disabled :P Chrome and Firefox can read your /etc/shadows file on a non-selinux and non-xdg-app sandbox. There was an recent exploit in Firefox PDF reader that could read your ~/.ssh.

You can do all of these things with clicks. Ubuntu has a software center and for apps that are not in the software center there is usually a downloadable .DEB file, and you can install it just like on Windows.

Antivirus software are a sign that we have poor sandboxing for desktop applications on ALL modern operating systems :(
