Bitcoin is probably the worst example. As you implied, Bitcoin and its blockchain are essentially one and the same. That alone doesn't say anything about its worth, even though you seem to think it does.  The original implementation of Bitcoin was so unscalable that it was extremely unlikely to realize the dream that people had hoped for it. The number of transactions that could reasonably be processed in a period of time was a fraction of a fraction of what the current global payment processing systems is capable of.
Lightning network aims to address that problem, so perhaps someday the scalability factor will no longer be an issue. However, none of that matters if you can't use BTC to obtain the goods and services you want. Being the chicken and the egg is useless if everybody's eating pork. In that case, BTC and all of its technology has no inherent value, which is largely the current status today.
The BTC blockchain is a marvel in its elegance and simplicity, and certainly it allows for scenarios that can have value. But today, volatility, scalability and lack of acceptance undermine everyone of its supposed benefits, either as a currency or as a store of value. Since the Bitcoin blockchain is essentially the same thing as Bitcoin, the whole thing is currently impossible to value.

Your comment has to be ironic...
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:41:20
I mean, it is pretty worthless. What valuable function does bitcoin serve in this climate?
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:00:16
I don't think I implied I was planning to avoid the space. You guys can't really hold rational conversations, can you?
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:20:31
Your response makes no sense in the context of my comment. Did you mean to reply to me?

Would love to know who exactly you're referring to when you say "legacy payment services." Examples of companies?
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:32:40
Since when are assets adopted according to the quality of their origin story? And what about BTC is a "rare unit of value measurement?" The total number of satoshis is greater than the entire money supply of USD, even if you measured it in pennies.

In this post you're saying cryptos are like stocks, and in the other post you're saying it's money. Regardless of what it theoretically is, the way they're being used (traded) today is much more similar to how people approach stocks.
The difference is, each share you own in a company is an ownership stake in an entity with intrinsic value. Realistically, a company should not be trading at a lower value than its book value, as it could then be acquired and liquidated for a profit. For healthy companies, the market capitalization should be higher since it will reflect the present value of future earnings.
Crypto currently doesn't give you a claim to anything with intrinsic value. Additionally, you can barely spend it.
It also seems disingenuous to make blanket statements that the services provided via the blockchain necessitate a coin with value. As far as I know, this isn't the case for many (most?) cryptos. The advantages of the blockchain are only loosely related to the coin.
I would like to see someone here explain an example of a blockchain/crypto that requires a coin, and how it creates tangible value.

Bit of a non-sequitur there. My point is only that BTC and cryptos are not necessarily solving for all of the business issues these other companies address. Your statement doesn't teach anyone anything they don't already know, and the speed with which the revolution comes about (if it at all), depends entirely on those most fervent about it understanding that which they seek to replace.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:22:30
Haha, no problem.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:26:51
Why do you guys keep trotting out the "bitcoin is scarce" thing? There are more satoshis than there are USD in the money supply, measured in pennies.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:40:13
This is a good point. Market cap is simply current price multiplied by shares (or coins). All shares are multiplied by the same price (obviously), so if prices are going up, a share/coin is now worth more than the money put in to acquire it.

Did you read the comment he's replying to?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:37:04
Why is the cryptocurrency crowd co-opting terms like "correction" as if it has any meaning here? Is it an attempt to legitimize the perceived value pf BTC when in fact it's completely unknowable?
The stock market intends to value real companies selling real products and services. Each company's stock price reflects the perceived future value of their earnings; earnings which can be verified by their financial statements. At times, this perceived value can become inflated, hence a correction. But it won't go to zero, because the majority of companies will remain in business and continue to make things that generate real value.
BTC and many other coins (but especially BTC) have no way to arrive at any number approaching an intrinsic value. Talking about a correction is meaningless when you don't even know what the value could reasonably be.

Credit cards are not "your money." You're borrowing the issuer's money with a promise to pay it back. Debit card transactions are funded by your money.

Bitcoin is also being "printed" in the sense that new BTC are being mined, and will continue to be mined until 2140.
The number of cents in the US money supply is in the trillions, while the number of satoshis is in the quadrillions.
Even if we assume this is still "scarce", why is scarcity a good thing? There's a reason we moved off the gold standard.

Seems like most of the people here don't actually know what these companies do. These comments would make sense if all these payments companies did was collect tolls and provide no value in return, but in fact there are hundreds of companies like Global Payments out there, and the reason they can collect fees is because they provide services companies will pay for.
No doubt that some of these services would become obsolete if everyone is paying via a single universal cryptocurrency, but these companies do more than just move money from point A to point B.

Looks like this number is dramatically (entirely?) affected by the speculative trading frenzy, whether it's by the trading itself or by the purchase and sale of BTC when people are getting into/out of BTC. Someone can go ahead and explain the mechanism and what is or isn't included on the blockchain, but I'm sure that at least some stage of the trading process is accounted for as the BTC needs to get into and out of traders' wallets. As far as I understand, any time the wallet comes into play there should be a record on the blockchain.
The fact that the slope is still higher than before while simultaneously flattening out is probably due to people continuing to exit BTC at a heightened rate (leading to more volume than the quiet days) without a corresponding influx of new investors (leading to less volume than the craziest days).
I also can't see a logical reason why BTC transactions for productive purposes (buying/selling goods) would increase exponentially during a bull market. There could be some increase as people have more purchasing power, but actually making the transactions in BTC may not be the best way to do it. At best you would get the same benefit as cashing out to USD (if the price in BTC was pegged to fiat and fell as the value of BTC rose). At worst you would be throwing money away if the price in BTC stayed the same (resulting in the buyer giving away a more valuable BTC for the same good/service). Not to mention anyone who thinks BTC would keep rising should presumably keep holding, meaning their spending activity wouldn't pick up until the bull market ends.

Well, the stock market dropped another 5%... and BTC dropped 13%.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:49:03
This is why there are also transaction costs built in to BTC. Can BTC function properly today with transaction costs serving as the primary or only incentive? I don't know. I'm asking.

First off, my comment doesn't imply at all that there's nothing to worry about with the traditional financial system, only that BTC is riskier.
Before you make any argument that you or anyone else bought BTC at x (where x is lower than the price today), recognize that the only way BTC becomes worth anything is if many people adopt it over the long-term. So, let's look at what happened to the collective group of BTC holders.
Taking your perceived doomsday outcome (based solely on your imagination), which is a drop to 10,000, and comparing that to what BTC has already done (dropped from $20,000 to $7,000), the reality is that BTC has already crashed more than your prediction for the real market.
For anyone invested in BTC, they've lost an incredible amount of value in the past month. On top of that, they can't even spend BTC on anything useful, which means they may not have the luxury of holding much longer. 1 BTC may equal 1 BTC, but you can't hold it forever if you can't spend it on anything. 
Not a good look for BTC.
Also, on a percentage basis, there were drops in 2015 bigger than this for the stock market, so no idea where Chernobyl-mode is coming from.

Why doesn't Tether get mentioned except in Tether-specific threads? Maybe the demand that drove BTC past $10k (or $3k) wasn't real. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:03:04
Good info. Thanks. Can I infer from this that the mining community had reached something of an equilibrium earlier last year, and was underpowered during the bubble?
Trying to understand where the delays and higher fees came from.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:27:00
How would the BTC blockchain function if everyone stopped mining? And why (and how) would outsiders invest in BTC if it was non-functioning?
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:59:11
The hand on your watch that moves really slowly.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:07:34
Ok, but why was the price of BTC going up to begin with?
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:41:51
Is this where the first and second layer comes in? First layer (mining) economy and prevailing transaction fees are preserved, while a second layer generates more microtransactions and micro-fees through open channels that spread costs more effectively?
And without the second layer, solutions like increased block size would be necessary?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:20:49
Look like you guys got to settle that one quickly. Stock market down 5%; BTC down 13%.
