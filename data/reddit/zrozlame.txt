One day it will be 10x the price, so you only lost a fraction of what someone else will lose

Im trying to simplify it, they average it from transactions and there was a transaction that was very low value
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:12:16
Thats one off the list, only 7,586,080,505 to go!
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:02:06
Sell it to me!
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:22:08
I know a guy but he has a fee, i would reccomend trying yourself first
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:23:19
They average the price from sales/purchases (?) , someone sold one to a friend for a dollar or something like that perhaps

But 13,000 gbp ... Thats a week of btc growth minimum

Edit, self educated and figured out a good way to do it without a big ‘spread’ but I’m open to better routes. You guys are experts after all 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:42:42
Lol BBC, yeah no
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:40:48
No, what i mean is, the confidence in the currency is such that they think that and therefore by will of that effect, it will happen
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:41:52
I hope it's one hell of a course.

You aren’t an idiot, you saved yourself money. It will drop farther and then, probably, recover. Buy when it picks back up, at least that’s what I’m doing

The same thing happened before, many times. It’s “crashed” the “bubble had burst” and every time it’s bounced back exponentially. People have billions in crypto, if billionaires are holding crypto then it’s unlikely to fold.
When you think it’s recovered, it most likely has. It will likely start of from a big and positive event or news flash to do with crypto, such as it being welcomed onto a big platform on the news leading to a small rise and then a following of bandwaggon investments.
People will invest if they think it’s rising, and that’s will make it go up because it’s an entirely confidence based currency. People think they will make money and think it will continue rising, thus making it rise
