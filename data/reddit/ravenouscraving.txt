The only reason I don't run a node 24/7 is because it kills my performance - and that's on a high-end PC. It's ridiculous for my VoIP to not function properly, or for all my other programs to suffer performance decreases, just to run the node out of the goodness of my heart.

This is really exciting. If 3/4 have not heard of it, that means 25% of people have.
Also, new trends have an interesting phenomenon between early adoption and mainstream acceptance. Generally, new trends take roughly the same amount of time to go from 0-10% acceptance as it does to go from 10%-80/90%.
**If** this holds true, it means we're in the middle of a huge wave of acceptance!

"To the moon" is specifically about someone that has 1 bitcoin and will use 1 bitcoin to purchase a ride to the moon. It's not a set in stone number, but when the value of 1 bitcoin and the cost of a ticket to the moon converges.
