"Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter?
The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address."
Shouldn't you update this to v3.0.5 due to the vulnerability that was announced last week?

helios_01 held for 6 months. Please tell me more about what you think the price of bitcoin will do? You have no idea, just like the rest of us.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:43:04
congrats you made 70 $ not including fee
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:06:10
What's your hold up? Please give us your insight.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:06:43
when the time is right ledger will either announce they support or do not support said coin, until then you wait. if your btc is in a hardware wallet, you are doing it right.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:10:12
Anything can and will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:06:31
A healthy correction
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:50:39
Right now would be a good buy in price.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:58:48
yea super easy unplug and open the case, look for the hard drive ( google what they look like)unscrew another screw and unplug and dismount. Take note of the wires going in, there should be a power cable and a sata or data cable of some sort, you will then plug those identical cables back into the hard drive from another pc.
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:04:31
The state of your comment i just read makes me not want to take your advice. I can see why you stopped the "education" aspect of your computer engineering. Probally your smartest move yet.
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:02:22
Still in my wallet
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:36:32
I done died and lived again on BTC, huh
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:51:45
The stock market will crash, the housing market will crash, humanity will be wiped out and bitcoin will soar past ATH, its all a matter of when.

Back in the day to test if a gold coin was actually gold you would bite it to check the malleability. Some times they would get scammed with shitcoin nickel. Kinda like bcash

Perhaps you should post this in r/Venezuela and get their perspective on things. 
I have also been here since the beginning of btc and have watched it grow, the thing you are Jordan fail to realise about this "Market" is its not just a speculative market its about change and decentralization not just making money. There will be scams and people will be burned just like in all walks of life. Brainwashed? I just don't like it when people tell me what i can or can not do with my money, especially if they themselves do not fully understand anything about it. If i want to spend my money on hookers and blow i will indeed spend it on hookers and blow.

Investing with emotions can only get you so far. Take that spirit and apply it properly. Perhaps our time frames are drasticly different, to each their own.
@_date: 2018-08-31 07:42:28
Listen to the album

Yes the bitcoin core client, which had its name long before BHC forked in.
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:16:05
Thats also what i was saying when it hit 1000
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:57:42
Right on this makes me happy! Another win for BTC in my books. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:34:39

And still, Bitcoin doesn't care.
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:55:57
Ya... i just copy/pasted what google showed me. This question has come up so many time i gave up actually trying.
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:53:57
An event is about to take place on the Bitcoin network that only happens roughly every four years. The amount of new bitcoin created and earned by miners with each new block of transactions is about to be cut in half. ... When these sorts of changes in bitcoin's inflation rate take place, it's known as a halving event
Edit: I copied and pasted from google. Sue me. Next halving event ETA May 30th 2020
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:49:57
Yes, yes you can.

1. Havent heard about you guys yet. But I have now! 
2. I like the fact that you guys are just generally supporting the bitcoin movement. 
3. Not sure I like the layout of the website. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:30:26
Well when I click on which credit unions are supported.  It loads and brings me back to where I started.  And I tried to buy some bit coins from the quick buy option with Canadian dollars and it just says NaN. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 04:41:41
That was 115 years ago.  Bitcoin has Come a long way in its 6 year life span. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:23:20
Bitcoin doesn't care about your comfort.
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:32:36
You never heard of the double spend problem that came with the birth of the internet because it was a problem then and there was not a solution, hence the hype around bitcoin. What evidence do you have that says currency needs to be controlled by a government? Please explain i need evidence to justify your ideology.
Since the decoupling from the gold standard in 197, fiat is only 57 years old in america and on a world stage started in the 11th dynasty in china. Only to be fully adopted globally in the 20th century. Commodity money has such a vast history it is hard to pin point an exact date. You sir are naive as fuck.
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:17:49
Do you think its a coincident each central bank is privately owned? 
Ill let you win bud. You seem like a sheep and hopefully an old one at that. You are not worth my time, you add no value to this debate. Iv been in this space since 2012 and have disagreed with dumber people than yourself. Its over your head, i get it. Hope you didn't waste to much time on your reply.
@_date: 2018-12-25 03:59:14
Perhaps during the recession yes, but you know why bitcoin was invented right?
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:20:06
Now you just sound desperate. I never said anything about replacing fiat. My responce to you is weak because i just don't care enough about what YOU think. I, personally am doing just fine. Put your money where your mouth is and buy some treasury bonds. I don't care, good luck.
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:54:27
Solving the double spend problem is arguably more tangible than regular fiat. As cash becomes less convenient your money right now spends most of its time in limbo through the centralized financial system. Who really holds your money for you when shit hits the fan? That's solving a problem in my eyes, If you can't see that p2p is for the people and the shear fact the world is being digitized you'll be the one holding the bags IMO, i for one think you yourself seem a tad short sighted.

I have seen it before and I'll see it again. That's the one thing I've learned with trading. It doesn't really mean a thing and that's pretty much the point.
If it does, Hopefully it establishes a new healthy baseline and people stay interested.
