1) exchange fees lower than credit cards (until recently, so this is currently subject to protocol fixes...)
2) services exist that let you invoice in btc with immediate conversion to cash and no volatility exposure
3) transaction settlement in hours instead of days or weeks 
4) no chargebacks
5) no mandatory arbitration of disputes
6) street cred/you think it's neat

Intrinsic value includes perception of value. Gold and silver have value because humans say so. As long as there are people who believe that Bitcoin and blockchain have something to offer, it will have value. You make a markets to trade something, the thing has value. Bitcoin will never go to zero.

Can always delete price widgets, tracker apps, unfollow the sub a while and get back into other things you enjoy until it's off your mind. Can mitigate losses, or chuck everything onto a hardware wallet and forget about it. Either way, you can only move forward. I don't want to share how much I'm down, but if I can zen, anyone can. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:31:44
I predicted a drop below $10k, sold 3%, kept the rest because the tech is neat, the social experiment is appealing, and I think the long term could be worth the wait. I have trigger points for sales along the way, but will never sell all of them, just to see what happens. (That's an investment strategy, and y'all might want to write down what you think yours is.)
I don't need the money, and you have to play to win, right? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:03:56
Achieve crypto zen by pretending you don't own any. You will recognize zen when the price is merely an interesting fact. 
And again - if you aren't prepared to see 80% of value disappear overnight, and stay that low for years or forever, you bought more than you can afford to lose. A dip may not be a sale. Don't let the prospect of a discount open your wallet more than you should.

Dear everyone:
Hi. I've been in btc a while (2011). This feels unsustainable. This feels like December 9, 2013 and the no good very bad three and a half years that followed.
Past performance does not indicate future results. No one can predict prices. If this crashes, DO NOT PANIC SELL. DO NOT GUARANTEE YOUR LOSSES BY CONVERTING THEM TO CASH.* DO NOT ASSUME THE PRICE WILL KEEP GOING UP OR BUY MORE THAN YOU ARE WILLING TO SET ON FIRE.
This sub was a disaster after the 2013 crash. Please remember to grit your teeth and hodl. 
ETA: *This was to say that you won't be part of a recovery if you cash out before it happens, which, inconsistent to the rest of my post, presumes there will be a recovery. There may not be. If you can't stomach the possibility that you lose everything, you need to decide a trigger point you can live with, sell at that point, and not look back. And if you have never tried to unload during a crash, consider it a bank run and be prepared for no immediate confirmations, late bank deposits, etc. And no, tweeting coinbase won't make it get fixed faster. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:40:45

When you sell btc for cash, it's called "realization" of your gains (or losses). If you held the btc for less than a year, it's a short term capital gain taxed at your marginal tax rate. If you held longer than a year, it's long term capital gains taxed at 0, 15, or 20% depending on your income.
There are unsettled questions about how to decide which Bitcoin you are selling, what happens when you trade one crypto for another, etc. Keep *excellent* records, and hiring an accountant who knows what bitcoins are is a very good idea...

Thank you for picking at my point without being an asshole. That particular piece of advice is inconsistent with the rest that I gave. With the exception of the tax benefits of offsetting LTCG with LTCL, which are wasted if you sell off at a loss with no realized gains, withstanding unrealized losses only works if you believe in and can afford to bet on a long term recovery. 
It was an incomplete statement to discourage runs on the exchanges and get people thinking about the possibility of loss. But that needs to happen somehow, because this isn't going to be pretty.

No one has a crystal ball and past performance doesn't indicate future results. Don't buy more than you can afford to lose, and don't guarantee a loss by selling low after buying high.

I use  for historical data. You can export and copy/paste the table to Excel/Sheets pretty easily, although you might have to do it in several pieces depending on how many rows you get.
Eta, it broke $1000 for the first time in 2013, but crashed to $600ish and yo yoed for days, never getting back to the ATH and eventually settling around $500 by February. Didn't hit $1000 again until this year.

That's why everyone needs to remember it's only a loss on paper if you don't sell! I'm really hoping it doesn't crash for the sake of the newbies and the future.

40% crash over two days from around $1200, jumped again to near $1000 then dropped again to $500. Spent 2014 gradually reducing to $200 and didn't recover until this February. If you haven't experienced a 40-50% drop yet, remember you aren't a part of the recovery if you cash out in the crash...

I literally said btc is speculating. I'm not sure what your problem is here. I can appreciate the idea of a stop loss, but if you're in btc for the first time in 2017 and the thought of losing 90% of value overnight is nauseating, you bought too much. If you're aware of how this thing behaves and the threat it presents to the institutions that can kill it, you know you're speculating and will either sell when the gains are acceptable or you'll hold through a crash.

My husband's former boss said in January that it would hit $10k by the end of the year and we thought he was nuts.
We wanted to pull the trigger on a few coins at $10k, but now I'm not sure, especially with futures trading starting next week.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:40:34
Perhaps you missed my first comment where I regurgitated the financial adage "past performance does not indicate future results" and "do not assume the price will keep going up," but yeah, I'm aware it won't necessarily recover. But if you lose value and sell with no gains from other assets to offset it, you're wasting the equivalent of a tax deduction, and if it happens to come back from, I don't know, say $200 to $17,000 in 16 months or so, you won't be a part of it.
Btc is speculating, pure and simple. If you can't hold in a crash, you bought more than you could afford.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:22:57
Irs guidance from 2014 - if held for investment less than one year, gains taxed as short term capital gains at your marginal rate. More than one year, at the long term capital gains rate, which will be 0, 15%, 20%, or another that I forget based on your bracket.

@_date: 2017-12-08 03:24:41
No, but that's why I was trying to bring up old bad times as a reality check and warn against panicking. I'm very concerned about the newbies because they think a +/-10% swing in a day is volatile. People are going to lose their shirts, so if they can't handle that idea, they should get out while they have some kind of ROI.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:17:24
FDIC is per depositor per bank, so if there's a joint account with a spouse (or anyone, for that matter), it's insured to $500k, so would be covered with two accounts. And that only matters if the bank fails, which doesn't really happen anymore, they just get bought out.

So you would encourage people to sell when it bottoms out? Do you know how many people lost out on the economic "recovery" of the last ten years because they panicked in 2008 and cashed out what was left of their 401(k)s? If you sell the asset, you aren't there if it recovers. You don't record a capital loss if you haven't disposed of the asset. But please, continue to insult me because you disagree. It's charming.

It's your marginal rate on ordinary income for short term capital gains, not 39.6. That's the top rate (for 2017; 2018 tops out at 37%), but if you're in the 25% bracket STCG are taxed at 25%.
And LTCG can be 0%, 15%, or 20%, subject to whatever changes Dear Leader's tax bill made.
