We kinda have this already,... I mean there is Xbox credit/points, WoW gold, Rocket League keys,... Sure, they will now expand on it (maybe make M$ coin work for Windows, Xbox and cloud offerings instead of each having their own) but sooner or later people will get fed up with so many options or wallets will automatically choose to hold the best currency and spend the worst where possible. In the end the best will persist and I think it is not some corporate coin.

Where I live the government made a virtual "shopping basket" to measure inflation... Of course it is heavily skewed in favor of consumer goods that mask inflation like you said (but very few notice that). If they were honest, they would not compare it to consumer goods but to real hard assets where the supply doesn't change so easily like: land and human time (wages). But sure, lets compare the price of bread, where someone put their muscles into it 100 years ago and now a machine spitts out 100/second. And celebrate that it is still $2!

You might get lucky when you play the lottery, but if you follow crypto for years, read white papers, watch or attend multi day conferences, set up nodes &amp; wallets and decide to invest a significant amount of your money in full knowledge of it might tank more than 80% tommorow, you know what you are doing.

Why "we" need 2% inflation? It's so you have to keep working. We don't need it but our leaders need it to keep the people in check. "But, but, but: I heard we NEED some inflation, otherwise nobody will buy today, because you will get a better deal tomorrow!" Reality paints a very different picture. Some markets are deflationary by nature, see electronics / tech, you always get more for less next year but stuff still sells... And not just barely; the most valuable companies are in the tech / electronics business. It's not just food, people will continue to buy in a deflationary environment, they will continue to spend, even on luxuries, see e.g. Apple.
@_date: 2019-08-16 13:55:32
2. People have been told by government or school, that "we need some inflation, because during a deflation nobody would buy today, if you can get more for less tomorrow or next year". But, I don't think this is true at all. Inflation is a tool designed to keep you working for as long as possible by making it difficult / impossible to save for the long term. We already have examples of deflationary markets / industries, that work out very well, despite their nature. For example: why would you buy a TV, computer, phone,... Today when you can get a better one next year or get this one 30% cheaper? Yet people still buy - and not just the basics, but luxuries, see apple, they are among the most valuable / profitable companies out there!
4. We can just "add more digits" once the current lowest number (1/100 000 000th of BTC) becomes too valuable.

A good way to ensure that no errors were made when copying (or writing it down) is to re-generate the wallet using the copied (or written) seed. If this is successful you can sleep at night, knowing no error was made. Alternatively one can take a picture of the seed (obviously using a "dumb" camera, not one connected to the internet, like a phone), now all you need to do is check, that the whole seed was captured &amp; isn't blurry. Obviously backups and maybe encryption is needed for storing seeds like this, but this will help avoiding errors when copying.

I always find these "ultra optimistic predictions" very interesting, not because they go too far but because they don't go far enough! Ok, ok, first Bitcoin would have to replace all Dollar, all fiat or even all debt, however: if it does, it's ultimate value will be way, way higher because fiat is not desired by the wealthy and can be created "on demand". Why is fiat not desired you may ask: when we look what kind of assets the wealthy own, we see that 90%+ (some statistics say up to 97% for the most wealthy) is in stocks, property, art and so on and only what is immediately needed is changed to fiat. Also: when you need money, your bank will just create it and ask for interest, if we fully convert to Bitcoin, one can not simply create more when it is needed, therefore it will need to be valued way higher to provide the needed liquidity.

Rant alert: I HATE the "use 2 factor authentication" part of it. One point on that infographic was "remove your crypto from exchanges" if you have done that then two factor authentication should be a moot point. Also: there is "good" (read: somewhat meaningful / decent) 2FA but there are many bad and poor implementations (especially the ones where you get an SMS; the scammer will just call your phone network provider and will use basics social engineering to get access). So,... Good passwords and good password practice is better than average 2FA IMO. People will not believe it, but flipping a coin 160 times beats 2FA.

I agree. Bitcoin currently has a lot going for it: The oldest crpto, the biggest market cap and the biggest brand recognition (by far!). And while almost all of this can change, you can not create an older coin (except you also invent the time machine, of course). And all these discussions about Bitcoin being old, slow and outdated and it is only a matter of time before some alt will replace it, because Bitcoin is not innovative enough: dream on, I say. Bitcoin has not yet succeeded, it has not become boring, fiat is still dominant. Bitcoin is still in it's infancy, changing and evolving at break neck speed. Just go back a few years: did you run a Bitcoin wallet on your phone? How long do you know about Lightning? What do you think will happen when Lightning matured for a couple of years (AMP, Channel factories, watch towers and such implemented in most wallets)? There is just so much exciting things going on. And because Bitcoin is the biggest, it will see the most work being done on it.

Where I life we had negative interest rates for more than 2 years now. Although everything on the surface seems fine ("1st world country", almost no unemployment, etc.), I am sure this is not actually the case. It is used to mask massive economic problems. Now, the central bank has manovered itself in a strange spot without the option to lower interest rates should there be a need (and if you ask me, they should raise interest rates now, especially since we have good employment, but who am I to suggest such a thing). Currently the only visible effect is, that it crushes the  business model of the domestic banks, since their customers still expect a small amount of interest (or at least be able to have a savings account for free) on their savings. However, banks can no longer provide that. Now they have already pushed negative interest on to their very wealthy customers (&gt;1mio.) But many are thinking about pushing it onto all their customers and this will end badly.  Most folks here don't care when their bank only gave them 1% when inflation was 2%, because most don't understand. However, if you start charging negative interest, people will stuff their savings in their mattress (as dumb / unsafe it sounds/is). So, this is poison for a banking system dependant on fractional reserve to operate.
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:29:53
Thank you for sharing this. I just read it and it is an interesting insight, especially in regards to fees. While their conclusion is rather broad and touches on wider implications of Bitcoin, their focus was on fees, it's effect on priority, congestion and deployed infrastructure (and its cost). I think their most interesting/controversial conclusion in this regard is: there is a need for some congestion, otherwise people will not pay fees and fees are important to miners (especially once new coins are no longer generated). They also see a potential future where people do not pay fees but some miners will continue to provide service at a loss due to them having a large stake in Bitcoin. While I agree on all these points (but think this is a problem for future me (aren't humans great at transferring problems to the next generation?!?)), I was hoping to read a bit more into the difference between a traditional monopolist and Bitcoin. Overall I don't think we can make a conclusion about whether banks "get it" or not. Or at least not in general. They certainly understand some aspects better than others and certainly not all banks are on the same knowledge level. But I now think it is not the relevant question to ask, because it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter for the banks and certainly not for Bitcoin. Why doesn't it matter for banks you may ask: a bank can sell you something it does not completely understand. They already do this, for example: gold. A bank doesn't need to know the atomic weight or the conductivity of gold, because it is not relevant to them. They only need to care about a subset of its properties, like scarcity, authenticity (sure conductivity might help here, but they could relay on a third party to verify that) and durability. Therefore I think banks are best advised to get in (with getting in I mean providing services people would value) early and don't try to fight it - I think most banks have realized that and in the end this is all that matters.

I think it is very interesting to research previous attempts to create "digital / electronic cash". All of them failed, most of them because they were declared illegal sooner or later. Obviously all of them were different to Bitcoin (or better said: Bitcoin is different than them, at least technically). I don't think that governments will see much success in banning Bitcoin, but I do think it is interesting to not see more attempts. Why do you think that is? Why don't we see more attempts to stop it? Is Bitcoin not big enough to be perceived as a threat? Do governments and central banks not understand the threat it poses to them? Do they think the best course to destroy it is to not mention it? Do they "get" it and already think  "can't beat them better join them"? Don't get me wrong, I see crypto as a gigantic chance for the financial liberation of humanity, but I also see it as a huge threat to the establishment.

People always complain, that we are "only" seeing 60% Segwit transactions, however I am going to make the argument that this is already quite high. Hear me out: Segwit transactions are a bit smaller (by how much depends on a lot of things, and depending on that you save anywhere between 10-75% on transaction fees, based on my research). This is a big enough saving for routine usage (large exchanges), however for the average user, the main driver for fees is the network congestion &amp; "value" of BTC (if one complains about fees, they usually complain because they did the maths to fiat). Saving 10-75% on a 50cent fee is not enough for most to create a new address, maybe using a different wallet software for this, doing research,... While I think Segwit is nice, and will pay attention to that when creating new wallets, it is not worth it for me to move all my BTC to new wallets. Additionally it doesn't help, that when you google "Bitcoin address generator" the first results generates legacy addresses, has no option to change that and doesn't even mention Segwit. I only figured out how to tell the difference between the two, like a month ago. So, to wrap it all up: I think 60% is amazing for what "little" Segwit offers - think about how much more Lightning offers (like &gt;99% fee reduction and speed increase), if we get similar or faster adoption there things will move forward by a lot.

Oh, we will see more events like this. Traditional banks have adapted their services to "also run" on the internet. Where as Bitcoin runs natively on the internet. This means Bitcoin was designed to be resiliant against attacks, stores no personal information about you, and so on. Banks keep on patching their ancient systems, and certainly none of them trust their own stuff enough to be able to make such a bold statement as Bitcoin can (Bitcoin's statement to me means: "come at me, bro! Try to hack me, try to DDOS me! Give me your best shot, I am sure you will fail!").

I think it is very interesting to see the evolution of use cases when it comes to Bitcoin. At first (many years ago) Bitcoin was so new and untrusted people would only buy the needed amount of BTC to make the purchase they ultimately wanted (e.g. drugs). After it being around for a couple of years people started to mostly use it for financial speculation. I think we might have seen peak speculation (doesn't have to mean peak price) end of 2017, where I'd say most people were in it for this reason. Now, I think we are at the start of the transition to store of value (I define speculation as "hope to make more in the future" and store of value as " I fear my local currency might inflate and I need a safe harbor for my money"). I think everyday usage (for payments) can only start again (in significant amounts) once the transition to store of value is complete. Once we have transitioned from speculation to store of value, we should see much more stability when it comes to purchasing power.

The fees are also very high due to rapid expansion. A company that charges a 10% fee can buy the next ATM (at least!) 5 times faster than a competitor who only charges a 2% fee.

Of course! Crypto will succeed where banking fails. I am swiss, and while I am excited about crypto, it is currently nowhere close to be competitive against traditional banking here. But this is only because I have a lot of options with traditional banking and a relative secure environment. Thus (for me) fiat is rather safe, accepted everywhere, low fees and little inflation. However, this is not the case everywhere (by a long shot!). We will see emerging markets leapfrog traditional banking as we have seen asian and African countries skipping wired phones and going straight to cell phones. The incentives for them are just much larger.

The crazy thing IMO is not the amount itself. The crazy thing is that no "normal joe" received any of it. It all went to the guys with full pockets. There was a time where the US sent dollars directly to their citiziens to stimulate the economy. Guess what happened? It worked "too good" people when to shops and spent it all! Nowadays they just give it to the rich, they don't spend it, they just use it to create more debt to loan out to the little guys. This is why interest rates are so low (or even negative) in the EU. Yet there is still no growth and won't be anymore because we are at the "end" of capitalism, where inequality is so great most people have given up.

What I am trying to say is: (I know, I know: never say never) this is very, very unlikely to happen. Someone will always stay online and continue to mine. And as Bitcoin continues to succeed, it gets even more unlikely. The first days of Bitcoin were rough: the first Block took days to mine!

IMO 5G will be a major contributor to the success of Crypto. I think we will need at least (my most optimistic view) a couple of years to really take off. 5G starts to roll out in 1st world today,... First crazy expensive smartphones with 1TB storage are released this year. In 2-3 years 1TB of storage will be normal for sub $200 phones. People will have cheap and unlimited plans because 5G has so much more bandwidth. This will enable people to run everything on their phones with ease. When this happens it's gonna ��

Back in these days I bought parts for a new PC, including an Ati 4870 X2 (the fastest GPU at the time). Built the PC, thought I'll give the GPU a good workout by mining some BTC (GPU mining was a new thing). Downloaded the software, learned I need to join a pool, lost interest and never mined any. Came pretty close to mine some, oh well.

It's not a dumb question at all! Every citizen should know or ask. The debt is created when the treasury and the fed get together and do "their thing". The federal reserve creates money out of nothing and hands it over to the treasury. The treasury in turn pays the fed interest. This interest is ultimately paid by the taxpayer. We pay interest to a private bank for lending money to the government.

People invent a system for money which is entirely censorship free, pure maths, total self control, no registration or ID required anywhere, but then people CHOOSE to subject themselves under such censorship by inviting 3rd parties to control their money.

As someone who just recently joined the Bitcoin community (watched it from the fence for 1.5 years, but only this week bought a small amount) I can wholeheartedly agree. I'd like to add, that the whole Bitcoin Cash thing made me more conservative with jumping in, but this can be seen both positive and negative: sure, the whole FUD/shill shows tarnished the Bitcoin brand, but on the other hand it forced me to really inform myself about the differences and make an educated decision. On the bright side: people take note and learn from the past (the one's who don't will have a worthless shitcoin on their hands and will leave the market this way). However this is hardly the last fork we will see - as long as people keep falling for it, there is money to be made. Not saying all forks will be or are scams, technically the people forking could be "right" and make a better decision, but fail to communicate / convince the majority and only "win" in the long term,... But history and common sense tells me otherwise: if you can't convince the majority of a group, you better swallow your pride and realize that your idea was not the best. And smart people do; they will rethink their idea, take criticism serious and improve upon.

As much as I respect Andreas, I too think he is grossly underestimating the lengths a large nation state could go to undermine Bitcoin if it was determined to so. Think about the race to the atomic bomb. The US employed many thousands of top engineers and scientists, built entire cities in secret and used up to 10% of the nation's energy to do so. Sure, there is currently no need or interest to go so far, but when it comes down to "us or them" do not underestimate the lengths somebody will go through. I think it is naive to say "we are safe" when all it takes is "convincing" 2 or 3 large miners. A nation has many options for convincing somebody, be it moral or not, use of force, public harassment, threats, against the miner or it's family and friends.

Bitcoin could also have been used as the ultimate tracking tool for a corrupt government. Imagine declaring your BTC address at the US border. What you should have had access to is something like monero. Sadly few people understand this.

If it were possible for an exchange to get up one morning and to decide to simply "do a reorg" to get the funds back, Bitcoin would be a failure. Bitcoins were stolen, this sucks, but there is nothing one can do afterwards. One can only secure in advance.

Not sure if you are trolling, but in general I am pro free market too but some kind of stuff certain players in the crypto world tried to pull off (or did pull off) was not only sketchy af, but borderline illegal. I am thinking about ICOs raising the coin cap after ICO started, "stable" coins saying they store every fiat dollar but refuse to have it audited,... Sure, you can always sue later but the people, corporations and the money is probably long gone.

I mean he is not wrong. With the current solution and block size it is practically impossible to onboard everyone to LN. So it is a temporary solution to continue to scale, maybe 100 - 1000x but not the final. However on chain scaling alone won't solve the problem either (and assuming Moore's "law" will hold up another 40 years,... I don't know, to me that too is a big IF). To me it seams, that both scaling solutions (and maybe additional ones that have yet to be invented / implemented) are needed to succeed, however it is difficult to convince people that it is needed when there is no urgent and pressing need.

Lol, same here. Just got a Ati 4870X2 (the fastest dual GPU at the time). Heard that Bitcoin is now minable on GPUs, read some more, people said you run calculations but don't know what exactly. So I thought it must be providing compute or network power for criminal acts. Downloaded all the tools but never tried them,...

If you own your coins on chain, then you only have to trust Bitcoin and yourself. If you leave them in the hands of someone else, then you have to trust this entity in ADDITION. Don't see how people think it is safer to leave funds at exchanges.

People have phones and they are locked with PINs, password, finger print or face. If you forget your stuff and can't get in you are out of luck. Sure you can wipe and setup new, but most people don't have to because they learned how it works. In the beginning it will be hard for some but tools will be made available to make it easier. Many wallets today already support fingerprint to unlock. And honestly: it's 2018 if you haven't figured out how to remember your banking password and have to call your bank everytime you log in, then you deserve to be robbed.

Lightning will make Bitcoin actually useable for average Joe's on a global scale for the first time in history. We are just at the very beginning of Bitcoin. Once Lightning wallets and point of sale systems are common place almost nobody will make on chain payments anymore. Give it a few years. Progress in crypto is breathtaking when compared to traditional banking. Traditional banking  will soon be left in the dust before people realize.

Sure, there are always people who don't trust themselves or have no place to store their keys securely. I mean, you need to encrypt them and store in multiple locations to be safe. And for this you need to have some knowledge (choosing encryption method and password) as well as at least 2 somewhat safe locations (maybe your home and work or parents place). Not everyone has this, but for people who have this, I think it is much safer to be the only person with access.
