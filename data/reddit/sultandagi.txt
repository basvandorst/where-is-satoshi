Unlike many people here, you shouldn't trade with HODL mentality because you'll loose money at the end. HODL has zero science in it. These fools just want to believe bitcoin will skyrocket and they will be rich and have lambos with zero knowledge of statistics, trading or finance. They won't even know why bitcoin has so much value at the moment. All they will say is 'oh it is the future, it is decentralized, it is the digital gold' and bla bla bla, basically total bullshit. Learn trading, learn to read the charts, look at the fx first then come back to coin world. You'll how fast this unregulated world can fluctuate and how whales can manipulate it. Anyone who is saying price will go down will be down voted because it is against these fools' dreams.

I dont hate bitcoin, I own it indeed. First of all all the reasonings listed in that article pure stupidity.
1- LIMITED TO 21 MILLION BITCOINS - So what? Why would being limited number makes something even valuable?
2- FOMO OR FEAR OF MISSING OUT - This wouldn't add any value to it at all. It is just a price pump effect.
3- LOST KEYS - How the f... this would even effect the valuation?
4-LARGE INVESTMENT FIRMS LEND CREDIBILITY - CBOE and CME will only decrease the price they will never pump it up. It is not how futures really work.
5- HARDER AND COSTLIER TO MINE THEM - Just because you have to pay more electricity bill and hardware you are buying doesn't ever make something valuable. The mining of a bitcoin doesnt fucking solve any real world problem. it just consumes electricity!
And I could disprove also other points wrong. I just wanna warn innocent people to get their mind off from getting rich just by investing some stupid '...coin'. Go and check greater fool theory.

I did withdrawal on december 21, it was quite an amount and didn't have any problem. It showed up in my bank account on 27th dec.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:23:17
screen shot or didnt happen!
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:07:51
Considering bitcoin came out in 2009, your neighbor is a fucking liar!
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:26:18
All I can say is get ready for a drop till 5800$, no kidding!
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:33:34
i can count 1000 reasons why it wouldn't. Go ahead and down vote me :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:07:42
this is what scares me the most indeed! It feels basically like 'California Gold Rush'
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:15:29
good for you, here is your cookie.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:26:41
see you at 2000
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:09:04
Total crap content, the guy has no clue how futures even work.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:36:12
if this happens it is "jump ship" time boys, trust me!
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:37:17
wait for now, it is very shaky ground at the moment and plus news from south korea planning to ban is not a good sign at all!
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:31:46
because they also bet 2mil that bitcoin will be down to 2k
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:39:19
guys i totally agree with this, please be careful, the current rise of the price can not be explained with any known formula
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:11:31
it might shrink about 61%
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:38:59
pump at the moment, dump will come for sure
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:19:51
These are pretty valid points indeed!
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:18:03
i hope it just continues this way and it is not a temporary pump!
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:23:06
And you just registered to post this story?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:34:43
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:13:56
your son may even see btc at 2K
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:18:04
good luck with that knowledge
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:47:50
I know many of fellow HODLers will not like that page, but what is written is true I believe
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:18:23
and gdax is down once again
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:10:05
ok boys some big shit is going on!
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:50:36
you just cannot open an account in German bank if you are not resident of Germany but you my try of course.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:57:15
wtf is happening!
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:47:31
Well I didn't say that I am not gonna buy again :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:48:31
I tried with different VPNs but no luck!
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:27:20
Spoiler alert: The guy on the street is part of CNBC crew to pull the price down before CME joins to the market.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:23:39
For mac I can offer BarBar to be placed in your status bar so gdax price is always there with you!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:49:13
and each bitcoin is 100.000.000 satoshis, do you see where i am going with this?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:13:16
I dont get why people expect a pull back at 10K!
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:17:13
BTC is about to strike back, fasten your seat belts!
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:18:07
Very good indeed and the video also!
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:12:52
yeah definitely that is gonna happen no doubt :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:31:08
check the 4chan, lots of ideas flying around there. But you know, it is like everyone has a different opinion. it might be like this or it might be like that...
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:20:26
flash crash just happened
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:11:57
Good act before CME goes in to the market to drop the price, well played CNBC.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:16:50
and this means?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:50:57
dipping at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:43:33
go to gdax which is basically coinbase and buy with 0% fee.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:54:44
i've seen that too wtf happened on that moment i got no idea!
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:52:52
I'm very suspicious about all what is going on! So many bots commenting on reddit at the moment for the promotion of bitcoin and gdax I guess more than 50% is managed via bots.
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:59:19
Holly fuck! How much did you invest in bitcoin? Because their commission is at aroung 1.49% as far as I know. If they charged you €7050 then I believe you've just invested in a fortune!
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:45:53
Forget about mining, just buy via some exchange websites. It will be 100K before you figure it all out!
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:31:32
what if there was total loss of faith in dollar or euro or go(l)d? Collective belief creates a value, when it is gone the value is gone.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:49:05
Buy and HODL
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:03:21
I'm very skeptical about this CME joining the game stuff. The current price of BTC is high and as expected everyone would like to get it cheap and I have doubts about bringing those big players in this village. They may try to build a city and first they have to destroy the village!
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:32:54
I dont see no dip!
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:24:40
Actually I've already sold my 3 bitcon at ATH and I got nothing at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:03:09
This is indeed a great read. Shows the real facts and dark side of the blindly investment and it doesnt actually says to HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:17:13
this is what i call a true flash crash
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:05:13
you don't have to buy it all at once, bitcoin can be divided to 100.000.000 smaller parts, get one of those!
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:35:27
"Only when the last tree has been cut down, the last fish been caught, and the last stream poisoned, will we realize we cannot eat money"
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:19:32
Yep for sure, but that might happen at any second, just thinking it will be at 10K doesn't make sense to me but whatever!
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:36:16
and you have no BTC in return?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:34:45
Yep I also saw some pretty big gaps over there, don't know wtf is going on! This just feels too artificial.
