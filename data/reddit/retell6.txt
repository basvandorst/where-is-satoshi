For when you can’t HODL it anymore

It does not a actually cost 10 times more. There is a slight premium over making regular payments to a purchased new car, and you have to watch out for their hidden fees. However, if you own your own business you can write 100% of the payments and fees off as a business expense.  But it doesn’t make as much sense to lease as an individual unless you are wealthy and/or absolutely need to have a new car every 3 years for whatever reason. There is also the added bonus of maintenance of the vehicle.
Best bet as an individual would probably be to buy a used car about 2-3 years old. But also, the value of the vehicle will depend on variables like how long it will last versus the retained market value and reliability of a car, and will vary amongst the different manufacturers as well.

No one ever mentions the energy war we’ve been in for the last decade. One of the main reasons why Russia and Iran are pissed at us.

Yeah but they’re limited in their sales bc of sanctions, and therefore they have been losing billions in foreign sales.

Wow everyone reads way in between the lines. It’s what I said, it’s all I said, and in no way implied the suggestion I made was the only way.

To truly spread adoption you should have a pamphlet explaining crypto’s to your passengers. Asking for tips from ppl who already have wallets isn’t really spreading the word I don’t think. Now if you offered to give them a dollar in any of those currencies, it would force them to start a wallet and that would be spreading the adoption.

You missed my point completely

Every idea is dumb until you get enough people to think it’s smart, and most people are too afraid to decide for themselves so they wait for others’ opinions.  It’s all about consensus. Will digital currency be the future? Yes! Just look at all the corporate entities racing to digitize their monetary transfers or coming up with their own crypto’s altogether since the crypto craze happened. Will it be Bitcoin? Who knows, but everyone has the power to make it so, they just have to agree upon it.
The biggest problem with Bitcoin is that even the purists can’t decide on what they want. They say they want bitcoin to be a stable store of wealth, but at the same time are hoping for a 10-30x bull run to make them rich overnight.  How do those two ideas correlate?

If you really wanted to buy that much you should probably already have someone you’re paying for investment advice and services. They could probably tell you.
Edit- if they don’t know, hire someone new

If wallets were really that simple there’d be more adoption
