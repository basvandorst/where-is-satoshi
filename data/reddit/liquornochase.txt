I just want to say that black is sexy as hell and I wish app developers would utilize it more.  Good stuff

Satellites aren't miners.  They only let you run a node without internet

Without permissionless electricity mining like this would be difficult to achieve.  i'm not saying it can't be done, but if you're using the electricity on the grid, it'd be too easy to locate mining operations if you're a government.

"Virtual currency" is a loaded term.  They probably mean that to be some future centralized bank backed PoS and not bitcoin

Its a delicate balance.  I probably would be in agreement with you if it weren't for the happenstance that some of the big rich bosses are tech entrepreneurs and futurists and not guys who would rather stagnate progression for their own personal wealth.  We are fortunate that this is the case right now.

To be honest the government is pretty swell at doing that too.  Private industry is better for some things because politics don't get in the way.  Especially if your CEO is a billionaire visionary.  We would not have any of this if NASA was tasked with it

There is competition to think about.  Of course, Elon wants HIS company to be remembered for X/Y/Z.  Not Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin or Richard Bransons Virgin

I actually had the hashtag in there but took it out because I thought it was too much.  Wait that dumb bot remove my post?

I actually like this design.  I'm thinking maybe I should have the top and bottom halves faded and make them converge 100% brightness into the middle...I'm using Helvetica series btw..
It's on amazon merch here if you want to see it in different colors

A bit coin bank maybe.  Though that does ruin the prospect
