I actually don't really have a problem with it, but I find it really amusing how polarizing it is.

Some things wrong with your statement, first is gold was set as a standard because it has an actual physical limitation of existence while bitcoin has a digital limitation - anyone who controls 51% of Bitcoin processing can ruin it for everyone which is not the same as gold. Second, gold has uses beyond contact plating that are easy to Google. Third, gold's value has been distorted by contracts, but not anywhere near 1% of market value even in terms of only a raw material for manufacturing purposes. 
Edit: *processing*

Link to a paper for that? And renewable or not, it currently takes the power consumed by about 5 houses a day to process one transaction, which is absolutely absurd at any kind of scale.

"As Cointelegraph [reported]( in May, [Canadian](  bitcoin mining company Hut 8 made almost $50 million in revenue last  year but triggered total losses of almost $140 million. The company’s  chief operating officer Andrew Kiguel noted at the time that he believes  margins will improve if BTC’s price continues to rise."
So it's:
1. Still wildly inefficient to be able to handle a small percentage of the tens of millions of daily electronic transactions which happen in the United States, because renewable or not, we'd consume all of the worlds available power to process a handful of today's transactions.
2. Still unprofitable and requires Bitcoin to continue increasing in price, which will mean more transactions, which means... see how unsustainable this is? All of the fan-boying in the world will not resolve the core technical challenge.

"[each Bitcoin transaction consumes 250kWh, enough to power homes for nine day](   
You got some alternative facts for me?
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:24:33
Or, and hear me out, it's an actual problem which needs solutions. Most of the people promoting it aren't working on how to make it sustainable, it is currently not.  If you really believe in Bit/Altcoin and its potential then you need acknowledge the weaknesses and work on preventing them at scale. Otherwise, you risk a lot of adapters having transactions that can't reconcile which then causes a pendulum shift in people dropped it en masse to use something that actually works. You can have the best MMO on the planet but if it's on shit servers with problems people will bail and lose trust. You can't write off all criticism as jealous, that's hubris.

Every now and then I would see an article in my feed about a 'total meltdown' or some other inflammatory commentary, and about once a week would bite, check the price, then ban that news source from my feed when I saw it was bullshit.

Good god that's all a bunch of tripe. Banks don't print money, period, and they do loan out the maximum amount dictated by the reserve ratio because otherwise the money sitting in excess is just losing value to inflation.   
Just because you don't understand inflation does not mean others do not, and [we know plenty of things to do about it]( but it's a matter of if that's the best thing for society to be enacted usually through policy.   
Adam Smith's writings are referenced in economics all the time and he used moral philosophy to discuss how bad actors (the selfish who would horde money) would self regulate in a competitive economy which we've seen work with proper regulatory controls in place which *are not* in place now.   
That's all the free econ tutoring I'm willing to provide today. Go sign up for a class, there are plethora of sources available to educate yourself.

I'll jump because I'm a car guy. Lamborghini is hands down one of the most impressive manufacturers of both cars and engineering materials. If you go look at their car museums, Lambo makes Ferrari look like dog shit. It's like judging Porsche because you see more Boxters than GT3s, just because most people are running around with shitty Gallardos does not mean the manufacturer is 'overrated'.

I usually skip commenting on most of the circle jerking in this sub but this is so blindingly ignorant. Let's skip over how most of the country not having internet access, most people not having any money in the first place (commodity/true socialism-ticket-goods systems), or having any ability to convert fiat to any digital platform. If there was any regular use of an alternate currency they could just as easily detain, torture, stingray, et all to get access to your digital currency.

First, [the bill has not passed the house]( Second, I'm not trying to crap on this as an accomplishment for utilizing BTC, but the government also [lets you pay taxes on your illegal drugs and stolen goods]( so I think it's healthfully skeptical to think this may just be a trick to catch people who weren't reporting their crypo purchases.

While I generally hate the circlejerk around Crypo Lambos, if this guy got that with 9BTC it means he got them out well above 15 and obviously that was a much better value store than holding.

There are many free econ classes online, this post is bullshit freethought that will never advance the legitimate use of crypto currency or technology, and if you can't be smarter than this then you won't either. Nonsense like this weighs down the community and dilutes the conversation, it does not make it better.

If you want to custom order one, yes, but a lot of companies are like that even Porsche and including Lamborghini. If you want a brand new GTB that's on the floor you can walk in with cash and get it.
