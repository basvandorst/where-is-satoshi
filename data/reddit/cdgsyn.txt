It's called having 7 years of crypto experience..... I'm still here. I'm doing something right.

I'm very grateful that I made money. Yes, the whales used to get me often but I have been trading since 2012. With experience comes knowledge of how to use the whales to your advantage. I have very little money in crypto atm. I'm just now starting to get serious about it again.

I feel like BTC is going to correct well below 10k before we see an upsurge again. Look at past trends.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:08:40
There will be plenty of opportunities to get it back ��. You win some and you lose some haha.

Nobody can predict the future but as long as the USA is the technology leader of the world we will remain on top. I do predict China will grow simply from the fact that they have newer and more state of the art assembly lines than any other country in the world right now. The EU is too fractured both politically and economically to be a threat. Probably at least for the next 20-30 years.  
When the US pretty much blacklisted Huawei, a giant worldwide manufacturer, they came out and admitted in so many ways that it severely hurt their company. 
Politically I'm an independent, I see the pros and cons of both Dems and Republicans. (There are pros on both sides), but Trump taunting China will only pressure them into designing more advanced technology and will grow increasingly independent from us. I do believe Xi wants China to grow but I don't get the impression he is a person that desires to start a major conflict with the US as he seems to be more level headed and calculated than our president.

And we all know how well Mark Zuckerberg respects boundaries. I have thought about this too not only the scrutiny from the US but if Facebook screws up we could have the entire world trying to crush crypto. All they have to do is regulate the exchanges out of existence and we are done. Plus with Facebook already under regulatory scrutiny it would only add major insult to injury.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:50:54
That is true but the general public will see it as being in the same basket because crypto is an alien concept to them.

It depends on the market. In a slow market bouncing back and forwarth between a certain % works. It gets more dangerous the more volatile it gets. This current market is dangerous for everyone.

I think FOMO has finally started. Keep on ripping y'all. 5x long on margin since 9900USD.
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:42:16
It's making it very hard to predict which way BTC is going to break, up or down. If the price is artificially held up long enough those skiddish investors may have the courage to come back out of a false sense of security and we may have another FOMO due to the successive bump in value when they start to come back in.
A lot of people are very bitter about what happened in 2017. Institutional investors, whales. Even some of the best and richest investors took some hefty losses. The latest dump may have burned their toes when they took a dip and BTC may fall back down to 5-8kish.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:05:46
I'm sure like minded people as yourself said the same thing when 14k crashed and burned. I sold off at 13k. Get my drift? I made money, they didn't. Hogs get slaughtered.

I can understand why the government feels the need to implement KYC and AML but you are right about things getting regulated to death. If they take one thing from the whole Bitcoin movement it should be that people no longer feel like they have a voice in anything anymore and Bitcoin in itself is a cry for help from those who have lost all hope of reform. It would make too much sense for the fed and the IRS to take a step back, listen to the people, and change accordingly even if it's only in small and incremental steps. From a regulatory standpoint crypto is scary at the moment. It's bad when Binance pretty much announces that they are writing off the US market until they can come up with a product to meet our regulations. Do you think Binance found out something unannounced yet to the public? I'm sure the CEO had some inside connections somewhere.

Remember that Warren Buffett is far richer than any of us and people arent paying hundreds of thousands to hear us speak. Buffet is an OG. He knows how to make money and a stupendous amount of it.

I understand how  Congress works. I seriously doubt Congress will be any sort of threat anytime soon. Our current Congress is probably the laziest and most fractured circle jerk in existence. As long as someone's growling at BTC (such as the SEC) Congress will deflect the subject. Trust me.
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:06:51
No exchange = BTC has zero value. Look at KYC implementation the pass 2 years in US exchanges. Immense effort to control crypto. Why do you think Binance is exiting the US markets? If the largest exchange is leaving the world's largest economy you know something is seriously wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:18:06
You have no idea how much BTC I have. Why make assumptions? Take my advice or leave it. I'm not claiming to be the best at anything but I do have the experience to back up my statements.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:12:35
I am doing very well.
@_date: 2019-07-03 10:48:09
Institutions also have inside connections to these exchanges. When you are transferring 10-20 BTC at a time and have your funds randomly frozen despite being fully verified on every major exchange........ Sometimes they get triggered over as little as 5 BTC. You never know.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:32:00
If USDT is being pumped I can promise you it's not just by one person. Now pumping some alts can be done with relatively little capital through a margin position. Far less than you would imagine. People that pump and dump coins are scum and should be arrested.
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:50:27
DCA my friend. I think everyone has made that mistake a time or two.

Look at all the sudden long green candles across the past 2 days. The market is clearly being manipulated. Whales are pumping it to start a FOMO reaction.
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:06:56
The one good thing about the fed is that they can manipulate our currency to maintain a relatively stable value. On the flipside they also have the ability to create a false sense of security when things really start to go south and then things get to a point where they suddenly explode like in 2008. The Fed chairman or chairwoman could be considered to be one of the most powerful people on the planet. 
It's a shame Janet Yellen had to go. She was brilliant.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:42:08
If you say so. America sucks in a lot of ways but we are still and incredibly rich country with a relatively high standard of living. Did I put down Malta? No. I never said the US overall was better than anyone else. Your reply is childish.
China, Germany, Russia and the US all have the ability to make shockwaves through the global financial sector. Really big ones.
@_date: 2019-07-03 11:54:47
Malta is a beautiful island and is great but has nowhere the clout of the US in influencing the global financial markets. When the US speaks the room gets quiet. Really quiet....
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:44:00
Honestly I think the next peak will be much higher than 20k so in the end your investment will still be very valuable. 1 month? 3? 6? A year? Nobody knows.
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:49:20
Thanks. You too! I think anyone would be crazy investing a large % in this trading climate.

The whales write those articles to steer the ship.

Maybe Facebook can pull it off.  I hope you are right. Good thing is if Facebook really wants this they definitely have the lawyers to give the SEC and everyone else absolute hell. If Amazon somehow got involved the govt would have a stroke and it would be pretty much a win. With Bezos it wouldn't surprise me at all. Plus their lobbying power. I don't think we are defenseless yet :)
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:53:51
Its artificially inflated atm. Be careful. You are standing on ice.
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:50:41
Its refreshing to find sensible people with common sense here on Reddit. Many will all but fight you when you take a well grounded stance like we have toward crypto. We not only see the benefits of profit but we also take the time to understand the true risks in our investments. When you understand you can therefore be prepared to mitigate if needed.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:16:10
I agree. Investors aside, the reason the USD works is because the Fed can manipulate the value of the USD to make sure it stays relatively stable. We know that a week from now it will likely have the same purchasing power it does now. Retail will never warm up to the idea that they never know how much money they truly have with BTC especially since many retail outlets operate on razor thin margins to begin with. Even a slight downturn in BTC price could bankrupt a business given that they will always have fixed expenses that need to be paid every month regardless of BTC price/value.
Let's be real guys, BTC is nothing but a vector for speculation at this point. 
Do I think BTC has a future? Absolutely. We have to get behind BTC and stop fracturing its purpose with hundreds of useless Altcoins. United we stand divided we fall.
Half of these alts wouldn't exist if people weren't so damned gullible. Give me 3 hours with Wordpress and I could create a website that would make you want to sell water to a fish.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:01:55
Sad part is he/she's right. When you see red candles a mile long you will realize you were the hog that got slaughtered. I'm about to close my positions now.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:47:15
Hell yeah! Be careful, this current market is very risky. On a positive note with BTC being at 11k you are unlikely to be held hostage for very long if things do go south. Of course that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:11:43

Out of all companies I'm not sure Facebook carries the proper image or reputation to be able to successfully drive mainstream crypto adoption.
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:09:49
I guess the way I said that was an overexpression. I think you are right given that they are coming back albeit in a different form. In the end we will prosper no matter what happens. We always find a way to and this time is no different.
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:15:56
I wrote that in the wrong context, I apologize. I do feel that the current system has regulated itself to death and KYC and AML both do not belong in crypto.  I edited my post.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:31:28
I have been in it since 2012. Trust me, many times it's better to take your guaranteed profit and call it a day. When I used to try to ride it to the absolute top I always (in the long run) lost more money than playing it safe. Your returns may not be as big, but those returns are way more consistent.
Too many people get excited over a huge gain only to wait too long and the dump comes and wipes them clean off the map. During a dump it can be damned near impossible to sell a coin. It's becomes a vicious cycle of emotional buying trying to recoup losses and the next thing you know they are bankrupt and badmouthing bitcoin for ruining their life which only perpetuates a negative image of BTC thus hurting its ultimate adoption.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:54:01
I think we have all made that mistake a time or two ��
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:46:08
I have a strong feeling there will be some sort of pullback tonight.
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:02:18
Ain't that the truth. And you get scrutinized to hell and have random holds placed on your funds when you trade in volume. Coinbase pisses me off so bad sometimes.
@_date: 2019-08-10 22:03:12
When the technical indicators all tell us to expect a downtrend and then BTC spikes 1000 bucks without any positive media coverage? 
Hell yeah BTC is being manipulated. Why wouldnt the rich manipulate BTC? They would be stupid not to. They would get arrested in any other market. 
These same manipulators are the sole reason of why BTC will never see the light of day as a solid store of value for the masses nor have broad retail adoption.
I just use BTC to make a quick buck like everyone else. Do I believe it has a future? Only until the exchanges get regulated out of existence.
As long as there are big exchanges it will be next to impossible to have a true anonymous currency because the government will KYC the hell out of every single customer.
If the government can't find out who you are, well, they will find out who you are.......eventually.
