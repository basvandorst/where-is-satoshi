What I wonder is when will the hoarders outnumber the spenders? (I'm collecting until either a total crypto takeover or complete crash).

Perhaps its a bad analogy but as your into critiquing it, why don't you go ahead and continue as to why you disagree with it. Because of course it's a different situation, that is what you do when you make an analogy.

Yes you can, just like aces in the hole.

Since the sentence you quoted from me was about the quantitative easing policy, I just took it from that context.
So were you talking about the cost of printing money? If that is the case then yes it is trivial. But that wasn't the point I was making in the beginning.

I'm sure people are replenishing their bitcoins after making purchases. But will 100% of them will buy back to their full amount or more in a bear market? This I think is highly unlikely.
I think [this article](  went under the radar at the time. But it says that bitpay are adding 1,000 merchants per week (and they aren't even used by 50% of merchants).
I'm skeptical that in this market, there is a higher adoption of bitcoin investors as there are merchant adopters.
Every dump has a grab is simply a slogan. In poker, *Never draw to an inside straight* is also a slogan but it's wrong in many cases.
Ultimately if you want to understand anything, your going to have to eventually drop all the crutches that aided you in your learning and by using the widest array of knowledge available to you, find the underline composition of what it is your studying.

but if that were true then surely there would have been a massive spike earlier when they bought all those bitcoins so they can now sell. Unless they bought very slowly and now decide to sell them?
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:53:03


So true.

I only see fiat money surviving if they somehow restore integrity to it. This is possible to do but I'm not sure it's possible to elect a government that is willing to do so (at least not right now).
I'd even go further to say that not even governments will be possible in the bloated form we see them today because they'll lose the power of printing money and they won't be able to tax people like they've done before. This will create a negative spiral for them which they lose money and then lose the power to enforce the laws which act as revenue builders.
Now I'm not saying this will be anytime soon but eventually and there will be a transitory time where both do coexist (like there is at the moment). However, fiat will be looked at as some kind of ridiculous stone age tool.

I was simply saying why I think bitcoin will outlast fiat. Because of things like quantitative easing, I believe fiat will eventually fall.
What part of this do you disagree with?
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:37:40
What confuses me abou your post is that you say the banks are manipulating. If this were true, wouldn't it also mean the banks were early adopters?

I'm not a trader but I play poker for a living. Can I give you this analogy?
Most players will play AA/KK/QQ/AK the same way. Even though you think you are doing well when you get AA vs KK, in the long scheme of things all these hands are simply breaking even with each other.
Now in the graph, you will see big swings as these kinds of hands are dealt against each other. But they aren't the driving factor behind your win or loss rate. You win or lose depending on how you play more trickier hands with much smaller returns. These you can't see very clearly in your graph.
Just like AA vs KK, the market very much has speculators reacting to news to try to ween out small edges with their investment strategy. However, these big moves mask the smaller trickle action of low rpm-high torque forces such as bitcoin adoption vs merchant adoption.
By no means am I saying that the politics behind bitcoin isn't important but simply discounting merchant adoption and subsequent selling is ill-considered. We've never been in the position to buy everyday goods so easily with bitcoin to not consider this in an investment strategy is not taking advantage of all the information you have available.

Having not any knowledge of the term seigneurage, I just took the reply in context of what my initial post was and tried to answer the question in that context. Yes it was a mistake, for that I am sorry.
Now, will you finally say why you disagree with my initial premise?

That's quite amazing actually that fiat is considered so slow. It makes me realise why I am in this for the long haul.

Can you explain to me then why did UK and the US both adopt and continue quantitative easing to keep the economy afloat?
@_date: 2014-05-31 04:48:09
That's quite funny.
I also find it funny that you had to make a throwaway to post it. It makes it seem like you don't stand by your statement with much conviction.
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:06:19
I hadn't.
However, my point was that as bitcoin is pretty much impossible to counterfeit, it will outlast all current fiat currencies.
If you disagree with this then please tell me so. I just don't really care for a debate over some minute point about some economic term which hadn't even entered the discussion.
EDIT-Now if you start another semantically quiz over the true definition of the word 'counterfeit' I will probably kill a dictionary. You don't want me to do that, do you?

Same here, I have always had a crappy old one but I've been thinking of upgrading because I can't spend bitcoins with it. This would be the perfect phone for me.

Just look at the nobel prize winners for economics for the past few decades. They are being awarded it for stuff like analytical methods.
Bitcoin solved the problem of counterfeit money ffs.
This not the biggest invention to arrive since the internet. It isn't even the biggest innovation to arrive since the four crop rotation. Bitcoin is the biggest innovation to ever hit us.
Who gives a fuck about a few idiots laughing at our shorterm problems. Let them. It is akin to scientologists laughing at the none zenu believers.
I'd much rather do business with the third world that became bitcoin rich than the spoilt adult sized children the west currently is swamped in.

I bet out of all the people that read this post, 90% of them understood what I was saying.
Firstly I show that I didn't understand what seigneurage was then when I tried to be more clear that I was talking about quantitative easing (which I equate with counterfeiting), you try to force an opinion on me that I was talking about something else...
