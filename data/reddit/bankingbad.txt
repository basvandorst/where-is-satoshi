Judging from the 2FA tab appearing in the login screen, it knows I have 2FA setting enabled. With or without the "never remember" option, it shouldn't allow bypassing 2FA after a certain time. And there isn't more thing to set for 2FA as far as I know. So I think it's a bug that is triggered at a certain condition, which is very unclear.
I switched to other 2FA options and it seems to work just fine. So it might be something to do with the way they set up google auth.

How do you define "a" browsing session?
I can still login without 2FA after rebooting my machine a day later.
I would imagine after rebooting a machine it should be a new session.

then, what's the meaning of the "never remember" feature in the blockchain? I am not talking about the "never remember" window that pops up in the browser. It's the "never remember" feature in 2FA of blockchain.info. 
Besides, I can login without 2FA a "day" later (following a reboot).
In 2FA, there is an option for google auth. Once you choose it, it shows a QR code, which you can scan using your phone app, and the app generates OTP with a timer, which keeps changing (in about every 30 sec). So in principle, when you login, you need to type the number at the time of your login. This works for other website very well as it supposed to be..

I speak Korean. Actually it's not bad at all. I am not trying to spin it, but they simply delayed any serious decision. No restriction on any personal trading. They simply warned "investors" that if you lose money playing with bitcoins, nobody will save you since there is no law. A funny thing is that they also said it's not taxable either since it's just commodity or goods. But they will watch anybody using it to avoid tax. So no tax until further notice....

That's ok. It's very weird and subtle. I might have to switch to some other 2FA option.
