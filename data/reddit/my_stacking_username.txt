I agree with you completely. A Mastercard for Bitcoin will have to exist for people like my parents to ever use it. Having that flexibility is what makes it great. 
Bitcoin people for all their free market talk, really hate the idea of someone in a free market making anything centralized. If the free market demands it and it only adds quality to the scenario, there is nothing wrong with it

I'm going to "go there" for a moment and ask the question. 
Isn't this cyber bullying? Just because the internet seems to hate Kanye and South Park has made fun of him pretty successfully, isn't it still just picking on a particular person on the internet?
Just because he is famous/rich, doesn't mean he isn't a person
Okay, I'm done

This pleases me.
Take a look at the Armory platform. He has some cool concepts, like seeded wallets that all you have to do is restore the wallet and all addresses are created the same each time (so you can recover all of your addresses). His concept would be amazing if it had alternate-crypto currency support too

Hey! Thanks! Glad I could make you laugh. Happy Thanksgiving!
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:12:56
Because im bored. Here is where I went.
Since Six = 3 it indicates the number of letters. The letters individually go
11 3 6 2
you can spell north west and east with the words (either north west or north east). So i look at coordinates. 62N 113W corresponds to the corner of the great slave lake and 62N 113E seems to land right near the city of MIRNYY russia. None of these seem to be the answer but if it gets you to the right place I would appreciate a tip for helping out if you manage to win 
Thanks :)

The message appears to be one of getting a name out there. It should really have the word "Bitcoin" on it though. One of those things, if you get a person to go "what is a bitcoin" then you have planted a seed. It might be malicious but the end-goal is exposure. Even if it is seen as negative.

micro has an actual meaning, you can't just arbitrarily use that for something else. 1 microBTC(or µBTC) = 10^(-6) BTC or .000001 BTC
20 micros is worth $0.000655 atm
0.01 BTC would be a centibit (like a centimeter is 1/100 of a meter)
You can call this a bitcent like we do for 1/100 of a dollar.
