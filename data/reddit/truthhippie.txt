I haven't gotten it yet. Can you resend? Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:54:48
PM me an invite please, too. Thanks

Can you elaborate on this? I just watched a video about Tether and how it might bring down Bitcoin and be worse than Mt. Gox for the community.

This is awesome. I can't wait to get a house - the house that  bitcoin built. Wish me luck! To the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:46:04
Now this would be the moon. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:59:02
This was me. Sigh.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:11:32
I'm that weirdo, but from 2013. I obviously wish I had bought more. Got scared. Dumb. Dumb.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:15:34
Also one of my biggest fears.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:10:59
My biggest fear! 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:51:09
My hope have it pinned at 100k
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:30:45
This is what I've been thinking lately. And it feels a lot like Mt. Gox days
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:24:03
Holy cow. That was some serious scary you posted there.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:55:13
This. The shoe shine moment.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:15:23
This is what I'm thinking - or hoping anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:44:56
 It was scary then, and it's scary now.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:51:06
I'm so grateful for this community.....hodling it together. The larger market has no community like this and that's an edge we have, right?
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:48:26
It is amazing how psychological it is - and, yes, nerve wracking. I want it to go down so I can buy, but then it freaks you out when it happens!
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:15:46
That is some beautiful writing, actually.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:15:50
Oh, I was there for that. I was there. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:14:15
Me either. Well, I didn't expect it to be a sustained correction like this. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:11:48
I was on this reddit then, too.Reading through these posts to see if I can handle it again. I guess that's what most of us are doing?

The average person knows about bitcoin, now, thanks to all the hype. But if you had wanted to get in during that last run up, Gemini and Coinbase, et al, were so swamped they weren't able to process all the requests. Do you really think the average Joe got to put any money it yet? In my experience, my friends know about bitcoin but none of them have bought any.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:14:46
I can vouch for this because I wish I had bought more after Mt. Gox. I got scared then, and tbh, I'm a little worried now. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:45:37
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:46:02
I like that term - crypto winter
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:51:30
I was thinking this, too. It was amazing to watch, but also terrifying because you knew - had to know - it wasn't going to last.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:43:39
Me too. Me too. Please, please, please.
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:58:04
This dates back a lot further than that! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:54:54
I only have two friends in the crypto world. The rest know of it but would never buy it. Sorry for your friends if they have losses, but that was me after Mt. Gox. Tell them to hold, if you can.
