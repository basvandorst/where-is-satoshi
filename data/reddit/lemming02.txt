One word: TREZOR

I did. $30. I figure it's the least I could do for a browser I've been using for the last 6 years.
I would have donated more if the Bitcoin logo was on their donation page.

Too bad the shipping cost is too prohibitive for country.
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:27:54
I agree. We should all grow up and act responsibly. 
This means registering the Bitcoin trademark and sending out DCMA notices anywhere it is spoken of in a parody or negative light. It's the responsible thing to do.

I'm 90% in ... I just need the final 10% ... Anyone willing to sell me $10 of BTC?
@_date: 2014-09-03 02:41:36
First world problem.
In a way it's good not having enough BTC to be targeted ... (in a very very small way that is)

I wonder how many turn up when it's time to discuss pay increases for said 'old white folk'.

I saw one of these "Non-VISA", illicit transactions go down the other day.
It looked like they were buying sushi. But who really knows?
@_date: 2014-09-18 05:13:28
So you're the one driving prices down!

It pains me to sell into this market. But I had to sell some the other day to pay the bills. Then, with my luck, it went up right after I sold.  I think I sold at the very bottom. As I sold them I was saying to myself "this is the perfect time to buy. I should be buying not selling". 
FYI - I purchased at $5.

People didn't care about hypertext either.

Breaking News - I Now Accept Bitcoin from Any Location Globally!
@_date: 2014-09-16 01:25:41
I don't see any BUTTCOIN plates. This kind of thing will make them jealous.
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:01:30
This is possibly the only time I've found a bitcoin logo annoying.
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:57:31
Great news! Should push the price up another -5%.
@_date: 2014-12-16 22:14:44
This news is great. We should be good for another -5% today.

You had me at 2 degrees. Then you went and threw a gutair into the mix.

He lost me after his inane logic that "not legal tender" somehow makes it illegal. 
The AUD is "not legal tender" in the USA. That does not make it "illegal". It just means people are not obliged to accept AUD.

Does Western Union ring a bell?
@_date: 2014-09-11 20:34:55
I don't know what to say. Reddit bitcoiners must be the most generous people on the internet. I'll use the $10 to pay it forward.
@_date: 2014-09-11 14:41:11
Bitcoins is now a safe hazens.

Seems like a case of sour grapes to me.

The fees are just regular legal fees. Trust me, I've been paying my prince for years ... as soon as he claims his rightful inheritance he'll be sending me lots of money.
@_date: 2014-12-17 10:42:01
Any more good news is bound to change the bitcoin price another -5%.
