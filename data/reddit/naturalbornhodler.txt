He didn't say we should just stick with 1MB forever. Why so defensive?
@_date: 2015-12-12 14:56:44
I'll wait until it's easier then. What happens if you send a time-locked transaction to a wallet that doesn't support CLTV yet? Will you still be able to spend it after the lock expires or does the wallet need to treat it differently?
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:13:19
Watch Jeff Garzik's recent talk. He says BIP102 would be the ideal opportunity to make a hard fork because it's a very simple integer change that would allow us to gain important field data about what happens when a hard fork occurs. Since SW can be deployed with a soft fork, it should be. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 08:09:02
Cool script!
Does CLTV allow you to designate your own bitcoin address? Like what if I want to use an address/privkey from my hardware wallet? I thought I would be able to send a time-locked transaction to any address I want.
@_date: 2015-12-09 22:39:24
No, your flair is gone because you unchecked "Show my flair on this subreddit." Mike Hearn confirmed that for everyone. I remember that stupid, childish melodrama all too well. Glad to see that you're finally trying to make up for recent transgressions.

Developers need to lead by example. I don't want to single out but there are several devs who quickly make things personal. When they do that, it sends a signal to everyone else that the gloves are off. Developers can prevent things from getting ugly by if they care enough.

What you fail to understand is that what Mike is doing is just a bunch of hand waving while Adam has been working on sidechains and lightning.
@_date: 2015-12-12 03:54:40
Aren't wallets also nodes? So even if you only have 0.1 BTC in your lightning wallet, it will help with network routing.

I run Bitcoin Core and did not get a warning? The last warning I got was months ago when it needed an update.
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:53:31
The question was what makes a hard fork contentious or not. If the hard fork is triggered by software other than the reference implementation, that is a good sign that the hard fork is highly contentious.

I'm clueless. Can you do this with Bitcoin Core? Has anyone tried this CLTV demo from @_date: 2015-12-27 08:42:53
most certainly did. He showed you exactly why your brute force strategy on reddit is foolish. 
Ps. I want your username. Give it to me. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:23:01
You can agree on what the problem is, while disagreeing on the solution.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:59:09
The bias is toward caution. There's over $3 billion at stake so the caution is warranted.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:33:24
You do realise that 51% is **not** consensus, right?
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:42:16
Its unbelievable how they find every whisper of bitcoin anywhere on reddit, then crosspost and brigade the living shit out of it, then blame us for it. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:36:00
Sounds to me like he's looking for alternatives. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:14:26


Writing a BIP that other developers agree to implement with the reference client, rather than attempting to highjack the protocol with an alternate implementation.
@_date: 2015-06-23 10:47:29
He didn't agree with your suggestion? Have you tried sabotage?
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:34:24
Of course they want to scale bitcoin. They just don't agree with Mike about how it should be scaled. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 23:53:41
A lot more realistic than 8GB, wouldn't you say?
@_date: 2015-12-22 07:32:48

@_date: 2015-12-12 11:57:28
How do we use it?
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:27:27
The consensus model hasn't failed at all. It's working as intended in that a single person can't change the protocol. Not even Gavin. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:32:55
Forking the blockchain is necessary because the core devs think it's not yet necessary? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:18:44
Gavin said he unchecked the flair box, so resubscribing wouldn't matter. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:49:14
... and the people who are intent on highjacking the protocol, regardless of the damage it will cause.

Merchants don't have to convert to fiat to avoid a double spend. They just have to wait for a confirmation or two. By accepting unconfirmed transactions, Coinbase is setting unrealistic expectations for merchants. Coinbase has the responsibility to educate their clients on how to use bitcoin properly. For example, by using it properly themselves.

He's exaggerating, but it's called Replace By Fee (RBF). If you have a transaction that's stuck, you can send another with a higher fee to unstick it. If you're getting paid in bitcoin then just wait for at least one confirmation like always.

Right now there's no problem leaving the US. The risk is in reentering. I would make sure the seed is backed up at home, possibly also with a second backup device.

How much money have you paid to Mike Hearn, both publicly and privately? We know [you paid him AT LEAST $100,000]( to develop Lighthouse, which just so happens to require BitcoinXT.

Sure, you can memorize your PayPal username and password. The question is whether or not PayPal will allow you to move your money as you please. Their track record in this department is less than superb. 
If you memorize a deterministic seed, you can recover your wealth from anywhere with an internet connection, without having to trust that PayPal will permit you access to your wealth. 
Of course, if you're willing to trust PayPal with your savings, be my guest.

You're willing to fork bitcoin into an altcoin with just enough hashing power to damage bitcoin in the process, just to give Mike complete control over future development? You want to exile all the expertise of the core dev team and centralize development to a single radical dictator?

That's the problem. You don't KNOW that they would. You're putting the network at risk because you just HOPE that the rest of the ecosystem changes their mind. If you're wrong, then everything will go to shit and you'll be partly to blame. People promoting XT seriously do not understand how reckless they're being.
If XT were to get a super majority then there would be no need for XT because it would mean that ACTUAL consensus had been achieved and the changes would just be applied to Bitcoin Core.

It wouldn't much to spool up enough XT nodes to hit 75% and trigger the fork. Maybe a few miners would be foolish enough to run it too. Next thing you know SPV wallets are all fucked up and people are complaining that they can't spend their XT coins at any merchants. There's very good reasons why hard forks aren't determined by 'majority rules'. Mike is putting the whole network at risk because he's too egotistical to accept that his plans are being rejected.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:23:01
A fork that is created without consensus is not bitcoin. The accepted term for coins other than bitcoin is 'altcoin'. Hard forks are conducted by consensus, not by majority. If you want your own XT blockchain, you and Mike should bootstrap it yourselves instead of putting existing infrastructure at risk when it's actually working just fine.

I'm with the miners on this one. I will never run XT because it threatens to fork bitcoin without consensus. 75% of full nodes is **not** consensus, mind you. If Mike wants to be the king developer, he should start his own blockchain from scratch instead of forking bitcoin's.

Certain members of Core have a Twitter troll army at their disposal and now we hear of death threats."

What doesn't make sense? It's a direct quote. He then doubled down on his lie, end of story. He was also called out on several other lies he made and it's not like he's innocent of witch hunting other devs.

Here is what he said: "**I coined the term SPV** so I know exactly what it means
He lied and got called out on the dev list, then told a slightly modified lie again which is also provably false by the words of Satoshi himself. Don't bother trying to defend him. He's been lying his ass off for months and this was only the most laughable.
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:02:53
You're still mad Wladimir finally banned you for trolling IRC but that's no reason to continue spreading lies. The block size increase will happen but Core devs are faced with poisonous distractions that we could do without.

Basically you would establish a multisig address between you and Starbucks. You  pay the standard miner fee to 'lock' your monthly coffee budget at this address. This acts as an escrow and Starbucks can't steal your monthly budget. Every morning you can make an instantaneous payment that doesn't require any confirmation. Starbucks could give you refunds instantaneously too.
If you decide you hate Starbucks coffee, you can unlock the remainder of your budget and go somewhere else. If Starbucks decides they don't want to sell you coffee anymore, they can unlock the funds you paid them. Either way, the multisig address will eventually be closed and there will be another miner's fee. Then you'll establish a new multisig address for next month's coffee.
There will probably be intermediaries or hubs at first, which is where you and Starbucks both link to BitPay. Each morning you pay BitPay for your coffee, who forwards that to Starbucks.

Wishful thinking. Developers have no incentive to continue working on a project to pick up slack for a community who despised them so much that they 'fired' them.

They're working on one of several implementations and it's all open source. If they pull it off then they deserve to earn something for their work. They anticipate it will expand bitcoin's reach to far more people, which will lead to a more valuable network.

Thanks for the tip! I'll check it out.


It is P2P but major retailers will probably be hesitant to jump on board at first and decide to use a processor until they realize they can just do it themselves.
Wallets could be built on top of existing wallets. There could be a section for 'subscribing' to certain businesses where you transact a lot. That's might be a couple years away though.

If you know the saying, why are you being intentionally deceptive? Your title clearly says "Bigger Blocks = Higher Prices", implying that bigger blocks lead to higher prices. You're misleading people into supporting your agenda by claiming that it will lead to higher prices.

Bruce, you are blaming Coinbase's terrible customer service track record on regulations. Even if there were no regulations at all, their service would still suck balls. They barely even qualify as a bitcoin company. Stop being an apologist for shitty business ethics.
