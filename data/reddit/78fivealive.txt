Banks are not simply money lockers.  Banks allocate capital.  A money system in which capital cannot be aggregated and re-allocated is a flaw not an advantage.

Thanks for the links.  The responses have been quite eye-opening, particularly multisig.  The Colored Coins concept sounds interesting but there's almost no detail around it.

That's not how money creation works.  At all.

You can't trust cash, that's why you put in an insured bank.
You can't trust cars, that's why you insure them.
You can't trust iPhones, period, but you only ever need just one.
You can't trust Bitcoins, and like iPhones but unlike cash and cars, there's fuck all you can do about it.

I'm interested... what do you think is the difference between a "debit" and a "debt?"  And how do wallets already contain debits?
The way I think of a "debit" is as a form of negative asset in an account.  That is, an account balance is just the credits minus debits, and to the extent the account is allowed to go negative, that negative balance is a "debt."
How do wallets currently record debits?

Sage advice, but I want to add that exchanging currencies is not 'investing.' Investing is putting money to productive use. Buying bitcoins is just changing money from one form to another.

Right, and if I understand correctly, there's no "keeper" of the wallet in the way an escrow agent is the bailee or custodian for the escrow account.  In other words, we don't have to trust that the 3rd party won't run away with the Bitcoins.  Do I have that right?

The problem is how do we create a *private* good that can give me a return on my investment?  We would need a way to lend and invest Bitcoins with an expectation of repayment.  I'm not saying it can't be done, but I haven't heard any proposals.

Yes and it can be extremely profitable.  And when the Fed does make a huge profit, guess what it has to do.
It has to return it to the taxpayers.
The Federal Reserve has no value as a business concern.
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:39:10
It will still have to be done through an intermediary.  Even "peer-to-peer" lending is done through banks.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:23:02
Not much sense being made,  nothing about BTC would obviate banks or some intermediary  that served the same purpose.  As for unstable currencies, BTC is about the worst there is.

I can't watch an entire 30 minutes cartoon at the moment, but let me assume for the moment it makes an argument somewhat along the following: why is it that everyday people have to work so hard for their money, while bankers can just print money at the press of a button?  This rather honest question has become rhetorical, a flashpoint for the outraged and the uninformed to rise against the system.
There are two misunderstood facts that have contribute to this misconception.  (1) Only the Federal Reserve can print U.S. , no other bank may do this.  (2) When the Federal Reserve prints money, unlike a dollars nybody else in the entire world, it views money as an obligation which it records on its balance sheet as a liability, while *everybody else* views money as an asset.  So, it's not surprising that the 'printing money' fallacy is so widespread.
It's complicated, and it gets more complicated the more you dig into it, because this system evolved, it was not per se designed.  Its origins are rather shrouded in mystery, like most of our core institutions.  Also, it's quite advanced and adapted for the unfathomable scales of the modern economy.
Bitcoin, in my view, is a lot more like old-fashioned gold.  What I'd theorize is that, if Bitcoin takes hold as a widespread Internet currency, a lot of the difficulties in holding and exchanging Bitcoins will be lead to certain solutions like Bitcoin banks, which will lead to certain problems like interbank settlements, which will lead to certain solutions like a central settlement bank, which will lead to certain problems like...  You see where this is going?

Money's not just money, stop rationalizing. For most working people, money represents all the things we have to sacrifice -- being with our families, living in places we hate, being estranged from our neighbors and from nature -- so that we could sustain ourselves.  Money is the thing we trade so much of our lives for.  So, no, losing a shitload of money is having to accept that all of those lost moments were for nothing.  Just wasted life and lost love.

Without advising one way or another, just be mindful that converting cash into Bitcoins is not an investment.  The Bitcoins you hold will just sit there, perhaps losing or gaining value, but those Bitcoins do not represent any sort of investment.  In other words, Bitcoins are just a form of money with no inherent value.
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:32:27
Thanks for that.
I use the term 'credit' very broadly -- any situation in which one person has a duty to pay another person at some point in the future.  What I'm curious about is whether it's possible to conduct a credit transaction entirely through Bitcoin, without relying on a trusted 3rd party or law enforcement?
I suppose multisig seems pretty promising, but only where credit is used to ensure completion.  It doesn't solve the issue where one party doesn't have the Bitcoins yet, but promises to deliver in the future.  What I find interesting is that the multisig wallet does not belong to anyone in the legal sense, there is no custodian responsible for the safekeeping of the escrow funds.  That eliminates the need for a huge body of law and regulation.
Bitcoin will push the law to its limits.  Essentially the Blockchain makes every single Bitcoin node partially responsible for everything that happens, so who do you sue?  Since it's anonymous and global, this is really beyond the reach of the law.
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:34:23
This is what I figured as well.  In other words, there is no way around the use of an account at a trusted intermediary in order to effect secure credit transactions.  As you point out, anonymity is actually quite a weakness of Bitcoin, because debts could just be abandoned.  Ultimately we need personal accountability in order to transact on credit.

The supply of money needs to scale with the amount of economic output.  If the economy grows faster than the supply of money, growth is limited and there will be deflation.  When a gold coin increases significantly in value, people will divide it to allow smaller and more frequent payments.  Gold was a great form of money not just because it was scarce, but also, conversely, because it was easily divisible.
This is how Bitcoin will work.  If a large chunk of the economy adopts Bitcoin for payment, and mining can't jeep up with the demand for new money, the result will be that people will use smaller fractional Bitcoins, as they are almost infinitely divisible.  In this sense Bitcoins are a lot like gold.
If you think it through, then, fiat paper is a lot more equitable as it doesn't reward money hoarders.  Bitcoiners are hoarding Bitcoins in hopes of getting rich, not to bring about equality.  Just the opposite, in fact

That was a fantastic article, thanks for the link.
But this seems to me retracing the same evolutionary steps as our current financial payment system, and that path requires the emergence of large financial intermediaries, subject to government regulation and oversight.  Multisig Bitcoin seems to be a recreation of escrow, requiring an escrow agent.
Which is fine, but the Bitcoin 'ethos' really seems to be about undermining institutional power by eliminating the need for financial intermediaries altogether.  Thus you have people saying vague things like since nobody controls Bitcoin, it will put power back in the hands of the people.  Well, that's a nice notion, if your economy consists only of cash-and-carry, but then again, why not just use Tide soap as a currency, as some people do?
But we know the vast majority of transactions involve credit -- everything from buying daily staples to buying a whole business -- which is where intermediaries come from.  I just don't see what it is about Bitcoin which would allow us to conduct complex credit transactions without the need for a robust system of intermediaries subject to government oversight.

If any of you people are buying BTC for the purpose of furthering a movement, or a new financial world order, than you should get off your ass rather than trade currencies.
If you any of you people were buying BTC to speculate, then you should accept your loss the same way you'd accept losing at Vegas.
If you bought BTC because it was more convenient than money, then you're a bit deluded.
So maybe I'd feel for the deluded person, but I highly doubt any of you are.  I feel nothing for the second bucket, because you knew it was a gamble all along.  I suppose I pity the first bucket, people who thought they were doing something meaningful by trading currencies.

No state will allow this.  States do not need to ban bitcoin to suppress it.  All they have to do is make it prohibitively expensive for banks to hold and trade it.  Without institutional support, the, BTC will only play a tangential role in commerce.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:43:29
I've never owned a bitcoin, but this type of volatility means the market is very shallow.  That means there's not that much money in the market, so don't think your holdings are actually worth [no. of bitcoins x spot price], any big seller will overwhelm interest and the price will promptly drop.  That's the bubble -- just a handful of people deciding to sell will crater the price.

It doesn't seem that BTC is "about" anything.  It has some predictable properties, and that's it.  Speculators, thieves, true believers, come one come all, BTC will still be BTC.

Why would this be inherent to Bitcoin?  What would be so special about 51% as a threshold for market power?
There was something about a crypto attack that you could do at 51% computing power, something you could not do at 49%.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:26:21
The problem is that the likelihood of a bubble bursting increases as it expands, because the temptation to reap the profit goes up, as does the awareness of it being a bubble.  Seems like it's already happening?  Extreme market friction -- the difficulty of getting cash in and out of BTC -- may be mitigating here.

@_date: 2013-04-12 02:13:12
That doesn't sound right at all.  I remember the Satoshi paper disclosed a potential *cryptographic* vulnerability if a single person could control &gt;50% of the total BTC-mining computing power.  I don't understand the math very well or at all, but is this what you were thinking about?  It's got nothing to do with the dollar market value of BTC.  In fact, BTC makes no provisions for its relative value to real currencies, that's totally market-driven.
