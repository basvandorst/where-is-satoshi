Stage one is the last dangerous and easiest to treat.

Hmm... It was probably Ubuntu circa 2013 when I was also first getting into Bitcoin. I don't remember the installation process, but I pretty much followed the guide and then never could boot into anything graphical afterwards. The whole "following the guide and it doesn't work a few steps in" issue is something I have run into every single time I've tried Linux when trying to regain the basic functionality I'm used to in other OSes.
I learn things a lot of time just to learn them/increase nerd points, but Linux has always been a roadblock for whatever reason. I think the last time I really did anything productive with it was using Backtrack and a USB wifi adapter to "hack" (lol, script kiddie for life) APs. Pretty fucking cool, no doubt, but there are so many little issues that keep me from being able to use it beyond novelties like that.

I swear the situation with Linux and drivers hasn't changed a bit since I picked up Red Hat back in the early 2000s. I've been building and troubleshooting Windows PCs for over 17 years now, but fuck me if I can get a recent graphics driver installed on any distro of Linux.

Erowid.org is currently running a donation campaign with up to $250,000 matched by the Pineapple Fund. They deserve every penny.

Actually, I have. I go back and try a distro every couple years just to see what's up. It was such a giant pain in the ass to install nVidia drivers for a smaller game library and slower performance than Windows, so what's the point? I have lots of respect for open source and I _want_ to get into Linux, but it's just such a hassle for a worse (IMO, of course) user experience. There are so many minor annoyances that I just can't get over. It has improved _massively_ since I first started looking into it, and I see the progress every time I go check it out, but it's nowhere near ready for mainstream nerds, nevermind the general population.
Maybe I'll have to give it another shot soon.

I don't see how that's relevant.

It sure does. It's not the whole reason, but it's certainly a factor.
The network effect is one reason why you can't clone Bitcoin's source code and expect your new altcoin to be the same value as Bitcoin despite being fundamentally identical. The more people use a service, the more value it has. Bitcoin being first on the scene gave it a large lead right out of the gate.

Oh, gotcha! I agree totally.

I routinely spent 20-22 BTC monthly back in 2012.

Just about every bank does this. Use your debit card in an ATM, it charges your bank in whatever the local currency is, your bank converts it at the daily rate plus 1 or 2%. I was in Italy for two years (military) and Japan for 2 months and every single bank I saw people using did this.
