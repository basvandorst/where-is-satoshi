That sounds like a gambling profile, not like an investor profile. You better re-consider your point of view.

if that happens the bank {and with them the government} will start having control over bitcoin. that's now really what we want for our decentralized currency

So you believe bitcoin will fall? think again - the internet needs to fall for that to happen. People will never let bitcoin go!

which country? maybe you can try localbitcoins?

Supporting multiple currencies is most important. Fees for exchanging currencies could be from 2-4%...

That's the way to do it! Hawaii and other islands like it are the ultimate experiment

i can't wait to see the day when Bitcoin will overrun paypal.
@_date: 2014-10-03 03:43:19
We should all stay to Bitcoin. Not shatter around but stay together and keep Bitcoin strong.
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:41:08
so just scan it and calculates the amount itself? that is fully automated?
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:45:37
could be true. insider info works everywhere especially on trading deals!

This is shit bro i don't know why even so many ppl are using web-based wallets when you need just to research how to protect yourself. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:45:31
update this, i am also interested.

That does not sound good. 
If someone obtains 1 key we would not know. 
If someone obtains 2 keys we would not know. 
And if he manages to obtain the 3rd key then a 51% attacks occurs which is pretty scary [especially when it comes at once. everyone will be caught off-guard].
