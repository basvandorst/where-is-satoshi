Multibit, latest version.

It's a small, old laptop that I'm using because it's low power and because my miners are USB sticks, so I don't need much power behind them.
Also it's the only spare computer I have at the moment. But if the only solution is to install Linux instead, I'm willing to do that, since I only use it for mining.

Nope, wasn't given a reason. And yes, it was NSFW flagged.
I just assumed that sort of post is frowned upon, so, I was looking for places where I could.

Yeah, I've been considering it. Actually I tried to order one once but they were sold out. They go fast; I may have to break down and backorder one.

The prices are pretty steep and I'm not confident of the latency from Brazil; thanks for answering though.

Can I reduce the fee by running my own bitcoid, then? I have a VPS sitting idle and sometimes use it as a node for other currencies anyway.

I'm not hosting original porn; for my new site, I'm trying out reselling.
I also have a blog where I post nekkid pictures of da ladies, which is against the terms of service of most providers (my current one hasn't noticed, but it makes me uncomfortable that I could lose everything if they found out).

Yes, it's a powered hub. I'll edit the post.

There's always that guy

I'll try it later; I'm already 10gb into armory, but 20gb is no joke no matter what.

I've been comparing it with all other hosts and I gotta say, it looks really good. I'll post what I end up going with (for anyone who's curious; I know web host reviews interest me but I'm an odd bird =p).
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:47:08
Yeah, I expect so. I'm not making a large investment; just getting my feet wet and seeing what happens.

I like namecheap! My current site is there. I didn't know they allowed adult on vps, I only knew they don't allow it on shared.
That might be an option for me. But I don't really want to spend the money for a vps for what could be a failed experiment, is the only thing. I'm hoping to go cheap until I need to upgrade.

Ubuntu makes me cranky. For some reason, at some point, they removed the ability to drag icons onto the desktop. What the actual fuck, Ubuntu?
So I'll probably go with something different, maybe Mint.

I'm trying Armory as we speak. Thank you for the only helpful response.

Excuse me? Adult websites are perfectly legitimate and among the biggest online businesses. They're also content that people might be more comfortable spending bitcoin on instead of using their check card. I honestly don't know what you're on about.

Hey, I just wanted to let you know that j went with chunkhost and I love it. A VPS is new to me and it's been a challenge, but the site is almost migrated and I've learned a ton in the process. The price can't be beat either. Thanks!
