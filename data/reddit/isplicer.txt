That price differential is not sufficiently disincentive for people to willingly pay 1 sat/b instead of 3. The difference here is like 1 cent. Of course everyone's just gonna bid like, 10, oh wait maybe 20, I don't mind paying 20c to guarantee my transaction's included in the next block.
This thought process continues until the price for getting into the next block is high enough for enough people to think 'ahh that's a bit too much I don't mind waiting', and that's not going to happen at 3 sat/byte. Use your common sense.

Oh, so you want to replace today's global payment systems with BTC, just a version of BTC that's stripped of its irreversibility and decentralised aspect? How exactly would that benefit?
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:30:29
Oh get fucked.
That single point of failure is the collective ability of the US government to collect tax receipts. It's safe enough for the entire global investment community to deem US treasury notes as literally the benchmark for risk-free return.

So you're openly conceding that the popular speculative long argument on BTC is solely entrenched in "past performance is indicative of future gains?" How do you propose I reconcile the fact that the exact same words have been spoken countless times in history before heartbreak? People within the NASDAQ bubble 110% believed they were onto THE UNSTOPPABLE FUTURE before they got fucked.

I agree, but the taxman will always, always get his due. You can't eat bitcoin. You can't clothe your family with bitcoin, nor can you drive bitcoin to work. At some point you'll have to exchange it for real-world stores of value and that's when you'll be asked to provide a paper trail of how you bought that lambo.

In its current form, yes sir.
The fact that it's decentralised, irreversible and immutable is what makes it amazing. The need to force it into your everyday life to pay for groceries is just unnecessary.

I'm starting to think that people on this sub actually believe that. Like, they actually believe in the concept that one can purchase an asset on the market and openly and accessibly expose themselves to guaranteed profit (or with a level of risk wildly, wildly disproportionately low c.f. gain). I wonder what Sharpe ratio they're expecting for BTC?
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:56:18




Using electrum is an excellent first step for those new to bitcoin. The second you purchase coins on an exchange get them the living heck out of there straight into one of your electrum addresses. Repeat after me: not your private key, not your coins.
I wouldn't use electrum or hardware wallets to store my retirements coins, however. From a post I made about an hour ago:
Forget hardware wallets, they're inherently stupid purely because 1) They've been touched by someone else before getting to me and 2) I don't know if it's been replaced by a fake or different firmware. This applies to all hardware wallets.

No, it's not for sure. It's almost for sure. There's a huge difference. You don't know whether your particular unit was flashed with decoy firnware or had a backdoor built in.
I'm sure it's fine for casual storage and to keep some money that needs to be constantly transacted but ain't no one with a substantial holding betting on the honesty of a hardware wallet manufactured elsewhere when there are far safer alternatives.

Never, ever attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity. People willingly and happily pay 7.5% spreads + 3% fees in an environment where prices differ by 10% between exchanges because they're convinced they're going to be rich. If you don't believe me just read a few posts on this sub.
The people leveraging the blockchain for illegal transfer of money are net sellers of BTC. I can't envision a drug lord wanting to store his millions HODLING on a number of BTCs that vary ridiculously in price; he's cashing out using his Smurfs and storing cash and gold.

I'm simply and respectfully asking what about the current system requires 'the wheel to be broken'.


I am aware, but the end-of-day settlements are guaranteed. I know they're going to happen, in the same way I know the BTC transaction's going to go through. They're both equivalent in their surety. I'm just arguing that BTC is ridiculously complex for this purpose and offers no benefit. Can you please explain what I'm missing?
And please drop the "fiat is credit" nonsense. BTC is credit too, when I send you BTC your address is being credited (UXTO), mine is being debited (TXN input). It's accounting 101 and the backbone of any functioning payment system.
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:29:05


Absolute rubbish. You don't need to link exchanges to terrorism to shut them down, that level of execute deception is used for serious threats, which bitcoin is nowhere yet near being. It's market cap is less than that of Starbucks and 0.3% that of the S&amp;P 500. Even that's irrelevant because the regulator's attack on exchanges will be far simpler: there is no way to secure the underlying assets; if employees at a hedge fund attempted fraud they'd be tracked down, the money trail followed, their assets frozen and funds returned to their owners. If a few key employees at coinbase got the private key out, everyone is irreversibly fucked. Which I think is perfectly fine - that's the nature of decentralisation - but attacking exchanges would be a cinch for regulators.


That's good advice mate. However I don't trust trezor either. I don't know if the firmware has a backdoor. I don't know the unit wasn't tampered with at the factory. I don't know that the firmware hasn't been flashed to something else at some other step.

The US dollar is backed by the collective ability of the state to organise a society where work is performed and tax receipts are collected in order to pay its creditors. The USD is backed by the US's incentive to remain solvent and they night have a few ways of achieving this. They're called aircraft carriers.
You present an argument except sadly your knowledge is half baked. You know just enough to structure a response that makes sense to everyone as uneducated as you are about how finance works but in reality your comment is downright deceptive and misleading.
What about QE doesn't make sense? The federal reserve creates currency and purchases assets to encourage investment in certain sectors. This amount is a debit against the fed's balance sheet and will be unwound.

Why exactly would that be the dream? He probably completed the payment instantly with his credit card, any mistakes reversible, everyone's happy. No need to wait for blockchain confirmations and ridiculous fees?
You hear and see countless stories about exchange hacks, people losing private keys, setting the wrong fees etc. I have never had an issue with currently used payment systems and the one time I didn't recognise a $11 transaction it was reversed no questions asked (it was actually my transaction that I had forgotten about and just went back to the Cafe and paid cash after apologising). 
Or do you want it to be the dream because widespread adoption in such scenarios would mean you make a speculative gain on the coins you're holding?  
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:01:34
Friendly bet? Give me a BTC address and I'll send you $2 with a 3 sat/b fee. If it doesn't confirm within 15 minutes you owe me $2 ($4 in total for the first that'll eventually go through).

You seem like a really reasonable person so I'll conclude by saying this: what you described above is absolutely fantastic. If people are betting some money lying around on an exciting new asset that they're interested and passionate about, that is awesome. If they're coming onto this sub to share their energy with other likeminded people and bask in that sense of comfort and anticipation for the future, that's literally what humans were put on this earth to feel.
My issue is with posts like this:




i'm a millionaire now, but who cares about those silly usd valuations, its all about the bitcoins you own :)
So fuck you, doubters.
lets go to the moon :)
The above is insidious and dangerous to the public because some college kid is going to come onto this board, read the posts about how he can buy a Ferrari if he just puts his scholarship money into BTC, he'll want to believe this and he will given all the blind reinforcement he needs before he becomes one with the hive.
How do I know? I was that college kid who bought crappy penny stocks during my first year of uni. All the arguments are always 100% the same. Screw the doubters, weak hands, stay faithful, etc. It causes a lot of broken wallets, broken families and broken dreams.

Yes, the replacing fiat system is far superior to the one pegged to gold. It allows central banks to set monetary policy and position the supply of money to suit economic climates.

@_date: 2017-09-15 11:37:32
There's a good chance it will not, that's why the price is plummeting. The blockchain is the future of finance, but I don't think BTC will be it. There has to be some substantial backing for a currency to have value, whether it be 1g of gold or the promise of the US government to pay its debts, which is the definition of risk-free return.
There is no such promise backing BTC. If USD fell to zero against another currency, you could buy all the land and goods in the US for free, that's the backing - if BTC falls to zero there is no underlying value.
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:06:41


Bad logic. If I want my transaction included in the next block I'll bid the amount that's required. Fees are set by those who need ASAP clearance and the posts on this sub about "look at this 500k transaction that cost 5c" are moronic - the sender of those funds was clearly prepared to wait for the transaction to clear whenever, a concept that doesn't apply to 90% of use cases.
If I'm withdrawing money from an exchange that could go down any moment into the safety of my private address, I want it included in the very next block.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:12:21
Yes that's 100% correct. But BTC can still encounter inflation when all coins have been mined through a sustained fall in its exchange rate against the usd. In high interest environments people will be losing money just holding so there will be an outflow chasing wider market rates, leading to this gradual fall which is basically inflation. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:14:21


I have a strongly positive view on the mainstream adaptation of the blockchain into virtually every aspect of our lives, I really do believe it's a development on the same magnitude as the steam engine. I'm just skeptical as to whether bitcoin will be the protocol that ultimately makes it. It very well might but I'm not sure.
What I don't understand is kids on this sub rooting for bitcoin to take the place of petty everyday transactions. Yeah let me just hop on an unregulated, unbacked exchange, pay a 7.5% spread to purchase bitcoin, pay a fee to withdraw it, wait a few blocks, get out my phone when the 20-year old chick at the counter rings up my total and sit in the waiting chair like a moron because I should've set a higher fee. Bitcoin was not designed for this in its current form and I see no problem with current everyday payment systems. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:07:59


No I wouldn't! I too hope that my investments go up by 10000x overnight, we all want the best for ourselves. As I said, if you browse most of the threads on this sub people are legitimately convinced that bitcoin IS going up. Like it actually IS. That's what I think is idiocy.


I genuinely do not believe that. I apologise if it came across so.


If that's genuinely the approach adopted here then I have no argument. That's perfectly fine and would describe a hobby perfectly well. I just think the extent of the blind belief and euphoria is dangerous and will cause a lot of newcomers to naively follow, bet more than they can afford to lose and get screwed. It's always the little guy that gets screwed and that will never change.

It doesn't offend me at all, I hope that everyone makes money and received a positive result with whatever venture they choose. I'm just criticising the extent and the blind belief that many people on this sub hold, putting all their money into bitcoin.


Because there's a chance it might go up astronomically and a well-structured portfolio includes a range of asset classes with different behaviours - reducing overall volatility. This is the basis of modern portfolio theory and I reckon you'd find reading about it really interesting.

I don't entirely agree further than that *some* blockchain coin may (good chance) hold the peg against a national currency in the future. Actually I'm very confident it'll happen.
I just have no reason to believe that it'll be BTC. On one hand, it was the first big coin but historically that hasn't meant much. On the other, it has numerous, numerous technical flaws.

You already can loan money for whatever rate you wish.
Central banks control short term interest rates in the interest of enforcing monetary policy for the benefit of the country: they increase the supply of money during difficult times by lowering rates, increasing inflation and stimulating spending and economic activity. During times of excessive asset inflation they raise rates to prevent runaway inflation.
Thus system has worked really well and whenever I've asked anyone on this sub to explain why the banking system is inherently corrupt all I hear are spit fuelled spatters. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:07:55


You're joking right? Please tell me you're joking.


What tax breaks exactly? CGT discounting is accepted worldwide as a fair norm, and dividends are taxed twice in the US. All currencies are designed to be inflationary, that's when the economy works best.


That's not a terrible argument. However, due to extreme low interest rates and a very strong performance by US multinationals over the past few years it can be argued that forward PE multiples are actually not unreasonable.


Why not stocks? Why not real estate? Why not money markets? All of these are backed by real underlying assets and people invest in them to avoid an inflationary currency. I too hold bitcoin and think it's a good idea for you to as well - but not because it's a good investment - it's a gamble on something that could have huge unknown implications in the future, but let's be careful about the underlying premise we push.
