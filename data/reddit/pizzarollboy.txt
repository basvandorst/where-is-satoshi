You'd only bet that much because you know I'd tell the truth.

I imagine he will be exactly like your first IRL Bitcoiner, but less popular and less interesting.

This seems an acceptable alternative.

Mr. Voorhees, you are better than this. You usually side with doing the right thing, so it is really disheartening to see you trying to defend the poor little scammers.
I eagerly await your revised decision.

No, you don't get to assume anything. Once Bitcoin spreads and competition increases among companies *that's* when you will get to see discounts for bitcoin.
But just assuming that they will do it out of the goodness of their hearts because you're such a special snowflake is *super* *fucking* *obnoxious*.

Nothing embarrasses me more than when a Bitcoiner does the "I deserve it cheaper because reasons" 5-year-old logic thing.
People hound these merchants to take Bitcoin and when they finally do we move the goal post and demand it be cheaper just because we're so special.

You have, at best, a poor understanding of the meaning of what you said.
Besides, the only thing sadder than a Dogecoiner is a "litecoiner".  At least Dogecoin has a cute dog associated with it.

"The post was quickly upvoted to the front page of the subreddit. "
To be fair *everything* in that subreddit is upvoted to the front page. Literally a picture of a Shibe Inu and *nothing* else will get to the front page with 500 upvotes while only 100 are shown as active...

I'm surprised that they ever thought a meme based coin would do anything *but* follow the life cycle of any other meme.
Meme Origin -&gt; LOL HYPE -&gt; Oh, people still think this is funny? -&gt; Seriously, it's not funny anymore.

Being "pro-dogecoin" is just stating a failure to understand the core goals of cryptocurrency in addition to a general lack of maturity?
Calling the rest of us "haters" is just an admission on your part that you are unwilling to learn and grown.
