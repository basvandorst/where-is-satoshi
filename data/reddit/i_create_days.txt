I would be thrilled if the Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama received a donation! They are a 501 (c)(3) non-profit Austrian economics think-tank that survives largely thanks to donations, and I think their work is heroic.
Here's a link to their donation page:
Whether you choose to donate to the Mises Institute or not, your philanthropy is hugely inspiring. Thank you.

He might use linux himself but look forward to the Windows release for other reasons, for example Open Bazaar 3.0 will be accessible to many more people.

I like bread but it's a little lacking in features for me. I really like bitWallet because I'm able to choose the inputs, tx fee, change address, and so on. It has everything I want and still feels simple and intuitive somehow. 
I don't even see an address book or watch-only option in bread. I am jealous of BIP32 though.

I like one-time 12 word backups (used in deterministic wallets like Electrum, breadwallet, Wallet32, Hive, and others). No more messing with wallet.dat files or regular backups!

Where do you plan to store the password for your encrypted wallet backups? Are the paper backups also encrypted?
Don't end up leaving your loved ones a slew of wallet backups without passwords to access them. :)

Count me as another vote for a Trezor to safely store your bitcoins. If you want convenience in addition to security, the Trezor seems miles ahead of everything else.
FYI, if your Trezor breaks and the comany disappears or whatever, you can always get your coins with a simple 12-word phrase provided when you create your wallet. Trezor uses BIP32 and BIP39, which are open, community developed bitcoin standards. You can restore all of your private keys in any wallet that adheres to those standards. It's awesome.

I use bitWallet as my primary hot wallet, so this concerns me. Can you provide a source so I can learn more about these alleged change address shenanigans?
And maybe you already get this, but bitWallet can be denominated in microbits, which is basically the sane as "bits".

I'm working on a comparison of iOS wallets, but it's not finished yet. I will chime in and agree with the breadwallet recommendations.
breadwallet is easy to use, open source, and BIP32 (easy backup and better privacy).
As an alternative, I'll recommend bitWallet. If you need an address book/watch list, or want to adjust transaction fees, choose change addresses, select inputs, etc., than bitWallet might better suit your needs.

Breadwallet. If you don't like it, try bitWallet.

Your mnemonic can be used in other BIP32 and BIP39 deterministic wallets like bitWallet, breadwallet, Wallet32, MultiBit, and others. 
Blockchain.info is not a deterministic wallet, and their mnemonic does not represent a master seed that can retrieve all of your addresses. Electrum is a deterministic wallet that uses a mnemonic, but it is not compatible with your 12 words because Electrum does not use BIP32 and BIP39 yet.

Have you checked out the user manual? I found it accessible and informative.

I like BitStore, and I would personally trust it with small amounts.
I am going to recommend that you try out breadwallet, though. It's open source too, and it's a "deterministic" BIP32/BIP39 wallet. In case you aren't familiar with that, it means two things:
1. Super easy backups. Just write 12 words down and all of your private keys are backed up forever.
2. Improved privacy. A new address is generated for every transaction so people can't easily see what you do with your bitcoin.
I've used a lot of iOS wallets, and I finally settled on breadwallet for now.

I'm really excited about the project! Great work!
I do have one complaint: Transaction fees should be clearly stated. I see no mention of transaction fees anywhere in the wallet or on the website.
Attempting to send one's full balance results in failure without explanation. There should at least be an error window telling the user to leave 100 bits for a TX fee.

It's true. I just had an email exchange with Coinbase where they recommended that 3rd party app. In fact, they told me to use it instead of their original, official app (which I still have from before it was removed). They "no longer support" the old app.
They also said they are working on getting an app in the store under their brand.

How about this one! "A million individuals running their own homebrew money software?"
How does bitcoin make sense to you, while an application using bitcoin built using the same cryptographic trustless-ness, does not make sense?

This guy is trying to push an agenda. You absolutely do not need to run a node. Running a node won't make your coins safer or more valuable.
