The super-computers used by universities are not found in homes.  Too expensive, too much electricity, too hard to program, hot, loud, etc.
Most homes use laptops and tablets, which aren't very good for University Science.

Okay, thank you evoorhees for admitting to dishonestly putting words in gmaxwell's mouth to suit your political agenda.

1) Core won't commit to anything before all data is gathered and testing is complete.
2) Core will not validate your idiotic censorship martyrdom fantasy.

| use of a pejorative like 'ClassicCoins' reveals a staggering prejudice
You have a problem with truth in advertising?
Sorry if the truth hurts.

Very elegant solution.
How do we get this proposal in front of and make sure /HF doesn't brigade like Classic and /BTC?

Bitcoin runs on drama.  Accept that fact, or leave.  Or stay and complain all the time.

I don't think their lawyers would advise them to do that.
Too much liability in the form of very irate customers!  8D

Mine a Classic block?
I lose the 25mb reward subsidy and any tx fees when they get orphaned.
So in-band GavinBlock incentives fail.  Need to bribe out-of-band.

I made a special fork of Classic called 2MB RIGHT MEOW.  Got my gaming rig and mom's laptop overclocked and mining for The Blockchain Alliance, Inc.

So Coinbase will support both forks, and I can trade Classic-coins for Core-coins, then withdraw to whichever fork I prefer?
Does Brian Armstrong cover our losses if catastrophic consensus failure ensues?

Bitcoin + ideological takeover hard fork is no longer Bitcoin.
The Gavinista movement is intentionally self-defeating; they wish to destroy Bitcoin from within.
@_date: 2016-02-07 00:18:06
Not when the fiat from selling Classic-coins is used to buy more Core-coins.  Repeatedly.
@_date: 2016-02-07 05:26:25
What does Coinbase plan to do about this?
They must have a plan for it, since they are backing Classic's contentious hard fork.
I think they will confiscate all Core-Coins and only give back Classic-Coins.  They know what is best for us.

Bitcoin's first contentious hard fork.  $6 billion at stake.
And you say that'll be "undramatic."
Sure, I bet it turns out to be a big yawn.  Typical boring Bitcoin.
