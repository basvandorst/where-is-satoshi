As far as I can tell from browsing the bitcoin subs for six months, it's a person who um... Thinks bitcoin will lose value. I think. And that you should... Eh... Do stuff. Based on that information.

The greater good, friends. The greater good.

I'm in the process of doing this, but there's still the two major hurdles we need to find a way to overcome:
1) Making it easier to understand for the general public
2) Finding a way to exchange fiat for btc without the use of banks
Now, the first can be done, but how the hell are we going to get around the second? As soon as btc becomes an actual threat to the banks, they'll talk to their best buddies in government and find a way to shut the whole thing down. Don't know how, but I'm willing to bet they'll find a way.

Good. We could use some.

I have been musing a long time on an introductory text for non-tecchy people on how to get into Bitcoin. There's plenty of tutorials already, but honestly, I'm not impressed with the quality.
Not exactly the same thing we're talking about here, but I'm fairly set on helping out and doing my bit.

It's not animated [like the original]( :(

I downvoted you because it felt right.

I thought that was war.

TO THE MOOOOOOON!

Works in other countries. The concept is not inherently flawed, but corruption makes it so. It's not the State you're fighting, but the nobility and former slave owners.

Look at the price go! I'll hodl no for drea lfie!

It could be medievaled a little.

Anarchy is the way to go, fuck rule of law, human rights and the concept of civil society.

This is just painful to read. You're still in high school, right? Because if you're older than that and believe what you just said may god have mercy on your ignorant soul.

He transcribed a few bits near the end.
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:52:40
And yet it seems we always have to anyway in the end. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 16:55:08
But didn't you hear? He just bought a Ferrari F430 Spyder with the money he made! IT'S FOOLPROOF!
@_date: 2013-07-02 12:20:39
Huh. That's actually what drew me in. I've been looking for a massive, text-book style introduction to every facet and history of bitcoin. Not that this is it, but still.
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:42:14
Others want to know as well.
@_date: 2013-07-07 17:09:29
Probably. But yeah, BOO OBAMA! VOTE REPUBLICAN GUISE!
@_date: 2013-07-02 12:15:52
Would it be feasible for governments to collude and do exactly that once bitcoin becomes large enough? And would that be a bad thing? /bcnooob
@_date: 2013-07-07 16:49:50
You mean Bush. What Bush did.
@_date: 2013-07-07 16:57:50
What? No, the draconian measures that everyone is bitching about were instituted by Bush- NSA surveillance, economic collapse because of two illegal wars, Guantanamo. You don't just flick a switch and revert eight years of corruption and fascist policy.
