I get the comedy now.

I’m not in one camp or the other.
What’s comedic about scaling block sizes?

The Apple App Store and the success of the iPod was the primary driver of the iPhone’s success.
Techies like us care about components and specs.
Regular people care about features and apps.
To the real public at large, and Wall St, the iPhone is the first smart phone. Nobody cares that blackberry ran brick breaker and snake.

I think it’s important to not view ethereum as an alt coin.
It’s a software platform built on block chain technology, powered by crypto currency.

Which is a good thing.
Honest to goodness I was never able to keep a dollar in my pocket 10 years ago, no matter how much I made. I was one of those people.
Somehow BTC was my motivator to change. Not fixing my credit, not buying a house, not getting rich....
Whatever works I guess.

Define smartphone?
Not flip?
Color screen?
Touch screen?
What makes a phone smart if not for its software ecosystem and network capabilities?

If your workplace has O365 accounts and you use that in your personal phone, thy can enforce IT security policies on your device.
Some of these include disabling copy/paste and screenshots. Employees hate it.

To be fair, blame their managers and probably unrealistic expectations.

Nice hash miner is a great one for noobs.
It mines different alt cryptos in the background, and you get paid out in bitcoin, not ever having to worry about managing different mining apps, wallets, and exchange rates.
You could make a tiny bit more mining solo, but it comes with learning the tech.
As far as plug and play, click and go, nicehash is for the masses.

Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you FUCKING kidding me right now?
What 5 year old is willing to work/pay for education?
What fucking kindergarten student has the means to pay for private school?
What you’re actually saying to this man is that he should’ve had better luck on his genetic lottery ticket.
Just because you made some money on bitcoin doesn’t make you an economist. 
There’s nothing innate about you other than your innate autism.
Go fuck your self.

I wish I could upvote your first sentence fifty times.

It could be argued that the iPhone was the first real smart phone.
It was the first mobile device with a healthy,  library of 3rd party apps.

Setup a wallet at your leisure. Whatever works for you.
I suggest starting with something easy like Coinbase. I also know people here hate it but the normies I converted prefer it because it’s a US operation and the owner was interviewed in the news.
Download and install nicehash miner, by clicking Sell on Nicehash.com, then CPU/GPU. Then that page should have a download link.
If you have an AMD GPU in your PC you’ll need the legacy version.
Once installed paste your wallet address in the app and click GO.
Easiest point and click method there is. Now the catch.
Nicehash is using your PC to mine altcoins. They get zcash, ether, and lite coin and then pay you for the trouble in bitcoin.
They probably aren’t giving you a fair amount, and calculating what you’re missing gets complicated.
You could make more operating the mining software from the command line, and joining your rig to a mining pool, then selling those alrcoins for bitcoins, but that gets technical and a bit investments/markety.
So that’s the trade off, but I think it’s worth it to effectively “mine bitcoins” at home. Aka get paid in bitcoin to mine altcoin for someone else.
If any other new bitcoiners find this useful, feel free to tip.

He just listed numerous big time influencers and you have the gaul to say nobody influential supports BCH.

Does your workplace have Office 365?
If so, do you have any of those apps on your phone?

I’m sure you know better than the actual Chinese guy.

Check out nicehash. Seriously. It doesn’t have too much traction.m here but I’m currently making $9USD worth of bitcoin a day off two gaming PCs.
