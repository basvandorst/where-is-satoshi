Yes you are right, and we have system to prevent from bad and malicious codes.
The goal here is to use javascript in order to crypt the code before send it to the server, like this even if someone sniffed the submitted code, he can't do nothing with it.
With SSL too this will make a strong security.

Selling unused accounts like: Netflix, Localbitcoins, games, serial keys, programming codes, if you upload files on any plateform you can sell the links here etc ...

If you are trusted on any forum or website, you have to create a topic with a satoshibin link in order to sell something without been there.

Thank you for your suggestion.
We already planned to develop it more, and this with adding SSL Certificate, encrypt the code with javascript before sending it to server.

Then all upload pateforms, site like pastebin all designed for that purpose ? Designed especially to help peoples selling digital goods here:  ... the idea come from here.
@_date: 2016-07-31 16:15:21
No, is a website to sell digital goods with an easy way (Just with Copy Paste)
@_date: 2016-07-31 15:23:23
And we will do so, we are developping the website more in order to avoid any bad contents ... 
We are acting just like upload plateforms, but instead to let the users uploading any file, they paste directly the product on the website.
Even a free services like mediafire, sendspace, mega.nz ... have a problem like this.
