Thanks!  I'm not familiar with how that works, and I'll be looking into it.
The advantage to what I'm suggesting is that it would be automated, could be placed where there is electricity, &amp; an internet connection, and potentially private.
The last part is really what interests me the most.

I don't like Romney in the least..  He stands for nothing, and lies like politicians do.  He gets what he has coming to him as far as I'm concerned.  BUT, extorting money from anyone over personal information is shitty.  The fact that his ridiculous track record is less of an issue than his truly personal tax info for many is sad.

Where is the "violation" in defending your property?  I realize that the term "violence" can be used in many ways, but resisting violation/violence is hardly violence, and is certainly righteous.
Rights don't require force to exist.  The beautiful thing about BTCs is the authority/control over them is maintained by those who own them (for the most part).
[The state can never be righteous, and can only violate.](

I'm not entirely sure I know how to word this, but I'd like BTC to have a requirement for total number of not directly connected nodes, or servers..  Maybe some way to go into stasis for 48 hours or so, if a certain % of connections were lost suddenly.  Require connections in a third of the worlds time zones..
My hope is that it would require a very large, as-close-to global (and adapt to be someday, hopefully, extraterrestrial), group effort, to destroy BTC, and make it less susceptible to some sort of blitz attack.  I assume this might be impossible, and could make startup difficult.  However, as a non-technically affluent person, I can dream.  :)

It would only take few willing to provide access to others.
On another note, it may take a community that doesn't have access to other money to start using BTC as their money, rather than just a transferring mechanism.

People finally realizing that Bitcoin is a superior currency than the FRNs is exactly the type of "emergency" that I'm afraid the government had in mind when it gave itself the Unconstitutional authority to shut down the internet.  I had no hope that BTC's integrity would be able survive the governments of the world disconnecting enough people from the chain in order to hijack it.  I'd like to hear that it could.
Here is my pretty technically incompetent [comment from a while ago](
@_date: 2012-01-02 21:36:58
The weakness (&amp; a strength) of such a device would be that it's stationary, and subject to force, and observation for intel collecting.  Unlike a cash ATM, I'd assume these devices would have very little cash in them (though I'm not sure what kind of security their could be over the BTC sending if the device was compromised) as cash isn't the product.. they'd only contain money used to make the purchase between emptying.
I was not thinking of anything like the Bitcoin Bills, or whatever they are called, as I am unfamiliar with how that would work.  I was thinking of it more as a sending station where one could deposit a $20 bill in, and send however many BTCs that would purchase to any address s/he wished.  Perhaps it could offer a receipt with the BTC transaction info.
I would think that a device like this would amplify the growth of BTC use greatly, assuming the implementation of them could be successful before the state hindered them too greatly.  I imagined trials for such a device in video game arcades, if there are any of them left, with some transaction size limit in case they're faulty.  Not only would an arcade operator be familiar with that kind of business arrangement, but I'd think that it would make such a device seem much less threatening to the state...  I would hope that devices like these could be used to transact with tremendous privacy, with only the location of the transaction recorded, and the BTC addresses involved.  Once I had faith in the operation of such devices, I'd love to see them at convenience stores, ATM booths, etc.
Even if they were relatively short lived, I think it would have a tremendous impact on the use of BTCs.  Getting banks, and other intel hubs, out of the way of purchasing would be great!
Edit:  Now that I think of it, a gift card vending machine that sold game credit, iTunes/Amazon credit, etc, and that could also sell Linden Dollars, WOW, PLEX, or any other "virtual currency", that looked more like an arcade game itself, might be ideal way to implement something like this.

This is a market opportunity.  Someone like you, who sees any opportunity to go there and buy BTCs back cheap, until you have competition.  Then either get out, or buy them back at more competitive rates.
Ideally, they'd just use BTCs.

This sucks..  I didn't read very far into this, but I will say both that if I received that accidental transfer, I'd return it, however threatening me with legal nonsense would be the absolute wrong way to approach me about it, and really make it hard for me to help you rectify your expensive error.  What a poor strategy..
Having said all that, it sucks that it looks like a lot of peoples' BTC were lost.  Be careful with yours, people.

"Not exactly the same, but they are both depriving someone of their property, which is theft."
Though he did not take it through force, or fraud, I believe he is guilty of something.  Not sure I'd call it theft, but I can live it, as long as people don't pretend that force/fraud was part of this equation.
"Not only is it the law, but in my view, and I suspect most people's views, it is morally correct in addition to being legally correct."
I wouldn't be surprised if BTCs weren't recognized as property, or currency, but more a form of entertainment, or something else (a meaningless score, in a meaningless game, such as karma on reddit), and you were wrong about the "law" part.  At first I agreed about the recipient being morally wrong *under these circumstances*...  I still may feel this way, but I find the person responsible for all of this guilty of worse..  Not only did he jeopardize the wealth of others (I assume he has, or will, make them whole), but his "suggestion" to the recipient was ill conceived from the start.  It's hard for me to not feel like he, and those who trusted him, got what the deserved.
Having said all of this, were I the recipient, &amp; it were 5 BTC, I'd probably say GFY, and to take responsibility for your actions.  That it's such a wealth of BTC, and it obviously wasn't the property of the flake who lost it, but the result of the investment of many, I'd return it.
What people who intend on using BTC going forward should take most from this is that trust is earned.  If you misplace it, you've failed.  BTC is what it is, and it'll either work for you, or it won't.
"Ownership cannot be transferred by accident, it must be a voluntary act."
Not with BTC.  Accept it.
"Similarly, if I hold a gun to your head and force you to send me your Bitcoins, I do not then own them, because it was not a voluntary act on your part."
Similarly?  I can't believe you actually believe this.  One includes force/fraud, the other doesn't.

Wouldn't the easiest way for a government to control Bitcoin be to just buy as many as possible?  I realize that if they didn't buy them all, people could still trade in small fractions, but I'd think if they just bought everything that was for sale, they'd likely, eventually, depress the computer power they'd have to go up against.

Taking someone else's property without their consent.
Edit:  The way I see it, if you could literally be dead, and someone else lose their property like this, you didn't steal anything.  That it was an obvious mistake that they were sent to him, and he didn't return them, makes him a shithead that I'd never knowingly interact with.
This is the nature, and value, or BTC. It's secure, and "final".  This was a very expensive mistake, and I hope people avoid both the "caretaker" of the BTCs, and the guy that received them.

"Which is precisely what BenDavis did."
Not returning is not the same as taking.  Though he is definitely in the wrong to keep them.
"The law really is clear on this subject. If someone else's property falls into your hands, even as a result of a mistake on their part, it is still their property and you are stealing it if you refuse to give it back."
I couldn't care less about statute, and that something is statute is far from evidence of it being correct.  Everyone knows that returning someone's property under these circumstances is the right thing to do.  This person is wrong to keep it, but he didn't take it.
"Its "final" in the sense that there is no way to involuntarily reverse a transaction, but that is a separate issue to the legal matter of who owns the bitcoins."
I  agree that it's separate, but my point is that "legality" is irrelevant.  "Legality", &amp; BTCs, have almost nothing to do with one another.  You're wasting your time, imho, considering such things.  Also, the point that what BenDavis did wasn't "take", which is basically semantics, and not all that important to me (although it does seem silly to me when some insist that he took something, rather than not return, which doesn't appear to be what you're saying), as he is in the wrong either way which has been my point.  Society of BTC users will have to figure out how to protect themselves from the unscrupulous, and incompetent.
BTC use isn't for everyone.  Those who don't understand the reality of BTCs should stick with other options.  There won't be any "official" help in these matters without an evolution of humanity towards freedom.  The state uses money to control, &amp; dominate.  BTCs could theoretically take this ability away.  It doesn't matter how much better BTCs are as a currency, or how much better off humanity would be with it..  There is no rational, righteous, reasoning that will suddenly get the statists to happily accept the loss of their ability to inflate at will, as their interest is dominion.  If BTC users want to pretend like their analogies of car theft, etc., are relevant, they're wrong.  BTCs are unique in that other than someone actually having them stolen, i.e, someone using force or fraud, the owner of the BTC has absolute control over them.  There is no other authority.  The sooner people start appealing to the state to set some precedence, which is just trying to figure out the right approach to eliminate BTCs, the sooner people give them their pretense for doing so.
The reason I mention it is this...  What makes BTC special isn't how useful it is, because some state could replicate that if they wished, while keeping control.  It's the power/theft it prevents, and maintains for an owner, as a truly market driven currency.  There is almost no example of the potential true ownership of property that compares to it.  If you want to start discussing BTCs in terms of what someone else can force you to do with them... well, go ahead.  However, that's seems to be beside the most important point of BTC.  My suggestion would be to take responsibility for your actions as though you were a free, independent, person, or return to the protected, nanny state, options.

I have a couple questions..  One; I thought that it wasn't simply a matter of having a majority of the computational power that would allow someone to control the chain, as the nature of chain itself would make it exponentially easier to maintain integrity, vs corrupt it..  Is this not the case?
Two; how could this be prevented?  It seems to me that this opens the door for a competitive currency that would somehow prevent this.  Might a currency be better off if every client was rewarded, one at a time, until all of them were?  Or maybe divide the reward among every active node every time? Would this eliminate the centralization for sharing? It would be a lot less computational power, but if it protected against this risk, it might be worth it. Maybe if every client had a delay in the ability to transact equal to the amount of time they were offline after initial startup?  Any ideas?
I hope that those who are selling the hardware stipulate that their devices aren't to be used these in groups larger than 10%, or so.
I don't know how these groups are made up exactly, but I hope there is no where near 50% owned by one, or even a few owners, within the boundaries of a single government jurisdiction.  It doesn't take much imagination to see it stolen.

BTCs are a medium of exchange.  They're valued because of their permanence, the control afforded the true owner, and the ability to exchange them from anywhere to anywhere.
I love bitcoins...  It's a brilliant technology that I think will do more for humanity that most people could imagine.  I do wish people who use them would consider a few things, though, and change their perspective a bit.
1, I wish the term "coin" wasn't attached to it at all.  "Coining" is something states do.  For example, if you have a gold coin, you have state issued money. If it's essentially the same thing, but without the numismatic value, or state endorsement, it's called a "round".  Anyone can trade metal however they wish..  they can be rounds, bars, flakes, etc..  The greatest attribute Bitcoins have is their complete disassociation from the state.  When governments here "coin", they think their territory.  It's really a slight thing, but whatever.  If I created them, I might have framed them as some universal video game point, or something innocuous.  If I were going to be so bold as to call it what it is, a currency, I wouldn't have included "coin".  It's done, and it's almost of no importance now because it long hasn't been under the radar.
2, if I never hear anyone ever say that they "buy", "sell", or "purchase", *with* bitcoins, I'd dance a jig!  You have property that you exchange/gift/etc. for other property.
3, Some people are so stuck in their old school paradigm that they insist on trying to twist the dynamic beauty, freedom, and utility, of bitcoins, to fit the control, simplicity, or tangibility, of government enforced legal tender.  They seem to want banks, notes, government endorsement, etc., when they're not only totally unnecessary, but can only make bitcoins less than what they are.
I'm sure I have others, but I can't think of them at the moment.  If there is one point I wish people would understand, it's this; The more you try to involve government with bitcoins, the sooner they will destroy it.  The more you do the opposite, the more valuable they'll be.
