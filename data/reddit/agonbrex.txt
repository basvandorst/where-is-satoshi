it’s exactly in time like this that we need to remind ourselves that we are holding bitcoin to change the financial system. HODL through muddy waters

i agree with you and i personally think we should all focus on long term scenario (10years from now). Probably people who DCA now will be future millionnaires.

tbh everything regarding tech side should be in this sub, whereas posts about price should be in bitcoinmarkets

i know this is the question all of us are trying to answer, but realistically speaking, what do you think the value will be in 2018? some people say, 15k, some 50k and some 100K or even more. And, is it stupid to believe that around 2023/2025 the value might touch 1M? i am still a noob so i am eager to hear your opinions
