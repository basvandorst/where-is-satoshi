The northern wall was erected at 11500 largely in a single motion about two nights ago. Once that is finally taken, then you might see a  pretty quick sweep upwards as the momentum carries.

Kodak is still headquartered in Rochester, NY, as always. They are, however, a leaner enterprise these days. They've mostly moved on completely from film (although Tarantino has them still making some film for Hollywood).

Republicans and necons LOVE big government. Bush increased government spending more than any other recent president. It's just that different administrations have different priorities.

All this does is lead my mind to the giant in Twin Peaks. I'm not sure that was the intended meme though....
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:29:10
From what GDAX shows, probably not. There are some sellers selling at the current price and pushing it down, but there very little behind that to stop things from reversing course.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:10:56
Wasn't that last week's news?
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:41:32
From what I saw, a few whales aggressively influenced the market within the last 24 hours, perhaps to get ahead of
segwit implementation and what I'd guess would be positive market gains. The rest is sort of the typical sheep reaction to that sell off because of momentum.

They put it back again, higher up the chain, same amount.
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:04:26
Doesn't look like it was a real wall (started around 7820), just someone trying to influence the market. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:28:41
One way or another, it always seems that things tend to move this time of day (by 1am GMT). Volume is going up though, which may help sustain gains.

It's been around for a few months now (surprised that it hasn't been posted before). It's actually from the Seth Meyers show.

You mean the two times that it's gotten close since January? There's nothing really magical about a high from a particular moment on a random day in January. There has been a slow up swing the past three weeks (following a serious drop a few weeks back), with the inevitable dips. Eventually, it will be above 11.7, as I'm sure you know; then we'll have another number to eye.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:24:07
Yeah. I don't think we'll see as quite a rise as last week, but it's safe to say we'll have a good start to the week; I just hope it holds through to next weekend.
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:51:41
Always better to buy the dips then when it's cresting.
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:14:18
While generating profits, bots mostly create equilibrium; they produce profit at practically any price. Market demand is behind real movement in either direction.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:18:21
...except for when you think it's about to dip but then goes the other way. You can't reliably predict this things. There are patterns that cause responses from traders, but it isn't that simple, and it certainly does go up after it's been flat for some time. Honestly, one thing that does show which direction things might go is whether there is low order volume ahead or behind for about $100 to $200. That usually is too attractive for someone with a lot of coin. Resistance builds up in either direction either from those trying to day trade or from those who were looking to either get in or get out at a better price and who have gone in on an order.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:06:01
Do what makes sense for you and your portfolio. I hope that you're a long time investor who has been through the highs and dips before. Panic selling a few hours after a high usually leads to regrets.
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:16:16
You're complaining about $30? That's like 2 minutes on GDAX.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:18:12
The dips will get bigger as it goes up, that's natural. It takes a steady hand. And yes, when we see more steady, slower growth, that's a better sign to me than a quick spirt. If I had some money to go, I'd put a little in now that it's under 10.7 then wait before investing anything more.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:39:25
Yeah, it's what they do. I doubt it will be as successful on a Monday.
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:11:34
You're right. It hasn't. It was under 900 just a day ago. According to their "Bitcoin" twitter propagandist, they did have some good new over the past 24 hours (this would be one of the few tweets that wasn't simply calling Bitcoin a corporate scam [project much Roger?] and actually reporting news); perhaps Newegg merchants are excited or something like that.
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:32:06
Whales go in whales go out. Long term, the market reacts to public sentiment and hype--that's what kept things off for weeks. We're better off with a little fluctuation and dip then straight up, day after day. That said, people are getting better educated, and there's no need for us to see a repeat at the level of January, but more of something along the lines of the fluctuations of the past. I'm pretty optimistic.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:37:07
It is. Just a bunch a mumble jumble--especially when anyone gets specific with a long term forecast. The lines for the last 14 days on GDAX show steady growth, but this guy has the "technical analysis."
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:01:14
It's market reaction and uncertainty no doubt. Mt. Gox is said to be cooling, at least until the fall. If there is another volcano day, it won't be until late September, as far as I've read.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:00:00
Why not? Seems like a really good entry point all things considered, especially if you don't need out right away.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:20:23
I'm pretty new to the game, but the history of Bitcoin has shown just the opposite with every crash. That doesn't mean that they'll be smooth sailing or the moon... just that I'd be happy seeing around 10900 going into Monday.
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:42:10
Don't wait too long; the market pattern has changed and lots of buys are ready to go. We're still in an upwards cycle and probably will be for some time. Fluctuations on the weekends don't mean as much either.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:25:56
Well, today, as a whole, has given us the longest time in the 8ks since last year, as far as I've charted. Luckily we don't usually stay at these lows for that long (the bad news being that we went sideways much of last week). I'd like to see a slow, but determined rise upwards for a while.
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:22:15
Should be a good chance to buy some in the gap. There was a lot of push down at 11.2, so I don't imagine it won't be long before they push it back up, surprised that they got as much out of it as they did.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:09:39
That's sound for you. It's the people who bought in this morning and who are freaking out because of some volatility and sell five hours later that will ask themselves what they did later. I've seen it.
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:03:34
Well, we've already had the 50% crash and are in an upswing, so he/she either didn't buy when they wanted to or, more likely, they're just trolling along with their comrades. Take your profits? lol. Notice what they wrote a few weeks ago "Get out of Bitcoin and get into stocks." It's a theme.
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:10:41
A nice slow, steady rise of five green candles the past seven days... To me, it seems a great time to HODL. However, the good news is that you can get back on the train at 11k in a few days and not have lost as much earnings. I'm liking this better than Nov/Dec.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:35:44
Next stop $10,441.10 (quite a random place to pitch a wall)...

A whale doesn't want it to stay there. Quite a little war between generals.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:06:49
I see that now. Their comment history seems to fluctuate from it's the end-of-the-world! Bitcoin to 1k! one day to the occasional suggestion to buy like crazy. If that's not trolling, it certainly seems to suggest that this poster is on a different astral plane. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:38:03
Some people like to see some sign of health before buying though. It's fine to buy now, as long as you don't put everything in during the climb (and it was good if you had a chance to buy the dip too). I feel that it's best to buy in stages. The more volume, the harder it is for whales to create greater volatility, but I agree that whales often like it when people react quickly or predictably.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:55:28
Spurred on by whales (note the transactions of over 50 btc that just went through). There's a good chance that it will level out soon (and they'll buy back in), but who knows.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:57:09
Relax... Take a deep breath.

I love how he denies that he runs the Bitcoin Twitter account but then posts in the exact same language and tone that propaganda mill uses: "

Okay. But you did write earlier that you switch from "moon" to "bitcoin is going to zero" for lolz, so I'd surprised if you don't wear the "troll" label with a certain amount of pride.
