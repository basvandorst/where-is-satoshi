I have read plenty, and like I said before, none of it has proven it has a use case.

You don't trade stocks for pizza. How is it a value store and a currency at the same time? It can't be both because it isn't stable enough. That pizza you purchased is instantly more expensive or cheaper in a matter of seconds. How many times have you missed out on $100 after buying a pizza? Never.
Just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean they won't.  If they sell off all their coins then attack the network, they could destroy entire economies in an act of war.

So you honestly believe every strong economy in the world is going to collapse to the point bitcoin is the only valued currency?

Point taken.

 I genuinely don't understand why so many believe this has value to the extent it has currently.

I'm asking because this coin was signed with a doom and gloom message on its first transaction and has taken a revolutionary frame from its inception. It's also the reason a lot of people purchase it and is frequently echoed throughout this sub.

If you honestly believe bitcoin is the future, why wouldn't you convince someone whose asking genuine questions about it?
That doesn't make sense.

Donations made to politicians are public. We already know who is giving them money.
So what's the difference between reading it outright and searching for it on the blockchain?
