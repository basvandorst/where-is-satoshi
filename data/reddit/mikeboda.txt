Receiving payment is another visible activity that would raise flags that would easily reveal you in a society with public returns.
If you spending or receiving payment in a country, that country probably isn't taxing you.

[Libertarianism is left-wing](  is a misnomer.  Their politics oppose what libertarian means in most of the world and has meant everywhere for nearly all of history from the industrial revolution onwards.  Reactionary free-market politics can better be called proprietarianism or neo-liberalism.  Progressive free-market politics can better be called mutualism.

Finland makes all tax returns public.  
The rich would not be able to engage in any large scale tax fraud if all returns were available online for anyone to read.  You couldn't actually spend any of your untaxed money on anything worth having.  You buy a company?  Your competitors and employees will look up your taxes returns and expose your fraud.  You buy a mansion?  Your neighbors will find out.

I'm not talking about problems with pricing.  I'm talking about the problem that the amount of wealth you hold in a finite nominal amount of bitcoin increases relative to the cost of real goods and services over time.  That means you have an incentive to save/horde rather than spend.

Communism implies a stateless, monneyless, and classless society, not a republic, and not a society with markets.
Bitcoin could be a tool to undermine the state and capitalism, but it wouldn't be used for the real economy under full communism.

I'm to the left of you in that I am a member of a real world anarchist-communist organization.
I support pseudonymous digital currency for technical and pragmatic reasons.  
While I understand the rich will use it to evade taxes*, trade in goods and services sourced via exploitation, etc horrible things, I also know that revolutionaries will use bitcoin to finance anti-capitalist terrorist organizations, build strike funds, launder expropriations, etc.
Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them!
I have no love for deflationary currencies, as they lead to deflationary spirals.  I don't see bitcoin actually functioning as the dominant currency in any major economy.  Hell, I aim for an economy without any large scale trade at all.  
Bitcoin is simply a powerful tool.  It is not the basis for a new economic system.
*There is actually an easy [fix to this problem](

The only major social programs in the US are Social Security and Medicare, which are more like insurance policies or public pensions than real socialized benefits.  The taxes to fund Social Security are quite regressive: the rich pay a far lower percent of their income than the working class.
The US has big public spending because of law enforcement/prisons and the military.  The US is a powerful authoritarian state.
What European country is more authoritarian?  Belarus and Russia look like they have more authoritarian culture, but when you actually observe the prison population relative to the free population, they look more more libertarian than the US.

[Coercion can definitely buy you technical skill](  Violence could easily be used to force mathematicians to work for you and potentially discover flaws in algorithms and implementations, faster ways of generating cracks, etc.  Plus, there's good old [rubber-hose cryptanalysis](

Why would you use bitcoin if you want to avoid a deflationary currency?

Federal minimum wage legally applies to all states.  However, owners regularly engage in wage theft and the state supports the capitalist class so it does not arrest them.

All [libertarians]( are anti-capitalist.

There is nothing [libertarian]( about the US "Libertarian" Party.
