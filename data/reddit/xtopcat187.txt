I’ve seen that a lot of people create paper wallets that way. It’s probably safe, but why risk it? Just make another copy by hand and there is absolutely zero chance your seed has been exposed.

It’s strange you would buy one without researching it first? 
Look on YouTube for numerous guides on how to get started and set everything up. It’s very straight forward. Make sure you write down your recovery phrase and keep it in a safe place. Never take a photo of it or store it electronically in any format, ever.
It’s worth transferring a small amount of funds and resetting the wallet, then restoring it from the backup phrase. That way you know 100% your backup is good.

Yes. There was over 12,000 on post only sell orders within an hour. If GDAX let them through and didn’t clear off all the orders, the price would have dropped to absolute zero.

Yes please!

To all you Americans who can dump at this price I hate you. �� EUR market seems to not be working.

Debit card
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:03:59
0.0264 for £100? That's £3787 per coin. Do you just use it to withdraw as that seems crazy expensive ?
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:19:48
Thanks, I'll take a look at that!

Are there any exchanges that use gbp with better rate than Coinbase ?
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:13:21
There are no UK exchanges that allow you to withdraw to a UK bank account in GBP. They only allow Sepa transfers in EUR. After you get hit with exchange rate fees you get hit with a hefty processing fee from the bank. That's if you can manage to get through the verification process.
Local bitcoins makes it difficult to sell large amounts.
Bitcoin ATMs have ridiculous fees.
What I would like is for exchanges to accept Uk bank transfers for deposits instead of a flat 4% fee by credit / debit card, along with UK bank transfer withdrawals to get rid of all this other faffing about.

I'm not planning to sell. If there's anything I've learned from this sub it's to HODL. I'm just looking into ways that I 'could' sell. So far it appears incredibly complicated to liquidate. Why exchanges don't accept UK wires I'm struggling to understand.

I read that in their voices and it made me lol

Delta and Blockfolio are really good for iOS. You have to type in your transactions though.

There certainly is. Go on to gdax, which is Coinbase’ exchange. You can log in and transfer your Coinbase deposit straight over. If you buy using a market order there is a 0.25% fee, if you use a limit order there is 0% fee.
Withdrawing from gdax also has no transaction (mining) fee.

That’s just your balance in fiat it should show your btc balance next to it.

The default is bits, if you go to currency settings you can change it to BTC.

I was a whisker away from putting all my BTC into Coinbase for the free coin earlier today. Glad I didn’t bother! RIP free coin. This outcome is much better though. Victory!

I use both. Send EUR to fire.com, send that to Revolut (no fee). Exchange it for GBP (best exchange rate). Withdraw to GBP bank. (no fee). You can withdraw from fire straight to your bank, but the exchange rate isn't very good.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:34:13
You can't unfortunately. You can't deposit to the exchange directly either. That's why fire.com is a good middle man. If you don't want to take advantage of revoluts better exchange rate they can be left out. (~2%)

I've been testing buying in GBP with little to no fee. Here is my first successful purchase with a 0.25% fee. Yes I know gdax market rate is usually higher than other exchanges, but I'm still surprised they use such a high sat/byte fee out of their pocket.
