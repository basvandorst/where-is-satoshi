\^youtube series of a guy following the above tutorial
To your question: I've got a 1TB external HD attached to the pi.
I'm currently setting mine up now as per the tutorial. It's pretty basic UI, but if you follow the directions, it ain't hard. Mine is syncing now, and I think I underestimated how long it's going to take. Could be days/weeks, IDK.
 BUT, that's the price to pay for independently verifying things yourself. Also, hardware was like, $150 or less, the amazing shopping list is in the tutorial. 
Sure, no major monetary rewards for running a node, but $150 was peanuts considering how much entertainment and educational value I've gotten out of this project so far. That, and the whole ind. verification thing once it's synced and running.
