What does this mean for people who use other clients, like Armory or Electrum?

It doesn't cost them anything until they sell their bitcoins at a loss.

What is the easiest way for me, an Australian, to buy Bitcoins, from my computer, right now?

Congratulations on making all that money OP.
Also, I have back problems and I never got anything for reading your post. You owe me some of those profits.

Damn it, I want someone to tip me $400.

Thanks. I suppose that part did come off a bit wanky didn't it?
Happy cakeday, by the way!

Calm down guys. They're all really interested in Bitcoin but they don't trust it because it's internet drug money.
This way they can get into it without risking their own money.

This just serves as another reminder: NEVER INVEST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

No thanks, Stallman is an idiot.

I'm going to have to disagree with you on this. The exchange rate was up around the lofty $1000 mark for more than a week. This "crash" that everyone is talking about happened within 24 hours, sure, but the point I am trying to make with my post is that you have to look at it in the long-term.
The people who bought BTC around the $1000 point and are selling now are making a mistake. Did they expect the price to double overnight?

Screw these guys, they still owe me $200.

What if I'm using a different client like MultiBit?
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:27:28
Read the edit and calm down dude.

Try LocalBitcoins.com. You pay a little more but you get them almost straight away and honestly with the way the price is rising at the moment you've made your money back within a few hours.
