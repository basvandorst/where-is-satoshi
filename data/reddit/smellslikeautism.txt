These kinds of posts tell me there are still so many people in denial and emotionally attached to Segwit/LN. If this post sums up your world view, you are likely overinvested in these two things, both financially and emotionally. If neither one gets adopted in a significant way, you can count on your investment slowly declining and being surpassed by every other superior coin out there. That has to be a scary thought. Diversify now.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:30:47
Never had a problem with Coinbase or GDAX that they didn't make an honest effort to fix. Just saying, seems there is a lot of hate for them around here since they aren't licking the anuses of the devs/blockstream and immediately rushing to adopt segwit or LN. Maybe the devs should have compromised a bit more with the block size and your venom should be directed at the devs instead.

Something tells me it's been around longer than you have.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:10:27
I think you overestimate the effect that dust has on a large brokerage/exchange like Coinbase/GDAX. It sounds great if one is looking for reasons to support Segwit and LN, but to most unbiased people, it really sounds like you are grasping at straws.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:45:12
It is not better. It's just been around longer and has more credibility. That is changing though since its use as a currency is failing right now.  
Look at fiat. It was and is considered the standard. Is it better than cryptocurrency? Hardly! But it is still more credible in many people's eyes. That is changing slowly, just like Bitcoin is losing credibility slowly (compared to more efficient altcoins out there right now).

Or you could just raise the block size limit with a few lines of code. You know, even temporarily.

I have avoided hardware wallets in general because of concerns like these that pop up, which, as a lay person, I have no idea how to guard against.  
For years I have had a copy of bitaddress.org saved on a USB drive. I trust that it is safe because at the time, a bunch of unknown people on the internet told me the code was open source and audited. I read this enough times and took the plunge. My keys have been secure ever since, but if the creator of the code is pulling a long con, I would be totally susceptible to it.  
In your opinion, assuming bitaddress.org is safe, do you think paper wallets generated from that code (on an offline pc that has never been connected to the internet) are safer than hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor?  
EDIT: bitaddress.org, not .net... sorry.

This is such horseshit. Either it's out or it's not. Either it gets adopted or it doesn't. If you have to pussyfoot around language like this so everyone is confused and wondering why they can't send any BTC without a ton of fees, guess what... it ain't out.

This is such a bullshit answer. Lay people do not need to be programmers in order to convey a message that something is broken.  
Imagine if you walked into your local mechanic's shop and told him your brakes were making a grinding noise. Instead of changing the rotors, he suggests that you are welcome to purchase a CAD workstation and re-engineer the inner workings of the brake calipers and a bunch of other bullshit which is someone else's job.  So much deflection... why?

Kinda disappointed I had to scroll down this far to see this. People forget how shitty Gox was back in the day.

I think it happens at an accelerating rate. Block Explorer announced today that they will refer to BTC as "Bitcoin Legacy." Coinbase will likely do the same, and if a few more players begin to do it, the dominos fall rapidly.  
It's up to the devs how long they want to let the ship sink though. A few lines of code and a little less greediness would go a long way to prevent it from happening.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:56:06
This is such a bullshit hypothetical. Nobody knows what the value of Bitcoin would be without alts because it was never that way (after the first one was created), nor will it ever be. You might as well speculate what the value of Bitcoin would be if Satoshi was never born, or if Gox didn't collapse. It's nonsense.

I doubt it, but it will survive. This is a boom right now. Crypto in general is not going anywhere and if your altcoin has even the slightest innovation or benefit, it means someone will mine and trade your coin hoping to get rich off it. Look at ETC.

It doesn't have to. Every time I hear the IBM commercial that casually mentions "blockchain technology" I am reminded of this. Cryptocurrency enables so many different blockchain-based entities to thrive, and even if the money doesn't ultimately end up in Bitcoin, there is enough of it pouring into alt coins and startups that enough of it will end up in Bitcoin as a store of value, at a minimum. This is a drop in the bucket what we are seeing right now. A speed bump in a long line of future boom and bust cycles.

It is a psychological thing. You just have to get over it. Understand that by abstaining from purchasing any at all because you can't afford a "whole" one, you could be cheating yourself of long term gains.if you bought 0.15 BTC back in 2012 it would have cost you 8 or 9 US dollars.  Today that is worth well over $2,000. Just buy what you can afford to lose.  
EDIT: I didn't check a chart but if memory serves me right it was about $14 a coin in late 2012... my math is wrong.  It would have cost much less than  $9... the point is the same.

Dumbest thing I have ever heard. What a narrowminded view. The calls for a scaling solution are loud and can be seen and heard everywhere. It is not the end user's job to determine the solution to why they have to pay high fees. They are not programmers. But it is the programmer's job to hear those complaints and determine how to fix the problem. 
This guy sounds like he would make an awful troubleshooter.  
Imagine taking your car to a mechanic and the mechanic refuses to install new brake rotors because you fail to explicitly request new brake rotors.

You've been in the community a month. I have been in BTC since 2012. The price does not matter to me, but I am concerned over the devs lack of response to a network that is unusable and can be immediately fixed with a soft fork. Everyone is looking for scapegoats like BCH or Coinbase which are just symptoms but not the actual problem.  
IDGAF if the price drops to $100 or rises to $100,000.  I will still be in the green. We will lose to another coin that is functional if something doesn't change. We will lose despite being able to prevent it from happening, and refusing to do so. That is the part that pisses me off.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:31:59
In short, you don't need to be online, and you can send BTC to a cold storage address you have used in the past. 
 
As far as the two transactions, let's say you had 5 BTC and you wanted to send some of it to your cold storage. But you only want to send 3 BTC there. When you create the transaction, there are actually two transactions being created. 3 BTC go to your cold storage, and 2 get send back to yourself as change. In electrum, for example, these are known as "change addresses" and you can see a list of them in the addresses tab. I do not know how other wallets deal with them, if they are easily visible, etc. Most people don't care about change addresses as long as the balance appears in their wallet, and they don't need to know about them in order to use the protocol, for the most part.  
You can reuse addresses to receive BTC, but best practice is to use a new address each time you receive. It has something to do with security and better anonymity but beyond that I am not sure. I am by no means an expert but I have been using Bitcoin for several years and am just weighing in. Someone more familiar with the backend, change addresses and cryptography can correct me where I am imprecise or wrong.

I would wait for it to stabilize for a while. There are always a few dead cat bounces, but if your plan is to HODL for a long time, 13000 is as good as 5000 which is as good as 19000. It won't matter when it is 1,000,000 per coin.

Get off my lawn! Not just millenials though. It can upset the status quo for impoverished countries, different races and ethnicities that are stuck in a certain income bracket or societal class.

With Electrum and Armory, you can generate a seed (random words) that you simply write down. You can delete the program if you want, come back to it decades later, enter the seed, and your coins will be inside your wallet. 
Just avoid importing private keys, as I believe only the deterministic addresses that come with your wallet are restored.

Interesting idea. I have never heard this before. Why do you think cryptocurrency as a whole will fail? That is a pretty sweeping condemnation and implies there will ultimately be no value in any of it, which means nobody will own any, or mine any, ever again.  This is a hard conclusion to come to but I am curious how you reach it.
And whatever technology replaces cryptocurrency, what characteristics do you think it will have? Or are you saying the current generation of crypto will be displaced by more advanced crypto?

There is always a ripple effect if there is a selloff.  In an effort to protect the value of an investment during a correction/crash, many people sell and attempt to buy back in at a lower price. Catching a falling knife is rarely smart, but that doesn't mean many people won't do it. In many cases, a crash would trigger stop loss orders to kick in without the investor even knowing. These types of behaviors are totally unrelated to tether, aside from being triggered by its failure indirectly.

Those who HODL through this will be stronger because of it. Those who day trade may make a few bucks this time but it will eventually catch up with them, whether it is poor timing or the taxes.

Do you have a link to a successful transaction that has taken place where a 1 BTC brass casascius has sold for 2 BTC? I typically see them sell for 1.2 or less, less if it is ungraded. And over the years, the prices in BTC seem to be going down as fiat value has gone up. I think the ones you are referring to are the ones with the misspelled "CASACIUS" logo which were made in 2011 I believe.  
Honestly, peeling may not be a bad idea given all the forks that have occurred lately. Lots of hidden value on a cas coin, and too much counterparty risk if you sell to a private party IMO.

Nope. Buying cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, or any stock or security for that matter, and simply holding onto it does not trigger a taxable event. It's when you go to sell or exchange it that triggers the taxable event, assuming you have realized a gain in value. This is the IRS's position in the USA, but I am not sure where you live so check your local laws.  But this is one of the many reasons so many of us recommend HODLing instead of daytrading your crypto.  
That said, if you do find yourself trading or selling, you can import all your trades into Turbotax or give them to your accountant using this site:  I have been using them for years and it saves a ton of time.

Since 2012, I have been using coinbase with very few problems other than those created by government regulation (e.g. intrusive questions when making fiat withdrawals). I trust them. They are insured.  
During the same period of time, I have seen many complaints of both services. Those directed at Coinbase are usually from people who complain that the site went down causing them to miss a trade. The one time their code caused an actual trading problem, which was in June during an Ethereum flash crash, they reimbursed all affected.  
Blockchain's losses I have seen due to a random number generator problem several years ago, which is crazy to think about happening. I have used Blockchain's wallet on android and their web wallet. I will never do so again. I have seen too countless complaints from people who have lost coins using their web wallet. Just google it a bit. They have reimbursed people from what I understand, but they are not insured like coinbase is... and coinbase funds are insured up to $250,000 via the FDIC. They also insure against crypto loss if it is their fault (e.g. not due to malware or your own dumbass error). That means a lot to me.  
Both have reasonable security precautions available, and you should use them to the fullest extent (e.g. 2 factor authentication and whatever else is available.) A lot of losses have happened because of malware that compromises your computer, and failure to use 2FA which allows your account to get hijacked.
The downside with coinbase if you are in the USA is they were just ordered by the IRS to turn over tons of financial information about their customers. But if you pay your taxes (and I do), that shouldn't worry you. It comes with the territory of dealing with a legit exchange that follows US laws, and also enjoys its protections.
TL;DR Despite technical issues, I trust coinbase with my coins and dollars more than I would blockchain.info just based on history and insurance.

Eh I know you're getting upvotes and you wrote something inspirational there, but it really is bullshit, in part. If an exchange steals my coins, they are still liable to me. I never bought into "if you don't have your private key, you don't own your coins."  It's nonsense and there is a clear difference in the law between possession and ownership.  
If you think the valet owns your Tesla because you've handed him the keys, we would all call you fucking nuts. But for some reason when it is Bitcoin, everyone is so willing to victim-blame and throw their hands up in the air... until it happens to them.  Possession of keys is NOT ownership, whether the keys start a car or allow you to spend bitcoin. So fuck off with that logic. We can do better.

Since it's a somewhat symbiotic relationship, that is, the users drive the desire to develop, the user base can be said to "do all the important work." Because without the user, none of it would occur.  
With that understanding, realize that the developers will go where the users go. And the users will go where the money is.  
So stop making this a philosophical battle over right or wrong. Users will go where they can either make money, or spend their money. As a long term HODLER, I don't give a shit which coin allows me to do that. I owe no allegiance to either. Those of you calling out Andreas for not fighting your battle just don't understand the forces at work.

Anyone who is devoutly attached to one is either 1) a new enough investor that they don't know what the hell they're talking about, or 2) overinvested in that technology to the point that they dumped the other coin and are all in or close enough to all in that it would hurt them very much if the other coin failed.

ebay prices are artificially high due to the high ebay/Paypal fees and counterparty risk. And ebay is full of scammers and chargebacks so prices are higher to account for those risks. So the amount received is much lower than the sale price. Going rate on bitcointalk for a brass 1BTC casascius is like 1.2 BTC and falling as BTC gains value in USD.  
And you do need to peel it to redeem the forked coins unless you can find a buyer willing to incorporate that value into their offer. On bitcointalk, they haven't been... so to me it makes more sense to peel especially since there is no counterparty risk.

I read this as "bragged about his mom" which makes just as much sense here. OP, post your mom and we will give you more upvotes.

It is a bubble. In a series of bubbles. A series of bubbles that keep on popping and reinflating to highs previously unseen. If you look at the previous bubbles on a chart, they all look like tiny speed bumps now. However, if you lived through them, like I have, they all pretty much felt like this. And people asked the same questions that you and others are asking.

I think it happens when CME futures go live next month, the rocket takes off probably next week if they release an official date.

This does not sound like HODLing.  
If you HODL, you never lose. Just repeat that to yourself next time you get all itchy and stupid.

Eh... shut up. They are both relevant to Bitcoin and one is an actual fork.  Alt coin or not, I am not okay with making myself willfully blind to forks, threats to bitcoin, or relevant side topics. So you can fuck right off with your arrogance.

I don't think you understand what capital gains is. You must pay a higher rate of capital gains tax if you hold it less than a year. It is all still filed on your income tax return.

Nonsense. This is an English-speaking forum and the post contained broken English. This is not harassment by any definition of the word.

You haven't been paying attention or are intentionally blinding yourself to ETH. Which is it?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:31:25
Yes, because all of those were fake news stories.

Cool. Looks fake though.

Or it will attract enough attention on the way up that you could be completely wrong. Be honest. You have no fucking clue what is going to happen.

Example of someone who has fumbled through life, accidentally succeeding. When you come across someone like this, you have to just laugh and not view them as a threat, provided they never come into any power.

Bitcoin is untraceable? Where did this guy come from? @_date: 2017-10-10 08:14:24
You can't know this. It was floating around $100 in May 2013. In fact, your comment leads me to believe you were not invested back then.

To;dr: Satoshi invents trustless system to prove ownership and identity. Person claiming to be Satoshi refuses to use trustless system to prove ownership and identity. Then he demands that we trust him or else he will stomp his feet and go away.

Free market at work.  They are not too big to fail.  If they screw over enough of us, someone will replace them.  That simple.  (Note:  I am not saying they screwed over this guy.  But they have screwed over quite a few people recently.)
