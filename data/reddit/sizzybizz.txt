Gotcha. So soft forks are kind of like split testing? Like proof of concept to see how a code works? And to confirm we are operating on the same terms, what do you define as soft fork?

"misunderstanding fees' long-term purpose" - from a Core perspective, what is the LT purpose of fees?
"fragility of decentralization" - As outlined in the link below, I think this topic is simply different assessments for the cost/benefit of maintaining security/decentralization. If I can take that further, Core views compromising decentralization as the ultimate End-Game, thus providing justification for those with that view to protect this from happening via any means necessary. Whereas BU, does not see this as the End-Game, making their perceived cost of potentially compromising decentralization much lower, which then makes the benefits of bitcoin as a cryptocurrency in its usage and utility it provides to society, outweighing said costs. No?

ASIDE; It's a shame that his comments got deleted as it's doing a disservice to those attempting to inform themselves from all angles. If you've effectively countered his concerns, then that would be powerful for someone who is agnostic on the subject to see his concerns, your answers, become more informed, and draw their own conclusions, instead of "malevolent mods" authoritatively deciding what is wrong and dangerous to bitcoin. That very act is anti-bitcoin idealogy, and shunts the learning curve for those wanting to independently evaluate the information at hand.
RE: I'm sure this has been thought, but is there a way to create incentives for running a node (outside of it's value-add use case for competent bitcoin users)? If there were, and we knew active nodes would scale with increasing fees and blocksizes, would this be a viable solution? In other words, if segwit/LN works the way says they would, is Core able to implement alternative solutions that would maintain integrity of decentralization (more nodes) while increasing the usage of the bitcoin system with increased transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:10:35
so running a full node only serves you if youre adequate in coding? So how does someone who doesn't know shit about bitcoin effect the system? wouldn't that bog it down and make it harder to reach consensus and continue evolving bitcoin protocol/code?

Private libraries, hell ya! But as long as public, nah. Once Bitcoin becomes widely accepted, this could be a value add biz idea tho! Great thought

The Crux of the Argument; 
BU ideally seeks to grow block/node size at same pace that Moore's Law increases storage, with the assumption that the current # of nodes remains adequately decentralized. 
Core seeks to keep block/node size constant, so Moore's Law will outpace block/node size, decrease cost of running a node to enable more nodes, thus increasing decentralization.
BU sees cost of stagnation exceeding the benefits of growth/increased use of bitcoin. 
Core sees benefit of maintaining security of decentralized system exceeding the cost of slower verification, higher fees and thus wider use/growth of bitcoin.
Am I missing anything? **I can't sum up LN/segwit dispute, dont adequately understand them to sum up the argument

With transactions increasing, shouldn't blocksize increase to accommodate this? Memory and hard drive space is only continuing to evolve and get cheaper (Moore's Law), especially when storing using DNA, which was recently done successfully. You can argue that this would make it more expensive and beholden to "elite", however I believe more well intentioned people will possess nodes, and for "evil" elites to gather enough resources and collaborate doesn't seem feasible to me. Kinda like how all the components involved for the theories of conspiracy for 9/11 being an inside job. Anyway, anyone else feel similar on block size increasing, or have counters?

Is there a particular field of ignorance that you see as the biggest threat to Bitcoin? I understand it's complex making it difficult to explain, but simply stating that "we protect bitcoin from ignorance" without pointing out specific elements is where BU is deriving it's "malovelent dev" criticism from. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:17:16
If people aren't willing or capable to learn more, is there an effort to teach better? Or a resource that clearly explains the reasons why Bitcoin should not scale? 
Both sides have valid arguments, but it appears BU supporters are voicing legitimate concerns which aren't being adequately answered.

thanks for the suggestion! but it's not the password that is the issue, it was my transcribing of the private key. it says the format is not valid. so once i can see what is wrong with the format, then i can enter the password that i used.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:38:02
When I do that, it says the text I've entered isn't a valid Private Key. Despite it looking as though it is in the correct BIP38 encrypted format. I cannot figure it out idk that coding details to dive into potentially what is wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:32:58
I 100% misread a letter because what I transcribed was 58 characters. My goals was to see if there is a format to a Bip38 key that I could compare my privkey to so as to identify the error
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:39:39
definitely a bounty. i think it's a problem for a coder who know the guts of how the encryption works and can provide insight on what is wrong with the format. ie not enough capital letters, sequencing of text/numbers, etc.
