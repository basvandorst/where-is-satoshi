Bitfinex best platform for that but you need atleast minimum depo of $10k or crypto in order to trade there

I bought the big dip yesterday at bitfinex and now the btc is rising any thought if it will drop back?
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:12:43
i think there is a ups in downs in the market.while whales i think will be having hard time to manipulate the bitfinex because they have the largest volume in the market unless they have trillions of funds to do that
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:11:02
Don't know what happened to btc now but I sold it to buy other coins in bitfinex :D
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:16:04
In order to trade on bitfinex you need a min account equity 10K$ or more 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:44:04
Yeah I checked it on bitfinex chart 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:52:06
Agree for that!
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:11:11
i think tether is a promisiong one and it can be bought under bitfinex.if if is scam it will already gone right now.but look it helps in stabilizing the market
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:27:16
tether is gaining its ground now so better analyze now it is very critical to where to invest be safe have a better platform.me just watching it at bitfinex for any movement
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:34:40
i think bitfinex will stand its ground as others speculating that it will go down.it has the strongest platform and largest community.do you think what will happen if it close the largest volume they have we will back to the stone age ;)
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:46:26

@_date: 2018-01-04 15:32:09

@_date: 2018-01-17 15:19:56
in order to prevent from manipulation u need ist to study the market u are entering then select and analyze market platform that best suite u like bitfinex which have strong platform that is very difficult to manipulate because they have the largest digital currency in the world
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:03:47

@_date: 2018-01-16 16:55:57
Agree just hodl!
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:42:55
i think every seconds the amount of volume in the market changes dramatically so even bitfinex cannot give u exact amount of volume.but as far as trading is concern it is one or if the not the best tyrading flatform in cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:55:35
As a user I trust bitfinex having using this platform quite some time and I don't see or experience any problem with it.If you're an observer about whats happening today in the market actually tethers even help to maintain stability in the market.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:36:44

maybe u can ask the bitfinex support group. they are always there when you need them
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:40:18
i think tethers is gaining its ground in the market and people are trying investing on it and some are trying to pull it off.besides the amount of tethers help maintain the market at pace you can buy it at bitfinex and now because of it we are now seeing green buttons on the wall
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:40:31

@_date: 2018-01-17 16:35:51
So many people  are panic selling now because of the huge dip so far of bitcoin but for me for a year of experience in trading this is the sign of buy more if the hard dip would reach it. Im planning to invest more btc or ether in bitfinex for this situation well always watch the market time to time
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:09:17
You need to wait for january 15 bitfinex will get back.
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:39:50
No I think if you are with Bitfinex you should be proud to be in  the most dominating platform today and as far as ether is concern it is continue to gain its ground in digital currency..Nothing to Worry at all.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:56:19
Also same with me.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:19:28
