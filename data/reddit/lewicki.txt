They arn't a lender, and they dont charge fees on the transaction. There is nothing to give back. The reason why card companies give cash back is because they are charging above .5% in the first place. No matter what, the card companies still make money and you're deceived that you are getting money back.

Banks can provide multiple services. Which services are you trying to free yourself from?
Neo keeps full reserve and as a consequence don't use the deposits to lend out money. That means, what depositors store with them is completely safe.
Also someone, such as myself, may not feel comfortable digging holes in their backyard to bury partials of my private keys.
The private keys Neo issues are multi sig with 3 parts: Neo has a piece, the depositor has one, and some third party in case Neo goes bust. You need 2 pieces to unlock the funds in an account. I'd rather have this than be a squirrel that is constantly worried if my private keys are safe.

@_date: 2015-11-18 20:55:50
Likewise if you implement the scheme of using "fixed-size packets" you lose the ability to create a supply/demand based on block size. This seems like a very big negative. It may be a good idea to use fixed packet sizes, but not "fixing" it so that unfixed block sizes can work seems to be a better one.

Here are the details of the dividend payment made yesterday:
Mining Revenue for the week:              
80.00 BTC.
Growth And Expansion Fund Payment: 
 61.13 BTC   
Total: 141.13 BTC
The Growth And Expansion Fund is not needed now as we are unwinding AMC and preparing for it to be merged into
Active Mining which does not have a Growth And Expansion Fund defined.  Growth And Expansion will come from
the general revenue of the company, which can include income from mining, sales, and services.  Also, the shares
which AMC owned and where receiving dividends were de-issued as it did not serve any purpose due to the
merger for AMC to continue receiving dividends.

Full disclosure: I'm invested in AMC
I like it, I like it a lot. Their Avalons should be arriving within a week (they placed their orders on feb 18th, feb 10th orders are being shipped atm). They've also placed 2 orders totaling 20,000 chips which would add up to over 5TH.
Whether or not any of these orders have actually been placed remains to be seen (just screenshots have been shown so far). They come across as smart individuals but lacking the aptitude for conducting business in a public forum so it comes off kinda scammy.
But I refuse to miss the ASICminer 2.0 boat. If that makes me a fool, then so be it.

Your main concern is warranted. There are many facets to which I know present problems and even more that I do not know myself as I'm not an accountant or a lawyer. One good thing that I found out recently is that [the SEC just voted to lift the ban on General Solicitation]( What regulations is he infringing on or should be concerned about? If and when new regulations come out, to be in its best interest, I'm sure ActiveMining would comply with said regulations. 
VMC's website is dog shit, you're right. There's maybe 3-4 people working there, however I don't think they could be any more busy at the moment. I know from talking with him about 2 weeks ago, that he was in the midst of getting the shopping cart working (which it is apparently now). However, as a developer myself, the site IS cringe-worthy. It looks to be jumbled together plugins. I'm chalking the typos and general site shoddiness up to time constraints.
As far as security goes. Mining will talk place at [the Springfield Underground]( As far as I'm concerned, breaking into that place would be akin to breaking into a bank.
Assembly looks like it will be at the VMC location. Less secure.

I purchased AMC yesterday as well. I don't think there is much growth (save dividends) left in ASICminer. They are bumping up closer to the 51% each day and that makes their growth unsustainable.
I like what I've read about AMC. Seems like a deal to me. A few dividends from the Avalons should be rolling in soon as well. But when they start pumping out their own chips, the shits going to hit the fan - bitcoin shit that is.
Wishful thinking is that this is the new ASICminer stock. Especially once people get bored of ASICminer
The volume is starting to pick up at a pretty good clip:

No one ever explains mining coherently. It's simple:
A connection needs to be made to explain that miners process transactions, and as a result have the possibility of being rewarded with bitcoins since processing these transactions cost electricity, have costs, etc. That is a lot easier to explain and to understand; I'm not sure why it is never explained that way.

* i'm only going to explain buying with currency, and i'm going to assume that you live in the US and you would like to get things started as simply as possible
* [go to bit floor](
* sign up for an account and go to the deposit tab
* check the 3 check boxes and specify how much money you want to spend buying bitcoins (the service charges about 1%)
* copy down what exact amount and bank of america account number that you have to send the money to
* log into your bank of america account or go to a bank of america with your cash and fill out a deposit slip (MAKE SURE AMOUNT IS CORRECT) and deposit the money
* log back into bit floor and check your funds, they should be there
* go to the trade tab, fill out out maby bitcoins you want to buy
* after you have finished buying them, transfer your bit coins to your wallet
* click the receive money tab in bitcoin-qt, that address is what you will use to receive bit coins(think of it like bank and bank account number and routing number rolled into 1)
* have bitfloor send the bit coins to that address.
