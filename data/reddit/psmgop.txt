I agree with "it doesn't print money" and the rest. But I would argue that the 1.5% inflation rate isn't accurate when it comes to common household products and services. The way governments and the Fed measure inflation is not completely unbiased. And the way governments subsidize products to make prices appear cheaper leads to dishonest pricing and price discovery.

Goldbugs totally exaggerate. And for the most part I agree with what you're saying. 
Those who say QE pumps would cause hyperinflation presuppose that all the money going from the Fed to Banks would immediately be lent out to the public and send the domino effect into motion.
In reality, a lot of that money is being held onto by banks with the exception of investments that have proven profitable (for example: stock market). The rise in stock prices looks like price inflation especially when we see how profitable some of these corporations really are.
But Austrians see that as creating another bubble to recover the losses of the previous.

No. I'm not. People assign value to things. Value is not inherent in things. Gold has value because it had previous market value, not because gold is magical. USD has value because people demand it, not because cloth rectangles are special. It takes people to choose to value something due to its ability to serve as a means of exchange. Nothing inherently has value.

argument over terms:
I would still argue that 'value independent of its use as medium' isn't "intrinsic" but rather regressive. For example, Mises argued that gold was a great form of currency because the market placed value on gold (for whatever subjective reason or reasons). 
Historically, the words "intrinsic" and "inherent" relating to value tend to mean that the item is valuable regardless of human opinion, use, etc. It's as if gold is valuable simply because it is gold...and I'm sure you'd agree that is nonsense.

It bothers me that a follower of Austrian economics can so quickly abandon the subjective theory of value...even if it is for hard money.

@_date: 2018-06-10 17:15:56
For the last 8 years, I have spoken to several Austrian professors in the U.S. and Canada at different Austrian and libertarian gatherings to make the case for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies/assets. Austrians tend to not be fans of Bitcoin *even with* its programmed scarcity.
No matter what stripe of Austrians\-\-they range from *Rothbardians* who are completely against anything not gold (Mises Institute),t*o Misesia*ns who prefer gold or gold backed currencies (analyzing any currency through the "regression theorem"), t*o Hayekia*ns who are "fine with it existing in competition with other currencies".
There is definitely more room for exploration of digital currencies in the Hayekian camp. To completely ignore guys like Milton Friedman or the more modern Behavioral Economic school is actually working against yourself. Have an open mind, and realize that die\-hard obedience to one school of thought is the same "pretense of knowledge" Hayek often wrote about.
This is a new class of assets that none of the named economists above could have clearly dreamed of... so maybe the schools of thought are the ones who have to adapt rather than the world having to adapt to the Austrian view.

Sure. As far as I can tell, although I do consider myself knowledgeable about anarchism in general, the difference between market anarchism and anarcho-capitalism can best be seen in the arguments between Sam Konkin III and Murray Rothbard. 
I like to think that not all market anarchists are ancap, but all ancaps are market anarchists. Many market anarchists are anti-capitalist because they still adhere to the traditional anarchist definition of capitalism, but they do believe that markets and individual choice are the best way to identify, allocate, and distribute goods throughout a society. 
I am one who believes that someone like Lysander Spooner would not identify today as an ancap. He wrote furiously against capitalism and often identified as a socialist. He was even a member of the Socialist First International Conference in Geneva.
How do ancaps who worship Spooner reconcile this? The only things they know about Spooner are what they are fed from Rothbard.
The issue at large is and always will be the definition of capitalism. Ancaps define capitalism and free markets as synonymous. They say, 'If it's not a free market, it's not capitalist.' And that's the problem. They get lost in translation with the trad-anarchists. 
Anarchists, most of them anyway, have completely separate ideas about free markets and capitalism. Capitalism is a more complex idea not just the concept of free voluntary trade.
@_date: 2015-04-16 13:43:33
Traditionally they identified as such, but when comparing the vast array of anarchist ideas, mutualists tend to be in the middle. And when you start swinging to the right, you get your individualists, then your market anarchists, and then you're ancaps.

I'm a fan of gold and silver etc. But this is the issue. Every single seller of gold and silver that advertised as a way to hedge inflation is making the claim that we should buy metals to then later convert into a higher amount of USD. I don't believe that the majority of society will trade in silver and gold as a primary currency. That is a clear difference between Bitcoin true believers and bimetallists. Bitcoin can easily replace the digital dollar.

@_date: 2013-12-02 20:29:15
Exactly. As a believer in Austrian economics, I can't stand how so many people cling to this notion of intrinsic value. Carl Menger, Easily the founding father of Austrian economics, spoke of the subjectivity of value. How can we actually believe in an item's intrinsic value? We shouldn't and we should reject every argument based on this concept. That is to say, things aren't intrinsically valuable. Humans assess the value in things. Austrians tend to promote the regression theorem. And that's fine. If the debate is between gold and government money, gold value in the free market secures the stability of a currency. I don't think any Bitcoin enthusiast disagrees with that. Yet the regression theorem is important because of the security and stability of a currency, not necessarily because of its previous value. If we live in a society where gold and silver values were manipulated... Then the regression theorem becomes a joke. The currency's stability and security is in question. So the main point about Bitcoin is simple. It may not be the best currency according to Mises and the regression theorem (though that can be debated because of the multiple potential uses of a cryptographic blockchain). But there is market demand for the characteristics that Bitcoin offers: Personal security as well as security from arbitrary laws from corrupt politicians, speed, cost efficiency, and connectivity.
