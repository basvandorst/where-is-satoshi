You can't prove the unknown miners is a single pool.

[It's not really a good idea]( unless you're a miner, exchange or payment gateway.

Back then there was no almost identical chain to shift your money too. People were stuck with it and couldn't get their money out unless they paid a large fee. Now there's Bitcoin Cash, a nice network with fast confirmation times, low fees and a real chance of all the mining power shifting across.

A solid (and proven) business idea is for sites that take Bitcoin payments on behalf of a merchant/retailer and convert it to USD/EUR immediately for them and pay it into their bank account, then they're not exposed to the volatility of Bitcoin prices. This is quite attractive for various merchants.

If Linus Torvalds (the kernel gatekeeper) was on RedHat's payroll then that would be a different story. At the moment with a strong gatekeeper like Linus he can accept pull requests from anywhere and any company based on their merits and not be accused of bias. In Bitcoin it's more of a free for all with no leader committing whatever they want in. So if half the developers are blockstream, then that's a big bias controlling the Bitcoin Core code.

Nobody uses words like 'for' or 'of' in acronyms. There's no USOA.

Morse code. Unless you mean sending pieces of moss around the planet specifically cut to represent the bitcoin address. Actually that sounds less far fetched than the [VC sending via satellite in the desert](

Of course they do, see Coinify etc.

It's not really useful to see recent changes to hash rate. You'd want hourly, 12 hourly, daily and weekly options. Where do they get the information from?

The price of Bitcoin might be 1 million USD, but that doesn't mean 1 USD will buy what you can buy with it today. 1 USD then might be worth a ply of toilet paper, kinda like the Venezuelan Bolivar.

Or you just reduce the desired block time from 10 minutes to 2 minutes, thus you can reduce the block size from 1.49 GB to 300 MB and achieve Visa levels. When you do this you also need to reduce the block reward at the same time now that blocks are being found faster.

164 pages leaked to "The Intercept", only 4 pages published. The Intercept is more of a paper shredder than a news website. They should have leaked it to Wikileaks. That guy releases everything.

Which company is involved with Bitcoin Cash?

Better alternative than Blockstream and AXA.
