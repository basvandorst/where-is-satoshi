I like the Brandon Marshall Foundation.  Good cause and if we can get bitcoin on there page along with other donations it could garner some good exposure.

Actually probably a good thing .. Wanted want the government to control that big a portion of the mining power... However by 2018 that will probably be a smaller portion of the network. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:30:24
yes gocoin does 
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:08:28

Analyzer your great ... Pass it on 100 bits

Mining will never be finished.  The block reward will go down per the code but once there are 21 million coins the miners will continue to solve blocks but only get the transaction fees.  By this time there will be so many transactions per block that the transaction fees will be substantial enough to compensate the miners accordingly.

After taking a closer look it appears   is one of the potential double spends on that address.  Looks like a coin base transaction where the pool mined a block but didn't propagate to the rest of the network fast enough or somehow that block got orphaned, I am not sure but I believe thats probably why it shows potential double spends... What I can't figure out is why he would send the coins to a mining pools address as that pool mines a good deal of coins each day I doubt he runs the pool.

Happy Tuesday Analyzer heres 100 bits on me @_date: 2015-02-10 19:12:55

He was probably trying to figure a way to "double-spend" his way to having 100x the amount of coin given to him ... What a jackass and people actually donated to him to create a "bitcoin plus" sorry but theres a saying a fool and his crypto are easily separated 
@_date: 2015-02-09 11:19:44
Hell I don't think you can make that many buys a day lol

Hong Kong-based Bitcoin trading and investment outfit MyCoin.hk has allegedly entered sudden bankruptcy, reportedly losing customers up to HK$3 billion (US$386.9 million) in bitcoins.
The South China Morning Post estimates that as many as 3,000 private users may be implicated in the losses, with pyramid scheme accusations coming from both consumers and lawmakers.
“No one seems to know who is behind this,” user Lau, who originally invested HK$1.3 million in four Bitcoin contracts, told the publication. “Everyone says they too are victims … but we were told by those at higher tiers [of the scheme] that we can get our money back if we find more new clients.”
MyCoin was seemingly above suspicion at the height of its popularity in summer 2014, featuring a professional online presence, as well as events at “luxury hotels” and guest appearances from figures such as Jim Rogers.
However, investors only received an online account upon submission of their Bitcoin, with no proof of payment and no verifiable information regarding refunds or plausible safety nets. In December, MyCoin began prohibiting full account withdrawals unless further investors were found. Payouts have recently become uncompetitive, the company valuing each bitcoin at HK$20 against an international value of HK$1,770 as of February 8. The largest single investment is considered to be HK$50 million.
“I was told by my real estate agent that the profit would be over HK$2 million after one year,” another investor told the SCMP regarding an HK$ 1.8-million loss over seven contracts, adding that she “shouldn’t have been so greedy.”
MyCoin has yet to comment on the situation, while local media are already carrying admonishments regarding the unpredictability of such investment schemes and even Bitcoin itself.
Senior accounting and finance professor at the Chinese University Simon Lee told local network Radio Televison Hong Kong that the government “should ban Bitcoin” under its jurisdiction in the wake of the MyCoin scandal.
Nonetheless, suspicions are rife within the cryptocurrency community that the reports are not legitimate, and that the amounts involved have been overstated. The most popular consensus on Reddit regarding the news follows the sentiment of user u/revman, who considers the SCMP article to have already been “completely discredited.” A link to a similar Bitcointalk forum post is included, but as yet no substantive evidence has been publicized relating to either theory.
The news follows the loss last month by Chinese exchange 796 of around 1,000BTC, and is the second revelation to hit the local Bitcoin scene this year.

That address is for a miner pool.  "bw pool" not sure which pool that is but there are a lot of coin base transactions to it.  How much BTC did people donate for this XBC coin.  Yes there may only be 56K XBC but that doesn't make them worth 500BTC each.  Bitcoin has value because among other things you can use it at over 100K merchants, its the oldest crypto-coin, and there is a ton of applications built on top of the protocol.  What does XBC have built on top of it?? Where can you spend it at?? Hell you can't probably even get alpaca socks for it lol.  If scarcity is what puts value to something I am gonna go create XBS and only have 1,000 of them and sell them to get a ton of bitcoin.
