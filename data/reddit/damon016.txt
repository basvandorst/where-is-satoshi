In all fairness, hes an idiot either way. Who the hell would trust someone wanted for the murder of an innocent person "still". He can't go back to many places because of it... He goes up and pumps/dumps tokens, fakes an illness.. He's a joke. I wish someone would remove him from society, but we won't be that lucky.

Sucks that coinbase got rid of the option to go from CB to PayPal... =/  
But as stated there were so many fraud issues, you prob won't see it.

First of all you're a fucking idiot. Second of all, did you see him kill the dogs? 
I knew Faull, visted his bar here in Orlando at UCF. People would bring dogs outside and he would give them water and love on them despite people (including my self) not wanting to be around mutts when im eating food etc.  So I will call bull shit on your claim unless you were there, and ill bet you were not so your story is null.
Second, McAfee would not have had all the issues with Belize law enforcement and abroad had he not been a shit head "for some time". 
Third, faking illness and being a pathological liar is it MO, he is and has always been a fucking liar/piece of garbage. 
So keep believing what you read on the internet there... lmao
