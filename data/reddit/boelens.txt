I generated an address here LONG ago. Guess I'll have to move it. Goodbye firstbits 1BoeLens :(. Can I un-import a privkey from Bitcoin-Qt?  
EDIT: And moved. Whew. Glad I wasn't a victim. I was new to BTC when I did this and I never thought about it.
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:59:21
Holy crap that's awesome :D that's super nice of you!
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:38:24
Awesome! I've used the free version and will soon buy premium. Shame it still sees Bitcoin-qt as a virus though and tries to delete the blockchain everytime.
@_date: 2014-05-26 20:06:30
I did exactly that. High res, color, no redactons, every detail included. I only cropped the white area of the images off to make it fit in for the max size.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:36:20
I don't quite understand - I get how images can be sent with a transactions but how do you see the image/find it?
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:14:23
I always have Qt on but don't have that port forwarded and always have 8 connections. I'd love to help out but will I be able to still use internet normally? Usually when I upload at full speed (300KB/s) my entire internet is slowed down.
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:14:41
Guess it depend on who'se in the office verifying or something.

I have used laptops for gaming for the past 5 years and never had issues with it. It was not overpriced at all and was about the same price I would've gotten as building a PC and it runs all the games I play smoothly at 60 FPS, on high settings. I'm not even under extreme circumstances I just really enjoy the mobility. Really not all gaming laptops have a bunch of issues.
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:13:15


  
I'm not sure, I slightly disagree there. Surely it's pretty hard to buy BTC as a child without an adult paying for you (you could use localbitcoins), otherwise it's not that hard with the amount of simple,easy to use wallets we're getting, informational websites, and spreading interest. I didn't see the presentation but awesome to see you're spreading it! I'm 15 myself and nobody in my class is that interested in it either, there are a few people who say it'll be illegal in no-time anyway and I should just sell.
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:51:17
I see, interesting, thanks for the answer!
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:57:10
Hm, I get your point, there are certainly still some difficulties that need to be improved, however, I bought through Bitstamp without much of any problem. But it is a lot of figuring out, it can definitely be simpllified.
@_date: 2014-05-26 20:04:10
He can't get sued for a negative review. Maybe if he made false statements, otherwise you have nothing to worry about. Why is your ISP threatening to give out your address?
@_date: 2014-05-26 20:08:58
I'm trying to get my coins out already for over a month now but they're denying every verification request.

Game tournaments are probably a good idea, I'd love to see a BTC tournament for Hearthstone too.

I have funds stuck there I want to withdraw.
@_date: 2014-05-26 19:59:55
I have funds stuck in Bitstamp from when it didn't need to be verified yet.
@_date: 2017-02-01 13:30:09
Doesn't that mean confirmations will also take longer though? And why would miners suddenly cease operating, this doesn't indicate a difficulty doubling yet right?
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:05:56
How do blocks work at that point? Do transactions not confirm ~ every 10 minutes anymore? What's the reward for miners? Especially if everything is mined
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:42:03
What? How is this a troll post?
@_date: 2017-01-26 03:04:59
I see, thanks.
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:43:34
Ahh, I see. What's the usual confirmation time for fees that are just too low?
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:57:51
Making 240k/year is not really being a failure.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:21:38
I never said bitcoin itself wasn't working correctly though? I just asked why it wasn't confirming.
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:12:31
How does that work though? Aren't all blocks on the same blockchain, SegWit or not? How can there be 2MB blocks and &lt;1MB blocks on the same blockchain even if your node supports SegWit?
@_date: 2016-06-14 12:23:36
I don't see the message, how do you see it?
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:24:05
Ah - I see. Thanks for explaining! Been a bit confused on the whole SegWit thing.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:13:07
Alright, thanks :)
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:40:07
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:51:23
Why is 95% the magic number rather than 100%? And what happens now for miners who upgrade to segwit before this 95% conversion ratio is reached, are they also rejecting blocks or do they just mine at the 1MB limit still?
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:54:25
I know it to an extend, yes. Evidently I'm not aware of the different confirmation times dependant on the fees so that's why I'm here asking it. Not sure what the problem is.
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:33:09
So if half of the mining pools are using segwit, and the other half aren't, will we see 2MB blocks and 1MB blocks? Or does it have to be a majority?
@_date: 2016-11-09 23:29:19
What time will you be paying out at?
@_date: 2016-11-22 08:42:11
I'm pretty sure this generation we'll have people living up to age 130 or more. We're already getting some really old people and medicine is improving rapidly, technology exponentially.
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:49:34
I'll try that. Not sure if it's worth it to ship it internationally when it might not even work. But I'll see.

Holy shit you are MVP. You actually delivered. WP.

I'm fairly sure it's pretty much impossible to fix corrupted RAID-0 drives though? Even with professionals. I guess I might be wrong, not sure where I'd find a place that does that though.
@_date: 2016-11-22 08:43:24
Yea I had a similar issue. Two drives, RAID-0 formatted, one of them corrupted. I had no backups and that wallet has a few bitcoins on it, anywhere between 1 and 5. But it's pretty much impossible to recover the files.
@_date: 2016-11-09 19:54:20
Holy shit you're amazing dude :D
@_date: 2016-12-10 15:07:08
Well het buy-order is al locked in voor deze prijs dus dat is niet heel convenient juist. Plus ik heb de bitcoin maar voor een uurtje ofzo, is voor een transactie.
@_date: 2016-11-22 11:14:34
Yeah it was in a laptop that had 2 drives in it and used RAID-0, I didn't even know until it failed.

Well that's pretty good if you're buying 5k worth.
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:02:42
And transaction fees atm are like $3.. what a joke
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:39:34
I am aware of the average 10 min transaction time. And yes, I agree, altcoins are mostly useless. But at this point it simply isn't the cheapest anymore. I'd have lower transaction fees using PayPal or wire transfer right now.
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:41:29
Obviously it's not a problem for moving larger sums of money. But bitcoins primary purpose isn't just storing large sums of money very safely. It's still used as a currency and currencies will be used to buy smaller products or services for say, $10. If you buy something for 10 bucks worth of BTC and you have to pay a $3 transaction fee, that's extreme. And a big selling point of bitcoin is supposed to be fast transaction speed and cheap transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:16:23
No, it isn't fit for that currently. Which is bad. Because that was and is bitcoins intention, bitcoin is supposed to be used as a currency, not just for large transactions. And this is a problem that can be fixed on top of that.
@_date: 2016-07-11 20:53:13
Because people love spending hours to end up getting less than a cent..
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:29:57
I heard about them earlier, very early when they were still so cheap. "I thought, huh. This could someday be something. May put a few bucks in there sometime." Never did. I hate myself.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:12:21
I know, that's what I'm trying to say. I just wanted to share my opinion, not try to give advice on people who have invested such important amounts, again, sorry.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:52:35
Please drop a coin on my head, as nice as brick of solid gold sounds, I believe the eventual medical  bills of a possibly fractured skull and other possible brain damage and permanent damage is a lot more than the brick of gold. A coin, however, is always a nice gesture.  
  
Seriously though, interesting to see this! I'll check it out tomorrow-ish when I have some more time, but sounds good!

Yay! \o/ , thanks to your tip I even found out I had 0.04BTC on my Reddit tips wallet or whatever it is, someone must've tipped it but I never saw it :O. Thanks a bunch! You must be pretty BTC rich =P.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:38:44
Wow, thanks! That's very awesome! =D. I'll also take a look at that site! But how do I exactly redeem the tip? I got the message, and accepted it, but what now? I'm very new to this, sorry! =P
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:04:48
Ah, right. Of course, nobody knows for sure! I think it'll go back up, but only time will tell.
@_date: 2013-08-12 21:14:38
So, will this increase or decrease the price of BTC? How will this affect miners?
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:09:41
I actually wanted to make my own if it didn't exist yet, but I didn't want to make something that already existed so I asked here first =P. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:04:08
Ah, okay. Must've been implemented after I purchased gold! Guess I'll give it a shot!
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:58:20
Are there any things on how wallet adresses and such works? I want to buy some BTC but am afraid of making mistakes and want to be well informed.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:22:24
I enjoy memes now and then, but not for bitcoin. "Hurdur, the price is low!" "Sell your bitcoins now!" "Bad luck brian bought at price xxxx" It's just not funny and annoying.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:25:24
That's odd, why would they do that?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:19:20
Uhm, excuse me? I'm open to opinions and thoughts, but this is just plain rude.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:25:42
Bitstamp was great for me, purchased when it dipped to 160. Placed the order, and I got my BTC very quickly, good system, low fee's, quick transfer times.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:21:37
I would imagine in game advertisements, since it's possible with custom textures.
@_date: 2013-06-23 23:34:43
Awesome! Like the site too, great to see you got enough donations to do this! =).
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:34:56
Yep, was there. That guy was betting whole BTC's on blackjack, damn I wish I had the money to gamble that o.o
@_date: 2013-08-04 23:39:05
I hope they do so then, I'd love to leave by a donation.

If this is real, and $200M is invest, I can see a huge increase in their shares coming up.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:45:24
I use it as a currency, what I'll buy? No idea. I've bought honey for BTC, game, reddit gold, sold some BTC IRL, I use it as both a currency and investment.
@_date: 2013-08-07 11:05:01
Has the server been fixed yet? The site works a lot faster for me now.
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:07:37
Well, I sold high, bought cheap and made about .2 profit, I think most of the panic selling is over for now, but only time will tell.
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:23:34
How so? Bitcoins gave me an easy way to invest in things/shares, wich I made profit of. It's just a function of Bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-09-07 16:47:20
Not to sound bad, but it was actually his fault.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:26:28
Bitstamp is great as far as I know, I used it and it went quick and smooth. I recommend buying in a bit of a dip but you can just buy current price. ( I suggest waiting a day, some lag going on currently.)
@_date: 2013-09-07 17:40:30
Yes, but he could've taken MANY better security measures. The warning for this exploit had been out for a while and should've been fixed already. Also, the administrator accounts were not password protected, that's very silly.

Purchasing slots, I hate bidding personally and it's alot easier to just purchase a slot. For pricing models, floating BTC.

@_date: 2013-12-18 15:57:13
How is this pump and dumping? I've made a fair share of losses on this price drop, I bought in more at 1000$ than I bought in at 100$.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:22:22
Exactly! But yeah, we're probably a minority so I assume it will change to mBTC by default.
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:53:53
The drawing will be soon, however someone managed to make a bot and submit 300,000 entries, so I have to clean this mess out. Also, some other people who spammed it.

Glad to hear that, I was about to buy an ad there, glad I didn't.

Wooh! I was thinking of doing this myself on games such as CSS,CSS:GO,and other games that could allow it, but I was too worried about the hacker risk. Very glad to see this is done!

@_date: 2013-08-17 12:26:51
Well - I had already downloaded the entier blockchain before I knew there were others that did not require this, but I just like the general looks of QT and everything, Electrum doesn't appeal me as much.

Well, I think most black hats would be less tempted to go to the "light side" because it'd pay out less, in example, this is 40,000,000$, that's a LOT. But I agree with you, I could never go black hat and live with having stolen money and such. Does not feel right.
@_date: 2013-09-11 18:06:14
Hah, I had no idea you were 16. I thought you were atleast 18+, I have no idea why I had this impression though. Also, I'm fairly sure Gyft does work in the UK, if you go to their site and go to the card selection, you can sort on country.
@_date: 2013-07-28 01:15:18
I do hope this would be optional? Some people (including me) don't have a smartphone.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:48:18
I agree! And I also like that you're actually using it, it is indeed a currency. I expect BTC will go back up, but who knows what prices we'll see before that?
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:03:00
Weird. It had 3 confirmations and was not showing up. Now it is. Must've been a weird error.

Fair enough. Eitherhow, I removed all the bots from the database and drew real winners.

Yeah, you're right, I'm complaining about basically nothing here, sorry =P.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:46:28
Well... It may be down a bit currently. But it'll be back up by the time you're back, I'm very confident.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:17:36
I'm not going all in, but at this price it's definately worth buying as it'll go back up, long term or short term.
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:39:29
Ah, I see. It seems it doesn't show anything for my IP, but I think it's working properly.. Hm, I'll look into it later. Thanks! I'm curious, would it be possible to host/rent a VPS and run a node on that?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:46:57
I'm holding, still buying more. It will go back up, I'm super sure. Plus, it's a great currency to buy things with.

True, I suppose, but it could also cause confusion. And yes, for some reason it's really hard for certain people to grasp the concept that you don't need to buy an entire bitcoin to invest, I usually just say "you don't have to buy an entire gold bar for 43,000$ to invest in gold". It's nonsense and it should get rid of. I guess we'll see what happens on bitcoinity though.
@_date: 2013-10-19 09:16:46
Oh yep, I see it! Nice spot!
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:37:54
Hm, I might be on it. I'm having a bit of trouble with the graph as it's not very precise, but I located the Netherlands and I live on the island 'Ameland' , I think it might be there, on the tip (you can google maps Ameland), but I think I'm on it! Quite cool.

Hey! Not to "hijack" a thread, but I actually have a growing MC server that gives you coins for playing, which pays you for ores mined, and monsters killed! You can also sell in-game items to other players. I thought you might be interested, so if you are, the url is :

@_date: 2013-09-11 17:57:58
Haha, not really. I actually hired someone for this gambling thing, the faucet I customized and fixed up a bunch o' errors myself. I've made a few small 'games' (text adventures) in C++, and worked with C# through Unity 3D. I've also used Python to try it out. I know how to do "decent"  web development, and could do it if I put my time in it. I have a good general understanding of code and how it works, giving me a pretty good bonus, but I haven't spent too much time on learning it, really, just trying small things out.

Cool! How are people naming these? I don't see a post a suggestion or anything on that sub. I heard gold was needed, I'm gold.

I suppose mistakes could be made in that, yes. But eh.. I guess it's just preference.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:47:16
Yeah I know, but is it profitable? I'm curious into investing.
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:04:14
I invested when I was 14, my dad was quite convinced it was a scam, but I was allowed to buy one bitcoin. My suggestions is to do your research, know how to store your coins properly and how to buy them, show it to them, why you think it's a good investment and why it isn't some sort of magical currency, but show them what it's based on. Also tell the you can learn the value greatly from this, and in years, who knows how much one BTC might be?
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:08:40
I haven't ordered there because I'm on an island with only one take-away restaurant which is closed most days in the winter, and they only have chinese food.  
  
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:49:14
You must be quite happy then! Haha.
@_date: 2013-08-12 11:40:45
I don't know yet - I reallly haven't done any balancing yet. The rewards will probably be fairly low, but this is because once you get to diamond tools and enchantments, everything is much faster, so then, you start earning more.  
  
I am the only owner, and have some BTC myself which will be put into the funding, afterwards, we will offer advertisements and possibly donor packages (nothing big or game changing, maybe a coloured name.)  
  
Just like why I have a faucet, spread some BTC to those that want to start off, or just want to earn some.
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:17:27
I've heard some people are worried that the e-mails will be used for collection of spam e-mails or breaching accounts. I have no intent of that but if you are worried you can create a seperate e-mail address to enter.  
My BTCtalk profile with decent trust :   
I've also ran the domesticpineapple faucet succesfully for a while. The funds are held in escrow by Dooglus here :   
  
The wallet however is not seperately created and as seen is in use, the funds however, are being held by Dooglus which he can also confirm and will be paid out.
@_date: 2013-08-05 19:47:39
Has a block been discovered yet? I could aim my block erupter towards your pool, it won't help a lot, but hey, a chance for 1BTC for me, and a chance for you to find a block!
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:39:31
True. I currently got 1.33 BTC, but if it goes down to a low price again, I'll be mass buying, possibly mining. Because it won't go up at crazy speed anymore, but slowly. It'll be a long term investment, which in the end will certainly be worth it. I'm just holding on to my BTC, unlike all the advice here. IMO it's the best thing to currently do.
@_date: 2013-07-26 13:46:14
Ah, I see now, thanks for the detailed post!
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:58:43
Yeah, you're right. I do EXPECT it to go up though. I just purchased 1.3 BTC for 160$ each, that was awesome. But yeah, I do hope it goes up again, otherwise I'll cry in a corner. But even if it does, it will go back up in long term.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:15:55
If you lose your wallet, and have no backups, it's gone.

For anyone wondering, I've done this too 5 months ago in April, if anyone wants to compare :

Yeah, it should be fairly easy. I'll just try and make it, if it becomes anything decent I'll release it but I highly doubt it.

I just bought 1.3 BTC for 160$ per BTC! I'm glad someone sold. But yeah, people need to stop selling.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:55:44
I bought at 1000$ and I'm not worried.  
EDIT: To clarify, I've had BTC for some time and also have bought in before 100$, but also bought at 1000$.

No, you should not have won. Just because you're some script kiddy who can make a bot doesn't mean you deserve money. You tried to cheat and obviously I'll disqualify you for that and I will NOT reward a botter.

I'm sorry, what do you mean exactly?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:04:11
Fair enough. And no, I didn't invest my allowance. I got some money as a gift to buy bitcoin, then I did some small jobs on to earn some BTC, did some contests, invested in shares a bit, etc, untill I got up till about 15BTC. And yes, there is not much I can lose. Or, practically nothing as it didn't start from my own money. But I would definitely be upset when losing money because I have to move out next year and I'll need money for that. Anyhow, this post is being upvoted quite a bit and my posts downvoted, so, eh, guess it's a bit of a circlejerk. I realize now my post definitely doesn't have a strong point, but I might aswell keep it here.

Aw, really? I'd prefer BTC being on default, and mBTC being an option. I want to know the price of a full BTC, not an mBTC. Price tickers of the dollar show the value of a full dollar too, not 10 cents. You can convert it yourself, IMO.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:43:20
I don't see it as much as an investment, but as a currency to use. I bought in some around 100$ but I bought more at 1000$.
@_date: 2013-09-18 16:15:09
Seems cool! It'll be tough writing an entertaining story with bitcoin though. I have no real 'entertaining' experiences, so I'd have to write something fictional... Hmm. Good things there's a big timeframe! =P.

Ah, I see. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:51:21
Why is BTC too big of a unit? I don't see how mBTC is more convenient. It's the same deal. 0.7*1000 = 700$ or 700*1$=700$ if you do it per mBTC. Same thing, what's so special about using mBTC? I think it's much handier to use BTC, instead of mBTC.  
EDIT: Reddit formatting messed this up. I meant 0.7 x 1000 = 700$ and 700 x 1$ = 700$
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:22:02

@_date: 2013-05-25 11:25:53
Ah yes, it was great when they were that price. It's a shame I didn't get any. (I actually probably had some on my old laptop where I mined a small bit and did some faucets when they were worth a lot less, and well, I gave the laptop to my dad and I didn't think of it, and then it was formatted.)
@_date: 2013-08-12 11:30:40

I don't know if this 12 year old is legit or not, but it's quite possible. I'm 14, and have already programmed using C++ and Python (not too much, but I understand it well), I have started doing and understanding this since I was about 12-ish, I've watched online videos on Chemistry in Biology, I don't know if this guy/kid is legit, but I do want to say it is possible.  
EDIT : Also, the writing proves nothing really, I've been typing like this since I was about 10-11, and English is my secondary language.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:19:51
Haha, that would be amazing, yes! I think I'm going to keep 1-2 BTC in savings. I also have a 2013 (one of the first funded) casascius coins with 1BTC, so if bitcoin ever increases greatly in price, I imagine that'd be of high value too.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:40:25
I'm 15, and I have enjoyed debating about things like that since I was 13-ish! Well, earlier, but I could make more proper arguments at that age. I've never really had the opportunity on school to write something about BTC or whatever, but I agree that debating is very important for people to do and learn. You can also see other peoples' opinions on things. Although, in my class I feel like it's useless, because for my classmates it's more of a "I CAN SHOUT LOUDEST, YOU ARE WRONG YOU DIPSHIT"

Heya! Not sure if you're still responding, but how can once suggest a server name? I've bought gold multiple times and gifted it multiple times too, of which one gift fairly recent. I was told I'd get an invite to the topic of some sort, but it didn't seem to happen.
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:04:56
It's fairly common sense IMO, I won't let a bot get 0.12BTC. All entries left in the DB now are legitemate entries.

@_date: 2013-09-11 17:50:41
Haha, it really isn't as much as it sounds like. They're just very small projects I do, which I really enjoy doing. It doesn't take a whole lot of time to maintain (the faucet has probably given me most work currently, in terms of having to change a bunch around in the script, scraping up some donations =P), but it's not too much work. I am currently also working on getting a small gambling site up myself, using BTC.
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:29:41
Happy cake day! I know a friend of you who is on that friend list.. I feel slightly involved I suppose =P. I mainly lurk here though.
@_date: 2013-11-09 10:46:53
Aw, that sucks! I heard of it too around early/mid 2011, and wanted to buy but I kind of forgot about it. I just did a bunch of faucets and such when they paid out more.... Then I wiped that hard drive and god knows what was on that wallet ;_;
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:26:17
... What's a brain wallet? I know someone who stores hunderds/thousands on them and told me they're very good for large amounts.
@_date: 2013-09-23 12:19:20
Bit late to reply but, I've talked to the owner and he told me that he has it for "sale" to make it look more like a demo instance, however the script does function well, he's told me, "I'll just "forget" any e-mails I get about anyone wanting to buy the script." So that's how he's trying to protect himself legally, but I'm fairly sure this is more going down the route of fraud than protecting yourself.  
EDIT: Also, on that note, today something happened. Apparantly admin (TradeFortress) had a friend long(?) ago on a game called eRepublic who wanted some web hosting, and he shared his web hosting for a forum, but it was never built. And I don't know the full story but AFAIK a phishers was hosted on the same server as CoinLenders and it was possibly compromised.
@_date: 2013-09-06 11:56:30
Because I don't even have a smartphone and use BTC. I assume there aren't many people anymore like me, but still.
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:36:35
My plan was to just make a small thing you can plop onto your desktop, include chart and price in fairly big letters on top, updates however often the API allows (5-10 seconds), but no sounds. Honestly I probably won't even make it public or anything, unless it actually looks decent. I just want something to quickly see the price on my desktop.
@_date: 2013-08-12 02:17:26
Yeah, I did notice that, but, as you said, more the merrier! People play mulltiple dice gambling games in example, can be the same for this. Also, I'll try and offer competetive rates, and, my rewards will be based on mobs / ores. The only trouble I'm currently having is how to prevent people from mob grinding and X-raying. As for x-raying, there a few things  that can be done against it, but never completely. Mob grinding, unsure. I'm definately making the spawn rate lower, or high amount of mobs but lower amount of rewards per mob, same principe. I don't want people to use an auto-clicker and get a bunch of BTC for grinding a mob. So yeah, there are a few things I need to work out on this, but for grinding prevention, it will most likely just have low mob spawn rates, but higher pay per mobs. Also, a fun little feature I thought off, possibly spawning a giant occasionally with a high reward, and I'm not sure if it's possible in MC, but maybe with a LOT of health, and a high reward. Anyhow, the general input seems to be very positive, so I'm going to do this! I have some experience maintaining and administrating servers (2 1/2 years), so it should get up pretty quickly. And the plugin itself is fairly easy too, even something I might be able to code, haha.
@_date: 2013-09-14 10:34:15
Thanks for this! There have been 1000+ posts in that topic in just ten hours, and it's a taaad bit too much for me to read at once =P. I wonder what comes out of this, and this must suck a lot for the share holders.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:06:48
Yeah, I guess. Still, jesus. I couldn't imagine throwing away a gift in one click like that.
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:32:10

Hey, I remember you! We talked a bit I think. I'm ~~14~~ 15 now, ugh, and use BTC. I've used it since 'bout April. I own quite an amount of total value now! I have multiple Casascius coins, and two ASICminer USB miners, one bought for novelty purposes, one won in a raffle. I've explained BTC to my brother who invested  in it, my father isn't too fond of it, and my mother doesn't really understand it. I don't know of many people, but I do know there are definitely some people in your/my age range in the world of bitcoin =).

As a 14 year old, this is exactly what is still being told to me, and was also being told me at the age of 12. Some people are just dicks about it, ignore them. Glad to see there are other younger-ish children around there with a good level of intelligence and spelling.

I see. And where do you get those "ASIC miners"? What exactly are they?

I removed all the xpdb e-mail addresses easily. I don't get why you'd try to ruin it like that, but alas. Hope you enjoyed wasting resources on this.

Generated too much hate comments, didn't really provide good content for the front page.

Also, to add on to my previous post (I typed it in a bit of a hurry), I am also involved in the community in numerous ways. I ocasionally help people out and do small things for contests such as designign logos. Apart from that I also sometimes use my block erupters to mine on new pools, atleast the ones that are trustworthy. I also run a faucet (completely off my own wallet, it's nearly out of donations), at  , and currently also run a MC server (out of my own wallet) where you earn coins for playing ( I'm also a fairly active and trusted member on Bitcointalk. I really like Bitcoin and the community, and I enjoy being in it! Outside of that I do the occasional gambling (Hush about the age, now.), and I've invested in shares on Bitfunder, and highly regret selling shares of ASICminer at 1BTC a share, which then boosted up to 4BTC a share a bit later. I also have a DVC faucet and give out low-interest (or 0%) interest loans on bitcointalk, however sadly recently a loan has failed and resulted me in a loss of 0.5BTC. That's about my experience with Bitcoin and what I'm doing right now, I'm having a positive experience with it and have already ordered multiple things using BTC! I certainly hope it'll get more widely accepted, as I have trust in it as a currency.

Murderscene wasn't in any way hacked, people are using that term wrongly. The exploit was that names didn't properly verify, and thus you could "steal" anyone's identity. He could have had updated this already.

I really want to donate but I can't donate any lower then 1BTC which is 100$, could you please allow people to enter lower amounts? I've entered it but it just doesn't update in the widget.

Because bitcoin addresses are anonymous, atleast in this case a lot of duplicate e-mails were obvious, and some people created bots but their patterns were easy to spot.

Oooh, okay, thanks! Really appreciate the help you're giving me. If I have any further issues/questions I'll be sure to post here! =)  
EDIT : Oh, I was wondering. Is there any subreddit for buying/selling with PayPal/Creditcard?

I wish my dad was about BTC like this, haha! I talk to him about it but he doesn't quite trust in it, or like it.

Well, don't go all-in of course. It's volatile and you can easily lose money. People put their college tuitions in BTC, which is not smart.

Wait, if you have bitcoin-qt is that a full node? Since April 2013 I've had bitcoin-qt entirely downloaded and on nearly 100% of the time. Does that mean I've been contributing, or?

I will add a captcha and maybe some srot of 1-2 entries per I.P. There are a few obvious duplicates, of course, if one of these gets drawn, I will simply re-draw.
