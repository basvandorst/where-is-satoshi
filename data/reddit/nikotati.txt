It is not misleading at all! I am talking about how Bittrex overlooked the minimal security measures on my account. You can put all your 2FA on Google but hackers can intrude anyway. The security must be solid on Bittrex account. Bittrex support showed all its fragility:
1. They didn't consider the IP address from which the request of disabling 2FA was coming. 
2. They trusted 2  photomontages easy to unmask. 
3. They didn't put withdrawals on hold, after 2FA was changed just few hours before.
4. They didn't respect the daily limit for withdrawals.

I told you, you are the genius, the smart one.

Bittrex overlooked completely the security I put in place. First rule if someone disable 2FA on the account withdrawals must be locked up for few days.

yes sure, you the expert

great ... You will come back to read it when they will hack your 2FA secured Google account, or whatever. Nobody is hack free

Hi Guys thanks for all your comments,
bitmegalomaniac, all the emails the hacker exchanged with Bittrex support are in my report, he didn't put any motivation for 2FA disabling. 
Regarding how they were able to enter in all my private information I guess it was through a fishing email received on my wife's laptop which shares with me some folders in home group. But I also suspect a Bittrex involvement in all this story.

Yes, you're right I was probably to easy-going not securing google account. But what about Bittrex support which disabled 2FA without freezing withdrawals? with  request coming from a strange IP address? If one changes his own 2FA security is not to empty the account, he can do it anyway with the old 2FA.

As I wrote in my message the hacker put a rule in my gmail to filter all messages from Bittrex, mark them as read and send them directly into the deleted bin.

Yes it was a Bittrex mistake. I am not a noob and I know how security should work on an exchanger account. 
Should I repeat to you what they did?
1. They didn't consider the IP address from which the request of disabling 2FA was coming.
2. They trusted 2 photomontages easy to unmask.
3. They didn't put withdrawals on hold, after 2FA was changed just few hours before.
4. They didn't respect the daily limit for withdrawals.
I'm gonna sue them and I want to get my money back!

I think they got pieces of information little by little with different means and waited the moment when they had all needed to intrude in Bittrex... but that's only my own supposition. I don't know exactly how they got access to all my private information

Thank you for the good luck. You are right, I made several mistakes in a row, but this doesn't absolve Bittrex for overlooking security check. Security check conducted just by email and no locking up withdrawals is a deadly combination, even a little bit suspicious. That's why I wrote to a law firm specialized in crypto exchangers for an assessment of the case.
