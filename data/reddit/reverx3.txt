It's because we broke the magical 10k in euro's! It's now time to move up to 15k$

Paypal is not convenient, it has some major flaws. Don’t even start on fiat per country. So there comes crypto and you... you talk about btc. LOL.

And a paper wallet is free too! Locking it up is ofcourse a great idea, you should do that with any wallet like ledger too.
Fiat is normal currency like USD and Euro.

Financial behaviour can be neglected if the smart decision would affect your health in anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:13:16
I think it would be best to look into a hardwallet (I have a ledger myself). Store it there and let it be. Also, you might consider to change some fiat and use it? You can easily do that on coinbase also. 
Anyway, lots of reading to do so good luck

Decentralization is nothig compared to convienence. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:47:19
Definitely, btc has shown that decentraliziation is nothing compared to convenience. It got outclassed by many other cryptos that supply both. 
@_date: 2019-11-14 21:23:28
Nah, it’s true if you talk about it the way people talk about it here. If you make it understandable for dummies it still works.

I sold 1/3rd of my portfolio to cover some of my initial investment. Yes I invested more than I was willing to lose, but that doesn't matter anymore now. I still belive in crypto, but I don't think this increasing spike can keep up. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:03:53
Biggest sign of a bubble close to popping is people doing that,
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:38:19
Believe me you don't. I have been there, lost a lot and there is only one real strategy for people like us... hodl. 
In all seriousness, don't try to beat those whales you will lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:43:11
I think this would be a great compromise. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:00:09
What about the impossible high gains in a very short time? There are so many examples in history that it ended in a bursting bubble when that happened. However, just like you I also believe in the future of crypto so in my eyes you're best of just investing in crypto in case it does take off (like it did last weeks). 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:03:47
Funny thing right? The other day someone came to me asking about crypto so I told her a few things to start looking at to try and understand crypto. She then came back and said she would want some XRP, because its price is still really low and it might go to 1000 or also 10000 just like BTC. You don't have to understand the technical side, but these comments are found here way to often and this is simple economics..  
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:46:36
Little reassurance: the future is still a long way to go. You have made a very bright decision to enjoy your debt free life now. Thanks for all the explanations! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:17:39
I find it very scary that the old saying “When even shoeshine boys are giving you stock tips, it’s time to sell” is getting true at this right moment. I don't get my shoes polished, but people who do not know anything about investing are looking into buying BTC. They say for different reasons, but of course it is for the profit (just like we do too). 
I sold 1/3rd of my portfolio to cover my initial investment and will let the rest ride it out. If we drop I will increase my holdings probably. If we rise, well that would be nice! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:51:07
Why would these exchanges shutdown then? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:25:35
This is even a better compromise than OP's one! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:34:30
We broke 9950 now though! Lets see what happens next 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:23:05
I;m gonna keep my eye on your posts from now on! 
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:55:55
You are doing the exact same thing based on your knowledge of bubbles. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:39:34
I use Bittrex, but it's only useable if you exchange to BTC or USD, not EUR. Coinbase is a nice alternative too
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:38:12
And that's what I am saying. You wouldn't reach that point ever
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:59:29
Without those people BTC would be worth what it was worth in the beginning, basically not much. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:03:10
And then what after 20-25 years? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:53:23
I actually sold 1 minute before this crash, which was luck, but I would have been really smart buying back 2 minutes later... 
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:39:06
You're in a very dangerous place if you are ignorant or stubborn enough to not believe that crypto can be a bubble despite it's technology. Now before you all start attacking me, I am heavily invested in crypto, but that doesn't mean this can't be a huge bubble. 
The enormous growth of this market has all signs of a bubble, but we do not know in which stage it is. However, what is different is that this market also corrects itself from time to time, down to 50% sometimes! 
I believe in crypto and it's goal to maybe overtake fiat one day, but these types of memes are very out of place. 
Look at the growth of this market in one year and then look at the growth of all bubbles in the past. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:39:05
Assume this is true.. this guy is rich lol
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:44:10
If it is on Bittrex it might be people pulling out because they had some connectivity issues just a 15 minutes ago
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:14:09
Why don't you ask them those questions? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:47:31
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:58:01
If lets say BTC is at 3000$, for how much can you then buy it? Because here in the Netherlands I can only find it for 3120 because most exchanges charge 4% fee or higher 
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:15:29
It started as a typo yes! Later people came up with hold on for dear life
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:39:03
I'm just starting to look into buying BTC's but as far as I understand there is no risk in the fork coming? As long as you buy now and hold until it is clear which 'chain' is winning. Correct me if I am wrong, but if that's the case then why not hop in now? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:34:17
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:14:03
Why would you sell at 600 loss? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:25:17
He buys back when dips go under sale price. So if he sells 5 at 3000. It rises to 3100, but then drops to 2900 he might buy those 5 back. Nothing happens to the rest of his stack (20). And he makes money on those 5, while still having 25 BTC at the end of the day. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 06:58:07
It really depends on what your goal is to gain from bitcoin. I am, just like you probably, unsure about what will happen the 1st of August and would hate to see BTC drop. However, I decided to invest in two coins and hodl them for a couple of years. I accept the fact that they could drop to 0, but that's because the potential gains are so high that I am willing to leave these coins alone until 2022 for example.
If you're looking to make a quick buck you are better off selling before the 1st of august. Monitor what happens with the price after that date and then decide to rebuy. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:50:39
Exactly, plus a small note: diversifying works for everything in life. Sure the potential win will be lower, but you will risk less. Over a lifetime that's actually a better approach for the average people like us. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:47:29
I might sell them if the price will rise again coming weeks, because I expect it will drop near the 1st of August. Perfect time to buy some more
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:38:03
People are just impatient while joining something new they do not understand. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:52:06
Ah ok thanks for that input! 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:05:41
As far as I understood: 1st of August is the deadline for a decision, so sure could be happening earlier then
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:05:08
This is called speculation and is close to gambling. You or me don't know if this will happen. It might climb to 4000 and then drop 30% to 2800 to only start Climbing afterwards. You will never see your coins back then..
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:06:46
Wow that's heavy. Where are you from?
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:47:31
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:47:53
Based on? Because BTC won't be lost right? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:32:22
That's the hidden message in my post though. Stay away from hypotheticals, not the balls on your grandma ;) 
If you want to rule out gut too you're best off buying a fixed amount every day/week/month. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:49:16
Simple decision. Do not even bother buying 1 BTC, if you decide to invest then spread your money over BTC / LTC and maybe one more. Never bet on one horse! 
Take the trip though
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:32:03
I don't get it (I'm Dutch), but why would this be a problem? You don't want to pay taxes is that it? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:20:27
What if the price will grow to 4000 end drop to 3000 at the end of july? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:18:57
Try buying other fiat currency, takes you longer probably.
Anyway, cryptocurrency is still in development and they are aware of the speed. That's why 1 august is happening.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:08:18
I don't know, started looking into crypto currency since yesterday. Didn't buy any yet, because I don't understand it well enough. As far as I can tell the 1 of August Bitcoin is going to change. You should read into it because I can't explain it yet 
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:41:10
Remind me! 1 year
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:20:32
Just spent some on LTC and buy some more BTC!
