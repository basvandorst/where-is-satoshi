Germanys internet is not near as  good as your saying. I've got 16Mbit Down, 1 Up.
I don't even know anybody who has more then 10 Up, und that is extremely rare. Max Down I know of is 100Mbit, but most they ever get is closer to 70.

I'm on your side. I think the higher block size limit is the right step to make. I just don't like your argument ;)
A lot of small nodes won't be able to run anymore, I'd say thats a fact. How bad is that? Probably not so bad, because those nodes couldn't add that much to the network before anyways.

I just started running a node a few days ago on an i3 6100, so not really comparable.
Syncing took about 12 hours or so. It's running Ubuntu headless, so no GUI.
Seems fine to me, not a very expensive system after all.

I have a 100Mbit Connection, so that probably helps a lot. Is your i7 under heavy load while syncing?

40$ a Month is A LOT.
Im currently running a Node on my Desktop PC, don't notice anything (Except for High Ping while gaming).
(It's quite powerfull though - i7 3770k @ 4.4GHz, 16GB RAM, but only DSL16k connection)
The Blockchain is saved to an HDD, not SSD.
Right now I have 23 aktive connections of which at at least one is pulling the blockchain - my upload has been at max for an hour or so (Only 130kbyte/s).
I have read of VPS for 5$ capable of hosting a Node.

Well, for Semiconductors Gold is a really, really bad Thing. Great as Bonding wire though

Something is rushed if it isn't ready yet, not if it already took a lot of time. It's about quality.
Thats timeless.

Then it most likely isn't visible.
Is it running within a LAN? If so, did you set up port forwarding?
