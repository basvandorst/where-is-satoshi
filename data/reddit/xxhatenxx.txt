Just to chime in I use Bank of America and I surprisingly have never had an issue with wires, ACH or  credit purchases with debit or credit.
Two things that could be happening to you is 1 something’s flagged to you specifically with the Bank or a simpler reason could be the fraud defense. A few times I have had to confirm the coinbase purchase was me via text and then retry and it goes through. 
Just sharing my experiences 
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:50:15
Because Bcash is not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:08:18
I use both Gemini and Coinbase 
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:24:02
Thanks for sharing this. I hadn’t heard. I also will be moving away from PIA

I could be wrong but that’s not how I understand it. From what I have gathered you can carry losses indefinitely but only up to 3500 a year.
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:17:31
While I got the humor this is fucked up

Good Gemini is much better 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:41:32
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:34:00
No we can not. Coinbase is done for a lot of people the way they handled this and the shit surround it. 
I as well as I’m sure a lot of other have closed their accounts and won’t be using them anymore
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:34:08
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:24
There are currently wire delays. I have been using Gemini my opinion even before today is they are 1000x better
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:57:05
Not salty just bad Business. The way they handled all this is shady as F

He means because you can instantly deposit into gdax wallet and withdraw from there without paying a fee
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:21:27
I think you meant to say Bcash
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:53:04
I have transferred in and out large and small sums with no problems as recent as today.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:43:15
Using Gemini and Binance.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:34:53
Gemini is 1000X better
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:28:32
I also have nothing but good thing to say about Binance. I know solely use it for trading.
If you do sign up consider pulling a referral code from the Random Generator.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:32
You can buy like ok Coinbase but they don’t really have a robust way to trade like an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:33:01
It’s the way the whole thing went down. Has nothing to do with the coin the alt coin they added. I’ve been hoping for them to add alts for a while now

Incognito brings up bitcoin.org for me

Whole lot sell walls to eat before 7k
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:09:36
Click bait. Takes you to an ad
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:39:02
That could be an issue. I have been verified on coin-base for years.
Gemini took about 2 weeks but that was at the beginning of the year.
Any other way like localbitcoins will result in paying a premium. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:15:53
They have approved sellers lists. I bought mine off amazon and haven’t had any issues .
You can inspect the chips if you want
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:51:19
I don’t see how anyone could look at BCH and not see it for what it was the last few days or in general for that matter. 
The problem a controversial fork will always have is it always being associated with a off Brand and while it may taste the same it will never sell for the same or taste the same as the Brand named version
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:51:51
Gemini is awesome. I have had good luck with coinbase also though. I use Gemini dominantly 
You can verify add account info and purchase then it’s immediately available on Gemini to buy and trade but you will not be able to transfer out till it clears .
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:05:13
You would need to roll the 401k into a self directed IRA.
I used a loan to buy bitcoin against my 401k against advisement and it’s worked out extremely well. This could just be timing &amp; luck though 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:35:57
If you are solely interested in bitcoin wait for the fork then buy. 
If your wanting to get into trading and having both coins wait till it drops a few hundred into the 7k or 6900 range
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:45:52
We talking about trading or Buying?
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:38:24
... and then it crasssshed
Great video man
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:53:38
Switch to Gemini

This comment made my day
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:03:28
I’ve used BofA for years with no issue 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:56:17
Pretty sure they will freeze your account for this indefinitely 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:19:26
I already own bitcoin. This is more of project to see the use and how easy I can only spend bitcoin. I convert 50% of my salary every 2 weeks into bitcoin and have been for a while now. 
I could just fund the vacation normally but wanted to go this route.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:11:12
I just had a loan fee of $75 and then my interest that goes back into my 401k so it worked out really well. 
I think what the other poster was getting at is if you took a early disbursement you would have quite a bit in fees and taxes however this is not the case with a loan against your 401k. My plan only let me loan out 50% of my balance. 
Again if you want to roll it into a self directed IRA you can do that also but only if you no longer work at that company. What I did is kept my 401k how it was and converted my existing IRA into a self directed and now I will just buy through that.  
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:26:50
Interesting thanks. I’m in one of those states and was in the 320k range and haven’t been accepted yet
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:08:53
This is actually a good thing 
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:53:32
Do you know roughly what number you were in the wait line?
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:29:14
The amount of people that are ok with this is ridiculous! Name another single non illegal thing any cc bans the purchase of?
It’s not about “you shouldn’t be buying on credit anyway” it’s about banks determining what you can and cannot spend money on how is anyone ok with this?
Genuine question?
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:50:24
Again it’s not about that. I use my cards for everything including my rent each month and pay it off in full monthly. The rewards and not having the international charge is another reason I chose to use cards over debit 
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:47:24
Isn’t this old ?
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:07:42
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:49:04
If my friend pays me on time and I’ve never had issues then yes I certainly would. 
I used credit cards for points and the no international charges. There isn’t a single purchase that is blocked by credit card companies the things people are mentioning are not accepted from the merchants due to chargebacks. Maybe there is more of an issue with people buying and charging back that I’m not aware of but this still pisses me off as someone who has used Credit Cards Responsibly.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:48:09
Oh it’s also scammy Bcash site
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:30:30
Using a credit card to buy crypto is not spending money you don’t have as someone who has made cc purchases on coinbase and paid said purchase back in a responsible manner it’s bs
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:23:26
I have only sent from Gemini to my Bank. I was always worried to try coinbase Wires since they were always delayed
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:55:22
Crazy I signed up on Jan 26th was 500,000 something and moved money that is in limbo expired state and still haven’t been approved. Also live in one of the states they are currently servicing.
I sent a email asking what’s up
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:57:39
To my knowledge there is not an app. Using a browser will work
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:24:28
I know this its just for me it wasn't worth it going all in on btc like I did the prior forks because I would have made more just sticking with my alts. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:45:49
I’ve used my cc at casino so that one is incorrect and I also have purchased lotto tickets at some places.
The difference is the places you mentioned aren’t allowed on the receiving end not the credit card end.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:21:24
I could see it at least hitting 7k before the fork. Even with this thought i still stayed in alts smh, when will I learn
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:04:45
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:32:02
This redirected me to an ad page
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:58:01
I would also recommend setting up an account on Gemini and submitting the verification if that’s what you want
I have been nothin but happy with the Ledger but coinbase has never given me issues either. If you sign up for the shift card it’s nice also.
