Actually the safecoins are the lifeblood of the network, read this little intro: 
Read more here: 
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:14:31
Yep def on Git  
Haha not uploading my time machine schematics at the moment, just some photos.
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:11:45
Yep and currently only running a couple hundred digital ocean droplets I believe.
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:07:31
I wouldn't trust that they have not planted trojans.
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:10:37
Yep. 
So just for anyone else wondering. It is a different network. It is not the WWW clear net. So you have to download the launcher to get onto the SAFE network to see anything on that network :)
Here are a few "sites" you can look at once on the network:
For anyone having issues head on over to the forum and the guys will help. They're a helpful bunch  
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:12:18
I have only been following it for a year+ but from what I can see its full steam ahead. I DL'd the launcher and demo app just the other day had a play around, everything worked seamlessly for me. But good to hear your thoughts.
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:38:47
Did you use the launcher?
Works fine for me.
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:32:01
Launched this  lol
Then uploaded some public and private photos.
I plan on running a vault and farming coins once they release this part of the alpha which I think is due 23rd or 24th of this month.
Im no expert but I see this as a winner no matter what happens to it. It's almost destined to succeed. The thing has not even finished Alpha and they already have guys working on messaging apps, sharing apps, websites, browsers etc. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:49:26
And completely blockchainless. Not to say its better or worse but different. EDIT - They have a holding coin currently called MAID until they switch over. I bought about 21K a while back, traded in and out now I only have about 10K :( lol
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:10:55
Unsure. I guess maybe it's not 100% about the coin. Maidsafe is a network first and a coin second.
@_date: 2016-08-17 10:10:55
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:35:04
The butt.
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:01:43
You didn't look deep enough did you?
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:03:48
Haha! I have heard that David Irvine is a bit eccentric.
Alpha is released and things are moving quickly from what I can tell.
You can D/L and have a play already.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:08:16
He literally admits he knows nothing about it.... 
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:43:29
There's no way btc will do what team Maidsafe are doing with SAFE NET those guys are a decade ahead. They're literally building the most secure version of the internet. Completely 100% decentralized, with actual content, websites and apps that isn't just drugs and sex and with an in built coin. Amazing.
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:45:33
The nsa is bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:13:23
The problem is PP manages your money and they do a bad job at it. With btc I manage it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:35:09
I suppose it's stupid but doesn't necessarily mean your going to get scammed especially if it's only like a buck and you don't put more into that wallet plus the thief would have to be pretty quick and if you received your Wallet and money is missing you could report to eBay or PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:21:51
That's so smart 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:30:59

I hope you guys do it with the pineapple folks

I have nothing to add except that I know a guy who has no bank account he is paid in BTC and spends in BTC so I paid him like 700 bucks about a year ago to do some web work for me, im  guessing thats like 3K in todays BTC
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:47:15
It's been said that bitcoin could even be ran and stored on Maid safes safe network. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:23:51
No. Just no. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:55:55
My response every time some idiot friend of mine tells me it's dropped a great deal is always the same. Now is the best time to buy.

Dog chews up Trezor with remaining btc... 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:46:51
Increases in bitcoin also means increases in alts but also means traders now going to be trading with the big boys 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:57:37
Apologies if this offends anyone, this is just how we talk, we're actually really good friends. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:30:35
Hence why MaidSafe coin AKA SAFE coin will take off like a you know what
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:26:27
Alex Jones was right.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:22:08
 needs to be shared everywhere and by everyone.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:22:52
Yep and this is why they are freaking out about technology like MaidSafe's SAFE Net.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:24:11
This is why I prefer MaidSafe's SAFE net.
@_date: 2019-03-06 04:58:24
Hes pumping and dumping hence the gradual buy. I guarantee you once he has his target share he will pump the absolute Fuck out of it, when that happens watch for the dump. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 08:34:50
Lol. This is so absurd. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 08:37:45
Jack has gone fully into the pump and dump rabbit hole.
@_date: 2019-03-21 08:40:28
His intentions pure? Bahahahaha mate he's been buying a Fuck ton bit by bit enough to fly under the radar not cause any short term pump and able to still buy at a really good price.... Give it 6-12 months and he's going to PUMP the tits off it! 
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:52:15
Fuck yeah!
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:56:10

 SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:08:49
Oh no I am not pushing them, the opposite they are asking me. But when it comes time to the crunch these hurdles comes up.
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:06:48
I feel your pain bro.  Same sich here. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:40:20
Correct. In all wars the first and last things that happen is resources like gold get fought over and confiscated or plain stolen.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:35:28
Just thought I'd also say it's not a coincidence I have bananas in the picture..and I'm high as Fuck right now. Cheers back to you.
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:51:07
Mate I don't even know what half this shit means lol 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:40:09
I trade
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:53:26
15K daily limit? Not that I plan to sell that much just interested. Sounds good, fast and simple like BTC was always meant to be. I like it and will likely use the service.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:30:07
I love bitcoin and yes I've upvoted but she's talking about Maidsafe. Maidsafe was designed with scalability Into it.  It is a network a private and secure one with the currency as the oil in the network.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:20:20
Holy shot holy shot holy shit
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:03:37
It was a joke dumbass
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:17:38
Was only clear to me after going through the accounts process.
From memory this page was not like that only a short while ago (weeks maybe? have checked Internet Archive but of no use) and at that time I had decided to look into it, this info was not made available so when I signed up recently I found out. IMHO this should be plastered all over the site and visible on every page and especially at sign up (it's not). So yeah you are right I should of double checked when I signed up but they should put about 2 times the effort into letting people know because it is also implied that a broker offers a buy and sell service without reading anything. If I as the customer can easily miss that, there is a problem and IMO they are deliberate not plastering it everywhere and especially not at sign up so that they do not lose signups and future business.
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:14:08
That's what I would of thought but I'm a dumb-ass like you apparently 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:27:22
Lel I know a guy that has no bank account gets paid in btc and pays for everything in btc.... I assume I will know 10 more guys like this in the next couple of years 
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:41:27
No that's for English people who think they are like cool Australians.  Kind of like how Australians drink coronas and Mexicans just laugh at us.

If you have an idea of time you need to figure out who you got them off, when, did you go through an exchange, a forum and most importantly what machine did you use at the time. If you still have the original computer it's very likely we can recover... obviously if I help you I want a Ferrari lol. JK but PM if you feel like.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:26:44
I hear ya.  But really if you follow it it only really cranked on a couple years back before that it was just David Irvine the crazy bastard. Once they got funding they hired debs and it's been progressing really fast since then and they have continued to hire more and more I believe there is about 20+ debs now. And we have to remember these guys aren't building a block chain they are building a private self encrypted peer to peer network which has farming vaults and safecoin alk tied in. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:13:28
Not sure why everyone is giving you a hard time. Sensible thinking is a good reminder. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:54:45
And if you opt for that decision I think anyone doing it is making a mistake this time. Not even close to the same fork. This is a huge gamble which could kill BTC value and the new coin. Potentially. Why risk it I think.
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:13:26
How are Polo fairing in all of this?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:35:50
Lol Fuck that guy
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:21:25
I am a bit confused? Who am I selling to? You or another peer? How much can I deposit and sell upto? Surely you have a limit? Seems almost too good to be true.
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:03:32
This is gonna bring a whole bunch of new money in...mwa ha ha ha ha.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:22:40
Why don't they highlight the damn changes and additions?!
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:19:09
This is what Maidsafe is by default. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:51:54
No I'm in a trade, that mainly lol.
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:07:26
Obviously. My point is; do we know what the changes will be? Because if they mess with BITCOIN (BTC) I think it might bite them in the ass.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:37:37
Lol is this satire. Paypal is the exact fucking opposite of everything we love about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:56:47
Question what will the new coin be called and what with Bitcoin (BTC) be designated as? Will there be any changes etc? Will it be like Etehereum where it gets designated Bitcoin Original and the new one is something else? Just seems to me the brand power of BITCOIN (BTC) is huge and this could be a problem.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:17:49

Not comparing the currency. Comparing the process to "invest" in something. Thx.
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:12:28
Thanks. I think for the start i'll buy it for them using local BTC, because thats just where I usually buy from but then if they want to buy more once I have them in the door ill point them there. So far my explaining has been along the lines of "look guys, if you want to buy shares, you gotta go to a bank, open an account if you dont already have one, provide ID, get some capital, open an account with their brokerage firm, learn some shit, download some software and then deposit funds, get some more checks done and the your OK to go..." similar deal here only it's actually a lot quicker.

Nah bro craft beer is for people that like fairy tales and live in wonderful realities hence the names.
I have travelled a little bit (through my bottle shop lol) and I can tell you the best beers in the world in my opinion are European in particular German, Belgian, Polish etc. And traditional pilsners are my personal favourite. In terms of local Australian beer an ice cold VB on a hot day there is nothing better and the sales tell the same story to the point most places where I live now no longer even have to stock it in the windows, they just keep it out back because they know real drinkers will walk back there and get it passing all of the expensive fancy shit on their way. 
You're looking at a beer that's been around for 164 years (VB) perfectly crafted over that time. This new shit has been around for barely a decade (some of it more of course) depending on the beer youre looking at and here is the thing the colors and the cloudiness and that and the tastes this is amateur shit for the most part like you can literally go buy a home brew kit and your beer will taste very similar and look similar to many "craft beers" you know why? Because it's easy to come up with that flavour, these are default settings when making beer. The real art comes down to points of a degree of temperature in fermentation and then chilling that beer through the entire process afterwards again to within points of a degree of Celsius, the supply and selection of the water and the hops its crazy the amount of work these guys put into it and you have these micro breweries making craft beer with fucking filtered tap water and hops they buy from farmers who have been growing the shit for only a few years or worse from chinese hops pellets c'mon seriously the macro breweries have their own supplies of water Raderberger brewery has its own century old wells FFS and it's own farms that it's been growing its own exact same fucking hops for which they hire biologists to fucken check on, seriously bro. 
What a rant I know. I just hate when bearded hipsters try telling me their IPA that's been around for 5 years and brewed in some rented out shed is better then some shit thats been sold for 200 years to millions of people around the world.
And i'm not all VB fuck no. WHen it comes to Aussie beers you can't beat shit like Coopers they make a brilliant beer, you want some real pale ale, this bitch is fucken pale ale history in Australia. James Boags, Cascade, Melbourne Bitter and if i'm going to fuck with some shit like craft i'll have a James Squire but only one or two. 
But anyway these are just like my opinions man, lol, go look up the sales. All that matters really is that Americans make the worst beer lol.
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:59:27
Why is it so hard man, I thought bitcoin was instant internet money?
Why cant I use paypal bro, I can buy anything online with paypal man?
Why do I need an account? Send them what, my ID?

My thoughts too on polo
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:30:16
So are we suggesting bitcoin core and miners are working together? And if so who cares?  That's the beauty of bitcoin. Do what you want decentralized like a  mother fe'r
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:08:21
I been bitcoining for some years. Buy Sell is easiest on Local BTC for small amounts under 5K. Lots of people telling me to use a bunch of different service which I plan on sussing out. Typical shit Aussies last to get involved in anything new and revolutionary.
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:19:34
I meant to say what you are describing sounds like Maidsafe. Omni was just a holding mechanism for the current token. But SAFE coin the future will be entirely different. If I am not mistaken safecoin will be the first ever non blockchain coin.  You really should look into what the team at Maidsafe are building. I think you'll be surprised.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:04:45
Thanks mate will do.
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:12:09
Difference is we can see into the future now.

Yep it'll move back to all alts again.  That's just the natural ebb and flow. I'll be buying a ton of Maid.
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:49:24
go back to the time you emailed yourself and see what wallets and sites where popular at the time. That or pay for some hypnosis regression lol. good luck.

Good points
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:33:32
Me again. I don't know if I get that feeling though. There is way too much there. If they were going insolvent why would they fill that with so much legal mumbo jumbo. Why wouldn't they just target the specific areas they would be worried about with litigation.... or why not just run. lol
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:32:19
Fuck the NYA.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:41:30
My strategy put all my money into different ALT's right before. Couldn't give a crap about whatever crap coin will come out of this just like I never gave a crap about the free crap coin they gave away with the last one.
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:45:26
There are plenty. My brother uses one to buy his bitcoins in Aus.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:20:11
That makes zero sense. Nothing is free bro.
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:55:48
problem is many in crypto are just as dodgy as the banks, BTC was supposed to be instant (its not but could be), its supposed to be free and fee-less (it's not but could be).
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:44:25
But that's the point 
@_date: 2019-02-27 00:21:21
Lol youre insane. Firstly not white. But even if I was what does someones colour or sexual orientation have to do with anything? I think you've just proven my point for me. Youre morw concerned with appearance and sjw garbage and you actually come across as prejudiced than you do being a good Dr. I might report you for those comments actually. Screen shot taken. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:45:38
Lol are you still going on about my skin colour? You realise you are insane? Why don't you worry about your patients instead of arguing with random strangers online about the colour of their skin... Who cares what I think, why does it upset you so much and so easiky.... I gotta go dude I'm busy. All the best don't get your knickers in a twist it's just an opinion on Reddit.

@_date: 2017-11-28 03:42:23
No doubt. But every large mile stone that I have seen has been met with lots of sells. You gotta understand there are many people who have planned their sell out at 10k. 
There will be a dip shortly after then rise well past 10k IMHO. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:30:39

@_date: 2017-11-20 02:19:54
Fukn legend. I got to about 21k doge then lost it all. I have the feeling all online casinos are dodgy unless it's a live stream. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:26:51
Shut up. Homo. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:19:00
Right. So solar, wind and battery cells. I'm thinking cooling is going to be an issue too....i might have to go underground where the temp is more stable or build a really thermally efficiency room? 
@_date: 2019-02-27 07:24:04
Lol youre insane... I must be the brownest white guy there is. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:10:05
Lol awesome 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:28:27
Fuck. No. We know who created bitcoin. Zero mystery. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:28:51
I didn't dv you BTW. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:49:58
Makes sense. 
If there's anyone technical in the Melbourne area hit me up let's build this thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:55:36
True story : I've been trying to explain to the Mrs about Bitcoin since 2013 and only getting away with a hundred bucks here three hundred there etc.... 
She hears them talk about bitcoin on her favorite chicks top 40 douchey station she listens to and she rings me immediately telling me I can invest our savings..... FML....  4k in now plus what I already had......  But it's all good. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:45:26
Aight bro you got me. My face is all kinds of spherical. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:37:35
It's not luck.
@_date: 2019-02-26 11:22:08
I love bitcoin but seriously...perhaps your Dr should be more concerned with the health of his patients instead of Bitcoin or Mario.

You're a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:20:56
But can't you mine all sorts of stuff so long as its blockchain? Means you could switch it up right? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:43:51
Not value, transactions so yes you were way off :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:12:07
This. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:24:52
Thanks.  Suppose I meant actual trash surfers. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:44:18
Same thing happened to me. Over 13 single colour spins in a row.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:19:50
Thanks dude. When I was doing it years ago you had to calculate all this on your own. Lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:11:11
I tried to warn everyone especially the noobs of this the other day. Most people tried to tear my post down. It's only natural every single milestone thus far has been followed by a dip because people real investors and traders have planned their sell at X point so that's exactly what they do and then you get the amateurs who get spooked and follow. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:11:50
Wow theres a lot of shit talk here. The community is coming togther. Ughh no. There just wasn't enough consensus. Not the first, not the last.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:16:14
Isn't the idea that you mine alts too? And I believe once Maidsafe comes online you can farm that without special hardware... 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:17:06
That's awesome where snouts are you?

I think too many people assume Google employees are all geniuses. Probably 50% or more are non-native English speaking and many have unprofessional data review and sales jobs. Basically normal people. Normal people make fuck ups and they probably have no clue what they are looking at most of the time. Just report the ads.

@_date: 2017-11-13 21:30:37
Nothing there was supposed to be a girl in the code it did not have consensus so a bunch of miners decided "to teach bitcoin a lesson" and so they pumped and dumped a forked bitcoin alt called bitcoin cash and in so doing opened btc up to further potential attacks. We're our of the eye of the storm now and it's pretty much passing. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:44:06
How much?
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:37:44
Couldn't agree with you more. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:43:50
I'm in Australia so obviously I can't call but for those on the fence about making a call: it makes a huge difference believe me. Pick up the phone and call. It's not in the slightest intimidating they're just people. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:52:22
As much as I agree I hate to add that it's perfectly legal and the crypto sphere we have built was built to allow it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:12:05

@_date: 2016-09-08 22:24:13
Haha I was one of the first kids in my town to get the Internet. My dad was an electrical engineer in the Navy and we have always been early adopters of everything and yes that includes Bitcoin and OB. Problem with OB is it has too many flaws to name. OB could fix those flaws IMO if it partnered up with someone like Maidsafe... hint hint.
@_date: 2019-01-08 10:28:36
Lol. You don't need fiat mate. There's a ton of people living purely on crypto. It's getting easier daily. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 09:01:20
I have no idea how something like this might play out. Didnt they stop them from pulling more than like a couple hundred euros out at a time in the Greek crisis a few years back?
@_date: 2019-01-08 10:04:41
How are they idiots?
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:16:43
Don't know but do you think there is even a market for this? I am in the solar hot water industry in Australia and I  think if we offered Bitcoin even with national press releases we'd struggle to get even a few orders and at these high costs would come greater chance of loss through volatility and so hence you'd have to prop the price up somewhat significantly I'm thinking roughly at least a hundred or more dollars. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:41:16
Stupid ad. Oh finally. Lol. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:14:25
I'll agree with you on the point of destruction. However they've mostly not been destroying private stuff if we're going to be honest. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:19:12
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:15:56
I've never had a major issue. I suppose I don't understand. Sorry.

Lol. I don't own any BTC brother. I'm all about the MAID :)
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:10:40
Wow massive didn't get the chance to read most of it but I am in Australia and can tell you it's hard to get good local Nootropics here. Obviously you can buy from US but it comes at a pretty huge cost. My brother and I considered touching base with a couple big names overseas to see if we could be their Australia New Zealand distributor.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:56:10
Fuck dips as a regular Joe the advice I gave to my older brother was think of it like saving so Every week when you get paid just buy $50-$100 or whatever you can afford and keep piling it up in five years time that will amount to a lot. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 01:43:01
That last part and the technology side is kind of the problem. My idea for security is not ready yet so I'd have to cold store.
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:17:45
So like for example the idea would be to set up a brokerage with a small contact centre that would essentially cold call but also set up some online leads for folks interested and essentially target the mom and pop average Joe and Jane. Upsell options could be secure storage, reports etc. PM me if interested I'm brainstorming guys. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:27:45
nice move home boi
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:07:45
So we are looking at the big well known brands. We thought about touching base with onnit but for some reason they don't want to distribute internationally and I am currently trying to set something up with mind lab pro. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:11:27
Cash is mostly used to not pay tax. Cash is almost not suitable. Bitcoin on the other hand... 
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:37:43
And this is my point pretty good not the best but good. Could it be better heck yeah but no one has hacked polo as far as I can tell and not many stolen coins either because of their stringent process. I'd rather have my withdraw held up for a day as compared with lower security and more risk. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:41:23
Hmm It seems they are definitely solvent because as you and others have said many are withdrawing large sums regularly but also when they pretty much invited people to withdraw their funds and close their accounts if they didn't agree with some of their new terms made me think the same. I doubt they are too rich too care because they did shut their troll box to specifically move resources into support etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:11:39
 
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:23:34
Well done very cool. Any business that supports btc should get as much free exposure as the community can offer IMHO as it benefits all of us. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:46:00
I got my bro onto crypto. He's just buying through a broker and storing in his wallet as investment. I'm sure there are ten's of thousands of people like him.

We're all delusional Man!!!!!!  Haha 
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:27:37
How do you do this without killing your profits? Bitcoin is volatile as heck do sure if you're a giant Corp but if it's a small business you need every profit you can get and that means livelihood. How can you buy food or pay bills if you offer a discount and a week later when you go to with draw some money btc is down 15% ?
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:15:46
I don't know what that means. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 05:41:31
Can you recommend a good platform for cloud mining or something similar. I want to get into mining.
@_date: 2015-04-02 05:31:00
Even for the cloud mining? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:55:02
I thought they had tabled legislation for crypto and we're treating it the same as capital gains. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:28:54
Yes even have come up with how to secure their btc. And a bunch of other services e.g. secure storage, regular reports, insurance, offer other coins, etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:08:00

@_date: 2015-10-16 03:46:30
Err no.... no really. All they are doing is buying your BTC off you and then sending the xfer $ funds to your PayPal, so PayPal have zero part in it.
@_date: 2016-10-02 00:20:25
D bank will die
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:38:23
Dude. I have no fucking clue. I opened an account with them because I wanted to pull my BTC into AUD hold it then re-invest after Aug 1 but after opening an account they tell me I cannot sell BTC for AUD (that's half their friggin service right there) and that they don't know when I will be able to.
@_date: 2015-10-09 00:20:06
1. What do you think about  ?
2. Did you create bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:52:41
Yes. But ETH at least for now. It's low and it will bounce back very quick. So not only is it safer than what you are currently doing but it's actually an opportunity to make some money.
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:48:48
I am so confused right now. Can someone explain the diff between BTC, BCC and BCH?
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:27:52
EXACTLY! Gold hit like 60K / KG only just a few short years ago. BTC in my opinion will be far more valuable than gold.
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:55:06
Divide 1 btc buy the amount of hardware mining it and holding it. lol.

Fuck no. Are these Aussie exchanges?
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:50:14
This is why I am buying alt's. ETH in particular. This is my strategy to make some coin. Buy historically strong alts when low as fuck like right now and sell when all the wimps buy it back.
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:30:12
I am in Australia. This is always our strategy. Worked well so far.
