The blocksize extremists have failed. Please stop terrorising the Bitcoin community by inciting radical extremist hardforks. I earn my living with Bitcoin and it works great. Stop threatening my livelihood!

There is not much worth commenting on. This however is the greatest threat Bitcoin has faced. The XT fork extremists could destroy Bitcoin. 
These extremists used to be sane and rational, as pointed out in this video. What has changed? Why has Gavin become an extremist and abandoned everything he previously stood for?

I'm not worried about larger blocks, I'm worried about XT fork extremists destroying Bitcoin.

Glad you agree.

I don't think anyone is against bigger blocks. It's the way this is being done. Gavin has completely changed and I find this disturbing.
Did you watch the video? Isn't his current approach of a PR campaign of FUD and threats of dictatorship totally contradicting what he says in the video? What happened to the meritocracy and the scientific method?

It's not FUD if everyone believes the FUD!
Seriously WATCH THE VIDEO. It's your GOD Andresen speaking LISTEN TO HIM LOL

 r/bitcoin is being overun with stupid or something is going on

Not really what? Without going into detail, I only use Bitcoin for the arbitrage I do. I use it daily and it works fantastic! I can confirm the sky is not falling. I always pay a fee because it is so cheap and would be happy to pay more.
You know most are for a size increase done in a sane way, right? There is a consensus process that has worked well for many years.
What I'm against is radical extremist hardforks that could destroy consensus and effectively kill Bitcoin. Do you understand?

The main character is a hacker and has a problem getting safe access to drugs... your right I cant see any scenario in which Bitcoin would be relevant to the show. It's totally unrealistic to think this guy would be aware of Bitcoin and TOR and darknetmarkets and then be capable to actually use these to safely access drugs. The plot of cliche drug dealer problems was much more realistic and very up to date for 2015.
