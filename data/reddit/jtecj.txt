I wonder if she get it correct?  Seems pretty obvious as only one of the answers are in a convertible unit of measurement.

Ok, perhaps that's the case, could be a simple misunderstanding on my part. I'm going to go for a walk and calm down now...

How large of an impact do you think your accepting bitcoin will have on NASCAR?  Do individual drivers(the talent) have much impact on the overall business side of things?  Have you received interest or curiosity from other drivers about what you are doing?  How many races or for how long will you be displaying the bitcoin sponsorship decal?

What I don't understand is if I walk into a sub shop that only accepts cash. They've kind of heard of credit cards but don't know what it is or how to accept it. I then go on to ask, have you thought about accepting visa?  Then go on to help them implement it if they are interested. Would that still be evangelizing?  Would people still tell us to leave them alone?  Is it seen as evangelizing because there is such a strong political culture currently behind the technology?
My example and question isn't meant to be rude or contrarian. I'm curious to hear people's opinions.

I don't usually post on reddit but rather lurk. In this case I have to step in. This video gets regurgitated every 6 months on here as though it's some grand new idea...please...no more...

I'm a huge supporter of bitcoin and have a very large investment in it. However, I have to agree with Kerzane's sentiment. Saying that bitcoin had recovered every time as some sort of example as to what it will do in the future is simply the psychological concept "normalcy bias" taking strong effect.

That my friend is the most important factor in current adoption, more so than education. People will, and often do, partake in things they don't understand. What we are missing in respect to the touch screen comparison is the iphone. Touch screens existed prior to the iphone but no one really cared. Apple had already a powerful brand name that let people know that they could feel safe investing in this new gadget. They also designed it significantly better than most touch screen technology that existed at the time. We need this. 
Short follow up, I don't think we are too far at all.  However, we may be expecting too much growth to happen too quickly. I think the fact that more and more investment capital is flooding in is sign enough that we are right on time.

I agree, should have stopped while you were ahead.

A few steps ahead of you, I tweeted at him a month or two back asking for my salary in Bitcoin, last night I sent him a tweet with a Bitcoin tip.

Thanks!  Thats my first tip! :)

This doesn't belong here.  Anyone can hold an opinion on bitcoin at the same time as doing millions of things that have nothing to do with bitcoin. Doesn't make it r/bitcoin related.

I'm guessing they are feeling bad for us at the current price : ).

Virgin would make a lot of sense, but don't count out T-Mobile.  We have a CEO that like Richard Branson is looking to disrupt things in as many meaningful ways as he can.  We also have without a doubt a large number of employees working on the inside to try and push the importance of adoption forward.

I will most definetly be taking advantage of this!

I don't believe that they are disagreeing with you as to the fact that Bitcoin acts this way.  I think they are approaching this from a more scholarly standpoint, wanting to know the "why" it acts this way.
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:18:33
Not sure why it got to me but it did and now I feel better. With respect to the clarification I'm going to delete my post.
I apologize if I came across rude.

The tweet I sent was simple, memorable and had Bitcoin attached. Perhaps what we need to do is coordinate and have everyone send the same tweet, all with small tips.
Here was mine:

At the end of the day does this matter in the least?  When I was five years old I asked my mother if she had "any waiters in her mind" because she was being impatient. Should that be used as some sort of tool to devalue my credibility when my opponent disagrees with me about stem cell research at the age of 60?  This was obviously posted because someone felt threatened, beyond that information I see no relative value as everything has changed in the proceeding years  of this video.

No one is claiming that money you leave in a coffee can for 78 years should be worth more when it is taken out.  Only that we prefer that it not be worth substantially less.  Those products did not themselves increase in price, rather it is the currency that decreased in value.  While more of the currency is continually created the value gets redistributed amongst the larger amount of currency in the system causing each individual unit to be worth less.  Meaning you need more currency to buy a house, car, cup of tea, etc.  This is nothing more than the inflationary vs deflationary currency debate all over again.

Probably would have helped to learn about it as a technology rather than a currency out of the gate. I think it’s much easier for someone to approach and not write off if they start with it’s future potential, you know, without the insane price making it look like a scam.

I'll never use this for that very reason.
