But if Warren sold his stocks, he would lose his company. His stocks are backed by the value of his company. What is bit coin backed by? One word: speculation.

I'm really not surprised that a convicted scam artist would be a major contributor to bitcoin. I'm a firm believer in "you get what you pay for," and what do you get when you pay for a bitcoin? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

Bitcoins are NOT assets. They're value is based on speculation. Once that speculation disappears, so does the value.

So the people selling them haven't arbitrarily raised their asking price?

The dollar, and other world currencies, are backed by government, regulation, and law. The bitcoin is not. The bitcoin is subject to artificial inflation; see the past month.

So you bought bitcoins for the sake of having them? Not to buy things anonymously? Which is the whole selling point...

Try 9x as value in one month. Prepare for the crash...

Could you imagine what he could do to the value of the bitcoin if he wanted to sell all 371,000 of his? He would become a millionaire and everyone else would be fucked out of their investment. Why does this sound soooo familiar? ::cough:: Enron ::cough::

What did you get in return for your $500?

In order to run a business in the US, by law, you are required to accept US currency (the dollar). No one is required to accept these bitcoins. If the "market" determines the value of a bitcoin to be $9 but none of the businesses who claim to accept them, actually accept a $9 bitcoin then the bitcoin becomes devalued. If the guy holding 371k bitcoins decides to sell them all at $1 per, the value of the bitcoin drops to $1. The value isn't backed by ANYTHING.
