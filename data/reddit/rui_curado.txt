I'm preparing an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) in roughly the same format as this idea: Mark Lane's Logs: Project H.U.M.A.N. ( and I'm also thinking of creating bitcoin honeypots.

That is very nice and helpful for merchants, but I have another question as a future merchant. I'm finishing a game that can be paid in Bitcoin ( BTW).
Now, if I get each new player's payment in a different address, I end up with a "fragmented" account: If I want to join all payments in a single address, I'll have to make a transfer from each and every address into the common address. If I add the common 0.0001 BTC fee, that could be a lot a BTC in fees!
Can I do the above (many addresses to one) in a single transaction?

Sometimes I open Multibit and I have no wallets there. This happens because I have my wallet file on a flash drive. If I forget to insert the flash drive when I start Multibit, it thinks the wallet is gone, erases the wallet list and creates a new, empty wallet. I just need to import the wallet file again, wait for synchronization, and voilá! Everything as before.
OP, do you have your wallet file on a folder other than the default? Make a full search for *.wallet files starting on the root of every drive you have. It doesn't hurt to try...

Before you go all screaming about how wrong I should be about being clean, I regularly do a full system scan by running two antivirus systems using their "rescue disks".

DIPP.CC games are viral in nature. Imagine a puzzle you must solve, but can only get 2 or 3 pieces. The other pieces are given to other players. How do you complete the puzzle if it's others who have them? You are selfish, you want to win the prize (in Bitcoin), you want it all. But you must share and you need to seek/recruit other players. If no one shares, no one can win. DIPP.CC is a platform of games that explore the social cooperate/compete dichotomy.

I'm talking about SEPA transfers (Europe) to/from Portugal. Even national transfers take 1 day. I know this is just a gimmick for them to make money, but every bank works like that. Of course, if I transfer to another person on the same bank, the operation is immediate, which is understandable. After all, the bank gains nothing in withholding the money in that case...

I have another (smaller) problem. I usually sell back in the same amount I buy, to make sure when I sell I don't sell lower. So, when I buy 0.1 BTC, I end up with 0.099 BTC due to their commision. Then I can't sell it back unless I add a bit more. Nothing special but forces me to do some additional math.

My suggestion is  . They never take your fiat money (USD/EUR). They only keep bitcons back and forth to secure the trades. You need to validate your bank account though. It will take two business days. After that, you can buy in a blink if you want. You have a trade limit of 2500 EUR before you need to validate your identity. Also, you can't take your bitcoins from them in the initial 14 days. After that, you're totally free.
Their commission is 1% in bitcoins, shared between buyer and seller.
I started there a week ago, made 5 trades so far and I like it a lot. SEPA transfers are free in Portugal so the only cost I have in trading is the 0.5% fee.

Remember that bank transfers might be really delayed. If I transfer my money after 4:30 p.m., it will only be processed next day. If I do it before that, it still will only be received by the seller next day. On weekends it's even worse. So, don't despair yet. Wait another day because he might be telling the truth. For instance, I sold Bitcoin last friday and I still don't have the money on my account , and that's perfectly normal!

When I say it's better in every aspect is just IMHO. I agree that if you want to trade anonymously, you simply can't. And yes, the fees could be better. But I like the way fiat money is out of their loop. They just make the Bitcoin escrow. If I want a bit more security, I can just trade with established traders.
