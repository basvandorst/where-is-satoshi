Klaus from Justcoin here. Sorry to see a Norwegian stuck at Mt.Gox. I would be happy to help you out by not charging a trade or withdrawal fee this one time if you are able to cancel your Mt.Gox withdrawal. Send me a mail at klaus if interested.

Great work and great news! As you might have read in the Scandinavian sub-forum on bitcointalk we (Justcoin) received a similar answer from the Norwegian tax agency in August, followed by a withdrawal of their statement earlier this month. Both the original statement concluding trading in Bitcoin is exempt taxation and the withdrawal of this statement can be found here: 
I am interested in getting in touch with you and possibly receive a copy of the documentation you have received from Skatterattsnamnden? It could be highly useful as a precedent when speaking to the Norwegian tax agency. My mail is klaus
I also posted this comment on bitcointalk but figured the link to the documents might also be of interest here. :)

Klaus from Justcoin here. Not gonna highjack this post, just clear up a few things!
You are right, anyone can sign up and use Justcoin. We just silently launched our BTC/USD market this weekend, thus the order book is pretty empty until deposits arrive. :) 
As for the trading fee, it is set to zero throughout 2013 for both BTC/EUR and BTC/USD.
And to Vault of Satoshi, good luck! There is plenty of pie for everyone and the quality of some of the major exchanges tells me competition is needed.
