What bank are you talking about exactly? Seems I'm not very attentive to what is happening around me :)

I'm happy that it's not like that in Ukraine yet. However, I've heard it's really hard to get USD or EUR in local exchanges, and black markets are in the full run.   
While it's not that bad yet regarding the prices here, I foresee the hardship of planning a trip to Europe for the New Year. I've decided that I'll be safe acquiring some Bitcoins and exploring the spots which accept them (in Berlin).
Still, the problem is that when you travel from Ukraine to the EU, you sometimes have to prove that you have enough finances to sustain yourself during a trip. In some cases, the customs people demand one to show your cash at the border. It's bad that showing the amount of Bitcoins in my wallet won't suffice.

there's also cex.io exchange, and they seem to be UK-based;
they also accept credit cards
@_date: 2014-11-21 12:10:59
well, it can be any other currency with a payment card, just with conversion fees
@_date: 2014-11-12 10:00:06
thanks a lot! (I thought for a second it might be PrivatBank..)
@_date: 2014-12-23 15:33:02
Oh, it doesn't matter what I have left after my trip. I meant that despite having Bitcoins, I might have to show some cash when I'm crossing the UA-EU border, and I was justing daydreaming that I could just show the BTC amount in my wallet :)
Thanks for the offer, I'm thinking about it! When will you be in Berlin exactly? I'm planning on being there 30th December till 8th January, not in Kreuzberg though, but it's not that large a city :)

I don't know. "We are used to Blockchain wallets" is what they said in an email :)

They are very good, and the entire plate is so big that you need to be really tough or hungry to eat it. The potatoes look and taste like home-made)
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:53:31
ok, will order it next time for sure!

I would totally buy a sci-fi or fantasy book, why not? Still, I have a nice collection of various books myself, so I imagine there won't be only a sci-fi selection.
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:29:59
Agree. This is how it's supposed to work, and this is how I believe it will work

We didn't really met people that into bitcoin. The waitress at the cafe said she knows nothing about it, but she seemed perfectly okay with it as long as it serves to raise interest to the spot. She didn't have a wallet herself, she preferred tipping in euro.  
The people at the cafe were joyfully bragging about something non-bitcoin related)  
The gentleman at the bookstore nearby knew how the payment works, but he was not into details. There were some other spots, like a tea shop which we would have visited had we got there earlier.  
I imagine the majority of those into bitcoin could be seen in the Devil's Kitchen, but I didn't go there this time.   
I know it was naive of me to expect seeing people with 'bitcoin' written all over them..) But I still expect to see some sort of community some next time in Berlin
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:41:52
It's amazing Ukraine is one of those countries! (never mind the fees..)
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:43:44
Yeah, a lot depends on the luck :)   
I'm not bragging, just sharing.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:28:25
Well, for me it was a quest worth experiencing. Despite it didn't turn out as smooth as expected, I enjoyed my time. While sidechains are a future prospect (as well as bitcoin being a decentralized wealth storage), and online payments are what I've had an experience with for some time now, I'll still be hoping for offline spots to start accepting the currency. There is a thrill in it.

A cool piece to have on a wall instead of a poster)  
I thought about a hand-painted T-shirt..  
Anyway, love acrylic paints!

Sorry, I don't know how it's implemented, but I'd really love to see an international marketplace which reaches Ukraine.. Especially if Bitcoins are accepted. Would totally love to spend my coins on books!
@_date: 2014-11-24 12:30:41
That's so awesome! Actually, the translation is not precisely correct, and the first sentence which goes like "In Medicover can no longer pay Cryptocurrency." is rather translated as "In Medicover it's possible now to pay with cryptocurrency."

Although this sounds a little bit overenthusiastic, I imagine that I'd love to hame something like that as a kid. It's like collectibles, but with certain value.  
Kids learn about economy on their own too, in some way - they assign value to items and trade them with other kids. Your daughter's items are rare and quite valuable - I'd make sure she doesn't trade her Bitcoin for some kids' stuff :)

On Sunday, I paid with Bitcoin for a dinner in Anker, a restaurant in Budapest. I would recommend them to anyone who goes to BP. (Don't miss a glass of red Bikavér wine, it's real good!) They have a 10% discount for those who pay in Ƀ.
For the first time, my transaction went as smooth as butter!
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:36:27
I know! That's my story as well!) I'll be looking into your project!

Looks like truth, from my personal experience. While the property has decreased in price in major cities, which makes it attractive for those capable of buying it, some of my friends have been looking in the Bitcoin direction. One of my best friends has made the first steps already – despite the fact that it's very expensive to buy BTC in Ukraine (the commission will be about 10%), he bought some. I cannot tell the same about my female friends though (unlike me, girls remain very skeptical).  
  
A little note:   
The last paragraph from the translation u/ShatosiMakanoto provided includes a link on the recent scandalous article about the Security Service guy who was talking about the necessity of blocking any accounts from which separatists may be financed. There was a mention of "various bitcoins", but no accent on cryptocurrency at all.

thanks, got an iOS device, and there is no BitcoinMap for it
@_date: 2015-02-07 07:33:31
sorry to hear it ('forcefully moved')..  
this thing just has to stop eventually some day.

I was asking for coinmap alternatives, as the info there is often old..  
places shown are not the ones you can buy something there when you are visiting as a tourist..
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:18:01
I know what you mean. Although it's about 4 times less in my currency (Ukrainian Hryvnia), I feel somehow more secure having my BTC around
@_date: 2015-02-21 00:21:30
oh, it might be that using an exchange (where conversion fee + card fee are applied) is more beneficial
@_date: 2015-02-07 07:20:00
My advice would be not to use those btcu/National Credit -related payment terminals. The nominal fee is 4 or 5%, but there is some other fee hidden, which makes it a total deduction of about 15% from your payment.  
(I did use one of them myself, had a fun time talking with the support guys, but lost about 7 to 9 euros on my 50 euro deposit. Going to try out the ATM thing in Lvivska Sq)
