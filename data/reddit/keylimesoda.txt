You can use a dedicated Linux distro like LinuxCoin. That would make your setup easier. 
That being said, I use windows 7 for mining and have had 99.99% uptime over the last couple months. 
Perf wise, I think Linux may have an edge if you're a hardcore tweaker, but if all you're doing is overclocking and messing with miner cmdline parameters, then I windows is easier and the drivers are more mature.

I may need some better optimizations for my 6990, but in current use I'd go for all 5970. 
That being said, good luck finding either card. I'm not sure how mining capacity will continue to grow exponentially when there's such a limited supply of high-end GPGPU units.

Again, I'm not shooting for exact. I am saying, even if we capture only some small part of existing Internet transactions, we're still an order of magnitude above where we are today.
And 10% of PayPal seems easy, understandable and achievable compared to Falkvinge's attempts at estimation against world currencies.

I think this is the route I'm going to go.  Seems the most straightforward, and gives some backup modes for robustness.
I'm still paranoid about the process of extracting keys from an old wallet without software reading my keys and sending them up to the internet.  I'm thinking of using a disconnected VM.

1a.  The goal is to make it difficult to consolidate power.  Assuming an ASIC-resistant proof-of-work (which we'll get to in a minute), then you're left to mining using CPUs.  A single miner, regardless of funding, would struggle to collect and manage a sufficient number of CPUs to get to a 51% attack, especially if everyone with a CPU is mining.
1b.  The goal is to use an algorithm that cannot be made orders of magnitude faster on ASICs.  ASICs will always be more efficient, but you can generate algorithms that negate much of their advantage over CPUs (require significant branching, rely on significant amounts of RAM, etc.)
- 
- 
2.  I think it would be a boon for the network as you'd see a whole rash of folks powering up their CPUs and participating once again.  You have that many more people significantly invested in the success of the system.  The people who would get hosed are people who invested heavily in ASICs (either making or mining).  The interesting thing would be to see if the ASIC community could exert sufficient clout to actually branch off and create a new forked coin.

Thanks mate!  Didn't realize it was my cake day until after I'd posted.
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:50:13
Good discussion!
1.  I use grandma here as a type. While many folks use bittorrent, most people of the younger generation still don't BitTorrent.  iTunes usage far outpaces BitTorrent broadly, and I'd venture to say they win each age group demographic as well.  BitTorrent is a pain in the arse. Either you use a public tracker with questionable content, or you have to go to the effort of joining a private tracker. Then you have to wait some indeterminate time for downloads, and then convert based on what file type your target device supports.  Or pay 99c and be done.
2.  I think we're getting semantic here. I agree that BitTorrent can play a part, but until there's an iTunes-easy way to live completely off the grid, it's not a key feature for mainstream bitcoin users.
3.  Deflation was a show stopper and nearly destroyed the USD. That's why they went to managed inflation.  I'd be happy to be wrong, but I suspect lack of central management may undermine Bitcoin as a long term currency.
4.  People can already avoid taxes by lying on their tax returns.  And the IRS deals with it with the threat of random spot checks.  Some folks will use bitcoin, thinking it absolves them of tax duty, only to get crushed by an audit and the message will be sent.  And it will undermine the credibility of bitcoin if we've sold it as easy tax-evasion.

He is obviously making an attempt to be balanced in his directing of the committee's discussion.  He deliberately pushing for the witnesses to provide balanced statements.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:13:36
It ends up being confusing, since most people still are hard-coded to value things in USD.
Ever messed around with Microsoft Points?  Same thing--they're something like 50pts/1USD.  So, I'm shopping around, and something is 800 MS Points.
Now look, I got a math degree in college, I can do the easy calculation, but it's a pain because my instinct sees "800 units of measure, must be equal to $8 of value", when in reality that stupid thing is $16.
I could retrain my brain to think in MS Points (and I mostly have), but it is still jarring for my instincts.  And it would be even worse to try with something like Satoshis which are still enormously volatile in their relation to USD.

I've thought his comments were balanced, his analogy to the original fear and possibilities around the early internet was appropriate.  I think he's been fairly balanced so far, especially given the context for the conversation.
You have to remember, this is our security team talking.  They're only talking about the security concerns.  This is not our economic committee.  I'd expect the economic committee discussion will have a very different tone.

The reality is, taxes are essential to a functional society.  We may not like them, we may not care for how or where they are administered, but every Econ 101 student knows the necessity of public goods.
The way to fix issues you have with the tax system is not evasion.  Evasion doesn't make you a hero or change anything--it just makes you a crook.  If you want to fix taxes, do the work--participate in government and lobbying and community work, etc.
It takes all the maturity and social conscience of a 10-yr old to say, "I'm not going to pay taxes, you can't make me, nee-ner nee-ner neeee-nerrrr."  If you don't like the system, don't run away to your cave.  **MAN UP** and *HELP CHANGE THE SYSTEM.*
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:41:07
I think if they're not given some levers of control, you'll see a larger attempt to remove the threat altogether.  And I don't think that's a great situation for Bitcoin or for consumers.
There's a moderate path here where we all win.  And I hope the bitcoin community can contribute to that solution.

Not totally true anymore.  Android base may be free, but the Google Play components that are required for the actual "Android Experience" are closed source unfree.
Saying Android is free (as in free) now is a bit like saying OS X is open source because I can download Darwin.  Well, sure, Darwin is the base OS X, but all the interesting bits of OS X are closed source.

Bitcoin still has some *major* structural shortcomings as a currency/payment system.  It's slow, has scaling issues, the block chain is growing more unyieldy by the day and at some point miners are going to start looking for higher fees for many/most transactions.
As an example, bitcoin is still orders ofagnitide away from being able to handle credit-card levels of transaction processing, and adding more miners won't necessarily solve the problem.
Hopefully many of these issues are worked out by the devs.  Until then, I agree with Marcus that Bitcoin has some liquidity issues that make it more useful as a store of value and a public ledger (Gold 2.0) than as a daily use currency/payment system.

Getting a robust, heterogeneous 51% is important to the vitality of the bitcoin community as it reduces points of failure or attack.

@_date: 2013-12-10 19:30:28
I'm open to correction here.  Isn't confirmation time important to trusting the transaction?  Otherwise, you open yourself up to fairly simple fraud?
The way I understand the network, your fee determines which miners choose to pick/prioritize up your transaction.  So, eventually, there will be some trade off between speed and the fee you're willing to pay.  How much will it cost 10 years from now to get reasonably quick confirmation?
If you were down voted, it may be because you offered criticism without information.  I'm open to learning here--I think we all still are.

They wouldn't even need to spend that much.
A few hundred million, used correctly, could completely crash the price, allowing for quick consolidation.

EDIT 2:  I'm not sure even 5+ billion would be enough to buy all the coins in the market because in the course of buying, you'd be pushing the price higher and higher.  Essentially the last coin would cost you the entire market value of bitcoin.

1.  Bitcoin will have a role to play in failing governments, but it doesn't have anything to offer my grandma in an already functioning economy.
2.  Most folks will never know how to go through all the steps you've mentioned.  Not to mention that any purchase you make involves dealing with someone else who could disclose your delivery address or your description, etc.  It's all but impossible to be faultless here, and one mistake will blow open your whole history. You'd be much better off with cash.
3.  While you're not all wrong here, there are certain issues, like deflation, that have teeth.
4.  Maybe some paranoid few will convert their entire monetary lives over to bitcoin, from salary to purchases, etc.  Maybe you could pull off a completely darknet existence, never touching USD.  But the vast majority of bitcoin users can't and won't, and that is only going to become more true moving forward.
You're correct in pointing out that bitcoin could play a part in an attempt at living a clandestine life.  However, it's a misnomer to bill it as anonymous and tax free to the average bitcoin adaptor who will never see those benefits without substantial additional work.  And most normal folks don't want to live off the grid anyways, so it's not a compelling selling point.

The difference is that we're reaching the endgame for processing power for bitcoin.
After ASICs, we're not going to see another "order-of-magnitude" kind of power jump for mining.
Now, if *everyone* could mine using ASICs, then we'd be fine and buffered against single entity attack (SEA).  The problem is that ASICs raise the barrier to entry for mining.  This in turn causes an increased consolidation of power.  You want every home to be mining bitcoin, and ASIC-friendly proof-of-work actively works against that goal.
