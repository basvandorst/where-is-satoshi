I feel what you are saying. The ideal society in my mind is one where there is no law, no central power and people are their own master, and people are super excellent. Bakunin and stuff, a *contrat social* with myself. The thing is, how the fuck do we get there? We kill the state and then what?
My opinion is that it is far more plausible and constructive to work on profoundly restructuring how our societies works. I believe in reversing centralization of powers and bringing them as close as possible to the individuals, thrashing constitutions, dismantling wall street, splitting countries in smaller entities, reforming money systems, sacking the police and the army and some more. But to get there.. society will have to make a bunch of drastic moves to the left. We need to put serious barriers on the capacity of some to own other people's time, money and homes. And what grants some this capacity to own others? It's power and coercion first. If people organize and fight hard, they can take control, change the state and use it to get that power back, it seems like the best ticket and it wont be done by individuals alone. Democracy as we know it has to be forked.

I have a iphone 4, when it dies I won't get a new one. This just adds to the list of things I hate about apple. I have a G5 collecting dust in the corner too, the last mac I will have bought.
The number one reason I hate them is because that if they would not have got OSX out, Linux would now be  well developed and the pro's choice.

I had to google the guy. Don't know what to think after cross reading the wikipedia page about him, he shoots in many directions.
Anyways, I think we should stop using the right and the left to describe political inclinations. It's too vague and context sensitive to be useful.

If at some point there was a way to download unlimited money on the pirate bay and ruin the concept of money altogether, that would be great too. 
I always had this fantasy of a universal currency that you could mine working or doing something productive. There would be a fair for everybody formula (amount of work X difficulty X specification X need/demand X risk... etc). The money would lose value with time so it couldn't accumulate that much over generations and inflation coming from new moneys could be controlled. Private property would be abolished for a leasing system. Of course there would be a few technicalities to solve.. Like who would issue and enfoce the coinz? Circles of elders? Soviets? Democratic units? Amazon EC10?  it's a work in progress... but it should be the next step after Bitcoin or the one after that.
That being said I hate the banks as much as anybody, but I fear that if bitcoin succeeds, wallstreet and such would be pretty quick at controlling it and all that would remain of the ideals would be less transaction fees and a bunch of earlier adopter néo riches. Just look at how everybody is super happy that big players might start to put money in bitcoin this year...to the moon. All I can say is if some of you guys get rich with bitcoins, stay with the community and invest your capital in development, just don't cash out and buy a stupid car or a mansion.
Also if you really want to hurt "the banks", join a credit union... credit, that's where they get you.

Haven't bought any bitcoin since I have lost the meager 0.222btc I moved there not knowing I would need to verify my account to move the coins out. I did enjoy receiving postcards in Japanese in my regular mail from the forfeiture people. :(

Doesn't solve anything, but there definitely should be a one stop **reputation checker** for the crypto world services. Going around and synthesize your opinion by  gathering scattered and more or less reliable information on forums is not how it should be.
A nice little grid. What is it, how it works? who is behind it? since when? Physical address? Up to date info, Reviews, history, risk factor, security weaknesses, a big red warning when a scam have been identified. All this supported by the community maybe through a forumish discussion on each service, maybe a wiki?
Also, I think that anonymity for individuals can be good, but for most service providers it is not as acceptable.

It's already fairly easy compared to say paypal, so I'm pretty confident on that aspect. The only complicated part right now is acquiring and sell the coin, but it soon will be a problem of the past.
