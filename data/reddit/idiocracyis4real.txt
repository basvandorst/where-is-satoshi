No genesis block
Using Bitcoin in the name
A Bitcoin whale along with a developer and miner fork off Bitcoin using an emotional issue. Those Bitcoin dividends (bCash) are slowly sold to the naive.
It’s the perfect scam.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:33:28
Do you mean running the bCash scam?
BCash only needs one exchange for whales to dump their bCash on the naive.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:09:35
Um no. Nobody uses bCash. It’s an exit scam by whales...they love Bitcoin dividends while holding their Bitcoin. Perfect scam.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:49:00
Did the price of 6k reflect the utility?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:50:21
Going down the rabbit hole of “what is money” was a crazy adventure for me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:38:38
You are being exit scammed by whales.
If you really believed in your project you would start with a genesis block with a name not containing Bitcoin.....but this is not about the project. A few people with large sums of Bitcoin fork, take the bCash dividends, then slowly sell them off to the naive.
There is no way they could run this scam without forking 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:33
Or like BCash where holders immediately get the alt coin and all they need to do is market a little and slowly exit their position.
If I were a whale I would be pro-forks...bring on bCash, bGold, b2x
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:51:05
No, Roger is a wanker.

@_date: 2017-12-16 13:46:41
Ask the prostitutes, gamblers and drug dealers if they use it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:40:37
Yep. I use Breadwallet, so not sure about the fees. I didn’t have any issue on Newegg.
Trust me, bCash is a scam. You just need a developer, a minor, some nodes, at least one exchange and some marketing. Fork Bitcoin and then slowly sell off your bCash as you burn through your marketing. The one miner can mine and if another miner is stupid enough to mine then all the better. There will be zero advancements. If I was a whale this would be my scam.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:38:19
It is marketing to add Bitcoin in bCash’s name. They needed that in order to somehow stay relevant long enough for huge coin holders to slowly dump into the market. It is just like BGold, a get rich quick scheme. These are scams.

@_date: 2017-12-02 15:20:14
Yep, they forked to make money with the Bitcoin name. It is an exit scam.

@_date: 2017-12-15 22:52:23
Your life must be really sad :(
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:36:34
It was a fork without a genesis block which means it didn’t grow organically. Everyone with Bitcoin got bCash, so they have users. Add Bitcoin to the name and some Newbies are scammed into thinking it was Bitcoin. It is a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:45:28

Go use your bCash and leave

Get your own sub. This is Bitcoin. Take your bCash scam somewhere else
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:43:19
Go run your bCash scam on your own sub
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:33:13
I am not defensive. You have found plenty of your own reasons to not use it. There is no sense for you posting.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:16:22
I have had zero issues getting out of bCash on Kraken. Coinbase, on the other hand, owes me bCash

He doesn’t promote centralized Coins
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:03:24
I emailed them to not support 2x....they still moved forward. They appear to be finally allowing access to bCash but allowing bCash trading. I use Kraken instead 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:46:32
That was a good one

But technology brings everyone one up. You can’t say people’s lives would not have improved under a stable currency.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:11:07
Nobody would use bCash (BCH) for transactions, because that would be dangerous

@_date: 2017-12-02 23:18:34
Nope. In Bitcoin, nodes keep the miners in check. In ETH, Vitalik is in control. If he is losing money he will fork. ETH is not immutable 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:47:04
I am surprised how they didn’t weave Trump into the story :)

@_date: 2017-12-10 03:10:42
Whales need their Bitcoin dividends. If anyone hasn’t come to the conclusion that bCash is a scam, then Barnum was right.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:49:45
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:54:34
Yeah, when the bCashers come a trolling it is sad to see.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:32:30
Stay safe...those bCash scammers want your money
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:49:08
Not at all, but I can see why bCash is the perfect scam and why 2x was called off for now.  If I owned a lot of Bitcoin this would be the perfect way to get paid from Newbs and naive.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:41:17
You weren’t paying attention 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:59:52
Not at all. BCashers should get their own sub for pumping 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:51:27
Nope. The current system 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:30:42
And Roger 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:29:41
Centralization 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:13:30
No it’s a whale exit scam
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:40:08
Don’t use it or hold it then. Continue with fiat. 
Thanks and see you later
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:13:33
That’s no moon
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:44:06
If Roger has a big supply of Bitcoin then his bCash dividend is just as big. There is every reason for him to pimp BCash to collect his dividend 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:10:12
And your point is?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:49:11

Ahh you are a gambler 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:44:26
Stay away from bCash. It’s a scam 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:35:50
Whales brought you bCash. They have been slowly exiting out of their scam
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:08
See ya
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:51:21
No thanks. Just take your scam elsewhere 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:27:33
Mess? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:35:08
Because whales needed money. They get a miner(s) and a developer together to fork off Bitcoin using the Bitcoin name. Then the whales sell off their bCash to Newbs who fall for the emotional issue of block size. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:17:53
Big blocks require fork after fork after fork. Soon very few nodes are available which is critical to decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:13:21
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:27:03
Yep, that is why I spelled it that way ;)
That BTC sub is a cesspool
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:25:56
I am calling BS
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:03:28
As fungible as bCash
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:40:03
And forking when founders are about to lose money. ETH is a centralized coin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:19:05
It’s all deception. It is a centralized scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:35:10

@_date: 2017-12-01 03:48:22
Nope. Run your bCash scam in your own sub
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:21:45
It would never be immutable like Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:31:17
BCash is a scam. ETH is not immutable and it’s centralized. My bet would be on Bitcoin and Monero
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:47:48
I am not following 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:05:18
Ahh a bCash pumper is in the House
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:26:48
Look up old shows of a Podcast called Bitcoin Uncensored. Very interesting and fun.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:34:39
Yep the Big Short did not, in my opinion, lay the largest amount of blame to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Rating Agencies. Fannie was buying so many loans outside their limits that they were making inroads into subprime. Also, what the rating agencies did was downright criminal.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:15:28
Remember Newbies, R/BTC is a cesspool of BCash /Bitcoin Cash supporters. Don’t be confused. It is alt coin scam.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:33:43
I thought he sold his position for bCash
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:17:55
BCash is an exit scam
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:28:57
Thanks for the laugh
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:50:25
Go ahead and attack it :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:25:03
Nope. It has warmed a little. Bitcoin has zero impact. Go put your tinfoil hat on.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:32:37
I think that is kinda simplistic and unprovable. Think of all the technology invented with a gold back currency. Electricity? Cars?????
Were these not advancements?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:55:51
All money is faith
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:00:15

Nope. The climate is constantly in a state of change. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:31:58
Any else is bCash
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:01:42
If you were PR wouldn’t you have spent more on infrastructure then to protect your investment?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:20:56
They are bCash pumpers
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:26:38
Give it Time. With enough government grants you can get any kind of apocalypse now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:25:21
Works fine where I live
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:37
They didn’t create a genesis block and use Bitcoin in the name. Completely dishonest 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:23:23
Agreed. The Bernanke, the smartest guy at the Fed, couldn’t identify a housing bubble. He kept lower rates and pumping.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:10:02
But wouldn’t their costs get lower?
I agree rapid price swings either way would make it hard to run a business, but to categorically say a Little inflation is good because people will invest and innovate, but a little deflation is bad because they won’t invest and innovate...I am not on board with that thinking and history has shown otherwise.
I am not naive with the current rate of progress and I truly believe we have never had it better on planet earth, but I think a stable currency (non inflationary) could get us there too. We just have lived so long with fiat we don’t know any other way.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:01:53
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:26:30
Do you have an example of a blockchain that doesn’t have a currency tied to it?
If you link anything from IBM I know you have no idea because they certainly don’t.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:28:56
What is that stopping you from investing?
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:31:37
Go ahead and sell. See yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:46:15
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Satoshi my Bitcoin to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Satoshi my Bitcoin to take. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:22:28
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:24:04
They forked so dumb people buy their bCash dividends. It is the perfect scam.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:39:26
I am not closed minded about Monero and Bitcoin. The rest of them are centralized, so not interested. BCash is a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:43:57
Because it is a scam
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:11:54
BCash pumper ^
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:02:04
Yep they put a lot of eggs into 2x and now accepting bCash
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:20:05
Don’t use it then. Patience 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:32:54
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:14:14
Is that right. Get a new sub to spread your scam FUD
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:52:11
Then go to that sub to pump
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:06:05
That is the bCash pump meme
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:03:32
Why sell? Try to use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:44:09
Didn’t he have insurance or is that not available there?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:24:03
BCash scammer here ^
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:18:37
Yes it does. Centralized scam
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:28:20
Nonsense, I just bought a graphics card.
bCash is an exit scam coin from certain whales. It was a perfect way for them to make money off the naive.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:19:48
For me it is negligible 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:44:04
They are money scams
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:19:43
R/BTC is where the bCash / Bitcoin Cash scam is run.
The scam:
Get newbies emotionally invested in a “solution “ so they invest their real fiat into. Whales can slowly dump their bCash for free money (dividends). It is a beautiful scam.
You need:
- a willing miner
- a willing exchange 
- a willing developer
- a few nodes 
- marketing budget
- an emotional issue
This is very easy to do when you own a large quantity of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:16:03
See ya
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:53:09
He is a scammer and is unloading his bCash dividends. I am willing to bet he has all his Bitcoin and will be involved with some other fork in the future . Forks are money makers
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:38:20
Triggered 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:25:52
No kidding, I had thought all this CO2 in the air was causing more hurricanes and making them stronger. I was wrong. It is good to be skeptical, because the media loves ratings not evidence.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:23:31
Yes, but watch a few of his podcasts. This dude knows his stuff. He called bCash a scam a while ago
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:36:59
Why do you care?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:10:04
They are scam you when they get rid of their free coins
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:02:13
Cartman seems more like a bCash kid
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:03:53
It puts the money with the kids. Parents get choose. Why are you against choice?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:19:56
He is a tool
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:48:34
I think most people knew something was and is wrong when they couldn’t even prosecute Hillary. I am still shocked Obama didn’t fire her, but some people get special privileges :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:37:29
It’s marketing. They are using Oracle and calling it a blockchain 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:11:54
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:27:00
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:58:30
That sub is a cesspool. It should be renamed BCash

Don’t you see changing the block size as a never ending solution? 2 becomes 4 becomes 8?
Regardless, transactions still take roughly 10 minutes to settle. This is why I am more of a scaling via a 2nd layer.

@_date: 2017-12-14 21:53:41
My guess is we will see a 4th tab for bCash rather than the ability to move it to another exchange to sell  it and get out of the scam. 
If this the scenario, then I am pretty sure Coinbase was in on the scam to prevent mass sell off. Kraken was ready to accept bCash pretty quickly....I wonder why Coinbase dragged their feet ;)

@_date: 2017-02-24 10:40:32
I think some people feel that way, but I like to see how information is presented and ask questions. I always think of "news" as what are they selling and how are they selling it. Graphs are always fun on TV, because they catch the eye.
@_date: 2017-02-06 11:28:02
Do you even trust that website?
As a former accountant, I remain skeptical at any of these numbers. Hell, people trusted Enrons books and they were publicly audited. 
Maybe I am too skeptical.
@_date: 2017-02-04 04:37:13
Agreed. Last year during the riots in Milwaukee a gal was on TV speaking to the crowd:
I am paraphrasing, but is was something like "You need to stop this violence and looting"

@_date: 2017-02-04 21:47:45
Dude you have to be careful with all news. Remember last year during the Milwaukee riots?

According to this  Googles 2016 ad revenue was almost $80m. 
The poster said that if Google went down for a few minutes that they would lose millions. So I didn't agree with this number because if his number is correct and it is a $1million a minute then Googles ad revenue would be crazy. There are 525,600 minutes a year.

Because we don't need to. Segwit gets us an increase. Now 2nd layer solutions get us to many more transactions...which are not needed now.

Agreed, a fork scares me.

Bernanke was an "expert" and he kept cutting rates. Who would have known he was a bubble maker.
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:13:40
Not any
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:53:15
No kidding, now we hook everything up to a blockchain and run it on ETH
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:17:12
He certainly has. I want to see what happens. 
The left said very little when Obama patronized the Middle East on one hand and then with the other sent in drones to kill innocent people. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 02:10:23
@_date: 2017-01-28 15:01:18
Why not increase it to 10mb...to be safe?
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:56:49
Ah thanks, so how are they different than a bank?
I just heard that they bank through Wells.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:38:08
Sounds legit
@_date: 2017-01-26 11:51:26
Eventually your anger will subside....now you can grab the tin foil hat from the Obama haters :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:10:09
Agree. I like the idea of free money. Today, I am going to sign up on one of the exchanges that have bCash. Hopefully, I can move some of my BCash there are sell it. I am hopeful.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:08:18
Do you trust them to fork your ETH the way you want ?
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:17:22
Me neither but a hard fork seems dangerous 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:54:37
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:16:43
What parts?
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:17:50
Well they do have a hard time reading bills :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:59:40
I am dumping BCC when Breadwallet gives me the chance
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:13:16
How about BCash instead?
@_date: 2017-01-19 09:24:41
Indeed. I use Coinbase and have not had any problems, but I am small time.
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:28:48
Why does it need to take on fiat?
Does it need to take on Visa?

I don't deny science. I love how the scientific method slaps these warmest down.
Now I need one article that shows all of the people's names...not your "read this article" for some names and "read another"
One list of all names. I see what you are doing :)
By the way stay away from Skeptical Science...it is neither skeptical or science. It's like Fox, CNN....
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:49:10
It is a horrible process...I gave up. I still use Breadwallet though. The design is beautiful.

Don't the miners have to be careful?
If they don't promote value, then won't customers use something else?
With banking, I get paid in us $ and it gets direct deposited....I don't have much choice other than to move to another bank in the system.
@_date: 2017-01-18 11:53:34
How are they differentiating themselves for the consumer market?
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:34:01
Agree, but with Bitcoin I own my own 1s and 0s. I don't have to lug around my gold or hope that someone honors my paper gold iou :)
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:30:46
Agreed. I was giving you options along with the fix you seek still doesn't matter if the miner is allowed to exclude your transaction :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:30:34
@_date: 2017-01-19 03:10:25
Is this volume on chain?
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:57:37
ETH isn't immutable...troubled times ahead for this centralized coin.
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:22:19
It is not settled at all. I suppose you are going to throw out that ridiculous 97% of scientists believe garbage. Show me all 100% of the names.
We have basically been in a pause as far as surface temps go for quite some time. Some scientists believe the heat goes in the ocean and I am willing to listen, but the arrogance of the settled science is condescending to everyone. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 19:45:16
So Trump would do the same as Obama...the rich get richer?
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:25:33
Thanks George. I don't really know what is meant by blockchain tech?
1. Is yours consensus based?
2. Decentralized?
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:55:38
Did you just assume identity :)
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:52:56
He "said" he didn't. I am going to have to see his addresses to know he isn't lying.

Thank. I will check them out. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:01:12
Why waste time when there is no value in bCash?
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:11:44
ethereum Classic is just Val forking it off to save himself and the other founders money. Val could care less.
BCash is ketchy. I just want to sell mine, but need help finding an exchange 
@_date: 2017-01-18 12:03:38
Source 
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:09:02
BCash will eventually higher fees.
But what are you going to do with your coffee transaction when the miner mines an empty block?
Wait in the store?
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:58:39
Would you buy my bCash mate?
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:37:22
PayPal is a bank. In order for it to be a bank it has to belong to a member bank of the Federal Reserve which in this case, I believe, is Wells Fargo.
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:21:03
The earth has been warming long before Bitcoin and long before CO2. It is interesting how the temp has now paused...is that Bitcoins fault? I think it's ETH :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:52:45
Or bCash. It is the same thing in my eyes. Of course my eyes hurt from trying to see the eclipse 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:09:02

They don't need your taxes to do shit. Taxes just keep you in line and angry :)
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:11:32
We are fine. The  use case for Bitcoin which is a store of value is secure. The future is the 2nd layer.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:54:04
Yep, must think like them :)
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:23:43
So who are the 3%?
Why are you so angry and emotional? A simple statistic like 97% should be comprised of a total data set. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:03:34
Names please. All of them. Show your work.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:08:31
Agreed, but there are a lot of forces at work to confuse the market :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:25:52
BCash = free money
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:54:02
Show me one model in the history of these global warming models that is accurate in predicting temperatures. If we know exactly how and why the earth has warmed wouldn't we have one accurate model? At least one.
Bill Nye is a tool.

So how do you know he owns a lot?
@_date: 2017-01-20 23:43:14
Brought us back or do you think it was a giant porkfest?
My guess is the people that wanted something saw blood in the water :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:16:25
But then we get back to 2, 5, 128mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:24:13
Left and right are evil...I equally hate them.
The ACA was shitty a bill. Insurance companies hood winked us. We could have moved more people to Medicaid far far cheaper and we still don't have a solution for pre-existing conditions....which was the crux of the problem :(
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:25:15
Now try moving money in your bank to another bank in the world.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:34:11
What do we do when miners mine empty blocks? They didn't care at all about collecting fees
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:06:06
Good lord you got pummeled by the Twins

If it is in a mutual fund. The point is value.
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:17:53
I think the Big Short was fine, but they really missed the true source of the meltdown which was the Fed mismanagement of interest rates. Rates needed to continually go down for more people to "trade up" into the ever increasing home prices. But that is a tough story to tell.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:10:32
Butt hurt
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:44:22
Not when we get to 128mb blocks ;)
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:05:55
Looks like him
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:26:37
Don't you think value is derived from Faith? 
The reason the US dollar is strong relative to most foreign currencies can't be supply and demand could it?
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:56:59
I can't wait for them to create 16mb blocks for double the power.
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:25:40
Or BCH
@_date: 2017-01-28 10:59:20
Wasn't the peso already hurt by the strong US dollar?

Would you buy my BCH? I want to dump so badly. The price will only go down.
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:19:20
They are still getting a donation. Even if the fee was 90% they would make 10. There may be a different reason for removing a link.
Do you have an example?
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:38:33
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:49:04
But had he not been cutting rates we would not have "needed" him to save us from anything. The Fed caused 2008 which in my mind proves they are not independent.
@_date: 2017-01-19 12:02:49
What do you mean on this one?
@_date: 2017-01-28 10:56:53
Calm down it's just saber rattling.
Gorbachev was a bafoon 
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:15:09
Then use BCash, miners, litecoin.... or
Set your transaction fee as low as you want and take a chance.
Regardless, if the block was 128mb the miner still can decide not to include your transaction. They mine empty blocks don't they?
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:05:45
We have bCash, so I am not sure either.
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:48:57
I find this hard to believe 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:03:56
Interesting thought. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:36:56
Triggered indeed. 
Own it
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:03:14
Nope, Breadwallet gives you a one time ability to move your bCash
I have not moved mine yet. I was going to open a Kraken account, but they were offline when I tried.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:48:45
Why do you hate children :)
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:40:40
Yep, it like those people that think Russia stole the election too...they can't admit the Hillary was a crab person.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:59:16
Agreed. If I move BCH to you, but don't have a place to post the price in Fiat then how would anyone be able to discern a price?
For all we know these mined BCH blocks could contain similar transactions to those micro fee transactions that built up in the mempool that people cried about.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:55:40
Will you buy my BCH :)
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:19:11
We agree to disagree. There is no losing when Bitcoin is decentralized.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:01:50
Are you dumping BCC?
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:33:37
Do you know the addresses he owns?
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:41:56
That is not true. We are now learning that organisms will and are eating plastic in the ocean. I don't like the idea of dumping, but it doesn't last forever.
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:06:19
How do we really know the volume of Bitcoin transactions on an exchange? Are they audited by a 3rd party?
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:04:07
What is a white person :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:03:45
BCash it is. I just want to get rid of it, but Coinbase is making me wait until it is worthless :(
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:36:04
Do you know the addresses he owns?
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:29:51
Thanks. I will look.

No immutably...Vit will fork you.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:36:38
Yeah the Dems really tried to screw over Bernie and the public. Now they want us all to think it's the Russians....I have a bridge for sale in Brooklyn

Bad money is a big problem. Bitcoin is better money because you only need faith in math not corruption 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:01:39
My lasting CNN moment was last year during the riot in Milwaukee after a police shooting. CNN aired this woman, I think related to the victim, admonishing the crowd to stop the violence . CNN never played the part where she went on to say, I am paraphrasing, to go into white neighborhoods and wreck their shit.

Do you have a plan for how you move out of being broke?
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:17:23
Did you move any BCash? What was the price?
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:52:24
128mb blocks solve the problem:)
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:05:46
Maybe there is fine print and he had the clairvoyance to see the fork? He is donating his BCC :)
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:16:23
At work mgmt always wants more features jammed into the release :)
Fortunately for Bitcoin slow and steady will win this race
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:16:20
Don't be so mad.
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:05:05
Tell that to Venezuelans 
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:33:35
In my experience, solving a problem that is not a problem ends up wasting time and money.
If governments legal drugs and gambling what does that do to Bitcoin's user base? All these what if scenarios are just that...what ifs. I understand what you think may happen, but I believe a prudent move would be to get lighting working and some adoption.
My 2 cents.
@_date: 2017-01-18 03:17:34
Very interesting! I am not a gambler, but holy shit .

All kinds of scientist publishing on why theses models are wrong. We know it had warmed and now has paused. My favorite is how models now predict 50 years in the future...after the modeler...is dead. These modelers are getting tired of being wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:17:05
2mb is stupid, we need to move right now to 128...that is clearly the most responsible number.
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:50:56
That is an interesting question, because I would think he would have to put this as a long term asset on his/hers books just like a stock and record the value of the coin in his/hers countries currency as the base price at the time of purchase.
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:12:33
Isn't it eating into it already?
It sounds like Segwit is the path to a more robust payment network. What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:32:10
Please post the transaction 
@_date: 2017-01-30 02:31:54
Flicker is angry 
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:32:41
Likely not. Why doesn't r/BTC change their name to r/bCash?
They have everything they want. No Segwit and the ability to scale to 128mb blocks for all the coffee transactions on chain.
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:49:44

Damn autocorrect 
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:34:39
Grandstanding 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:46:41
Yeah I would need to see proof. Regardless, Bitcoin will never be Visa on the main chain not even close. The Ver FUD about buying coffee on chain is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:06:54
Names please. Otherwise, the number can easily be made up and spread by internet FUD.
Show your work. Remember that phrase? You will have to look a LONG time, but you won't find names. Why do you think that is? Give it some thought as you look for the data of all the names that make up 100%.
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:53:06
So is bCash BCH or BCC?
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:37:43
Yep. People will use the money when they have to as opposed to inflationary money which if not spent goes down in value :)
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:21:29

Don't listen then....I love freedom

I just want my free money. I want out of BCC.

But we needs 128mb blocks so all transactions can fit...including my coffee :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:06:51
That is why they have bCash. BCash was everything the r/BTC crowd wants...they cant stop though.

No kidding. You should see people get butt hurt when I suggest global warming may be mostly natural...people go ape
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:24:08
I apologize but what does that mean?
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:01:34
Is that through a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:55:45
But maybe Coinbase sets a market price so low and with their fees they don't get any sellers. I mean who wants bCash?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:53:25
They can't stop...they don't understand.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:12:16
I am not sure about that...I have to do more reading. But honestly, we have so many climate models and every one of them is wrong...settled science indeed.

Bitcoin is programmable money.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:11:04
You are running a scam
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:55:16
You used the word competing elites...Bitcoin was born through good intentions and hard work. BCash just forked off with no genesis Block...no hard work. One is clearly a get rich scam. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the difference.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:40:54
It is probably a bCash pumper
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:15:14
If you leave and get a new sub for your bCash pumping ...sure
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:24:25
Nah...Zimbabwe will be just fine
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:18:11
Thanks. These bCash pumpers are thick  with their scam
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:20:18
Go away and scam somewhere else
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:32:08
BCash pumping at its finest
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:04:04
Facebook is a tool, just like Twitter, Google, CNN, ABC....you are constantly being marketed. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:30:09
Patience. Bitcoin has had to deal with a lot of attacks which slows progress greatly.
I just want the bCash pumpers to get their own sub to run their exit scam.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:16:23
Yep. BCash spammers are in full force
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:53:55
BCash holder right there...sneaky
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:24:57
Get out then since you know so much about economics and finance.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:36:30
Not a chance. Governments need to inflate their currency. How do you think they can afford all those new weapons?
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:27:33
I agree. Is this illegal?
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:52:18
I use to say that at $750, $1,000, $1,100.....
I can’t tell you what is speculation vs use, but my son just bought his graphics card with Bitcoin

Isn’t the Block increase from Segwit?
I remember Jihan not wanting any part of Segwit 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:01:34
That is a lifetime on Reddit

Remember Bitcoin at $.50? It went all the way up and CRASHED TO $2
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:35:33
BCash is a scam coin created by disingenuous freeloaders. They did not grow organically with a genesis Block and they put “Bitcoin “ in their coin name...that tells you enough right there.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:50:21
I bought $25 a month for 5 straight months when it was 1700.
Past performance doesn’t guarantee future results 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:50:00
No. It is hard to really trust any numbers from exchanges. Most of their volume could be off chain. Nobody knows without their addresses. 
bCash volume...miners could be moving it between each other.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:36:07
How do you get banned from here?
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:39:03
Very interesting future ahead of us indeed. 
Candidates: we love Bitcoin 
Public Officials: we need to figure out how to stop Bitcoin while showing everyone we love Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:51:25
Forking off with no genesis block and using Bitcoin in the name. That is a scam. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:21:10
And Bitcoin allows you to send a payment without permission. The rule is that it takes roughly 10 minutes to guarantee in the Blockchain.
Visa is instantaneous. Merchants accept the risk.
Completely different use case of which Bitcoin doesn’t have a chance.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:47:58
Go use bCash then and get off this Bitcoin sub to run your scam.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:08:27
It is centralized and inflating why is that a good investment?
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:30:40
Whatever. You can move to a scam coin.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:07:02
Bingo. Jihan never wanted Segwit either. It had to be forced upon him
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:33:07
Good luck 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:38:53
Indeed as the poster lurks
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:09:31
How could you use both subs and not go nuts on r/BTC with all the Core is evil posts?
That sub is all bCash, but masquerading with the BTC symbol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:10:18
See you bye
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:15:24
Bitcoin doesn’t care
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:11:57
You are holding a centralized and inflating currency....good luck
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:14:56
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:49:28
It’s a scam and they are deceiving. I will not rest until that scam is put to rest like one coin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:14:03
BCash pumper here ^
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:49:43
I just moved bCash yesterday to the exchange to sell it. It took 40 minutes...bCash certainly wasn’t faster for a centralized coin.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:15:00
Do you think bCash will go up?
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:18:03
They are trying to get transactions, because they started out as a scam fork.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:44:38
It does
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:35:30
You are a bCash scammers 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:53:01
You don’t, but if you are apathetic then why post at all?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:13:18
Then don’t. You are free to choose. I choose math
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:29:47
Ha...for all we know he may may moderate BTC....that sub is bCash pump paradise 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:37:32
You are not bright. Now get off this sub and get your own sub to pump your scam.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:23:41
Yes I want my free money and yes bCash is a scam. Yes
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:50:26
Balls of steel

I gave you +1, but I think many people truly don’t understand the power of immutable, decentralized global money.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:23:50
Yep it’s a scam coin
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:32:56
Nope. The poster is shilling for bCash. I don’t need an echo chamber to identify scammers.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:02:46
Don’t worry, for little items just accept on received. These other clowns want to scare you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:26:51
And tries to bark about how many millions it has
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:30:44
Or you bCash scammers sell your Bitcoin, get off Bitcoin subs and get your own sub to pump your alt coin?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:00:09
But bCash is a scam
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:25:39
Yes, unfortunately Jihan and Roger will take all their profits from &gt;$1K per bCash and buy just enough to create a floor somewhere down by $200. Roger will start pumping again. Rinse and repeat until he is out of bCash
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:38:24
The trick is to avoid scams like bCash :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:04:23
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:54:42
BCash is get rich quick scam. I was thankful for the free money....but the concept is hilarious 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:09:34
The future will certainly be interesting. What do you think will happen?
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:49:31
I am making no bets on it. I just buy and use Bitcoin.

Not trolling at all this is Bitcoin. BCash scammers need there own sub. Right?
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:01:32
Agree to a point, but what 2008 taught many was that your debt is relatively fixed and assets can fluctuate greatly. When asset prices plunge quickly best laid plans go to shit quick.
It taught me to avoid debt as much as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:46:55
I have been asking for this...they are deceiving people :(
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:00:29
So these are Coinbase’s numbers. Unverifiable!
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:57:22
I am not following you. At least with Bitcoin, the supply is fixed with math. A government crypto supply is not fixed by math because it is centralized. Government already has digital money. What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:40:19

@_date: 2017-11-15 14:28:12
Nonsense, you can get very good information in this sub,  interesting how you choose to vent and comment rather than move on :)

@_date: 2017-11-29 05:30:17
See ya
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:31:26
You don’t. Get your own sub to promote bCash.

@_date: 2017-11-17 03:52:54
Holy Hanna was there a lot of spam posts about fees, Core and blocksize. R/BTC was ablaze in anger.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:23:38
Maybe they could write how bCash was a fork of dishonesty and deceit. If bCash were honest they would have started with a genesis block and tried to grow organically. Instead, they went the scamming route.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:04:03
BCash is a scam. A forked Coin with value...lol

@_date: 2017-11-13 00:33:56
Bitcoin is always under attacked It’s decentralized and immutable. If that is not enough for you go try bCash, Ether or Fiat. If you are still not sure, then I am sorry but Bitcoin is not for you.

@_date: 2017-11-30 13:09:17
Exactly, that is why I don’t support Coinbase. They were part of 2x and I am willing to bet they are part of bCash. They will not let people exit out of the bCash scam. Including me. I want my free money. See how easy it is to pull off a scam when you fork?

@_date: 2017-11-22 01:39:55
Yeah bCash wouldn’t seem so scammy if they would have grown organically with a genesis Block instead of forking off and using the word Bitcoin in the name....that screams scammy.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:03:58
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:36:54

@_date: 2017-11-12 14:10:03
I would like to know when Breadwallet will support SegWit
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:38:13
Then why are you here? Why are you posting?
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:55:48
How do you know whether or not Google is in on it?
Google can do anything 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:23:45
Doesn’t a pyramid scheme involve some orchestration with someone at the top?
Who is at the top?
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:01:25
Than I don’t really see value, but Vitalic sure must have thought so when he forked it to save his wealth.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:06:29
Is there a good summary of tether that you could link?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:51:37
All I can think of is he has one foot on the brake and one the gas
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:51:28
Don’t respond then
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:20:41
It may happen. Need the right use case. The only one I see now is multi signatures which is already being done.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:56:04
ETH is centralized and not immutable...I would not trust it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:22:43
Nope. Not at all. It’s a scam
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:14:01
I am angry with Bread. No Segwit support nor do they let you change your fee. I am considering switching. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:00:13
BCH is scam coin
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:09:13
Lots of spam transactions again?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:49:45
BCash pumper here ^
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:35:03
Bingo 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:06:13
Go away and scam somewhere else
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:37:08
Yeah I thought it was weird how Eric’s company had no Segwit addresses maybe I am wrong. He can either cry like a bitch or join bCash shilling or both.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:18:03
All the more reason to switch to Segwit 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:38:12
BCash is a scam. Our job is to let newbies know about scams. BCash has lots of marketers.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:48:57
Identify your audience and give them the “news” they want so they come back and advertisers are happy.
CNN, CBS, ABC, FOX....do it all the time
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:03:11
Hillary did that?
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:42:18
Then stop using and go away
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:02:38
Don’t worry. Nobody uses bCash.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:09:58
A buddy at work keeps bees and gives away the honey. In 2015, I told him I would give him $8 worth of Bitcoin for it. He said sure and downloaded a wallet. I told him to write down the recovery phrase many times and store it in different places. We went out to lunch and he paid the tab in fiat and I paid him $10 worth of Bitcoin for my share.
3 weeks ago I asked if he still had his Bitcoin wallet....”Nope, I can’t find the phrase and I sold the phone”
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:00:37
I read a post that empty blocks mostly occur when a miner wins 2 blocks in a row. The 1st contains all the transactions and when the solve the 2nd block they get lucky. Is that true?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:29:48
Roger is a wanker
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:48:10
Go get your own sub to run your bCash scam
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:46:18
Can you get that much energy from one solar panel?
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:40:37
Why did he create a genesis Block?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:10:47
Yeah and bCash shills :(
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:57:15
Indeed. They can threaten all they want, but Bitcoin doesn’t care.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:55:08
Take your bCash scam and find a new sub
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:01:30
Go ahead and pick up ETH anytime...they will make more and fork when Val feels he is losing money :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:49:40
If I was an online merchant I would accept Bitcoin. In store I would say it depends on the transaction speed, but for the most part no.
Proof of work takes time...that is the beauty of Bitcoin’s security. Alt Coins like bCash can reduce transaction time, because they are worth less and don’t need security.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:50:23
I look at intent. Satoshi had passion and started with nothing. If bCash would have copied the code and started with a genesis block and grew organically I would have some respect...but it is money scheme with pumpers everywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:34:34
Your username is damn funny
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:11:56
Why is it not accessible?
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:19:53
Fool, I will be HODLn :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:12:57
Why not 128mb?
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:39:00
And....then you fork so certain people won’t lose money :)
ETH is not decentralized at all.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:52:53
Please list the ETH contracts sparky
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:30:03
Or he wouldn’t have had to fork off the DAO fiasco
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:26:28
To me this is maturation. Promise to pay at a future date has always been part of an economy and now Bitcoin is a part of it. 
Bitcoin may be peer to peer, immutable and decentralized, but that is not going to stop someone from betting.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:22:43
Good one snowball...you are just like Roger
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:40:55
Bitcoin is constantly under attack. I will fight FUD every chance I get. It helps the Newbs.
Roger and the bCash crew should be ashamed for the scam they continue to pull.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:07:35
Bitcoin.com is as good as fake news.
Newbies be careful go there
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:57:58
Was that the crash to $35 :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:21:36
He is fine for a centralized coin
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:08:16
BCash should be honest and this is the biggest problem people have with these get rich quick schemes 
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:00:06
Why would merchant adoption ever happen? 
Visa has cornered that market. What is Visa doing wrong that would make consumers and merchants switch?
If that is BCHs use case, then it is dead.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:08:17
Not damaging to Bitcoin at all.
BCash is a scam without a Genesis Block and they took the name to obfuscate new users. Their CEO is a wanker and they have no development team.
It is a clown show.
That is how I feel about bCash :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:57:16
It’s all about honest intentions.
BCash has none.
ETH forks when founders are about to lose money
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:47:35
What color is the sky in your world?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:31:01
Get a new sub and go away with your potty mouth
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:59:34
It’s not dying. Its frustration from attack after attack. BCash was just the latest with tons of Reddit shitposts.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:54:53
Don’t be lazy. Bitcoin isn’t for you then.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:48:18
Yep waiting for Segwit and fee adjustment 
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:13:59
You have to ask the druggies, prostitutes and gamblers.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:58:36
I have a Redditor crush on your comments ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:09:52
Search R/Bitcoin, people have written numerous threads on the deception.
BCash really needs a new name. It’s terribly misleading, but most likely it was named that way to confuse people. I guess if I was running a scam I would market the same way.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:58:02
And Reddit allows it :(
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:33:58
Better call the Bitcoin CEO on the carpet.
Congress: I need answers!
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:03:50
Words mean things. Choose a new name for bCash
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:47:11
BCash is a scam
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:56:51
Are those numbers audited by a 3rd party?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:49:45
Go ahead and create a bCash sub to run your scam. This is Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:49:02
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:34:21
Scams can last a long time. Just helping the Newbs understand how scammy bCash is
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:47:35
How do we know there are 13m users?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:27:56
BCash is a Ver scam
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:01:48
You really got him with “just believe.”
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:23:57
There were no ATH is 2014,2015 or 2016
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:53:41
Roger wanted bCash to run his scam
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:45:05
Can you explain more?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:23:48
How do you know that?
Was it the same people that caused the recession....the FED?
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:22:18
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:52:43
Did the same and sold a Maple Leaf. Great decision so far.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:01:51
Go away. Find your own sub to pump bCash
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:28:33
Nonsense. That bill was written by insurance companies.
We could have figured out pre-existing conditions for far less. My premiums go up at least 15% along with the deductible....Dems got bamboozled
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:44:12
How are they making money?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:30:27
That is fine. Bitcoin is not a scam coin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:41:58
I just took my bCash out of TREZOR to Kraken and sold it for fiat. Contrary to the FUD, bCash from Trezor to Kraken took over 40min.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:03:00
A transaction has never gotten stuck for me. If that happens you probably went really low :)
They get cleared out eventually

@_date: 2017-11-16 07:57:59
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:36:48
Maybe the growth came from technology advancement. It seems spurious to show cause and effect. I still don’t understand why falling prices are bad. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:50:12
Where in Breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:18:15
Regardless seems shady to not show v1 for 2x. It’s even shadier to not create your genesis Block, but instead create 2x from a fork.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:36:27
BCash is a scam coin
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:37:13
Are you a bCash pumper 
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:27:09
Names please

At least they are not Hillary hands
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:48:04
You mad thunder cunt?
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:59:03
I would go Bitcoin.org to learn.
Do not go to Bitcoin.com as that site promotes alt Coins 
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:25:43
Can you post it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:56:35
Faith....just like the US Dollar, the Euro and even the scam bCash
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:50:59
Yeah you are probably right...I hate change :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:14:33
Me too
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:42:31
Why would you want to tax the poor?
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:12:31

@_date: 2017-11-18 22:46:32
Good riddance and on to bCash you go. No need to ever post here.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:35:09
You do need to get 3 jobs :)
The internet is the best education the world has ever  known. With uTube a human can damn near learn anything 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:44:18
Ahh the bCash pumper
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:42:26
I would have them competing for Block space to create more value :)
Alt coins don’t understand this
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:52:22
Tesla has to make money and Bitcoin needs to secure it...I bet on the latter.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:55:55
It is a scam fork
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:42:28
I like to think about intentions when I view alt coins.
Monero: I have heard interviews with Fluffy Pony numerous times talking about it as an experiment. Seems like good intentions.
Ether: when the DAO occurred Vatal and his founders forked their chain. I heard him interviewed that sometimes forks are necessary.
Seems like his intention is to make money 
BCash: from the r/BTC sub you could read over and over how Core was evil, how Segwit was dumb and how 128mb blocks can save the world. Also rather than inherently growing bCash with a genesis Block they fork off and market bCash as Bitcoin.
Seems like they are delusional.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:45:01
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:45:14
That’s government :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:23:03
It is still not in their best interest. For government, fiat is wonderful 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:17:40
Ethereum is centralized. If Vatalic wants to fork...they fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:18:59
If the US banned exchanges, then local bitcoin would explode. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:07:42
I like how I can transfer my Bitcoin security to anyone I want to without a 3rd party :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:35:17
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:56:42
I want the bCash scammers gone
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:37:37
Could be fake news
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:45:56
Are you serious? 
All those homes couldn’t have been purchased if rates were rising instead of falling back then.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:48:41
Thanks. I was pretty sure no banks had been fined from this stupid Russia “scandal.”
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:42:13
You might as well sell if you are scared. Thanks for playing 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:49:30
Damn Frog, your theory on Bitcoin being the one true asset to balance fiat inflation/debt is pretty interesting. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:52:05
I meant version 1.
Since 2x is a new alt coin they should start with genesis Block and grow organically, but that doesn’t make money...only by forking can 2x hope to make money.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:12:03
I have no pencil in my iOS version of Bread
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:15:44
BCash is a scam. Bitcoin just keeps moving forward while being attacked. I will stick with decentralized and immutable.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:20:44
People loose their minds over Elon....carnival barker
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:27:25
Are you mad that bCash is called an alt Coin?
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:35:17
Who is betting on it? How can you bet on it?
There is option market for 2X and that person lost.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:55:37
Old habits are hard to break. Bitcoiners should have thicker skin, myself included, but that attack was epic.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:32:18
Yikes!!!! 
Your savior and almighty is in control :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:33:15
Where in Breadwallet do I choose economy?
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:35:44
Which is?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:32:53
Frog, I like your brain 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:35:19
See poster is all gone, hopefully like the bCash / Bitcoin Cash scam 
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:39:34
I think you and Reddit need a break. If you were put over the edge, then try a timeout.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:22:02
What shop were you in?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:34:33
He is waiting for S11X
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:45:12
Scam coin over Segwit? I am no longer signing in to that app :(
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:31:29
Look up local Bitcoins. Sell something on Craigslist but only accept Bitcoin. Maybe do a search of r/Bitcoin....someone must of asked this question here before.
I purchased honey from a guy at work 2 years ago  using Bitcoin. That darn fool lost his passphrase to his wallet :(
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:16:01
When ETH founders were going to lose money they orchestrated their fork. ETH is centralized 
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:58:22
Nonsense, peer to peer. You don’t have to get Bitcoin off an exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:11:59
What does Block chain oriented mean?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:58:29
Why not? I just moved Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:06:51
And those other coins are centralized so they would be inflating
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:47:42
You can’t control miners. Why do you think Segwit had to be forced upon them?
Jihan never wanted it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:39:53
Or it could rise to $12k and CRASH to $9k :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:54:08
I wish that were true. I am way to skeptical having held some government jobs.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:10:12
How many are decentralized?
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:40:32
Did you see all the great answers?
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:00:50
They need 128mb blocks...that argument is stupid 
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:57:34
Are they going to test it like the 2x code :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:55:19
Yep, they are running an exit scam over there
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:33:08
I agree. Breadwallet is falling behind. No Segwit. No fee calculator :(
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:34:19
It certainly is better to be decentralized. Otherwise, you are at the whims of Roger. That guy is a wanker.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:57:47
Nope. They are fine 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:51:59
I wish Breadwallet would  let me choose my own fee
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:23:08
So when Gold was used as money there was no growth?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:55:20
Amazon is centralized and growing. Bitcoin is decentralized and mooning :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:34:51
I use Bitcoin for payment 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:04:44
I detest Roger and bCash equally :)
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:49:02
Use a wallet that allows you to adjust the fee. Easy peasy 
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:32:56
Nobody knows. Fascinating times with one of the coolest technologies the world has seen.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:58:57
True, but I will not idly sit by and let bCash use the name Bitcoin. That is an outright scam.
@_date: 2017-04-30 15:06:57
Be careful. Those altcoins will scam you out of your money if you are not careful :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:38:34
Impeccable 
@_date: 2017-04-30 16:08:16
Coders are not solving problems that haven't been solved. Bitcoin solved peer to peer without a 3rd party. The US $ is the worlds reserve currency. The world uses it to transact. Bitcoin maybe 2nd for worldwide status, but dark markets definitely use it. If you want speed transactions with merchants then Visa is your gold standard.
These other coins do not have any unique use cases.  Smart contracts are stupid. Contracts need enforcement and resolution which involve courts. In 10 years all these altcoins are gone. 
Just my opinion:)
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:58:33
Scam. Sorry dude it is a money scam from Roger and a miner. You can sympathize all you want with them, but it is an orchestrated scam.
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:17:04
For now
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:43:08
BCash is a scam
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:37:53
Possible...yes. Likely...no
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:16:40
Will do. I still trust math
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:25:30
Agreed, but only the government can keep a monopoly going. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:52:06
So why not get the block size boost from Segwit then determine if a hard fork is needed or a Litecoin solution would help down the road?
Btw, I move Bitcoin 2 days ago and honestly that was the fastest confirmation I have ever received.
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:38:27
Yep...excellent plan. Bitcoin works great for value transfer.
@_date: 2017-04-30 16:24:49
Courts are stupid until you need one.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:58:31
Why can't people still lose their homes?
I have a 10k deductible and if I don't pay where does that money come from?
I can still go bankrupt 
@_date: 2017-04-04 11:59:09
If they both have the same name how do you know one versus the other?
Maybe the device adds "(1)" to the second wifi name that is identical?
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:44:57
Why is that? Society can come up with a different way to tax can't it?
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:22:32
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-04-30 16:47:45

What happens when you run into the other guy at a coffee shop. Whose Bitcoin is the Future will displayed in my phone?
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:22:18
Does anyone use these altcoins for anything other than speculation? At least Bitcoin is used for value transfer and dark markets.
I think Bitcoin will be the only one standing in 10 years after all the scammers are gone.
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:03:29
What exact features do we like about the "affordable" care act?
Higher premiums?
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:43:21
But bitcoin is used for transactions now and serves users (drugs....) needs. I don't see any of the altcoins serving any needs that Bitcoin doesn't provide already, so there is no reason to move to them.

Do you think a bot created the original "broken agreement " post :)

Nothing Frog. I have always liked the simplicity of Breadwallet’s design.
@_date: 2017-04-16 21:26:30
Why doesn't Roger promote Segwit?
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:01:25
I never implied they are just, but they are needed. I am sorry, but smart contracts with a crypto currency just doesn't seem like a viable use case.
@_date: 2017-04-30 12:05:58
It is not good enough, because it is not Rogers plan :)
They want bigger blocks the BU way.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:21:59
Blockchains are a buzzword. I am only aware of Bitcoin. What are other blockchains out there...please don't bring up IBM.

Not if the miners payoff the right people
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:40:57
But isn't innovation removing jobs as well?
It seems like inflation and deflation kinda lead to the same thing except inflation gets you there faster :)
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:29:13
They already have a perfectly useful database. Why the hell would they need a blockchain?
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:00:58
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:41:43
You are right, Hillary visited every key state :)
She was a turd.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:56:00
I vote the central bank. If the CB would have raised rates early on then euphoric home buying would not have been possible. At some point the owner would not be able to afford the home.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:33:29
No. They laughed out how bad Hillary is. Now, some of the Dems are mad at her for bringing Bernie down. She truly was the laughing stock and still is today. Face it, she was the biggest turd in history. She is the McCaine of the Dem party. Eventually they will be gone from "service."
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:18:47
Hillary was the worst ever. She is not electable 
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:41:15
Bill uses his brain and chooses a different wallet. Bill also realizes that his transaction could contain the highest fee in the world and a miner can still mine an empty block.

What is investing in blockchains mean?
@_date: 2017-09-08 10:09:00
My point is ICO fools literally are giving money away with no equity stake. How is it any different than Go Fund Me?
With every fool they use less of their own money.

But Japan has a central bank, so are they not good at promoting the good inflation?

Too much money in the system.
I simply asked if dollars were valuable then prices should fall and the poster said nobody would lend. That is where my question came from

@_date: 2017-09-18 14:30:18
She was a turd. You just can't admit it. Even Dems had a "never Hillary."
Women in droves distanced themselves from her.

They should have done ICO 1st....use fools money and their own
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:29:49
Bitcoin is fine without Roger and better off too. Drug users and gamblers don't talk of needing bCash.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:33:52

R/BTC is bCash. I rarely visit. They have a coin that does everything they want. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:47:24
I believe you, but you make a claim as fact and someone asks for a source and you tell them to look it up and do their own homework?

That is fine but ETH is not capped

Probably drive the price up more

"It seems to me that the enthusiasm for bitcoin is a little bit out of proportion to its immediate application," Shiller said. "I don't know, maybe it's possible that you can still ride this bubble on bitcoin. But I keep thinking there'll be other currencies, other ideas [that] will come up and will eclipse this one. So it's risky."
Duh.

They would never want a public ledger.

That is still not making sense to me. When I worked for a mortgage company 8 years ago it was involved in a consortium of other mortgage companies that shared data about home values. The consortium wasn’t running a blockchain. 
I am still not getting it.

@_date: 2017-09-27 10:28:44
Indeed. Nobody has band me for wanting 128mb blocks. Which seems perfectly logical :)

A blockchain does all that?

Good question, but bCash was free money to me :)
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:01:52
How will they be able to tell HOW much work was done?
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:59:41
Not sure, but if you go to r/BTC it is full on pumping of that alt coin. They don’t even have the decency to get a new sub. They prey on Newbies who pop into it thinking they are learning about Bitcoin.
It is shameful 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:04:41
Broken..uhg. Calm down.
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:14:28
Agreed, but the central bank could have stopped this in its tracks but they chose to continue lowering rates :(
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:59:42
I am ok with it, but I hate the bCash pumpers 
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:42:15

They tried Bitcoin Cash, but the bCash is in a price free fall. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:05:40
It is not fun...very confusing. It is like reading about Eutherium projects and how it can cure cancer :)
I will keep trying.
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:39:07
I am not advocating it. I was just curious. Thanks
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:24:24
I am still struggling with what rights does a person who owns an ICO coin have?
@_date: 2017-10-11 09:36:41
Can you have 16mb Blocks and a miner decides  to exclude your transaction from a Block?
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:50:44
I thought Bitcoin Cash was bCash
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:56:08
Why would Businesses dealing with a blockchain trust the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:34:50
No. It is worth less
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:16:26
You mean a database like Oracle
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:06:36
Or just move your business from New York. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:40:03
Seems very shady. I warn Newbs in r/BTC that bCash is not Bitcoin and people are pumping that crap there
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:08:48
Do you think since energy is one of a miners cost that they aren’t constantly thinking of ways to improve their efficiency?
I agree the prof can complain, but the argument seems flimsy.
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:45:46
You don't know what a blockchain is or does :(
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:12:38
Instead of 2M why not 128M?
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:18:12
Yep, MySQL and Oracle can do that too. If a Blockchain is just a database it is nothing new.
@_date: 2017-09-25 00:04:28
They would have to hedge the price fluctuation, so I don't see the point of accepting it.
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:24:09
You know...you know
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:39:02
That is a cool idea. I wish
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:24:13
But the mortgage consortium is trusted. It is a legal entity that each company is a shareholder.
Why would people/companies trust a decentralized blockchain? Where is the incentive? 
In the consortium example, how would a blockchain remove the needs for a consortium? The consortium’s job was to collect data from the shareholders and share it when needed.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:24:51
I had no problem 
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:31:32
Why did they create bCash?
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:33:25
I think bCash is useful. I was able to convert it to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:55:29
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:08:11
What if the delay in sending money is to protect themselves and consumers?
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:58:53
R/BTC is crazy in love with bCash...pumpers delight

r/BTC is mainly for shilling bCash which is an alt Coin. I am shocked Reddit doesn’t step in. Clear exit scam being run on that sub.

But in a deflating currency won't prices fall?
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:26:07
It is too centralized. If Val wants to take it in a different direction like a fork, then Ether gets a fork.
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:41:43
Transaction fees have not been high for me. My last 3 transactions made it in under 15 min.
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:58:52
We dodged a bullet. Hillary was the worst candidate ever.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:43:36
Please give me your failed fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:04:55
How do you know what each miner needs in incentives?
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:41:38
I know you are still butt hurt, but trust us...she was the worst candidate of all time.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:16:31
I guess I need to study some more...I am just not getting it. Blockchain seems like some magical carpet. For a decentralized crypto currency I get blockchain for anything else...I don’t.
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:16:50
During the fork would it be advantageous for people on these nodes to transact Bitcoin with high fees to encourage miners to mine the Core version?
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:12:22
I love how the left chastises people for body shaming...name the SJW cause but when "they" do it...it is ok. The Wikileaks's emails of the DNC making fun of Bernie were funny. I know you are butt hurt, but you will be fine and we will all be fine.
Go outside and enjoy life. You don't need to wring your hands of Hillary's failures...she did this to herself. You are not guilty and neither is Russia or Connely. Hillary is the one to blame. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:21:11
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:55:28
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:15:57
Agree. I like Bitcoin as another life option and not something that governments should fear.
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:04:01
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:58:11
Yes the democrats 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:24:54
Why are you so angry 
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:00:38
So was Enron
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:23:22
That is the beauty of Bitcoin it doesn’t not care about right or left politics 
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:52:36
Throw MCI in there too.
The point is to diversify, IMHO.
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:33:22

I am sure that is it ;)

Hillary derailed herself because she was a turd. The Dems ran the wrong candidate.

What color is the sky in your world 
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:45:03
How do you know volumes are up?
Are the reported numbers audited by anyone?
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:18:49
BScam :)
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:16:18
Roger and Jihan could have had Segwit for a long time? They have BU. Why haven't they led this?
@_date: 2018-04-22 10:48:35
Does anyone audit these claims?
@_date: 2017-05-07 19:12:37
I like how Bitcoin provides scarcity. With ETH they just hard fork when the founders don't like something...
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:18:04
Or like Al Gore who believes that man who is causing it :)
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:12:46
You are funny :)
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:57:05
This is gentleman 
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:31:09
Hello serious ETH competition?
Omg that is funny
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:14:18
Nope. He doesn't want it at all. It is very clear. 
Otherwise, he would have started with Segwit and when it didn't fulfill his needs go, then come back to the community and say "see, we need a 2,4 or 6mb increase."
That is how most business people would conduct a deal when they want something. Segwit is clearly against his business.
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:21:15
Gloating looks ugly on a person 
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:45:33
Haha...you are funny. Roger could have led us to Segwit long ago. He doesn't want it. If he really wanted BU he would have forked. Roger doesn't want change, but talks big.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:15:26
Nope. He has never wanted Segwit. He could have led on this, but has never wanted it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:50:40
That is the definition of a scam...they pick winners and losers
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:31:48
He doesn't want Segwit. That is very clear.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:47:29
Yep, but it goes to trust...I don't trust ETH. Trust is a foundation.for me You may trust it, but I don't and probably never will. I am weird that way :)
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:56:05
What is the negative side affect?
This is part of the "deal" from the China agreement 
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:44:13
But To be clear, Jihan does not want Segwit 
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:30:27
Jihan will NEVER do Segwit. If he wanted it, then he would implement it and the tell everyone we still need 2mb. Notice how he won't do it that way...it always contains a condition. Always.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:38:48
How reliable are these market share  Are these exchanges regulated? Could exchanges publish bogus transactions?

Some people are so desperate to get Trump they will do anything. Birthers of a different side of the aisle.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:28:17
Oops not developers. Every time I search I get results of its the developers...I want to understand who are the parties involved in the contracts and the terms. Forums I have read say that these contracts are basically test contracts and no commerce is involved.
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:32:44
Huh 
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:39:30
Yep. Most of those coins are scams.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:26:27
I don't believe you ever used Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:20:25
They can't scale...maybe they need Roger and Jihan :)
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:38:35
ETH will eventually go away. They hard forked to protect the founders money...if they did it once they will do it again.
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:42:22
Yep Roger and Jihan have 0 interest in Segwit or even a straight up increase...they would have forked for BU. Something is holding them back.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:32:00
It appears if you want to pay a low fee then 4 days.
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:59:33
Who is writing contracts with ETH? Speculators?

@_date: 2017-05-31 15:54:54
If he wanted Segwit it would have been done by now. Even if he wanted it to get to 2mb. But He does NOT want Segwit...how hard is that to see. Talk is cheap. He has had no action. It is very clear...he does not want Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:11:24
Well stated!
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:38:33
You can trust it when the founders control the value...right?
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:25:11
What color is the sky in your world?
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:22:02
You are not being very smart 
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:24:17
The latter. ETH founders will get fined for running a security and possibly go to jail. 
Plus all these alt coins are not solving problems 
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:43:40
Jihan does not want Segwit, so it will be tough.
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:08:02
All I can think of is a blockchain powered machine running off the power that cleans the  solar panels to create perpetual motion ;)
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:18:07
The Dao
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:46:34
ETH was a centralized HF to protect the founders money. VB's idea to save his money.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:45:55
Jihan does not want Segwit 
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:51:28
No, Bitcoin is fine for me.
ETH is a scam if they help some and not others. That means centralization :)
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:02:01
Don't use their wallet. Find some other wallet that supports it.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:21:11
Jihan has the most power in mining. You ask him and. Roger 
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:00:47
Agreed but it is very clear that Jihan does not want Segwit 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:58:32
I don't know what that means...sorry
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:36:52
Breadwallet calculates the fee for you
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:24:18
It doesn't matter. Can't you see that?
If he wanted Segwit he would push for it. He doesn't want it.
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:12:26
Ha...good one
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:04:25
That is the price of anonymity 
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:27:58
Jihan and Roger want one
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:31:13
Because your trusty credit card is old :)
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:54:47
Nope. He won't implement it.
He always has an extra condition. He is not leading, because he does NOT want Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:14:45
Yep he doesn't want Segwit 
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:34:21
He is not leading. He does NOT want Segwit. That is very clear.
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:15:28
Why haven't you sold all your Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:25:24
Yep. Jihan does not want Segwit 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:39:24
What if you don't get to 1500....you will never buy again :(
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:27:25
Segwit will happen. Jihan is smart but I think he overplayed his hand.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:16:35
ETH is a scam. The Dao proved that.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:56:22
How do you know the numbers are real? Are they audited? 
What am I not getting :(
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:31:16
Because if the founders think they will lose money they will fork. Not decentralized. Scam
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:48:27
I wish Roger would have hard forked his 2,4,10, 88mb idea...this is the only way to get rid of his hurt feelings 
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:18:22
A fool and his money are soon parted.
@_date: 2017-07-09 13:24:25
We better solve the 10 year problem right now. I propose 80 MB blocks just in case.
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:39:18
I think Jihan doesn't want Segwit. He has not been a leader in getting it implemented.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:32:28
No but there are a lot here.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:46:58
That won't happen either. Jihan has no intention to activate Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:52:25
My apologies but I don't know what that means
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:12:26
He is not willing to run it. If he wanted it, then he would lead. He is not leading. He obfuscates on purpose. He does not want Segwit. If he did he would drop his other demands and then come back and tell us why we need to hard fork to his bigger block size. A shrewd businessman would do that, BUT Segwit must be a threat to him.
@_date: 2017-05-15 11:48:30
Why would growth slow? 
I have never understood this argument. When people need things they will buy. People can't hoard cash indefinitely.
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:00:34
It is very clear Jihan does not want Segwit. I am with him wanting to protect his business, but to do so dishonestly is shameful.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:14:46
Yep....Roger is stalling. Why?
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:25:53
BCash 
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:19:44
Who uses ETH?
Drug users?
Gambling sites?
Shopping sites?
Nobody but speculators...it will die a slow death.
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:32:38
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-05-05 18:19:36
Once I read "working with IBM" I stopped reading. IBM is a hype machine with no viable products and an over priced consulting arm. IBM is dying a slow death.

Is there a good source for installing Bip 148 on Umbuntu for a noob?
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:18:00
He will NEVER agree to Segwit. That is very clear.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:23:14
There is no shame only a lot of butt hurt press. 
Shame has always been with Presidents. For some reason they have taken a liken to killing people with drones.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:34:25
Because he doesn't want it. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:18:21
No it is crystal clear that he does not want it. He has shown zero leadership for it.
He obfuscates.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:08:38
It will not fail in my opinion. Bitcoins primary use case is a store of value, but Segwit enables a 2nd layer...Roger does not want that or like I wrote he would fork to BU. Roger is not telling the community his true beliefs.
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:34:19
I am not waiting about 10 minutes for my coffee transaction to confirm. I know Roger does but he likes waiting for his coffees.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:06:22
You are very angry.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:56:50
Yep...I am down on Roger. He is not someone to admire.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:23:43
Bingo 
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:56:53
He has had plenty of time to get Segwit, but he doesn't want it.
@_date: 2017-05-07 10:54:36
I wish Coinbase would drop ETH or at least give me the ability to remove it from my mobile device. Nobody uses it.
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:07:05
Maybe he likes fees
@_date: 2017-07-09 22:42:53
I am not calling him a villain and he may have his own reasons for not supporting Segwit, but it is tiring reading posts from people that say he wants it. His actions say otherwise.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:20:58
Come on DarthRusty people like Roger need their coffee within 10 minutes. Do you think they care about capital gains or losses :)
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:10:36
If he thought Segwit was good he would have pushed for it, but he kept making these other demands which to me shows dishonesty or lack of leadership..I pick dishonesty.
He could have implemented Segwit without and increase and told the community "See, we need a 2mb increase too."
He clearly does not want Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:21:18
Can you move?
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:33:39
It is pretty easy. FUD is produced by Jihan and Roger.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:29:43
Why doesn't Roger and Jihan support Segwit?
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:38:19
It is pretty clear that Jihan did not want Segwit or he would have pushed for it.
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:36:58
I think it is more about Jihan not wanting Segwit
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:04:49
Nope 
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:17:47
Quotes please
@_date: 2017-07-04 10:59:52
I don't know about that but it is clear that Jihan does not want Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:42:39
No kidding. I honestly do not know who was more corrupt Fannie/Freddie or rating agencies 
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:04:07
Why are you so angry? Are you from /BTC
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:56:33
Come on now.
Roger and Jihan had a chance to lead...all they did was a circle jerk
@_date: 2017-07-11 12:15:49
Just going by the definition....don't get your undies in a bundle
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:55:47
I don't think it will contain Segwit. Jihan has proven that he does not want Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:00:07
Isn't capacity what is needed?
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:00:23
It's ok
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:37:01
Bombs, guns, plans...killing machines. Do I think this will go on forever? No, but right now the world has no real alternative option.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:58:57
The left is going nuts with Trump, so it is easier to remind them of their corruption and running the worst candidate of all time....it's like turning the screws :)
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:18:20
Kept them low and lowered them when he should have been raising them. That is their job. 
Do I blame them 100%? No, but it is pretty high up there.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:31:09
Nope. If they really really like and want Segwit than put it in and then do the big "I told you so" later. Core would have the proverbial egg on the face.
Jihan does not want Segwit. It is that clear.
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:23:11
Where there are humans, there will be inequality.
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:03:45
Yep, but those users have a choice. None of them use ETH.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:14:48
I remember when Fannie and Freddie had No Income No Asset and No Income No Doc loans...geez those were crazy times.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:58:03
I bet you can buy a cup of coffee with it
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:29:15
You are funny.
Jihan and Roger do not want Segwit 
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:33:19
Roger doesn't want any changes. If he did he would have gotten BU forked with his mega block so he can buy his coffee on chain.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:27:47
There is no "our" in Bitcoin. Jihan does not want Segwit that is clear. Hopefully, we can force change.
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:19:55
We shall see. I wonder why Jihan doesn't want Segwit. Litecoin is using it...hmmm
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:37:25
Not a bot...just an observation of words and actions. In Jihan's case it is crystal clear. He may have business reasons for not wanting Segwit, but we know he is not leading.
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:50:56
Don't come on hear with you're wild assertions...we need 8mb blocks now!
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:53:15
Jihan absolutely does not want Segwit. You can tell by his lack of leadership.
He could push for Segwit now, then come back to the community and say "see, that didn't help, we need an additional block size increase."
Instead, he obfuscates.
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:07:19
Are the volume numbers fabricated? How would we know?
Is there an external audit?
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:02:22
Yes, that is what I meant :)
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:47:42
I do too. The DNC and Hillary really rolled him.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:35:51
Rational according to whom?
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:08:27
I like USAF more. Jihan and Roger had plenty of time to lead but all they did was stall. They could have done BU...but they didn't. They have been obstinate the entire time. Why?
They could have done this long ago.
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:26:25
Awe you are still mad that Hillary and the DNC took out Bernie :)
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:28:54
We agree to disagree. Whatever the Fed does controls our economy. They have that kind of power. In my opinion, they did not do their job. They have access to an incredible amount of financial data.
Just imagine if the Fed raised the Fed Fund rate 2% right now or stopped buying Federal debt or told other central banks to not buy Federal debt?
It would be crazy to watch the news.

I wonder if the Bank of Thailand owns any Bitcoin?
Some guy sitting at a desk saying "I am gonna take a flier on this Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:39:40
Ah come on now :)
@_date: 2017-07-13 00:23:25
Ahh cheap money allows people to borrow more. Don't kid a kidder. The job of the Fed is to throttle the economy, but they left the throttle wide open.
Plus you throw in Fannie make making loans outside their guidelines and that is a recipe for disaster.
I worked right in the middle of that shit show.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:32:25
He knows what he is doing. Dishonest people have their ways...eventually it catches up to them.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:45:59
Do they get used often?
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:10:57
Agreed, but when you don't have enough money in your account do you want them to give you free money?

Can miners choose which transactions get into a block?
If yes, could the government(s) ever tell miners to not include a transaction from an address they link to say a child molester?
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:16:56
Yep. Segwit 
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:38:22
@_date: 2017-07-23 01:09:23
Thankfully we have Segwit 
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:13:29
I worked for a subsidiary of GMAC. We did origination and securitization. Fannie was the 800lbs gorilla. If a loan was run thru their desktop underwriter tool and was approved, then we couldn't touch it. It was funny how Fannie approved more and more loans outside their guidelines and they squeezed out players. By the end they were buying subprime loans and nobody cared.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:44:31
How does node centralization occur with Segwit?
@_date: 2017-07-11 12:09:55
Just going by Merriam:
often capitalized :  a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.
Looks like present day China to me
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:56:12
If Jihan wanted Segwit we would have it by now
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:39:40
Funny how it was the same Fed that caused the housing crisis :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:42:58
That may be the case, but it still is true. Personally, I want to be the person that I would admire ;)
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:16:57
You are funny.
Jihan does not want Segwit because it is bad for his business. I don't blame him for not wanting it, but to be so dishonest about it...is shameful.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:21:40
Ha...how do I know I am not chatting with a Bot :)
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:38:18
Because Segwit by itself did Jihan harm...what exactly? I don't know, but he sure has not led on Segwit 
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:27:27
Nobody wants to read good news ;)
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:15:07
The only problem is Jihan does not want Segwit 
@_date: 2017-07-06 02:55:15
The banks and private lenders only had 3 choices for rating their securities, but each of them would produce the same rating :)
Fannie was a beast of their own, they were the 800 lbs gorilla. They bought outside their guidelines all the time. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:02:56
Yes it does
@_date: 2017-07-04 01:50:25
Why doesn't Jihan want Segwit? 
He clearly does not want it :(
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:02:44
I want Segwit and Jihan clearly does not want Segwit, so is there any other choice?
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:04:58
But you are still mad...let it go
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:34:36
Bernanke headed the Fed.
What back door dealings are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:53:32
I am not a Bank lover by any means. But isn't an Overdraft stealing from other depositors...the bank itself? I guess arguments could be made that the fee is too high or the bank held back a deposit to enact a fee. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 12:53:22
I agree. Roger and Jihan could have sent each other numerous bitcoin transactions over and over again with a very small transaction fee...they don't care :)
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:45:10
What color is the sky in your world?
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:19:27
Not if the US is the default world's currency...the world wants US dollars. At this point, the US can basically do what they want.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:55:03

I think Trump is super clever. He stole DNC voters right out from under Hillary who will go down as the worst candidate the DNC ever put out there.
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:46:28
Your feelings are hurt...sorry Trump did that to you.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:55:58
Jihan doesn't want Segwit 
@_date: 2017-07-03 09:53:41
Not a chance. He has no influence 
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:11:16
I am anti big news agencies....I find Trump funny how he trolls them. He is not my first choice but anybody that can rile them up gives me a shimmer of hope.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:38:05
I am not sure that can happen to the worlds reserve currency...well maybe. The US exports inflation now.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:10:36
Nope. I just want to re-iterate for newbies that Jihan's history has shown that he is against Segwit.
If he did want it we would have it by now :)
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:19:01
Were you spending money you did have?
@_date: 2017-05-03 02:57:06
Who uses ETC?
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:47:15
Forced on them...we will see if Jihan wants Segwit. He has not led in this area at all.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:48:44
I just look at action. Jihan &amp; Ver have had every opportunity to lead on activating Segwit. It is clear they do not want it.
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:27:11
I am sorry that you are still mad. Let go.
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:05:45
I totally agree.
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:52:56
Jihan does not want Segwit. It is clear from his non leadership.
He could have said Ok to Segwit and then came back to the community later and told them "I told you so."
I wonder why he doesn't want it?
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:57:08
Can you move $5m via PayPal?
I wish I had $5m worth of Bitcoin to move :(

Is Breadwallet allowing users to connect to a node running BIP148?
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:42:49
Talk is cheap. His lack of action is telling.
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:12:58
I wish Jihan wanted Segwit. This would have been much more simpler.
@_date: 2017-05-01 00:37:55
If you believe in your convictions then short Canadian banks
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:16:16
The Feds job is to throttle the economy. Several sharp rate increases would have severely dented the runaway euphoria. The cost of borrowing would have gone up, but the Fed kept lowering rates.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:05:23
Now don't try and throw statistics at us. We need 2mb now, not 10 minutes ago. I can't believe you agreed to 2 when we clearly need 8mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:52:13
Calm down David
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:47:10
He doesn't want Segwit

I think fascism is the result of unchecked power.
One could argue that China is fascist.

I want to buy my coffee on chain
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:23:05
I don't look at it like that...maybe after Segwit he maintains his mining dominance. I don't care.
I just want Segwit so people can work on Layer 2 and Roger can get his coffee faster than 10 minutes 
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:12:53
Why doesn't Jihan want Segwit?
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:31:01
We also use it for drugs, gambling and sex...like the US dollar
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:23:50
Circle WAS great :(
@_date: 2017-07-03 09:54:51
It is pretty clear the your scenario will not happen
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:46:13
He is not leading. If he wanted Segwit he would have asked for that first, then told everyone why it wasn't enough of a block increase. He did not do that.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:40:43
It's ok. You will be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:57:08
Why are you so mad?
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:46:01
That means nothing. He has taken no leadership 
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:44:15
I don't think so. Jihan has snubbed its progress to date. He has not led.
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:44:49
Yep. Jihan absolutely does not want Segwit. He "forced" this on the community 
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:53:04
Do we get to see that guy?
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:06:42
Cheap money dude. Cheap money. If the Fed raised interest rates the speculation would have slowed or stopped.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:04:46
Jihan isn't going to do anything, because he doesn't want Segwit. That is very clear to see.
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:07:15
You are a chart reader. I like your mind. You should put together a crypto newsletter and charge for it.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:59:37
Whether he signals or not is immaterial. He does not want nor has he ever wanted Segwit 
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:15:42
I see what you did there :)
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:25:34
Proof of Steak...mmmm
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:41:30
But is happened right? ETC isn't decentralized if the founders can fork their losses away.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:09:01
He has had his chance...numerous times. He will not lead.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:17:37
It is pretty self evident that Jihan does not want Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:45:14
What if OP only had 50 cents worth of Bitcoin:)
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:30:59
Segwit already increases the block size.
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:40:07
America has a stable government, cash, visa and MC...those are very tough hurdles to adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:11:57

@_date: 2017-06-16 21:45:55
ETH is centralized. They forked to save the founders money. If Bitmain or Roger want to fork have at it...it is much more honest.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:08:22
I have no idea, but it is clear he doesn't want Segwit 
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:21:40
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:41:19
ETH is a centralized solution. If you don't like the outcome of the chain, then you fork it.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:55:49
No, that is the BTC folk
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:47:56
I am saying he doesn't want Segwit. History has shown this. He clearly does NOT want Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:25:19
Yeah I don't know if the latter can be proven, but it is very clear that Jihan does not like Segwit 
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:29:16
No ad wall for me
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:54:32
Jealous you are ;)
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:00:55
My point is he doesn't want it. Never has.
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:18:15
I bet he/she doesn't 
@_date: 2017-06-16 23:32:29
Forked via V
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:54:52
Not true. He does NOT want Segwit. He has never wanted it. His lack of leadership shows that he does not want Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:31:25
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:15:56
Until ETH forks again to protect the founder's money ;)
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:39:46
Like ETH
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:56:23
Until they fork again to save the founder's money ;)
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:22:10
Jihan doesn't want Segwit...+2 was his way of ensuring it wouldn't happen 
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:56:55
Yeah Basic Income is being pushed hard. I don't see how it is going to work yet, but they are trying to do something about idle hands from automation.
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:25:50
Tell them to HODL :)
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:18:15
Jihan could have had Segwit by itself...he doesn't want it.
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:56:50
This...is my father
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:19:47
Proof please

Damn you pokertravis

Nobody uses it for anything other than speculation 
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:01:07
I wish BU would fork away and we would be done with that clown show. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:09:42
Good explanation 
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:09:11
Jihan does not want Segwit. His action of no action speaks volumes.
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:56:47
Doubtful, but he is at the mercy of congress. Their job is to increase the debt ceiling so more money is available to spend.

Governments can kill Bitcoin by allowing anything goes. Until then, someone hiding from laws will need Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:47:02
Yes there is. The returns are substantial :)
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:52:06
We had a bank run on the gold standard. Fractional reserve banking can be done with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:54:32
That will never happen. All the Central banks buy each other's currency.

@_date: 2017-06-30 11:19:26
That's fine. Bitcoin will survive and Segwit will happen. Jihan is a terrible leader.
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:58:56
Did you tell them how the founder's hard forked to save their money?
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:28:52
ETH is centralized. They forked previously to protect the founder's money...why wouldn't they do it again?
Not very trustworthy 
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:08:12
Yes indeed. Sadly their money is gone.
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:53:41
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:40:04
I wish the SewitX2 crowd would just fork already and go away. Sadly Jihan will never do it because he doesn't want Segwit. He is all talk and no leadership 
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:28:46
Why does economics matter? Serious question.
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:51:47
Jihan 100% does NOT want Segwit 
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:31:28
Why do you that is?
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:54:33
I would be nervous if I was Vitalik. Forking to save your money at the expense of others strikes me as a little disingenuous and certainly not immutable.
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:53:12
The economist is run by young college kids.
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:33:49
Make sure to include the Fed for driving down interest rates and to Fannie and Freddie who made loans well beyond their guidelines (subprime)
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:37:57
Why won't Jihan activate Segwit?
As a leader he could have done it then under his claims that the community needs 2mb could have said "see Segwit alone is not enough."
He has done nothing, because he does NOT want Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:00:40
IL is a very interesting case. A state that is in bankruptcy due to politicians. A city or county running out of money is one thing, but have we seen a state in bankruptcy before IL?
I am sure it has happened.
