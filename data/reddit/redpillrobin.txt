This is during a good economic period. The next economic downturn you will see people panic buying bitcoin and other Crypto to a point unheard of. That's when fiat forks to Bitcoin and checkmate. The tyranny will be over. Many will think of Satoshi Nakomoto a prophet like Moses sent to free the people.

If you don't like the year 2017 in the western world go build a time machine and go land in King Loui' s court hang with those royals for a day. They  had nothing compared to a western middle class person today. We set our temperatures to our liking. We drive cars and fly through the air around the world. We don't eat what's available we choose from all the world's bounty. I know that's no big deal to us but go live without it for a year and see how freaking lucky we are.

 You are talking to people who believe whats on the media is directly involved in there own personal world. So they hear about all this things like London terror attack 7 dead and they think they were apart of it. They miss the understanding that most of them never seen a dead person outside a funeral home and the biggest problem they face is eating to much food and being fat.  
When obesity is a major concern in your time of life you are living in a land of plenty. I see how lucky we are and good for you to be grateful for also seeing how much peace and prosperity we were lucky to inherit. But many suffered bad in WW2 and we are benefactors.

Its not about the price of a BTC. Hell it can be any crypto. But the cold hard truth is a complete financial network is being created and the next big down turn It will be there to catch everyone. The bankers are starting to realize this. The next Lehman Bros. fiasco there is a good chance of crypto becoming the coin of the realm. With enough panic we could see the all the centralized governments bankrupted and Liberty Loving people holding the only way transact. Regardless of how long it may take, there will be A tipping point. Centralized authority has caused more death and destruction on mankind than any other. Centralized government has been a blight on mankind for thousands of years.
