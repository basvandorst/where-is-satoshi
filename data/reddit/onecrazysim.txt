I would bet most people here heard of banks from their parents complaining and TV and never had a credit themselves. Newsflash, businesses need credit to finance themselves to improve or create their business, they don't start rich.

I guess we shall wait and see :) Personally I believe the problems solved by bitcoin are better solved by new standards in finance, mainly about quick and cheap transfers. As for bitcoins being intangible, not a chance since assets can be also confiscated by goverments. The real fight should be for responsible governance.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:34:57
Absolutely, you need an easy to reach motive to get people onboard. That is also how extreme political parties get to power.

Most expensive is the lawyer and connections to get a bank behind the exchange. Don't really know how much, but I bet over 10k
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:45:08
But the government issues the order to print money, no one else. Banks have had their problems from corruption at the top of some banks, but they are merely an instrument.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:40:33
Inflation is a goverment and economy problem, has nothing to do with banks. Also you can't blame anyone else gor bad financial planning, you should save money in a strong currency

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:44:08
But you can create additional coins with the same value proposition, virtual currency. Doesn't that break limited supply theory?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:05:04
I argue they would trade the same value of cows since they have the same value proposition. Unless society was collectively convinced that blue potatoes are worth more, sparking a domino effect of people trying to get blue potatoes, causing their value to rise more.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:08:18
Lets say there is a limited supply of blue potatoes, but they have the same taste as any ordinary potato, which purchase is more sensible if you have little money and you need to eat? The cheaper one ?

What does adoption have to do with price ? User adoption brings economy of scale which actually decreases price. I don't see causation here with adoption

With bitconnect
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:50:16
I see it rather similar to the altcoins market. If an investor sells their SEK  back to euro, then the SEK will suffer if central bank can't buy back all the SEK with euro reserve. Why would bitcoin be different?
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:58:40
So, just about now. The screeching has stopped
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:43:56
I guess what I am saying is that prices of currencies that are not at the top will dump, there won't be another investor like you say, there will be only the central bank trying to extinguish the fire until it runs out of liquidity.

Yet so much has changed with bitcoin compared to the previous bear period. The crash trigger was not the biggest exchange exit scamming, so many more companies are involved with bitcoin and accept bitcoin, economy cycle is turning towards a recession. I think the comparison is useless and right now the price suppressed to let the institutions accumulate the most
