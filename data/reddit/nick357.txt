What’s a CPFA?

He could have pulled a Paul Walker in one of those cars. If your above ground you should be appreciative.

I am an etherum shill. Are we cool?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:35:07
Yeah, this isn't my retirement money. This is my risky business money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:21
Any idea what is happening then?

I put all of our emergency money in it!
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:22:10
Yeah, your right. I should think about this. Right now I have $35 going into emergency fund each week. I changed that to $35 for bitcoin and $5 for emergency funds. I got caught up.

Are long-term capital gains still taxes with the 5/15 rule? If your income tax rate is 15 percent or less then long term capital gains taxes at 5 percent. Everything over is taxed at 15 percent.

You could have been hit by a car too. So overall I think you are still up. At least, that’s what I tell myself.

Does Bitcoin decrease in value after a fork?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:06:55
I mean if society collapses and we’re forced to scavenge for food and shelter, bitcoin won’t be worth much. So you can look forward to that!

I don’t have any more folding money to put in at this moment. Probably get more soon and was wondering if I should wait until after or do it as soon as possible.

I have a weekly buy so I have some at top dollar too. Fuck it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:18:11
I but X amount every week automatically so I will end up buying some at the top of the market.

My parents held Apple stock all through the 80s and 90s then sold it in 2000!

Many years since my CPA exam. That net investment income tax is pretty wild. I can't believe they got that through.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:48:35
Oh yeah, I have a weekly auto buy for $20 or so. Maybe I should look to bolster that.

Like sand through the hourglass, these are the days of our lives.
