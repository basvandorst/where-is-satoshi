Maybe I'm having a senior moment but what is API?
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:36:11
It's just a question. I thought some discussion on the matter might be appropriate. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:19:32
I think that is pretty obvious. Though I could ammend my statement to say "since December 2013". 
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:18:05
Except that I've tried "buying low" for months and the price has been going lower. Like a bouncing ball losing momentum on it's way back to zero. People are losing money and I'm getting sick of the blind optimism. I've tried to have that all year and as of now I'm at the all time high of regretting that.

I've been at a 25% loss for a while and it's really frustrating and makes me question getting involved. I guess I picked a bad time to jump in. I wish I moved when I was watching for a year as the price climbed. I had hesitations at $20/btc but got on WAY after that. Where is that crystal ball when I need it? At the 25% loss I'm not in a hurry to spend any.

Seaman leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth.

Sorry. It's my fault. Every time I think we are at a floor I buy a bitcoin. Then shortly after the price drops again. This has happened after every purchase I've made in the last 10 months or so. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:46:51
Since early July the value has been on a steady decline with no real sign of stopping. I just have to be realistic.

'Cause he only has half of his bike left right?

So your bank isn't letting you spend your money in the way that you want to. More reasons to move away from banks...

I started with bitcoin for a few reasons. One being the deflation of the US dollar and hedging against it. Another being that I saw the value increasing and thought there was potential for much more growth. Also the technology seems very interesting and very promising. At this point I've been feeding the furnace and have no idea where the value of bitcoin will stabilize. There has been loads of adoption, awareness, and so called good news but I have no idea if it will turn around in terms of the price point. Thanks for chiming in.

Which is what I've been trying to do, I'm down 20% right now. Bitcoin hasn't been exciting for me in well over 6 months. The floor keeps going lower. Optimism is waining. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:34:13
Thank YOU. That is what I was assuming and hoping to confirm. Thanks for chiming in and for helping find this and get the word out.
@_date: 2014-09-19 10:35:42
Means very little to anyone who started buying ~~a year ago~~ 9 months ago. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:15:27
...and 9 months ago it was 1000. You know what the f I'm taking about.
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:17:11
Okay, who is being dramatic here? You are being a contrarian in this thread to a trolling extent. I get it. I just also have opinions to express. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:45:08
Buy high, let the value plummet to the floor. That's better? I've lost 8% more since posting this.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:17:58
CoinThief. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:44:34
That's easy to say if you got in before 11 months ago. I'm now down almost 50%. I've only even been "up" for short periods a while back. I don't care what a chart looks like that starts at less than $1. I realize people want to be optimistic but sometimes you have to cut your losses. I should have yesterday since it's been steadily going down. The writing might very well be on the wall here. I'm sick of people trying to give me perspective that predates my activity with Bitcoin. From my point of view it's a shit show in the last many months. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:06:56
My question is about the CoinThief Trojan. I think it's answerable. I'm trying to verify that it was not distributed via the Apple Store but only via other outlets redistributing the few different softwares it went out in. I'm pretty sure my rig was clean of the Trojan. Just running a peace of mind query. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:32:06
More using/buying than selling/holding. Right?
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:26:43
Whoops. I of course meant, first BTC that I DIDN'T buy. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:57:46
In theory that sounds great. One thing I hate about saving USD is inflation. So far BTC is not a great alternative. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:57:17
Um. Isn't that almost 2 million dollars in TODAYS price?
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:08:19
I did the same thing when it was well under $20. It was more complicated to buy and I didn't have the foresight unfortunately. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:20:20
I had ten and held them for years. Dumped right before the last big spike. Still mad at myself. Some were bought for $100 ish.
