Yes, if you also knew a way to earn enough money to send out the shares because they are withdrawable on BetRobot so it's not a total scam. I spoke with a few people who got their money back and started getting pure profit.

BetRobot is up and running as we speak. All bots are scams and BetRobot has come back from problems while GlobalCryptoBot will just shut down some day instead of fixing it, that's the most probable outcome for new bots. There are quite a bunch of them out there at the moment. That's why you'll want to focus your investments on something that has already proved being worked on, even during tough times.
Which bot is more reliable do you guys think?

There are quite a few times that they have not sent news about the bot when being down. We will have to wait and see if there is any difference this time.
All I know is that there is a difference between you and me. You are trying to sell your bot to get referrals while I am writing an honest review about the bot. You want money from people and I want readers which costs people nothing.
The one trying to get your money or the one just trying to get your attention? There is nothing directly wrong with what you are doing but when you spam my threads you must be prepared to face my opinions and allow the truth behind what you are doing to surface and get exposed. Exposure is the reason why I am posting here after all :)
These are a couple of clear examples:
Salesman CaliDinor: OMG join this amazing and new bot TODAY and earn lots of money!!!
Blogger MeiSoi: Check out my blog and see what happens when we try this bot out.

What you mean "did"? BetRobot is running right now. You are taking a much bigger risk of getting scammed before you get your money back by going to a new bot then sticking with one that has proven to have devoted devs behind it.
Maybe 0.05 is too much for you but I invested 0.15. Your personal preference is not what this is about, it's about general common sense and logical reasoning behind making a choice of which bot you should invest in and it's also an opportunity for me to show people that you are doing everything possible to get people to click your referral link while I actually are giving the bot a documented test with honest reports about what is happening to the bot.
Yes, if you invest in BetRobot and it closed soon after then you'd lose your money, that's pretty straight forward and exactly the same applies to EVERY bot out there so your arguments seem quite weak.

If the bot "did work" or "is working" is not a matter of opinion, is it?
I think it is pretty obvious that GlobalCryptoBot is purely a scam and that every BTC that you put in to it will be gone before you get a chance to even get 50% back. I am completely certain that the bot will close down very soon. I just know it and I know that for a fact as well as you know for a fact that BetRobot did scam people and soon will again. Do you get my drift?
You might not want to make an investment based on hope/luck, going for a bit more fact based desicion is the better choice. That is what my blog is all about.
I suggest that nobody just instantly takes faith in random bots just because they are new. There will be loads and loads of fake bots to come and the smartest move would be to pick one that has proven itself.
Anybody can make a bot, both you and me could do it today. Wanna start the "NoScamMoneyMakerT5000" bot tonight and reap some BTC before everybody does it so that no bot no longer can be trusted unless they have been running for a few months? That is my prediction of this type of service, in the end it will be the longer running and proven bots that people will pick. Or maybe that is what GlobalCryptoBot is. What are the probabilities? :)

Day 3 update has been made.

It's probably the same reason like the last few times it was down for a few hours. They are testing out their new attempt of resetting the 30 days duration of the investments. Good thing you managed to use a "maybe" this time to prove that you are guessing.

Why are you saying that I don't know a lot about that site? That is incorrect.
Let's think twice about this amount of earnings you're mentioning. Would it be less suspicious if you were able to earn lots of money without investing anything? I think that what isn't right here is your track of thought. You won't earn loads of BTC without investing, so, that is exactly what IS right about this. No investments and relatively small earnings, makes sense, no?
I definitely aren't gonna spend money on a website that promotes this. The WP blog is enough.
The comment is not removed, you'll see everything commented here: 
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:02:42
No, I don't know why you can't see the comment but I can. [screenshot]( and thats an imgur link, you can trust that site at least I hope.
Why am I doing this you ask. Well, I just want to see if it works. I want to know how much can be earned this way and for how many people. It was just an idea I had and so I made it happen. If you can't trust it, aren't interested in following the progression of it or simply think I'm a scammer then you are free to avoid joining. I will not force you or try to convince you, but if you make people believe that this purely is a scam then you are just here to ruin my experiment so please ask me the right questions instead of trying to blame me and I'll answer you as well as I can.
I spend time doing this because I think its fun too. Just having people read my blog is nice, I use YouTube for the same reason. I posted some video because it's cool when people watch them, not to earn money.
Who knows, it might be a total failure but giving it a try is worth it.

You will be our first new team member. Welcome :)

I don't have 4 bitcoins. I have 0.00025740 BTC so far. If we get enough players I think we'll eventually get those 4 BTC though, but not very soon. I'm not asking for anybody to invest any money in anything, only their time, and with it we all can earn some BTC. Read the blog to learn how.

what would the catch be?
