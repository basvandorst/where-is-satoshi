Taking out physical cash from your own bank and depositing them into a "cryptocurrency ATM" like the one in OP is one way of depositing cryptocurrency into a wallet without it being traceable back to you. If you avoid cameras and so on, that is.

Can you recommend any? And am I correct in assuming you can track it without "connecting" the app to the actual wallet, but instead just tracking the public ledger?

Alright, thanks!

What is a good tool for tracking the economy of ones investment? Like say I have a wallet and I buy some bitcoins today. I might add some more another day and so on. Is there a tool that will look at date of transfer of btc and current price of btc and so on, and show how much you've gained/lost?

I see that some portfolio apps have the ability for tracking via just adding transaction id or entering things manually, whereas others have the ability to track portfolio via wallet addresses.
What are the pros and cons?

Alright, thanks!

Sure, I wouldn't be able to tell. But is it maybe able to be explained?

Thanks for the explanation! Just a quick question. Is it correctly understood that you don't have the app show you increase/decrease of a currency relative to your portfolio but just the absolute increase/decrease and you then just measure what it means for your portfolio yourself?

I have been using Delta for tracking exchanges, but didn't really understand how tracking ones portfolio worked. I do now, however!
@_date: 2018-08-18 11:57:53
What's the reasoning behind this, if I may ask?

Alright, thanks!
