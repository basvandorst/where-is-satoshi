I find all the Gox-specific outrage pretty hard to square with this statement from Gavin Andresen (in a story entitled **"Bitcoin software fix to take another week"** from the WSJ reprinted in "The Australian" on Feb 17th -  ): 
"It will take two or three days to write the code and longer than that to test it and convince ourselves that we didn’t break something else," said Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade organisation representing bitcoin-related businesses. Mr. Andresen is head of the five-member team of programmers attempting to fix the problem.
and  
“One of the real challenges is getting work done when there is a lot of noise,” said Mr. Andresen, who described a barrage of requests that flooded last week, after news of the attack emerged, from anxious merchant payment processors, brokers and digital wallet providers. “There is a real danger of trying to do too many things at once or doing things sloppily. And that is probably the biggest challenge: to try to balance being focused but also listen to what everyone is saying, making suggestions, making complaints, accusations.”
Odd that so much of the histrionics is directed **solely** at MtGox and Karpeles. People talking their own book, perhaps?
As I've made clear - the existence of the massive premium between BTC and goxBTC resulted in me buying a bunch of 'synthetic' goxBTC over the weekend (using Plus500, who have now stopped permitting new entries in that instrument - otherwise I would buy more). 
In the event that MtGox re-establishes operations, goxBTC and 'other' BTC will re-equilibrate (at a price 100% higher than goxBTC is now) - the only risk is default risk on MtGox itself, and I can't find a single thing that leads me to believe that MtGox' demise is imminent... apart from all the sound and fury from hysterical nuffnuffs (doubtless those who were lured like moths to a flame at prices way above current).
EDIT: LBNL - I don't give a flying rat's arse whether Karpeles or MtGox lives or dies: all I care about is the fact that if goxBTC gets above $380 I'll make half a year's average wages (my average entry is $312)... if it goes to zero I'm out a couple grand. 
More interestingly, if MtGox kisses the dirt, my synthetic position probably even results in an actual claim over any BTC recovered (from MtGox or Karpeles) - but the legal costs of recovery would far exceed the value: far better to spend potential legal costs on having anyone responsible beaten to death.

Thanks, man - I didn't want to come across as a formatting-douche, but the questions you raised (and the conclusion you draw - that something seems "off") were spot-on.

Personally, I could give a fuck if he drinks Starbucks or is fat - and I could give a fuck if he "updates" the Faithful every five minutes. (I admit, the lack of updates is apt to get folks a mite tetchy). The important thing is that - like a duck - the apparent 'ease' conceals mad effort under the waterline.
I would vastly  prefer - for the sake of all the poor fuckers who have cash&amp;coins tied up in MtGox - that he and his crew are madly trying to **get some shit done that moves the ball** rather than issuing press releases that calm the nerves of folks who are on edge and are clucking wildly like a bunch of upset barnyard hens. 
Better to be an unpopular douche who's trying to fix shit, than to "feed the chooks" and lose valuable time... and end up being unpopular anyhow.

Folks keep talking about "withdrawals" as if they're referring to the proceeds of sales of BTC; didn't MtGox say that there were no issues with that sort of thing (except for folks whose USD balances were seized by the DoJ)?
Has anyone here   
(a) had a EUR, JPY, AUD or other non-USD balance;  
(b) attempted to withdraw it (NOT transfer BTC to some other provider); and   
(c) had the transaction refused?
I'm not saying that hasn't happened, but I'm genuinely curious: after all, the MtGox press release on the weekend stated categorically that fiat withdrawals, and transfers between Mtgox BTC balances, were not affected.
Disclosure: I have a "synthetic" long position in MtGox-valued BTC, entered over the weekend and today (average price $312)... basically, assuming the the crowd has got their heads up their chocolate starfish as usual, and that at some point in the next day or so GoxBTC will trade above $380.

Seriously - you think that what was said by the "friend" *made sense*? Jesus wept.
Here's the thing: the government of Zimbabwe (and all other governments) don't "make good" on their currency. The "Department of Finance" jobber was conflating government DEBT instruments (bonds) with **currency** - which doesn't surprise me, given the second-raters who end up at Finance.
Think about it harder: 
If you accepted a $Zim $100 note as payment in 2004, and in 2008 wanted to exchange the note for goods or services that had the same value in 2004, you would be shit outta luck... and the Zim government would not make up the difference in purchasing power. It would not "make good".
So **that** bit was horseshit, and you were unable to spot it.
The only sense in which the Zim government could be said to "make good" is that if you had a trillion dollar tax debt, you could extinguish it with a Zim $trillion note - but it would be cold comfort next to the .gov-generated collapse in the purchasing power of all nominal balances.
The sole reason that governments **recently** asserted a monopoly over the issuance of money, is that it enabled their cronies to bilk the tax-base for 'seignorage' - which can not occur with private money.
Secondly, **part** of .gov money's moneyness, is that it must be accepted by the government as payment for .gov bills (rates, taxation etc) - the "legal tender" laws. However in a world of near-instant fiat convertibility, that aspect is a dead letter: you could not tender BTC as payment of a tax debt, but you could convert BTC to fiat with little or no lag, and submit that.

Interestingly, some guy elsewhere on Reddit says that his (fiat, JPY) withdrawals have been processed.

"I know of no" !== "Gox has no". 
"I know of no deals" is a statement about the limits of an twobitidiot's knowledge; "gox has no buyers" is some fucktard's interpretation that this implies the complete absence of something about which the twobitidiot is in no position to make declarative statements.
Statements of "belief" belong to the fucknards who infest society through religion.
Disclosure: I've got nothing tied up in gox (I exited a synthetic goxBTC position on the bounce on Feb 23rd: I wanted $380 as an exit, but was happy enough at $320). 
The gigantic retarded circle-jerk where someone's "beliefs" or speculations or suppositions or "shit I just ripped out of my ass" are repeated elsewhere as if they're facts, makes the entire BTC community look like a bunch of gullible retard teenagers.

In the ordinary course of events, yes - on Plus500 and other CFD brokers. But Plus500 has intermittently stopped furnishing access to new trades in GoxBTC (otherwise I would be buying a bunch more: current price action looks like weak hands throwing money into strong hands - as always happens near market extremes).
Also, BitFinEx allows leveraged ~~shorts~~ positions (short and long).

Apparently someone from blockchain replied on Twitter, saying that the impending announcement is to do with how they will be handling security going forward - nothing to do with MtGox. 
I'll find the thread where it's mentioned and update this comment.

Two things: working for the Department of Finance is hardly an indicator of economic prowess - the "prestige" destinations for Economics graduates are Treasury and the Reserve Bank. In my year, the kiddies who finished 8th-14th in the Honours year went to one of those two...  from memory **none** of them got a First. Those of us who got Firsts went on to graduate study on scholarships - in my case, having rejected an offer from the Reserve Bank. Nobody - but **nobody** went to Finance, and nobody wanted to (this was from the top-ranked Econometrics department in the country at the time - or maybe equal with ANU).
Second, "working for" Finance could mean just about anything from admin clerk to undersecretary. 
As an example: after 10 years as a senior Defence bureaucrat, my sister was tapped to be a Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister (she advised on Defence Procurement). If anyone asked for her opinion on the merits or otherwise of, say, the avionics on an F35, I would hope she would preface her answer with "I have no real idea, but...".
As for me: I graduated summa cum laude (i.e., First Class honours, GPA 4.0), was awarded a Reserve Bank cadetship (which I rejected), got straight firsts at Masters, unfinished PhD in the formation of expectations in financial markets. I got an HD for Monetary Theory, and **I** understand why Bitcoin has "moneyness". 
Anyone who purports to have training in economics to any significant level, but claims they don't understand bitcoin's moneyness (or claims that bitcoin doesn't have moneyness), is a halfwitted essay-writer (I fucking **detest** "economists" who have no quant skills).

I know, right?
This is why idjits can't have nice things... there are people who are so retarded that they actually think that the Gox folks *inadvertently* left this silly "acq" 'Easter Egg'... which appeared several hours after someone posted the HTML for the MtGox home page, showing a **completely empty** &lt;body&gt; tag.

In other news: it's not possible to make money by entering 600 dump-trucks in the Daytona500 (or even the Paris-Dakar).
And in sport: trying to win the Tour de France on a child's tricycle is probably not a good idea. And it's over to Ollie for the weather.

They would not need to return BTC to those who had sold, though... 
I made exactly this point the other day: that if I was the CEO of MtGox, I would have been greenshoe-ing the market - sitting underneath the bid, buying goxBTC on plunges and simultaneously shorting non-gox BTC elsewhere (with leverage).
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:55:47
LOL ... how can you think that it's fake? 
Companies *always* write shit like **"The reality is that [we] can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserve[s] to as a company."** Wasn't that in every Goldman Sachs 10-K since *ever*?
I mean seriously - anyone who fell for this really *is* **retarded** in the non-4chan sense of the word.
As to the blank homepage - now *that* strikes me as interesting, given that the /www/ directory of their webserver has fuck-all to do with the interstices of the actual operational side of things.
This smells like a reasonably well-crafted op: circulate this appallingly amateurish piece of shit, then 'confirm' one of the details by fucking up the webserver (that's easier to do than interfering with directories outside /www/).

Most of what you said makes sense, but consider this: folks with cash supposedly in "customer segregated accounts" at Refco and MF Global, and positions based on those accounts, got zero when those two brokerages went toes-up.
When you send value to a custodian, you're effectively taking a bet on the custodian - and you're implicitly assuming that their risk of default is zero. (This is why folks should always use custodian-supplied leverage if possible).

Markets for (ahem) "taking matters into one's own hands" tend to concentrate on mechanisms by which the intended target is not around to identify the perpetrator/s.
It's always been the case that getting someone "shown the red card" costs 1/10th of the price of an abduction: abductions have vastly more embedded risk for the folks that do the abducting. 
In fact, it costs more to have someone beaten to the point where they need to be hospitalised, than it costs to have someone knocked... even "mindless thugs" are risk-averse.
If the target lives in the US, you can pay $50 to have him "SWATted": someone makes a fake - but realistic - 911 call that appears to come from the target's residence: hilarity ensues.

That's my guess as well - in which case goxBTC represents a massive arb opportunity.
That's is why I'm long goxBTC [synthetically]... I am always ready to take the opposite side of the crowded trade at a market extreme - because that's when the uninitiated do really *really* stupid things (e.g., dump into a deeply deeply oversold market).
This is like BP.L at 300p after the Deepwater Horizon incident, or QBE.AX after its recent poor earnings guidance. Lemmings hurling themselves over a cliff based on nothing other than what they read on comment threads.
Speaking of comment threads... in re my questions (a)-(c) above, I found a thread last night in which MtGox clients with JPY balances were discussing their withdrawals (conversions to fiat). They are being processed, albeit with significant lags. See here - 
An apparently well-informed (and non-histrionic) poster in that thread indicates that the withdrawal-to-JPY processing delays might well be due to a combination of  
  
(1) the arcane administrative nonsense required by the Japanese banking regulators (the Japanese clearing system - Zengin as opposed to SWIFT or SEPA - is apparently also hopeless);  
(2) a lack of JPY cash balances in MtGox's own account (since most folks do not fund their account in JPY) and administrative delays in converting non-JPY balances to JPY.
All in all, it was quite an informative thread - especially the posts by "solex" and "cryptog1", who seem to know what they're on about.

You should **start** with "This is my theory" (or "This is what I just made up") rather that spewing all that nonsense declaratively and then informing the reader that you pulled it out of your ass in the second-last sentence. Seriously.

Something is definitely brewing though - BTC on other exchanges have wiped out almost all of the deep losses they were showing five or six hours ago.

"What bugs me is that almost all of the media is hanging most of their reporting on this document."
What this episode shows - as clearly as is possible - is that "major" media outlets have absolutely no comparative advantage when it comes to their sources: they simply pull stories out of their collective asses based on the same set of rumour and innuendo that are the basis of the wild-eyed froth of the forum-screechers.
That has been my working hypothesis since the mid-90s (the first time I became aware of just how shallow the media's understanding of any complex subject, is).
Anyone who is an expert on pretty much anything (for me it's economics, in particular economic modelling and QF) generally leaves their first interaction with the "main line" media, thinking "Holy fuck... if they're this incompetent on the shit that I know about, they're likely to be equally awful in all other areas of expertise".
Here's a recipe for reducing surprise and disappointment: act as if the journalistic media as part of the **entertainment** industry, not the **information** industry.

People can **already** get their money out (it seems) but it's a slow process **primarily because of USGov interference with some USD-denominated accounts**.
On this page -  - you can see that there are withdrawals being processed; those charts get their data straight from the MtGox API and thus are not filtered through the strident and frantic Doomsday speculations being bandied about by hysterical comment-threaders.
By all means, take the opposite side of the trade to folks like me... but bear this in mind: the probability that my trading record was generated by luck alone, is 8x10^-32 (114 out of my last 116 trades have been winners; one was a $2 loss; and one was a scratch - I'm more than happy to furnish verified runsheets from my broker to attest to that).

Kinda bizarre - and obviously quite deliberately "left" there (because it wasn't there a few hours ago).
What possible objective does it serve, given that MtGox is not trading? If GoxBTC was trading, then such a move might serve to give a short-term pump - in the same vein as the blue-sky announcements that used to happen in dotcom stocks in the post-bubble *degringolade* in the early Naughties.
Anyhow... someone's having a game.
I hope they have made sure that they squared away the various black-leather-coat wearing Russians that made significant use of BTC (and Gox in particular): them niggas don't play.
