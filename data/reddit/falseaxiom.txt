ELI5 please?
I use coinbase for it's convenience and (at least partial) FDIC backing. I want my money safe, I'd like to be able to see how much dollar value I currently hold without having to make a separate spreadsheet, and I want to have easy trading access - preferably across currencies if I'm going to change.
I want to help, I kind of understand segwit and LN, but not all that well, and I don't want to lose my money by accidentally typing a digit incorrectly. What do I do?

Why do you think I asked the question exactly? Do you think it could be that I want to get off of coinbase and get to a wallet that I prefer?
Try to help next time, for the sake of bitcoin.

What's with the tone? Do you want the average joe to join in on the bitcoin idealogy? Or do you want to watch your precious coin plateau and eventually fall? You get to choose one of the two. If you want the former, inform people on what to do and why they should do it. Don't just berate people.
I understand that coinbase isn't safe, I understand that nicehash, mtgox, bittrex, etc. aren't/weren't safe. What I wanted to know is not that it's not safe... it's what IS safe? Everything seems to get hacked eventually in the crypto environment.
Further, I want to move to a wallet or marketplace that allows trade across coins, this has nothing to do with my currently being on coinbase. If I'm going to move my coin, and incur fees in doing so, I want the move to be an informed one and I want the features I desire, segwit included but it would not be the exclusive reason for my move.
I'll forgive your last point. That was unnecessary. There is risk involved thats not present in fiat transactions, and that same risk doesn't present itself if I don't move; a different risk -coinbase's clear greed - does however. I just want a safety net.
Try to help people next time, for the sake of bitcoin.

That's very presumptuous of you. Can you support that claim?

Did you tell her that you would take her immediately to Japan if it hits 20k, or did you say if it hits 20k, you'll take her (without a designated date)?
Also, If it hits 20k soon, I hope she'd understand that you don't want to sell yet due to the prospective giant sum of wealth you could have in the future.

It's still taking it out of context. She could be trying to relate to her skeptical viewership. 
Are we confident that the people at Bloomberg hate bitcoin or have some reason to deter people from buying it? 
You seem to be implying malice when stupidity could explain it just as easily. Seems like a Hanlon's razor type of thing to me.

I mean... She's asking a question. Maybe she's trying to help people that are new to the concept understand. We didn't get the dude's answer, so this video is entirely out of context.
