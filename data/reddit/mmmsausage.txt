Just lots of time and patience is all that's needed. I designed these over 2 months, I tried to do a little bit everyday (even if it just meant looking things over and evaluating what looked good or bad). Its easier to avoid tunnel vision that way, for me at least designing over a long period of time gives me a better critical eye when it comes to making adjustments. I think if I gave it another two months I could make it look even better (particularly with the line weights, which probably need altering a bit to give more of a consistent and unified feel to the overall set)

What do I actually need to do register the work under a license like this? I added some code from one of your links to my websites post but surely I need to do something else?
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:33:11
I was considering adapting it for some of the other bigger coins if the interest was high enough. Did you have anything in particular in mind?

Its mainly for web designers/devs (or general online stores or blogs etc) who need icons to go with their copy for any bitcoin related websites they are creating or own, but it can be used for anything really.

I will add a version later when I'm done with my work for the day.
edit: I updated the file and included 2 different versions which use orange in the main download

its next on my list and should be done sometime in the next week or so
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:15:46
Interesting, I will add it to my list of things to do.

awesome, thanks for sharing

well its really made specifically for illustrator, I would be surprised if you get it to work in paint. There are some free programs out there that may work with it like gimp (though I think that's more of a Photoshop replacement, not sure how it deals with vectors). Or you could always just download illustrator from somewhere...

The resold in any capacity point is just to stop people from reselling the icons on sites like graphic river. They are meant to be free and nobody should be forced to pay for them in any way shape or form. I would assume putting something in the public domain backs this up if anything. As for not being allowed for use in logos, that was simply put there to stop any future copyright issues with icons being used and then becoming synonymous with a certain brand (unlikely to happen but whatever). You are probably right in that there are some conflictions (and I really don't know enough about the legal stuff with this) but as long as people don't take the piss with it I really don't care.

If only I had 141 bitcoins, I don't where you're getting that figure from but the account linked has roughly .5 of a btc in it
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:50:32
Sounds good, do whatever you want with them
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:04:37
 uploaded a pdf version [here](
@_date: 2014-03-14 00:14:47
Thanks for taking the time to set this up, I appreciate it, but I would rather make everything completely free and just allow donations/tips for anyone that wants to help out.

thanks for sharing
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:43:17
thanks for doing that

Hi, I have spent the last couple of months designing a set of 56 bitcoin related icons that I’m giving away for free.
 
You can download the adobe AI file by visiting this [LINK]( They come in two styles (black, white and yellow plus a plain black). You can also view them via my website at  . 
If you want to support me you can donate me some free lunch money at my bitcoin address:
Depending on how popular they are I will keep on designing some free bitcoin related resources so let me know if they come in any use to you.  Also, if you have any suggestions for things you would like to see designed, leave me a message and I will see what I can do when I have some free time available.
If you have any questions or issues with the .ai file then just let me know and I will try to help best I can.
Tldr: free stuff
Update: I added 2 more color styles to the ai file as per request and have also uploaded a pdf version of the file which can be downloaded [here]( Also, thanks to everyone who has tipped me/donated, very much appreciated.
