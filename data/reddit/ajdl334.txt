No, I understand. I have another question. If they were to chage all their pesos for the amount of bitcoins what help will that do with the prices of their items? They would have to wait for Bitcoin prices to go up to see any benefits no?

How the hell will they even buy bitcoins? If the price is equivalent to a USD...there's no way.

Bro, ads. You are comparing Circle to the biggest sites in the world. Everybody on Reddit uses Google, most people with internet use Facebook, Skype, Twitter, etc. Sorry to say, Circle's business model will not work out like these social sites.

It might smoke out the real Satoshi, that's why she probably did it even if she was wrong.

Definitely not worth it, but probably her stupid ass idea.

Can confirm, healthcare is just as evil. 
It's all evil if you put it in a matter of business. They are looking for profit, not a win in morality. I work in a non-profit now though, it's not as bad.

Bitcoin is a great get rich quick scheme. Just wait till these guys pump more money in an immature commodity and change it out for us dollars. Huge profit. At least until the bubble burst.

Github makes it really easy to code with multiple people. Any repository really.
