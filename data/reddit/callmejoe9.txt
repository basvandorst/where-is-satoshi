will this re-download the entire blockchain again or recognize the data i have already?

looks like fees of $14. but you have to kind of back into that to figure it out in exodus.  i looked at changelyy and their BTC network fees are like $9.  while it looks like BTC network fees are in the $4 range.

localBitcoins, but that was a pain to transact and big markups, so just went with coinbase after that.

i thought i accomplished that when the bitcoin-qt start up dialog box popped up to ask me to set the default data location.  i entered in the new external hard drive that has the copied blockchain data.

right. i guess 10 years ago it was hard to find transactions.  complete opposite from today.

i decided to run a full node on my raspberry pi and splurged for a 500GB microSD card for it. probably wont last as long as i think.  good thing samsung just came out with a 1TB microSD card. unbelievable
