People make it obvious when they sell and when they buy on here.

The goal is to end up with more BTC. People are losing hope in ALTS. Bullish for ALTS in my opinion. I don’t consider every altcoin a shitcoin but most are trash. Bitcoin will always be king but if I can get more by investing; i will.

Don’t you still need to provide ID when you use ATMs?

Never had a problem myself. Been using them since they introduced BTC and a bit before that.

I’ve never owned a stock in my life (I’m relatively young).  But do own some crypto ���� I would support Bitcoin regardless of the price.

I use a segwit enabled wallet ����

This needs more attention...

You’re an idiot mate.

Completely agree on your points. I still find it crazy how my father was able to see all of this happening 10 years in advance. He was well off as retired lawyer at the time we left to the United States, he didn’t have to leave everything behind. He literally sold everything he owned and said, “we are out”. I could be dead for all I know if we all stayed.

I’m from Venezuela, I left the country about 12 years ago. The country literally flipped upside down within less than 10 years. The citizens are the ones suffering the most. Hyperinflation was a big factor into what got me into cryptocurrencies.

Reading this made me a little sad. Ten years ago when I left Venezuela. 2,000 Bolívares or less was about $1. The inflation is beyond insane.

It just “crashed” back up? LOL
@_date: 2019-06-14 07:35:13
Yeah, very good question. Overall I’m not liking this, but can’t say I didn’t see it coming.
@_date: 2019-06-14 07:18:36
Damn, I can’t wait to see this feature.
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:13:52
This website is pure shit.

Calm down.

Try the cash app to buy and withdraw BTC. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:16:59
Very good point. A point that can be brushed off easily by just reading headlines. I want Coinbase to have competition though. Cash app is nice. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:38:26
Pretty much everyone should stay very far away from it.

Great post buddy, so crypto-friendly.
