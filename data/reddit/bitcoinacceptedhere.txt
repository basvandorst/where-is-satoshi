Thanks. We'll be in touch. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:48:36
Good looking site! 
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:24:57
Who is taking the lead of this project? Any way to contact them? 
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:27:35
* Merchant is *always ready* to accept bitcoin (i.e. consumers can pay with bitcoin unannounced, without special arrangement)
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:57:30
Not exactly. There will be many open source tools for the community and free access to data 
Feel free to PM me if you'd like to be part of the beta testing. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:46:33
Good questions/comments. The problem at hand is one of functionality. We're simply trying to build a toolset that allows people greater flexibility and usability. 
Coinmap (built on OSM) is a great project. It has limitations. Coinmap itself can benefit from our project as well. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:28:49
* Merchant offers *discount* for bitcoin-paying consumers

Hi there. Glad to see your post. I've been working on a similar project for a few months now, with design specifications that are similar to yours. 
Our approach is to focus on the searchabilty of businesses/individuals/merchants/organizations accepting bitcoin. That seems to be what is primarily missing from the existing projects/sites. 
So far the code is not open source. We plan on making at least some part of it open source, potentially completely open source if we can monetize through implementation of an accompanying distributed autonomous organization. 
I think your budget may be a bit low to spin out the quality of project you may be looking for. I've personally already put more into my project than the 15 BTC potential bounty, and we've got a lot of development left. 
It would be great to join forces with you.  Teaming up with the Israeli community would be a great opportunity to develop and test the international features we plan to implement. 
One of the motivations for our project was seeing all of the little communities worldwide who were listing local merchant directories. We wanted to develop an engine that could assist (but not replace) their efforts. 
I'm mostly an observer on this account (bitcoinacceptedhere), but I'm on daily. I use this account to upvote and star news where merchants announce they are accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:41:15
It's trivially easy to accept bitcoin. Just post an address and a "bitcoin accepted here" logo. 
The only trick is how much you can market that you are accepting bitcoin. 
Start accepting and see what happens. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 20:07:29
If you have a list of local merchants (name, URL and/or address) we can help you organize and present them to your web page viewers (basically enhance your merchants page). 
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:39:44
Sweet!  It won't be our last tip for sure. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:50:50
That's unfortunate indeed. Why restrict it? 
The problem of finding merchants who accept bitcoin is something I have been working on. Have a pretty exciting solution coming out in beta in the next few weeks.  
@_date: 2014-05-09 03:29:38
Sweet move! Is there a bitcoin club on campus? 
@_date: 2014-05-22 13:35:28
Good to see bitcoin progress in Estonia. 
Are there any Estonian-based websites that list merchants who accept bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:02:28
Not formally. It's a separate project. Coinmap focuses on brick and mortar merchants by it's very nature. It's tied to the map. What we're going to be offering is much more flexible and customizable searches. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 04:41:10
Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:48:28
Great one. 1000 bits
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:24:14
* Merchant *displays* "Bitcoin Accepted Here" (or similar) on their building or website.
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:53:51
Tl;dr: Coinmap is awesome because it has a large repository of data, but much of the data has grown out of date and it's difficult to moderate and edit. Open Street Maps is partly to blame. What are the other solutions out there? 
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:23:35
Right on. We'll add you to our database so potential customers can find you. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:40:42
I'm not local to the area, although I have walked around campus - nice place. I'm in Utah. 
I think a good place to start would be right there at the frat. I'm building a tool that will help local communities find places that accept bitcoin.  We can give you the tool once we're finished. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:06:00
Excellent point. Stay tuned for a product we will giving away in the next month or two. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 17:53:55
Your website looks great!  We should connect sometime.  I think there are potential synergies between our projects. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:21:46
Thank you. Let's keep in contact. I'll PM you. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:38:24
Yes.  Thanks.  Fixed now. 500 bits @_date: 2014-05-27 16:32:27
* Merchant *offers to pay employees in bitcoin*, proven by some sort of press release, public blog post, or similar.
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:45:10
This challenge will be in the rear view mirror shortly :) we're developing the solution to this very issue. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 05:08:56
Are there any local community web pages/organizations that list the local bitcoin-accepting merchants in Singapore? 
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:10:49
This will likely (eventually) be a feature of our upcoming product.   You will be able to search and filter merchants (who accept bitcoin) by this tag and others. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:41:32
Good to hear back from you. I will try to contact you over Skype in the next couple days.  I'd like my lead developer on the call with us so I need to check his schedule. 
The down voting is potentially coming from down-voting bots that have infiltrated Reddit recently.  You'll notice comments get down-voted immediately after posting. Reddit mods are looking into it. Of course that doesn't explain why I'm not getting up-voted, but I wouldn't expect to with my long drawn out reply. 
We'll be in touch. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:22:30


We have a functional alpha (with limited database) but it's not released anywhere yet. 


We're focussing on the back end engine (and APIs) currently. Front ends will vary but we've also got a very basic front end as well, designed to accommodate web and mobile interface. Haven't seriously considered Wordpress, haven't ruled it out completely either though. 


Yep. We're on the same page there. 
(ps I'm not sure how to do the quoting that's indented) 
@_date: 2014-05-11 08:02:51
Looking forward to seeing your progress! Looks great so far. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:55:47
Next to Airbitz, this is the best alternative to coinmap out there, in our opinion. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:55:22
Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-04-30 06:08:04
I approve of this message
@_date: 2014-05-04 17:33:20
We can help. PM me. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:04:59
These issues are about to be solved by a tool we are developing for the community. 
I'm meeting with my lead developer tomorrow. We will be discussing the beta release, scheduled for later this week or possibly next week. 
Beta will initially be closed for testing purposes. Please let us know if you are interested in participating as a tester. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:13:12
Nailed it. 250 bits
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:54:19
Excellent!  Now you just need a bitcoin logo at the bottom of you page(s) to go along with the legacy payment forms. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 08:51:36
Congratulations! That sounds like a very exciting and promising venture. 500 bits. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:35:58
Done. Thanks for the reference! 1000 bits (not sure if that will work, on AlienBlue and have never tipped before). 
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:00:00
Does this merchant have a website? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:38:45
Worked perfect. Thank you, friend. We'll pay it forward. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:42:34
Good observations OP. We're very close to offering an alternative solution that will address the user friendliness issues you raised. Stay tuned. 
We've been marking posts where someone is accepting bitcoin or someone has been looking for an alternative and we'll post a link when it's ready. 
Happy to answer any questions you might have about the end product and what you can expect. Even more happy to get your input as to what the community would like to see in it. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:43:57
^ This is the best solution out there right now in our estimation. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:13:56
Of course, if this is the merchant's business
@_date: 2014-05-03 14:13:02
Thanks for the correction (we probably don't care to watch them all eat lunch), and for adding the link. 
I agree about James. He's one of my favorites, does a great job explaining bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 19:31:27
Yes. Funded from my own personal bitcoin investment profits. 
I'm trying to do my part to make bitcoin both a store of value and a medium of exchange. To be valuable bitcoin needs both. 
My contribution is to create a search engine to help local communities connect bitcoiners and merchants accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:40:28
Bits accepted here!  They will go towards our Bitcoin project.  :)
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:09:32
Great news. We'll put you in our database and get traffic directed your way as soon as we can. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:34:37
* Merchant offers *escrow service* or return policy for large ticket items (if applicable)
@_date: 2014-05-11 03:50:00
Good enough. Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:55:10
I would definitely like tipping to be a part of the service. Maybe someone can help us integrate that aspect?
