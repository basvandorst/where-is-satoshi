No seriously what time is going to be announced. I’m just trading 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:09:19
What time is the official announcement??
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:56:35
I know that but they want to control another stock on the stock market and will take this one with its small amount of outstanding shares. They are always looking for ways to make more money...
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:20:31
They hold roughly 172,000 coins. GBTC is awesome for 401k/IRA to avoid capital gains tax.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:50:13
That is because the Premium is so high. It needs to drop more. $1200 for GBTC would be fair
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:23:14
Investors can buy GBTC in your 401k that’s the only way right now. It is basically a Bitcoin ETF
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:11:53
Damn I ordered a transfer for LTC 30 hours ago and it never happened. This sucks
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:50:49
GBTC is the best just Hold
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:01:39
I don’t care about the futures. GBTC works great
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:13:33
Lol this was from 7 days ago
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:11:31
America is powerful and they can do whatever they want I guess
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:52:20
All my co workers love it. It can be bought in a Fidelity 401k or IRA. GBTC has the best chance of becoming the first Bitcoin ETF once the SEC accepts one.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:50:10
I appreciate you sharing your story. It is good motivation for us all.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:12:32
My friend and I have been waiting 30 hours for our withdrawal. I hate this exchange
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:59:12
This absurd. There’s no extremely bullish articles on Google pushing this up 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:46:17
Look at all the negative articles on SeekingAlpha and Citron Research/Andrew Left trying to short it. It’s the only Bitcoin stock in the world and it would be powerful to own it and swing the price the way that benefits your firm.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:01:08
They know the risk. Bitcoin will go up in the long-term but we need a pull back first
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:47:44
Amen brotha. GBTC is the best way to multiply your retirement accounts
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:27:56
Realistically a Bitcoin ETF won’t arrive until summer earliest. The SEC commissioner doesn’t want an ETF since Bitcoin is a non-regulated asset. 
GBTC is awesome and not many people know about it! HODL and appreciate the unreal gains 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:12:17
GBTC is awesome. And I’m not paying taxes lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:12:15
GBTC has a monopoly right now and will most likely hold it for 6 more months. It is the only stock you can buy in your 401k and IRA to get exposure to Bitcoin.
The premium is caused because it only has 1.9MM outstanding shares and it’s obvious more than 1.9MM people want exposure to Bitcoin. The Premium can continue to grow because it’s the ONLY Bitcoin investment!
Hold your shares. The Hedge Funds are spreading negativity, so they can buy all your GBTC at a low price to manipulate the stock later!
GBTC TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:49:34
BUY GBTC and Hold in your 401k and IRA
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:42:13
I meant you can buy Bitcoins with your regular check... 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:32:45
It’s really good for your 401k and IRA accounts because it the only pure Bitcoin stock.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:41:03
Yes employers in the SF Bay Area...
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:42:27
Hmm exchange fees aren’t even that much and yes you have to pay capital gains tax if appreciates... it doesn’t seem that great
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:12:21
GBTC is for IRA and 401k accounts that all! We don’t want Hedge Funds to screw up our retirement investment!
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:48:26
Who knows taxes are a pain and most people use their companies 401k which you can’t liquidate until you quit...
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:22:14
Millennials &gt; Generation X and Baby Boomers
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:00:28
It’s not like he would be able to sell each of his coins for $100k
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:02:49
Definitely all my co workers buy GBTC the Bitcoin ETF through Fidelities 401k and IRA
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:44:33
I meant 100% Bitcoin stocks...
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:13:48
I think after all the new investors dump the money in it will hit $12k then fall fast because they don’t know how to Hodl. That will be a buying opportunity 
I think the dip will come from people shorting the new Bitcoin futures and all the fear around that
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:15:49
We are about to have a dip buy all your shares back and more. Buy your Porsche’s in 18 months...
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:57:44
Yeah, but eventually the holders will sell whether that's $100k or $1M.
I'm not expecting anything I'm just speculating that it could happen haha
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:05:06
All my co workers bought it in their Fidelity 401k. The gains are better than Bitcoin. The swings are awesome! The premium doesn't matter because it is the only Bitcoin ETF and Americans use their retirement accounts to buy it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:58:55
Which gives the opportunity to lower/middle class people to obtain huge returns
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:25:45
Buy GBTC through Fidelity IRA or 401k it is the best
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:53:21
If you have a Fidelity 401k you can create a Brokeragelink account inside your 401k to buy GBTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:53:30
Yeah college kids have been buying Bitcoin for a while now. Millennials have benefited extremely well.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:28:22
GBTC is awesome every 10% Bitcoin rises it rises 15%
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:53:56
Take a loan now
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:11:02
GDP= C+I+G+NX
Investing in Bitcoin raises the “I” so the GDP will be fine
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:14:49
GBTC since it increases like 15% for every 10% that BTC does.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:47:42
Yeah hitting 10,000 was the hard part now it will fly up a couple thousand before the dip
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:45:34
That doesn't matter. If a citizen invests into Crypto and makes gains he will Consume more increasing GDP. The government also taxes those gains and uses that tax revenue on Government spending to increase the GDP.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:47:05
I don't know about that. Plenty of people I know making 50-70k in California are investing into it pushing them up social classes.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:21:36
Yeah Fidelity let’s you buy GBTC if you open a Brokeragelink account inside your 401k plan. I wonder if we will see a Bitcoin ETF in 2018 and how they will handle the premium. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:09:52
$10,000 by Monday morning at this rate !!
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:16:55
GBTC since it increases like 15% for every 10% that BTC does
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:54:12
I wouldn’t have lost anything if their website wasn’t broken. I couldn’t access my futures for a week until today...
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:16:11
Prolly fall from 12.5k to 7.5k on news of investor shorting the new bitcoin futures. We will see
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:13:21
It doesn’t track Bitcoin exactly because it has a premium of roughly 30%. A ton of my co workers buy it in their 401k because it’s the only way to exposure to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:01:03
The corrections are usually 40% so maybe 12k down to 7k
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:54:14
Yeah but most of them are Millenials who heard about it in college and bought it with their friends. There's a ton of low and middle class kids in college.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:00:13
Yes that is why I think college kids investing into Crypto will improve the wealth gap.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:07:17
That's nothing compared to the 120% premium back in August. Expect more growth this week.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:40:12
That’s awesome but he could have 5 of those if he held longer
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:22:56
I know that's not the goal I was just speculating if a lot of low/middle class Millenials will become wealthy. but yeah good point haha
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:51:50
No, but average people have the opportunity to invest in something that will generate huge returns. I feel like the rich get all the best investment opportunities such as IPO prices keeping the Gap wide today.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:09:05
Buy GBTC. Fidelity allows you to buy. Most of my co workers hold that to get exposure to Bitcoin. it’s done very well
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:16:44
I can’t find a single link that says that 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:53:05
I understand that, but I wasn’t able to access my Futures for a week. It was a complete rip off.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:20:32
Yeah GBTC is the only way to buy Bitcoin in the stock market. Many people buy it in their retirement accounts 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:03:25
Can you post a link of this new rule. I've never heard of that 6 month rule.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:02:30
Good point, but maybe it will only be used for 10% of transactions making the USD most important.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:41:05
I thought it would become the true bitcoin because large corporations and big money controls this world. Anyways HitBTC ripped off their customers.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:05:08
BCH dividend was for people who held on Nov 6th close. And will be paid out sometime 90 days from then
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:38:18
Yeah you can buy GBTC it tracks Bitcoin pretty closely
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:53:17
I don't care bro. It was just a short term trade. HitBTC scammed me and locked me out from being able to sell my futures before the news hit.
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:28:59
I am. Alt coins are going to fly faster than Bitcoin too ��
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:05:35
It’s a healthy correction. BTC and the crypto markets will be $5 Trillion by the end of the year :)
