So Bcash is as severe as racism?
But 'Cripple Coin', isn't taking the piss out of cripples by using their condition as a pejorative? Wouldn't the SJW's call that 'Ableism' or something?

He sold agricultural grade explosives through ebay, using the postal service and stored them in an apartment block. Not the brightest idea, but I do think his punishment was more severe than it should have been. He wasn't locked away for a violent crime or fraud. I think his actions of late are pretty misleading, bordering fraud though as he tries to push BCash as Core on Bitcoin.com.

I wouldn't expect new comers to use a Nano S, unless their purchase is sizeable. I guess I can only recommend Blockchain.info but they don't use Segwit.

You end up with two totally different coins.
To access both, you will need to import the private key of your wallet into the respective wallets. If you had your coins on a website such as Coinbase, you may not get them straight away (they just came out recently) because they have the private key, and they'll only release it when it lines up with their plans to perform insider trading and rig the market.

Because we lost the cold war (before it began) with central banking. First tenant of communism.

But, communism doesn't work. Ugh, Bitcoin, probably the greatest force to help win the cold war, then this :(.
That money would have been so much better if it was used to teach people in poverty how to provide for themselves, instead of generate and strengthen a reliance on others. Independence, not domestication!

That is not quite right. I thought maybe a mis-type but R. Paul would never advocate the welfare state.
Welfare state + open borders = economic migrants that don't assimilate because they get subsidized.
No welfare state + open borders = people coming over who seek opportunity and sink or swim. Those that swam had to engage in the free market and learn the culture. Those that were stuck in their ways would have a significantly higher chance of failure.
This was tested in the 50's - 60's and worked well. 30% of immigrants left on their own accord after failing. The rest stayed and assimilated brilliantly. I'm not advocating that today though given ISIS. Just pointing out the erroneous conclusion. By all means disagree with R. Paul re open border, I do too, but the combination of ending the welfare state is not disastrous.
HRC's open borders and communist economic would have been national suicide.
Personally, I think open borders at this point in time is a terrible idea given foreign terrorist like ISIS and the evident unholy alliance with domestic terrorists like Antifa and BLM.

Xi could probably still microtrack you. Blockchain is public after all.
BTC is yet to solve Private yet Transparent.
@_date: 2019-11-16 20:35:15
Transparency does not benefit the individual personally. It provides validity to the system itself ensuring there is no double spending. Transparency is definitely a positive attribute of blockchain on a system level.
That is why it is a problem to solve, how to keep the positive attributes of transparency but somehow providing privacy to the individual. Zcash and Monero are coins that have a privacy focus. BTC should at some stage adopt some of those technologies. I believe there was at some stage talks of BTC adopting Zsnarks, but I may have misread that, it was a long time ago.

Yes, I only said "probably" because people that have never interacted their wallet with a service requiring identification would probably still be under the radar.
People that have mined coins or purchased locally, and have either only stored it or only spent it locally as cash are likely not microtrackable.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:34:22
Bitcoin is great, because when cretins ask me to fund things, it is much harder for them to steal it, and I can leave easily.

The reward gets smaller and harder
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:17:02
because without the miners, the transactions don't get confirmed.
Miners need incentive, they chase the most profitable coin.

@_date: 2017-11-12 16:53:55
Miners get rewarded from two streams
1. The fee you pay when you transfer
2. The BTC that gets released through mining.
When all coins are mined, miners will rely on transaction fees only.

BCH got bitch slapped.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:15:47
It was $2500 not long ago, then got slapped down to $1300.
BCH was an openly hostile fork that sought the threaten the crown BTC wears.
After the threat was sent packing, investors poured in because the risk was over. Investors are scared by risk, and attracted when there is none or few. Hence the pile onto bitcoin.
I hope it over piles, and it causes another dip, so I can get more.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:26:14
I didn't panic sell, by the time i noticed I tried to be clever, pulled some BTC into Eth (not into BCH) to try and convert back at the bottom. I missed the mark and only managed to convert back half at the same exchange rate.
Made nothing :(. Hoping BTC drops again so I can convert more. Won't be clever anymore, just HODL.

No, net neutrality is a concept that has been around for a very long time, the internet has thrived without the FCC providing net neutrality oversight. John Oliver did his song and dance and got the internet to all of a sudden forget that it existed without the FCC regulations, but due to the outcry of the naïve, the FCC got backing to regulate the internet. Now there is more scare mongering, it is likely because the FCC wants even more powers to regulate it further.

What he is saying is, they are entitled to compensation to the value of the coin at the time of the hack. The losses are not an asset of speculation. If you lost $1,000 worth in 2013, you should get $1,000 (perhaps with inflation included). Not $10,000 today.

They say having 10% of your portfolio in gold is healthy.
BTC is better than gold. Saying that, if you don't know what you are doing BTC can be risky, so until you are confident you know how to secure it, don't invest what you aren't prepared to lose.

@_date: 2015-02-15 07:45:28
HA, you actually think it was deregulation that caused that?
It was the creation of Freddie and Fannie, and the regulatory pressure to lend money to people that couldn't pay it back. It was the lessened requirement for reserves in conjunction with the promise for a bail out.
Deregulation?! The free market would not reward reckless lending, those risks would not have even been taken.
