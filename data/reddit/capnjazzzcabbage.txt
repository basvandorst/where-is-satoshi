And with democratic styles of government the public votes for who should be in office based on needs of the people and their ideas to solve. With banks it’s whomever they hire that they think will increase their profits the most. Conflicts of interest in my personal opinion. Just like I don’t think medical insurance companies can HONESTLY say that they care and want to provide medical coverage while their CEO’s make 20 million bonuses and deny required treatments. There’s no black/white answer, just a new idea to solving a problem.

Lol sometimes views just differ man. It’s something we all need to understand when discussing any type of politics or economics. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:49:55
What do you mean by “know what they’re doing with your money,” - when bankers caused the last major economic crash in 08’? You can put your BTC on a hard wallet and as long as you have the recovery phase, will always be able to get your BTC back in case the wallet got lost, stolen or broken. Putting it on a hard wallet also makes it impossible to hack, no need for the FDIC. You’re welcome not to use it, but saying it’s pointless just because it’s not working perfectly just isn’t correct.

You’re missing the part in tiny writing - “returns not guaranteed” lol
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:17:17
If you did any research you’d know there is people already working to fix these issues. BTC is supposed to be a decentralized currency, which means you’re avoiding banks on purpose. You’re missing the entire point of BTC and just impatient.

Why in history have most of the major modern societies gone from monarchical and dictatorial leaderships to democratic (not strictly democratic but close to it) forms of government? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:09:37
Dude I have a job and no time for this. I don’t care what you’ve done, I said “and others” who are all the ones sitting here moaning. Here’s a metaphor for you: nobody originally smoked pot for medicinal benefits. Just a bunch of people wanting to get high that eventually found the medicinal benefits. If a bunch of people wanna get rich and eventually learn the purpose of cryptos and transition towards it, it’s a good thing overall. Just because the price is going down doesn’t mean crypto isnt growing overall for its original purpose. I’m not interested in online fighting with someone who clearly doesn’t want to have an open mind or open discussion, so let’s just move on already dude. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:33:17
Lol I think you sound ignorant right now. He’s talking about the fact that 6K is still overall growth from last year for the coin, which is a good thing for the coin itself. Don’t get all emotional because you chose a bad time to invest, that’s the risk with investing and you’re the one that chose to do it. I did too, but I’m capable of being objective and seeing the bigger picture. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:29:18
Edit: I had responses on here but removed them because I’ve got the feeling you’re not going to let this be a calm and decent conversation to discuss ideas and I’m not interested in internet fights that won’t go anywhere. 
Read the Bitcoin white paper and do some more research into it. If you don’t like the idea, you don’t have to participate. It’s one of the great things about having freedom. I would really think the only people that wouldn’t want to see progress are the ones that have something to lose. You a banker?
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:55:42
The big picture of crypto isn’t for you to get rich or investing at all. It’s for decentralization. If a coin that 10 years ago was worth $.10, evens out to $6K, it’s good for the purpose of the coin overall. People that have invested and gotten rich are simply a side effect. That’s why you sound like a moron. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:37:50
As I previously said, it’s main goal is decentralization and putting power in the people’s hands instead of financial institutions. You should look up the BTC White Paper for a better understanding. I really don’t understand the point of your being on a forum of a product you hate as well? You’ve got nothing more important to do? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:57:05
I should clarify it’s not correct in my opinion. We’ll let the future decide. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:00:21
Actually that’s just called a difference of opinion. The reason you and others have probably failed so badly is due to these emotional outbursts. Get some class dude. Internet’s not a good enough reason to lower expectations of yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:49:18
Yeah showing that class I was talking about. I’m done, hope you grow up one day
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:06:57
The volatility is wild, 30 minutes ago they were a little low but stable and then I just check again and all the cryptos I keep up with are double digit negatives 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:04:55
It’s fine if you prefer banks because of their convenience and service, but there’s always a chance they screw it up again. You can read a recent article by Mark Zuckerberg stating that the entire point of internet and technology was for decentralization. If YOU don’t want decentralization, that’s fine, stay with the banks. But there is clearly millions of people that disagree.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:23:37
It also doesn’t mean it’s an impossible fix. Regardless if it’s BTC or any other crypto currency, you’re still ignoring the entire point of cryptos because you’re being impatient. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:42:58
I stopped reading after you keep comparing me to Trump those first couple sentences. Learn to control your emotions dude, you’ll be happier in life and maybe one day we could have a real conversation that makes improvements for people.

Watched an interview the other day discussing the issues that BTC has had with mining speed, etc. and they stated that all the miners had been sold out and even this upcoming Spring’s batch were already sold out of pre-orders. They went on to say BTC is still pretty early in the development stage and that the recent boom brought all of these issues to the spot light due to not having enough people/resources ready for the boom. Is this something you guys agree with? Give em a little time to implement lightning and have more miners and issues should be fixed? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:12:49
Actually, like I said previously, I had to get to work, and am currently at work on lunch checking for news stories. I don’t waste my time arguing. As Neil Degrasse Tyson has stated: “if an argument lasts more than 5 minutes, you’re either both wrong or wasting your time,” - I’ve got better things to do to improve my life than sit on Reddit arguing.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:29:54
So why is cash or gold so valuable? Because you can wipe yourself with cash after taking a dump? Everything in this world has the value we humans give it. BTC is a good idea but they’ve gotta hurry up and fix the issues involving it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:52:37
Might* 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:06:52
That’s what makes it risky. There’s no telling, just keep up with news updates, trends and price fluctuations and try to make your best judgment. The reason BTC can make the profit is the risk involved
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:39:15
Okay, thanks for your response 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:01:28
Grow up

I bought BTC about 6 days ago. It took a couple days to process my bank account, and has now been 3 days since the money left my account and the BTC is still pending with Coinbase. Is this typical? I did originally receive an email I should have it by 12/23, but I figured that’d be the very latest, not the expected date...
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:34:53
BitCash is a direct competitor with BTC on the Coinbase exchange. Ethereum doesn’t really have one yet in the same sense so it’s not going to have the same issues. Alt’s might be on the rise, but they rose the same time BTC rose and haven’t had that next step on their own yet. To say they’re taking over is a bit early at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:31:41
It took my last transaction about 6 days to process, no worries
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:19:39
Ahh okay, I’ve been sitting here thinking I’m late to the party, thanks
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:52:18
All you can do is try and time it correctly. You can wait for BTC to go back up but the alt’s night go back up as well. There’s no crystal ball for these lol
