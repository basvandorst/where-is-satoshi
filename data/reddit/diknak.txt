They are probably right about other cryptos taking over. Most of my coins is in bitcoin, but it is a pioneer and relying on duct tape to keep it together.

I don't see a problem with bcash existing, but calling bitcoin 'bitcoin core' is a sleazy marketing technique that Roger Ver uses.  It would be like starting a movie studio called Disney Cartoons and then when talkin about the real Disney, you call it Disney Core instead.  You don't get to change the name of your competitor to try and bring it down to equal footing.  
Bitcoin Cash is shifty as hell because they are trying to elevate their standing by confusing people.

Can someone explain why bitcoin can't be a bubble? The common reasoning is "because it's not fiat" but that doesn't really answer the question. Bubbles can exist outside of currencies and I don't get how bubbles and being fiat or not are directly connected.

I think the issue is you don't seem to understand the term "use case". Ethereum and Bitcoin have the exact same use case, but have different solutions to the use case.

Lol, nice. 
LN reduced the writes to the blockchain. I'm sorry that you can't grasp how that impacts the network overall. One day you might understand.

It's temporarily unavailable because there is a massive spike in demand for it because it's getting a ton of mainstream attention.
Use the same app, but get Ethereum or Litecoin when it's enabled again. The bitcoin fees are insane right now.  You can convert it to bitcoin for free after that if you want.

You weren't aware that transaction fees were through the roof right now? Most of my coins are bitcoin, but it's going to go downhill fast if this lightning network doesn't happen soon and spread like wildfire.

This is a fucking retarded comment. Insider trading means only a few select people have the info. So the elite get rich off the back of the public.

Bcash would have these problems too if it were as popular. Increasing the block size is a temporary and easy fix.

It's not drama if you read past the headline.  He didn't dump it because he didn't believe in it, but because he wanted to ensure that there wasn't a conflict of interest.

2 weeks ago (12/7), Bitcoin was at $13,000 and now it's at $16,400.  It's not down from two weeks ago, but yes, it has fallen a lot over the last few days because of the sudden changes.  That's why it's volatile...

He briefly mentioned forking, but I'm I correct that he said that when there is a fork your crypto is essentially doubled, duplicated on the new fork?

If bitcoin is a store of value and not good for transactions, then what's the point in having it over alt coins? Alt coins are good at both.

There is nothing wrong with traditional investments.  Bitcoin is not a good investment.  You said it yourself; you should be into it for intellectual curiosity, not for investing.
The existing currencies aren't going to crash into an apocalyptic situation in the foreseeable future, so traditional investments are smart.
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:27:16
No, we don't pay taxes when we pick up a package in the US, so it is very different here.  All of our taxes are paid up front, and you're right, bitcoin doesn't change import tax laws.  
But you are correct, 'free trade' is not the right term since we are talking about currency exchange, not exchange of goods/services.  Regardless, the point still stands.  If you want to wire money internationally, it must be sanctioned by the government.


You don't pay fees, but merchants do.  Merchants adopt credit cards because of customer convenience, but they lose money compared to cash transfers.  No, credit cards are not frictionless.

@_date: 2014-12-19 13:17:58


You are absolutely right.  However, the likelihood of living in an apocalyptic situation is extremely low.  It's a risk analysis and the safer bet is to use traditional methods for investments.  Bitcoin may not go away, but that doesn't mean the value is going to go up.  It is an extremely volatile currency with an unknown future value.  It is a very risky bet to place your chips on bitcoin for your future retirement.  I'll stick with the stock markets that have a 10%+ increase a year on average (including market falls).

PayPal is moving to support Bitcoin, so that is going to cause a huge amount of traction.
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:59:54


That's the point right there.  Currently, the government has to sanction transfer of money.  If I want to wire a money internationally, it has to go through several third parties, may not be permitted by law, and will result in a ton of fees.  The same is not true for Bitcoin.


It's not meaningless and he most certainly didn't make it up.  It basically means little to no fees associated with money transfer.
