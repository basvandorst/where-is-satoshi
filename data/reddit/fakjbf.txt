if you have loans, get out now. at the very least  sell off enough to cover the loans and hodl the rest. you need to view Bitcoin as what it has truly become, a speculation bubble. this is the bubble popping, and no one truly knows where the price will stabilize and what it will do once it has. if things go south and it stabilizes below 10k and there isn’t another wild speculation spike again, that’s not going to end well for you.

So you disagree with capital gains taxes entirely? You realize most CEOs and board members of large corporations get paid in stocks so that they only have to pay capital gains instead of the regular income tax, right? If you got rid of capital gains taxes then most rich people would pay literally nothing in taxes. That’s why there is a lower limit to capital gains, you have to have made over a certain threshold before it starts getting taxed. That is precisely to protect normal everyday investors who are using capital gains to supplement their income, not replace it. So you either need to be OK letting the rich get away with paying nothing, or suck it up and _maybe_ pay a _fraction_ of your capital gains to the government.

While I agree that’s feasible for dogs and cats, what if you want a ferret or lizard? Those are basically impossible to find at an adoption center, so there is an actual need for pet stores to have them.

Yeah when you get down to the nitty gritty the laws gets fuzzy and need some clarification on how much the tax should be and how to document it. But some people seem to think that the very premise of paying taxes for money made in cryptocurrency is in question, which it isn’t. Buying cryptocurrency at one vale and selling it at a higher value is totally analogous to buying and selling stocks, and so should be taxed under capital gains. There is no way around that, profit made from investments counts as income and is taxable by the government.

I bought in for a bit more than I should have at $1100, but when the price hit $1700 I sold off about 2/3rds to get my original investment. Even if Bitcoin completely crashed tomorrow I would be fine, the only thing I’d have lost is the _opportunity_ to make more money. So I’m just going to wait it out and see what happens, if we’re lucky it’ll bounce back and continue to grow steadily.

true, and hoarding coins instead of spending them hurts that dream

Yes you absolutely have, it’s called a crypto_currency_ for a reason. You can buy things directly with Bitcoin and Ethereum and all the others. Even if you haven’t cashed them in for your country’s currency you still have literal money sitting in what is effectively a bank.

Information has energy. Memes are made of information, therefore they have energy. A high enough energy density can create a black hole. Therefore it is ~~theoretically~~ totally possible for Bitcoin memes to spawn a singularity.

Why buy when you can adopt for free? I’ve literally never understood why people spend money on “purebreeds” with tons of health problems when the mutt at the animal shelter just needs some flea remover and will probably be healthy for years to come.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:30:12
That’s any pet though. Tons of dogs from breeders have just as bad if not worse health problems, and if it’s a purebred you can basically be guaranteed shit health unless it’s from a working line.

Was thinking about getting into bitcoin, would you recommend waiting until this has died down?
