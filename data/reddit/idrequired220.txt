That's actually Monero's job now since it's much less tracable.

Seriously. This hype is going to convince a lot of people to invest when the bubble is at its height. The real winners are the hedge funds excited to make that trade.

That's insulting. It's not ridiculous to try and warn people of the serious gamble they are taking by buying Bitcoin.

The idea of getting rich quick is a powerful one. It's basically all we are trained to desire in a capitalist society. Thus is seems unavoidable that situations like this current mania occur. The winners here will always be hedge funds willing to manipulate the markets before dumping their reserves onto the unlucky. The crazy thing is they'll do it again and again in different sectors and nobody is there to stop them.

Yeah honestly I'm pretty doubtful any cryptocurrency is going to succeed for this reason alone. Volatility dissuades people from adopting it as a currency. Yet the only thing that gives these things any value is a functional market for goods and services. Otherwise it just becomes a more complicated pyramid scheme.

Not by guns. In fact it's an interesting story involving the founding of the IMF and a sneaky US economist.
