my most recent purchase was 3 days ago, and before that it was like 5 day ago and before that it was like 9 days ago. I use BTC quite a bit and never had this issues when paying with a debit card.

From my experience that has been the case. I bought $30 using my bank by accident and it said find will be available on the 11th. Right after I bought it with my debit since I needed the BTC ASAP. And it was available right away. Now I am jus hoping on the 11th BTC it up or what I bought it at so I can get most my money back.

$100 is nothing, they will go after people who owe more money before they get to you. hell people dont pay tens of thousands and get away with it.

If you learn how to read it’s not an investment. I think you are a retard. I was paying via bitcoin for a $30 item. Accidentally bought the BTC with my bank not my card creating a 5 day hold. I had to re buy the $30 with my card so I can buy my item. Damn some people are stupid as hell and need every single detail spelled out for them

and? thats not the point or what I was talking about, you are a R E T A R D

I hope so, I bought $30 with with my bank by accident when it was at like 11.9. I have to wait 5 days to get it back so I need to to get to at least 12k lol (I used the bitcoin to buy something not to invest)

Football scores don’t change after the game is over. And if it does it’s rare. Bitcoin changes every minute.

That’s very useless.

yeah its good that it didn't dip, I was surprised, after it got to 13k that fast I was like this fall will not be good.  I was wrong

I invest but I also buy mushroom spores with crypto

I have been using them for over 1 year and never had my funds need to wait 5 days. Only if when I used my bank account did I need to wait 5 days, but they you know that in advanced.

You must have autism if you are this picky about how people talk. If you don’t know what I lost my private key means then you are really fucking stupid. That’s like me saying. I lost my car keys and your like what? Do you mean you lost your key fob? ITS THE SAME DAMN THING. I legitimately think you have some type of mental disorders
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:08:20
You just seem salty that someone on the internet has more money than you lol. I bet if you lost $300 youd be eating raman for months.
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:07:33
lol so Im not aloud to ask a question just becase I can affored to lose $300 and not go broke. wow you have some problems man. maybe answer the question when you make a post. I asked why people say this, like do you have proof of tons of CB accounts being hacked and emptied on the daily?  or anything that would give solid proof that its unsafe? if the risk factor is oh you MIGHT lose it thats just dumb, if its like a known thing that happens daily, weekly or monthly then sure its valid to say that.  if it happend one time thats whatever just do what I do and dont put in more then you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:59:00
Yeah I read all your past posts and comments. You are one of those weird neck beard never leaves the house type of people
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:37:54
how much of a risk is it? I don't hear about people getting their bitcoin stolen from coinbase daily. but at the same time $300 is nothing to me. I spend that on weed every 2-3 days. maybe if it was like 1K+ but id never have that much in bitcoin for more then the time it takes to buy what im buying
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:40:12
Did you not read the post? I LOST THE PRIVATE KEY. Probably somewhere in my old house I moved from over a year ago. The wallet had $5 so I did't care to keep the key in a super safe place. If I want $5 ill just put $5 in BTC
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:11:07
How are you so dumb? When I say I lost the private key. IT MEANS I LOST THE PAPER. HOW ARE YOU THIS FUCKING DUMB!!!!
