The [followup article]( is up now, where they explained what went wrong:


tl;dr  the machine asked for a payment of a undisclosed size called a "miner's fee" that Norm didn't agree to pay.
However while I agree  they didn't read up a lot on the topic, I imagine they were pretty typical of the people who would use a machine like this, ie people who had a small interest in the concept of bitcoins and in a spur of the moment decided to give it a try. Obviously no serious and well-researched bitcoin enthusiasts are going to purchase them using a service with that big of a mark-up and requiring you to give up that much private information. Thus they gave a pretty realistic representation of what experience the average user could expect to have.

To be fair I don't think you should be viewing this as your average Tested  in-depth  "review" or "report". It was simply a off-the-cuff video that documented their experience of using a random Bitcoin ATM and using their bitcoin to  buy a product in the real world.
