A manipulation theory is also the easy explanation. Certainly the expectation was wrong , but what caused the downturn?  A month ago, Bitcoin was close to $10k.  In the last month, Bitcoin did not change its nature. And neither did the Chinese government or the US Fed. I am trying to make sense of the downturn, when I would have suspected the price to be slowly creeping up.

I feel a need to respond. I heard somewhere that a 1000 years from now the United Stares will be remembered for three things:  the Declaration of Independence, Baseball and Jazz Music. Three great things that have improved humanity.

I’d like to clarify: I’m seeking thoughts about Bitcoin 2020, whether it is worth it for the presentations and/or networking opportunities. Anybody attend the previous Bitcoin Conf?

This questioner should not be condemned. He seems to be genuinely asking and so this is our opportunity to explain. I was once like him. Your questions cannot be answered in a simple post. Instead, you should read and understand laissez faire capitalism and its requirements, a feee society and the rule of law. George Reisman’s Capitalism is a great book. Of course so is The Bitcoin Standard. If you honesty approach those you will develop a good understanding of things.

I’m old enough to remember going with my dad to the bank and then the post office on Saturday mornings. My boys don’t have that experience.
