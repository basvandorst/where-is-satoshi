Thank you AlienBlue.

No, it just guesses.

I was just looking at my Coinbase activity and saw this: Sold 3.32222545 BTC for for $416.96.
Payment will be sent to Chase - Bank *****1**3 by Thursday Oct 17, 2013.
Now I don't feel so bad.

I’ve had it with a debit card from my credit union, and a PayPal debit card. Neither wanted a police report.
@_date: 2019-10-25 00:31:15
Really? I’ve had a few fraudulent card transactions and card companies have never asked me to file a police report.

I believe it just honors what you have set in your wallet preferences. Frugal, Normal, or Generous.

I bought myself a month with BTC, but who am I to turn down free gold?

Domain squatting. How innovative.

He's found 12 blocks already. Why isn't he solo mining? That's 300 BTC. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 20:32:03
I'll have to check on [that address]( periodically. Do you know who sent the extra 1 BTC to him?

On the bright side, [he won on a satoshi dice 18% bet]( so his luck isn't all bad.

Well, the foundation does have a 1st gen 4 module Avalon… but mining itself does not require that you register as money service business. If you sell mined coins you do. 
@_date: 2013-03-18 01:08:11
Yeah, I was thinking of how easy it would be for a kidnapper to generate a paper wallet and demand that a bunch of BTC be sent to that address. No worries of dropping off/picking up a big suitcase of cash.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:18:42
Nice try, Coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-02-21 22:15:35
I'd think  if there's a trader close to you.

Yes. I think you need 5 posts and 3 hours browsing to post outside the newb board.

I've been mining happily at btcoxygen.com. 2% fee flat PPS. Considering starting my own pool. Low fee to ensure resources for the server. I've only got about 850 MH/sec in my mining operation. 
@_date: 2013-01-31 13:31:08
Will the bot even process tips that small?
@_date: 2013-08-20 16:39:52


That 10 minute window?
@_date: 2013-05-25 03:12:09
I search my local craigslist a lot for "Bitcoin". Just to see what people are offering. I'd post there first.
@_date: 2013-03-30 21:43:37
4 cents to free is a real ass kicker. 
@_date: 2013-02-24 01:11:23
Check the transaction detail in the client. Copy the transaction ID and search it at blockchain.info. 
@_date: 2013-02-07 04:13:40
Are you afraid we're in a new bitcoin bubble and the price will fall below $1 soon?
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:21:32
People do stupid shit like deleting a wallet or forgetting a pass phrase. 
@_date: 2013-02-07 02:48:06
0.04 BTC is about $0.85. Is that really what you're looking for?

I actually paid for my reddit gold by telling the bot where to send the BTC from my boitcointip wallet. It was pretty slick. I just watched for the transaction to appear in the blockchain before telling coinbase I had sent the funds.
