No alt has the security of bitcoin and scaling on those chains is impossible to guage because of lack of use. Remember how Ethereum was faster than bitcoin? Until it wasn't. In 2017 there were plenty of times I waited far longer than 10 minutes for a confirmation. Sure, it was faster, until it was being used. Most of these projects face the same, similar or completely different scaling issues. What bitcoin has is a far higher security rate, liquidity, trust, time, etc. It doesn't need to be fast or necessarily cheap to use to be the world's best settlement layer.

What is the contract address? I created a contract that broke ether down into "Watts" a few years back. You can find the thread here ( which also lists the GitHub where the coding can be found. It ended up being pretty expensive to use however, so I just ended up abandoning it. This was before the 2017 pump which ended up driving me underground for around a year because of all the sudden family/friends/random people contacting me about my holdings. I am more interested in the contract itself than I am using these "butts" though to be honest.

Problem is I used to pay 0.0001 all day long in fees with no problem getting into the first block. This was back at the $250-75 btc price range. Price is 400% higher against USD, and yet the fees are also up around 400% against bitcoin. That is some wild % increase in fees. Why would anybody use this in its current state as a means of exchange? I love bitcoin, but it is pretty much only good to hodl and pray price keeps going up. To actually USE bitcoin has become such a nightmare. And believe me, I absolutely loved the idea of bitcoin, but there is no denying that it is falling behind and quickly needs to do something, because it's a huge turnoff in its current state. I almost shake at the thought of moving coins nowadays. I just leave them sitting on a hardware wallet and don't even bother with them.

We are going to retest $1,800 not too long from now. We will probably swing around there for a while and then either break up to current levels or break down to another support level.

I've got it all figured out. 8 is default for outbound connections I believe, but I wasn't open to receiving inbound connections through port 8333. I ended up using the port forwarding on my router to allow inbound connections. I am now getting around 5/6 at the moment inbound and always a steady 8 outbound (which is default). I will be leaving my node up and running 24/7 this way others can connect to it if need be.

I am just trying to look up balances of an address. I have heard that you can use a full node as a private block explorer so you don't risk looking up an address by a non-private means. For instance, if I look up a certain address every couple of days from a block explorer website, if somebody were to be watching my IP they could deduce that I was checking my own balance. I believe it was the [Brian Lockhart on Running a Bitcoin Full Node]( episode of What Bitcoin Did that he breaks down the importance of this. Do you have any idea what he is exactly talking about?

No point unless you are doing something illegal? Not everybody wants their private business sitting out there for the picking. Data privacy (especially financial data) should be kept as private as possible. I will buy something on a credit card at the electronic shop and get ads for the same thing a few hours later online. Financial privacy has nothing to do with laws. Especially when in China you are starting to see Social Credit. Who wants their Government wiping out their credit because they bought something disagreeable? It's a slippery slope.

So use Cash App. I buy &amp; withdraw in 15 seconds for around 1%. Honestly can't beat that. Price swings multiple percent on an average day anyway, so a 1% fee really is fair. Especially when you can instantly buy with debit and withdraw to your own wallet. I use Gemini as well, but honestly I use Cash App 99% of the time just because it's honestly untouchable in this space. God BLESS Cash App.

So you are making $300+ per day? $1,500+ per week? $78,000 per year? Yet you are wondering if Turbo Tax or Credit Karma is better? If you are making $78,000 per year or more, I think you can afford to go see a proper CPA to file for you, especially when you are claiming multiple sources of income and such. You also mention how you've "traded a few times" which means every single trade is a taxable event. You could very easily screw yourself over. Take the loss and forget about it. Also, go see a proper CPA.
@_date: 2019-11-16 16:09:52
You're obviously new to this. Just forget you even have bitcoin. You obviously didn't put in more than you could afford to lose, so just carry on living your life, secure your bitcoin seed and forget you even own any. Don't sell. Clearly you don't know what bitcoin is. Only a lunatic or somebody in desperate need for quick cash for an emergency would sell bitcoin for fiat. Just relax man. All us old timers have been through this a thousand times. Just hold on and relax.

Coinbase is DISGUSTING! Back in mid 2015 they banned me for life because they made a banking error on my account. After pointing this out and being sent higher up the ranks they agreed with me. Was my account ban ever lifted? No. Here we are over 4+ years later and I am still banned. This is Coinbase for you, this is the common story among way too many people. His tin hat is far smaller than yours. People don't like Coinbase for many, many reasons, this is why there is a **DeleteCoinbase** movement in the community the likes of which are not seen with any other exchange. Coinbase is as dirty as they come.

As in my real feelings? Yes, this is very much how I really feel. When bitcoin is low and steady and technical progress is moving along the only people who really care about bitcoin are the people who actually care about bitcoin. This is when the really exciting stuff is talked about, debated, when actual progress is made. When bitcoin is parabolic the only thing you read about and hear about is everybody and their grandma wondering "when moon"? I enjoy the years when we are focusing on innovation of the technology opposed to the fattening of out fiat pockets. May bitcoin stay low and steady for many, many more years!

The best way would be to buy a decent chunk of coin through Bisq, send to Wasabi wallet and CoinJoin to an anonymity set of at least 150, the higher the better. New address for every transaction is a given.

Buy shitcoins on a KYC exchange, withdraw to wallet, send shitcoins to another KYC exchange so it's re-linked to your identity and buy bitcoin, withdraw those bitcoins which are tied to your ID to Wasabi and then CoinJoin them. Orrrr... buy bitcoin from KYC exchange to Wasabi. CoinJoin. Create a new address in Wasabi and send, CoinJoin them again, only this time CoinJoin until at least 150 Anonymity set, done.

Except that when I got involved years ago it was in an extremely bearish market when everybody was jumping ship, not getting involved. It was the technology, philosophy and idea of bitcoin that drew me in. I was never looking to get rich or to even make any money in this and I never put in any more than I was afraid to lose. I have lost, given away, used and played around with countless amounts of bitcoins and don't regret it one bit. This isn't about making money, this is about having an alternative currency/store of value independent of any third party or government entity. It's about freedom, not about earning potential. How is this being selfish?

Why are you storing 1+ bitcoin on exchanges? The entire community has been screaming from the roof tops NOT to do this for many, many years. Not your keys, not your bitcoin. So exactly ZERO of your bitcoin was stolen because you never possessed any in the first place. You have also provided absolutely no information, no addresses, no means of the actual hack, nothing at all, yet you ask for help? How can anybody even begin to help with the information you have provided? Your bitcoin is gone, not that you possessed any in the first place. But the bitcoin that was being held for you is no longer being held for you, it's gone. This was a very expensive lesson for you unfortunately. SFYL.

I did, I get the point. It costs a shitload to move that much worth in gold and far, far less to move bitcoin. I was directly answering the question though. To move $5B in bitcoin entirely depends on how many unspent outputs there are in the transaction, which will determine the overall byte size of the TX. Either way it will be astronomically cheaper to move bitcoin, but there is no correct answer to your initial question. ;)

I will paste the same answer as I gave above.
Lol, how did you get that? I mean, I could transfer you 3 or even 10 or 100 bitcoins right now if you just posted a simple address, no questions asked. The banks are the one demanding KYC, AML, social security number, the blood of your first born child and so on. Bitcoin asks no such questions. Your problem is that you don't already have the private key to spend 3 bitcoins. Should've got in before the banks went ape shit and started demanding everything. This is a legacy banking problem along with outrageous government overreach.

You are completely missing the point of my post here. I am not looking to buy $100 worth of bitcoin, I am looking to buy $100 worth of United States Dollars WITH my bitcoin. Look at the value of dollars against bitcoin however, it's WAY down this year. Bitcoin price fluctuates? Looks the other way around. Look at the dollar compared to bitcoin. 9 months ago 1 bitcoin would've bought me $3,000 but today I can get nearly $12,000 for 1 bitcoin. 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin still. But it looks like the dollar is crashing this past year. The price of these dollars are swinging all over the place. They crashed down to 1 bitcoin getting me nearly $20,000 of them in late 2017 and then they skyrocketed throughout 2018 so 1 bitcoin would only get me around $3,000 of them but lately they've been crashing hard again, really hard. So now might be a good time to buy just a small bag full of those United States Dollars. I don't know though, they just keep printing more, so they might still have a long way down to go. I just think I'll hold my bitcoin in the end and refrain from buying any United States Dollars, it really doesn't seem worth the risk. I don't like volatility. I think that Dollars have a long way down to go still.

You don't hodl it, you use it as a hedge against hyperinflation. When you get paid at lunchtime but by time you go shopping after work your currency has lost half it's value, it's useless. Libra is not = to $1 USD, it's stable even against the USD. It would be tied to a breadbasket of currencies and assets to retain it's stability, even against the USD. A breadbasket idea is actually pretty smart, MakerDAO uses it as well. A lot of people in the world are facing hyperinflation of their currency and to have stability is the difference they need. It serves a completely different purpose than bitcoin. The two can co-exist. Libra is not a store of value, nor is bitcoin a stable currency. They both serve separate purposes.

Lol, how did you get that? I mean, I could transfer you 3 or even 10 or 100 bitcoins right now if you just posted a simple address, no questions asked. The banks are the one demanding KYC, AML, social security number, the blood of your first born child and so on. Bitcoin asks no such questions. Your problem is that you don't already have the private key to spend 3 bitcoins. Should've got in before the banks went ape shit and started demanding everything. This is a legacy banking problem along with outrageous government overreach.

It's disturbing. The good news is that they are mostly young folk who will turn conservative real quick as soon as they try to build property, get a medical bill or really just get out there into the real world period. I am currently nearly 2 years into construction on a 6,000 square foot multi-live in home for myself, parents and my sisters family. The builder is phenomenal and would have had the job done in 4-6 months without all the government monopoly over everything. Need an inspection? We'll be there in a month or two, not show up and then arrive a month after that. Need the water turned on? No free market there, just the government run water company. When will they come? Who cares, they're getting paid either way. Without competition, honestly, why should they even bother? It's not like they will lose market share. But let's give the government MORE control over our lives. �� How about that $5,000 medical bill for an 8 hour hospital stay? Vitals checks, all seems good, $5,000! Why? Because of all the derelicts who don't pay. Somebody has to pay. But let's give free healthcare to everybody who wants it, legal citizen or not! Who pays? Well once these young, ignorant (I say this in the nicest but most true sense) liberals get into the workforce and are being taxed upwards of 70% they'll be crying. But wait! Just raise the minimum wage to $30+ an hour! This way we can pay 70-90% taxes for free healthcare, college and lollipops for all and still have a livable income. Because that's totally fair for the business owners and economy! My head literally spins just trying to understand these people's minds. When I was a high school student I semi had views like them, so I can kind of be compassionate towards the youngins, but any adult who thinks like that must be seriously mentally challenged or Ill.

You mean can I lose 0.0085 BTC? I am looking to purchase 100 USD with bitcoin, but I noticed how unstable the US Dollar has been against bitcoin, especially this past year. In the past 6 months alone the USD has lost nearly 230% of it's bitcoin value and it's price swings are all over the place. I think I am going to wait a little bit until USD falls even more to grab a small bag of them, maybe 100 or so. I am not really willing to lose any bitcoin to be honest, especially when the USD seems to be collapsing this past year. You must not have read my post and misunderstood me.

Nobody ever said it was anonymous. It's pseudonymous. Here is a decent explanation: 
@_date: 2019-08-04 13:48:59
My answer? Vitalik* Buterin cannot just "change the eth code". Even back in the early days when I was an Ethereum fanboy and we went through TheDAO fork Vitalik couldn't just force that on us, and in fact consensus was never achieved, that is why we have Ethereum/Ethereum Classic. Ethereum is a decentralized protocol that is decided on by the node operators. If Vitalik changed his code he would end up forking off the main chain and be alone. He would need to convince the majority of people to adopt his change. After TheDAO occurred there was a sizeable branch of people who did not want to break immutability and never ran the DAO Fork chain and continued the original chain under Ethereum Classic. It's laws are governed after Bitcoin, which is decentralization. Vitalik with the help of others co-founded Ethereum, they put it in play. They can't just change code and give the finger to everybody. If people don't like it, they simply won't run the code. Just like with bitcoin and the many, many forks it's had over the years. When consensus isn't reached, a fork occurs. Same goes for Bitcoin Cash. The B-Cash devs can't just change the code, they would need everybody to run the new code, if the people don't want to, they won't. Just like Craig Wright's group of nutjobs. They supported Bitcoin Cash until they didn't like "the code" anymore, so they changed it and forked off into BSV. Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin because they didn't like "the code" anymore as well. So they changed theirs and the ones who wanted it started running their nodes. This is exactly the same for Ethereum. If Vitalik changes the code (which anybody can do by the way, even you or I) we would still need to convince everyone that "hey, this is a better way, please start running Version Blah.Blah instead of the older version". As much as I don't care for Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and ESPECIALLY BSV... they are still modeled after decentralization and operate on the same founding principals of any decentralized software. XRP is NOT decentralized. What the guy who said Vitalik could do with Ethereum, just changing the code (he can't), XRP devs COULD actually do this. They are like PayPal, Venmo or any other of these P2P money transmitters. You agree to their terms and have no say whatsoever. I hope this has cleared up my position on why the guy who said "Vatelik can change the eth code, the btc cash devs can change that" has no idea what he is talking about. I am 100% a bitcoin (BTC) maximalist and urge you to 100% drop any other shitcoin you hold and only hold bitcoin. Long live bitcoin!
EDIT: Concerning this quote: "Anyone can push btc code and it needs to be voted on before it's patched in." This is exactly the same with Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, etc. Nobody actually votes in bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin cash, etc. Your "vote" is really just your node. You either accept the Bitcoin Core devs proposed changes or you don't. You either accept the Ethereum devs changes or you don't (TheDAO fork as example). You either accept the Bitcoin Cash devs changes or you don't. You can propose a change yourself. We can accept to run it or not. If your proposal was accepted by a small group, you can all start running that and fork away from bitcoin. Anyone can push changes for anyone of those blockchains, they all operate on consensus.
Also, please forgive formatting, I am writing all of this from a mobile device.

@_date: 2019-08-12 11:03:30
If you go to any exchange that makes you pay 1-3% fees to purchase you'd be paying similar if not higher prices. Remember, most exchanges charge a fee of 1 or 2% to buy, ATMs charge far higher fees. Cash App has the fee baked into the price, called a spread. There is no other fees at all, not even a withdrawal fee.
1% of $11,359 = $113.59.
$11,359 + $113.59 = $11,472.59. As you can see, you are paying a hair more than 1% for instant buy, instant withdrawal, all from a reputable source where you have absolutely nothing to worry about. Smooth as butter experience all the way around.

Even the Twitter handle is brand new and only has made those posts. Who hasn't lost something to crypto? I've been scammed a few times since 2013, never recouped any of those lost coins. I've still made money holding (hodling) however. So just tell Mamma Bear to have her husband STOP TRADING and START HODLING! If this is even a legit story, which I highly doubt. IMHO this is some dumbass attempting to act on the generous nature of some people, but unfortunately for them nobody in crypto is this retarded. We have seen it all and this is why these kind of posts are not allowed here. NO BEGGING! Just go buy your own crypto and stop begging for other people to give theirs away.

I've been in bitcoin since 2015, starting with CrapBase and Circle (I loved Circle) and have used endless exchanges and instant trade sites like ShapeShift and Changelly before regulations crapped on all of us. I have to say that Cash App is the easiest way to obtain bitcoin I have yet to see. Very reasonable prices, extremely easy service, excellent service all around. Such a shame you're having issues.

XRP is the bottom of the bucket and absolutely a disgrace to this space and what we are trying to build here. The whole point of this is immutability, security, decentralization, etc... none of which XRP has. XRP is absolutely trash and holding 15% XRP is holding 15% too much. 100% bitcoin or nothing.

I think it'll be going a lot lower than that once real regulation kicks in. 95% of this market is fake and we couldn't even get an ETF passed on the legitimate 5% of the market. Arbitrage between the legitimate market and the fake market is keeping the price aloft. Once that 95% goes away this market will be so thin who knows what will happen. This is an extremely long game with tons, tons, tons that can go wrong still. Way too much hopium in this sub. We need more voices of reason in here. A huge crash may be the healthiest thing for bitcoin in the end. I have complete faith in bitcoin, but I think that the road is a lot longer than people realize or want and will be filled with many bumps and potholes along the way. At the end of the day though, people shouldn't be so concerned about the price. Get a good job, keep moving forward, only put in what you can afford to lose and forget about it.

Perhaps it is you who should look a little bit deeper. Might want to actually give that interview a listen while remaining 100% skeptical. I wouldn't trust Phil Potter with anything either and he really has nothing to do with my reasoning behind Tether.

AML/KYC (anti money laundering/know your customer). It means any business transmitting in money has to confirm the identity of the person they are dealing with. Banks, exchanges, etc need to confirm who you are. They are also required to report certain things, like deposits over a certain amount into your bank account and such. If you are in the USA this is common knowledge. As to your original question, just download Cash App and get instant buy/withdrawal. There is a baked in fee in their selling price but no other fees. In total it amounts to around 1.5% fee it appears, perhaps a little less. There is no withdrawal fee, no miners fee, they pay for all of that.
EDIT: Cash App fees:

His IQ has nothing to do with it. You learned this same thing at some point. He's never seen it before as he is entirely new to the markets, how would he just magically know? I am glad he asked, there are no stupid questions. At least he is eager to learn and interested in knowing more. Not to mention your God awful grammar speaks a lot to your personal IQ level. "You IQ"? Lack of proper punctuation. Laughing at someone for their level of understanding something new to them also speaks volumes to your personal character, which appears to be a very weak one. We have all been new here and will all continue to learn new things, there is nothing inherently funny about that. Laughing at someone for wanting to learn? Extremely weak and pathetic. Bullies are the most transparent people, you can truly see their personal insecurities, weakness and self loathing.

Seriously man. Even if you bought bitcoin at $1 way back in the early MtGox days the market would still be down 1.46% from yesterday. It's not reflecting your personal gains/losses, it is reflecting where the price of bitcoin was this exact moment yesterday to this exact moment today. You can change it to different time frames also (1 year, 6 months, 1 month, 1 day, 12 hours, 1 hour and many options in between). I believe you are looking at the 24 hour chart, in which case the price of bitcoin itself is down, NOT YOU. You could be a bitcoin millionaire who bought in the penny levels and guess what, your bitcoin portfolio would still be down 1.46% from this time yesterday (not from when you bought). Capisci?

DCA is your friend. Just buy a set amount every week/month and forget it. Never buy/sell on emotion. Honestly, why even sell? Has bitcoin clicked yet in your head? Has the lightbulb turned on? Like I've said before, this isn't a get rich quick, magic bean, pyramid scheme scam. This is revolutionary, absurdly amazing stuff! Bitcoin is an immutable, borderless, trustless, permissionless, censorship resistant, honest ledger. The world has never seen anything like this before. This is still very early in the grand scheme of things, but the toddler years. She still has so much growing up to do, so much evolving. Just dollar cost average in for the next several decades. Live off the fiat you don't put in and just let your bitcoin grow. There will be far more opportunities with your bitcoin down the road. Don't be in a rush to get there. This is unbelievable stuff. Forget the USD price and stacks your coins.

Hello, fellow New Yorker here. You have three solid options. I won't list any place that you can buy but NOT withdraw because that isn't crypto.

Short term? Some of us have been involved for several years and have rode several waves. Bitcoin is 10 years old. How is this short term? Sure it sucks for accumulating more bitcoin, but you can still DCA. Who cares what the USD price is honestly, just keep DCAing no matter what the price is.

I'm sorry about your heavy shitcoin bags. They've been bleeding red against bitcoin for 1.5 years now and things are only looking worse as of late. You need to stop looking only at the daily charts and zoom out a little bit. It's an ugly sight for sure. Plus nobody wants bags of worthless crap anymore. Good luck to you and hopefully they do pump a little bit for you so you can recover some of the bitcoin you've lost holding and trading in shitcoins. My advice, as soon as you get a decent pump, dump that shit immediately into bitcoin and salvage at least a pittance of the bitcoin you've already seen dwindle and then just hold. Who cares about the price of bitcoin in the short weeks, months, years? The technology is just being bootstrapped so the price is going to go up and down like crazy. Better to just strap in and hold on then to move back and forth from market to market.

I don't wish to see that again, even if it meant bitcoin going to a million dollars. Only a narcissist would be that cold. Far less than a fraction of a % of people hold bitcoin, what happens to the masses? Out of my entire immediate/extended family maybe 2 others besides me hold bitcoin. To be hopeful for another financial crisis is to hope for extremely hard times for my closest family and friends. Fuck that! I am all for bitcoin mooning, but not at the expense of 99% of regular decent people.

You clearly don't understand the basics of what bitcoin changed to all the other systems. u/czechcryptomania said it, faster block times is less secure. Nodes need time to sync, or you end up with more orphaned blocks. 10 minutes is a great block time. For speed you have choices. PayPal, Venmo, Visa, etc. Bitcoin brought something completely new to the table.

You must be extremely new to bitcoin or just never have looked into it at all. This debate is just about as old as bitcoin itself is. The block limit is fine for now, and I might go so far as to agree with Luke Dashjr about the size needing a decrease if anything at the moment, but I don't think it's that dire. If you want bigger block sizes head on over to Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV.

There are fees of course. This isn't a NY thing, this is in everything. When you buy a stock you pay a fee. When you buy anything you pay a tax. This is how exchanges make money. In every state and every country there are fees in crypto and most other things. Usually it's only 1-2% at most. Gemini recently went up to 2% and this is the reason I primarily use Cash App. Cash App has their fees baked into the price you buy at. The price you pay for bitcoin is a little over 1% higher than market value, but you pay no additional fees and can withdraw with no withdrawal/miner fee, they pay that. Cash App is instant as well. If you send Gemini or Coinbase money from the bank (unless you wire it) it takes around a week to clear in your account. Cash App you link your debit card, buy and can immediately withdraw the bitcoin to your own wallet. I've been involved in crypto for 4 years now and as a New Yorker Cash App is by far your best option. Its fee is great, it's instant buy/withdrawal is AWESOME and I have never had a single problem with them.
@_date: 2019-06-06 00:59:59
I don't doubt the method, it just isn't for me. I am not new to crypto and never got involved for the investment aspect of it.

I could care less if bitcoin dropped back to $250 tomorrow or went to $25,000 tomorrow. This might be good advice for the people who are just interested in lining their own pockets, but that isn't me. I have a full time job to pay my bills, crypto is just my hobby and keeps my mind occupied and excited.

Buttcoin is a satirical name for bitcoin, not Facebook's coin. It has been for many, many years. Even I sometimes call bitcoin "the butts" when talking to friends.

Also, I am all for bitcoin and hold zero BCH, just for the record. I just find this hard to believe. I often see this theory brought up here about the bitcoin.com wallet tricking people and have downloaded it myself to see what the commotion was about. It is CLEARLY marked "Bitcoin Cash (BCH)" and "Bitcoin Core (BTC)"... so why the fuck would anybody send BTC to a wallet labeled BCH? Just fucking stupid as hell. This HAS to be a trolling post.

Hasn't LocalBitcoin gone the KYC route or has that not kicked in yet? Here in NY we can't even use Kraken or Bittrex anymore. To use crypto in NY the exchange in question must obtain a NYS BitLicense. Bittrex applied but recently announced that it was not granted. It has gotten worse and worse over the years. We used to just turn on a VPN and use ShapeShift or just go onto any exchange. We used to be able to give ANY name while making an account on an exchange, even an obviously fake name. Since 2017 things have rapidly changed for the entire USA, but NY is on a whole other level. Not only do we have to deal with strict USA regulations, but NYS regulations are tighter than a virgins pussy. It's pretty disgusting if you're into shitcoins, but if you're just into bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and a very few others you are golden here in NY. Personally my portfolio is 90% bitcoin and 10% ether. I only still hold 10% ETH because I coded a contract back in late 2016 when I was interested in the idea of smart contracts. Now it's just nostalgia for me.

I never could understand how people don't notice the change in address. When I copy an address I look at the first 3/4 and last 3/4 digits/letters in the address and after I paste I make sure they're the same. This is a practice I have been doing since the begining of my bitcoin days. Not even because of viruses or malware but because of fear of missing a letter or it not copying or anything at all. Just look at the address and see that it matches. Good habit to make early.

I will start taking legal actions against the company behind Coinomi if they don’t act and take the responsibility. The company is registered in UK as “Coinomi LTD” if anyone one has faced or facing similar case were you suddenly lost your crypto assets and you happen to have used Coinomi wallet. The funny thing is that they state on their website:
“Most importantly, no Coinomi wallet has ever been hacked or otherwise compromised to date.” (bull****!)
Be aware that probably all desktop versions are affected (I’m not sure about the mobile versions) and the guy/group who is/are capturing the passphrases, possibly targeting only wallets with decent amount of assets to stay low profile as long as he/they can.

I've done one trade with a Reddit member in the four years I've been in crypto. I would've never done it but it was crypto to crypto and he offered to make the first move. We did it in increments of three separate trades just in case, so if I did screw him over it wasn't for a big chunk. Everything went smooth in the end, thankfully, but I don't advise it. I would've never done it hadn't he offered to make the first move on each trade. He took a huge risk, but thankfully I'm just an average Joe and wasn't looking to rob him.

This is extremely sad to behold. You're just graduating high school? You are still extremely, extremely young. Do yourself a favor and go to college. Life is not all about money and college could get your foot in the door to a decent career in a budding crypto related area. The entire fintech area is an exciting one, financial expertise, computer science, coding, you name it. Gambling on bitcoin and altcoins for a little bit of bread in your future is extremely dumb. As you get older you'll want more fulfillment out of life and regret having thrown away your younger years to achieve it.

That's not how it works. It doesn't go by amount of bitcoin but the byte size for the transaction. This all depends on how many outputs you are spending. Your wallet should allow you to choose sat/B tx fee.

I listened to the same podcast, I listen to every WBD episode and I agree with the fact that Luke Dashjr is an unbelievably smart guy, like on a completely different level than most of the Core team. He has some extremely valid points. It would make it easier for everybody to run a node therefore strengthening bitcoin as a whole. The amount of people using light clients is staggering and getting dangerous and not at all how bitcoin is supposed to operate. It's a really tough call to be honest with you. I think 2MB where we are right now is alright for the most part, but I don't think we should be raising it any time soon. In a perfect world we should lower it a bit (for now), but I think that we can pull it off in the long run leaving it where it is, for now.

Absolutely false. Have you ever even used the marketplaces? Dream, Wall Street, Empire? Forget "was" and let's stick with what IS. A lot of the current markets are going down at the moment, but they all primarily use bitcoin. Almost nobody is using XMR at the markets. The liquidity just isn't there like bitcoin is. If you don't know how to properly clean your coins for use on the markets then just stay off them. But don't pretend to know what people are using when you clearly have no idea.

Robinhood sucks. You bought on FOMO and that is a clear indication of a short-term correction on the way. Just sell that coin on Robinhood and rebuy it on an exchange that you can remove it to a cold wallet from. Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick magic bean pyramid scheme scam, it's ground breaking tech that you have absolutely no idea about. You have no idea how revolutionary bitcoin is to the world and how young it really is and how far it can go. The price is stupid, the technology is the cool part. This is the biggest thing the financial system has seen since the switch from shells to fiat. This is massive! Forget the price. Just buy some every week, month or whatever. DCA is the best way to do it. Forget the USD price and just focus on getting more coin. Bitcoin has decades to go, you aren't late to the party. We are just 10 years into something this world has never seen before and it goes much further than money. An immutable, borderless, trustless, permissionless, censorship resistant, honest ledger is inconceivable. My dick has been hard since I got involved several years ago. I should definitely see a doctor because my hardon hasn't gone down and has only gotten harder the more I've learned about it. You need to get your bitcoin into your own wallet though. Don't let anybody else hold your coins for you. You can start to learn more here:

All have been shipped to personal residence and never have had any problems. I think you just got robbed because it was a package not because it had a Ledger name or logo on it. Honestly, not too many people out there even know what a Ledger is. Report the package as stolen and hopefully it will be made right.

Yes, just let your bitcoin sit. Don't buy/sell to try to make money. Just buy/hold and then buy some more. Use bitcoin and then replenish it. Cash app is nice to buy stuff with bitcoin. Instead of using bitcoin from my cold storage, when I buy something with bitcoin I just use my debit on Cash app to buy bitcoin instantly and then withdraw to the merchant to pay. This way it's exactly like paying from my debit card, except I can pay with bitcoin. I love supporting merchants who accept bitcoin.

Are you sure that the address you sent to is the correct address that Coinbase provided to you? There are malwares that replace the copy/paste function when you copy a bitcoin address. But this is not necessarily the case. Could just be a glitch with the wallet or perhaps it isn't synced up. If it is Coinbase your best bet is contacting Coinbase support. If the address you were provided IS indeed the address you sent to AND it shows on a blockchain explorer as confirmed than your funds are perfectly safe.

No. Nothing like that exists, for good reason. PayPal is reversible. Nobody would let you buy an irreversible asset with reversible funding. Cash App allows instant buy/transfer with debit, but I don't know about credit. Using credit to buy bitcoin is extremely reckless imho. If you work and have a steady income, just DCA your buys with each paycheck. Don't FOMO buy with credit and PayPal is just insanity.

A little under 2 years. I had teeth removed though, new bone put in that had to heal in order to support implants, etc. There is a few months needed for the bone to fuse and whatnot.

Coinbase is the shithole of the bitcoin world. Of course you can't withdraw to your own wallet. You need to wait ages. You can buy and hold with them for a week or until they ban you for no reason. Use Cash App next time and buy/withdraw within seconds, not days/weeks. Coinbase can suck my dick!

Yes, but factor in that more and more people have heard of bitcoin each peak. Market has become more saturated and mature. Overall market cap has grown. Going from $1M to $10M market cap is a lot easier than $100B to $1T. Past results also do not guarantee future results.

This is false. No wallet takes a % of what you send. It was probably the fee you set which goes to the miner who mined the block your transaction was added into. You are free to set fees at whatever you like. Remember, inputs add up as well. If you had a ton of smaller txs going into your wallet and sent a bunch at once, you're going to want to use a higher fee. Somewhere along the line though YOU made an error, not coinomi. Also, I hate Coinomi, there are endless better wallets, but I won't fabricate some bullshit reason like "they are skimming 20% from me". Just isn't happening.

Nobody but Jesus knows the answer to this. If you are buying something with BTC it is always safest to convert at POS (point of sale) rather than buy &amp; hope to God you make a few extra dollars. If you are involved for the technology, stick around. Again though, nobody knows. BTC could go back to $180-250 like it was in 2015 or back to $20,000, which in my humble opinion is highly unlikely for quite some time, if at all.

Who says I haven't taken profits over the years? I've sold from $500 to $17,000 range. Granted I didn't sell the peak, but who cares? I got into bitcoin, and moreso Ethereum for the technology. Believe it or not, but I am SO HAPPY about this crash. All the lambo assholes can gtfo and let us get back to work. There was a beautiful time when not everybody ONLY cared about making money. That is what your job is for. This isn't a get rich quick scheme, it's decentralization of everything. It's taking trust out of the equation. You haven't been around long enough to understand the implications of things like Smart Contracts. There is so much more to the crypto ecosystem than "where's my Moon lambo already?!!". I am so thankful that people like you are leaving &amp; fudding. The more you fud, the more the moon kiddies head out in troves. This is excellent for the tech. I remember how terrified Vlad from Ethereum became when Ether started to take off. The unnatural growth is not the best route for scaling or building. In quite times, we build.
Edit: Grammar.

Life's work? I hope people wouldn't as well. Go way back into my post history as well. I got involved in Q4 2015, my first buy in was on October 24, 2015 through Coinbase @ $281.37. I have been buying ever since. I was obsessed with Ethereum when they were below $7.00. I took a portion of every check through the past several years, a portion I could afford to lose &amp; built up my holdings. Back then it wasn't about the "sick gains" but about the excitement of the new technology. Blockchain isn't all about money, smart contracts are amazing! Being there for TheDAO, even though it was a disaster, was an amazing part of history. Today I am doing phenomenal, I have taken profits along the way and owe a huge part of my success to being involved in blockchain. I remember when Mike Hearn left &amp; caused panic through the community, today is nothing new. You are sour because you were always in this for the money. You warn people because of a lack of understanding &amp; personal financial loss. Plenty of us have only moved up in life thanks to this tech. If BTC isn't your thing, look into what smart contracts can enable. Bitcoin will also enable stuff like this soon enough. Don't judge the technology because you got in at the wrong time. Sell everything, that's fine, but keep your eye out on this tech. It's very exciting stuff!

This is normal as can be. Circle is trusted as can be and a BitLicense holder in NYS. Circle is reviewing things because they follow the law. This is the normal procedure. Nothing to worry about. I wouldn't call the value dropping 12 cents in 20 minutes to be "rapid" either. Bitcoin is volatile as can be, has been for years! Quite simply, the price of a bitcoin has dropped slightly since you bought. 12 cents is nothing to worry about at all, and your money is not disappearing. If you held an Oz of gold and the price dropped $30 USD an ounce, the value of your holdings would show a USD drop in value of 30 dollars. Bitcoin is an asset and applies by the same rules. Circle is great for bitcoin and an awesome, trust worthy company as well. Nothing at all to worry about unless you have reason to believe that you have done something wrong. If you are legit and were honest signing up than the review will be quick and painless. You can contact them with ways to speed it up. A year ago I sent a selfie of me holding my license up next to my face along with a clear copy of my license. It sped things right along. Just like any other financial institution, KYC applies.

Exactly the same. I have been involved in bitcoin since 2015, prices were in the mid-200 dollar region. I have a regular job and always put a small part into BTC/ETH and later into a few other projects. I don't day trade, and I live a moderately simple lifestyle. Nothing has changed over the past several years and crypto isn't my job. I have other things I am more focused on currently, like my upcoming wedding and CDL test.

There's your reason. This should've been a no brainer. Not that you did anything wrong, but the outcome was obvious. Especially if you're adding it in the description. Most financial institutions have somewhat of an issue with bitcoin at the time being. I'm sorry you've been banned, that sucks. Venmo definitely is convenient.

My coins were moved to my Wasabi address from my cold storage wallet which is already tied to me through KYC exchange withdrawals, so any blockchain analysis could've already told you that. My Wasabi address would always be linked until a mixing process is done. I am unconcerned for the time being anyway as my involvement in bitcoin has always been for legitimate reasons. I have never used bitcoin for illicit activity and have paid my capital gains taxes every year since I've been involved. I understand the importance of privacy, but until I mix/tumble, that wouldn't be achieved regardless. Thanks for the heads up however, I appreciate it.

Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Cash App, Bittrex, etc, etc. There are so many choices it's insane. You would have had a heart attack several years ago when buying meant mailing cash to some random guy with your address written on a piece of paper inside the envelope and then hoping to God it was legit. It's gotten 100x easier to obtain bitcoin nowadays. It's not complicated at all, you just need to go about it correctly. Like any other financial institution you will need to go through KYC/AML and get verified. Once that happens you can go about obtaining whatever you want.

There is healthy growth and then there is "pumping". Right now the hash rate being what it is is what's really exciting. The security of the network is at an all time high which is far more important than the price being at an ATH. Who cares what the fiat exchange rate is at the moment? Only short term traders should care about that. If you are holding long term and see the long term potential in bitcoin then even if the price halved from here tomorrow, who cares? Let's just keep building this thing, securing it more and more, solve current issues, build more tools on top of and around this thing and make it the driving force and engine to a better future.
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:02:33
At 17 you might as well establish some reputation at r/Cash4Cash and use either PayPal, Cash App or Venmo to trade for bitcoin. I wouldn't use blockchain.com's wallet. Go to  and find a wallet for a beginner, one that you run locally on your own device, not from some website. If you need help just come here and ask more questions, it's how we all have learned. You are under 18 years old, which means to use an exchange you will need a parent or trusted older friend.

First off, I am extremely sorry for your loss, this must not be easy. Secondly, as tragic as it is, remember, money comes and goes in life, character is what remains. Do not let this eat you up. Learn and move on. If you stick around in the bitcoin space after this sting, please consider a hardware wallet. 2+ bitcoin should not be stored anywhere else besides a hardware wallet. I wish you nothing but the best moving forward and hopefully many good things may come your way. God bless!

Choose a wallet from here:  (Definitely not "blockchain wallet"). Next install "Cash App" and sign up for it so you can buy bitcoin instantly with your debit card. Next withdraw your bitcoin to your new wallet. Next send the bitcoin to yourself (new address) once or twice (at least) to put distance between you and the bitcoin. Next deposit it into your market address. Finally, buy whatever the hell it is you are trying to buy.

ShapeShift used to be awesome, but I haven't used them in years, especially when I am from NYS. I used to just use a VPN when their "North Korea and NY residents can't use" page would pop up and would be good to go. Voorhees even knew that's what we all were doing but he didn't care, as long as "officially" he blocked us NY residents he had nothing to worry about. But then he jumped on the KYC bandwagon. Honestly, he should have just closed up shop, the same way they left NY in protest of the NY BitLicense bullshit. He could've saved face, but they chose their route. I still respect Erik, he has done a tremendous amount of good for bitcoin over the years, but I am not going to recommend ShapeShift to anybody.

So 9,050 Sats are reserved for when I close the channel? Seems like a bit high of a fee considering I paid only 154 Sats to open the channel. Let me make sure I understand this...
It cost me 154 Sats to open a channel and will cost me 9,050 Sats to close the channel? Or will I be returned the difference once I close?
Also, can you give me any idea on how to receive a lightning transaction with this wallet? I am trying to send from my mobile wallet but it will not allow me. Zap says I can receive 0 Sats. How do I make it so I can receive?

Less coins for miners to sell. For the most part miners don't HODL, as they have expenses in mining to maintain. So having half the amount of coins constantly being sold every 10 minutes or so definitely should have an effect. Hopefully the entire ecosystem grows though, not just the price.

Yes, I do. Stamps and bumper stickers are both signs of seeking attention and validation of your viewpoint when honestly, nobody gives a fuck what you think. I wouldn't say I look down on these people so much as I feel sorry for them. You don't need validation of your thoughts outside of yourself. If you like bitcoin, cool, if you don't, cool. You don't need bumper stickers to tell people what you think about dog's, cats, guns, liberals, Trump, what states you've been to or mountain you've climbed, because nobody cares how you are living your life or what preference of dogs you like. Especially when 99.99% of the people reading them have absolutely no idea who you are and couldn't give a damn either way.

Just got out of the shower, responding from mobile. My PC is off for the night, I will check it out tomorrow. I had two open receiving invoices however when I closed out. I had the earlier one for 5,000 sats open, so perhaps that had something to do with me not being able to receive 100k? My available receiving balance was 100,050, so maybe with an open 5k invoice it looked like 105,050 trying to be received? I have no idea. But the invoices take 60 minutes to invalidate, so when I retry tomorrow both of them will be closed. I will continue to mess around with it all tomorrow. Thankfully it's only $85 worth of BTC between my two lightning wallets, so I don't mind messing around with it. Thanks again for the help and I will be in touch.

Yes, it's just for market swing trading, you don't actually own bitcoin nor can you use it. To own real bitcoin you first need a wallet ( and then buy bitcoin at any exchange (Gemini, Coinbase, Kraken, Bittrex, etc). After you buy bitcoin withdraw it from the exchange to your personal wallet.

Also, I have known JP (creator of Exodus) for several years. He is a good guy and you honestly should not be bashing his software. He will go above and beyond to help you as will I, but this is not the wallets fault. The address you have provided has not been touched in around 8 months. You are missing something. Go back and check your withdrawal addresses from the exchange you use. Every deposit and withdrawal into this address is suspect. You say you had $700 in there but the TOTAL that address has ever received is around $100 at current prices, which would've been WAY WAY less than that in 09/2018.

Yes, the address is visible. You have yet to move any bitcoin into it though. It is entirely unused. You can buy some bitcoin at an exchange, atm, from a friend and move it into that address (if you have the corresponding private key for it). Good luck in your journey and read as much as you can! Also, just start off with a couple dollars worth and send it to your wallet, try sending it to an exchange and withdraw, send back and forth to another wallet you control, do as much with it as possible just to learn the ropes. Once you are comfortable with it then buy some more.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:19:50

You don't even provide a picture in your post to look at. Pictures can be falsified, the bitcoin blockchain cannot. I have offered you multiple ways to get to the bottom of this, of which you have done none.
1. Copy &amp; paste receiving address in wallet application here. Click the RECEIVE tab and send me the address it displays.
2. Go into the exchange you purchased the bitcoin from and check the address that you withdrew to. If you purchased $700 worth and withdrew it to an address then it was not the address you have provided to us.
3. A fee is charged because of the way bitcoin works. It doesn't matter if you send it to yourself or a stranger in Siberia. If you want a miner to include your tx in a block, you use a fee. You can set the fee that you use. Your transactions had ridiculously high fees attached to them.
4. YOU alone sign a transaction, so YOU alone have the answer to why you sent multiple 0.0014 transactions to yourself with a 0.001 fee attached. You literally only sent yourself 0.0004 out of the 0.0014 in every single transaction. That is the WHY to your question of where it all went. It went to the miners because YOU chose it to.
5. Nobody but you can send money from your wallet. If it was a thief they would steal the bitcoin, not send it over and over to yourself. Plus the transactions are spread out by several minutes at a minimum, so this was no mistake by clicking the wrong thing over and over or anything like that.
Since you refuse to help us help you, there is little further we can do. The blockchain is infallible, humans are not. The address you provided shows around $100 going into it and nearly ALL of it being sent in transactions where the mining fee was nearly the entire transaction.

They both get used, sure. But the grammatically correct way to use it would be lower case when not the first word in a sentence. Do you uppercase gold, silver, dollar, yuan, peso, etc? It's an asset/currency, not a person or corporation. It is always bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:49:35
This works best only with obtaining your bitcoins under the table. If a single TX can be traced to you, they all can through following the trail through the blockchain. Also, if you EVER spend from a hash you control on anything that can be tied to your identity, then every tx after that will be traced to you. Basically you have to be unbelievably careful. A single mistake and you are found out. A single Satoshi tied to you sent to any wallet can &amp; will be traced to you. Basically buying completely anon and never moving in and out of any address that can be tied to you. If you send to a new wallet from a wallet that can be traced to you and buy something that can in any way be tied to you, they will find you. Digital footprints for everything physical &amp; digital if bought. You basically can't do anything at all with your bitcoin. I mean nothing. You'd literally have to be perfect in everything you do, not a single mistake. Things you never even knew was a mistake could very well be a mistake. Buy from a complete stranger into an address made on some beyond secret way, MAYBE. Who knows how often the Gov screenshots everything, crawling about the interwebs like we never could imagine. I can't even imagine the secrets the US Government has. They certainly are elite at what they do though. They created stuxnet and infected systems that were never online. They can infect USBs, like the ones hardware wallets use. If you think any computer whether it is Windows or Mac or whatever isn't backdoored in some way, you are probably wrong. Their fingers are in everything. If chips are being ordered from somewhere, you can bet the Government has their hands in their somewhere. And hiding shit, the amount of 0days they sit on? Jesus Christ... being paranoid isn't even enough. You can bet your bottom dollar, if the US Government wanted my bitcoin, they could almost certainly get to them. Of course it would never be announced in the public. These are unconstitutional most likely. My bet will always be with the Government at the end of the day. They have talent beyond comparison. You will NOT outsmart or beat the US Government at the end of the day. If they really want what you got, they are going to get it, one way or another. That is where my money would be on if it was a gambling game.

So stick with Nano. This is an ever evolving technology and perhaps Nano does become the way to transact back and forth while bitcoin simply becomes a reserve of value. If there are swaps in-between the two it would make it even easier. If you could swap out a little from your reserve currency to exchange day to day at no fees, then perhaps that will be the case. This technology is still so incredibly young that anything could happen. We should be very reserved with our predictions as anything could really happen.

I'd say remotely 0 chance in those circumstances. You never know however I'd say. The best we can do is minimize the risk in every possible way.

Here is some food for thought: 
Coercion is a hell of a thing. Just because something is theoretically sound doesn't mean it always works perfectly in the real world. You will give up anything for the right price.

It coincided with the announcement of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. All crypto started BOOMING then. Probably because BIG names were part of the alliance and gave a giant confidence boost to the crypto ecosystem.

Yes, no, maybe.

This again? You shill this all the time. We get the point. This is becoming spam.

So why are you asking what the easiest way to buy is? You already know how to buy bitcoin. Don't store all your money in crypto, that is insane. Maybe in the future. Crypto can be stolen as well, and there will be no one to save you. At least you aren't responsible for your stolen bank funds. Those are FDIC insured.

Is this the address you had the money in? Because the blockchain doesn't lie. 
If this is indeed your address then you did not have $700 in there yesterday. You have many 0.001 txs leaving your address in September, that is concrete fact. Do you have change addresses or a different address you deposited to? Or is 1Fo6s4sfTy5FNAcptxCsT7SZ6kGnamhP3Q the address you always used?
EDIT: This address only received a total of $100 (estimate at current price) so there is no way you ever had $700 in there.

Or he could just be opsec intelligent and change his username frequently. Who cares how long he's been a Redditor, it has no credence on his intelligence level. Facebook Coin is competition, which is good. Bitcoin has been tried, tested and attacked in hundreds of ways and always survived, it doesn't need to be babied. Shooting down the competition does nothing. If bitcoin really is the future, it will do so with or without FaceCoin in the market. FaceCoin could be great for bitcoin anyway. A means of transacting with each other without bloating the bitcoin blockchain and exposing tons of people to crypto. Remember, bitcoin is a store of value, so perhaps people will transact in ZuckBucks but hold their value in bitcoin. If ZuckBucks can be exchanged for BTC, even better for the ecosystem. Bitcoin can stand on it's own legs.

I personally have never heard them claim that, so I can't speak on that matter. The only thing I know is that the Nano S is several years old and has way less space (memory) in the device. It used to hold more than 3, however with firmware updates (which were to enhance security) the actual firmware took up more space only allowing for less wallets. I am guessing that is what they meant by the line you quoted. The wallet ended up only allowing for 3 because security updates took up more and more space. They could have allowed (and did allow more going back through the years) however security updates diminished the memory capacity. The Nano X, which just released very recently, is blue tooth enabled, has a battery inside that is charged through a USB, buttons are on the front opposed to the top and includes a ton more space (memory) for applications. I hope this answers some of your concerns.

At the end of the day, who cares? If there is truly no use for it then nobody will use it. In a free market everybody gets to decide what to buy, use, trade, etc. Let Facebook make their coin. I for one am interested to see where it takes the crypto space. If it sucks it sucks, don't use it. I won't be using it as I have no need to use it. But Facebook users may find it appealing and transact in it, see crypto is pretty cool and look deeper into bitcoin. Bitcoin is a store of value, I don't think that is what Zuckerberg is looking to do with his funny money. So Facebook users may transact in FaceCoin and realize that bitcoin is a good store of value to hold their savings in. This could expose billions of people to crypto who would otherwise ignore it. This isn't a zero sum game. Both can succeed in far different measures. It doesn't have to be one or the other, winner takes all scenario.

How much bitcoin should you own can be summed up in a single word no matter if you currently own 0.00000001 BTC or 1,000,000 BTC. *MORE*
