I've posted this in the other thread aswell, but here it goes again
It doesn't work, it just doesn't, here you can try it for yourself

So I'm now officially past day 15, where do I ask for the coins :p
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:58:42
great, I'm curious :)
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:09:45
Thought I'd cater to both kind of people :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:38:06
Signed up!
So, I'll be getting my money back now or something? While I'm able to watch these vids for 30 days?

 I've limited to 10000 run cycles atm, but I've seen it bust by very unlikely odds (1 in a 10+mil chance) at longer runs. I'll add some 'store results' functionality for every x number of runs, so you can see what I mean. 
I too used to not believe the math... I wanted to see it for myself, and I did... Once my way and sadly once the hard way. Fortuneatly for me it was with doges, big numbers low values :)

Bitcoin price is ~350 USD, keeps going down a bit, someone says fuck it and sells his 30 000 bitcoins for 300 dollars a piece (yes, thats 9 million, you'll never spend that in your entire life).
Price couldn't go up until 'the rest' bought up all those coins... (again, in a few hours internet strangers bought up +9 million worth of bitcoins).
People still kinda believe in bitcoins, the price held at the 300, while it could've been much worse... (another 'whale' could of said, oh fuck, I'm following at 290 or something)

input some martingale values and spam run, see how it turns out for you in 10000's of tries
I've written this to help me understand the concept of 'you can never win'
I ran countless of million runs upon millions of runs, and in the end... you never win
The less you do this, the more chance you have of walking out with some small gain, but it's eventually the same odds as betting 'normally'

I bought at 18.00
well fuck lol, lucky
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:24:41
Done, lets test!

Next 5 hour prices:
2013-11-21 11:19 - $ 638.01
2013-11-21 12:19 - $ 660
2013-11-21 13:19 - $ 684.7

Looks like I was mixing a cold wallet up with a backup... this explains it a bit more.
So just to run through a practical use. I would create, say 10 offline wallets &amp; print them out. 
Let the first get funded via the public key. Then when I need to use these funds I just 'import' this private key into blockchain, send the sum I need to where I want it and then send the full remainder to the next cold wallet and discard the current one?
Those lok-it's look amazing, even for other uses. I'll get me one, thanks!

Will do, it's no big of a hassle to print a wallet when handling all the funds in the old.
Reading all these bitcoin security issieus makes one a bit paranoid about his security, but I guess that's not really a bad thing. You wouldn't leave your pile of gold in your top kitchendrawer aswell right :)
Thank you so much for this seemingly easy answer, it helped confirm a few crucial things! Glad I wasn't shot down!
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:02:32
That last part was an interesting addition to the rest of the explanations here, thanks
So, but now I'm left to wonder why so many 'thefts' can accur is cold storage is this easy...

For other ATM's you mean then?
Might check it out for a low amount, just to have tried it :)
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:37:36
That's pretty high no?
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:56:02
ha, same here, multiple friends
some random friends are still asking me 'ha how much did you lose, haha, told you', since they keep hearing in the media that it crashed 'more than half'
I mean, I gained x 100 and then lost x2, do the math plz, but by that time they'd allready be confused again
@_date: 2017-05-01 00:02:38
Do you actually believe in a causal link between immoral actions and "bad luck"?
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:34:09
Interesting stuff
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:12:15
I have the same problem. What would be a good alternative? I'm a bit lost as how to armory works, it seems like I can't import seeds i get from armory into things like blockchain wallet.
