I guess you could donate to tax deductible charities with bitcoins and use that to balance out the taxes on your bitcoin profits if the IRS figures out you trade.

Shunt everything you can into a trust, that way if she ever decides to leave you it'll be protected.

They're called con artists because they work to gain your confidence, then once you trust them enough to give them your money they run off with it. When dealing with the wild west of cryptocurrency you've gotta be sharper than the scammers.

What about bitcoin will make the general public choose it over some altcoin backed by a major bank chain?
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:27:04
At least it won't get confused for Thailand's currency like the old bitcoin symbol was.

What if Gavin were to use this to his advantage, slip in some code that would allow him to steal bitcoins? We need more people actively working on bitcoin, just for oversight's sake.

Dogecoin backed a bobsled team somehow. What has bitcoin accomplished?
@_date: 2014-04-14 06:57:21
If anything, we should be less trusting of bitcoin startups than regular companies. Bitcoin has always attracted more than it's fair share of scammers thanks to it's anonymity and frontier natures. They are the reason Bitcoin is less trusted by the luddite naysayers than fiat.
@_date: 2014-05-19 05:19:08
This is a good start but we need to sponsor something that will make headlines like Dogecoin's NASCAR driver.

I'm sure the people who sell at the start of crashes and rebuy the dip are laughing right now. For the same amount of fiat they accumulate more and more bitcoins with each crash. They will be the ones with all the power when bitcoin goes back up to where it was.

You should join GHASH. The free market has spoken.

Good time to sell. Probably a good time to rebuy in half an hour or so.

I'm sure this will prove good for bitcoins over the long term.

Good as this is, I wish Home Depot would accept bitcoins directly.

We really need checks and balances on the dev team. They're not accountable to the community and there's no way to be sure they won't inject malicious code into an update.

AutoModerator's a bad bot all around. One time it deleted a thread I made because the subreddit wants thread titles to read a certain way and mine wasn't 100% correct. It's a wonder people can post on Reddit at all with that thing running around with absolute power.

Why would he crash the market when he could get more money by slowly cashing out his bitcoins as needed?
@_date: 2014-08-04 20:24:22
If the Free Market hadn't wanted them to be  they wouldn't be  Though it does look like Discus Fish might surpass them soon.

That's good because it's generally isolated miners, what bitcoin was originally supposed to be.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:40:13
Not necessarily, but the diminishing payout per-coin from cashing out all at once instead of selling a large chunk and then waiting a few hours for people to buy the price back up is a total rookie mistake, and Ver's no rookie.

Hostile? No. Aggressive, yes.
It has to be aggressive because they ran up against stonewalling complainers when Bitcoin needed to adapt to SatoshiDice's transaction volumes and they'll have to deal with those people again the next time they need to update. The only people against the changes are the ones who put their own personal interests against those of the greater bitcoin community; remember what Spock always said about the needs of the many vs the few.
@_date: 2015-08-17 10:08:35
He has a good point. Bitcoin is more of a proof of concept for cryptocurrency than an actual final product and should be superseded by a new cryptocurrency that addresses those flaws even if it would make bitcoins worthless.
