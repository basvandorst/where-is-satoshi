Most people in crypto only care about the price.  Currently. Which is a good thing. That way more people will hear about crypto. Then, the worthwhile projects will organically succeed.

Make the report public! Then watch those approval ratings rise more. Let the dems chase the next fairy.

Except the part where bitcoin was pretty novel and not wide spread pre 2017. Now everyone knows about it and it would require extreme adoption to see the same gains.
@_date: 2019-03-20 02:25:35
Bitcoin is a speculative risk, rife with infighting and cumbersome hurtles for layperson use. 
Bitcoin is not a lifeboat.
Bitcoin is more like a space ship made of math triangles that frequently breaks apart and is repaired with duct tape, zooming in and out of the atmosphere, randomly duplicating.

I get it! You wont have to because they wont be worth millions! Ha! So true.
@_date: 2019-03-31 20:43:57
I own btc and alts.

Treasury bond 1000000%. Federal reserve note decreases in value with time, gold is speculative, bitcoin is astronomically speculative and bonds mature with low guaranteed interest.

Eh, china government controls anything they want in China, government supreme, the government focused on manufacturing and economic growth through any means required. Not so much for the USA.

You forgot the rest of the meme:
When she finds out you purchased bitcoin back in 2019
She realizes you have money to burn
@_date: 2019-02-09 04:13:04
I get it! It's a cartoon! Cartoons are fake! Good one OP!

Except for the part where bitcoin charges crazy fees, is slow as fuck, forks every week and isnt spent because people hold it as an investment. Except for that, pretty accurate picture.

If you're relatively broke, I wouldn't suggest hitting the casino.

Bitcoin is priced on hype demand, not functionality.
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:24:32
Yeah, you tell them! Only Bitcoin can kill Bitcoin! Complete lack of stability usability and scalability!

@_date: 2019-01-25 03:23:33
good ole shitty bitcoin memes

Yeah but they're trying g to keep their money, so btc would be a bad idea.

What will we do when it hits $5.00 tho
@_date: 2019-01-29 08:02:05
 What's the market cap of wow gold?  
Probably not in the 100 billion dollar range.  
More like a Mountain Dew and a splash of body odor. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 08:22:07
They follow the biggest, easiest fish first. They're not out there searching for the original Runescape currency traders making 1000 dollars a year. They're after the billions and billions of dollars flowing through crypto. They couldn't give two fiddlers fucks about world of warcraft.
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:19:25
I wonder how fast it will be when people use it?
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:07:32
Crypto is too volitile as a whole not just btc. Technology isnt there to build that large of a market cap. Your coin could be hacked and you lose the coins. Why put money into that?
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:39:16
Or monero would instantly become the new bitcoin.

Guys just hodl it's easy 
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:39:01
Just say HODL a bunch and then the price will do things.   
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:29:02
Just tell them to HODL and then the price will rebound.
