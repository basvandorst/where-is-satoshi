What's the ETA on the implosion of onecoin? Bets anyone? It will be a sad day for many, but I'll be the one with popcorn and the line 'told you so'. 
Just think how many friends have sold this crap to each other. All going to loose all the money, and probably their friendships. 
Or are we all missing the picture here and are the illuminati behind it? And are they onboarding the sheeple first to get the masses behind their controlcoin? ;-)

Bitcoin is as immutable as the other chain I guess you're referencing. Thing is, in the other chain people are able to act as a community. I guess both have their merits.

As long as we will trade on centralized exchanges, this will be a problem. No such thing could ever happen on a decentralized exchange, because you would keep your private key, stored on your computer.

Point well made. R3 has come to quite a similar conclusion in a blog some weeks ago. 
"And there is a second reason for this caution: the technology and finance industries collectively “decided” some time in early 2015 that “blockchain technology” was somehow the future of financial services. "
I think it also depends on what your problem is. The beauty of the combination of three aspects you describe, is a perfect solution for a Bitcoin 'problem'. Where one of the problems is 'how to create a worldwide, p2p encrypted transaction network that aggregates value?' 
For banks, their problems are more trivial. Better served by other solutions. Clearly not served by outsourcing a power that currently makes them unique: creating value/money. 
I think it's too early to predict what will be of use where, but it's clear that the tectonic pores are shifting and the FSI will be disrupted significantly.

That was dumb. First: never listen to other people telling you something will go to the moon. Second, never invest more than you're willing to lose. Third never invest money you need. And last, never lie to your wife about using her money.

It probably will. The question is: when? Could be in a year, could be in two years, could be never could be next month. (Unlikely)
The thing is: don't make 
uninformed decisions. If you were a lurker, did you learn enough? And start by buying small amounts at intervals. Not just everything at the same time.
Seems like your loss is manageable though. Good luck!

Did you send it to Coinbase or another wallet? And if so, which one?
@_date: 2016-12-16 06:14:06
Haha thanks. I hope it works out. Good luck!
@_date: 2016-12-12 17:28:55
Agreed. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 11:43:57
And did it show back up in your wallet?
@_date: 2016-12-15 22:48:32
Can you lookup the address you sent from? And check that with block explorer? You should be able to see any transactions going out from that address. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:50:26
Seems to be one of the first actual implementations of blockchain in the real world. Pretty cool Deloitte!
Any word on which blockchain they use for this solution?
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:48:40
Bitcoins don't really exist in the sense of coins on your computer or phone. Like said in earlier comment, you keep the private key. With that key you can sign a transaction that changes the balance of the address the private key give access to. 
This is what is meant by: distributed ledger. It is a ledger with all addresses in existence and their respective balance in bitcoin. 
The private key gives you the right to change the balance of your account (you sign your transaction with your private key) 
@_date: 2016-12-15 22:20:36
So the nice thing about the blockchain is, you can trace the transactions via a block explorer. Are you familiar with that? 
Google it, use the address you sent the ₿ to search with block explorer and see where the ₿ went to...
Make any sense?
@_date: 2016-12-15 21:51:00
The old address should still be linked to your wallet and the 2.9 ₿ should arrive there. A new address is created after every transaction, but the old ones should remain linked and can be used.
Did you receive yet?

I would try and get a hold of multibit support... seems like they have a couple of social media options to approach them on the website...

You can also check out ‘paper wallet’. Those are free and as long as you know what you’re doing, almost as safe.

Ehm Ripple is up 2000% since beginning of this year. So that beats bitcoin in terms of ROI.

The short sightedness of ridiculing this type of innovation is beyond me. 
As a bitcoin enthousiast it would suit you to applaud efforts to strengthen the whole ecosystem. Ultimately his arrogance of ridiculing everything not bitcoin is one of the weak spots of many evangelical BTC followers.

Yes, but the same argument can be used: manipulation of the underlying spot market. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:23:10
They don’t support it willingly. They need to in order to manage their risk on what the market will see as the true bitcoin.
They will keep BTC as BTC though. No changes to the symbols.

Coming from the Netherlands, Gulden is a nostalgic coin, reminding us of pre € times. It's our previous currency in NL. Gulden is a great coin, with a nice app and an active dev community. I believe it will serve a local crypto currency role, and is a good step into crypto for a lot of people in the Netherlands. 
It's easy, connects with iban accounts. I just love it. Also I think that there will be thousands of altcoins, serving different purposes, some will remain viable for longer times than others. I'm not a 'one coin to rule them all' type. 
@_date: 2016-10-08 15:33:48
Ja. Give me your iban and I will send 100 NLG via the app to prove it.

You have a profile that all major corporates are dreaming about. My advice is: first think about what you like, what gives you energy. Then write that down and send it around some companies you know work in the field of your interest. They WILL contact you. (Ok, before you send it around, have some friends you trust review it and give you some feedback and pointers)
Depending on your geographical position, I might be able to set you up with an interview. PM me and I'll see what I can do. :)

If they ever have a coin... It still needs to be mined. So no exchanges trade it, the current price of a onecoin is fiction and set by their marketing/game theory team. If a coin is ever mined, then everyone will want to capitalize via exchange, price will crash and everyone will have lost their money. 
It's terrible how they abuse crypto concepts and terminology to 'hypnotize' uninformed sheeple. I saw a video of a recent event, which was crazy. Just show, no substance, but made big impact with the crowd there. Well, it will be a tough lesson for the people at the bottom. Some people are definitely getting rich, just a very small percentage.
