Understood. From my understanding - you can easily deposit BTC and purchase metals via the platform. From the other perspective (Gold to BTC) Not sure how the fiat bridge would be removed. In order to exchange metals you'd need to purchase it on the platform first. Otherwise you'd need to OTC?
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:11:26
What makes you say that? I'm not a die hard fan of BCH by any means but scam implies a lot. Roger has brought an immense amount of people into the space for both BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:11:22
You can now buy both BCH and BTC with metals. This is a big deal to provide this all in one platform
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:27:16
Think traders will convert using Bitpanda or OTC?
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:40:03
In other words that will supercharge adoption
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:12:55
Really exciting to see this happen. Both Gold and Silver can be exchanged now
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:07:17
They partner with retailers just like ebates and the other traditional reward programs for online shopping
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:30:05
In the interview Alex shares they just partnered with [Hotels.com]( Literally one of the biggest travel sites in the world.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:08:28
You can watch the interview with the CEO interview. He describes how it works in the video also if you don't want to google
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:25:54
Thanks for the comment. (Steve from HackCrypto here) I made sure to do my best describing the platform in the simplest way possible and how metals can be purchased/traded for BTC/assets on the platform. Similar to the majority of other traditional custodial services Bitpanda is using a digital representation. (Deposit EUR, GBP, CHF or USD and trade on the exchange/platform) Withdraws of crypto assets and fiat are live on the platform. How would users deposit or withdraw physical metals from an exchange unless it was in-person/otc/store-front?
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:08:40
Agreed probably won't be going BTC to gold anytime soon lol. I think Bitpanda is the closest to the service you're referring to for purchasing BTC with Gold though. Any idea what the UK service was called?
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:27:36
Got it. They are based in Austria and operate in the UK legally as well. They are the only ones I'm aware of similar to what you're referring to. Will keep an eye out for sure!
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:39:54
For sure. I really like what they're building and Alex has a great vision
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:38:40
Strange... Seems to be working ok. Are you based in the US?
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:39:04
I can't re-create the "unknown error" maybe its from youtube live?
@_date: 2019-11-02 06:46:40
Fun idea to HODL longer than the player next to you
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:27:34
This was a fun exercise that was suggested by the community. Obv bitcoin is not a product but altcoins are competing for market share which makes elasticity of demand more interesting to think about
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:14:45
I've been really interested in the "provably fair" bitcoin casino model for a few years now. FortuneJack seems to be pioneering it quite well. Thoughts?
@_date: 2019-03-01 17:06:52
Really slick extension. Thoughts on this bringing more people to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:13:07
I think this new liquidity model of attaching an exchange onto the pool is brilliant. Thoughts?
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:43:02
Operating 54 countries = big deal
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:39:32
Bitcoin rewards are creepy?
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:13:14
Appreciate it :)
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:07:48
Basically shows how Bitcoin investors are different from traditional investors
@_date: 2019-08-18 00:43:05
Thats awesome man
@_date: 2019-08-23 23:24:30
Robert Beadles is building amazing tech and should be followed
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:24:45
You skipped out before the report data is shared. Bitpanda is the company that created the report. They partnered with GlobalWebIndex
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:47:25
Lolli is working directly with the largest online retailers in the world. Walmart, Jet, Groupon, Hotels.com, etc. The mission is for them to provide a gateway into the retailers to accept peer to peer BTC down the line as adoption grows. Supporting their partnership with the largest retailers in the world banking on even a 50% probability of them accepting BTC to BTC TX in the future beats a using "Rakuten" or other reward programs. Wouldn't you agree?
@_date: 2019-08-06 16:05:08
This is really exciting to have it available in the US for investors. 100% mobile
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:17:33
Eventually will move towards P2P as merchant BTC adoption grows
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:50:36
This was a good experience but highly recommend checking out the encyclopedia section before trying
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:15:32
Who is Richard Lewis?
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:47:42
I see. You could skip through to the middle if needed. Research report was really powerful and even CoinMarketCap just shared it given the massive amount of data they analyzed.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:16:28
Yeah you’re right putting a physical card accepted at merchants connected to a crypto wallet in the hands of millions of people is bullshit. Unfortunately you’ve missed the point
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:45:03
Also excited that Lolli uses a new term/meme STACKING SATS. Clever marketing and everyone can get behind it
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:17:59
That’s awesome!
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:55:47
This was really interesting. Especially the "investor mindset" segment of the report
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:14:23
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:29:44
This wallet is the best-designed wallet out now. Also most importantly you keep your BTC priv keys
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:12:32
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:26:51
Lolli is an exciting project and seamless to use with over 750 partners
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:48:11
Thats awesome you're using it for travel also!
@_date: 2019-06-08 22:56:37
This was an awesome interview and pretty mind bending
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:45:33
$10M bitcoin would take all financial institutions globally to adopt a new "gold standard" to help combat the soon $500 Trillion in global debt.
@_date: 2019-02-05 20:29:36
Bread now BRD has been an OG in the space for a few years now. Was great to sit down and talk about whats coming
@_date: 2019-02-05 22:18:07
BRD implemented Segwit
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:09:25
Summary - Karl Marx would have bitcoin mining rigs
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:04:57
Alongside RVN and XLM
@_date: 2018-11-06 05:17:01
Good feedback and idea. What else would you call it?
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:45:37
This was a great chat with Crypto Love
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:23:44
Great question there are thousands of people every day trying to learn more about crypto on YouTube. So I'd guess the thousands of people globally searching for new &amp; innovative projects each day would be the ones that care. Just a hunch tho
@_date: 2018-11-07 00:52:43
Really great insights from CryptoWendyO after having her phone stolen in Las Vegas at World Crypto Con 2018
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:51:35
The form factor of CoolWallet is a big differentiator  
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:12:21
Taking the mobile first approach is really smart. Not being tethered to desktop (ledger) is a great step forward
@_date: 2019-09-21 21:55:05
These are all offering similar products but its exciting to see new Bitcoin instruments coming into the space

Question about...?
@_date: 2018-07-21 00:52:43
This has to do with Bitcoin being traded on a top 10 exchange which is why it was posted here
@_date: 2018-07-20 21:41:01
AC3 pairing!
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:06:07
What are your thoughts on Bibox?
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:43:46
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:13:43
Shorts being liquidated?
@_date: 2018-07-14 16:06:28
That would be the case if this wasn’t a company blog post that isn’t monetized written by the company.
@_date: 2019-09-22 14:14:00
I agree. its a great project and service
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:43:29
Solid math 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:06:47
Yep. The predication pumped the price a bit.
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:28:29
Solid BTC pairings have been slowly released every few weeks! EOS/BTC, AC3/BTC, BU/BTC, etc
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:05:35
Also you can see our recent HOW BTC will reach $250k video: 
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:46:08
Given Tim’s previous predication of $10k 2017 I’d guess McAfee might be in for a disturbing dinner 
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:41:26
Yes I lost the majority of my BTC in the review... BUT I gained 90% of it back after playing for 3 hours.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:05:53
Your username and this comment together deserve an award...
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:45:45
Also RhinoCoin (RHC) is Tim's new coin .... He did an airdrop after the event to all the attendees 
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:08:16
In 2014 yes he did.
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:48:04
He should do a Mcafee reaction video to this one ...
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:50:44
Yep he is sitting on a big pile
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:44:10
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:35:07
Being serious. He seemed invested in making SM the hub for startups and Blockchain tech.

Bitcoin is less valuable than Tether?
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:39:55
Always RDD
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:39:25
Yeah it was the previous 2017 prediction that peaked everyone’s interest. He is pretty heavily positioned I agree
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:13:07
What company did he endorse?
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:06:12
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:25:42
Probably not 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:17:23
Anything is possible with $100k sponsored tweets
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:20:07
Check the bitcoin wiki for more info on halving  
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:36:34
He was right once before....?
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:23:28
I wouldn't consider 4 years soon. Especially in crypto
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:40:48
How many BTC did he get at the auction?
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:46:43
Mcafee is running a special on tweets. Only $101,000 per tweet
@_date: 2018-04-14 00:39:24
One day... maybe one day 
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:07:36
The mayor was there to basically say he's working with Tim Draper. They also talked about Papua New Guinea... So all over the place basically 
@_date: 2018-04-14 00:38:33
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:44:55
I agree that the halving bull run will pump to $250k 
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:14:02
Good idea. Makerfaire in San Mateo is always fun :)
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:22:54
A social construct. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:05:20
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:09:03
BTC disrupts gold. How do we put a price on a bar of gold? Similar construct  
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:43:01
He literally had a gigantic crystal ball 
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:08:32
Yep he nailed 2017 $10k prediction in 2014
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:20:32
Yeah I try to go every few years. I'm based in San Mateo (the guy who streamed Tim)
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:36:55
Even if he is 80% off on the prediction... it’s a win
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:55:34
I agree but it is still fun to watch him support the community. BTC needs big advocates like Draper
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:12:39
Wow. calling blockchain a fad is pretty moronic 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:10:30
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:42:48
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:36:17
Rumor is he has a team for technical analysis ;)
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:13:03
Lazer maths
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:34:25
The floor would be nice 
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:14:27
The mayor said San Mateo is about to become a tech hub for blockchain. Sounded convincing 
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:44:05
Wow thats actually really cool 
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:44:14
I was an exciting event. Free t-shirts, live music, and food. The mayor of San Mateo was there as well.
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:03:51
Thanks for the support and feedback. wanted to make it short and punchy so people could digest and enjoy learning about some really oldschool and frankly dry topics ;)
I really enjoyed the Bitcoin Standard! Great content
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:02:41
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:19:18
Really cool to see Roger getting involved with bringing institutional investors into the space as a whole.
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:32:25
Comparing everyone's speculations on which markets BTC will disrupt is just that, speculations. Also in regards to the point about currency, in this comparison nowhere did it include currency. This was the scope of payment networks vs gold. Currency comparisons could be a good idea for a separate video though. Thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2019-05-06 14:36:57
Had fun simplifying this down. Any ideas on how BTC will fit into the US using these two perspectives?
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:33:00
Agreed
