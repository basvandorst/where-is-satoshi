Well, threatening to 51% attack the minority chain openly is like Mutually Assured Destruction - if an exchange will start trading the coins, it will lose money, but it will also cost the attacker money. This may be enough to deter people that want to just earn a quick buck and thus not cost anything in the end if the attack never needs to be executed.

Usually when the network agrees on something people don't split the network - mining a whole difficulty adjustment period worth of Bitcoin blocks is very expensive, and even then the difficulty will only drop to the lower-bound (25% was it?), which means unless you have a big mining farm, you won't be able to do much with the fork for awhile.

You will have [relay attacks]( lay people will be confused as to which fork is which, splitting the miners makes both networks weaker, etc. Generally, you don't want to be supporting two networks at the same time.

Sure, you would have some dark markets, but it would be unlikely they would have anywhere as high of volume as an actual exchange. They would be unlikely to sustain a chain or even be able to mine enough blocks to readjust the difficulty. You can't trade coins if you can't move them.

Well, some of the BTC might be at an exchange, but yeah, that would be a nice, straightforward proof.

It's about the [network effect]( not the blockchain network you're on - two different uses of the same word. I mean the network of people using the software, which is the difference between say, Facebook and Google+, or Skype vs Yahoo Messager.
Bitcoin has a network effect - there are many projects using it. Ethereum has a lot of meetups around the world and enough recognition outside of the crypto space to have a decent network effect. Counterparty, not so much - since the Overstock deal fizzled out, I don't think the project is in people's minds all that often.

That's a question of security of the platform, not whether the platform itself is needed. You can move to platforms that don't require mining at all - Ripple, Open Assets, BitShares, etc. and gain the same value proposition - issuing central assets on a decentralized or semi-decentralized system. You don't need millions of dollars of mining to secure loyalty points for a podcast.

Okay, I guess I'm dealing with some outdated data then. Do you know anyone that could go over  and find other mistakes? I'll fix that mistake in my post soon.


I was going off the "trending" tab at  - those don't even seem to register there.


For issuing centralized tokens, Uphold seems to be doing well enough with its Voxels. Yes, it's a stretch, but that's the point of this piece - to show you don't need a platform like Counterparty to accomplish something, but that doesn't mean you might not want to use Counterparty to accomplish it.


You might have lower cost to operate, but in the end it's about the network effect. A platform might be free to run, but it still doesn't mean anyone will use it (I haven't heard anything about  for example since they launched, not to mention anything of value really). When we look at the [Google Trens]( Ethereum is searched more than the more generic term "counterparty", not to mention the specific topic of Counterparty the project.
But at any rate, that's the point of the article - while you might not need Counterparty or Ethereum to do what those projects accomplish, you can still use them if that's what you prefer. If they are a valid solution to your problem, all the power to you.

Counterparty being on Bitcoin is one selling point, for which you pay with the network speed, etc. Depending on what you focus on, you might want to move or stay.
Counterparty [could be easily folded into Ethereum]( or it might be [moved into a sidechain]( when those come to Bitcoin.
Personally, I don't really care where Counterparty is at, since I don't really care about Counterparty in general really.

Hey, [fellow Bitcoin MSc here](
I would personally not focus too much on cryptography for an economics paper. You probably should acknowledge some related characteristics of Bitcoin - fixed supply, irreversible transactions, pseudonymous identities, etc. to give the reader a general understanding of what's going on without getting bogged down with details.
You could focus your thesis on:
- The Bitcoin economics - how it shapes such markets as SilkRoad, OpenBazaar, explore the Backpage effect, inclusive nature of payments, etc.
- Bitcoin as replacement of the current banking - projects like Abra, BitWage, etc. focusing on making payments faster, cheaper, etc.
- [Use of Crypto 2.0s for global economy]( - decentralized asset issuance, exchange, etc.
If you need some more ideas, here is my blog -  ;).

Bitcoin's impact on the banking system is still too small to measure. I know banks, credit unions or even governments are looking into Bitcoin and similar systems (Ethereum, Ripple, etc.), but you won't get any information out of them and at best it's research stage.
You could write about how Bitcoin **could** affect banking, but that would be more theoretical.

There has been at least one instance where two blocks were mined with the same coinbase.

- We will see some major banks adopt and start to publicly use the blockchain technology (a bit like Fidor did awhile back)
- We will agree on a solution to the block size debate
- The blockchain technology will be used to enable easier cross-border payments to and from China, but the project will end up with some regulatory problems due to capital controls or something
- We will see the Bitcoin blockchain used for document notirization, although I don't expect the blockchain proof of existance to be used in court for a few more years
- Price will go to at least $500 due to the block reward halving

Proof of Work is very useful for block generation and security if you don't know anyone in the system. If you're dealing with known entities such as exchanges or banks, you can use other schemes. They can help fix [the frontrunning problem]( lower the costs, remove the block generation variance, etc. There are a few projects looking into the space of permissioned blockchains - Liquid, Eris Industries, Hyperledger, MultiChain, etc. I also think [Tim Swanson]( has written a good number of articles on the subject.

Do you mean [getblocktemplate]( It would be a centralized solution with low variance where small devices would have a higher data bandwidth overhead mining than with the old `getwork` protocol (incread of getting and processing just the header, you would be processing the whole block).

Judging by how things have been in Bitcoin and other blockchains, the ledger probably won't get hacked, but some private keys might get hacked. When that happens, some balances will probably get frozen, some trades will have to be sorted / rolled back, but most likely you won't be able to withdraw any value from the network - those would have to go through the banks anyway. So worst case scenario, a hack of some private keys will disrupt some of the network for a bit and that's about it.

I guess if you act quickly enough post-fork, you could potentially get both BTC and BTX out of a custodial wallet, provided the transactions are formed identically - just copy whatever signed withdrawal appeared on one network and submit it to the other network. If the wallets aren't handled correctly, you might get coins on both networks. Then you go back and deposit coins into the wallet again, make another withdrawal, and hopefully get some more coins on the other chain.

Introduce him to BitPay. This way he would be immune from market fluctuation (good for when the value will be going down).
@_date: 2014-05-24 09:23:57
It means that it's value derives from it's function, rather than what it can be traded for. Paper has small value because you can write on it. Paper bills have value because you can buy things with it. Under some circumstances you can still use paper to trade for other things (barter), but you shouldn't use it as a store of value.
XRPs are mainly used as spam protection in the system. Everyone needs some XRPs to use Ripple. This gives ripples value - they serve a function. That value however, is very small - a user needs about 10 cents worth, so at ~70k accounts now, you would need $7000 between everyone using the system.
Most XRPs are owned by Ripple Labs and the early developers, meaning that they can flood the market at any point and fill about all trades. This is why you shouldn't be using XRPs as a store of value (unless you want to speculate) - there are more ripples that can flood the market than there are in active circulation.

That would work well if the central issuer issued everything everyone used. BTC, USD, silver dimes, man-hours, etc. Moreover, they would have to allow you to trade any currency pairs for one another - you should be able to trade BTC for USD as well as oil or what have you.
With decentralized/distributed systems like Ripple or Colored Coins, each issuer can just focus on supplying what they supply best and rely on everyone else for everything else. For example, Bitstamp can supply good BTC and USD, Ripple Israel can supply Israeli Sheckles, someone else can supply silver dimes and the market can decide what to trade. The network would be bigger than the sum of its parts since there would be more flexibility for markets.

Having attended the Coinfest conference where the the main Ethereum dev was presenting, I must disagree. I have MSc in Computer Science and I know quite a bit about Bitcoin from the tech side, so this is not coming from someone that doesn't know what they are talking about.
First off, [Script]( Bitcoin Script doesn't have all the operations enabled. Since it's not "Turing complete", there are some programs you can't run on it. As of right now in the Bitcoin Script you can't do multiplication, division, boolean logic or a number of other things. As a programmer, that is very limiting. However, since the Script is limited, Bitcoin doesn't have to worry about infinite loops or a lot of other exploits. Bitcoin Script will finish sooner rather than later.
In comes Ethereum. They let you program any script you want. However, now instead of being limited by the king of operations we can perform, we are limited by memory and computation times. To make sure people don't do infinite loops, everyone has to pay for their script execution. If it takes 1 Satoshi per clock cycle or byte we use and we attach 100 Satoshis of a transaction fee, this would be our limit. If our script uses up their allocated amount, it is stopped right there and then.
Next issue is how much data the script can access. If you let the script access everything on the computer, that would be a disaster. However, Ethereum will run in a sandbox. It will have access to data in the blockchain, inputs provided by a transaction and whatever data the script stored between executions (paid for), and that's about it. No access to the wide Internet or local disc.
Now, is all of this needed? I would say yes. It opens up the door to a lot of innovation. Trust-less currency exchanges (creating a script of "if I see a transaction to address A in currency B, I will send the issuer of that transaction A*C amount of currency D"), smart property ("if I don't see a payment of X every month to address A, the license is revoked") and a number of other things that might not be obvious from the start.
So, is what Ethereum is doing novel and useful? Most certainly (although they are not the only people working on that - Ripple is looking into implementing something similar as well). If you are saying that's a bad thing, I think you are missing the point.
And just to note - I am not an Ethereum proponent. I was skeptical when they announced it, now I am curious after hearing more about it.

What is the value proposition of Factom really? It looks like the same same problem can be solved in two ways:
- I take whatever I need to prove, hash it, and submit it in a Bitcoin transaction. It cost me a Bitcoin Tx fee
- I take whatever I need to prove, hash it, send it to you, you merkle tree it and submit that in a Bitcoin transaction. It costs you a Bitcoin Tx fee and it costs me whatever fee you're charging
In other words, you're saving me the difference between a Bitcoin fee and your fee, which at the moment is what, less than a penny? I don't really see a business model in something that saves this little money to anyone.

Well, it depends on how you want to define various terms in your table. You estimate to have 5.3M users on Locks since you use Bitcoin, yet you estimate Colored Coins and Mastercoin that also use Bitcoin as sub 10k. Similarly liquidity on Locks would be centralized and controlled by you as I understand it, with no free market to dictate the price. The liquidity in other systems is defined by the market. You probably would mirror some existing bigger market, which other people could also do on other platforms.
But yeah, if you want to do marketing, do what you feel is honest enough to attract customers. If you want to do an honest comparison, someone external of all of those systems should probably do it.

Some people commenting on the Coinbase announcement did say that if you were offsetting all of your transactions at the moment you make a purchase you would essentially have no tax events since you wouldn't essentially be spending your coins. That might be an interesting implication as well.
But yeah, the service would work just as well for mobile wallets like any other wallet, since it could be implemented completely externally of the wallet. I implemented this for an ATM that I had no access to and could offset any sale it made easy. Heck, I could even estimate how much cash was in that thing based on the current exchange rates.

"Bitcoin and the unbankables"
Many people in the first world are unbankable - banks don't want to do business with them, they can't get a credit card or a loan because of their profession (adult actors), the business they run (medicinal marijuana stores), or their history (bankruptcies). Similar, there is a new strain of unbankables - the Bitcoin businesses. Despite complying with all regulations, many Bitcoin businesses can't get a bank account or have their current ones shut down.
Banks are needed to function in today's world - to transfer money, to hold money, etc. Cutting people off from the banking services is like cutting them from the utilities.
Since Bitcoin is an inclusive technology, it allows the unbankable to do everything the banking sector offers without the fear of being shut down, without the fees or red tape. This should be the core of the story - talking about how Bitcoin solves the problems of the unbankables and how banks impose their agenda on the money.
@_date: 2014-05-05 20:03:00

Ripple is more useful when there is some trust between the parties or the parties and a third system. Bitcoin is more useful when there is no trust.
Ripple is vulnerable if Gateways go down or turn malicious - then your money becomes worthless. Bitcoin can survive Exchanges going down or turning malicious - you don't need them to hold your BTC.
I personally see Ripple as a compliment to Bitcoin rather than a replacement.

I think you need to be more explicit on your website as to the process in which the cash in merchant's hand ends up on the exchange to be converted to Bitcoin again for when the customer buys the coins. It's all well and good to sell BTC for Euros, but since you're dealing with two exchanges that only take USD, then there is much more to the equation...

Well, whoever writes the proper response can word it however they chose. The point is that things that are legal to sell are being restricted from being sold by banks. Bitcoin is there to facilitate such legal trades.
As for reserve currency, that's where I see Bitcoin in the future. It fits perfectly into that role, so might as well be honest - 20 years is enough to make the transition.

Hmm, I guess we would have to think about it.
It might be the best for you to start advertising yourself as a team that accepts Bitcoin donations - put a word our here on Reddit as well as around your local Bitcoin meetups. You might be more valuable promoting a local Bitcoin business than a subreddit. Perhaps try organizing some event at one of their venues or something like that and see how many people you can bring.
From what you are describing, the events you are attending are rather small, so the extra exposure we might get from them might not have an impact on our subreddit, but on a local scale they might be more noticeable.

Say I buy something in person at a shop accepting 0 confirmation payments and attach a 0 fee. The payment propagates through the network and I get my purchase.

The network goes "hey, this tx has some fees, best put it into a block!", the double-spend goes into a block and I have both the money and my purchase.

In that case, you can add Bitcoin to pretty much any of the network and have a similarly good product. Mastercoin + Bitcoin, Colored Coins + Bitcoin, or even Ripple + Bitcoin through a [Bridge]( The benefit of a Crypto 2.0 system like Ripple however, is that I don't have to use BTC or XRP to trade between, say, Bitstamp USD and RippleSingapore XAU - I can trade them directly for one another. And since it's all on one ledger, it is sharing a common interface that lets me send anyone my underlying assets, not just people that are registered with the same company.

GPU mining is on the way out - you can still mine some altcoins with it that use scrypt (Dogecoin, Litecoin), but it might be on the way out soon. As for ASIC mining, it's a specialized industry. You have to ask yourself whether you want to do this as a business or not. If you have a doubt whether you're committed, you probably shouldn't be mining.

Hey, I just stumbled upon this feature and I think it's great. I think that if you refined it a bit further it would be really useful to the crypto community. Here is the functionality I think you still need:
- Allow users to specify any number of addresses for any currencies
- Allow those addresses to be searchable
- Allow user's profile to be fetched by an address
This way when people would be sending money to various addresses, they would be able to see the associated Gravatar and add a human face to the address.

One of the people that worked Open Transactions visited us during one of our [decentral meetups]( Vancouver was also the place Monetas originally started as far as I know. So lets see if I remember this correctly...
Monetas system is working and is aiming for business solutions.
Open transactions are apparently functional, but if you're not a programmer good luck using any of it. Apparently the system supports not only all the financial operations available (sending money, exchanging it, shorting, futures and so forth as I understand it), but they also include a scripting language to do anything else you want. Since the validating servers can access any data they need, OT might be more flexible than Ethereum might be with its sandbox system.

You could just accomplish that at a wallet level with some extra settings. Say Blockchain implemented an easy tick box in your wallet that would default to adding extra output to each transaction to an address you specify - savings or charity or whatever. You don't need to change the protocol, and the Bitcoin Core is probably not the wallet to put that in initially. You should hit up Blockchain, Mycelium, Pheva, etc.

I am not sure if it supports a distributed exchange like Mastercoin or Ripple. It might have problems implementing atomic trades using just Bitcoin transactions. With 10 minute confirmation times, the exchange would be rather slow and inefficient.
Other than that, I am going on Vitalik's explanation of how hard it is to do simplified payment verification with CCs or Mastercoin.
@_date: 2014-08-09 01:42:13
No, not really.
Locks appear to let you peg your value to certain assets. That's great, but what if I want to get the underlying assets instead of getting my BTC? Pegging to gold is good for price speculation, but not when you want to withdraw gold.
Not to mention that the innovation is limited to one company. In systems like Ripple, Stellar, Mastercoin, etc. the network grows whenever someone plugs in new currencies. Locks have to implement everything themselves.
The asset list also appears outdated. Take Ripple for example -  . XAG, XAU, LTC, ILS, JPY, GBP, EUR, CNY, CAD, USD and BTC, not to mention smaller things like DIM or XNF.

~~What I think Gox should be doing with handling transactions:~~
- ~~Log deposits by TXID as they come in - this is what they are doing now AFAIR~~
- ~~Credit user accounts when given TX has 6 confirmations~~
- ~~If someone says they sent the money but Gox didn't receive it, they need to provide the TXID. Gox checks the TXID on Blockchain, sees it is not there, rejects the claim.~~
~~It's not really that hard.~~

I don't know whether Colored Coins have a distributed exchange up and running yet. I doubt they support on-the-fly currency exchange during payment, nor that currency exchange going over multiple currencies would be executed as an atomic transaction. Since their speed is limited by the speed of the Bitcoin network, they can't reach the speed of full confirmation in 5-10 seconds. From a technical standpoint, Ripple blows Colored Coins out of the water.

So I developed this concept of a service that lets you pay for transactions that are in a limbo due to too low transaction fees. The service lets you put bounties on your unconfirmed transactions that will be paid out to the miner that puts your transaction into a block.
At the moment this is still a work in progress - no pool is supporting the project yet. I just wanted to let everyone know that something like this exists so we can determine how much interest there is in this project. If you want to use this service in the future, ask your pools to support this and spread the word ;).

Here are some advantages:
- 5 second full confirmations (no 6 confirmations, no mining, no blocks. 5 seconds ledgers, one ledger is enough to completely secure transaction)
- Create any currency you want (USD, BTC, oil, carbon offsets, whatever)
- Trade between any currency pair (Dogecoin&lt;-&gt;carbon offset trading? no problem)
- Trade currencies on the fly while you make payments (you have BTC, someone only accepts USD, no problem, you send BTC, it gets exchanged, and the recipient receives USD. All in 5-10 seconds)
- In the future they might support turing-complete contracts (like Ethereum)
AND you can do all of that without touching XRPs for anything but transaction fees (10 cents of XRPs should last you a lifetime).

You can use Ripple without touching XRPs personally. A few Gateways will give you enough XRPs for you to run your account for a lifetime. After that you can stick to using USD, BTC, LTC, oil or whatever else you fancy without touching XRPs.
Speculators buy XRPs and hope the price will go up. They are pretty much worthless to the Ripple ecosystem. Investors invest in the development of the software or services (for example, Google Ventures invested in Ripple Labs, not XRPs), making the system better.

Probably since changing the transaction essentially creates a double-spend. If there is a double-spend conflict, only one of the transactions is transmitted. This means data might propagate slower through the network. Also, if the transactions are bloated up, there might be some issues with including them in the blocks and so forth.

In order for a block to be valid (among a few other criteria) all transactions in a block need to be valid. If a block contains invalid transactions, it is disregarded as invalid.
As for "illegal" transactions - double-spends against transactions that are not in block yet are still valid - that's called a Finney Attack. Including illegal content into blockchain is also valid as long as it doesn't break any other rules (for example, see [my master thesis]( on including an [illegal number]( into blockchain as an example).

From [the definition](
"A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator, an individual or organization, pays returns to its investors from new capital paid to the operators by new investors, rather than from profit earned by the operator."
Bitcoin is:
 - Not an investment, it's a currency
 - Not run by any operator, individual or an organization. It's decentralized like gold
 - Does not pay ANY returns, it appreciates in value
All in all - Bitcoin is like gold - it has value because it's useful, people want it, and there is a fixed amount of it.

At the moment it looks like the only way to perform a crowdfunding.

While I think adding flairs in general would be a great addition to the subreddit, address flairs are a bit redundant due to ChangeTip. You can already tip anyone on Reddit with it. The address flairs would only be useful if someone that doesn't have ChangeTip wanted to tip someone, which might not happen too often. Tipping is not a strong part of the culture anymore and even on services like bitcointalk where people can put any address in their profile I'm not sure whether people are tipped all that much.

- Ripple is not Bitcoin 
- Ripple Labs owns most of the XRP, thus creating a Democles Sword above the entire network
- Ripple was released as a closed-source application
- Ripple is based on credit, rather than debit. You can create an arbitrary amount of tokens on the network
- Ripple is less focused on anonymity than Bitcoin
- Ripple Labs is focusing on being pro-regulation, therefore putting Bitcoin in a negative light and possibly forcing the industry to over-regulate
- Ripple is focused on working with the banks rather than abolishing the banking world
- Ripple Labs got fined by FinCEN
- Ripple Labs got a good amount of funding (rather than the money going to "a bitcoin company")
- The network validators are mostly run by Ripple Labs, thus making the network more centralized

If they are holding XRPs, they are speculating on its value. Bitstamp is first and foremost a Bitcoin exchange, that is not affected at all.
They are also a Ripple Gateway. The price drop might mean they will get either more popular (people want to get into Ripple and buy some cheap XRPs with their USD and BTC perhaps?), or less popular (people got burned with XRP price and don't want to use Ripple anymore).
I don't think the amount of money they are earning through Ripple is significant enough to affect their exchange business. Again, if they are holding significant amount of XRPs or BTCs, it would be mostly speculation on the price of both.
@_date: 2014-05-25 09:31:40
I guess gateways should be asking Ripple Labs to be able to run their own validator nodes that would be treated just like the validators ran by Ripple Labs. This way the validation process would get more and more distributed with time.

Actually, it's a combination of the computing power and the amount of confirmations, not the block speed. While one 10 minute block is better than one 1 minute block, ten 1 minute blocks are stronger. Here is a paper on this:
This is essentially due to the fact that you are multiplying probabilities, not adding them. If you have 1 in 100 chance of creating a block, that is as secure as having to create 2 blocks in 1 in 10 chance.

Conferences might not be for everyone, I agree. That being said, a lot of people can benefit from them. For example for this conference:
- You had 3 artists performing live. If people liked their music, they will most likely see more exposure and more sales
- You had a few business people that are starting to get into Bitcoin. They probably learned a lot and will be putting some of their capital into the space soon
- There was a pro-Bitcoin politician networking with people. He can learn more about what the space cares about and get the word out for himself
- There were about 5 different Bitcoin-focused media outlets there. Each one of them will most likely cover the event and keep their viewers informed about what's happening in the space
- You had small startups promoting themselves through booths to get the word out. If it wasn't for the conference, I wouldn't know about Fibonacci, College Cryptocurrency Network, SovereignBTC, SAE, etc. and now I can name them off the top of my head.
- During the conference you could connect with a number of Bitcoin higher-ups, like Andreas, Brock Pierce, Patrick Byrne, Jeff Garzik and so forth. If you had a good thing to pitch to such people, you were more likely to be able to have their attention during the conference than just by sending them an email
- I know that one or two speakers were asked to talk Bitcoin for some business companies. Those speakers make their living doing such talks, so they earned their next paycheck by speaking at this event for free
So while I agree that going to conferences is not for everyone, there are enough people that are interested in such events that they are worthwhile.

Spam prevention. If a transaction is free, you can't stop spam (see: emails). If it costs something to send money / information, there is less spam (see: traditional mail).

Lets see...
Merkle tree lets you combine many hashes into one hash in a predictable way. So when you have 16 transactions, you combine their hashes in pairs. You get a tree with 16 hashes, then 8, 4, 2 and finally 1.
When you have coloured coins, you need to prove that a transaction was a part of a block as I remember. It's called [simplified payment verification]( You present a transaction with a hash, and all of the relevant nodes in the merkle tree that hash was a part of, until you get to the root. Then you point to the block header the root was in and you have proven that the transaction is in the block. Instead of having to relay the whole block (which can be a megabyte big), you only need to transmit the header (much smaller), the transaction itself and the branch of hashes.
[This video by Vitalik]( explains the concept pretty well as far as I remember (relevant part should be somewhere around 10:30).

As to why Bitcoin? Since it is the most adopted and has the most support behind it. 99% of the altcoins are copies made by people that don't even understand the protocol and couldn't support the code by themselves. There are MANY more millions that were poured into building an infrastructure for Bitcoin and no other altcoin can hope to get that kind of support any time soon.

The problem is, Bitcoin Protocol is not about everyone doing their own thing and the network being cool with that. The Protocol is about everyone agreeing on what to do. If you disagree, you create a fork - you have your version of reality, and everyone else has theirs. If you are in the majority, you can mine new blocks and spend them everywhere. If you're in minority, you are basically on your own and can't spend your coins with anyone.
If you want to create a hard fork and make everyone else use it, go ahead, but I doubt anyone would trust a fork from a 0 day Reddit account over the person that has been developing the Bitcoin code for years.

Here is my general take on the matter:


Overall activities have been positive - US' government has mostly let Bitcoin grow without much hurdles which is good. That being said Fincen's stance that Casascius' Coins creator needs to register as a money transmitter can be seen as a step in a wrong direction. Similarly, there is no clear cross-state law regarding virtual currency exchanges - it is near impossible for a startup to get all the necessary licenses to operate in the whole country if you want to strictly obey all regulations.


As with any emerging technology, there are gaps in the law that need patching and old laws that need revising. For example, if Bitcoins come from an illegal source but are accepted by a merchant unknowingly in good faith, could that merchant's profits be seized due to Bitcoin's traceability? Read more [here](




Cheap an easy way for anyone to accept online payments (for example, legal gun manufacturers or cannabis sellers may find it impossible to do online sales, with Bitcoin their business can grow online), cheaper transactions for merchants (lower fees, no chargebacks, etc), really easy and cheap international money transfers. Overall, Bitcoin can speed up global commerce and lower the barrier to entry for anyone wishing to accept payments.


It almost always is related to a media hype cycle. In 2011 a lot of people were introduced to Bitcoin for the first time. In April of 2013, it was a combined effect of Cyprus bank seizures, a few notable places starting to accept Bitcoin and so forth. In fall of 2013 - first Bitcoins started to be traded in China.


There are many solutions, like BitPay, that eliminate currency volatility risks for merchants. Price volatility will decrease as the currency adoption increases. Once Bitcoin is as established as say, Internet of 2000s, the volatility should go down.


Ripple, it is the only possible game changer beyond Bitcoin. It is a decentralized currency exchange, a way to issue personal IOUs and trade across different currencies seamlessly. From Bitcoin-like currencies, Namecoin is worthy of mention but to being a decentralized domain name service, but that's more a technical innovation rather than a concern for regulations. Other currencies work basically like Bitcoin and offer little if anything beyond what Bitcoin does and is.


Either Bitcoin or a Bitcoin-like currency will most likely be the world's reserve currency, or be on the way to become that. With the era of asteroid mining precious metals may not suffice, and perfect mathematical scarcity of Bitcoin-like currencies will be unbreakable at least until quantuum computers grow significantly from what they are capable of doing today.


Let innovators and startups experiment with the technology in a supportive fashion (don't impose laws that stifle creativity without necessity), don't force an old law onto a new function unless it follows the spirit of the law (Cassascius' case), revise old laws to make innovation easier.

When you connect to the Bitcoin network, you connect to nodes that have an open port and accept outside connections. You want to have at least 8 of them from different geographical regions (based on IP). The more nodes you can chose from, the less likely they are to be malicious - tracking who relays what data, where do you connect from and so forth. It's a bit like a TOR network - the more nodes there are, the more resilient the network is to attacks.

Well, for Bitcoin and similar currencies non-fungibility can be forced by the community, or by the governments (if they decide that if you own some tainted coins you are in essence in possession of something used in a crime and they are to be forfeited). Hopefully that won't happen, but you never know what dumb idea someone might have at some point...

Bitcoin is a system that lets you send and receive bitcoins in a very secure and anonymous way. That's good if you want to use bitcoins, but some people like using other things.
Ripple is a system that lets you send and receive tokens for anything in a very secure but less anonymous way. You can send people USD, BTC, gold, oil or whatever you want. You can also trade between anything in a network-wide exchange.
Keep in mind that Ripple relies on trusted gateways to let you redeem the funds. 1 BTC from MtGox is not as good as 1 BTC from Bitstamp for example.
Or to make it simpler - Bitcoin is like digital gold (trade in one currency securely), Ripple is like PayPal (trade in anything).

People trust Gavin and the core developers to handle things responsively, since they have been doing that for years. If there is uncertainty as to what needs to be done, the miners can vote with their hashing power (which has been done before with one of the BIPs). If you want to change how the protocol works, you need to convince the developers as to why your choice is better. Posting on Reddit as to why the Foundation and Gavin are wrong won't accomplish much.
I guess your best option is to look for some dev channel.

If you use a wallet like Blockchain, you don't need special API keys for Blockchain to listen to the addresses. A general purpose watch-only address or some other polling mechanism that checks transactions for a given address.
If you can run your own server, it's not that hard to implement - you just need Bitstamp API and some basic communication with Blockchain. Third party servers could be used as long as Bitstamp API key is only for trading and the service is trusted.

I would propose keeping those funds around and sponsoring a few bigger events like Starcraft tournaments. We could probably aim to be spending say, 1BTC per every notable event, or maybe going heavier for one or two events.
If we make it known that we would be willing to pitch in some money to say, e-sports events, there will probably be plenty of people wanting to take that money as prize money. We could work again with TotalBiscuit perhaps (maybe being the main sponsors of some game other than Starcraft, say, Bloodbowl, Dota, Heartstone).

There might be room for both, under the right circumstances.
Decentralized currencies like Bitcoin can be "the hard money" - used as a baseline for settlement when there is no other option between the parties, like gold is nowadays.
Centralized currencies can be "the soft money", and can encompass a lot more than just traditional fiat - asset backed currencies, shares, stocks, futures, debt, etc. They can be used to denote everything else that Bitcoin cannot, as long as it's useful.
So while Bitcoin is the money of the Internet, there might be some development that create the Internet of money - perhaps sidechains, perhaps [some other Crypto 2.0s](

Blocks have value, but they have no cost to create them - similar to proof-of-stake blocks. The big question is - how does one determine which fork in the chain to follow? Do you follow the longest chain? Are there some validators that reach a consensus on which chains are valid? How does a person just joining the network know which chain to trust?
All of those problems have been solved in Bitcoin, but ChainDB doesn't appear to have a solution in place.

So I'm guessing you're using a scheme similar to shamir's secret sharing, where you hold the encrypted root of an HD wallet, as well as have one part of the password, while the user has the second part. You only release the partially decrypted seed to your users after they use 2FA from their phone. All in all, it doesn't sound at all more secure than what is currently available - it looks like if your system gets compromised, what stands between the attackers and the private keys is the users' password...

You can create a legitimate transaction (6+ confirmations) that says, puts money in an exchange, change your LTC to something else, withdraw, then reverse that transaction and spend the same LTC again.

"Smart contract" is a name used for "a script that is executed in a decentralized way", roughly speaking. It's not a contract between parties, but it's a computer script.
We're not talking about legal enforceability of contracts between parties, but the fact that you couldn't stop a decentralized program that controls money based on possibly illegal rules that a decentralized network like Ethereum would be forced to execute.
So a more descriptive name might be "smart, decentralized script".

Lets see... The biggest potential problem I see with ChainDB is that it doesn't punish forks (the "nothing at stake" problem). One can easily create multiple branches and put them in the same Bitcoin block, creating a few versions of alternative history that coexist. To solve that problem, you would need to somehow denote which chain of blocks is the true chain - perhaps through a consensus mechanism used by Stellar. Adding punishments for forking might not work too well since ChainDB doesn't have its own token and the Bitcoins at stake might be moved out before some fork surfaces.
If it is just meant to be a private tool for companies to use for their own sake and say, bind it to a specific address for accountability ("address 1XYZ is our official ChainDB address and if we change it, something went wrong"), the approach works fine. For a global, decentralized network, it needs some improvements.

Cryptocurrencies are cheaper and faster to operate. So I can deposit my fiat at a gateway's bank once and then use their crypto IOUs to operate in fiat in a more convenient way - sending any amount of IOUs to anyone in the world in a few seconds, rather than weeks at a time. This is one of a few reasons why cryptographic fiat money is better than fiat money at a bank.

Bitcoin and similar issues can make the physical vendors interoperable, thus creating more competition for the services and breaking up the price into its essential components - you can charge people for deposits, withdrawals and transfers separately, rather than in an all-inclusive model.

The entirety of turing completeness also include what Bitcoin script currently does. So lets just throw out conditional statements while we're at it and just make all Bitcoin scripts "op checksig verify".


Actually, even if you'd take every reddit vote in a month and wrap that inside a separate Bitcoin transaction, you could almost fit it into 1MB/10 minute blocksize. If you're talking projects like Wikileaks or say, censorship-free blogging, there can be plenty of counterparty risk - imagine being a whistleblower or dissident blogger in China. Those two would benefit from the decentralized nature of the project by being able to submit their data straight into the network, rather than going through a third party or a centralized server and possibly compromising their identity.
Just like Counterparty offers censorship resistance for tokens and currency, projects like Ethereum offer censorship resistance for software scripts.
All in all, people "might not need" Counterparty, or they "might not need" Ethereum, but that doesn't mean that those aren't "a solution" to problems people face. There might be other ways of doing the same thing, but they are quite straightforward and that's good enough. It would be like saying that with the advent of Go, Python or C or PHP is unnecessary since it is a more efficient programming language and it compiles fast, or that we don't need Go since we already have programming languages that do the same thing. If you don't want to use Ethereum, you don't have to try to sour it for other people that want to use it.

If the illegal script was a part of a distributed ledger like Ethereum, it would run on everyone's computer. You would need to shut everyone down. Similarly how [the Bitcoin ledger is storing an illegal prime]( - it's a piece of data that can't be easily removed from the blockchain.
If we had a system like [Codius]( the various machines that run the code would first of all have plausible deniability - they provide an open platform to run software and don't expect to run illegal software, so they can't be held completely accountable. They would probably have to shut down the software after getting a takedown request, but it takes a few servers running Codius over the darknet or in jurisdictions that don't give a damn and the program will persist.
Moreover, probably before the program would be taken down, it would've been copied already and if needed be could be re-uploaded over and over again by many people. Keeping track of the software would be very hard, especially if you use code obfuscation.
All in all, it is possible that with the advent of Ethereum and Codius we will see software that will be able to run as long as it has the money to pay for itself. It might become impossible to take it down over time, and as stated in my blog post, we will soon see the unmovable policies collide with the unstoppable innovation.

Any subreddit has the responsibility to remove malicious links. Some people view XT and similar clients as malicious, I personally don't share that idea.

Not really - more nodes can be started as needed in case there is a need for them. Me running a node today won't affect any decision about hard forking tomorrow. Hard forks aren't introduced by a majority of nodes running one code or the other - everyone can choose which sides of the fork to use if they are both maintained. To prevent network split, you need as much support from the miners, as well as the community, exchanges, wallets and everything.
More nodes help with transaction / block propagation (throughput, but not speed), network resilience to unconfirmed transaction censorship, ddos attacks, regional network failures, higher untraceability of transactions, etc., not "centralization of power".

Well, some people will enjoy gambling for the experience of it, others might play on their computer and not mind that much. If we're talking about games like Keno or lotto, the gaming experience might not change much from how it is nowadays, but we might eliminate [some fraud in the process](
But if we're talking about the merits of turing complete scripting - which parts that Ethereum introduced do you think are superfluous?
The Bitcoin script for example [seems to be lacking loops]( Pretty much every programmer does use loops on regular basis - sorting and repeating the same action multiple times are the most basic examples of that. Loops would for example enable automated [crypto-based universal basic income]( as well as say, refunding people's money automatically from some Kickstarter contract.
Similarly, Bitcoin lacks the concept of persistent variable storage. This for example makes it impossible to create a straightforward whitelist - say allowing only vetted traders to trade financial assets to appease the local law. Similarly, we have to interpret custom transactions externally to figure out if they did anything or not - it lacks the "meta" data indicating what the transaction did [like you would see in Ripple]( This is fine for how Bitcoin is right now - either transaction goes through or not, but not enough for more complex transactions (say, partial payment).

Yes, but you want to get rid of "The ENTIRETY of turing completeness.", which also includes Bitcoin script (as a subset of operations needed). Bitcoin script plus loops plus possibly something else is a turing complete language. So if you're saying you're against the entire notion of turing completeness, you should also be against Bitcoin script. Otherwise, you should be saying "I'm against loops" or something like that.


[Last month]( Reddit had ~30M votes, which is about 10 votes per second. Bitcoin can handle 7 TPS. Add segwit and the votes would get quite small in comparison.


[TOR seems to be getting less secure by the minute]( and anonymous email servers can be [honeypots](


Saying something is more secure doesn't mean the other thing isn't secure at all. Ethereum might be less censorship resistant than Counterparty, but it's still more censorship resistant turing-complete scripting environment than the alternatives for running turing-complete languages.


Valid criticisms? Saying `Ethereum is full retard` is not criticism, it's an ad-hominem.

Because cryptographic math:

a is your private key, G*a is your public key, b is the solution private key. Since you never disclose your private key, only you know it. However, people can still compute the solution from your public key. Only you know the private key, so only you know a+b.

I agree that the first part of the event was a bit disjointed. If you went around cherry-picking, you could find:
- Bitcoin co-op (same table as Dogecoin, but their half was unmanned most of the time...)
- Bitbulls promoting Coinkite (on the same table as Sovereigns)
- ParadoxBTC - they were nicely dressed and promoting their Bitcoin-focused company
- An artist selling their wares for BTC and Doge
- Doge promoter
- Founder of the Sovereign Exchange - the guy selling the "coins of questionable value". He is relevant to the community since his Exchange was partially acquired by GreenBank and it will be expanding to accept BTC soon.
- The Podcast tent, where a lot of people were interviewed about Bitcoin
But I agree, mixing Bitcoin, alt currencies and the arts and crafts group was rather weird.
The other events were better. I attended the Exchange event, where Quadriga set up their Lamassu, Bitbulls sold BTC/LTC for silver and you had a lot of interesting people hanging out and talking about Bitcoin. Among them was Anthony from Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, we also had the creator of Ethereum and so forth.
I also stopped by the Mining event, where you had Robocoin and Bitcoiniacs, companies selling mining services, another company selling mining equipment, and some presentation of small asic miners.
The first even could use more focus, while the other two were a lot better.

Programming languages require a few elements to be turing-complete. There is no "turing complete part", it's like saying that "a motocycle without the motocycle part is a bicycle" - you're not specifying which part you don't want.
So which part do you think is unnecessary?


Never said it wasn't. Just giving an example of what is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum.


You're mixing the issues. That's like saying "who needs HD video streaming? The Internet can only handle so much bandwidth" - it's the difference between optimizing the backend vs. what you use the backend for.
As to who needs this, here are two examples from my blog - [decentralized Reddit]( and [the dark wiki](
Decentralized Reddit postulates that whoever control the social media, be they reddit or subreddit moderators, can and will censor content on it. Therefore we need a decentralized solution that has storage for posts / votes, has a concept of money tied to it (spam prevention), and nobody controls (can't be on a central server).
Dark Wiki is similar - you have a website with sensitive information (like WikiLeaks) that nobody can take down. Since the information is embedded in a blockchain, you know nothing was omitted ([negative proof]( and modify access to the wiki itself is curated through a decentralized web of trust (also stored on the blockchain). You again have the concept of storage for the edits, money for bounties, proof of burn and spam prevention, and nobody controls it, so once again it can't be on a centralized server.
So, since your argument seems to be "who needs that?", let me retort with the same question - who needs Counterparty? It's a bloat on the Bitcoin blockchain ("we're worried about the size of the UTXO pool" - same goes for block size), it is a decentralized network for the creation of centralized tokens, and all in all it could be replaced by centralized / semi-centralized servers like Open Transactions, which would improve the transaction speed, reduce cost and so on. Who needs Counterparty at all and what for?

Hmm, it might be similar to OpenTransactions with centralized notaries only keeping track of the last receipt for each person which is enough to prove one's balance.

Well, the question then becomes - did the initial factor for the 2-3x rise was responsible for the entire rally by itself, or was it bolstered by the Cyprus crisis? It could've been two events that bumped the price and overlapped one another.
What would you see as the catalyst for the bubble?
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:36:33
I saw that earlier today. My guess is someone is trying to pump alts with the word "Bitcoin" in it to try scamming some people that don't know better that those are actual bitcoins or Bitcoin forks.

On one hand, it allows us to forge our own path independently, on the other hand, we don't have a impasse breaker when we need one (like the block size debate). Only time will tell which approach will be better in the long run.

The Bitcoin market seems to be made up in large part by speculators. If they expect the price to go up, it might become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Similarly, a lot of miners nowadays have a big upfront cost in form of buying hardware and warehouses to house it, so they might be less flexible in just dropping out of the market.
But yeah, you can't really tell for certain with Bitcoin - it goes where it pleases.

You do realise that in order to get there, Bitcoin would have to go through similar development as Ethereum and people would get similarly hurt? It is understandable that when you innovate, you will run into serious problems, but someone has to pave the path.
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:51:17
Looking at the current problems with a simpler hard fork, we probably wouldn't release anything at all in the near future. The thing is, it isn't really Ethereum that failed, but the smart script built on top of it. This is similar to blaming Bitcoin for bringing down MtGox with malleated transactions - it's related, but in the end it's the custom code that failed, not the Bitcoin protocol.

If XT overtakes Core and becomes the undisputedly dominant Bitcoin network, it will become the focus of the subreddit. If both networks coexist for a long time, it might be a problematic decision.
@_date: 2015-08-16 05:07:13
I think the reasoning is that it protects the consumers that aren't Bitcoin-savvy from mistaking BitcoinXT for Bitcoin. Same as you don't direct people new to Bitcoin to look into Dogecoin since "it's basically the same thing only faster".

Only hard forks that are not part of the "main chain". If a hard fork occurs and the networks switches over to that chain (say, when multisig was introduced), that is the main chain. If someone creates a fork that goes deliberately against the rest of the community, that's pretty much an altcoin.
It's a hard topic to discuss since we're talking about consensus of a decentralized system.

If someone came in and proposed a 20MB hard fork of Bitcoin, would that still be Bitcoin? If we had 10 other people come in and each propose a different fork, would they all still be Bitcoin? What if someone changed the mining algorithm, the block speed, etc.? At which point do you draw the line?

BitcoinCore is the standard client to which all other clients have to comply. If there is a discrepancy between BitcoinCore and any other client, it's that client that gets patched. Even if the users don't use Core, it's still what runs the network.
If someone asks "how do you buy Bitcoin?" you don't direct them to where they can buy Dogecoin. Same with BitcoinXT when the fork occurs.

You can see it as slippery slope, but you can also see the opposite as special pleading - BitcoinXT should be treated differently because it is ran by Gavin, therefore it should be exempt from the rule.

It's not my opinion, I'm just relaying some of the reasoning why it is considered an altcoin for the moderation purposes. I didn't make that decision, nor do I agree with it, but I comply with the decision that was made.
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:25:55
BitcoinXT is not like any other current alt-coins, but it doesn't mean we won't see more alts like it if it gets any traction. What if LukeJR decides to create his own chain afterwards that blocks all spam transactions, Mastercoin and Counterparty? What if someone creates a chain that gives them extra million coins? What if there are a hundred more chain forks? Would you consider them all on-topic for this sub?
Believe me, I'm also not a proponent of BitcoinXT being removed, I'm just explaining the reasoning behind the decision made by other mods.

I guess something like  only for coloured coins would be useful?

That's rather uncalled for.
[He was duped by Craig]( - we all make mistakes, and he admitted to making that mistake.
Claiming that he is [shilling]( would imply he is getting paid to promote it or has other ties to the project that he is not disclosing. It seems that nobody can support one project or another without being labelled a "shill".
Blaming Gavin for Satoshi leaving is also putting too much blame on him. It seems that Satoshi didn't want the project to get too much attention. Sooner or later it was inevitable that some governments would take notice. If it wasn't Gavin, it would've been someone else at some point.

My guess is Satoshi was "a programmer type", so he probably would be ill equipped to deal with lawyers, public attention and being investigated by the government. Craig on the other hand seems to believe he can sue anyone and win, basks in attention and appears to have enough money to afford good lawyers to protect himself. By claiming to be Satoshi, he's trying to earn credibility that he can capitalise on, which could net him more than what he'd spend to keep himself safe.
Then again, since he antagonised a large group of smart people, there is a lot of scrutiny going his way, which means he might slip up and be caught in a lie...

If it's like the old on-blockchain micropayment channels, it will only reduce the amount of transactions that take between the same entities multiple times over some period of time (say, buying a few beers at a bar over the course of a few hours). It won't affect the amount of infrequent one-off transactions (say, someone deciding to buy $100 worth of BTC at an ATM).
If it's off-blockchain approach, then it's like doing Coinbase-Coinbase transfers or moving your BTC onto Ripple - useful when everyone uses the same protocol, but you have to trust someone to hold your funds for awhile.
How many transactions this will shave off from our current blocks? Someone would have to do some analysis of that.

Shotgun to head, Cyanide, Gunshot of head, Shotgun to chest, Explosives, Hit by train, Jump from height, Gunshot of chest, Hanging
They are pretty high up there. Looking at [how often various methods are used]( you have firearms taking 50% spot.
I want to take guns away from people to prevent the likelihood and severity of them doing harm to one another. The less guns there are in society, the less likely one is to encounter someone crazy trying to mug you with one and killing you, accidentally or not. That and it's a lot harder to go on mass killing sprees with a knife in comparison to a gun.

See, when you are faced with a gunman, you drawing a gun means you want to confront them, which will either end with one of you being shot and possibly killed, or some stand-off. The gunman already has a gun on you, so it is more likely you will be the getting the bullet.
The proper approach is ["don't be a hero"]( - let them take whatever they want and call the police afterwards.
Believing that you can stop a gunman just because you own a gun may just be a [Dunning-Kruger effect]( in action.

Your Bitcoins will be yours until the crypto is broken (which does not appear like a possibility for at least 50 years, or until quantum computers become viable), or someone steals your private keys.
The value of Bitcoin is just like the value of dollar, euro, bonds, stocks or the like - they are worthless save for what value people assign to them. If Bitcoin flops, they will we worth very little.

Generally, you should not be using the same private keys in more than one place. If you get funds to the address and try to spend it, the remaining funds will be moved to another private key you own (that's the case for the client, might not be for blockchain wallet). This can cause you to not see your remaining funds in one place or the other.
You will still have control over your money, but it can make things a bit messy. I would advise you to keep the private key in the wallet.dat (it's pretty hard to get rid of a private key from it) and generate a new [vanity key]( or create a new wallet.dat file and keep the address in the eWallet.

While I disagree with the business behind SatoshuDice and dislike what they are doing with their frivolous transactions, I think it is a positive thing to happen to our Bitcoin Ecosystem. It forces client developers and pool owners to address higher transaction loads, as well as force more people to pay transaction fees (as the free space is already taken up).

Thanks for all of your support in upvoting the video and replying to all the comments there. We showed some good team spirit and got the video to  spot on and somewhere about a second page of a default reddit as far as I know.
I hope we will have many more successes like this in the future. For the time being, if anyone wants to get involved in some smaller activism, there is always .

Bitinstant, here is what I want you to do:
1 - Start a campaign to get Wikipedia to accept Bitcoin
2 - Offer them a preferential rate for your services
3 - Let anyone join in your campaign pledging to donate X bitcoins to Wikipedia should they officially accept them. Also give an option of donating early through you guys (if Wikipedia does not accept money guaranteed by you in 100%, return it to the senders in a couple months).
4 - Promote the hell out of this campaign.
You would be doing a service to us all and I trust you guys with upholding your end of the bargain to both Wikipedia and people that would entrust their Bitcoins to you.

IF there will be a continuous doubling of computing power every 1.5 years (Moore's law) and that growth will continue (which from what I heard is getting less likely), brute-forcing any address will be possible in about 50 years. After that, we can always switch to a longer address length and continue.

@_date: 2012-11-25 12:35:24
I would advise you against creating your own Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency. The security of such a currency depends on the computing power available to you. If someone was to connect some ASIC device to your currency it could most likely take over your currency and drive it to the ground.
There are two alternatives:
You could create a centralised currency by just running some server that would be keeping track of who owns how much money. This approach is fairly easy.
Alternatively, you could be the first Kingdom to adopt Bitcoin as its legal tender and receive a spot in the Bitcoin history ;). This option is even easier than the previous one.

The chances of you guessing someone's private key are smaller than you winning the lottery... a billion times... each second... since the beginning of the universe.
(quick calculations, might be off by a few factors, and computers guess fast, but it's still a big number)
That's roughly the chance of two people generating the same private key randomly. In other words - it will not happen.
@_date: 2012-10-30 07:23:23
Hmm, that's a good answer, but I guess there will also be a separate case for some high-profile websites, such as MtGox, that wouldn't be relying on third party websites to secure their money. How do you think that would work?
And be sure to post this answer on the StackExchange when it's fully functioning (I think it might be okay right now), it might be useful for some people ;).

As the person responsible for this, let me explain:
We used dog and cat as a description of a common cat and dog characters, while canine and feline would be a grouping of the entire family of species. Say, if you had a cat, a tiger, lion and so forth, you can look for them as individual species, or in general, as feline. Some people like their specific species, other prefer general ones, so this is a way to appease both.

The length of verification is "either 6 blocks or 1 hour, whichever comes later". It would be like saying that 1 confirmation in a currency that takes 5 seconds to generate a block is just as trustworthy as 1 confirmation in Bitcoin. They are not.

I'm glad you expressed your opinion on Bitcoin. Being a part of this community for awhile now, I do see some hoarders and "gold bug"-esque people around, some libertarians and some scammers. I have also seen a lot of people coming up with innovative new ideas on what to use Bitcoin for, as well as activists that use the currency for the greater good (for example, freeing people from oppressive monetary regimes of Argentina and Iran). However, what struct me the most about the community, is how active it is to doubt scammers and eject them from the community. A lot of people using Bitcoin are uncompromising when it comes to security and trust - you have to provide as much of the first and earn the second in order to be successful. I haven't yet seen another community that was so adamant about those issues.
As for issues of mining - it's not for newcommers, really. It has become the same as with traditional gold - if you want to be dealing with gold, you most likely will rely on other people to supply the material. On the flipside think of this - the same difficulty for a newcommer to start mining prevents malicious parties from taking over. The Bitcoin community invests a lot of money all the time into hardware and electricity to make the system secure from people wanting to destroy it.
We will see where Bitcoin will end up - it very well might become the currency of the internet. It shares the same values - freedom, inclusiveness, decentralisation, etc. As I can see it now, there are new places accepting Bitcoin every day now. I remain an optimist.
As for being welcomed here - you presented your views in a rational and respectful fashion, so the community welcomed it. Generally ideas opposing the "common" set of views here are welcome, as long as the poster remains objective.
@_date: 2012-12-09 09:17:20
Most solutions do not exist on testnet. SatoshiDice increases the load of the Bitcoin Network and thus makes people consider their solutions - do pool owners want to include 0 fee transactions? Do businesses really want to run a full node client? Such a thing couldn't be achieved on testnet.

You need to get your hands on oclvanityminer from samr7 -  . The pool is used to generate private keys that when combined with other private keys make a vanity address you desire. The system requires 0 trust from the person requesting the vanity address, as they never share their private key with us. The miner is basically competing to solve some mathematical problem, which is similar to traditional mining.

People post bounties for creating a vanity address they want to have, people tune in to the pool and use their hashing power to look for solutions. If you find the solution, you submit it and you get a bounty. It is quite similar to block mining - get a miner - run it - profit.

I'm glad you enjoyed my small tip made on , here's one for you for actually giving Bitcoin a try :)
+tip 0.01BTC
As for the client - yeah, it's kind of a hassle for newcomers. I generally advise people to use blockchain.info wallet until they get some more money in.
As for your questions:
2) The most important part of the Bitcoin wallet are the private keys. You can make public keys out of them without a problem. As long as you have the private keys, you will have access to your bitcoins.
3) The wallet stores all the private/public keys, as well as a record of known transactions on them. If needed be, all this information can be recovered from the blockchain, but the transactions that are not part of a block yet might not appear until they become a part of a block.
1) Hmm, kind of hard to answer this one. A bitcoin is sort of like a number on a cheque. It gives you funds you can spend. In order to spend these bitcoins, you need to create a new cheque, specify where you got the money from (identifying your previous cheque), how much money you are sending whom, and lastly, sign the cheque.
4) When you transfer bitcoins, you sign a transaction with your private ECDSA key. You specify which previous transactions you are getting the money from, as well as who will receive the money. You can specify a public key that will receive the money, a Bitcoin Address, or some other magical script (this option is rarely used as it is not fully supported by the clients). You then broadcast the transaction to everyone else to get it eventually included in a block and stored securely forever as part of the block chain.
If you want to have some good read on Bitcoin, you can try my master thesis -  . From what I heard, it is a good read even if you are not a programmer.

Understanding the technology behind Bitcoin does not mean you will understand Bitcoin. As someone in the community said "the first three times you think you understand Bitcoin, you don't". I've experienced it for myself and it was really a mind-boggling process.
If you want to understand more about Bitcoin, a lot of people say my master thesis is pretty approachable, you can check it out here:
As for understanding the paper, technically knowing how hashing and ECDSA work should be enough, but the paper generally doesn't go into depth on a lot of subjects. It gives a general view of how things work, but a big part of the genius lies in the implementation.

You can store your Bitcoins either on your computer in a file, or online at one of so called "eWallets". If you can protect the files on your computer form being stolen and accessed, your Bitcoins are safe. You can also trust a third party to protect your Bitcoins.
So while other payment processors offer to secure your money as they see fit (including account banning and money freezing at PayPal), Bitcoin gives you the **option** of securing your money as much as you please. All in all - it's up to you how safe your money is.

Yes, I've seen it.
@_date: 2012-11-25 09:21:16
Hmm, it's kinda hard to recollect it now, but I'll see what I can do.
Early on I think I thought that Bitcoin was something close to those  projects, like SETI or Folding. I thought someone was paying for the miners to process data for them.
At some point later I was thinking that one could only spend transactions that were part of a block. Not a big misconception, but still.
I guess my last misconception was that transactions are some simple operations of "I send money to X", but then I found out about the Script, which opened a lot more possibilities than that.
Again, it's kinda hard to recollect my thought process from over a year ago, so there might've been more. But luckily, anyone can check what questions I was asking in an order on the [StackExchange]( and try determining what was going around in my understanding process ;).
@_date: 2012-12-10 16:10:39
Slide 8, point 3 - not each node works on the proof of work, only some of the server nodes (pools and some solo miners).
Slide 10 - 80 bytes * 2016 blocks per two weeks, that gives about 4MB of block headers per year. Moore's law does not necessary apply to hard drives.
Slide 11, bullet point 1 - how can it obtain the merkle branch? Currently there is no mechanism for this.
Slide 14 - I don't think they are errors, but weaknesses. "decrypt by brute force the input" should probably be "decrypt the input by brute force". I also think you might be describing SHA-0 here (I might be wrong, however).
Slide 15 - "Nonce allows to easily check as Hash is easy to check" - what did you mean to say here?
Slide 28 - "As Bitcoin got larger more compute power was needed to hash blocks" - first of all, you probably meant to say "computing". Secondly, it sounds like you would be stating that it takes more calculations to hash a bigger block than a smaller one, which is not the case.

"There are no taxes" - yes... just like with physical money - there is no tax on a dollar bill, but on what you do with it. Honest Bitcoin users will pay taxes on what they earn in Bitcoin. Dishonest people won't pay taxes either way.

You can generate random keypairs there in an accessible way.
@_date: 2012-12-11 08:19:33
1) One private key maps to exactly one Address for each network byte (one address for Bitcoin, one address for Namecoin, etc.). You can either use an Address, or pay directly to a related public key.
2) Spending Transactions rather than having some updated ledger is that each Transaction has different amount of confirmations. It would be really hard to keep an updated ledger with each new Transaction. The Clients do all the searching and bookkeeping for you, do you don't have to do your own accounting.

Hedged accounts for Bitcoin are useful if you want to protect yourself against volatility and don't mind a centrally dictated price.

Well, if you have debt-based system, it isn't backed by any reserves, other than the trust the person will pay back in some way. But yes, in general, fractional reserve system messes with things, especially if the debtor is not distinguished from the currency issuer (say, Bank of America's debt to you when you deposit money vs. Federal Reserve's notes). If every debtor issued their own currency, you could quickly gauge the confidence level in the institution based on the currency price.

Since I'm not a lawyer, I can only guess what would be possible. If the request for funds being frozen had legal backing, then everything is working as expected. If it didn't have any legal backing, then either Ripple Labs pressured BitStamp, or BitStamp eagerly complied to the request, one way or the other reflecting badly on both Ripple Labs and BitStamp.
I am more inclined to believe that there was some lawyers involved, but I'm open to being proven otherwise.
@_date: 2015-04-22 04:43:49
Was it Ripple that froze the accounts, or was it BitStamp that possibly received a legal letter from Ripple Labs? The latter would be comparable to say, someone claiming X coins were illegally sold on BitStamp and asking BitStamp to freeze the funds until the situation is resolved.

Immediate motivation might've been the banking crisis and bailouts. This might've sparked Satoshi to work on the project. Looking at it in the longer-term, it might've been a "do it because it can be done" project - a lot of software developers, cryptographers, etc. come up with some ideas that might not have an immediate application, but they know the idea has a large potential. The core technology behind Bitcoin might've been brewing for awhile before it was put into the core client.

Because of the speed of light, mining will be centralised to a single planet by necessity.

[P2Pool is currently not compatible with tiny mobile mining devices due to the mobile data limits and block size](
@_date: 2015-11-25 22:21:06
Their plan for P2Pool v2 is new - I only learned about it from the tweet linked by OP. However, the 21.co link talks about everything else they are aiming to do with their mining chips - putting them in many devices to "redecentralize" Bitcoin. To understand why combining those two would be problematic, you have to have knowledge of [how P2Pool works currently]( - it essentially bundles a group of miners together to create a shared minipool where every block mined gives every miner the earned outputs.
To make P2Pool be useful, you need to have enough mining power to mine the blocks somewhat regularly. However, with tiny mobile devices, you would need to connect a lot of them together, which would make the coinbase potentially huge while still not having as much computing power as a few dedicated ASIC racks.
This is all before you start taking into consideration the mobile data usage, which even using dedicated pools is about [20MB per day]( P2Pool has a higher overhead since you also need to create the entire blocks yourself - essentially requiring you to be a full node. Doing that on a mobile device in North America would be prohibitively expensive with the crappy data plans that are the norm.

Yes, and that's the only currency that it currently supports (as far as I could find). Useful if you need to settle BTC between exchanges quickly, not too useful if you want to transfer any other currency.


This doesn't indicate Liquid has Proof of Liabilities (how much an exchange owes which customer), but that it has Proof of Deposits (how much was deposited to / transferred from an address). That's a good solution for settling between exchanges, but it's not useful if you want Liquid to hold all of exchange's assets and create a gox-proof Voting Pool.


This would be true if you could also settle fiat (again - I see no statement that Liquid provides that functionality). Otherwise, you can't complete the loop easily and you're stuck with a bunch of fiat that you can't get out until the price moves in the other direction.

If you're assuming that 1MB is just right, any more is too big and any less is too small, I'd like to know how you came to that conclusion. Because depending on how you derived that amount, that value will change over time.
If it's based on the price of storage, global average internet speed, etc., then the blocks should be steadily increasing to stay in the sweet spot - processing more and more transactions while being just as "ideal" as they were before in comparison to the available resources.

I pretty much agree - XRPs are generally overvalued for what utility they provide. We still have to keep in mind that people like to speculate on what they perceive the value to be and on how they predict other people speculating - if I think you will buy more tokens to speculate on them, their value will rise, so I should buy some tokens to speculate, etc. A good chunk of the crypto market is speculations, not real utility.

In general, a photo of a document is usually not enough to verify if a document is real or fake. You would need to go through some KYC verification to add some extra layer of authentication, but most KYC providers don't verify whether you're a globally unique person either. Moreover, you would also have to handle the cases of losing access to the private keys and so on.
Having people vouch for you can be subverted by a sybil attack. Perhaps it would be less vulnerable if instead you created some web-of-trust model where you only consider someone to be real if there is some unbroken trust line between the two of you, etc.
All in all, I doubt a system like this would be too useful or complete without being a part of a national identity system.

Ripple can fork, just like Bitcoin can form. We're discussing worse-case scenarios here.
As for Bitcoins being bought and sold - this adds an unnecessary step in the process that most banks wouldn't want. Say you want to settle EUR for EUR - with Ripple, it can be a direct transfer, or you would go through a EUR-EUR exchange, which should be pretty tight. With Bitcoin, you need to buy BTC, transfer it over, and sell it. You're dealing with 2 exchanges, while Ripple could accomplish the same task in 1 or 0.

Lehman Brothers was one of the banks that went bankrupt in 2008 after the housing market collapsed.

If the money was never intended to be used for payments or transmission but only for operating the transactions, it might not fall under the regulation. Then again, we're talking about USA, so the mining gear might also require full AML/KYC whenever you buy a phone and later when you decide to sell it as well.

I was thinking about a similar model - paying for consensus using transaction fees in the gateway IOUs. It might be an interesting fork, but it would probably take a strong team to develop (Ripple code is apparently a lot more complex than Bitcoin Core).

Faster blocks mean lower difficulty per-block, thus it is easier to create blocks. As such, it is easier to double-spend, so you need more blocks to secure the network. Some people falsely believe you need an hour worth of blocks to secure the network (I think even Satoshi alluded to that), while from experiments it turned out you don't need a whole hour worth of blocks - usually 8-10 blocks are fine for such coins like Litecoin and Dogecoin for example.

Depends on your definition of sidechain. Liquid is definitely a permissioned blockchain, as in it is controlled by a handful of central authorities and only they can transact on it (so far at least). Whether it's a sidechain, that's up for debate.
@_date: 2015-10-21 07:19:20
In comparison to most permissioned blockchains (Hyperledger, Eris), Coinprism's solution anchors itself into Bitcoin, giving an extra layer of auditability. Other than that, to me it looks inferior to the other solutions since Coinprism's solution appears to be only controlled by a single entity, while other solutions allow you to have multiple parties controlling the blockchain.
Generally, it appears underwhelming thus far. If this is what they were hyping up, it's disappointing.
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:09:54
So it looks like their plan is:
- Put miners in every device, like cell phones
- You won't be able to opt out of mining
- The carriers / phone manufacturers will "share" the revenue stream with you
- If you switch carriers or re-sell your phone, it might be "tough luck, you're still mining for us"
- one of 21's investors likes to earn money from patents, so 21 will probably follow suite
So in other words, 21 created a patent [so they can chase you for $1.28 per year]( (provided no difficulty increase) in shared profits. Maybe they know it's not that profitable, but they will probably sell it to hardware manufacturers as "hey, this will make you money, just pay us a lot of money upfront".

The problem with this approach is that banks would have to lock in the price of bitcoin at both ends of the trade, requiring efficient futures markets to be present at both ends of the transfer. I doubt there will be that many of those institutions present in many countries, so in the end everyone would have to bank with one or two of them, centralizing the system somewhat. Moreover, the solution would require the FX markets to bootstrap an entirely new currency onto their system and establish a liquid market between it and the local currency with the orderbook deep enough not to budge at someone tossing millions of dollars through it back and forth.
It is more likely at the rate the "Blockchain" tech is touted now that the banks would instead use [fiat-denominated cryptos]( and use the existing FX market for more efficient trading.

As I understand, SideChains will offer a way for people to move their bitcoins into the sidechain and back again through some standardized way. Once the coins enter the sidechain, the Bitcoin blockchain won't be tracking them, and the data on how they move will be stored in the sidechain. If the data is not stored in the Bitcoin blockchain, it doesn't matter whether the coins are in a sidechain, or on Ripple, or anywhere else - the same protocol can most likely be used to deposit and withdraw the coins.
I might be wrong - I am not following the SideChains development closely. At the same time, there are other means of depositing / withdrawing Bitcoins and other cryptos to 2.0 networks without trusting a singular party - voting pools, that I linked earlier, or Codius can achieve distributed (not decentralized) way to achieve this.
So while SideChains might be an interesting development, they are no more interesting than the 2.0 space really. Saying "this thing that is not Bitcoin is a distraction, but this other thing that also isn't Bitcoin is not" is just one person's opinion.

It could be managed by private companies provided they have a wide-enough reach (giving everyone access), and prevent duplicate entries across the companies (nobody can register with two companies to obtain two IDs). Governments are ideal for this, since they already issue IDs, while private companies would need to build up the required infrastructure.

I guess the problem of stealing keys / passport is why we would need some central server to keep track of that. It could keep a registry of all valid and stolen keys and one can validate whether a passport is valid by just querying for its public key. If there would be no additional data attached to the request (for example - who made the request and what for), it's pretty much anonymous still. The government might know that your data is being polled, but wouldn't know why and by whom - it could be a random request from some forum, or a boarder patrol for all it knows.

You need a currency if you're dealing with entities you don't know and don't trust.

Most identity verification relies on government-issued IDs. Services like [NetVerify]( can only check whether an ID has been modified, not whether the person holding the ID is not someone they are not.
The system might not be ideal, but there isn't an alternative at the moment. We don't have another company that issues it's own IDs to unique individuals. As such, even if the government isn't 100% efficient, it's the only game in town that can accomplish this. Everyone else, since they rely on government IDs, are less efficient by definition.

That is a USD-CNY market on Ripple. USD is provided by one Gateway (like BitStamp), CNY by another (like Ripple Fox), and anyone that has one of those IOUs can submit a trade onto the open Ripple network like you would on any other exchange. In other words, you can trade USD for CNY technically without limits and circumvent some banking restrictions between those countries, at least until one of the gateways shuts you down.

Well, figuring out whether or not [blockchain technology]( is useful for value transfer is a whole debate on its own.
That being said, if you're talking about having a few exchanges settling with one another, they could do that in pretty much any way they want. With or without blockchain, centralized or decentralized, public or permissioned.
Probably the simplest, no-frills way of creating an inter-exchange settlement network between exchanges could be by using Hyperledger / Ripple to track debt and settle once in awhile through traditional means. This would even let you transfer non-BTC value around. Moreover, if you create a web of trust between exchanges, it could scale pretty well without everyone having to trust everyone.
If you're only interested in BTC, you could just use green addresses (like MtGox and TradeHill tried doing years back), or have some other accelerated settlement like [Impulse](

Well, Ripple innovated over Ripple Classic by turning it into a decentralized network. Earlier it was more like Open Transactions from what I understand - islands of local Ripple webs of trust. I think they also were the first ones to push the gateway model - the Classis was more focused on peer-to-peer trust, rather than gateway-customer trust. They might've also had one of the earliest distributed, multi-currency exchanges on a crypto network, plus their atomic multi-currency swaps are still pretty much unseen in the crypto world. Addition of XRP is spam prevention on the network, hardly innovative. But yeah, Ripple is quite like SWIFT, SEPA or ACH, only running on a decentralized network that anyone can join, issue their own currency and transact in. Either this is the greatest thing offered by them, preventing any international embargos or currency controls, or their [potential future downfall]( if some governments don't like that idea.

Well, I would imagine that if you had exchanges getting into the gateway business, this is what would happen:
- Everyone would bootstrap the fiat-BTC market from the exchange's orderbook pretty easily
- Having BTC-BTC market would be a no-brainer and we'd quickly reach 1:1 exchange rate.
- Having this, you are already replacing Liquid
- Fiat-fiat for the same currency would be close second, with the price reflecting how hard it is to deposit / withdrawal to the exchange
- You can now close the loop and stabilize the fiat-BTC market for any given currency
- You can now start doing fiat-fiat going through BTC, going through the best rate you can find on any fiat-BTC market
All in all, it might take a bit, but if people would start using the network, you'd have the required liquidity soon enough.

Whatever technology you develop to have sidechains deposit and withdraw Bitcoin, you can port over to other systems. However, just like currency is the least interesting thing about the Bitcoin technology, all I hear around sidechains is just focus on them being able to be pegged with Bitcoin. What else do they offer that the current 2.0 systems don't offer?

If you bought Bitcoins at any time from 2009 to a week or two ago, your Bitcoins have not only retained their value but increased in value. So they do have the store of value aspect to them - Bitcoins don't expire like food or coupons. The future is uncertain and the price fluctuations can be big, but that doesn't mean that Bitcoins are not a store of value.
Gold has the advantage of long history of being traded, which Bitcoin will have to catch up to, there is no denying that. At the same time, if you compare Bitcoin to other altcoins, it has the same historical advantage as gold has to other metals, only on a much shorter time scale.
Then again, store of value by itself is not (at least not commonly) a characteristic of money. It can be tied to durability, as in money should not expire or go bad. Bitcoin has that, so does gold.
Can you point to some definition from a credible source of what money is that names store of value as one of the characteristics that money needs to have?

TestNet Bitcoins are just like Bitcoins but meant to be used only for testing. They are by design created to be free, as the TestNet can be unstable and can be reset at any point (we are currently at TestNet 3). They are useful for testing your applications without the worry of losing real money or causing some problems on the MainNet.
Selling TestNet coins for money is looked down at - if they start having value, people will try treating it like MainNet - plugging their ASICs in and what have you and generally destroying the spirit of TestNet.
This is why I created the Faucet - to give those coins away for free. There used to be another Faucet ran by Gavin, but they had some problems and closed down awhile back. After it went down, people were having problems getting their hands on TestNet coins and actually started to pay a little for them.

It is still wasteful, but it might be optimally wasteful, as in not creating any more waste than it needs.

I have purchased a few coins. My main problem was with international shipping and some batch of them getting lost in customs. Casascius sent replacement coins for free, so kudos for him.
I think those coins are safe. I don't think it would be possible to read the numbers on the back of the hologram, although I haven't tried removing the hologram without damaging it to potentially forge the coin security.
Main weakness of the coin is having to rely on Casascius not to store private keys or be able to recreate them. So far he is running his business legitimately and has a good standing in the community, but this may or may not change in the future. Asides from that, the mini private key format offers a bit less bits of entropy than a standard private key, meaning brute forcing it is easier, although it is still way above capability of any supercomputer in the foreseeable future.

It generates a ton of publicity in the process - "1 Bitcoin is now worth $1M!", "Every Bitcoin adopter absurdly rich now".

There are so called [BIPs]( that help standardize various aspects of Bitcoin. Whether one accepts it or not are up to every individual client user (or client developer), but in most cases they are nothing major. Last time a more important change was proposed (multisig transactions as far as I remember), each block created for a certain period of time was voting whether to accept the proposal or not. The vote was encrypted in the coinbase transaction. This way the majority of the computing power of the Bitcoin network (mainly through the pools) was voting on the way they wanted to change the protocol.
Such dramatic change to the protocol would probably be handled the same way - it wouldn't be mandated by a central authority (like the Bitcoin Foundation), but probably arise as a consensus. It might be the case when a drastic measure might need to be taken that would go against the miners (for example, changing the hashing algorithm used by block creation - this would force every old ASIC to be pretty much worthless), and then it would be an interesting dilemma...
@_date: 2013-03-09 18:41:23

Signing a message means that the person signing the message owns the private keys to a given address. This means that most likely they are the rightful owner of that address (or have otherwise gained access to that private key through theft or the like) and can spend the money (in case you want to prove that you own some bitcoins).
However, the message should be meaningful to a given context to be reliable - anyone can copy the same message and signature and claim that they have signed the message. If the message itself contains unique details about the context and date however (like signing the URL of this post), then it is only usable in this context and thus was generated for this context.

@_date: 2013-02-27 16:02:39
Well, that is the problem. While I honestly believe that you are being honest running an unlicensed online gambling operation, or at least sincerely hope that you are being honest, that doesn't change much. In the Bitcoin world, if you want people to trust you, you either need to have a long reputation of being honest, or prove your honesty through math.
Lets be the most pessimistic we can here - while anyone can claim that the result is random, what if they are just trying to cheat the players by skewing the odds against them? If you don't have a proof of being fair, everyone has the right to assume you can be dishonest. With provably fair gambling, you can provide everyone proof that you did not tempter with the results of the game.
Improving the game to be provably fair to a satisfactory degree shouldn't be too hard - the game is simple.

If a Bitcoin company does great, you benefit as well from supporting the economy.

Well, producing such money that would be hard to counterfeit would be a bit costly.

Maybe it would be useful at some Bitcoin convention or casino. One way or the other, that's something to consider for the future.

My point of view as a user, if I had to ban someone I would first ban . However, at the same time I don't think banning is the best option to handle such a situation. Now we start banning people because they derail our conversations, later we will want to start banning people because they don't circlejerk with us. We all have perfectly adequate tools to deal with the situation at hand - we can downvote them when they are talking stupid, not humour any troll attempts and if someone is actually engaging in spamming - report their posts to be removed. Only if the situation really gets out of hand would I consider a ban. As it stands, I don't think there is anyone deserving of being banned (asides the obvious spambot appearing all the time).
As a mod, I don't think we should be banning anyone at this time for the reasons mentioned.

Then define your intrinsic value, since I know two definitions that I address:

* [Numismatic intrinsic value]( - coins have intrinsic value of the metal they are made out of
If you want to debate, please explain:
* Your definition of intrinsic value
* Which of Marx's theories/ideas/works are you referring to? Marxism is generally about the workers owning the means of production (as opposed to capitalism where you have say, factory owners owning the machines in factories and so forth). Cost to produce something would be the same whether we would be in a Marxist system or capitalism.

It might be possible, although it would still create a lot of small block forks. As Mars is 4-20 light minutes away depending on the position of the planets, sending a block across would take upwards of 20 minutes. Roughly the chance of block forking in that time would be about 50%. We would need a block generation time of about 100 minutes to get that number under 95%. The planet with a lower hashrate would most likely be the one suffering, and if you get most of your blocks rejected, you wouldn't want to be mining anyway.

Well, in the documentation we can see:
If you have more than 100 comment karma, a couple millibits (0.002 BTC + (YOUR KARMA * 0.00000001) BTC) will be sent to a specified address. You can only do this once. You may use the bitcoin address that the bot gives you or you may use one of your own bitcoin addresses.
So with your karma, it will be about 0.0032 BTC, or 13 cents. Not too much I guess.
To accept tips, you need to send an [ACCEPT message to the Bitcointip bot]( Then you will claim those Bitcoins. If you want to sell your Bitcoins, you might want to check out localbitcoins.com , or any of those options -  . Just to note - best don't buy Bitcoins for PayPal or with credit cards, there is a high risk of being scammed.
However, unless you have some decent amount of Bitcoins to sell, it will most likely take more resourced to transfer the money over than what it might be worth. You can however keep some pocket change in Bitcoins for now and perhaps use them to pay your friends directly? There are even shops where you can buy [cupcakes with Bitcoin]( ;)

Okay, you have say, MtGox at $1000/BTC, and Bitstamp at $900/BTC. Both exchanges would have the same ratio of BTC to LTC since getting BTC and LTC to and from those exchanges would be easy.

Okay, lets see...
Bitcoin Wallets are containers for Bitcoin Addresses that are stored on a computer or a web service. Anyone can create any number of Addresses, and since the key space is really big (256 bits for private-public keypairs, 160 bits for Addresses), you won't be able to use them all up or create collisions in a reasonable time frame. You can't really DDOS that.
You can DDOS an online service that would be creating addresses for you, but that would only take down that one service.
If you imply using a lot of new addresses and putting them in the Bitcoin Blockchain, then you are facing the issue of [transaction fees]( - sending 1 satoshi to an address would cost you 0.1mBTC per kB under normal circumstances. You would run out of money before you would run out of addresses, and you would just bloat up the Blockchain a bit. SatoshiDice has already done that to some extent, it just makes the system a bit more unwieldy to synchronize, but doesn't change much else.
If you were mining Bitcoin Blocks yourself you could bloat them up with 1MB of transactions for "free". You would need to pay for the hardware and electricity to mine blocks, but lets say you break even by selling the block reward. This would go back to the previous point - you would bloat up the Blockchain a bit. Owning 1% of the mining power of the world would give you 1MB block inserted every 100 bocks / 1000 minutes or 0.7 days. The network would have to thus handle about 1.43MB of extra data being stored daily, it's not very threatening.
The thing is, all addresses you generate from private keys are legitimate and can be used to redeem the money. You could be tempted to send your coins to addresses that are generated from invalid RIPEMD hashes, like 1111111111111111111114oLvT2 , but that would just shrink the money supply based on the amount you send, increasing how much everyone else's bitcoins are worth.
So all in all, you can't DDOS address creation or the blockchain with too many addresses. You can DDOS a centralized service and bloat the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-05-09 00:08:57
Well, it's still [vapourware]( I guess.

Well, ignoring the moral and legal issues, there is also an argument that SilkRoad-like system can reduce the overall amount of violence. There is less gang violence, since people are not on the streets fighting for territory to push their products. There are less bad products around, since you have a reputation system. There is less theft, since there is the escrow system in place. People get more variety, since they are not limited by their local sellers and buyers.

The IRC chat has stopped being important a long while back. It was only used to find peers, not propagate blockchain info. Currently that is being done by a list of static trusted nodes in the client and a few servers that seed the peer information. It isn't that much of a deal, this is mainly used the first time someone connects to a network.
DDOSing a single node is always an issue. On the same page you have a discussion about that -  .
Another great resource to check out is  - search for any topic that might interest you and you will most likely find an answer. If you can't find something, ask away and some really good crypto people can help you answer that. It is much more convenient for research than a reddit thread ;).

I'm not really dividing up the space, more like redirecting the traffic. Newbie questions are best asked in a newbie subreddit, so they get full attention there.

See, generating addresses means you have them **on your machine**. This does not mean that anyone else needs to verify them. Sending transactions, however, would need to be verified. At the same time, if you spam some node with invalid transactions, it will disconnect you.
Generating addresses generates 0 network traffic. You will never use up all wallet addresses.

What you are describing is what Bitcoin does. There are also various other means of preventing a 51% attack used by other alt-coins. Also, as far as I remember Bitcoin has a mechanism designed to prevent orphaning of blocks by chains that contain fewer transactions and transactions that are younger. This means that a 51% attack might damage the network, but not destroy it completely.

Unless someone wants to maximise their profits, then they would try to sell as Friday evening when the price is the highest and buy on Saturday evening when the price is the lowest.

What to tell the banker about Bitcoin? "Your days are numbered, we are coming" ;)
Seriously though, if you want to set up an exchange, you would need to get some legal decisions first as to whether Bitcoin is money, commodity or something else and how to properly handle and tax it. After that, setting up an exchange would be easy.
You can tell them that Bitcoin can do what banks can do but faster and cheaper in pretty much every respect. You can say that Bitcoin is like Internet gold, rather than a fiat currency.

1) You need to understand how the hashing algorithm works down to its most basic operations
2) You need to understand how to implement such functions using boolean logic
3) You need to know how to implement boolean logic on integrated circuits
4) After that, you would need to be able to create an integrated circuit, program it and make an interface between it and computer mining software
After that, a lot of hard work, optimalisation, a big investment in production and you might end up with the next ASIC out there. Generally, a lot of hard work that requires a lot of knowledge.

It might be possible, but the main problem with double spends is to send the false transaction to the seller. This would be like combing the Internet to find which website one is browsing at the moment - it might be yours, but most likely it is someone else's.
You would then need to feed them the double spend while feeding the rest of the network the conflicting transaction. This can be done with but one client - just need to be connected to a few supernodes, pools and miners and you are set.

There is a debate going on on the size of blocks - currently the maximum size is 1MB (although for now most often 250kB is filled). There can be many transactions in a single block. Just look at blockchain.info and check out a few blocks to see how many transactions are encoded in each one.

Bitcoin's network security comes from majority of the processing power being used by honest miners. Should any attacker reach 51% of the power, they would control the network. Increase in hashing speed makes it more and more costly to perform such an attack, and thus ensures the network is safe and secure.
You can read more on it in my master thesis -

I haven't heard of the first two, and I haven't looked much into the last one to give my opinion. From what I know, Mastercoin is still in its infancy, so I wouldn't recommend it just yet. Other than that the fact that it piggy backs on top of Bitcoin makes it less appealing to me.

Security of Bitcoin relies in part on the security of Blocks. To create a Block one has to bruteforce a lot of computations - it can't be done on a whim and requires a lot of work. Since there are many Miners creating Blocks in the Bitcoin Network, their combined computing power is really immense (it is estimated to be the most powerful distributed supercomputer on Earth). In order to harm Bitcoin, one would need to amass more computing power than all the honest Miners combines - which is a lot. Alt-coins, on the other hand, don't have that much power behind them and are a lot easier to attack.

Provided MtGox doesn't flag you for money laundering something, which it tends to do at random. You will need to verify your account and what have you.
If you will be trying to buy SR stuff in that setup, someone could technically bust you provided they have access to MtGox's data and transacts with you on SR. While that might or might not be likely is up for debate, but do keep it in mind in case you want something else than home-made chocolate chip cookies or what have you.

Those are hard ones. Seeing as they get a lot of upvotes, it appears that people like hearing those stories. I would personally just downvote them (and advise everyone else to vote based on their preference as well) unless they are totally off-topic (financial news appear to be liked here). If the other mods decide that such articles should be deleted, I will follow along.
As for memes, unless they are bothersome I would probably treat them the same as financial news - vote accordingly. If they start becoming too prominent, then we should start encouraging some new subreddit for Bitcoin memes.
However, I would personally rather delete all threads like "Bitcoin Gem currently at XYZ" after the first one. Those were at a time quite annoying and just gave too much exposure to something that frankly didn't deserve it at the time.

The point being is that Bitcoins have **kept** their value, so they are a store of value. Increase in price is a bonus.
As for the "credible source", you are using reverse logic - you first claim that gold is money, therefore all characteristics it has all money needs to have. It would be like claiming "money needs to be made out of metal".
What I had in mind was more like [the wiki article on money]( - "The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally in the past, a standard of deferred payment.". Your argument against Bitcoin is that it is not a store of value, since it's been around for a short time so it's future value is unpredictable. I agree that one can't be certain whether Bitcoin will be around in 10 years (although I would personally bet on "yes", but it's not a matter of opinion). My argument against gold is that it fails as a medium of exchange, since there are barely any places to can **spend** gold (not sell it, but spend it), and using gold in the digital age is archaic - you can't reasonably use it for online payments. Do you disagree with this statement?
Can you give me the definition of money and currency you are using? The distinction between those can be crucial to our further arguments.

Yeah, I know HB's stance on Bitcoin - it hasn't changed in months. However, I emailed both HB and Unknown Worlds offering them a partial solution to the problem they are experiencing. So this might be a step forward from "please accept Bitcoin, it's awesome", to "you have a problem that Bitcoin can fix". I am guessing HB will respond with the same cookie-cutter response, but UW guys might actually give it more consideration - they probably got hit the worst. Then, in turn, they might consider putting some pressure on HB to actually evaluate the solution instead of responding with a copy-paste statement. UW has probably more influence over HB than us.

I wrote my own brainwallet js, in case you are asking about the brainwallet.org website - their code is not available under an open license to the best of my knowledge.
After once enters the passphrase and clicks "Prepare transaction", the passphrase is internally converted to a private key and the address. The address is used to fetch the unspent transactions, the private key is used to sign the new transaction. After the popup is closed, the private key and the passphrase are forgotten.
To the best of my knowledge, there is some DOM model in extensions that prevent other extensions from accessing data from my extension and vice versa. So unless I understood the Chrome Extension documentation wrong, there isn't a possibility that this happens.
There is an open source repo for this ( but it's not under an open source license. We can always discuss the matter of incorporating this tech into your extensions privately ;).

1) Okay, then tell Peter Schiff to stop using the term "intrinsic value". My approach in the rebuttal was - "he uses the term as the pinnacle point of why gold is money and Bitcoin is not, so I will approach the term and see what it means". The approach you propose is shared by Erik Voorhees. He proposes to instead look at usefulness value, which I also address.
2) I agree with you that the labour theory of value does not work in the context of Bitcoin. Bitcoins' value is not related to the cost of producing it, due to its limited quantity and other factors.

Yes, the increased hashing power would be available to both honest and dishonest nodes. However, they have different motivations for investing. An honest miner wants to increase their profits, so they invest in mining equipment. The more they have, the more they can earn. A dishonest miner would only achieve their goal if they would invest a lot of money into it. There wouldn't be a difference for them between owning 10% and 20%. They alone would need to match all honest nodes' power in order to destroy the network.
What's also interesting is that Bitcoin disincentives performing 51% attack - a miner that is not driven externally to destroy Bitcoin has more incentive to use their mining power to benefit the network, than to go against it (through block rewards).

If the UW people would decide that their chargeback rate is too high to make viable business, offering Bitcoin would be a viable solution. If you have to make a choice between -$30k and a small positive number, which one would you chose? If people would want to sue credit cards, they could still go onto Steam and buy it there, with the HB Store remaining as a cheaper alternative for Bitcoin.
The solution might not be ideal or provide short-term benefits, but it will deal with the chargeback problem if it is big enough and still offer some business, which would be better to just closing the store.

In the Bitcoin world, people believe you when:
 - You have enough reputation, usually achieved through a long period of activity in the community
 - You can prove that you are not cheating them
Since you would be collecting money for a charity, you could issue some official letter from the charity stating that you are taking Bitcoin donations using address X. You can also put the donation address in a noticeable spot on your web page - this is generally enough for most people. If you want to be all crypto about it, you would need to issue a PGP public key and use that to sign a statement that you are accepting Bitcoin donations on address X. This would mainly work if you have an established identity tied to a PGP key, which probably won't be in your case. Lastly, I think using third party payments processors could help you a bit with credibility - I think they do display the details of the person you are donating to and so forth.
All in all, I would at least put the donation address on the web page. It should be enough for most people. Using a payment processor would be a bonus and would probably let you get traditional money quickly and cheaply. Anything beyond that is probably too much.

ASICs are only designed to perform SHA(SHA(X)) computations used for block mining. Address mining requires ECDSA curve operations, RIPEMD(SHA(X)) computations, and then a few more split-key mathematics.

Generally hardware wears down with use. Since you will be mining at full speed for a long period of time, you will wear down your fans and since the whole system will be working at high temperature, it has a higher chance of breaking sooner.

Thin wallet by itself is not necessarily less secure than BitcoinQT - I don't think there are any thin client specific attacks if the client is good enough.
However, each client is a different piece of code, meaning that there might be different exploits in each one unique to it. Web wallets can be vulnerable to theft if their passwords are weak and they are easily accessible to anyone for example.

You would only be updating wallet.dat in a significant way when you will be sending money from it. If you are just putting money into it, you don't need to update the wallet file.
You don't need to update backups, just backup your latest wallet file every now and then if you are sending money from it.
As for public keys (at least in BitcoinQT), a new one is used every time you send money from the wallet. Since you should be using the cold wallet most of the time for saving money, you generally shouldn't run out of those keys too quickly. Other than that, new keys are being generated when old ones are used, so you will always have a buffer.

You can use physical Bitcoins, which in theory lets you pay for things in Bitcoin without using computers.
Asides from that it is possible to compute everything involved in Bitcoin transactions by hand and create a completely offline transaction, but that would have to be sent to the blockchain at some point through the use of a computer and would be really tedious. Generally, it would involve computing REALLY large numbers (256 bits) and so forth. Doable, but very impractical.

Your posts in the current form are a repetitive spam and are being removed as such. Nobody wanted to see you post about nothing for 21 days straight. Try making every post unique and self-contained in its own right - don't say it is day X of Y, don't start it with the same self-promotion. Write only when you have something interesting to share. Nobody likes seeing the same thing appear day in and day out. Your first post promoting your service was well received because it was something new, everything else was just repetitive spam.

Well, that would create a nasty fork - each side would think their blocks are valid and reject the other ones, which would make them incompatible with one another. That could create some mess with communication between peers until one side changes some communication parameters as well - like [the Magic Number (0xD9B4BEF9 - it identifies a block as being part of the Bitcoin network as opposed to other nets out there)](

"A typical supernova releases something like 10^51 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that **brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.**"

If you want, you can give him my email - ThePiachu - I can consult him on Bitcoin matters if needed be.
Most obvious things that comes to mind is offering an exchange service for buying and/or selling Bitcoins. They could run their own exchange, or just be like BitPay. Since they already would be a registered money transmitter and comply with aml laws, they would be in a very strong position to quickly become one of the most credible institutions for handling such matters.
They could also offer some additional services, like offering a Bitcoin-powered debit card, possibly running Bitcoin ATMs in their branches or the like. Depends on how much they want to get involved.
If they are an international bank, they could offer VERY cheap and fast international money transfers based on Bitcoin technology.
They could also promote the Bitcoin services to their customers and be their main point of contact / consultancy for Bitcoin business. For example, they could promote business to accept Bitcoin transfers, offer to convert their bitcoins straight into fiat like BitPay, or otherwise see what benefit Bitcoins might be to their clients - "You are doing a lot of international outsourcing? Have you considered lowering your costs with Bitcoin?".
It all probably depends on the size of the bank and what type of business they want to support. Bigger banks would probably scoff at Bitcoin since it might be taking away their business, but some smaller ones might use it to stay on the cutting edge of the finance world and get some loyal customers in the meantime.
As I said, if needed be I can consult on the matter more directly with you or him if needed be - I know quite a lot about the technology and it would be my pleasure to help out.

I understand your concern. The spirit of that rule is to discourage people from claiming "I am a dying war veteran, please send money to X" - everyone can make up a story and slap an address to that. Similarly, if one claims to be representing some charity but uses a different address from the one displayed on their official website, one should be weary of people impersonating charity workers and stealing money.
What we're doing is promoting Bitcoin adoption through donations. We don't ask for bitcoins for ourselves, the person receiving the bitcoins does not keep it for himself, instead using it as a prize in a tournament he organizes.
I do understand that it goes against the letter of the rule, but the spirit is different. I suppose we should consider this situation and address it in the rules. Thank you for pointing it out.

Every new BTC goes to miners. They also earn transaction fees. They are the ones doing the hard work securing the network against double spends, Finney attacks and 51% attacks. Everyone else in the network isn't doing too much work in comparison.
Because it takes money (hardware and electricity costs) to make bitcoins, they have [an intrinsic value]( People buying BTC from the miners are paying for their work.
The system might not be perfect, but it's a damned good way of solving the problem of distributed currency generation. Because of mining we know the coins are distributed fairly between people that contribute to securing the network.

Well, I personally take it as a proof of concept - in Ripple you can issue credit money (all non-ripple currencies in the system), as well as debit money (ripples). Both in my mind are a great tool for issuing stocks and private currency.
At the moment, they are not charging for ripples, which is both good and bad. Good, because they are giving them away for finding bugs and they aim to give away a lot more of them at some time, and bad because people that want to use the system can't get their hands on it. We'll see where it goes.

Well, since I was a student for the bulk of my experience with Bitcoin, I didn't have too much money to buy BTC. Currently I'm at an okay job, but it's still not paying enough to be investing too much. I will be investing in Bitcoin in the long term, but at the moment I am comfortable with what I got out of it thus far. I'm mainly bull when it comes to Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean I can't cash out at times ;).

If you are willing to put up with what, 10% inflation and whatever % fees you are imposing on the stores for accepting your card, not being able to send your money freely (without using third party software like PayPal [charging you for the privilege] - you can't just send someone some visa money), then by all means, don't use Bitcoin.
Bitcoin at the moment is a bit hard to get into, but once you have everything set up, sending a Bitcoin payment is easier than using ccs. With Bitcoin you don't need to enter your personal information, long numbers or other useless data when buying digital downloads for example.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:03:52

By the time Bitcoin hits $100, people won't want to cash out.

If you want to play around with Bitcoins and how they can be used, but don't want to get coins for monetary value, yes. TestNet bitcoins are like normal Bitcoins, but they do not have any value.

"Shuffling the cards using the Bitcoin transaction id as a seed ensures that neither the server nor the client could possibly know the final shuffle before you start playing."
Yeah, about that - tranasction IDs are public to anyone. Now one needs to just figure out your seed / shuffling algorithm, run a few tests and they can win every hand against you guys. This is not random seed, this is seed that anyone can know...

So lets see, my small comments:
 - Wallet is not a Client
 - Transactions don't need to be confirmed by 6 Nodes, but by 6 Blocks
 - The topic of Difficulty could be explained better
 - With alt-coins, there is only room for one Bitcoin-like currency in the world really. Potential flaws in the system could be patched up with some Protocol change, and as for the weaknesses, there is a small list of them. Biggest weaknesses would be the double-spend, 51% attack and scalability.

Giving people money, as Bitcoin does, is a pretty simple matter in legal terms. Borrowing people money can be a minefield of legal trouble. At least we'll have some other people to be scapegoats when banks will try to crack down on the peer-to-peer finances ;).
The ever-shifting balances of who owns who what will probably make people more weary of using Ripple. One day you owe your friend $100, and your brother owes you $100, the next day your friend owes you money and you need to pay your relative. I would rather my balance sheets in my brain not to be messed with.
Other than that, it is an interesting system. It could solve the problem of creating local currencies and what have you.

With the increased volume of submissions to the subreddit that we will probably be getting, a lot of people browsing the /new are more likely to vote on memes they can take in in a second and less likely to vote on meaningful article or piece of content (and to read it). Memes bubble up to the top very easy, articles with actual news can get buried down since not enough people will read them.
Reducing the amount of content from /new encourages people to take in the content and vote on meaningful content.

Forwarding address is handled through Blockchain -  . I specify "I want a forwarding address for X", and they give me an address and forward everything themselves.
I understand that you wouldn't trust me, that's why I also provided TB's address and a link to his YouTube channel where that address can be found. Feel free to donate directly to him.
On the other hand, you can look at the transaction history in the forwarding address - there have already been 0.38BTC received and forwarded to TB's address. If you want to donate less than that, you should be safe - if I wanted to take that money I couldn've already stolen more from the start.
The way Blockchain has set up forwarding addresses it's really hard to verify anything - they don't offer any way to verify that they control those addresses or anything like that.
So again, if you are having any doubts, go to TB's YouTube page and use the address from there -  .

I don't think that the assumption "politicians will be too scared to be politicians" would hold up. The situation would be no different from the early days of the USA, where people would be risking their life to undermine the British, or like underground networks of Europe during WW2.
A wave of assassinations would force the government to tighten security, restrict access to guns and perhaps enforce police state. Quite the opposite of the intention.
On the other hand, the threat of being assassinated might force the politicians to care about their electors, rather than perform their own politics.
At any rate, it would require more thought and consideration.

"Our managed sidebar ads start at a $20-$50k minimum spend.  They are managed through our in-house sales team.  If you are interested, and can give us some more information about your product, goals, budget, etc, we can answer for you."
"The subreddit ads are different.  Folks create 300x250 ads for subreddits and submit them to the team chooses different ones to feature from there. :)"
So we can spend money on a normal ad, and/or create a sidebar ad and try getting it chosen on the proper subreddit.

It could be lower if there was much higher liquidity, that is people would be spending their bitcoins fast, rather than storing them. Alternatively, if USD undergoes massive deflation it could lower the USD/BTC exchange rate. None of those scenarios are really likely.
Why do you want to set some arbitrary price between USD and BTC? It changes nothing - you can still transact with milibitcoins as with bitcoins. Only reason to want low price so you can buy them up, hoard them and then sell them when they are worth more.

Thanks so much for your email and taking time to share your suggestion for adding Bitcoin as a way to pay for your Kiva loans.
At Kiva we do not process payment, but instead use PayPal to process all financial transactions as they provide us with free payment processing. I'm not sure if PayPal accepts Bitcoin, but you may suggest this payment option to them as well.
For questions about the checkout process or regarding PayPal, contact PayPal's customer service line by dialing 888-445-5032 (Toll Free US) or 402-952-8811 (International), Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. CST.
Thanks for your support of Kiva.

Well, the thing is - does it really matter? If I email them and they respond negatively, we both lose a bit of time. If they respond positively, I can either just ignore them or spread the word. If I do the first, I am a dick, but to this day I never did that nor do I plan on doing that. If I do the second, they get recognition in the Bitcoin community, I and some other people donate money to them, etc. - in general, they get some money and recognition out of it, the Bitcoin community gets a sense of accomplishment, free advertising and possibly a positive bump in Bitcoin value.
The only negative outcomes of this is them responding negatively - in this case we both lose a bit of time, and me being a dick if they respond positively, which won't happen. Otherwise the outcome is a win-win.
If you are analysing this from a game theory perspective - it doesn't really matter if I have interest in their mission, as long as I am committed to at least compensate them for the time they might spend to set up a way to accept Bitcoin (if they would be using BitPay, it wouldn't be much).
I understand that you might disapprove of such an approach and you would rather people act out of their genuine beliefs, but that doesn't mean that everyone thinks the same (especially when it comes to money).

I would love to see some altcoin test it out (perhaps some TestNet-in-a-box one).
As for putting the pressure on the miner - that's more or less the point of it. Miners and pools would get the rewards of extra transactions included in the blocks, so they should also bear the extra cost of adding those transactions. Having that extra cost would let the network find some equilibrium price of a transaction without having to impose arbitrary limits.

It is a valid concern, but as far as I know BitPay allows you to set your prices in USD and converts the amount on the spot for the exchange at the time / 24 hour average. This way your tickets can still cost roughly the same price in USD at all times. Admittedly, one needs to be carrying around a bit of extra BTC in case of fluctuation, but that's more or less a given.

Well, I guess you would need some interesting twist for it. Perhaps:
- offer a notable amount of money and perhaps only accept students? This way you can be seen as promoting young people. It should get you some recognition for merely pumping enough money into it (see Riot and LoL)
- Appeal to the programmer geeks and torture the contestant - perhaps make them write in Shakespeare, Brainfuck or Ook. It could have a nieche appeal, but your costs would be smaller. You might get some internet fame for all the lulz of the programs (try reading our Shakespeare programs like you'd read poetry out loud)
- Present some interesting challenges, perhaps developing something against other teams? Maybe some Galcon AI (see Google AI challange), or the like?

Probably the easiest way to receive Bitcoin donations (and free of charge if you are a registered non-profit), would be  . They can handle the money processing for you and pay you out the appropriate amount in your currency of choice. I haven't used it, but it appears to have pretty much everything needed to setup easy donations and give you receipts as well.
As for advertising, well, that's not really Bitcoin-specific, but of source posting information about that on this subreddit and so forth would go a long way.

Yes, BitcoinQT does that for anonymity.
One can still draw some conclusions from wallet activity as to which addresses are in the same wallet - if you send money from 2 addresses at the same time, they are most likely from the same wallet. Also, whenever you send someone BTC, that person can easily see if that transaction generated any change, so that is also known. With Bitcoin there is no 100% anonymity, just strong pseudonymity - it is hard for someone to find out who you are based on just the addresses if you don't reveal your identity elsewhere.
I would recommend you do a full backup every few times you send money from it, say, 10-20. Keep your previous 2-3 backups as well in case one or two of them get lost or destroyed. This way in worst case scenario you will still have a backup from 60 withdrawals back and you will still have your money with 40 addresses of backup.
Again, you don't need to update all of your backups, just backup your updated wallet.

With the popularity of Bitcoin growing, those outputs would be a really small percentage of active unspent outputs at a given time.
Mining those coins would be disruptive to the future economy - imagine spending say, 10kBTC now - that could make the price drop by a lot. Now extrapolate 100 years into the future - that will be a fortune.

I discovered Bitcoin during the big rise up. At the time it was a bit of a gold fever - checking the price chart often, going to online calculators and seeing how much one can profit.
After Bitcoin's price was down, I heard a few people saying that it's for the best, that it would allow more services to be developed with more "sane" prices and less hype. I think it was a good thing that Bitcoin lulled afterwards for some time - it wasn't really ready for prime time at that time. It was like the technology went from a small flame, through a big explosion into kindling ambers, waiting to get up when the time was right.
I spent most of that time working on my research into Bitcoin, concentrating mainly around the Bitcoin StackExchange and avoiding the forums for the most part (too much noise for me personally). There wasn't much going around there asides a lot of insight into how it all works.
I didn't doubt Bitcoin would succeed eventually - the concept was too good not to. I didn't invest too much into it, bought a graphics card and did some mining, it blew up my power supply so I stopped.

Yes, they can pay you out in Bitcoin as well as USD. There are no setup fees or anything, so you can pretty much start accepting money as soon as you get your account confirmed. I haven't used it for anything in practice yet, so I am not sure how hard would it be to setup some ticket selling.

When someone points out that they have a problem with your service, you can take two routes:
- Tell them they are stupid because you know best
- Thank them for pointing out that in their eyes there is some problem with your service so you can address the issue
Thank you Mircea for calling me an idiot and expressing that:

Voiced my concerns in the Foundation forum:
If you can tell a difference between different coins, you destroy the fungibility of Bitcoin - making them less like money. Also, it wouldn't make much sense since rarely would you have purely tainted or pure coins - if someone creates a transaction with 90% pure coins and 10% tainted coins as input, would you consider that transaction as a redlist candidate? How about 99% and 1%? What about block rewards that earned a fee from processing tainted coins? This would be harder to track.
Moreover, I think the "redlisting" of coins is a slippery slope. Here is how things could progress:
You start with informing people of coins that were used for crime
People start discriminating against tainted coins
Someone from the US government would have the bright idea of redlisting coins that passed through wallets of "terrorist organizations", so say Wikileaks gets redlisted
People that don't know better can't tell a difference between coins redlisted for crimes and ones redlisted by politicians for "war on terror", so they discriminate against them both.
Term "terrorist" or whatever is the flavour of the month gets extended to more and more organizations that are inconvenient for the US - Anonymous, some foreign journalists that report on war crimes, government of a country that is "at war" with US or "harbouring terrorists", etc.
Soon the redlist becomes a political tool - we start discriminating against the grey area. Say some place does research on human embryos or human cloning in a country where that is legal, but since some western country thinks that their law trumps over regional law, they start redlisting their addresses.
Transactions and addresses are started to be added to it indiscriminately because some government agency says they are tied to this or that crime. Whoever is keeping the redlist can't say no since they have some order from the agency, and they can't tell anyone why they are adding those since they have a gag order.
Soon you start having a currency controlled by the political powers of one country that houses whoever is making the redlist since they can muscle their way into controlling it.
The current system might not be perfect, but trying to implement something that dramatically changes the anonymity of Bitcoin shouldn't be taken lightly.

A hot wallet means one that is sitting on your server and is constantly sending / receiving coins. A cold wallet is one that is usually offline and only transfers money on occasions. You use hot wallets for petty cash, and cold wallet to top up the hot wallet when it runs low. It protects you from losing all your money in case your server is hacked.

I would suggest watching videos like [Money as Debt]( and possibly two other related movies from the same guy - Money Masters and Secret of Oz. They explain how our debt-based economy works, where does the money come from (hint: it's not printed by the mint), and other interesting things associated with it. Generally, it shows in what deep trouble we are and how unaware of the situation everyone is. Contrast that with Bitcoin, and you have an interesting chapter on economics.
You can discuss the problems associated with PayPal's monopoly on online money transfers and the impact it brings to the people that are left out (many countries). Bitcoin does not discriminate.
Then there are the issues of oppressive or oppressed governments, like Argentina and Iran. People are forced to use a currency that is getting more and more worthless by the minute and it being illegal for them to do anything about it. On the flip side, they can use Bitcoin and enjoy more freedom.

In most situations, not really. If you don't propagate a conflicting transaction within seconds it is unlikely a double-spend will occur.

Compare that to Visa chargebacks that can happen a much longer time after a purchase occurs and suddenly what Bitcoin does isn't looking so bad.

Bitcoin might need more day traders, but not everyone needs to be a day trader.

1) [Block header]( which contains the root of merkle tree of all transactions, as well as other information about the block
2) No, Bitcoins are more like ledgers or cheques - they describe a sum of money, rather than be like bills. Bitcoin TRANSACTIONS on the other hand each have a unique ID constructed by hashing them
2.b) A collection of transactions associated with addresses owned by a person. The right to spend them is granted by digital signatures (sort of like signatures on cheque, only using math)
3) [Here]( is the exact data. It mostly states "Here is a list of previous transactions I am using. I am paying to the following addresses the following amounts. Here are all my signatures".
4) There has been no precedent surrounding it, but seeing how FinCen wrote regulations classifying Bitcoin as a digital currency, I would not be surprised to find the answer to be "yes". At the same time, it can be harder if there is an address collision (only possible with brainwallets and other non-standard address generation methods) - one did not steal a private key to a given address from a person but generated the same combination themselves.

Governments can and have banned owning of gold. They have also seized private property, executed political oppositions and what have you. Does that mean you can't count on having any rights? Does that mean you should just accept what your government will do to you without protest? No.
Any government that would want to outlaw Bitcoin would probably also go against private cryptography and other means of allowing people free, uncensored expression over the Internet. Such actions should be fought against.

There was some interesting quote somewhere - "When you're on a jet plane, running forward to be faster then everyone else is pointless." or something like that.
@_date: 2013-03-14 07:59:19
Some things to help you learn:
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:47:19
Here is a clarification of what is what in an address:
Private key is a big random number, like this:
Public key is generated from that private key using predefined equations:
And Bitcoin address is generated from the public key and is just a way to shorten it:
It is not possible, however, to do these operations backwards. So going address -&gt; public key -&gt; private key is impossible.
We send money to the addresses (although we can send them directly to public keys). The owner of the address in order to spend the money must declare "this is my public key associated with that address..." (anyone can check that condition by generating an address from the provided public key and checking that they are identical) and "here are my signatures to authorise the use of this money" (which is done through electronic signatures).
Electronic signatures appear to be strings of gibberish, but:
* They are unique to each signed message (change one byte and you change the whole signature)
* Having the same inputs every private key generates a different signature
* On top of that, if you take the signature and the PUBLIC KEY, you can verify that the private key associated with the public key did indeed sign the message WITHOUT knowing what the private key actually is (crypto is beautiful)
Meaning that the signatures are verifiable and not forge-able (either creating a fake signature or copying an old one and using it) without the private key theft.
By signing a transaction one does not reveal their private keys, just the public ones.

You could use paper wallet with a split-key vanity address, with the second key being a simple brainwallet.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:57:08
Yes, that's your address. Posting that only reveals that you own that address - people can't take your money, but they can see how much you have in that address. You can generate as many addresses as you want, so you can store the rest of your money someplace else.
You mean the bitcointip bot? You can read the documentation on it on how to tip an address.
@_date: 2013-03-08 11:40:39
Because that is one of the purposes of money - to be a store of value. If I work hard in what I do, I want it to be represented when I would want to get something expensive. Without storing value we would need to spend money as we earn it, making it very bad for long term investment. 
Domain names are not money - their purpose is to make it easy for people to access an IP address of a given server. Hoarding them detracts from their usefulness - it encourages one to take all domains that are easy to remember and either charge premium for them, or require the developers to use less attractive domain names making them harder to remember for the consumer. It is similar to gold, silver and what have you - they are very useful for all sorts of electronics, but since most of them are just accumulated as a store of value, it drives the price of our electronics up.

So I am guessing you are seeing your random number generator with current time and then getting your random numbers from it using something that is not a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator. This could be a potential vulnerability (provided someone will discover the way you randomise your cards they can recreate the condition of the game in theory).
Moreover, that is not provably fair as you have not proven anything - You could be changing the deck during play for all we know. If you want some help as to how get closer to being provably fair you can message me and we can talk business.

where x is the size of the dictionary. 100 bits of randomness is about as secure as you need - the strength of the algorithm used for BitcoinQT's wallet.dat is on that level.

My rebuttal (I hope it posts itself as a comment to the article at some point):
"Well, you are assuming the velocity of other currencies is bigger than with Bitcoin. However, I don't think there is any data about that. How many dollars have a velocity of zero?
Early adopters are at an advantage because otherwise Bitcoin would struggle with adoption. Selling more coins or moving them does not increase the Bitcoin potential - one can still convert the same value into Bitcoin and use it, they would be just getting a different amount of coins.
I think the main issue here is whether people are willing to spend their Bitcoins on goods and services that accept Bitcoin. That is more beneficial than just selling your coins, as it supports Bitcoin merchants and helps to grow the Bitcoin-powered economy."

$10k for a 1 on 1 tournament is still a decent amount, and our subreddit will be mentioned along with other supporters. The decision in the end belongs to TB - the drive did say that the money might not be used for this event. It's probably for the best - 12BTC is about $10k, which is a round number. Since donations could be growing more and more over time, the posters would have to be constantly updated.

A good video, but one major objection I have is their analysis of destruction of Bitcoin through coins being lost. If only a certain percentage of bitcoins would be lost, the amount would asymptotically approach 0, but never reach it. Since bitcoins could be infinitely divisible (with protocol change), the economy could run on a fraction of bitcoin without a problem.
Asides from that, it would be interesting to see the analysis of amount of bitcoins not moving over some time. I would bet the amount is decreasing in the recent time, as people would value their coins more.

Bitcoin is not a licensed software, but a set of rules on how to communicate, a standard. HTML is not a software, but a language. There are pieces of software that enable you to use Bitcoin as well as HTML, but they are different from the protocol themselves.

Because the rest of the network would reject the solution and their money would not be spendable.

It is a standard, so if there are any forks in the network you can be pretty sure this client will be the first to be updated and on the correct fork. By maintaining a full node you are helping the Bitcoin network a little, especially if you have incoming ports open. If you are a developer, BitcoinQT appears to be the only installable client with RPC commands available.
In other words, there are some advantages to using it, but they are very specific. If you are not a developer you probably are better off using other clients if they have some extra features that are appealing to you.
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:16:13
How long does something have to be around and of stable or increasing value until you would consider something a store of value?
I personally use currency more or less [as defined by FinCEN]( - "the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that [i] is designated as legal tender and that [ii] circulates and [iii] is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance."
And money [as Wikipedia describes it]( - "Money is any object or record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given socio-economic context or country."
In my definition all currency is money, but only some types of money are currencies. With this definition, Bitcoin is money, but not currency. Gold is not currency and since it is not " generally accepted as payment for goods and services", it isn't that much of money. Bitcoin is also struggling with this aspect, but as more merchants accept it, it becomes more and more like money.
So I think we have reached our conclusion here. We each have our own standards for what money and currency is, and depending on what measure we apply, Bitcoin and Gold may or might not be currency and/or money. I agree that Bitcoin needs to vet itself over a longer period of time before it can be a replacement for gold, but in the current digital space, there is no better candidate for the title at the moment.
Thanks for having an intelligent and rational conversation on this topic.

I think the fee will not be really decided by the users, but by the pools and the miners. They have the ultimate say as to which transactions to include in a block and not. Once they set their fees, we will have a clear indication of how much we would need to pay in order to get our transaction processed. X% of pools will process it for a fee of Y. The lower the Y, the smaller the X.

* lets people easily arbitrage bitcoin across multiple exchanges.
With the money transfers between exchanges being faster means less opportunity for arbitrage. I doubt Bitcoin - alt-coin exchange volume would be big enough to warrant much attention, making it pretty useless for arbitrage.
* This stabilises and evens out prices
Only if the volume was important enough and the alt-coin's price was nor essentially pegged against Bitcoin. Most likely it would end up being in a close relation to one another due to the high arbitrage, making it useless still.
* adding another layer of anonymity
Exchanges are not meant to be anonymous due to anti-money laundering regulations. Unless you are talking about exchanges that would only trade crypto and operate without regulations, whatever authorities you would want to remain anonymous from would already have access to the same type of information.
* I'm not a fan of most alt coins but litecoin and namecoin deserve more love and respect
Namecoin for its unique use, yes, but why should Litecoin deserve more respect in lieu of other alt-coins?
* I would love to see more bitcoin services incorporate litecoin for the reasons stated above.
Start your own or promote those that do, don't just beg people to acknowledge your beliefs.

You get them instantly, but the coins need to mature for 100 some confirmations as far as I remember before they can be spent - this is to prevent double-spends in case of some blocks being orphaned.
As long as you have broadcast the newly solved block and it propagates through the network, you will be credited. If your wallet becomes corrupted due to sudden power outage of the computer, there might be a problem with spending those coins.
You can use as many computers to mine at the same time as you wish - only one computer needs to run bitcoind and act like a pool, while others would be simple miners connecting to it.
Your wallet is a file on your computer that is generated at random - you can (and should) backup it regularly to protect your money. You can move the wallet between multiple computers without a problem - just copy it as any other file. You shouldn't be using the same wallet on multiple computers at the same time though - the files will start drifting apart and grow different from one another over time. Best use a given wallet only on one computer.

You should create the other wallet based on how often you want to spend money and how secure you need that money. For going to restaurants or buying some knick-knacks online, using blockchain.info should be good enough. Keeping some small floating balance there should be safe enough - you don't have to move money back to savings account all the time. For some larger purchases, you probably should use a client you install on your computer.
You should keep the same wallet, just do a new backup. Old backup could still have access to some of your money, but the newest operations might not be there.
I know that's the case for BitcoinQT, might not be for all wallets. Generally, you'll have 100 addresses to use. After you send money each time, your change will be sent to a new address. Each time you use up an address, a new one is generated and added to the "backup" pool, but eventually your backup of the original 100 addresses will run out.
In other words, keep the wallet (as long as it hasn't been compromised), just do a new backup regularly. Keep a few backups in case one or two get destroyed.

If there is a sustained 51% attack on the network, bitcoins will probably become worthless. Asides from that, there is nothing that can stop two people from transacting in Bitcoin, so it will always be able to be used for any monetary transaction over the Internet.
USD, on the other hand, [s created by debt]( With every new dollar created, other ones lose some of their value. Eventually the inflation will catch up, another economical crisis might creep in and you won't want to be using USD and thus be unable to buy your bread with it.
Scarce commodities, such as Bitcoin, are immune to such inflation, as it is impossible to dilute their supply.

Well as I understand it (I'm still learning more about the system), Ripple as in the network is decentralised. Ripples as in the currency is at the moment mostly in the hands of its creators, but will get distributed out. There will be some gateways between real world currencies and Ripple, they will form a distributed system. Money exchange in the system will be decentralised.
So, it's a bit less decentralised than Bitcoin at the moment, but in the long run it should be similar.

If you meant to say "communism" instead of "socialism", you could've said "communism". It's similar to people using the words "currency" and "money" interchangeably when they are not the same.
A lot of words related to the Soviet Union have been warped during the cold war propaganda, that's why it's important to use them properly in context, rather than as a pejorative term disconnected from its meaning.

Public disclosure of balance is an unfortunate side effect of decentralized nature of Bitcoin. As everything needs to be transparent, so do the balances.
However, you can spread your holdings over any number of Bitcoin addresses. Holding 1 or a million addresses is just as easy.
If you want to cover up your balance, use a separate address for each transaction you make (I advise using the standard client for this, blockchain tends to reuse the same address). This will ensure people will have a really hard time discovering how much money you really have.

At this price, I would recommend him to contact some ASIC manufacturer directly for some bargain bulk price - either Butterfly Labs or Avalon. They would probably be all ears for such an investment.
GPU mining has high electricity cost so it won't work, FPGAs have high upfront cost. Generally, ASIC or bust.
At the same time, putting such kind of money into just buying BTC could potentially spark a lot of new investments into the system and double the value of the purchased coins pretty quickly. If your father has a few friends similarly interested in such endeavours, they can drive the price up quite significantly.

Ripple is not completely decentralized as Bitcoin is, there is no denying that. However, you don't need to use XRPs for anything other than transaction fees in the system, which are quite small (at least at the moment). The thing is, there are other advantages to the system that I found to be really interesting and innovative.
Ripple is a completely different beast from every other coin out there, we have to wait and see how it progresses.

I don't think there is a strong enough Tonal community anywhere to support it. I don't even know if there is anyone but Luke that can operate in that system in the community.
I also wonder how this system will change if Bitcoin's precision will be increased by any factor in base 10, rather than base 16. Normal Bitcoins will work the same, Tonals might have problems with representing 0.1 satoshi. Alternatively, that new unit will become the new bitcoin-bong and the definition of 1TBC will change.

Characteristics of money:
* durability
* portability
* divisibility
* fungibility
* limited supply
* acceptability
* intrinsic value (mainly added by gold bugs)
If you have one thing that has 5-6 characteristics and one thing that has 6-7 characteristics, which one is more like money?
Portability does matter - gold is more portable than say copper, since the same amount of value is transferable in a smaller unit of weight. Acceptability matters, since you need to spend it somewhere - otherwise it can be like trying to use pigs as money in a muslim country.

As long as your backup is secure (you have it in more than 1 place and all of them are safe) and password protected (in case of wallet.dat backups), you should be fine. You can import it again at any time and BitcoinQT should be able to read the information from it just fine.

No, and no. Wallets are created locally, and only the local machine verifies it. Until an address is a part of a transaction, nobody cares about it.

Bitcointalk is it's own community. If you're a newbie there, you are restricted to the newbie subforum, which isn't all that great.

Well, it would still be a problem if you come across that one wacko that would take it all seriously and ruin your day by complaining about the payment you made being made up of tainted coins.
Then you can come across people that would promote, say, Sharia Banking and not want your coins since someone used them at a place that is not clean or something.
All in all, I consider it a waste of time to be tracking what the coins in my wallet came in contact with. There are many more problems that are of actual value that spending time on banal things is not worth it.
