Also... in said computer case, I stashed a wad of 4000 euros that my sketchy ass boss paid me in cash, which I ended up spending on a fine for "drink driving" around Munich - in reality, riding my bike home from the beer garden at 5am... LOL ...so yeah, I'd definitely be putting that in BTC, given a second shot at 2010.

Looks like he is deep on an acid trip, stuck in a loop trying to comprehend the otherworldly figures that keep appearing before him, melting away into nothingness, again and again.

It was a good investment then and it is a good investment now.

Around that time, I was living in Germany, was big into building computers and was interested in distributed computing. I had an i7 2600K @ 5Ghz with an OC'd 7970 Ghz and ended up running Folding @ home for several hours each day instead of mining Bitcoin, as I didn't see Bitcoin being worth the electricity/hassle... fuck my life haha!

No, it's just the new transfer system. Transactions take a few seconds regardless. If you had a UK account and I sent you something now, you'd receive it by the time I finish posting this comment.
"Faster Payments Service (FPS) is a UK banking initiative to reduce payment times between different banks' customer accounts from the three working days that transfers take using the long-established BACS system, to typically a few seconds."

Takes a few seconds for a bank transfer in the UK, doesn't matter the account. For example, when I pay rent to my housemate, I hear the received notification on his phone before it even says "sent" on my banking app.
