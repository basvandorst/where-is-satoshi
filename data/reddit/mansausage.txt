My portfolio went down 10%, but it is still higher than 2 or 3 days ago. Yeah, it is fine. These things move cryptos from weak hands into strong(er) hands.

Thanks for the insight. I know, our Siemens is currently way better, I have that in my portfolio too. But according to Kostolany, investing in a struggling Behemoth is a great idea long term. The new management of GE seems promising so far.

Where is the part where a portfolio is created and life gotten together?
Don't Americans have plans where you invest a certain amount in whatever stock or ETF you like each week or month?
I built an impressive portfolio in little over a year. Stocks, cryptos, P2P loans, an Emerging Markets ETF...
Best stock so far: Netflix. Worst: General Electric.
Will keep buying GE, great turn around candidate now.

Since there is no physical value it's not investment but pure speculation that it will be high in "2-5 years" again.
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:19:50
Well, the book differentiates between defensive investors and aggressive investors etc. etc. so it's of course all a lot more complicated than I could possibly explain here. (Even if I had finished the book already, which is not the case at all.)
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:58:48
"An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."
I'm still only near the beginning of his book, "The Intelligent Investor", because it's not easy to read for a German IT guy (reading it in English of course). But I'm already convinced that this book is exactly what I was looking for. I'd recommend it to everyone.
One of the things I can recall from what I read so far is that it is vital to know when you are investing and when you are speculating. And keeping the budget for speculating separate from everything else. Just saying, because people here talk about "investing" in Bitcoin and how Bitcoin was here to stay and would go up and up ultimately and bla bla bla... when we're really all just speculating.
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:05:34
My problem is that I have neither any BC nor a lot of money right now. So I wonder if I should wait some more or just get half a coin now already...
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:12:13
A piece of code is still not the same as a company's factory, even when it's "limited edition" code. ;)
"An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative." 
So, yeah, this is what I'm currently looking into. And from that point of view, BC is nothing but speculation. Nothing wrong with that, but people acting as if it was a sure thing and a proper "investment" is downright dangerous. In my opinion, at least.
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:46:01
Yeah, I know, I know. I read quite a bit about value investing etc... which is why I know that blockchain process or not, BC still is just speculation.
For that very reason it could easily double or triple my money within months, though. Undervalued stocks usually don't do that, at least not the well known ones that are save.
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:06:11
Yeah, but putting money into a new business's stock would also be speculation from how I understand Ben Graham.
Value investing is getting stock from companies that have been around forever and are unlikely to go, and getting that stock when the market panicked so much that the stock value is even below what the company's factories and trucks etc. etc. are worth.
Sorry for the simplistic explanation, as I said I'm still only at the beginning of the book and also not native in English.
//edit: That kind of investment usually only gets you 6-8% a year, though. So, yeah... BC can double or triple your money in months if you get lucky. I mean, that fact alone should ring some bells that it's speculation.
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:00:43
Hmm. Nah I'm not that sure about the double digits. Below $200 might be possible, though, don't you think?
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:48:32
I'm saying that the fact that the total number of BC is technically limited doesn't mean that BC can only get more valuable over time. There is no guarantee that BC can establish itself, even though people here go on and on about how BC was spreading and getting more accepted etc. etc.
Yeah, exactly. "Many unknown variables." I'm not all that far into the book "The Intelligent Investor", but from what I read so far BC is definitely not an investment but speculation. (The book is quite conservative, though. I don't mind if you guys find that outdated, but for me personally it's not outdated at all.)
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:09:41
Yeah, I mean like factories and trucks and everything that would definitely still be of value if a company shut down. Sorry, I'm not native in English, so sometimes I kinda suck with the fancy words that are really specific.

Women leave the risks to men, then eventually show up to demand the benefits from the men who made it. Just like men built western society to the point where we have infrastructure, insurances, rule of law, office jobs... and at that point women suddenly start demanding all sorts of things. It's all evolution and it is annoying that everyone is supposed to glorify women at all times. They have really bad traits, just like men, but differently.

You can lose up to 100&amp; you would gain over 200&amp; just to reach the all time high.
So if you think, for example, that there is at least a 33&amp; chance it goes at least back to its all time high, it's a good idea to buy or hold.
I hold.

Here in Europe we almost had a recession in late 2018 already. Once that recession happens, the EU will have nothing reasonable they can possibly do, so they might try something radical.
Which is why I have most money invested in US stocks, gold, cryptos, P2P loans,...
A little while ago I even started to shift to buying my stocks via a UK broker directly in the US. SO that my stocks are not being held in the EU... not in reach of our politicians.

It's very common in all western countries that people seem to believe society only progresses in a linear fashion.
In my opinion it is actually an advantage that the US is not as socially sophisticated as we are in Europe. In America you see problems right away. Here we cover the symptoms with tax money, but with an aging population I wonder what will happen when this stops working.

The people obsessed with USD value deserve to be freaked out.
I look at my portfolio, it is still around 37% BTC, around 25% ETH etc... and still well over 20% of my invested money, which is still more than I would actively try to achieve.
People who wanted things to keep going up like crazy obviously have no clue what the are doing and probably no other investments. Because anyone with a portfolio and a certain asset allocation will understand that it was worrying how much cryptos grew out of proportion.
By the way, I see no reason to sell any cryptos. What I wonder about much more is how much money to put in stocks each month. Turn it up now that the Euro is $1.24 and stocks dipped... or will the Euro go up more and US stocks dip more...

Well, here in Germany my great grandpa walked to a factory on foot for 2 hours, worked there for 10 hours, then walked 2 hours back. For 6 days a week. Meanwhile people were dying of all kinds of funny diseases and being the first to take a bath in the same water was a luxury.
I'm a common man, but I am also invested in more than 40 companies from all over the world. I come from nothing and it is people's fault when they rather consume their money than to invest it and live with the risk and volatility. Anyone can freely access information online nowadays.

A few rockets onto the mining farms and there is no more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:31:43
Yeah, which is why Bitcoin is extremely unequally distributed and nobody wants to spend it anymore.
Don't get me wrong, I like Bitcoin. But if the economy was based on Bitcoin or anything like it, I'd recommend preparing for the imminent civil war.
By the way, you are free to invest in gold. It's funny that you think gold was all that stable, though.
You realize that the pre 20th century world pretty much sucked?
