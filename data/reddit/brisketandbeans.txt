@_date: 2018-01-01 15:02:37
I don’t think you read the question. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:58:11
Sounds tacky. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:07:42
Good luck trying to time the market. But I agree, buying the dip is ideal
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:24:31
I hope you’re right!
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:20:06
Uhh, plenty of free tits on the inter web already...
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:14:34
Thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:11:18
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:29:26
Lol a bad news day. Zoom out at least 24 hours!
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:12:43
Miners fee won’t affect buying it. You can buy whenever then wait to send it. But idk when that good time is for fees. A great question!
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:43:31
Every time someone asks if they should buy btc for others the overwhelming advice is don’t. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:22:34
If you think this is just because we’re talking about it then this is a true pyramid / Ponzi scheme!
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:40:38
Looks like btc is dying, better sell
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:40:51
Good lesson to learn. When you learn the hard way you never forget. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:53:40
Can I send from coinbase to a segwit wallet? Any considerations there?
Edit: and what about sending from a segwit wallet to coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:25:38
I wish there was still a drinking game like tulip mania. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:47:06
A trade is a taxable event if you made money. If btc goes up and you don’t sell, then no tax. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:53:41
My dad just calls them bits 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:49:47
Then they should not be investing. Tell them if it’s their money it’s their problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:25:43
Makes sense. Is there a good segwit guide? I probably need to just google. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:12:20
This would decrease the value of btc
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:53:01
That is very similar to my portfolio composition. I still have 6 months to get to long term capital gains. Hope I can hold on that long!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:13
I thought futures start this Sunday?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:45:12
Buy now and later. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:51:50
Lots of shorts could push it higher in the event of a short squeeze!
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:11:11
But it will happen super slow in fiat. When crypto dips it dips HARD. People that have more than they can afford or stand to lose panic, especially when it’s their first dip. You don’t know what the roller coaster feels like and how you’ll respond until you’re on it. It happened to me with ethereum. The lesson was well worth it. I’ve more than recovered. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:45:34
Perfect comment!
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:36:49
Don’t do this. Don’t get your coins and taxes mixed up with theirs. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:19:05
Whatever keeps me out of jail!
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:45:45
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:48:08
Or she could lose it all. Tell her that. It’s important. This is risky. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:05:08
A person who makes a comment like that would have never given the btc in the first place so the scenario is not relevant to them. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:18:29
I would say no. It is still very difficult to use. Requires a very high degree of computer literacy.  
@_date: 2018-09-29 09:49:53
A money themed hublot? I bet it’s more gaudy than usual. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:59:36
When you buy btc with usd, the usd does not disappear. It goes to the person who sold the btc. They probably put that usd in the bank. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:39:27
It’s not adoption if you’re doing it and they aren’t. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:16:49
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:35:08
Yes. You need lots of help. Maybe start reading articles on investopedia or any basic investing site. Doesn’t have to be about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:46:17
So funny they put the btc sign with the lotto signs. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:46:46
Sounds like he should not be investing in btc. Tell him no. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:47:38
Exactly. It will all be fine until it takes off one way or the other. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:37:18
You go through every single transaction one by one. In the US anyways. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:21:17
I love wsb!
@_date: 2018-05-02 01:57:23
Whoa. That’d be cool. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 03:02:51
Paragraphs. Use them. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 02:41:19
So you want btc whales to move in to exacerbate the housing boom?
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:36:16
What is a "recycling bitcoin" ATM?
@_date: 2018-10-20 02:44:08
That’s not true. You can buy the same shit they buy. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:49:10
Would you use it?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:05:29
'There is no juice... my escrow fee is the juice' 
I'm not a lawyer. I don't know if it's legal or not.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:49:03
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:14:19
Yes, I got verified through the app!
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:25:02
Yes, that is the worst case scenario. Also we could get into a nuclear war or die in a car accident this afternoon. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:04:00
That's not how any of this works...
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:24:17
Whenever you measure or analyze a market and then act on that information, you change the market
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:06:48
This is the definition of trying to time the market. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:54:31
This. Split it into multiple buys
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:35:16
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:45:40
Terrible idea
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:53:25
Since this is public knowledge, isn't it priced into the price already?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:09:37
It's called being a bookie. Vegas does it
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:09:35
I don't see why they would create it and then hand the power over. If they created it, that would be like saying the US dollar is bad, use this other thing. So I think it would be bad. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 02:52:26
Reading comprehension. Lol
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:28:44
You’re under arrest sir!
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:26:00
Yearbooks as in the book with pictures of everyone in the school that year. Designed by students. I guess you’re non-US?

Next Tuesday 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:23:42
No one thinks snap is good anymore. A few of us did when it IPOed. Looks like we’ve all been selling ever since. I did a long time ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:45:25
Me too. Was crazy. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:29:51
Fractional shares? Who cares? That would change nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:12:49
Take advice from no one! But read a lot of stuff written by people!
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:47:40
Do you plan on giving btc to people that have less btc than you? Do you think others will want to do that? That’s your answer. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:41:24
He’s assuming 15% per week growth and buying 500 per MONTH, not week. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:40:35
The US doesn’t invest like we do. They just operate off tax revenue. Otherwise could be bad conflicts of interest. Even worse than there already are. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:43:06
It’s worth like 7650 right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:33:12
Thanksgiving eve
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:32:51
‘Low risk’ - ‘assuming it goes tits up’. I have a lot invested also. This place is an echo chamber. Don’t kid yourself that this is low risk. This is high risk. I have a lot invested and plan to invest more. If it falls on it’s ass instead of tits up I’m prepared for that also. I love that phrasing though, ‘assuming it goes tits up’! I hope it does!
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:37:31
It took me forever to get verified also. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:45:26
At 0 you can get all the coins for maybe a dollar. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:08:20
Yeah, there’s buy gold commercials on tv all the time. All you do is call the number. No google required. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:45:00
Just do it. $5 is trivial. That’s less than lunch money. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:03:48
Lol, “not much risk”. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:12:01
This theory is sound. Execution is difficult. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:36:46
Don’t get a loan for investing. It’s a bad habit. You need to develop good financial habits. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:25:50
Most people don’t even participate in their own 401ks. I doubt they’ll jump through the hurdles to get into btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:24:50
Agreed. I’m just agreeing with you. Btc is complicated to buy and use. Gold is much simpler. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:16:08
It would be cool if they could make transactions clear in minutes. It’s annoying to see transactions pending for a day or two. 
Edit: fiat transactions is what I mean. So there’s no confusion. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:14:00
If you think someone deserves a stake then go ahead and give it to them. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:19:20
I agree. It’s not the new investors selling their 0.1 btc. It’s big money moving it. We’re just along for the ride. Just like the stock market only on steroids. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 03:40:03
No. There’s supply AND demand. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:20:47
Do you think he got Uber rich by not caring about making money?
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:18:40
The spike to 19 or 19.5 k was soo fast the app I charted with smoothed it off. It was crazy fast. Always take investment win stories with a grain of salt. They’re just like big fish stories. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 03:03:59
It does when ‘increasing demand’ is assumed. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:03:29
You make a good point. I cannot see the future. Because of that I’m thinking of returning to boglehead principles. I was arrogant to try to take a short cut through speculation. Though I did come out in the black. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:11:37
I guess you’re right. But, I feel like we might be missing out on a good laser disc analogy...
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:20:31
What is tether? I see that word often. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:35:46
It's like this article was translated by a computer to something else and then back to English. I assume it started in English, it's all about English companies. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:18:45
Doesn’t matter what you bought. Matters what you sold. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:58:21
Your hands are an asset. If you choose to sit on them or ‘hodl’ them, should you be rewarded for that? Or should you be rewarded for using them to add value to something?
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:42:26
Lol, this is too perfect
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:01:30
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:16:42
It's a lesson in risk tolerance. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. The same happened to me. When I panic sold I bought btc. It got me back in the black. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:32:37
But the product provides value to your life over that interval. It’s why you have whatever device you’re using right now to be on reddit. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:07:22
No they aren’t 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:52:18
Are you trying to convince people not to sell so that you can sell for higher? Good strategy. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:24:56
I’m all cashed out now. I made 4x the returns had I left my money where it was before. Sure was a fun roller coaster. I was an idiot. I invested more than I could afford to lose. Thank goodness I didn’t lose. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:25:58
Good point. We clearly have mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:59:17
Yep, buy high and sell low. It's super simple. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:49:31
Yes it is. I'm happy to sell you some at that price. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:39:21
Over beta max. I was pretty young then. It was similar to blu Ray vs hddvd 
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:44:06
And that decentralized trust is as volatile as teenage love. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:24:46
Yeah, definitely not 23. Such a shame. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:50:00
May talk to a tax pro. Could deduct the losses from the lost coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:10:45
Whoops, typed that backwards. I'm an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:40:37
You must be loaded if you know how to time the market
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:26:15
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:19:19
Lol, full adoption. People are seeing their friends lose money. Will they adopt?
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:03:42
If stocks drop the first thing I’d sell from my portfolio is this crazy crypto. The stocks will be fine. Are you awake this week? The Dow dropped 3% or something. What is crypto? Case in point. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:49:34
Don’t have to mess with wallets or getting set up on an exchange. It’s kind of a pain messing with btc. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:48:25
If you’re scared, half now, half later. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:11:10
I would
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:08:26
No one cares. We’re mostly trying to make fiat, not btc. That was my goal. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:50:52
If you have a resource and don’t use it, how can someone else use it? If that’s the case then the resource was never yours. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:59:00
Ok, see you there. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:40:33
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:15:25
Why are you writing the numbers all weird like that?
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:42:37
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:47:37
Fortune the magazine is pretty good. Idk why their website is so terrible. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:27:41
You sound pretty confident about your info. Go for it. Hedge away. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:15:05
I had to check it this was r/bitcoin or r/buttcoin. It really is hard to tell sometimes lol
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:22:49
This is good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:14:43
Sounds like a bulletproof plan. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:45:16
Yeah, I noticed the second that had the master public key had many more addresses associated with it. The first had only one. Thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:18:02
I had trouble with this also. My handwriting is bad. Couldn't tell if a b was a b or a 6. The real issue for me was I thought a v was an r!
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:16:35
Thank you for the help!
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:30:53
No. Because I got out already. There’s no we. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:21:35
Do it.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:49:29
Ok mcafee...
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:40:05
Yes. Everything about it is difficult. And after last years run, now everyone has heard about it. There’s no more greater fools left. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:19:24
Oh shit. That kind of thinking for me in trouble. Get out.

There’s a gas station outside of Greeley, it may be in city limits, with the most amazing breakfast burritos. All the oilfield guys stop there on the way to work.
