Market manipulation is just what's always going to happen in a free market.  Why WOULDN'T you pump and dump for free cash off the backs of those who are not insiders?  I think everyone here would jump at the chance at free, legal money.

You don't use your bitcoin for purchases?  Then what's the point of the supposed "currency" for you?

You realize the majority of our energy usage is still from burning coal and shit, right?  As energy usage increases without some renewable sources of production to back it, we're going to burn more and more coal.

Nothing secure about people taking their machines offline as the cost to operate outweighs the benefit...

Er... People who bought yesterday got a WORSE deal.  It's tanking again.
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:16:08
Huh, weird.  If I had to pick one of the hundreds of cryptocurrencies to choose as an eventual currency, personally I'd throw my money behind one that doesn't have exorbitant energy costs that will make using it extremely expensive.  But, to each their own.

Ah yes, everyone accept the banks!  Accept them into your home.  Accept them to your dinner table.  Let's all be more inclusive!
@_date: 2018-05-26 18:12:26
Why do you say that will happen to Bitcoin specifically instead of one of the coins with better energy usage?

Ford was like 6th, not first... He was just the first to have the mass-production factories with assembly lines.  
Ford wasn't even the first internal combustion engine and steam based cars existed long before that.

Catch the falling knife please! My speculation is losing value!!!  
You guys are silly sometimes.  It's either being used as a currency and the price really doesn't matter (don't hold. But, use, buy use etc...) Or you are just in it for the Moon and are trying to pump it up.

Market manipulation - pump and dump.  If you can't beat them, join them! Easy money...
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:48:43
All things considered? It stopping and going to zero.  Lots more coins with better tech on the market.  What sets Bitcoin aside as the one to succeed?  The fact that it was the first mainstream one?
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:50:56
Don't kid yourself. Almost everyone is here to get rich quick.  The huge drop in value is not a positive.
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:43:07
I hope this is a joke.  The whole idea behind Bitcoin is that it allows us to make shitloads of money from market manipulation.  If you can't beat them - join them!

Almost no companies held bitcoins.  They were immediately converted to USD upon receiving them.  
In addition, the cost to send Bitcoins was at like $50 recently.  No one wants to pay that shit.
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:38:29
You're not diversified at all.  You got greedy and got burned by it.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:14:11
For you, maybe.  A vendor just wants USD and if accepting Bitcoin becomes extra work at all, it's just going to be dropped.  Reddit has no desire to bother with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-28 06:43:05
The fees were $50 a pop just a little while ago.  When people actually use the service, the fees are fucking ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:26:06


As it continues to drop.  Lol.
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:39:43
...you realize your Bitcoin speculation has zero effect on wars, right?
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:42:22
Stock market has regulations to prevent manipulation.  Crypto literally has companies advertising pump-and-dump cycles.

If you want to insult someone, at least try to pass your 2nd grade English lessons first.

Please do not listen to this guy.  This is tax fraud and could end up with you in prison.  
Every transaction is a taxable event.

This guy is going to wind up in prison for tax fraud.  Holy fuck what he's describing is so fucking illegal it's not even funny.
