It seems to go faster since I started watching the bitcoin price. :)

That would ROI around May 2016.

You can forward gmail to any email you want.

I'm getting tired of these stupid blockchain not bitcoin one-liners.  The blockchain lives for as long as it can be secured and bitcoin helps incentivize and secure it.

You're trying to mine on a laptop.  Mining on laptops hasn't been profitable since 2010-11.  Maybe the pools you are trying to use see your insignificant hashrate and then deny you because you make zero contribution to their pool.
  
Mining has moved to specialized mining hardware using ASIC.

**ALL CLOUD MINING IS A SCAM.**

Adrian said they **sent bitcoin directly to an address known to be selling fake IDs.**
  
Really far in the context of this discussion is the transaction from coinbase to known DM address.  Full stop.

I don't think that is a good comparison because email is not a financial instrument.

You'll get your account closed and sent to collections.  Your credit will be impacted if you don't pay it back.

Congrats!  I've found the best way to tune out is to set a price alarm on my smartphone and to stop checking the price and this sub.

If I bought a physical bitcoin like a Casascius coin, I would not buy one that had a password for the private key.  It's hard enough to trust that you have an authentic casascius coin without having to also trust that you received the right password for the coin.  Encrypted private keys destroy the resale value of physical bitcoins like Casascius.
  
Now more to your question.  BIP38 is good enough that you can trust the world with your private key as long as the password is *strong* and *unique*.  Someone around here posted an encrypted wallet with only 4 characters for the password and nobody was able to crack it after a year until the person who created it gave away 3 of the 4 characters for the password.

No banks and you can't price goods using bitcoin.

Cloud mining is a scam.

What pressure?  How has the federal government applied pressure?
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:08:18
They admitted to no such thing.  You're editorializing the headline here and not providing context.
  


  
Your bank cant monitor your cash withdraw.  If they could, you can bet your ass they would.
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:53:21
It doesn't have to be bitcoin and I don't think I would put all of my savings into bitcoin if I was Greek.  If I had money in the bank, I would put like 20% into bitcoin and withdraw the rest.  If Greece defaults, those Euros will still be worth something and the government is going to try and take them from you.

Anonymity.  This is very important to Satoshi.  He could have stopped before ASICs and still have mined another million using CPU\GPUs.
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:08:02
Cash serial numbers are tracked but not at the consumer level, there is no system in place for them to monitor cash once it leaves the bank.  
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:25:46
  
This is an epic response from Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:47:55
I think the idea is that if you are Greek, you buy now before your country goes bankrupt and institutes capital controls.

They can buy from coinbase.com

I've seen those same anecdotal submissions here but not in a long time.
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:19:17
Satoshi could have been mining the whole time and could have enough coins not attached to him that he may never have to touch that first million.  For all we know, Satoshi has been cashing out coins for the last several years.
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:54:15
This is rather surprising since firearms are legal and Coinbase and Bitpay are both American companies.  This is very un-american!
@_date: 2015-06-17 23:47:29
Why do you fear Chase terminating your account?  If they do that, it's a favor to you because it tells you that you shouldn't do business with them(I personally think you shouldn't).  There are plenty of other banks.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:29:18
It's not a good parallel when you're comparing two totally different things.  But I get it, evoorhees has his fanboyz.

Several months?  The price hasn't been above $600 for almost a year now.

Greeks use the Euro, you need to go learn about the eurozone: 
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:54:55
HODL and forget about it.  You paid back your debt and I'm guessing you don't need the money, so take a chance.  If it fails then you broke even but learned a ton.  If it succeeds, you're going to be euphoric and happy you held out.
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:53:46
Go find out.
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:44:12
It's not like they showed up and gave out the persons personal information.  The customer was on here slandering coinbase and coinbase defended themselves without exposing their identity.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:57:12
The point you seem to be missing is that you do not use a traceable transaction for your illegal activity.  No one with a brain does this.  You can try and make this the fault of Coinbase but it is no one's fault but the idiot who got caught.
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:12:36
You are not very bright.  Of course you cannot delete your account, they are required by law to hold onto your information for up to 7 years.
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:42:13
It is true with caveats.  You can only store something like 40 bytes of extra information at a time and it has to be a certain format and there is no way to store it in any kind of contiguous way that makes it easy to connect it all together without an outside reference.  I'm sure there is more.
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:48:04
That's a huge markup, you can get them for much less on eBay.

Bottom is not in.  We are going to 220 this weekend.

haha- thanks!

HAHA!  If this is true, this is hilarious.  Why are people so dumb!
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:12:38
That is not a fact unless it can be proven and there is no proof of that.  That was a reply to another user and those were their words.  Here is the context.

They are totally different in the way our expectations are formed from history to modern day practice.
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:34:24
I had two too but I just had them tell me to choose an account and stick to it.  They said they are doing this to everyone who has more than one account. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:52:37
Isn't this just common sense?  There is a reason people use cash for illegal activity and it is the same reason that drug dealers and criminals don't accept american express.
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:34:58
How about you don't fill out the form and stop trying to put your mistakes on someone else.
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:23:46


  
This implies to me that he has a new one.  What is it?
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:09:09
No you don't - not verified accounts using the same identity.
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:04:47


@_date: 2015-06-16 20:04:28
You have to provide a private key to the producer so they can add it to the physical coin in some way.  Go to bitaddress.org and generate an encrypted wallet and provide the encrypted key to the maker.
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:54:08
I personally think you are full of shit.  Coinbase responded to your accusations and they did it in a way that did not expose your identity.  I believe you fucked up and you're now butthurt that you got caught and are trying to make them look bad.  Don't make the same mistake with circle because they adhere to the same rules as Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:55:13
Nope.  Bitcoin is good money and in order to use it, they would have to buy it, their ability to pay for things is what has them in this mess to begin with.  Bitcoin isn't like fiat where they can just print it.
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:45:15
Couple weeks ago, I imagine cross referencing millions of accounts isn't exactly easy.  I have a very unique name too, so that may have made it easier to spot.

It is true.  Connect using VPN, Tor or some other method of obfuscating your hosts identity.
