Sorry. I made mistake. Koinex have terminated. I wanted to type Wazirx. It is P2P. By mistake I typed Koinex. Thanks for pointing out.

Wazir X. Or local bitcoin. It is very easy. If you are not worried about kyc just go for wazirx. Easily there portal matches your demand and you will get your BTC. Payment is held in escrow until you confirm that you have got your coin. You can buy many coin. You can also opt for local bitcoin. Com.

Show some notification given by the government and surprise me. Whoever told you it is illegal in India does not know anything about BTC. He must be the one from the group who believes BTC is ponzi. 
Note : Notification shown should have the word ILLEGAL. DYOR and go to any online tax portal and get information as to how much tax you have to pay if you gain through selling crypto. There is tax slab. Now tell me government is charging tax on illegal thing.

It is a fake news.  Only to get subscribers.

Why do u want to hide your coins. I am from India. It is not illegal to hold or buy BTC. Just banks cannot engage in this activity. You can buy P2P. Store anywhere. Preferred is hardware wallet.

Looks like we are in a bull market again. .....After 2 weeks oh ! It was just another pump to dump again. Oh! That time I missed seeing that BTC had not crossed 8000$-10000$ to be in a bull run.
@_date: 2018-02-16 09:41:30
I have to say. You watched the video very attentively.
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:53:53
Why did u turn the screen upside down. Just type 1-btcusd and the chart will turn upside down.
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:45:35
Such an old meme. Still gets upvotes.
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:44:57
That was really great and funny at the same time. Nice 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:26:45
Waiting for things to turn positive. May the FUD end soon
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:09:54
I also believe these levels are good to hold 
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:07:15
Hope it does not cross to the other side of the stream again. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:28:36
Zero after a number is very desirable. It is not greed but success.
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:44:50
The Bitcoin community is thankful to you for what you did for us. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:44:57
Bitcoin has the Big Bang effect for sure coz it gave birth to so many cryptos and now we call it crypto world.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:45:36
I agree 
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:03:32
Let the bull come and hit all the FUD.

Jaxx is very good wallet.  Don't know why people say that keeping big amounts is not good.  It is BIP32 wallet.  What's wrong in it.  If something goes wrong with jaxx why can't people retrieve there coins in some other hardware wallet with same pass phrase.
