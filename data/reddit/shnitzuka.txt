I don't see a need for Bitcoin specific regulation there. We should be demanding that exchanges make legal promises to not fuck with our money. Wouldn't that be enough?

Well I recall seeing credit given in the description of this particular youtube upload. To me, just the fact that I know who you are now, shows that you should have left them up. Would I have discovered you otherwise? Maybe. The point is, the more instances of your work that are saved on computers globally; the more chance your work has to survive and the more chance you have of being known. If I were an artist (and I consider you a sort of artist) I would want my work to exist in as many places as possible to both benefit the world and ensure my immortality.

According to their site they want to move to ASICs.
"The Havelock Investments Mining fund seeks to provide a consistent monthly dividend by investing in and maintaining Bitcoin Mining equipment with a heavy focus on FPGA (and eventually ASIC) technology. For the first few months, our dividend will be approximately 50% of total mining revenue, with the other half going towards expenses and reinvestment in new hardware. The eventual goal is to increase the dividend over time."
Does this change your views at all?

That's one of the draw-backs of bitcoin. It's so easy to make a quick decision that you can't take back. I stayed up late one night and blew 20 btc. Luckily I got the 20 back months later, but in most cases I wouldn't. Another good reason for paper wallets in a safe I guess.

You're making a really strange comparison. In most societies today bank notes are generally very important for determining an individual's wealth. By counterfeiting bank notes you are decreasing the wealth of everybody who uses them.
Spice World is a work of art. The Spice Girls created it to share with the world. Yes I'm sure they expected to make some money and I'm sure they did. But no law should guarantee them financial reward for their art. If people can/want to support them, then they will.
Some people bought the VHS when it came out but don't feel like paying a second time for the dvd. Others downloaded the torrent first, fell in love and then wished they could send btc directly to the Spice Girls but couldn't.
Really completely different situations.

Think of it this way. Every business that uses bitpay (or other processors) is one less reason to use bitpay.
Say at first all you can buy with btc are drugs. As a carrot seller you're gonna wanna use bitpay. It lets customers use their wacky new payment method with no cost to you. You have no need for drugs, nor btc.
Then there's a shoe salesman. He decides to accept bitcoin. He doesn't want drugs but he's crazy about carrots. He decides to use bitpay but keep 1% in btc to use for carrots.
When everybody uses bitpay, nobody has to use bitpay.

Sally and Joe already know about btc before this card ever exists. They just don't feel comfortable accepting a volatile currency that takes days for them to turn into groceries. Then the card comes along and it takes minutes. Now they feel comfortable accepting btc directly at their businesses so they can spend it indirectly at the grocery store. I don't care if the grocery store knows what bitcoin is. Baby steps, man.

K I think the problem here is I haven't done my research on colored coins. My understanding is it's just a small amount of btc that indicates something special. 
So are you saying the torrent client can only download the file once its address has the colored coin?
Who assigns meaning to colored coins? Can this all be embedded in the .torrent file?
I feel like paywalls are a little silly because they'll always be worked around either with a modded client or someone uploading an unrestricted torrent. Right?
I love the idea of donations through bittorrent though, and embedded suggested tips perhaps.
Also how would it be easier to verify ownership of a colored coin than to verify payment sent to the artist's address? Again, I'm falling asleep sorry if idiot.

Okay, thanks for sticking with me here. When someone sends me a colored coin there's no transfer of keys though as I understand. My key is my key, so how does this scheme work? Unless they're sending me privkey, but then what's the point of the coin, and how is that sent through the blockchain?

I've been thinking of doing this for a while. I'd probably only want to do it to my girlfriend though. Or if I did it to anybody else I'd keep a backup at home and put an expiry date on the piece of paper.
Of course, as mentioned elsewhere, there's the problem of them importing the wallet and keeping it there. A QR code linking to a helpful website is probably a must.
Also definitely leave an appropriate fiat tip and leave the btc as extra.
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:22:33
It's stressing me out. Both because I have a LOT which is crazy and because I could have SO MUCH MORE if I were an insane risk-taker back when. I'm just staring at the screen not sure whether I should feel guilty for the free money or regretful for the lost opportunity.

Joe owns a small book store. 
He's interested in accepting btc because of the low tx fees and general awesome. Unfortunately none of the stores he frequents will take btc and exchanges seem like a hassle so he decides to wait on the whole btc thing.
Sally owns a salon and has similar thoughts.
Introduce OP w/ simple btc to plastic solution. 
Now Sally and Joe can easily use their btc via plastic middleman. They both decide to accept btc directly at their businesses. And of course when Joe needs a haircut or Sally needs a book, the only currency involved is btc.

I started writing a big long scenario but it was just too long, because there are just too many possibilites for how something like this could go down.
I think important factors are good contracts, well-established neutral arbiters agreed upon in the contracts, reputation, private insurance/defense agencies.
At what point will an employer say, "this paycheck is worth less to me than my reputation, my physical safety and the cost of defending myself"?
I think in most cases it would be more expensive not to pay your employee an honest, agreed-upon wage.
I also see no problem with co-ops.
This response seems really overly simplistic compared to my first one but I would have been writing all day with that one. Ah well.
