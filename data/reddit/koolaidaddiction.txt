I saw one of these sims at a conference. It's pretty awesome
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:11:18
One of the easiest web wallets I've used
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:44:42


Yes, mostly this case. Perhaps it's a misuse of the words walled garden but the 'early adopters' club that have a social contract with JR to increase the value of MSC

You may argue that's a good thing considering how limited Bitcoin script is anyway
@_date: 2014-08-04 10:40:55
The argument was: not to be fully integrated being a good thing.

Unless it get's called back because someone 'stole' those funds from someone, sold to you?
How would this even work anyway? Say someone a) compromised a wallet, b) issued a new token, c) crowdsold the token, d) the token was traded on the decentralised exchange? Maintain a saga transaction for every savings address?

Contact Joel for the non BTC investments. He has a google spreadsheet he can share with the XCP, DOGE and MSC investments

The Vennd website does mention that multisig support is forthcoming.

I take this as a good point. Interoperability on the technical level, yes XCP and MSC do. However, from a user perspective someone in MSC can't get from BTC to MSC (and bidirectionally) automatically without counterparty risk.
edit: Yes, I agree by any definition colored coins is much more interoperable.

So why would I use this instead of Counterparty
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:58:23
The idea for Counterparty was for trust-less trades and a DEx which can trade against BTC.
There is no binary black or white when it comes to trust. ie Good vs bad despite what people say (same as centralization/decentralization). It is a gradient of grey.
Trust, like centralized services will always have a higher efficiency/simplicity than decentralized services. All have their place and the market will decide the price accordingly.

Counterparty interops with bitcoin. That can't be said about MSC, NXT etc
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:06:57


Isn't this the same argument you tried to use against vennd? You have to trust the person to send your tokens.

The point was on utilization. Are there any established businesses that have issued colored coins and are using them actively?
Don't get me wrong, I really appreciate the work of Colored coins and Freimarkets. I have nothing against them despite my devil's advocate style posts here :-)
If Counterparty didn't have the adoption and utility that it does, I would 100% support projects launching on colored coins.
However, from a business point of view, liquidity is what will make the platform successful.

Whilst both use the bitcoin blockchain, MSC transactions are walled in the MSC garden no different to NXT. To get into the garden, you have to trust someone. In XCP you can trade for XCP for BTC on the DEx. Granted it's not the smoothest but no one will run away with your funds
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:16:17
Yes and the gold can be traded on the decentralized exchange and Poloniex and Melotic
@_date: 2014-08-04 10:20:02
Is the restriction only for the initial send from the savings address, so I send it twice? What happens if I receive MSC from 2 different savings addresses? How does the co-mingling work? It seems to me that the confirmation time for MSC sent from a savings account just went up to 30 days.

The point made above was you have to trust the issuer. There's no practical point having trustlessness for the vending machine when the issuer is sitting out there with 1,000,000 extra tokens.
Vennd will move to remove what little trust is required already. But that doesn't make any difference in the end as the issuer is the point of failure.
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:02:46
I think every other platform is 'dominating' over colored coins in terms of utilization. Even between Ethereum and colored coins, it's a tie isn't it? Are there any established businesses that have issued colored coins and are using them actively?

Screenshot that address in Counterwallet to prove it and you may get a present ;-)
