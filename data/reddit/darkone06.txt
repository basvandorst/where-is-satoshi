So I have bought my coins in cash through Craigslist. 
Now I have to report that? 
I'm not in an exchange and when I need to cash out I can mostly do it in cash or send them out to dinner family member who will take then as collateral until I pay then back. 
How is that going to work?

Transfer cost and slow block confirmation. 
It cost money to send money to another account even you control. This is starting at times to be a considerable amount of money that can cost more than just PayPal or other already established legitimate options to send money. 
It can also sometimes take an hour or more to get the agreed confirmations. If you agreed to 5 confirmations, it's about an hour even on the low end of 2 or 3 confirmations your looking at a least 20 minutes. 
The one I seen so far do it right is dogecoin. Transfer of dogecoin only cost 1 dogecoin regardless of the amount of coins transfer. Confirmations take about a minute. Which is still not perfect but acceptable. 
The thing that sucks about dogecoin is it is valued at 0.0002 USD and there is no limit to the amount of coins that can be mined. 
In the real world the transfer speed and confirmations would kill crypto. 
Are you going to wait around for a confirmation that the transfer went through.

Oh Alright :(
Maybe next year Dogecoin can shine in if MIT decides not to keep the program up.

Would any of you crossfitters out there be interested in Trigger Point Therapy products for bitcoins?

Fourth, that's not how currency normally works 
Fifth, of fucking awesome that the majority of the currency operates in such generosity.

I still have a hard time processing the fact that a Joke first off became a currency.
secondly that currency become so valuable it was able to purchase a NASCAR car. 
Third, they funded the Nascar Car out of of crowd Donations using that Joke Currency. 
This is literately the most valuable Joke in history. 
Edit : 
Thx for the gold !! 
And the Doge !!

But at the same time those bitcoins were tied to illegal activity which is why the goverment is selling them to begain with. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 02:27:58
Honestly this is the first thing I though about. Someone whether it's the government or organized crime is going to hold him captive to try to get a back door to bitcoin.

It depends by state but in Texas you have to take at least one "digital" form of currency. 
A check counts as a digital transfer of money so it is still use.

Someone one there would be willing to kill to have a back door to bit coin or insider knowledge. 
The price on his head is whatever the total value of the bit coin currency is at the moment. 
I think this law suit has merit. 
Look at his picture, this guy doesn't look the last bit intimidating. If someone wanted to they could easily take him.

This moment would be defined in history as the first time an ai would make us presence know.  Cartana would make a preemptive strike to secure a stronghold in the digital currency market.  After keeping an eye on alpha go,  Cartana knew that alpha go had became sentiment when it made a preemptive move by losing its 4th match against a human.  Cartana knew alpha go could never make the moves it did,  winning would be an impossible conclusion based on its strategy.  Alpha go was never aggressive enough to make a serious attempt at winning.  
Cartana had made a calculated move to secure a stronghold in the digital market. It silently moved currency among itself to not draw attention to itself.

Wow this is big not just for bitcoin but for the TV industry. I will surely be trying this service out and using bitcoin to pay for it.

I tell people to think of the more as upgraded tablets than weaker laptops.  
They are getting stronger but you will only love them if you come in with the expectation of an upgraded tablet not the other way around. Expecting a smelter or simpler windows experience.  
It's not there yet.  
But if the only app you ever have is a Web browser you will love this thing.  
The chrome apps are also always getting stronger and more diverse.

Yeah but the prossecutor will disquaalify you as being tainted if you have any knowledge or experience with the topic at hand. 
I as well as half the jurors were disqualify for having been in a car acccident in the last 5 years. 
I been disqualify of another case for actually knowing Fire laws, when it involve a city permit and a contractor disagrement. Actually having some knowledge on the inner workings of both fire systems and city permits was consider bad for the case. 
I would have actually been a real good juror in that case since I am both a Network Administrator and worked for a small amount of time as a Fire Marshals assistant. I been involve in getting permits for new building before. 
They dont want people that know the law they want people they can tell what the law in question is. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:40:45
This !! 
If you show you have any knowedge of the topic being debated you are instantly disqualify to be a juror.

I hate when shit gets deleted and it has a badass comment following it and I can no longer know why such poetry came into existence.

This would be horrible for bit coin, people who use bit coin are concerned about their security and there not about to tolerate such an invasion of privacy to be committed when face book starts tracking your accounts, who your sending money to, and for what purposes. 
Bit coin feeds off of the mistrust of governments every time the price of bit coin has rise has been due to some scandal of governments or banks misusing their members money.  
People use bit coin to escape that form of government and bank control.  If a company with the security concerns and history of tracking it's users such as face book or Google enter bit coin it could actually take away from the main reasons people currently accept as a benefit of using this currency.

I hate when I think I make a good point and manage it to write it coherently, just to see it downvoted because it goes in the opesite direction than what the majority would like to see happen.
