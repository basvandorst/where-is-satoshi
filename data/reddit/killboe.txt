I checked the receiving address and it shows nothing was received. I just got scammed didn't I?
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:50:05
I don't know if it's synced or not. I don't know how to check txid on a blocks explorer either. I sent it mindlessly and it was stupid.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:52:45
So I have my keys, now what?
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:01:19
Is there any way to get my money?
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:59:29
Does anything change if I use a legacy address or a Cash address?
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:54:33
Here's what showed.
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:57:46
Wait, bitcoin.com receiving address? Or coinbase receiving address.
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:37:19
Also, how would I buy anything with an Electrum wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-28 04:08:48
because you cant buy anything online with a bitcoin.con wallet

Well, to not look like as much of an idiot, I don't have the seed anymore. I haven't used this wallet in 2 years and I got a new computer. So no, I don't have it. So I'm guessing I'm going to have to wait a very long time.
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:05:42
Yes it was generated in the legacy wallet, here's how it looks like.
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:08:57
Maybe because I sent BTC to a BCH address? Idk
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:36:53
Yes, I sent BTC to a BTC address.
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:41:01
Gee, thanks for the help
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:38:27
The transaction is already sending like I said. So far 0 confirmations. So I would have to wait a very long time I'm guessing in order to get the BTC in one of my wallets?
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:02:26
I FIXED IT, Turns out, on the [Bitcoin.com]( app, it only shows the BCH Wallet, so I did some snooping in the settings, when to the recent transactions on 1 of the 6 wallets I have, and it showed up. Thanks for the help man.
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:02:31
They're BTC

Ok, I ran it, but the "private key for my address is not known"
