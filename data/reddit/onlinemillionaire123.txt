I meant last year lol. It still feels like 2017 lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:42:50
It loses value. Lost a lot of money on it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:24:35
After today he may not have a wife. lol
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:48:54
What do you think 1 bitcoin will worth 40 years from now? At that time 1 bitcoin will be rare and I have a feeling it is a good collectible. Who else thinks so? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:39:20
And tether lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:00:41
It took them a month to verify me earlier this year. Be patient. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:00:30
What if bitcoin crashes? their currency will be dead lol. In crypto it doesn't matter if it is backed by petro or air. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:10:34
It is still ok. Once you retire you don't need to pay a lot of taxes on capital gain. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:54:40
Gemini is down and been down for many hours. Bots are on Gdax buying and selling. The crash must have been big to cause the exchanges to behave like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:54:06
No. I am about to leave BTC. I rather get free money from stocks even though the % is lower. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:22:48
How come bitfinex is selling BTC for 13,900$ now and Gdax at 14,814$? Gdax bots buying the coins obviously. Who would want to buy now. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:37:27
Today is the day for a major correction. Fear of price crash from futures tomorrow can make people fearful. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:59:12
You better hope George Soros is not investing in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:30:59
As soon as people stop selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:35:17
Now it is time to sell. You will buy at the bottom. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:00:39
In futures, big drops in price cause super massive gains if you don't know by now. If you own enough bitcoins you can cause this drop. Simple logic. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:42:50
I have a feeling the price is going to drop down to $3000. Future markets will not put any money in bitcoin as others were saying so I think this pump was just for the futures news and now it is going downhill. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:27:33
Gdax is down now. Something is wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:23:12
Coinbase makes money from volatility. People keep buying and selling more and more. They kept the price at 15k today for hours even though it was crashing really fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:04:44
it is up now. it went down because price crashed a little but price is going up now.
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:00:44
Satoshi is nobody. He is gone just like God. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:11:22
Crypto come in cycles. Now the cycle reversed. If you predict the real dip you can make big money. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:05:45
There is high chance of making profit in long term. Bitcoin is too risky and you could lose all your money over time if everyone decides to sell. Companies have to go broke for this to happen so it will always be better in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:38:09
Me. lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:06:18
Bitcoin price was constant for hours but just now it is moving. I am putting no money and just watching. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:03:53
They hold enough coins to control it obviously. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:09:06
Not until bitcoin is accepted at stores. Right now it is just speculations. It is overpriced. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:57:48
This is similar to what I believe happened to the big crash in Gold commodity. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:26:53
I want you to remember one thing. Every time you see a post about someone becoming a millionaire from crypto then you have to expect a crash! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:24:09
Any send/receive over $20k get sent. We got screwed. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:15:27
Bitcoin is suppose to be PEER to PEER so there shouldn't be any exchanges. It suppose to be like on localbitcoin. Buy from each other and this is decentralization. Right now it is centralized and you can't profit unless you provide your KYC info to the exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:01:27
I don't think there is a big dip. If it happens I am buying.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:35:37
If bitcoin becomes well known (very popular) large companies will have to accept it as a form of payment. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:18:31
What if we keep them as cash on the exchange do we have to pay taxes on them? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:48:27
Last time we checked he didn't have a dick. LOL
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:24:40
Just finished watching the whole thing. OMG lol 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:19:36
Imagine the new people not expecting a drop. We will see a $2.5k drop coming. New people will be too emotional obviously. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:26:43
I want you to remember one thing. Every time you see a post someone becoming a millionaire from crypto then you have to expect a crash! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:24:45
Time to SELL IMHO. lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:50:56
The drop is because people buying bitcoin cash. Their volume is higher than bitcoin today. It is like they are competing with each other and people buy the coin that keeps going up. They don't care if it is core or cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:56:32
I transferred my coins hundreds of times to other exchanges. I can buy bitcoin from other exchanges as well. They will not know if I sold and rebought back. I didn't think they are this dumb. I think they know what they are doing so anytime you send/receive over 20k you are F**ked. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:16:18
Let's make it a big post regarding November. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:53:01
I bought a little. I wish my limit is higher. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:41:30
We have evidence from one fork in August. People sold their free coins and bought more bitcoin so bitcoin surged to a new high. I hope the same happens for this fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:14:15
We didn't get any bitcoin gold yet. How are people selling theirs already?
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:45:35
Where do you see that? and do you realize that if it goes under 75% then 2x is done? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:28:34
Bitcoin 2x might be on top. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:57:38
Yeah, that's what I thought. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:59:53
So, chance for price to go down is 66%. The big investors are taking their money out already. Little dicks HODL lol. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:20:13
Is this why people are buying btc now? if you are right that means bcc is already accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars before it exists. I really hope you all lose your money when bcc opens at zero dollars and everyone is selling because the idiots are buying btc currently hoping for free money.
