If you disregard everything about distribution and earning. sure. Good try, but you aren't an economist by any standard. Creating valuable tokens out of blockchain is the dumbest idea. Good luck trying to convince 7.4 billion people.

Plot twist; Professor turns around and kicks the student out of his class. Then tells the class *to always remember to factor in the inflation rate and time value of money over a 30 plus year period before you decide to be a smartass.*

It will never be as efficient and cheap as bank transactions;
* crypto tech requires most of the has power
* quantum computing will most likely make the current crypto obsolete. 
Bitcoin and all altcoing are serving a bigger purpose. Don't be a fanboy and enjoy the ride. Remember what your goal is? If it's not money why does everyone on this board talk about the value of it instead of other aspects of crypto. Even when off ledger or other on ledger solutions are presented bitcoin will not be a currency. It will still be a high valued asset. 
Investors unfortunately turned crypto market into stocks and that is not a good thing. You will see speculations and surges in prices of altcoins. They will keep shifting money one from the other and the small investors will take the tab. Blockchains will be useful but concentrating on value alone makes you people look as stupid and greedy as people that invest and gamble on derivatives. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:41:34
Segwit or LN, these are nothing near what is commercially feasible or efficient. 
Can someone actually calculate the computational power banks utilize in transactions and compare it to the efficiency of blockchains so far. I think in theory, having ledgers in son many sources as opposed to local hubs is just way less efficient. This is my $0.02
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:31:23
I think from an objective point of view, media does not want people getting in on this. Let's assume bitcoin is a million dollars, because that's when it can actually be used by masses as a means of currency of exchange. Can you imagine how much a transaction would cost or the time it would take a transaction to be processed. On ledger or off ledger, it would require a similar party like a bank which turn any crypto into just the money we use today. 
LN, Segwit or whatever else, the technology isn't there to scale this to a currency level. What the media says is that Bitcoin reached its limit with the the technology we have today. It's not going anywhere any time soon; a year or two. This is the potential of it as a stored value token and that's about it. Now if you look at other cryptos, there is a lot of room to speculate and make money off of just like bitcoin. That's what's happening. I believe a few currencies will reach bitcoin levels and the speculators will make their money and move on to something else. Cryptocurrency has become the new tool of the capitalist greed and you fools are being a part of it. What's really happening is far from what you think is happening. As a general rule, move your money to lower valued items and ride the wave. There is a potential of having 1700% over couple years by inflating a couple currencies at a time. Now that's a lot of return cumulatively. Step back and observe; You will see it from the same perspective. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:04:06
Well, they aren't actually doing a bitcoin transaction on the ledger for these. So there isn't much need to charge or way to justify charging ridiculous fees. With the twins' bitcoins as a potential reserve to begin with it, this is a better establishment. On the other hand they are doing what the banks always have been and if they monopolize on this, what is the point of switching from banks to crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:05:13
The banks use your money when it's not in use. Exchanges I suspect do the same but they have their shortcomings. They are new to all this and if they are trading bitcoin themselves it will take a while. Anyways, I don't like how the narrative has changed and from spending Satoshis now everybody talks about it like an asset. Even coindesk started calling them crypto assets. There are so many things wrong with this right now than right. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:23:38
Blockchains have use. Bitcoin has 0. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:33:25
So much wasted hash power...... One day people look back and say, how did they use such an inefficient system. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:10:41
Bitcoin doesn't have to be store of value. It's how it is with scaling limitations and the amount of people invested in it. If 100 million people were actively using it and the price was around 300K, with a transaction rate of 4000/second, we could have a currency. Anyways, stored value approach only limits uses of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:50:54
Until someone knows you have bitcoins :D
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:47:30
I understand the technology will catch up , but don't see it happening for the masses before quantum computing, which also opens whole different bag of worms.

Investing in a market requires calculation of risk, ROI, opportunity cost etc. This is not investment. People with 0 knowledge in economy, why we have an economy or how an economy works are just investing into this because they are promised a high return (that relies on another fool to pay more for it.) That's the definition of a pyramid scheme. It was easier to mine at first and now it's harder. Everyone getting in on this is only making the previous investors richer. The cryptocurency concept was developed to cut the middle man and actually as a currency. Right now show me one person that would spend bitcoin to buy something with the anticipation of the bitcoin gaining value as it is. Nobody is using it for transactions and now the narrative has changed to, oh it's an asset class and we'll just treat it as gold. I got one thing left to say; get the fuck outta here. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:21:48
Market cap does need to be much higher. But store of value only applies to its distribution in relation to the market cap. For example 2million people hodling bitcoin at this market cap is stored value, 100 million people actively using it on ledger transactions at this market cap is a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:09:38
Well, just to say the least, that's only so far. To a lot of investors, that unknown factor is a deterrent. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:27:13
It's the pay more to get priority scheme. Basically bribing miners. If everyone collectively agreed on paying less or if there was a fixed transaction fee we wouldn't have any of these problems. In the long term this will bring the end of bitcoin. What people don't understand is that with the current tech and rules of bitcoin we have passed what would be considered an equilibrium. Satoshi may be a genius as a cryptologist but he either didn't understand the dynamics of economy or did this on purpose to limit the value of bitcoin. Block size needs to be increased to at least 5 or 10 mb and the difficulty should be lowered for bitcoin to increase in value and become more of a currency.

I think governments let crypto roll right now to allow them to benefit from the cash flow in and improve the tech. At that point, I think we'll see a lot more government regulations/bans/taxes etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:09:16
More around $370000. It's not a currency. Transaction fees will only increase from here on. Around $20000/ BTC, you are better of using Western Union. Bitcoin has become an asset class rather than currency. For a currency look for Etherium and screw the kitties. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:49:55
* The fundamentals changed. The goal is not using bitcoin any more. It's making money. It's that simple. 
* The older investors are waiting for new comers to pay premium and it's not earned equally. You have to spend more everyday to someone that paid less at an earlier date. 
* Apart from cost of mining and development, there is no valuation so it's based on hype. /bitcoin is the source of hype and you surrounding yourself with similar minded people only adds to your delusion. 
* You cannot disprove any of the above. Good day.

gambling is always encouraged in markets. That doesn't mean it benefits people or anyone. This will blow up worse than derivatives and you are the ignorant one between the two of us. You are either feeding false information or have been fed false information. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:59:44
Don't worry, this will happen to everyone that is still holding on to bitcoin. In investment you decide when you're gonna cash in. You should just sell it and stay out.

Nobody will use a coin to buy something if the value keeps rising.

People sitting at home, doing nothing... it is too good to be true isn't it. No production no applicable use with a high valued coin resulting in high transaction fees. Only fools would fall for this. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:23:00
I understand the reasons. But that doesn't change the end result which is not efficient, effective or feasible as a currency, which would require thousands of small transactions around 5-10 dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:11:14
With no trusty exchange and the fact that people needing exchange makes this statement very childish and ignorant. If everyone was distributed bitcoin as pay and could spend it, yes. This is just the new comers making the old investors richer, which is exactly what the problem has always been all along. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:31
At this point you can make more money on a cheap crypto. Bitcoin doubling at this point requires a lot of capital. Not so much on smaller ones. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:35:33
My problem is with the block size and increasing the difficulty. I don't think there is a good balance between security and scalibility. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:13:30
You all are only making coin exchanges rich. I bet most of the trolls in this sub are payed by them. Just like the banks screwing people over, coin exchanges are taking you for a ride. There will be investigations and lawsuit and none of you will have any returns. Cash in before it's too late.

I have Euros and I want to buy a car from, let's say, Tesla, in the states. Is it the company's problem, if I don't have dollars instead of Euros? They would expect me to do the conversion and pay them. Or the bank will automatically do the exchange for you and make a bigger profit out of it. How is it different with a crypto exchange? Or what's their benefit? What's in it for Tesla, if they have to deal with a 3rd party for the transactions, which will charge them just like the banks or other financial institutions. 
What YOU people don't understand is that you're trying to implement crypto into a system which it does not belong in. It's just an inflated asset with no real value. Crypto can only work in its own paradigm. You can't just plug it into the system and say we have a new currency and you should take it. I'm saying all this considering you understand the fundamentals of an economy. Blockchain is great for security but creating a token out of it for the work and then inflating like a motherfucker based on misinformation is just a delusional state of mind.   
Last but not least; Do you understand why they are trying to have derivatives but nobody in finance is buying bitcoin? Because they want people to gamble on it and lose then get their interest. For fucks sakes being a fan boy is one thing but does anyone understand the mechanics and fundamentals of economy? 
Just like the financial institutions they are trying to collect cryptos in exchanges with these "suggestions." Crpto was meant for direct transfer from client to client. This is just bullshit.
It was a mistake posting in a sub with nothing but trolls, manipulators, and fanboys. Now go fuck yourselves.

People investing in things they don't understand is great. Until they need actual currency and nobody wants to buy their bitcoin in this particular example. I would take my profits and walk away at his point. Without the big money investing in actual crptos themselves there isn't enough small players to sustain this. For those that compare it to stocks, stocks still have a reference point; the company valuation. Gold on the other hand cannot disappear like crypto or if someone tries to steal there is law enforcement on your side. If someone from Russia steals your crypto, start looking for a second or a third job. You will understand in time. Value always has to be based on something. If crypto has no buyers / use the value is "negative" not even 0. Good luck to all who insist on keeping their bitcoin after this point.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:54:42
my pleasure. I guess you don't need actual money to do anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:22:58
And I guess nobody here understands cash flow. Is he supposed to pay wages with bitcoin or buy parts with it?
