So it happened again.  It is newsworthy.  Sometimes people miss it the first time around, or it gets buried in other headlines. And it isn't old and outdated news, as it is current information even if it something that happened once before.  If anything future posts might read **Bitcoin Surpasses Western Union...Again** to be more accurate.  Well thanks for pointing that out anyway.

Sign up for Amazon.  Sign up for Coinbase.  Sign up for Purse.io.  They have Apps that work together.  You can then sign into Purse with Coinbase.  Then you paste your Amazon Wishlist link url into the Purse search shop browse bar. Then someone across the world with ~~spare Amazon gift cards~~ *unliquidated Amazon Turk funds* will buy your item and have it shipped to you in exchange for Bitcoin at a discount of 10-30% or more.  
Edit:  After reading someone's nightmare hassle from a year ago, I would avoid Gift Cards maybe and only order items through Amazon.  And maybe avoid high price items say under 100 USD.  They seem to be leaning towards a vetting system of customer feedback similar to eBay showing # of transactions and positive negative score indicated from green to yellow to red.
Update:  I ordered some headphones and it arrived about a week later in Amazon Prime packaging.  Easy peasy.

I think Bitcoin is showing that it's more resilient than that.
@_date: 2015-12-16 01:13:26
Okay so remittance and money transfers don't count and neither do micropayments /s   or settlements for that matter 
 And what you're saying is that all Bitcoin transactions are fake and Chinese and don't count.
And it's really not an important milestone in the history of Bitcoin either /s
@_date: 2015-12-05 20:44:33
Hmmm. Not sure.  I don't think so but it's possible.  I think I remember seeing a YouTube video where it's only in America for now.

Do you mean "clears" or makes or profits? when you say "ears"?  I don't doubt it.   
 You should read the comment about "the CEO of Bitcoin" trying to figure out how to make a profit with Bitcoin and the "CFO of Bitcoin" having the final say on what should count or not.   All in good satire. 
This shows that outfits like WU are in it for the wrong reasons, like exploiting the poorest, most hardworking and most vulnerable populations who are forced to rely on them for their money transmittance across borders.  It is often the poorest most recent immigrants that need to use this.  AApolous sees this as one of Bitcoins' killer apps.  He's been saying it for years.  So I think this is significant to point this out.
@_date: 2015-12-16 01:16:35
lol good one!  
Who knows?  Maybe then we'll all have to switch to Litecoin!  
Which is fine with me!  
Especially when micropayments can't go through because the payment itself is smaller than the miner's fee to process it.  That's what you're saying right?
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:37:59
I noticed this too.  Maybe you have to cancel your order and start a new one.    Weird.  When you slide the discount from say 35% back to say 10% the price is slightly more.  Wonder why that is or if they meant it that way for some reason...

Me too.     And then proly buy real Bitcoin (NO2X) with it.  Wait, can I sell my 2x on Coinbase as soon as I get it for fiat and then buy BTC with it?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:26:52
Ahh... makes sense...  (actually confusing AF lol)     
I moved 10% of my net worth (not much) to Kraken looking to buy altcoins, but I think I'm late to the party...  
or am I?   
...still kicking myself that I wrote an article about the merits of Ethereum when it was &lt;5usd and didn't have the presence of mind to sell everything I own and buy some...lol
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:28:45
Ahhhh.  This explains it perfectly.  Serious question:  Who's going to sell their 2x coin as soon as Coinbase distributes it?  
I mean sell their additional matched forked 2x Coinbase coin (NOT BITCOIN) as soon as they get it on Nov ~16.     
And to add to this discussion, yes it will be a volatile ride for HODLers but they will continue to benefit in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:35:42
Damn, I wished I would have known this a few days ago.  I think I paid 6x2=12usd for two transactions for BTC transfer.  ETH and LTC faster and cheaper btw...   
Does GDAX have altcoins for sale?
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:40:55
This is true.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:33:22
But $3000-5000 for Bitcoin may also be happening until the fork business is over with and people are less confused.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:38:48
What about...Not until Nov 16, I got an email saying that's when the fork is/was supposed to happen....WTF did I miss?

Like what?
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:04:52
Coinbase is still the most mainstream way of buying Bitcoin.  It's the McDonald's of Bitcoin banking.    
  
One of the few alternatives is Kraken.

I would say at least 10,000 is reasonable.  And didn't John McAfee say he might do something if something does/doesn't happen?  So I dunno..100K?

What if it only goes to 10,000 or 50,000? With frightening flash crashes in between?  Just sayin...

Told my Dad to consider buying when it was @ 300 &amp; 600.00... 
Told him the first few days of May of this year 2017 to put 10% of his savings into Crypto...this would include Ether and Litecoin.

Thanks for reading.  And also thanks for posting a summary of it here.   You left some things out.
And about Wallets that aren't really wallets:  Yes I'm reading a bit more about how wallets aren't secure unless you own the keys yourself, or something to that effect.  
  Well I know enough not to keep my coin on exchanges, and perhaps you are right but when you generate an address (BTC, LTC or ETH) in Coinbase it says "Wallet."  Maybe you should take it up with them about how this might be construed as deceptive.  
Anyhow, what wallet would you recommend?  I want to say:  Electrum or Trezor, right?  I've really only experimented with Cryptocurrency, moving small amounts around various addresses:  Bitfinex, Kraken (exchanges I know) and I had a BlockChain.info addy too at one point.   
And lastly, I'm sort of interested in the new Altucher eBook about how to turn $100 USD into a small fortune in Cryptocurrency.  But I think I could do much of this research myself, though I'm interested in what he has to say.   I want to start a "value based" Crypto index, looking for fundamentally sound Cryptos to get in on the ground floor and hodl.

Dude the CEO has mined Bitcoin herself.  They are obviously interested in it.  (They bought some mining rigs to experiment with from a now defunct company.)  Well at least it's something.
see u/MidasR/ 's post


I liked this quote: "We set up a small bitcoin and ethereum mining operation…that miraculously now is actually making a lot of money,” she said.
This is going to be an interesting controversy.  Both sides:  fiat and bitcoin seem to think that one or the other is no longer going to exist.  And that's simply wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:31:10

Isn't ETC like the BCH (or SegWit2x?) of Ethereum too?
or in other words:  
BCH: Bitcoin Cash is to Bitcoin   
as  
ETC:  Ethereum Classic is to Ethereum.  
Only Core Bitcoin and core Ethereum are the real things.  Amirite?
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:02:06
Could someone explain how Coinbase is in or not in on this?  Do I extract my (tiny amount of) Bitcoin from Coinbase and transfer it to some wallet before the hard fork November?   
Only reason I'm vehemently against SegWit2X is because Charlie Lee is against it, and I would think he knows what's good or not.  
Actually, I may just buy Litecoin with my Bitcoin.

More broadly interpreting "invested" than your strict definition:   How about; That Fidelity, overseeing trillions in assets, invested the time, energy and manpower to learn about Bitcoin, enough so as to go as far as linking customers to Coinbase to track their Bitcoin balances.   
 It's kinda huge that an old stodgy very conservative financial institution, usually set in their traditional ways, and enormous such as Fidelity is,  did even this.  
The point to take from this is that it signals the incipient normalization of Bitcoin by institutions.    
Next phase is mainstream public adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:23:46
Even if it's just 1% (of Trillions) that is still significant in normalizing mainstream Bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:55:14
And that if Fidelity is "interested" in stocks that means they are "generating interest."  Or that Fidelity has a "vested interest" in either bashing Bitcoin or rolling with it.  But I digress.  Sounds like  you spend more time picking apart other people's posts than contributing something of your own.  Well all is fair in civil discourse I guess.    
Maybe it's uncomfortable that Fiat and Bitcoin have more in common than we would like to admit:  for instance, starting to act like corporations, with ICOs issued instead of stock.  
And besides, it was originally reported in TheStreet, so it *has* to be the gospel truth.  /s

I see what you're saying.  It depends how you look at the chart and what period time frame.  Anyway it's a pretty good wedge shape since 2011, and it's shaping up more steeply as the number of transactions multiply.
@_date: 2017-10-07 05:31:51

Look at the number of transactions per day chart since 2011.

[Coindesk Daily Transactions Chart](  
So many transactions that Litecoin may soon start to get a spillover effect.
