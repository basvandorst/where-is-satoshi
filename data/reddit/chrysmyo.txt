Just like every democracy we know of. Either your in an empire, EU, Russian Federation, Chinese Republic or American empire, or you're a Neocolony balancing the will of the Empire against the will of the people.

Tell me what anarchist haven you live in? Every country, to some extent is going to make a play at bitcoin, most democracies have their limitations, especially in the modern context.
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:10:17
Are you making my point for me? 
Im saying that just like every other country's America's is severly limited. Unless they live in an undisclosed anarchy haven, they are limited by the same exact democracy. 
For example the five eyes. If they live under these 5 or directly opposed to these 5. They have no more safe a Democracy then the US.

Theres 2 things at issue here.
As a society, we suffer from assuming a smart talking head can Transfer their knowledge to other topics. So all these media outlets searching for content to monetize will reach out to anyone who fits under the category of "expert". Likely, all these economists are incredibly smart at a very granular and particular subject within economics but now were asking him to predict market prices and predict and understand cryptocurrency. 
If the economist's analysis on bitcoin is the main feature of the article and that isnt currently working within academia in a dimension that accounts for modern computing, networking, cryptography or even just electronic banking, I stop reading. 
I dont think many mainstream writers know the actual *aim* of crypto. They are looking at like all the bitcoin users are really chasing lambos. Which to be fair a monstrous mass are. But the underlying reason and feature of the currency's existence isn't really creating wealth. Its removing the job of currency from states with walls and borders and its aim is to empower its users in a decentralized manner. 
But most analysis is focused on forecasting lambos.

Sophisticated technical analysis is just an extra layer of abstraction over the foundational principle, buy low sell high on long term investments. That's all there is to it. Humans are just using computers to narrow down the near, endless choices they have and maximize  effiency at the transactional moment. 
Yet and still, if aliens landed tomorrow or one of the Newtonian laws of physics was disproved, you could throw away every buy/sell algorithm on the planet as human behavior will irrevocably change.

Whoo, dodged a bullet with that one lmao. 
Discounting the people that were hurt by the incident, it does help to have events like that early on as it helped late comers like me learn about the perils of 3rd party intermediaries.

Almost exactly my experience. 
I hadn't heard of it during it's beginning. Wasn't plugged into tech like that. 
Heard it's name come up during the Silk road shut down. And assumed it was just a token like Xbox points or something. 
Finally started studying the technology. As I was studying and mulling it over, I started seeing quasi-spam on my IG timeline about people supposedly making hundreds of dollars day-trading. 
Figured oh fuck, too late now... 
Then now I see the price and I'm starting to think.... How do I buy this stuff again??

The difficulty adjusts down though. If the blocks begin to take too long to solve. Just as it has maintained about the same time to release a coin as more miners join, it can contract as more miners leave.
So If major miners leave. It incentivises individual people to mine coin again. Until the price settles and mining businesses can project costs and profit again.

The foundation is thus:
They are predicting the actions of humans. 
They are not predicting the value of something naturally occurring. They are predicting the cost that human beings are willing to pay for something. 
This is, by it's nature, unpredictable. As you cannot predict the actions of one human. You cannot predict the actions of a million people. 
Now, if you're given a set of limitations or parameters, you may be able to *guess* one human's behavior. Ie. I restrict a person's access to water then predict he will drink the water when I hand him a glass. 
But it's a free market so there are very few limitations you can put on one human in this scenario. A human can make a decision to buy or sell based virtually anything. Anything. They can make a decision to buy or sell, literally based on tea leaves. 
Now, you could argue, a human being would be inclined to act in its own best interest. But it's clear that humans *dont* always act in their own best interests. Well, some technical analysts try to model out this rationality to various levels of accuracy. Let's predict the number of people who are going to buy or sell based on a random action and implement it in our algorithm.
But then as you scale from one human to millions around the entire planet. It becomes exponentially impossible as you have to handicap the randomness of each human. Then you can't account for environmental factors like terrorism, death, diseases, natural disaster, mass power outage, anything randomly occurring on a mass scale can affect the buy/sell decision of any random human on the planet. 
Humans as a herd. As the actions of each impossible to predict human begins to accumulate, the group proceeds to affect other humans. Human's who resolved to hold begin to shake. Humans who resolved to buy begin to hesitate etc. This is far more predictable but when does the trend end or subside is hard to predict. When does it begin is also hard to predict. 
Tech analysis is enticing because as you scale the number of humans. Each human begins to look like a node in a network. A data point in an equation. And as each day passes. The data looks to follow some sort of pattern or trend. 
But the foundation remains the same. Each data point is an individual person. 
If a bridge collapses and plunges my car into the water. And I have a $1000 deductible on my insurance. That may prompt me to sell my investment asset to replace my car. *Even if it's a bull market and not the rational thing to do in the long term*. Then multiply that by millions. Then multiply the group affect of that. It starts to look less rational and predictable. 
Now the reality is that many investment firms that deploy analysts really make their money through the accesibilty they have to IPOs. And the accessibility they have to the *physical* aparattus that allows the markets to function. Many have expertise in certain areas that can recognize long term trends based on the natural state of things. How much oil is available, what's the global access to fresh water looking like, what major trading hubs are freely opened, what will the Fed do to interest rates etc.

Any criminal syndicates using the block chain are already criminals. We do not need additional laws to deem what they're doing illegal. 
Bitcoin is used just like cold, hard cash. That's it, over and done. It's cash that can be transmitted electronically.

There are likely bots manipulating both sides. 
The main thing is institutional inertia. 
I also think that use cases and applications for bitcoin will be the thing that pushes it mainstream.
For context, I probably didnt get a PC until 1998 or 1999? I dont remember, but somewhere in that neighborhood. 
The first thing we did with it as kids were play a couple rudimentary CD Rom games that were partially educational, solitaire and MS Paint. 
Not to say businesses and techies weren't already moving mountains by then. But me as a 10 yr old child literally couldn't imagine much about all the things I could do with it. 
I often get jealous of those kids in the 80s that got so obsessed with computer games that they started coding and became billionaires today. 
Well bitcoin is sort of like that. The techies, the finance nerds, alt culture people are aware of its wide uses as a tool. But the simple, average user of money really cant imagine its utility. 
Basically the world is waiting on someone to put up those bumpers that people have in bowling lanes to guide users through smooth, uneventful experiences with bitcoin. 
Right now, most people view it like a security, commodity or currency that seesaws up and down. They dont realize it could leveraged to build out tools that change how we interact economically

We're still in a growth period in conventional markets. 
People still, generally, trust their money in a bank. It's been a little while since people in developed countries have been turned away from their ATMs or seen a run on bread. 
Let the tide recede a bit and expose another overleveraged government. Once regular people struggle to get their hard earned money out of a bank, bitcoin will look more valuable. People in stable countries will be able to send money to people in a crashing country with bitcoin and all of a sudden, the value of bitcoin is realized. 
I think, the near future, bitcoin is an exchange unit for other currencies. My aunt needs money quick? Send it in bitcoin. And she receives it and exchanges to her local currency. 
Bitcoin is competing against centralized systems. It's like a security alarm company trying to sell security systems in an area that hasn't had a string of burglaries in a while.

I kid you not, I bought $100 in bitcoin for the first time in my life with the last peak in June, at around $6900. 
This is my first time in the black. +$5. *I'm going to be rich, I tell ya*
Naw but seriously, I expected there to be turbulence. And I honestly expect another dip by this time next week. 
But, and this could be bias, but the dips from the month I've held bitcoin aren't quite as much as the peaks. So it seems like zig zag upward. If the next dip is reasonable, I may buy another $100

Just a half formed idea. 
But bitcoin could be a business model for whales, given this concept. 
You **spend** for product. 
Then you **spend** to market. 
Then you **profit** from successful market campaign.
Consumers are bombarded by competing campaigns looking for attention. They spend via the campaign that conjures the most emotion. 
So whales could be:
**Spending** to **buy** bitcoin *low*. 
**Spending** to **market** bitcoin *value*. 
**Profitting** from bitcoin **price rise**. 
At the same time that is happening. Whales are also:
**Spending** to **short** bitcoin** *high*. 
**Spending** to **market** bitcoin *death*.
**Profitting** from bitcoin **price drop**. 
Which ever whales can fall in sync well enough to get a narrative to stick, win the day and profit from the marketing investment. 
Also please note, that **shorting bitcoin** or **selling bitcoin value**, doesn't necessarily mean *literally* the commodity exchange itself. It could also be *experts* and *analysts*, *gurus* and *fortune tellers* looking to manifest the reality that they are predicting.

Original "Hodlers" are not traders in the classical sense. Hodlers *generally* view themselves as early seed backers of a radically new *technology*, not necessarily a stock in the classic sense. 
Think about this, what if there was monetary value in seeding the "World Wide web"? What if you were there in the 80s and your initial backing of their idea for a global network could be commoditized? Let's say your investment represented .25% of all the money used to back the world wide web. What would .25% of that valuation be today? 
In today's terms, one could argue that valuation may be nearly priceless. Almost so valuable, that selling would actually be useless. You'd likely get access to the cheapest credit in the world just by evidence of possessing it, since it'd be one of the most perpetually increasing properties known to man. 
That's the sort of category "hodlers" put bitcoin in. It's a revolutionary *technology*, the idea that people can place bets on this idea is just the icing on top. 
Right now, bitcoin just represents a store of money that is an instrument that can most easily be used to avoid remittance fees across borders. But bitcoin is one of the first concepts of **sound money** that doesn't require the trust or stewardship of a state or nation and doesn't ask that we all put our **trust** in an **individual** or **single entity**. 
In this regard, *hodlers* logic is sound. Even if cryptocurrency as it stands now is preposterously primitive, it's a genie that cannot be placed in the bottle. Decentralized, stateless currency that empowers savers and not consumers will always be useful. 
The risk, the question, the uncertainty, is whether bitcoin represents that **brand** or final form of **cryptocurrency** that will usher in a new era. Or will it be a system inspired by bitcoin? Will bitcoin be the bi-wing plane of cryptocurrency? Either way, for a hodler, even if bitcoin goes down to $0, they were part of the advent of a new technology. The guys that sort of lit up the Eiffel Tower after the invention of the light bulb. 
There is a very high chance that most investors make $0. But there is a greater than .01% chance that all these early seeders could be the people that raced to the plots that the US government handed out after conquering the West. 
In all honesty, being a "hodler", isnt the biggest risk one could take. That title goes to the people putting their savings into *monetizing* potential *businesses* around bitcoin. They cannot afford to be 30 years too early. "Hodlers" would at least have the code and "primitive" lines of code to show their grand kids, "see, I was there when the first car hit the road."
Your view of soundly navigating the *market* and selling high. Staying out til it hits rock bottom and buying in again, is the viewpoint of the consummate trader. "Hodlers" are more evangelist then paritioner.

I do think that's a flaw with the current incarnation of bitcoin..
Securing bitcoin and distributing its data doesn't **have** to be this resource intensive. Just because it started that way, doesn't mean it's the ideal way of doing things. I think a billion people making $5 a month off mining bitcoin would be far more desirable then a million people making $5000 a month off bitcoin. 
If your ability to mine *a* bitcoin wasn't directly correlated to the amount of energy **bought**, it would be more profitable for everyone **and** more evenly distributed so the whole system would be more egalitarian. 
Things like the "mining death spiral" would cease to exist as well.
