no. if  you send btc to coinbase you are sending btc.. you need send the other coin to wallet such as electron cash that supports it. from there you can send it to an exchange that supports it. coinbase doesnt even support it atm

honestly i wouldn't drop 900 today if i had the 900 to invest. always a safe bet to split it up over time. but if you can all at once right now and not worry when you are done a few hundred then go for it man because at the end of the day this is not going to be the all time high. It will keep breaking it, when that is? who knows. if you can lock it away and not look back then buy it all right now. personally i wouldnt though. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:50:13
it is selling for 3300+ rn...... I dont think you have it upadated. there is no way they are selling for that cheap
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:44:32
give me an explanation on why it is a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:32:14
you shouldn't be paying anything when you buy. you must be using coinbase. use an actual exchange (gdax, kraken, etc) and dont use market orders-- thats where the fees are. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:28:52
what exchange do you use for margin trading/ shorts
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:18:04
thought we would have a slight correction @ 3400 and again around 3700. clearly i am wrong... the books are still heavy and it does appear to still be  bullish. if it breaks 4200 it will hit 5k by September i think. there will be a lot of resistance in the early 4000s imo. i think these next few days will be interesting 
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:45:47
nothing is different. same way you always have
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:30:13
hello i am having the same problem. how did you solve it? i wrote in notepad and copy/pasted but still grey
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:12:41
so i sent my btc to kraken so i can sell bcc. kraken quite frankly sucks and i would rather have my BTC on GDAX. Can i send my btc to GDAX with my bcc staying on Kraken? or will i lose it if i transfer my btc to GDAX.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:15:18
NO ONE FUCKING KNOWS
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:26:41
yikes. another shitcoin cash troll found his way onto the this sub. \\sorry your coin sucks? good luck ever getting anywhere near these numbers.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:53:09
I prefer GDAX, the web platform of coinbase. Gemini requires a lengthy verification process if im not mistaken. I like the GDAX interface. Only thing is that it takes 4 days to transfer funds from a bank account. 
Also I use Kraken but overall, i like GDAX the most because of the simplicity.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:51:25
yah just make up bullsit info. they will say they cant find your record and all you need to do in verify your # to get basic.
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:40:25
yes basically. if its at say 4000 and you want to get in,  buy w/ a limit order at 3999.
depending how quickly and violate it is at this minute it may be jumping up to 4010 before it falls to 3999 so you may need to cancel the order and make a new one if it doesnt get filled right away. 
you could also do a stop/limit at 4010 and once it hits 4010 it will turn into a limit order. I know GDAX offers this but not sure if bittrex does.
good luck 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:11:55
im all in right but hoping we see a crash at some point. this growth is not sustainable (or is it).... also would love me some free coins
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:04:20
I nor anyone here can answer that fully. It could rise to 5k or drop to sub 3k. Personally I have a stop sell placed as I do think it will correct itself to 2.9-3.1k over the next week. Again this could be completely wrong but that is my plan. I just got into btc in May right in the mist of the major jump. Over the last few months I have really tried day trading, so some success but ultimately if I had held on from the beginning I would be up more then I am now. It is tough tho there are times where I am down a few hundred and very tempted to sell off and re-buy.
Anyways I would say invest 100 a week until you are satisfied. Or whatever number works out best for your current financial situation. 
What I will say is that I bought in at a very similar time in May. It was currently pushing an all time high and was on a very up trend. Since my purchase the price had dropped  over 1k but ultimately here I am today in the  green. There certainly will be a time where the price is lower but who knows. 
for storage- i use BIP38 encryped paper wallet. i recommend it. easy and safe

congrats beast. invest that money wisely and treat yourself

I am an engineering student in my 4th of college. Out of my entire class maybe 5 people I know hold positions in crypto (less than 10%). Outside of engineering, I dont know a single person at my university that has bitcoin or any other crypto. granted I go to a university of 30k and only know about 200 people or so but still. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:11:22


LTC &amp; VTC &amp; ARK are my big my gains.  thefun is just beginning.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:33:54
HAHA.... You my friend are delusional. Your telling me that you think the price will not drop below current price (4200) over the next month and a half. this is the greatest threat to bitcoin it will have faced since it was created some 10 years ago. the bcash FUD saw the price drops nearly 40%. this attack poses a threat exponentially higher.
 hey everyone has their market strategy, yours is clearly different. nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:36:54
my dude.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:47:48
well looks it looks like you clearly do since you took precious time out of your daily life to reply?
why would i hold when it ill crash 50% before it breaches anywhere near an ATH? lol
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:41:27
me too
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:48:56
i will be buying back in before the fork, after the price has dropped 1-2k from where it is now. same thing happened in july. this is a worse situation and naturally the FUD will be worse. it will certainly bleed
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:59:17
something along those lines. the smart is preparing. the HODL TIL I DIE noobs will watch the price crash 50% and rejoice when it returns to the normal, at the point ill will have double the coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:50:18
not sure if freaking out is the right term, more like preparing to gobble up bitcoin when it falls to sub 3k again.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:35:48


hows it looking&gt;
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:46:48
dude relax its $8, your profit margins are so low. it goes up another $1000 and you get $5-7. Nice, you might as well sell lemonade outside your house too. 
I sold out too after a gain of 100s. It will correct itself over the few days and I am going to buy in again soon. It will reach 3k+ within the next weeks and right now it is below, so as far I am concerned, you are still profiting at any purchase right now.
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:59:13
what do you use to buy/sell? I want to sell and buy but hesitant as I get hit with 10% transaction fees.
