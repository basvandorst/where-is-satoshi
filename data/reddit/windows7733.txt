Inflation is a form of tax to those who had bolivars in their hands. The most affected were the rich people who had massive amount of bolivars. Many of them, those with retail stores still operating in the black market, business providing services, merchants who had all their transactions made in bolivars, are quickly buying bitcoin because dollars are scarce in here.

It operates in bolivars, but people charge the equivalent of USD in bolivars.
Bitcoin isn't used to trade goods in massive quantities. Bolivar is still used in most cases, but what it means is that people receiving bolivars probably is recurring to bitcoin as a storage of value to save their revenue from hyperinflation, hence the rise of bitcoin volume. Only those with huge amount of bolivars are using bitcoin, but then there are those who know about bitcoin minning it and also gaining it from trading and work from internet and faucets
Dollars are extremely scarce in Venezuela.

There's a functioning black market where people can have access to food, goods. Products come from other countries and sometimes they are grow in here. Bitcoin as successfully helped those who risk their investment in Venezuela to keep operating in the black market.
