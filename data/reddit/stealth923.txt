So don't go around touting that XCs tech is superior to anything out there when it's closed source and previously been ripped to shreds for rev1 on how immature and shit the design was.

You are kidding right - making claims on it being the best when not a single person with any authority has laid eyes on its source...thats false advertising...you are trying to justify that its been verified by someone who creates a pretty graphic and by the dev himself...bias much?
I would bet if this was reviewed professionally by a gmaxwell or kristov atlas that it would be thrown in the rubbish as I can already see multiple security holes already that would make you go back to the drawing board the same as in Rev 1...

Let's be honest, bitcoin would never implement and fork to include these features. So no, altcoins are not doomed. At most they would include a side chain.

Please explain how it isn't trustless - I have been reading up on DRK..It is a fully trustless solution? It isn't your typical mixing service.

This was covered and answered fully by the Dev - there was no premine. Do your research and stop publishing misleading information.

Indeed - tested this myself, I had 4 second full transaction confirmations!

No because Bitcoin doesnt have Masternodes - Darkcoin Masternodes is what gives the ability for Instant Transactions + more

When bitcoin integrates Instant Transactions, Hell will freeze over.
Good luck ever forking Bitcoin with this feature.
In the meantime Dark continues to innovate and take market share!
