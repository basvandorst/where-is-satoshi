100 bits
I am broke, sorry :D
@_date: 2014-12-30 22:36:56
Yeah, just wait for someone with more expertise on Bitcoin to explain.

This. Plus total privacy.

I am actually working on a site for bitcoin donations. I would really appreciate it if I got it :)
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:11:51
Ah good luck ;)
@_date: 2014-12-30 22:32:52
Sorry for your loss buddy.
My first tip!
give this guy 100 bits.
@_date: 2014-12-30 22:21:48
Does it appear on the site?
Above the current balance, there should be the unconfirmed amount.
If it's there, you have nothing to worry about.
And by the way, it's highly addictive, so watch out.

Wow! I could use some funding for my new bitcoin related site: 
The widget is in full restyling. will be published tonight.
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:08:52
That's great.
How much did you get for it?
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:27:02
The idea of the site is that it creates a widget for sites owners that has their bitcoin wallet.
Instead of the traditional "we accept donation, btc address: ***".
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:14:18
I don't know about the site. But you can always use to make the exchange.

Ha. ha. freaking typo.
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:48:31
Watch out for scammers tho.
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:33:54

Check their rep profiles. Only deal with people with multiple trades!
And when trading over PM triple check the trader's username, impersonating is really easy and common in there.
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:05:35
Thanks for doing this buddy!
500 bits
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:48:10

Awesome! I wish I could attend. Too bad I live in Morocco.
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:43:58
Just bought 10 Moroccan Dirhams ($1.05) with $1.47 (~40% fees).
Got it in less than 3 seconds! 
Great service!
