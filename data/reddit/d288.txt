Banfield is alot nicer I work just before crossing to capital federal, and transportation will add up next year (since the rent contract ends and they wont renew it),since Im 1.5km away from work i can walk for now.
Edit: painted lots of houses with my dad around Banfield, one was a woman with a husband from the USA, was years ago I remember them cause she wanted the living room painted 2 walls in purple and 2 in chewing gum pink.
