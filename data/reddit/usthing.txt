Upwards of 50% of all traded bitcoin is still in mt.gox somewhere. This is just what happens when 50%+ of the people who were buying bitcoin have no way to buy or sell anymore.
EVEN DESPITE the total lack of ability for those inside to do anything with their bitcoin, mt.gox still accounts for a substantial fraction of daily trades. This is a worrying fact.
This is a lot worse than people have lead on.

I didn't know emails cost $600/each and are now missing and presumed worthless to those who owned them. I didn't know people actually had their life savings in emails. I didn't know that companies stored their incomes and liquidity source in emails either. 
This is a terrible comparison, and a complete fallacy. A strawman at best.
A more apt comparison would be saying 'mtgox = Money holding Service, Bitcoin = money holding protocol (currency).
If a bank holding 6%+ of the total currency supply closed without making the depositor's whole, would the banking and currency systems collapse? Well this really depends. It would certainly make a whole lot of people very angry and unlikely to work with those systems again. It would scare people at other banks into getting their money out asap. It would mess with a lot of people's lives. The market for that currency would go crazy, especially if a majority of that currency was in hard deposit and not offered to the market before being stolen, then suddenly becoming available whenever the criminals decided to use it. What about companies that had used that bank as a source of funds or the storage of incomes? Those companies would also go insolvent and have issues, causing the overall market tied to that system to get royally screwed. Honestly, with this kind of major failure within such an illiquid system, you are pretty much at the whims of the people involved in the system, so it's a flip of the coin.
If the collapse of a single major exchange were to cause mistrust in other exchanges, thus causing people to start a run on those remaining exchanges, which would cause those exchanges to no longer be able to trade or operate, which would remove 90% of the liquidity of an already illiquid currency... then yes.. you'd have major damage to the bitcoin market and probably destroy it.
If the collapse of a single major exchange caused mistrust of the currency in general by members of the external population who might have been contemplating investment or participation, thus narrowing further the pool of potential buyers and severely capping adoption and price increases in the future... again, you'd probably destroy bitcoin as well.
Bitcoin requires two major things in order to continue to grow:
1) New suckers... I mean adopters to continually increase demand at an exponential rate.
2) Trust amongst those adopters that the other adopters won't dump their holdings and crash the market, or steal their holdings in some relatively easy way.

Transactionally, not physically.
Just because the bank stopped (slowed) transacting doesn't mean the vault's empty.

Oh, okay wait... so you are saying I can walk into your house, I can take all your money, kill your family, rape your mother or children then shoot you in the face or disable you for life, because who cares about arbitrary rules set forth by our masters? You must have amazing house parties.
I mean morally, people might be pissed at me for doing all that, but they would have no real recourse to do anything about it other than say "I don't think that was a nice thing you just did to helvatian!". If they want to stop me, they sure could if they are bigger or stronger than me and my friends, but other than arranging an angry mob in response to my horrible assault to you and your family, they probably won't care because it didn't happen to them.  Can I get you to sign a document saying you agree to all this? I'd want to give the police something to laugh about when I walk out your door afterwards.
I mean, you want freedom from our master right?  So you'd technically love how I am expressing my freedom in the face of evil oppressors then, right? 
Law is how we take morality and apply it fairly to all. The code of Hammurabi is the earliest existing documentation of the effect of converting morality into LAW. Specifically, Mr. Hammurabi was considered a great leader of the people, and his moral greatness was used as a compass for others to follow in order to maximize PEACE and SAFETY of his people and society as a whole. You see, people are individually unable to apply morality correctly in the face of disputes. Everyone claims they are on the moral high ground. Mr. Hammurabi, being separate from all other people in his land, became an "impartial judge" because we can assume he never had most of the problems that common people have, and thus he had the ability to set those laws without subjective desire, and instead used pure facts without exceptions. Whether or not everyone agreed to his moral standing was not the point, as his laws were fair and just (You are not guilty of anything unless you do something that was not legal). As far as civilized humanity is concerned, law and morality are hand in hand, and law has been established as the apex of fairness in democratic society. Whether or not a society is truly democratic, and thus has truly fair laws is another story, but you cannot claim an objective morality while also declaring law to be arbitrary, as that is a contradiction.

I'd suspect that there is a lot more bitcoin in gox than people have lead on, which may flood the "active" market with a lot of supply if they open withdrawals again. If they vanish, market price should stay the same as it is now since mt.gox has not really impacted other exchanges as much (or at all) due to the extremely low amount of volume coming out of mt.gox. So.. prices will go down or stay neutral... at best.

The premium mtgox had was due to it being the only game in town for approx 50% of the bitcoin market. Only recently did the market share of mtgox dip below 50% (at least in USD), and for some time it was literally &gt;80% of all market transactions. Generally speaking, mtgox DOMINATED the overall transactional market in all currencies. It's downfall is a significant event worldwide.
2011 chart:
2013 chart for comparison:
And due to the size of mtgox, I'd expect the majority of people who are active in bitcoin priced the value of their bitcoins according to the quoted price by mtgox. This will soon not be the case, but it's still going to pressure prices until market share successfully transfers to another competitor(s), who will be modifying the price of bitcoin to attract transactions or deposits in however way they choose.

So... literally everything that happens is good for bitcoin always according to Glad you guys are so diligent to post the stuff that would fluff prices for no reason.
Realistically, the ETF would have almost zero effect on the actual prices for bitcoin. First of all, the Winkledorks already own a lot of bitcoins, so this ETF has been considered by some as a way for them to cash out without having to cash out. 
Secondly, if they already own bitcoin, than their ETF wouldn't need to go out to market to buy new bitcoin, thus not effecting the market at all.
Another point of note is that we don't know what the ETF will be comprised of entirely. There could be any mix of cash, bitcoin, btc related stocks (such as bitinstant or bitpay, etc). The ETF is to offer shares (UIT'S) of the subject ETF (General bitcoin) in exchange for cash or OTHER BITCOINS (Called a creation unit) from people who want to own bitcoin without being afraid of losing their keys. Instead, they own shares of the ETF. The Winklespawn won't just straight out buy the fund's NAV in bitcoin the first day (In fact, I bet they've already got enough to start their etf for a few months), as that would be very stupid. This process may take months and if done correctly, will not effect the market in any way. 
"But but, bitcoin goes to moon!" is what you will say. Not at all, in fact, since the point of the ETF is to be a storage and trading zone for bitcoin OUTSIDE of the normal trading market, the majority of the ETF's transactions will not be market purchasing of bitcoin inventory.
Sorry speculators.
GLD was brought into existence to meet the ever growing demand for gold after the market crash in the early 2000's and the fed's monetary easing that lead to our housing bubble. The fact that GLD went up with GOLD is because GLD IS SUPPOSED TO GO UP WITH GOLD. ITS AN INDEX ETF, THAT'S THE POINT.
Any idiot can say "Derr GLD is why gold is so expensive now" when any financial analyst will go "GLD is worth whatever gold is at the time, depending on combination of basket and non basket assets in the ETF portfolio".
In case anyone is wondering. GOLD has been one of the most traded products on the planet for centuries, and the ETF did not change this. The only thing that the ETF has done is made carrying costs less for people buying gold in normal ways. Firms that needed to have gold holdings saved a few % of transaction fees. That's it.

Mt.Gox is actually the largest in terms of potential total bitcoin holdings by its members. Transactionally, it has faulted as of late (from 90% of all daily transactions to around 30%?), but it was THE titan of bitcoin movement for the majority of bitcoin's existence. 
People forget that the majority of bitcoin transactions were PURCHASES, and once purchased, the majority of those coins probably stayed in wallets such as mt.gox. While I am too lazy to check the amounts, I am willing to wager that a sizeable portion of all online bitcoins are located in gox still.

Pyramid 101:
Satoshi was the first head. I don't care enough about your people to track the levels beyond that, but if I recall, most of the currently active heads of the pyramid run a scam called "bitcoin.org" or something. Look into it.
Bitcoin's system isn't working, you utter moron. Miners aren't making any money, the price is falling like crazy, as people stop mining, the transaction processing ability declines. As more "merchants" latch on to bitcoin while the consumer base stagnates, the price of bitcoin is further pushed down since there are more sellers than buyers. Bitcoins cost approx $40/transaction last I checked. When there are no new buyers in the market, that transaction cost will eventually eat into the "price" of bitcoin. You are at the mercy of new buyers, you are also at the mercy of miners who process the transactions. Without either of these, bitcoin fails and you will never get a transaction to work if either of those people fail to accept the current terms. And I am not even going to break into the discussion about exchange manipulation and hackers. Hell, what about the 51% attack potential? I remember everyone PLEADING with some mining company to spread its power around instead of allocating 51% of the hashing power in the hands of 1 group! Not free. Nothing is free.
You should consider yourself a clueless consumer buying a fad product with zero value over other payment methods. Essentially, you are a hipster, intentionally using an overpriced and less efficient product in order to "spurn" the normals. You are a tool.

No one really knows, but simple logic would say that since mt.gox was in control of roughly 80% of all transactions a year ago, and was at around 50% when issues started top pop up... and transactions are tied to stored bitcoin...  then I'd guess roughly 40% of all actively traded bitcoins (before the issues) traded are stuck in gox. No idea how many inactive (not traded often or at all) bitcoins are being held.
Remember, I said ACTIVE, not TOTAL. Since the market prices are only based on actively traded coin supply/demand, there is a lot of potential problems that could arise.

Experience ALWAYS trumps intelligence, and I can pretty much guarantee that even the smartest AP/Gifted kid in your class will be completely wrong about bitcoin at least once. And it only takes one mistake to blow you away.
Do you want to know how the 2000's real estate bubble happened? Banks saw a growing sector of the market that was very profitable and hired PHD math students and rocket scientists with ZERO experience in real estate or finance to build complex modeling and securitization software based on theoretical real estate performance projections and valuation principals based on manipulating "historical data" in order to standardize/mass produce the profitable aspects of that new business (CMBS and their Derivatives). Over the course of 8 years, most of the top performing analysts and executives were promoted into decision making positions based on the returns they generated from correctly using these models. All bank-related policies became infected by these studious but naive people in order to increase profitability of their models and securitization processes.
Consumers followed the "smart" guys with the impressive models and impressive returns. 
Then one day the models stopped working as planned. In fact, many of those models stopped working COMPLETELY. Those decision makers, who only remembered when the model worked and based their entire career on these models, suddenly had nothing to steer the ship with and ended up crashing. Following other models, they fired employees or dumped certain securities in fire sales, causing panic on the market, further screwing up their established models and reinforcing a downward spiral. Don't worry, a lot of those INTELLIGENT people are now in charge of running trillions of dollars in hedge funds using complex algorithms that predict stock performance based on complex modeling software based on theoretical stock performance projections and valuation principals using "historical and current data". Nothing could possibly go wrong.
Meanwhile, properly structured and EXPERIENCED banks/investors saw that something bad was coming, and planned accordingly. They paid the right people, made the right contacts, sold or bought the right securities using their instincts, and made out of the crash like bandits. Plenty of "old" experienced people made a KILLING in the crash. Most of the intelligent people went home jobless. Remember, for every $1 lost by someone, another guy probably made $1.

There is a $4 buy/sell fee on each side of bitcoin due to the market spread. So if you take into account the .25% fee, plus the $4 per bitcoin to buy, plus whatever the conversion fee is from BTC/INR in terms of bid-ask spread. Also throw in the daily volatility of bitcoin prices, and you could end up paying way more than 4% of the total transaction. Also you have to hope there is someone locally available to buy/deposit that money once it's been transferred without getting scammed.

Read my edited post. I covered all this. Also, since the price was artificially inflated at gox, it's really hard to claim a lot of the prices that many people have quoted. If anything, gox inflated bitcoin values for the last few months/year during the time that these issues were not widely known.

Well obviously if no one is using bitcoin, that means there are less available on the market, driving the intrinsic value through the roof! I expect that bitcoin will have less than 1 transaction worth of volume per year, making bitcoins worth exactly $3,000,000 each. Then the fed will crash as bitcoin becomes more valuable then the entire world economy.

No. That's money that miners make. 630x 25 coins per block divided by 350 transactions per block. Mining isnt static, as electricity, manpower and miner costs are always changing. Miners don't mine for free, they mine for profit. Miner costs are paid after the miner sells those coins to cover it expenses, which they do by putting the coins on the market. 
I already explained the other parts that you apparently missed the point on (shocking).
Did you not read my post at all?
@_date: 2014-07-06 11:20:11


The first law of bitcoin is that the number of mined bitcoins per block will decrease over time. The second law of bitcoin is that mining will ALWAYS take 2 weeks to mine 2016 blocks and will constantly reset its artificial difficulty to match that expectation. While bitcoin doesn't necessairly have a mandated price, it creates an environment that forces a certain price point to be made in order for the system to function, and further forces the price of bitcoins to rise per bitcoin so long as expenses to mine the bitcoins stay the same or rise with inflation or computing requirements.
Bitcoin, by its own internal law, has created a pseudo-fiat currency that is automatically manipulated to always increase in price so long as nothing else changes. I.E $600 to mine a block of bitcoin today = $24, but if you halve the reward automatically, the price automatically HAS to go to $48 in order for a miner to want to mine and break even. Also, the bitcoin foundation has specifically modified and placed artificial rules on bitcoin in order to further manipulate the price they deemed appropriate, aka limiting transactions in order to prevent the blockchain from increasing in size too much to be theoretically possible to mine (due to the storage requirements), which would kill bitcoin.
The central banks WISH they had that kind of manipulative control over their currency.

That's the point of fiat. It decreases in value per unit as unit amounts increase to account for economic (population and technical efficiency growth). Bitcoin is the same issue but in the opposite direction. It's just as flawed.

No, this is a bad thing. This raises suspicion on the potential for other "founders/leaders" to also be doing illicit activities. I have no doubt that this is only the beginning of a crackdown spree since the majority of early btc transactions were indeed illicit, and most of the people that became "bit millionaires" got rich from either directly or indirectly aiding such illegal activities when it was the only game in town.
You dig deep enough and everyone has some dirt on them, but most aren't at the forefront of a disruptive technology that many believe to be a scam and/or against sovereign interests. Nothing pretty is coming out of bitcoin anytime soon, that's for sure.

What part of a crowd of people with signs "SUPPORTING" a person at a podium who appears to be making a speech while teetering over a cliff doesn't say "voting" to you? This cartoon is basically saying "Everyone is voting for this person/thing/idea" and keeping it from falling over the cliff despite being in a dangerous position. The bitcoin person, obviously lacking any empathy or possibly seeing a butterfly, decides to step off and choose not to continue to "vote/support" whatever this person represents. 
Bitcoin man can represent the currency, and those other sign waving people could be world currencies, and the podium man could be the united states/global economy.
The Bitcoin man can represent the bitcoin community, and the people who are carrying signs represent those keeping the petrodollar afloat.
The bitcoin man can represent a subset of americans, and the man over the ledge could be a perceived archaic government system which is teetering over oblivion.
The bitcoin man can represent the bitcoin community, and the people could be those who believe drugs should remain illegal, with the man over the edge representing the war on drugs.
All of these representations revolve around "Voting" for something that is obviously dangerously close to ruin and being supported by people/institutions/ideas/currencies/etc that are unable to see the other choices.
While this cartoon is laughably condescending and ignorant, its not exactly "Deep".

So what. Everyone keeps clamouring about this "deflationary" currency, when it's actually one of the most inflationary on the planet with regards to creating new units of "currency". Just because those individual units are being sold at high prices to economically unintelligent people doesn't suddenly make the currency better than USD despite being 10x more print-happy than the USD is. 
If your theory was the case, all  the US would have to do is declare USD to now be worth whatever $500 was the day before, and it would completely destroy bitcoin in both price and stability.

Selling "salvation" of any kind, be it for devotion and donations, or via financial investment, can be just as bad. The fact that you think otherwise shows how deep you are into this fanaticism with some false savior. Actually, I'd consider it worse, because false gods save people from an existential threat that cannot be disproven (Dread about what happens when I die). I understand why people choose to have faith in a religion when faced with a certain death, but spreading the "word of bitcoin" can actually end up hurting people's lives on a "real" level. People can end up losing their life's savings for this. That can happen tomorrow, not when they eventually kick the bucket.

Did you, or did you not, just pay 26% more money (in USD equivalent) to get someone to take bitcoin for something he wanted in cash?
If yes, you are losing money vs using cash. If you are losing money vs using cash, why use bitcoin in the first place?
If the answer to that is: "Because bitcoin is better"
Then why do you need to pay a premium to get someone to use it? Generally, paying someone extra of something in exchange for an item means that the thing being used to pay is not as good compared to other payment alternatives.
Either way, you just showed how bitcoin is less attractive or just worse than USD.

Industrial demand has been, and will always be the primary demand driver in the world economy. Speculative demand is what enables businesses to form and economies to grow.

@_date: 2014-02-08 10:15:21
Larger corporations make it harder for a single person to be found liable unless they are REALLY dumb or open about it. It's just a larger, more complex organization with more complex systems than smaller companies. It's like trying to blame the owner of a nation wide cleaning company if you find a speck of dirt somewhere in a random manhattan apartment serviced by that company.
Of course it will be harder to prove liability for a company with 10,000 employees in a single office. If that small company owner had the same size and complexity, he'd have the same level of "protection", and it's not to due with anything political. In fact, most DA's would have a field day if they could pin something on such a massive company, but because of how enormously difficult it is to even catch small fry perpetrators, it's likely impossible to actually find anything even if they try.

“I was anticipating a lot of the other bidders getting disqualified because it seemed to me that the Marshals Service didn’t want syndicates bidding,” Mr. Waters said, referring to the agency’s intense screening process. “It was sort of just a fun thing. I took a gamble.”
"The increase in price could also have been a red herring, said Steven Englander, a research analyst with Citigroup. “People who bid and who are successful in their bidding obviously would like the market to think that the price was high rather than low,” he said."
Seems to me that the real bidders were doing in the $400 range while the "syndicates" were offering way higher to counter the fact that they were getting disqualified for being syndicates.
How to profit from stupidity:
1) Form a buying syndicate despite marshals screening against such groups. 
2) Have you and your friends get properly qualified INDIVIDUALLY and submit sub-$500 bids
3) At the same time, submit puff bids via syndicate for $700+
4)Even if you don't win, go ahead and say you bid over $800 because you probably had bitcoins in your wallet already, so might as well inflate the price a bit to sell into it, knowing that the real price of bitcoin is actually $450 now.
5) Profit
Sell coins into the designed ramp up.

Interesting. So your assumption is that people are suddenly going to take a complete turn and shed all of their natural self serving habits (the same habits that have been well documented and observed for as long as we have had written words) for bitcoin. 
You seem to be expecting that rich (aka 1%ers, or "not me") or advantaged people (also "not me") are going to suddenly go "hey, you know what? I'm going to stop doing what has made me rich and successful, and sacrifice all that wealth and energy for bitcoin in hopes that other bitcoin people (AKA "You", who is too lazy or unsuccessful) can prosper on my efforts and thus take my spot at the top." 
First of all, this is the most anti-libertarian thing I have ever heard. You are replacing the efforts of a government with the efforts of an individual (they become the same thing at this point) and that individual loses his economic freedom for the sake of other's (your) economic freedom. 
Second, you are interfering with "the free market", which makes you as bad as the big banks and the fed. Your implication is that Bitcoin can bail people out at the expense of others, but banks can't?
Third, your premise and assumptions are 100% flawed. The expectation of altruism is the first sign of a flawed theory. 
How about this: If you love bitcoin so much, and you want it to succeed so much, why don't you do the work that you expect others to do for you.
Go to some small, highly tech savvy yet unstable county, provide the education and resources (At your own expense) and then subsidize the entire GDP of that small country (better have a few billion worth of currency/bitcoin read) until they become bitcoin dependant, and enjoy all the profits you'll make when bitcoin hits $100,000 (assuming you have any money left).

What is it exactly that governments do? Hold order? Maintain a reasonable level of warfare (vs total war)? Manage injustice? What are you talking about? 90% of the history of humanity was under no government (the most decentralized form of government is individual government), and we just slaughtered and massacred each other while living in twig hutts and eating uncooked meat.
A decentralized government wouldn't work because people need to be coerced into maintaining a symbiotic society. Without someone to enforce those laws when someone attempts to break them, the laws become meaningless and people will stop acting accordingly. 
You said it in your own words "the attempt to control humans is an attempt to control nature" and nature dictates that mankind is violent, uncompromising and self serving, as with all other living creatures. Government is just attempting to manage nature as much as it can given the limited ability to control. 
Side note: If government didn't exist, neither would bitcoin or probably you. You'd probably have been killed, or at least one of your ancestors would have been. Don't be so quick to hate the thing that's allowed you to exist.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:49:11
What are you referring to with the "doesn't support 90% of the value"? 
An asset is worth 100% of whatever its useful (economic) value is. Beyond that, speculation, specialization or market mispricing due to external factors (such as a mania, economic collapse or sudden technological advancement) causes the market price to fluctuate around that economic value. I have never seen a useful asset or commodity ever drop 90% compared to it's fair economic value. For example, oil is primarily priced due to the supply and demand of energy requirements worldwide, and if a country had a sudden energy issue and needed a ton of oil, the price of oil would increase to reflect that country's new demand for increased oil. However, no one would buy oil if they thought the price was higher than the economic value of the oil when used. This is why oil isn't $10,000,000 a barrel despite it's finite supply and essential uses in the world economy.
The price of a house in the early 2000's skyrocketed due to a mania brought about by low interest rates, government policies and global demand. During the mania, the economic value of a house remained relatively stable, but market prices spiked well beyond that value. The collapse in house prices was simply a correction that brought the market value back closer to the economic value.

Boxcars can transport goods, and they are only valued based on their ability to provide that service within that industry. Outside of the transportation service, boxcars have far less value(scrap). Bit coin does not offer that kind of practical benefit, and it doesn't even have a base(scrap) value.

I know this is difficult to understand, but when 2 different things are not entirely the same, but share similar overarching similarities, it doesn't matter that they are not the same in every way. 
How do I explain this outlandish concept...
A biological virus in the real world is a organism that infects a host body and causes damage.
A computer virus in the electronic world is a program that infects a host system and causes damage.
With your logic, they are 100% not similar because one is via the internet, the other is biological. While yes, they are not the same exact thing, they represent essentially the same abstract process in different mediums, with similar results and features (infection, damage, spreading, some survival goal, pain, suffering, death, mayhem).
Just because it's not 100% spelled out for you doesn't mean it's not even comparable. I believe the term is called *abstraction*. If I rob you once, then find a way to hack your computer and rob you another way, I am not a different person doing a different thing. I am still me, and I am still robbing you, but just because I use a different, more complicated process the second time around doesn't mean that these events are not at all comparable.
Edit: Back to the topic at hand. At the end of the day, the tulip bulb bubble was created by a number of uninformed people with an uniformed understanding of world and the value of a specific product/item for whatever reason. I can be so bold as to say that bitcoin is also an aesthetic appeal, and that appeal being that you are a member of a supposedly intelligent, rebellious anti government, anti currency group. 
It is this well documented fundamental inability to understand these basic concepts that plagues bitcoin, and the majority of the people who believe in bitcoin (or if you are cynical, the people who fell for the marketing guys who are pawning these things off on people for free money). This is understandable. After all, religion still exists due to the same weakness inherent in a vast subsection of the world population.

People invest in property to pay less than renting, and to "own" their place of living. It's a form of security. People own gold because they understand that it's been used a store of wealth for the entirety of modern civilization, and the assumption is that this notion will not change in their lifetimes (and it hasn't). People invest in stocks because they believe a company that already has value and profit, will increase its value and profit. It's a less risky form of business ownership in it's basic levels. 
House flipping was a speculative event similar to a pyramid scheme, but this was tied to individual physical assets, so it's technically just a bubble. A bubble is a surge in the price of a certain asset class due to perceived increase in value with no guaranteed return. A pyramid scheme offers nothing of real value in itself and is backed by nothing but an idea that requires more people to constantly pay for access to that idea in order to make a "guaranteed" reward. Pay me X, go find 10 people to pay you X, you get 9X.
A program that enables someone to potentially get a playstation once that person has referred 100 others or whatever is a pyramid scheme. The idea is that you can get a cheap playstation for $10 if you can find 100 more people to pay $10 as well. The $10 you give provides you ZERO security or guarantee of reward because you still have to get 100 more people to pay as well.

Saving something that could be worth literally NOTHING at any random time?
At least a house can keep you dry during a rainstorm. If bitcoin lost 1/2 its value tomorrow, where will you be? You might as well have spent all that money on hookers and blow because you would lose that purchasing power anyways. Imagine "saving" all your bitcoin at $1,000. Or worse, some jackass hacks you. How would you feel today? 
A) Smart 
B) Financially savvy
C) A total scmhuck that lost as much as 70% of his savings because he thought bitcoin was a way to safely store wealth, and now has to "ride it back up" and pray that it gets back to $1,000 in order to break even after literally doing nothing with that money for 6+ months.
It's not a deflationary system, it's a stupid system.  If you have the strength of will to use a savings mindset with ANY REAL investment, and not a speculative and overpriced gamble of a piece of crap as bitcoin, you will be much better off in life.
Wealthy people have been investing their surplus resources into productive assets ever since the dawn of bartering. It's a simple premise, don't be a jackass. Don't hold your entire savings in any currency unless you will need it within the next few months. Never put all your money into one investment. Never "invest" in unproductive assets (a boat if you aren't a fisherman, a $50,000 car that eats more fuel than an Iraqi invasion, a 5 bedroom house when only 2 people live with you, a Stairmaster when you aren't overweight, a margarita maker when you aren't a bar).
Here's a test of a productive asset:
You buy something today that you can sell next year for around the same price, but has also made you a percentage of that money invested in some kind of revenue during that year. 
Here's a quick list of "productive" assets:
Dividend stocks, bonds, investment properties, businesses, distressed assets, fixed financial instruments that sell at a discount to market value, annuities, microloans, cattle, workable farm land, any commodities used by the above investments that will be converted into a good that can be sold at a profit. 
Here's a quick list of junk that will always lose money unless you are reselling it to some sucker for a profit or using it to be productive (make money):
Restaurant food, bitcoins, drugs, expensive cars, jewelry, consumer electronics, weapons, penny stocks, speculative stocks, credit cards, vacation homes, jetskis or boats, cable tv, movie tickets, alcohol, hotel rooms, vacations, time-shares, lawn mower, any pre-made food that you didn't cook, gasoline, traveling, video games, gambling, lottery tickets, concert tickets, porn, poorly managed businesses, cell phones, anything made by Apple, gym memberships, herbalife packages, ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, sporting goods, accessories, insurance, education, art, books, gold, silver, flatscreens, paper, religion, sex, family.
The idea is to have more productive assets than non-productive assets (aside from necessitites). It's really not that hard.

So it's not a good store of value since its volatile and relatively easy to lose, and bitcoin is already the 3rd party in itself since you have to buy and sell those bitcoin in order to go online and transact the purchase of stocks and securities with those bitcoin, so for larger institutions, you have to pay people to do this, which will turn into hidden costs outside of a pure transaction.
That isn't the case yet, or potentially ever. Mining isn't feasible for most people as energy costs outweigh the return of mining for anyone without massive technical skills and access to proper hardware. How do you counter the abilities of a lucky few to basically control the whole market?
The average user will not have backups, and even the best people on the planet cannot counter every random happenstance. Even with paper wallets, how do you prove that the wallet has any coins without a way to confirm via the internet? Unlike fiat, which has a definite known value at any time based on the item itself. So bitcoin isn't a savior in the case of oppression or strife, as you end up with the same result of any other currency... so again, mr. winklevoss, why use bitcoin?

So if the bitcoin network were to fail or collapse, a bitcoin would still have intrinsic value? You seem to misunderstand "intrinsic" value and are thinking of "extrinsic" value. Intrinsic value means the thing itself has a value without the need of external support. Extrinsic value is an object with negligible intrinsic value, but made valuable because of external support around it.
Bitcoin, like fiat, is entirely based on the trust and services of a network of people who support it. It has ZERO intrinsic value, as it has no utility in any other way than as a coin, much like a dollar is practically useless for anything but being a dollar. Decentralized is more than just bitcoin's support structure, but also it's value structure. 
Now, the only difference between a bitcoin and a fiat piece of paper, is that the piece of paper theoretically backed by the faith and assets of the issuing country, while bitcoin has no faith or backing by anything. No one will come to save bitcoin if and when it falls in price, and anyone who invests in it has ZERO protection from any externally disruptive events. So unlike the USD, bitcoin is structured and acts entirely like a pyramid scheme.

Actually, 6%. This is 6% of the whole supply, the total current possible coins, not currently accessible coins (total - natural losses).

@_date: 2014-09-28 23:38:21
Decentralized means that anyone who owns bitcoin is also a promoter. Pyramid 101. The second you buy a coin (from another promoter who obviously doesn't believe in bitcoin enough to hold it himself any longer), you are at the mercy of market trends and have no other incentive but to hype and hope since you just bought at the top of the current market. The entire current price of the bitcoin IS YOUR DOWNSIDE. You are REQUIRED to hype in order to potentially increase the retail value, and you hope that you can eventually pawn this junk on next idiot who is more afraid, desperate or stupid than you.
Its a typical herbalife-style scam where you actually have to own the product and take the holding risk and recruit others into the "program" in order to make any money. Meanwhile, the people who sold to you that product take all the profits and laugh at you.
Unlike herbalife, however, you are buying AT RETAIL PRICES and hoping that retail prices will surge while you own it. There is no business plan here. There is no point. At least herbalife offers you "wholesale" prices if you join them. What kind of obtuse person buys something for RETAIL price and expects to make any kind of profit? That's the bitcoin system in a nutshell. Buying a bitcoin to "hold" is pretty much the dumbest thing anyone can do on the planet.
Bitcoin will never be free from control. There is and always will be someone pulling strings to your disadvantage. Whether it's the government, large bitcoin owners, hackers, 3rd party news, internet regulations, financial regulations, companies that refuse to support usage. The greatest ignorance is believing that anything that has a market is incapable of manipulation from someone that ISN'T YOU.

If bitcoin(the system) is the product, then bitcoins themselves are even less valuable or relevant in regards to investment since they are just a derivative of product that generates no income by design. 
It would be akin to investing in physical empty credit cards(imagine a blank card with no credit on it) because of the long term potential of credit. Last I checked, the transaction item itself (credit card) has zero value in itself, but the credit, and credit card company attached to the card have value. If visa tried to sell me a blank credit card on the assumption that people will suddenly start collecting them as a form of wealth storage vehicle, I'd laugh at them!

If you think this is a flaw in the system you don't know anything about why the system was established and became what it is today. 
The "popular" vote was never supposed to have total control of the government. In fact, this is just proof that the system is capable of preventing the "majority" from having absolute power over the minority. Gerrymandering is a 2 way street, and all parties fight to gain an advantage. The fact that, despite the utter hatred of republicans by the majority of people, they are still able to have some form of representation in the government is an astounding thing. The tyranny of the majority needs to be fought off as much as the tyranny of the minority.
IF anything, I wish the electoral college was a better check against the desires of the majority. It is their job to do so.
The very fact that the congress and senate are so unpopular given the current surge in progressive thinking in america is an outstanding result of a properly made system of checks and balances.
If this was such a run-away issue, how did Obama get elected? I thought the republicans have utter control? Apparently voters still matter.
The major problem is that people are too stupid to see past party lines on matters. Imagine if the people in the Gerrymandered district actually grew a fucking brain and decided to vote based on something OTHER than "anyone in X party is better because its X party and not Y party", then your gerrymandered district just backfired. This can happen anywhere in the united states, and 10 years is more than enough time for opinions to change.

Apparently, 53% of the people they sampled were already bitcoin people, or at least CLAIMED to be (We do not know how many just lied). Boy, I wonder which way the results are skewed... 
Out of the total sample, roughly 66% of the people favored and or considered buying bitcoins. 
Removing the obviously partial responders means that roughly 13% of potentially non-partial respondents might buy bitcoin for the first time, or at least thought about buying bitcoins in the future. This is further explained in another bubble by saying "87% of the people who did not already own bitcoins said they were unsure or would buy (very loaded phrasing, btw)."
Real questions regarding this poll:
1. How many of the respondents lied knowing that it would skew opinion in the direction they want.
2. Would people who don't even know what bitcoin is even take the time to answer this survey?  Most "civilians" straight up don't care enough to be bothered.
3. Where did they get their samples from? If 53% of respondents are already bitcoin owners, this shows that there is obviously a bias towards who they are giving these surveys to. 
4. How did they collect these surveys?

Good point. Bitcoins are actually "printing" more than the banks are.
In the past year and a half, the amount of total bitcoins mined went for 8.5m to 12.7m, thats a 49.4% Increase in the "money supply".
In relation, the fed has *maybe* "printed" 5-10% more money since 2008. 
So technically, bitcoin is worse than the fed at it's game, especially considering the volatile price fluctuation of bitcoins, which makes it even WORSE economically. At least the fed can maintain the inflation rate. Bitcoin is approaching the same concept like a headless chicken!

He isn't backing bitcoin itself, he's backing coinbase and the idea of bitcoin-like technologies. The future may have bitcoins at $10 for all he cares, he's invested in a payment processor that wouldn't care either way.
As I said, he's backing an item he bought (coinbase) and you are damned right he's going to market it whether he likes it or not because that's the only thing that has "trendiness" right now. And in investor speak, "trendiness" equals oversized valuations at resale.

Not even close. I could see you comparing a cat and a dog despite their obvious differences since they are both considered pets and petable and essentially the same "type" of thing. 
A comparison between a cat and asteroid, beyond the "we are all stardust" thing, isn't even close. They neither share characteristics, nor features, that would allow the two to be abstractly associated on any level with any objective observer (I am sure, some guy acts like his cat is a destructive evil force like a meteor/asteroid, but that's only to him). 
One of these things is not like the other:
1. Cat
2. Dog

How do I explain to a potential client that it wont take 10 minutes to confirm a transaction? I can't because this can and does happen. Also: 
Why is coinbase better than mtgox in security? "Well because we aren't out of business yet and as far as the public knows, all our coins are secured".

Incorrect. 
Bitcoin has no use value in itself. It has zero power unless used as a medium of exchange on the bitcoin network, much like a arcade coin only has value when used in exchange for video games within the arcade. You could have a $million in arcade coins, but if that arcade ceases to operate, those coins become 100% worthless. 
The payment network of bitcoin is decentralized, and as such, has no centralized value to be recognized. So you cannot claim the value in bitcoin is in it's network either, as no one has claim on that network, or any portion of it. Much like every puramid scheme known to man, it inherits an extrinsic value via the people who decide to adopt bitcoin voluntarily under the false assumption that it already has value and usefulness. People like you, who have been sold the BS that bitcoin has intrinsic value, are some of those foolish pyramid participants that don't (or worse, DO) understand the basis of the bitcoin value structure. You are usually one of the people left holding the proverbial bag when the "early adopters" have got off the pot with a substantial portion of your offered services/fiat.
The bitcoin payment network only exists because people use bitcoin, and bitcoin only has value because people use the network. It is 100% beholden to increasing numbers of people adopting it in order to sustain the prices that are paid to adopt. Someone who paid $1000 for a bitcoin wants it to reach $1,200 and will do all he can to get someone else to adopt in order to increase that price. Since bitcoin's only stable attribute is it's incredibly limited supply, the entire purpose of bringing in new adopters is to inflate the demand and thus the price. The entire point of mining is that as more people become miners, it becomes harder to mine, again reinforcing the "last one in loses" analogy that is so common amongst pyramid schemes in order to reinforce the price increases. A miner coming into the market today with a standard asic rig would retain almost ZERO profitability unless he were able to convince new adopters to demand more bitcoin in order to make his project viable. This is the basis of every pyramid scheme ever made.

My first questions as a regulator:
1. What use are bitcoins at all other than as a cheap form of transaction service (which could be implemented by pretty much any fiat using transaction service since its open source technology)?
2. How does bitcoin work without using a fiat currency to either buy or sell the bitcoin?
3. What happens if your hard drive dies or there is a massive power outage, such as in the case of a natural disaster or war?
Watch the hilarious attempt to make bitcoin sound useful taking these questions into account.

Global non-cash payments worldwide(2012): 333 billion
CO2 Cost per transaction: .00116 tons
Global bitcoin transaction amount past year: 21,747,368
CO2 Cost Per transaction: .0345 tons
Bitcoin is currently consumes 30x more CO2 per transaction.
Current Bitcoin max transaction volume (7 transactions/second): 110,376,000
CO2 cost per transaction: .0068 tons
Multiple: 5.9x current banking system
Visa theoretical maximum transaction volume: 126,144,000,000
CO2 cost per transaction: .003 tons
50% more efficient than the current max bitcoin potential.
This also doesn't assume banks do anything but non-cash transactions or other services, which is untrue. I also can't seem to find the source for the 750,000 tons CO2 estimate for bitcoin.
Are they also ignoring the CO2 consumptions of users who take bitcoin vs real transactions and the cost of storage and office space for bitcoin companies (since all bitcoin companies act as "banks" since they are all transacting "currency" of bitcoin.

And that is different form bitcoin, how? If people, which are less rational and stable than governments, decide to tank bitcoin value, you lose the value of whatever bitcoin you have. The same results occur in either assumption. There is literally ZERO benefit of bitcoin compared to fiat in this sense. The only difference is that bitcoin has no personal liability attachment to those who help manage and control the system, so if and when they decide to tank that system, they have almost zero consequences to worry about. A ruling party or despot does not have this power, and if the people decided to rebel against such authority, those deposed people would have a hard time hiding from justice. Some, or many neckbeards (who no one has voted for or even heard of) have almost zero culpability if he were to crash the whole market tomorrow, and that is a really scary proposition. Imagine if these people were capable of both crashing the market and making far more money in a few years than they would have by running for an office or working a real job, and all they had to do was sell this quasi currency at the top for 100% profit.

Marketing my friend. The best way to sell a bitcoin is to sell the idea that the government will have no power over you, and the freedom/better life you would have because of buying/using bitcoin; these ideas/scenarios sold to new people by someone who was selling them bitcoin before them, back in time and down the rabbit hole to the original bitcoin users who had to bring some value to the worthless bits they had in their computers. With every successive wave of marketing, btc reaches higher values, and those at the top of the pyramid sell out causing the crashes that happen from time to time. If anything, bitcoin should be a textbook example of multilevel marketing success stories.

The don't just want to be rich, they want to be rich quickly. The best way to do that is to cultivate frenzied buying attitudes in the minds of other people, including other community members and outsiders. This is internet marketing 101, akin to those sales sites hyping the natural benefits of goji berries or acai juices. Multi-level marketing requires these mindsets in order to sustain the ever increasing prices that support the MLM system. Those who are indoctrinated last are the least likely to prosper at the current price level, and are naturally incentivized to further raise prices. Someone is indoctrinated to purchase the product, and now it's that person's job to indoctrinate others in order to prosper. Nothing good can come from such a system.

Decentralization is the biggest strength and weakness of bitcoin. Since there is no central authority or systems in place to keep the currency in demand, it is beholden to the whims of popular opinion and fad mentality. There is a reason that apple has to keep remaking the iphone on a yearly basis. It's a luxury item, not a necessity. As such, it needs to constantly be renewed to give consumers a reason to use it. Fiat is a necessity. I walk down any street in my country, and the fiat of that country is the required currency.
Last time I checked, practically every bitcoin related good or service can also be purchased in fiat. Also, there are no goods or services offered by bitcoin that I cannot find a replacement of in fiat. The lack of meaningful exclusivity is a major problem with any system.
The last time there was a service only used in conjunction with bitcoin, it was closed because it was a DRUG BAZAAR and illegal. Even still, I can go to practically any place in the city I live in, and find a random dealer willing to give me that same service using my local fiat.

I'm sorry, what? Do you mean that the hotel owner hired IHG to manage the property for him?
Charlie, I know you are a hype man and all that, but please, cut the bullshit.
That's not "corporate run". IHG hires 1-2 guys for you and that's about it. They are local dudes. 
The corporation doesn't swarm you with "top men" capable of changing the operations/practicies of a multinational corporation. These guys don't have a say in corporate policy or anything. If this was a 1,000 unit trophy property with a Crowne Plaza flag located on Park avenue or something, I could see IHG bending over backwards to make sure it's run at peak shape.
This is about all you get:  
It's like saying my McDonalds franchise is "corporate run" because they found a highschool kid to "manage" the restaurant for me. I can do whatever I want with my franchise, so long as it doesn't breach the franchise rules or tarnishes the brand reputation. At the end of the day, those manager(s) anwer to me. If I tell the manager to accept diamonds instead of fiat, he won't care so long as the proper franchise fees are paid in whatever way the franchisor deems acceptible. 
 
Sounds to me like the local owner (In Park Slope? Coudln't swing it in Manhattan, Charlie boy? You'd probably have a shot getting Toshi to let you use his hotel on 26th street. He seems to be pretty open minded.) is willing to accept bitcoin as a payment so long as he can convert enough to pay off IHG for its licensing/managment expenses. Obviously, since you are trying to profit by using the name of a well known company, I would guess that IHG does not have a provision in the managment/licensing agreement that forbids advertising such payment schemes with their name attached. Hell, they probably need all the good press they can get with that brand. 
But let me give you the benefit of the doubt for a second. 
You talked to corporate, and told them "hey, bitcoin!" and they said "Hey! We love dealing with people recently indicted for drug-related money laundering." And after intense negotations, they decided to start you out... in a ...holiday inn express ... in Park slope? Not a huge vote of confidence.
Anyways, even if this is successfully implimented, I have no idea how you are going to convince independantly owned and operated franchises to universally except bitcoin. Corporate sure as hell isn't going to mandate it in its franchising agreements. Unless you are planning to go door-to-door with this, it's going to take a long time to convert even a fraction of the total holiday inn locations in the united states.

You really see no difference between a bit coin, and a physical asset such as gold, stock, or property? 
Gold is a real object, and can be used to do real things. I bought gold recently and used it to make another object which I sold for a profit.
Stock is a real object, its an obligation for a certain percentage of the assets and cashflow of a company with assets and cashflow. Should a company go bankrupt, stock owners can theoretically claim a piece of the assets at liquidation.
Property is a real asset that can be used to make real money or house your family. If you buy a house, you have claim over that house forever, so long as you maintain it and it doesn't blow up or something. Even then, you'd have insurance on it and get at least some of the money back and still own the land.
Bitcoin has no physical usage, has no protection, has no backing anywhere by anyone. It has no usefulness in itself industrially or if the bitcoin market were to collapse. 
Can you really not see the difference?

Real money (backed by millions of people and a $16 trillion/year economy, and all the tax money levied on the people who work and use the products of this economy, and a whole country full of land and resources that is owned and managed by people that use that currency and back the currency with income via taxes from that land and those resources, and the largest and most advanced army on the planet that protects the land and the money that land uses) is not a cult, it's a ponzi. Similar psychological conditioning and personality, different reasoning.
Dogecoin is proof positive of this. Everyone hates on doge coin, despite it being exactly the same as real money (except not backed by millions of people and a $16 trillion/year economy, and all the tax money levied on the people who work and use the products of this economy, and a whole country full of land and resources that is owned and managed by people that use that currency and back the currency with income via taxes from that land and those resources, and the largest and most advanced army on the planet that protects the land and the money that land uses) in almost every way. I am not currently a proponent of either DIGITAL currency as they are both fraught with trolls and speculators, but if real money people call out doge and bitcoin as being fake or whatever (and suddenly lost the backing of millions of people and a $16 trillion/year economy, and all the tax money levied on the people who work and use the products of this economy, and a whole country full of land and resources that is owned and managed by people that use that currency and back the currency with income via taxes from that land and those resources, and the largest and most advanced army on the planet that protects the land and the money that land uses), they are only making fun of themselves and proving the trolls right.
Does that help highlight the SUBTLE differences?

Because Iran is ruled by a theocratic dictatorship that uses SS-style tactics via a group of zealot mercenaries called the Basij to bring murder and mayhem to dissenters, enforce strict muslim codes and enable silent atrocities against the citizenry. The basij ruling body reports to a group called the IRGC, a branch of Iran's military. The IRGC created a special forces group called the Quds Force. This group is said to spend most of it's time spreading the ideals of extremist revolution in the middle east, supposedly aiding the taliban, as well as groups such as hezbollah, hamas, and islamist networks in Iraq responsible for planting roadside bombs. They have also been accused of aiding the Syrian government with weapons and support to help stop the uprisings there, and attempting to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador to the united states.
It took me approximately 10 minutes to google this information.

If scammers are given membership and the ability to vote, and they pay for the continued operation of the foundation, they have at least a modicum of influence in how the foundation and its other members behave. Now, I know you guys are okay with shady people paying you to do stuff, but this isn't going to cut it with mainstream consumers, or even morally conscious consumers.

The majority (aka 99%) have not heard of bitcoin, so it's a fair leap in logic to assume that those people effectively treat bitcoin as if it didn't exist... since they hadn't heard of it before, and are at such a point that hearing about bitcoin provokes them into searching "what is bitcoin?" when they do find out about it.




... He just said that... how can you agree with him, and say exactly what he just said... and say he's wrong. Is he right or wrong? Did bitcoin effectively not exist to the masses because they hadn't heard of it, or did it effectively exist to the masses despite them never hearing about it?
According to the topic of this thread, people apparently don't know anything about it, otherwise the search term "what is bitcoin" wouldn't have any trending pattern at all unless people just started hearing about it topically. So saying dogecoin's sudden popularity is not a fair comparison, despite both dogecoin and bitcoin effectively reaching the same "masses" around the same time frame (6 months - 1 year) is a bit ridiculous. 
IN FACT, let me go a bit further and post the search numbers:
The global search volume for the bitcoin related keyword was:
In April 2013: 74,000.
In March 2014: 201,000
According to x99x, the global search volume for the dogecoin related keyword was:
"239,842% (70 vs 167,960)"
So within a year, dogecoin gained 167,890 new searches. While bitcoin gained 127,000 new searches. 
Sounds to me like dogecoin is winning both in percentage growth AND actual user growth.
Let me know when bitcoin gets its own nascar sponsorship. Maybe you guys can chip in and sponsor a formula 1 car and hope for the best?

Nothing unless it was needed for something, or produced something beneficial to the owner. In my assumption, this is an empty, plain, blank card. While the credit card company that made it has a ton of practical value, This card doesn't "command" the card company to any action in itself. The card company has to voluntarily offer its services and credit to the owner of the card, and beyond that user at that time, does not.
The bit coin protocol is the card company, bitcoin is the issued card, but the card itself does nothing other than represent value to other potential card holders. Trying to buy the cards just because of the company it came from is a foolish idea.

That's some of the PROS of government. Limiting the direct control of people is one of the WANTED benefits! Legitimate limited violence! Rome did this by literally having 2+ dudes kill each other in front of thousands of people all day everyday. Romans were literally murdering people all over the world, and the world calls them one of the greatest and most historically positive empires of human history. They also built the infrastructure that lead to modern western civilization. Do you really think we'd be better off if people had no one to keep them in check? Did civilization really benefit when the barbarians sacked Rome? WE HAD THE DARK AGES AFTER THAT. Do you think that without a government we would have LESS problems than our ancestors did when they thought 95% of a population had to die before they "lost or won" a war and had all the women and children enslaved and raped and murdered? At the end of the day, murder and violence is a requirement, but only when it has a calculated purpose (government) and not when it's the whim of lunatics (normal people). Nazi germany was considered the "rule of the people" whether hitler was a dictator or not, he was popular and became leader for a reason. When void of real government, that's the kind of people who take power. 
Without government, men would rule over men. Have you never heard of the crusades, or feudalism or tribal warfare? Africa is a great example of what happens when a central government repeatedly fails to control people. What the hell do you think happens when there's no one to tell these roaming bands of idiots to not kill and rape people while stealing their stuff and destroying everything in their path?
True government doesn't have an emotional compromise, and the difference between a roaming band of idiots killing people and a government's army is that the government's army doesn't want to kill those people and will stop when ordered, but the roaming band sure as hell won't.

"Bitcoin is dying. Here's why that's not a problem for bitcoin."
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:06:31
Let's see:
1. Offers higher (false) returns than other investments: CHECK
2. The source of all profits for early adopters is based on the "investment" from later adopters: CHECK
3. Requires ever increasing flow of new investors (I.e, as more people use bitcoin, the higher bitcoin will go! HODL TO THE MOON!): CHECK
4. Initially the promoter(s) (you filthy people, like Charlie shrem/Kerpels/Androponosososososo) will pay out high returns to attract more investors (cheap (sometimes free!) coins), and to lure current investors into putting in additional money (buy before the moon!). Other investors begin to participate, leading to a cascade effect (more people = higher returns. Less people = price falls). The "return" to the initial investors is paid out of the investments of new entrants, and not out of profits (older "investors" sell to "new entrants"  at an inflated price, or just hold the coins assuming the inflated market price = unrealized profit: CHECK
5. Often the high returns encourage investors to leave their money in the scheme, with the result that the promoter does not have to pay out very much to investors (HODL!!!!). If you didn't hold, bitcoin would lose market value like crazy since the entire reason why the price had originally been increasing was because everyone is holding (well, except the smart people who sold to you schmucks in the first place): CHECK
6. Promoters also try to minimize withdrawals by offering new plans to investors, often where money is frozen for a longer period of time (BFL, Gox, CoinBase, wallets, buy bitcoin as you use it schemes, other pre-orders and "investments" into new startups: CHECK
7.The promoter vanishes (SATOSHI and many others): CHECK
8. Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher returns, once investment slows down, the scheme collapses as the promoter starts having problems paying the promised returns (The current market tumble): CHECK
9. External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008), cause many investors to withdraw part or all of their funds (not yet but soon!): Not check
Just because it's a pyramid scheme AND a ponzi scheme, doesn't mean it doesn't have the characteristics of either SEPARATELY. Fyi.

"Cost Per Transaction 	$44.89"
According to blockchain.info, bitcoin is one of the most expensive payment processors in the world. The cost reward for mining bitcoin is roughly $45/transaction at the current price. Alternatively, this means that for the current transaction volume average of $1,335/transaction, that transaction costs 3.4%. This includes the "churn" when people send bitcoins to themselves, or mining pools to their users, etc, which would appear to make up over 80% of all transactional volume (purchase and sales being the other 20%).
 Then you have cost of risk in holding bitcoin, costs of using computers/phones to do the transaction using electricity and bandwidth, the cost of buying and selling bitcoins (bid and ask spreads are currently around $4, so every time you buy and sell a bitcoin on the market, you pay a random guy $4), the cost of taxes on gains from using bitcoins at a value higher than their purchase price, and of course, the unquantifiable risk of sending coin to the wrong address or getting scammed by a merchant without the ability to reverse the payment.
This also doesn't count fees or other transaction related costs from using 3rd party wallets or platforms like coin base. Unlike card processors, the transaction fee is actually pushed to new adopters via the mining principle. When a new block gets mined, all those coins are technically fees that are paid for old adopters using their coins by new buyers. Also, since mining increases the amount of bitcoin on the market, if no new buyers entered the market, the cost would switch back to older adopters as the market value of coins would lower in proportion to the increase of supply given no (or low) increases in demand, giving a silent tax on all bitcoin users.
Also, since mining is "blind", bitcoin "charges" small transactions as much as large transactions, which means that the bitcoin starts to becomes as cheap a platform as a typical creditcard company around the time an average transaction value is roughly $2700. This means that only the bitcoin rich can currently say that transaction fees are low. The rest of you bitcoin middleclass/poor are actually proportionally paying fees that are multiples of the fees of payday loans or other shark-like transaction services.
The current average transactions per block is 350, with a "artificial" maximum potential of 4,500 transactions per block, the minimum cost for a transaction would be $3.5 at the current market price of $630. If bitcoin prices doubled, so would the effective fee unless transactions per block doubled. In the next few years, the cost per transaction should decrease with the halving process, but in order for miners to make any money, they'd NEED bitcoin prices to spike to cover the fact that they get half the rewards.
TLDR: This whole topic is bull.

This is the percentage of total mined bitcoins. Its scary to consider that these coins may represent a substantial percentage of the active bitcoin market, which are coins that are not stored and are readily "for sale/available" to the market. I'm interested in knowing what percentage of total bitcoins mined are actually in circulation, and what percentage these stolen coins represent compared to that amount.
Two issues come to mind:
1) The criminals have an almost zero cost basis in these coins. This means that either option they choose will not be good for the market. They could potentially explode the market with a massive supply cut, or they could implode the market with a massive supply increase.
2) The criminals may have stolen circulated coins, which means that these criminals may be the main players (Imagine if 20% of all bitcoins are actually circulated, and these guys now own roughly 60% of those coins) in the overall bitcoin market and thus directly manipulating the market based on their desires. If they stole only uncirculated coins, the market wouldn't change much so long as they do nothing with the coins. However, if they were to suddenly make those coins accessibly on the market, supply of circulated coins may multiply in a relatively short timeframe, thus crashing the market.
This is a scary thought, especially considering the total value of bitcoin is based entirely on the amount of bitcoins and the current market price. It has zero assets that can be quantified outside of bitcoins available. Basically, roughly 12% of the entire asset value of the bitcoin economy went missing.
Now let's compare this with the total value of the united states. The m2 money supply of the US is currently estimated to be roughly $10.5 Trillion. This counts all usd in circulation and in liquid savings (note, this doesn't include t-bills, investments in domestic and foreign vehicles of any type (stocks, land, etc) as they are not considered as liquid as "cash" or "cash like"). The m2 is roughly 5% the size of the estimated total value of US economic assets, which is currently estimated at $208 trillion. These assets represent roughly 13x the US GDP, which is projected to be $16 trillion. On top of this, the US generates tax revenue of around $5 trillion. 
The big bad bailout, which everyone here considers to be outright theft of the usd by corporations with the help of the fed, is estimated to have cost us $609 Billion over the last 6 years, of which only $237 Billion hasn't been repaid yet. So the bailout took roughly 6% of liquid available USD, .2% of the total assets of the american economy, and roughly 4% of the US GDP. Also note, this assumes that we never get repaid or are ever made better off from this spent money. We are assuming it's just "gone" like the bitcoins that were stolen from the people.
Had the USD been subject to the same amount of stolen money, we'd have roughly $25 TRILLION completely MISSING within a few months with no idea where it went, at least if we are assuming the total market value of the entire US economy. If we are just using available liquid usd related holdings, it's more like $1.3 Trillion. Roughly 2x the TARP program.
In terms of relative value, these stolen coins did more damage than 2 TARPS at the same time, and all that money was 100% stolen with no way to get it back, and no one held accountable. Sounds familiar.

Since joining this subreddit, I have become radically opposed to bitcoin in its current state specifically because of the attitudes I have observed here.

You are looking at the wrong side of the chart. Of course someone who wants to purchase 3k bitcoins would have to climb the price wall, and that's why most buyers do it over the course of days or months to prevent overpaying.
If you wanted/needed to dump 4k bitcoins, good luck getting an average closing price above $300 if you don't pace it over weeks of selling.

@_date: 2014-05-07 09:14:01
Everyone keeps comparing bitcoin with stock or a company... but forget to mention that stocks and companies actually produce things and sell them for a profit. Bitcoin is the product that is being sold for a profit in itself. The only reason mining exists is to produce bitcoins, which is used to make transactions within the bitcoin system, which give miners something to mine. It's a loop. It's a closed system with no external meaning or value generation. If mining was used to process creditcard transactions, and the result of the mining was a service fee paid by outside users, then we'd have something to play with, but it's not even that! Even an arcade coin machine has more productive value than the bitcoin system as it is today. The owner of the arcade turns useless coins into useable currency, the people who trade in the cash for coins do so because they can then turn the useless coins into playtime with games exclusive to the arcade. Its a stupid system for anyone but the arcade owner.
In it's current form, bitcoin is basically an arcade coin machine for an arcade with no exclusive games. Random dudes are coming in and trading their own games with each other using those coins for no real reason. The only reason people are putting money into the machine is because the other people in the arcade say its cool and will only trade their games with those coins for whatever reason. Honestly, all logic breaks down when you walk through the door. 
In reality, buying bitcoin is like buying a macbook case and expecting the price of macbook cases increase in value because the amount of people who will potentially need a macbook case will potentially increase. Note how I am saying "macbook case" because a macbook at least has a productive use outside of its potential as a speculative investment protocol.

He doesn't want to stick fingers in HIS ears. He wants to be able to pitch his "investment" to someone else at a higher price in the near future. Take $1,000 and buy a ferrari in the future from his "gains: by using the simple internet marketing scheme. It's a lot harder to accomplish this when not everyone is going "buy buy buy!" in the background.
Have you seen the movie boiler room? Foolish investors love hearing/seeing the "buy buy buy!" frenzy as it allows them to make a decision without using their brains. The tech and housing bubbles before the burst were known for this behavior. It's a proven way to sell something for more than it's real value.

Not bitcoin itself. Jpmorgan has the same basic technology, but the idea of OPEN SOURCE bitcoin like technology is what gets him going. Whether bitcoin as we know it becomes worthless or not doesn't matter to him, so long as something similar that is open source exists.
If you think he's expecting bitcoin to go to $1000000000/btc, you are mistaken.
The major reason anyone here cares about bitcoin is that they bought at X and it will be worth Y. Do not tell me otherwise, because no one takes risks for something that won't return something of value somehow.

Simplifying what he did to make it sound benign isn't a proper logical leap. If this were the case, pretty much any bad or illegal activity is easily simplified into sounding harmless to prove a false point.

Non aggression principle? He actively did an illicit activity, that's a form of aggression you raging tool.
Also, this isn't about the ACT itself, but how a person tried to make the act sound benign logically by simplifying the means of the transaction without including the intent and circumstances that are leading to these legal issues. I can shoot you and make it sound benign ("Oh he just fell on the bullet" being a common joke regarding this), but the circumstances around that action can be taken either as an aggressive act or a non aggressive act. Saying "he just traded bitcoin for money" completely strips the circumstances behind the action which are what is being considered legal or not. Stop being so obtuse.
And he didn't "just speak some words" he "acted" by doing currency transactions that were illegal and known to be considered money laundering for a criminal drug dealer, which can lead to a)killing people and b) hurting people, depending on how high up you view the story from.

You guys keep talking about the value, yet none of these features have been turned into a value realizer. 
All the features noted are nothing more than theoretical/abstract benefits. I feel like I'm reading a credit card advert.
I am further lead to believe bitcoins(the part that people pay for) are a product, and all this spiel is just a sales pitch. The only problem is that the represented features do not provide any value, they are just features. Bitcoins have to develop a practical aspect in order to tap into any potential value that they may have. Until then, this is all nonsense. I rather trade a steam item than a bitcoin, because I don't have to pay $400 to have one to trade. Using bitcoin is like an economy centered around live strong bracelets or cans of coke. They all technically do about the same, but bitcoin costs 10,000% more.

We call this "circlejerking" "being a bitcoin shill" "being dumb" "blind" or a myriad of other names, which are all oddly common on r/bitcoin.
The reason why "mt.gox is dying" is because it is not overpricing bitcoins and instead is exposing issues in the protocol that might otherwise cause the price of bitcoin to not go to the moon. Some say that mt.gox is specifically trying to undermine the market, because most of the market downturns originate from mt.gox... but this is laughable because for most of bitcoin history, mt.gox was the only place where an actual market existed, so when the market went down due to simple supply/demand and fear, the shills decided to blame mt.gox as a being and not just "the market" doing what it does.
Despite mt.gox potentially having the largest store of actively tradable bitcoins (aka the market), the largest transaction volume despite it's restrictions on withdrawals and transfers, r/bitcoin has to lie to itself and others to make it appear as if mt.gox has no "relevance" anymore, despite potentially having THE LARGEST relevance of any exchange around. Think lehman brothers in 2008. 
Propaganda 101 is to discredit those people or things that do not support the "Accepted view". Anyone who thinks bitcoin has issues will immediately get downvoted or called out as a form of discrediting. Mt.gox is just the latest "enemy of the state" in the eyes of the r/bitcoin pumpers.

What flawed logic. It's relatively stable, it's easy to insure and receive, it's widely used and accepted and has very low technical or financial barriers of entry. Everything in the world is priced in fiat, and can be exchanged easily for whichever fiat is needed to make that purchase. 
Using fiat is pretty logica from the standpoint of an average person.

Step 1: Buy bitcoins from someone who was able to convince you to buy some.
Step 2: Tell everyone how amazing bitcoin is and how its worth way more than you bought it for, then downvote or demonize anyone who doesn't agree with false logic and poor arguments.
Step 3: Hope bitcoin doesn't collapse in price by 20% in a single day from a small, supposed non-event such as mt.gox going down and not giving customers their money or bitcoin back (potentially ever) or apple pulling a small app with under 200k users (to compare, angry birds has over 500x that many downloads).
Step 4: Sell to the next sucker you convince to buy bitcoin from you at a huge premium to what you bought it for only months or days before.
Step 5: Profit.

Ponzi schemes do not make any money outside of attracting funds from outsiders. They also tend to have no assets to speak of. The leader would take more new money from "investors", and pay the older investors based on their "deserved" interest rate. This is an exponential issue, and within a few years would require an insane amount of capital just to preserve the returns of older investors... with nothing other than that return to show for the investment. No, that's what bitcoin does.
Bonds are issued to pay for government expenses. Government expenses are things like roads, police, war, food subsidies, welfare, etc.
Unlike a ponzi, the "income" given to investors is via "taxpayers" who pay a certain amount of money in exchange for not living in some 3rd world hellhole dying of a random disease. Its protection money...and in exchange for allowing you to do business and make profits safely, you pay them a cut of your business income.
Investors in bonds may be taxpayers, or may be guys in china. They take the "risk" of giving the government extra sources of capital in exchange for a "Safe" fixed return guaranteed by the tax revenues of all the people who live and work in that country. Generally, every dollar spent by the government translates into an increased ability by its citizens to continue making profits and growing business. 
If bonds were a ponzi scheme, then we'd have no military, no police, no services or welfare systems at all. We'd just end up missing money with random people becoming rich for no reason with no assets to show for it. It's just air (or computer bits) that say something is there, but isn't. One day, it's just gone (or stolen, hacked, forgotten,  spent, etc).

I never concluded that. I'm of the opinion that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme or scam used to take money from the dumb and give it to those with who aren't via clever marketing. Pyramid scheme 2.0.
What I am doing is taking your (general bitcoin community) "logic" for adopting bitcoin and throwing it in your face because of it's obvious hypocrisy and ignorance of reality. You claim bitcoin is different and better from "fiat" and yet I constantly find holes in these conclusions, large enough to drive a truck and 2 tanks through.
Give me a solid, unchangeable ideal of what bitcoin is for. And from this conclusion, I will see if I can find any evidence contrary. If not, I will shut up immediately.
So far, I have heard: 
1. Decentralization and removed from fiat: Bitcoin is not decentralized, in fact, all transactions are verified by a single, "centralized" block chain. In order to ensure fast transactions, all funds are either located in 3rd party banks or use services that are technically a centralized institution in which multiple people give money for safe keeping. Mining pools are a collective of miners under a centralized system of mining to increase efficiency. All bitcoin transactions are based on prices that are made in fiat representations, and are constantly being heralded by this sub, from "BTC going to be worth $100,000?!" to "Bitcoin crashed $400 today, buying opportunity!".  Whenever a sovereign country or company "bans" bitcoin, the price falls and people have to come on here and assure those people into not selling.
2. Untraceable: We know this isn't right, silkroad and that one dude who got caught for money laundering are good examples of how traceable it is. In fact, there has been a recent shift away from this assertion as some sort of pride, when it was previously used as a rallying cry.
3. Unhackable because of physics: People are a lot easier to hack than computers. Good luck removing that weak part of the chain.
4. Uncorrupt: 90% of bitcoins owned by a minority of the "early adopters" who can either all sell and crash the market, or all buy (or just hold) and make the market increase drastically. This is the exact same power that any other corrupt institution or government has on fiat.
5. Easier transactions: Takes 10 minutes to an hour to conduct the transaction and a myriad of services and processes. This is a straight out lie.
6. Inflation proof: Wrong. Whenever the price goes lower instead of higher, this is technically inflation. If the "early adopters" were to increase bitcoin supply by allowing their massive holdings of bitcoin to be purchasable on the market, inflation would be exponentially higher than any monetary movement by a fiat system due to the illiquid nature of the bitcoin network.

The reason they "caused" the crash is because &gt;50% of the bitcoins traded on the market go/went through mt gox. It is the source of a majority of the market moves because the majority of people transacted through it and used it as storage.
Mtgox is just an exchange in a free market, so blaming them for the actions of market participants that use it is just silly.

Simple question: Why would a guy 10x more rich and powerful than the winklecunts be butthurt about 2 retards with an economic deathwish??

Another day, another article with a crazy "bitcoin to moon" title refering to an article with zero relation to the title. If the poster could read (I question if you guys are even literate, or just completely ignorant), the article is almost always neutral or even negative towards bitcoin... or has nothing to do with bitcoin except a question or mention or speculation made by the article writer (shockingly on a bitcoin supporting blog/news site).
Sometimes you guys turn into alchemists:
For example: "Fed chairman makes a joke about buying a bitcoin and then finding out he bought it from Madoff and loses all his money" would transform into:
"Fed chairman admits he has purhcased bitcoin!" or "Fed chairman admits fiat is a ponzi and has all his assets in bitcoin".
In this case, the author of the article transmutes a dialogue about the cost of paper money and why people still use it (in the presense of modern systems) and contorts it into his own OP ED article (which would be fine if he at least tried to quote or acknowledge who said what). Did the author actually quote this professor? Is this the professor's actual writing or is the author just offering an anecdote? 
Despite the author's obvious bias, bitcoin is only mentioned 1-2 times when directly refering to other options instead of cash for illegal activites and drugs. Furthermore, the text boldly states "Cash is unlikely to disapear" into an article with the bold headline "time to phase out (paper money) and use bitcoin?".
Of course, the OP just read the headline and the first... 5 sentances of the article, and in an amazing example of parataxic, telephone game style information transfer, we have the sensational title seen here. Grats OP. You are unreliable.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:06:15
Bitcoin logic is also circular. Bitcoin has value because it is used as a medium of exchange, but it's a medium of exchange because it has value, etc etc.
You guys in this subreddit love doing that. Making 1 sided statements and ignoring the small fact that the statement also applies to the thing you are "defending".
You cannot tamper proof anything. All bitcoin transactions must be verified by the block chain in order to be considered "real". Off-chain transacting requires significant trust in the 3rd party, which, like mtgox, are susceptible to fraud and hacking. The entire point of the 51% attack is to take advantage of the weaknesses in this verification process, which could effect systems like coinbase and paper wallet transactions. Remember, all off-chain transactions will be turned into "on chain" transactions at some point. Also, if you need to use a 3rd party to do "instant" transactions, you've defeated the point of using bitcoin in the first place, since you are more than likely giving all your personal information, getting charged a fee, needing a bank account or credit card attached, dealing with standard 3rd party issues, and have purchase and sale limits on "instant" transactions (such as): 
You give me a paper wallet at a store. I probably won't be able to "confirm" the payment until the end of the day when the retailer accounts for all the money made that day. If I am a smart retailer, I won't let you have the item until I can confirm that the wallet is properly funded, and get the funds from that wallet, which again requires a 3rd party and/or a 10-60 minute confirmation. (This is a lot more annoying than just taking cash or using a credit card at this point. I stood behind a guy who did this at a store once and it took like 20 minutes to finish the whole process!) Otherwise, between the time I give you the item and receive the wallet, and the time for me (the retailer) to check the authenticity of the wallet, you could have transacted some or all that money out of the wallet using a copy of wallet's key.

How have you "made money just today" with an investment that doesn't cashflow? Do you mean that your purchases have increased in value? If so, that's not making money. Making money is when you take something, sell it for more than you paid for it, or are able to generate a cashflow on that thing that is above the costs of holding that thing after all expenses and taxes. This is also known as profit.
You made a paper gain, and because you purchased $200k worth of bitcoins in such a small market, your entrance into the market made the price of bitcoin go up.
So.. what, will you tell us you are losing money if the market goes below your cost average? Doubt it.

None of them have ever heard of any off the higher ups or group leaders at the bank talking about bitcoin on their own volition. No memos, no meetings, no presentations. In fact, many of the higher ups know my friends are personally trading it and find the idea amusing but inconsequential beyond day trading.

Ya, who'd have thought a guy who makes money on buying things that are technically worthless, then making them worth lots of money would take something he owns and try to make it worth more than he bought it for through hype. No ulterior unbiased motives here.

Haha, I remember when calling BFL out as a scam would get you downvoted and hated by the community, because there was 100% no way it was a scam, and people saying so were just FUD shills.

Whenever I see a reporting about a bank on this subreddit, it's generally negative against the bank for a number of reasons, from "hey they money launder, why cant we" to "the bank had all these phd economists diss bitcoin, they are just trying to undermine the true power of bitcoin"
The second a bank on here says "we're experimenting with it" suddenly banks are NOT bad or antiquated, and this is amazing for bitcoin.

I have a new charity: Bitcoin loss fund.
This fund is established in the extremely likely event you all lose all your savings and end up homeless. Once you are all broke, the fund will send out solarpowered hot plates and tents for you guys to inhabit your local corrupt, fiat-statist-funded, park or camping area. No, we will not provide you with guns or riot gear when you finally decide to "revolt" against the evil corporatists when bitcoin fails and you go bankrupt.
Please donate now to support your future selves.
Thank you.

I don't use bitcoin, so I don't get scammed with this easy garbage. I'm glad the crooks can elect people like you to leadership though. Another solid reason not to buy into bitcoin :)

That's the funny thing of it all, isn't it? 
The other banks only started getting serious volume the days after mt.gox started having problems, which means people who did get out of gox moved to those banks, but since gox was still upwards of 50% of the trading volume until their trading pretty much ceased, I'd wager that upwards of 50% of tradable bitcoin is still in there somewhere. Simple logic.

Isn't bitcoin entirely a propaganda exercise? Straight from wiki: "Propaganda is a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of a population toward some cause or position."
Isn't that exactly what you guys are trying to do? Brainwash people to think YOUR way? So what makes you better than "the establishment"? Who are you and why should I trust you or your views?


It's inevitable because bitcoin's main attraction is the ability for people of varying moral and legal standings to transfer money secretly around the world. Bitcoin was designed for morally questionable people like this. Do you like the idea of supporting a system that helps kill people all over the world? If you are a monster, I guess you wouldn't.

The fed is paid to promote, while bitcoin people throw themselves at and prostrate to bitcoin while smashing their iphones at whoever doesn't support it. And they give money to bitcoin causes as a form of selfless donation for a "greater power" that does nothing for them.
Bit of a difference.

Gold is a real product or service. That's one of the main difference between a pyramid scheme and real investment. A pyramid scheme sells smoke that promises a future value or service, an investment has a current value or service.
Gold is physical and can be used for things in itself.
Bitcoin is built around being "decentralized and digital" aka nothing but code and mirrors.

Okay so... capitalism is bad for humanity because it creates the most progress... but bitcoin is okay because its progress is special for humanity(?)... and instead we have to change the system from which bitcoin was created (and from which bitcoin takes and multiplies it's worst aspects, I.E the killing of the middle class and the rise of an elite "early adopter" class at a frightening pace) in the first place in order to stop it from making other progress that might hurt humanity (and potentially bitcoin) more... but not bitcoin because that's apparently good for humanity according to people who support it.
Got it.

How many drug addicts have been revived after an overdose, continued to binge on drugs before "Really" dying.
@_date: 2014-01-29 03:39:01
Yes, but "chemistry" isn't illegal, as it's a neutral topic. Teaching a kid to make a bomb and helping him do it, IS ILLEGAL, and if that kid kills people with that bomb, you are an ACCOMPLICE.
Someone selling illegal drugs is doing something inherently ILLEGAL, because the ONLY result is an ILLEGAL/DAMAGING one. Giving people illegal unregulated drugs =/= teaching a kid what chemistry is.
You are using a false situation, and it's a really dumb way to justify a lack of logic.

Your username suits you. The main reason NO ONE on wallstreet is willing to spend more than a few thousand dollars on this product (not a currency or money) is because its so ILLIQUID. There is not enough trade volume to accurately invest in bitcoin at an institutional/fund level without defeating the whole point of investing into it.
The other reasons being that bitcoin has dropped in value by more than half within only a few months, its easy to lose, its got zero inherent value, its reputation is negative at best, it isn't used anywhere for anything, it can be "mined" for free but doesn't make any money at current difficulties and electricity costs, it has a lower adoption growth rate than dogecoin, it requires funds to hire a bitcoin person to actively manage any investments due to how volatile the market is, it has the return profile of a penny stock with the risk profile of a nigerian prince, it can be easily replaced by a better product (like dogecoin or litecoin or whatevercoin), owning it connotes a negative view towards the current economy and the government and/or fiat (which is a big no-no when your main job is to invest in those things), the numerous potential tax implications of reselling or losing bitcoin, the lack of historical data to allow accurate analysis of the product and trading patterns, the lack of faith in the people who are selling the coins, lack of knowledge about who else is buying the product and why, lack of knowledge about whether bitcoin will be banned in the next few months/years, lack of popularity amongst the people these wallstreet funds raise money from, lack of quantifiable value growth (bitcoins do not represent anything but themselves, and they do not produce income or control other assets that could be used to increase value for bitcoin holders), the fact that its seen as a scam by most smart money people, the fact that most smart money people have better things to do than spend a day trying to buy $10k worth of bitcoins while they could have made $10b worth of trades in the same amount of time, lack of leverage ability, no faith that the bitcoin market will not crash randomly for no reason, lack of faith in the concept of decentralization when these guys make all their money from being creation of centralization, lack of "bitcoin people" with the proper qualifications to apply to a job in said wallstreet firms and begin trading, fear in the knowledge that the amount of miners are decreasing due to lack of profitability and thus making bitcoin easier to manipulate and closer to extinction, the fact that everyone who supports bitcoin also hates these guys and would probably crash the market just to spite the 1%, the fact that deflationary currency is a dumb idea to begin with and these guys know enough about economics to know that this is a dumb idea too, the fact that bitcoin volitility prevents a fund from investing in bitcoins without constantly going through cycles of chaotic fund redemptions and clawbacks which would make fundmanagers hate life for little added value, the fact that deflationary products inherently force new entrants to pay excessive artificial premiums(the opposite of "buy low, sell high") for products with no commanding usage (like potable water after a hurricane) and shockingly subjective value in exchange , the fact that bitcoin in inherently monopolistic (like a cable company) and is thus a value destroyer. I could keep going but I think I made my point.

Its so piss easy to understand, but you are too stupid to figure
out the very basics... interesting.
Also, numbers cease to exist the second that sentient creatures no longer exist to imagine them. Your point is moot. Even if they did continue to exist, who the hell cares because we'd all be dead.

There was one shout out to bitcoin at the bottom from a twitter post related to pymnts I think.
Also, one of the conferences will be about bitcoim... so there will be discussion about it, but its not THE DISCUSSION. Still cool though.

More people downloaded "yo" app day 1 than all people who are currently involved in bitcoin since day 1. 
Considering the level of spam that bitcoin supporters throw all over the internet, the amount of people using it is pretty atrocious. 
Most of you consider religions to be retarded, but 64% of the world are religious, despite science, and reasoning, and tons of "fud" as you say going against it's adoption. People are very easy to manipulate, so you guys must be doing something wrong if you don't have at least 5% of the population supporting bitcoin yet. Christianity spread faster than bitcoin, and they didn't have the power of the internet, or proof, or science, or math.
