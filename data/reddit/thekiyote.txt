There was a time when the idea of banks issuing bills of exchange was radical and new fangled, but once they became more accepted and normal, the use changed over the centuries.

It's actually 4chan, which should also always be watched very closely.  Preferably by the FBI.

I'm not sure how this changes anything that was said...  
Someone had to first issue a bill of exchange (in the west, I believe that was Sweeden, and was short-lived), and the use of those banknotes changed over the centuries.

I BOUGHT THOSE SOCKS!  Uncomfortable things, I thought they were going to be super soft.  I ended up throwing them out.
I still have my bitcoin merit badge which cost me 1 bitcoin.  Still completely worth it.

So I have an almost identical story, and I'm perfectly okay with it.
I got into bitcoin right after it bounced to around $30-something dollars and then crashed back to a couple of dollars.  I mined a bunch, played around with using them as currency (mostly server time, but I also own [my bitcoin merit badge]( and then my computer's hard drive crashed.  I thought about trying to recover it, but the roughly $100 I would have recovered didn't seem worth it.
Whenever I tell this story, I get the inevitable "Oh, man!  What if you kept them!  You would be rich!", however, the fact was, I never in my wildest dreams expected it to be worth $7k, let alone what it was at the ATH.  
Investors at the time were being ridiculed, mostly because at that time the goal was an actual digital currency, not this idea of "digital gold" that is popular now, but the only thing you could possibly buy with it were nerdy trinkets and drugs.
I thought the tech was going to be huge, but I had no clue about the trajectory of bitcoin.  I was wrong, but I know I was in the majority of people who were wrong in the exact same way.

That could very well be.  I was never a huge gamer, so I never really paid attention to the virtual goods markets.  
I still think it was pretty nichey, though, and in most cases aimed at filling a grey market, offering the purchase of virtual items in ways that most companies didn't like.  The big one I remember is WoW getting upset about people buying/selling gold.
Interesting, but I wouldn't have bet BTC would reach $15,000 on it.  As was, $10-$20 tops.  I remember the general consensus being that the low-$30 price was a speculative bubble that would never be reached again.
The people who believed otherwise were the ones who made some to a ton of money.

For stability?  Gold.  For potential?  Bitcoin.
Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years.  It's day-to-day value might fluctuate, but as a commodity and store of value, it's not going anywhere.
There's a lot that can happen to bitcoin, from regulation to competition.  If I put my private keys in a safe deposit box for 30 years, or even six months, I cannot guarantee it will have retained any of it's initial value when I pull it out.
The flip side of that is that it could potentially _grow_ many times the current value.  The increased risk also increases the potential reward.
So, really, which you put your money in heavily depends on your risk tolerance and goals.

It's absolutely not, but it's a tale as old as any frontier.
First waves of settlers are usually attracted to the lawlessness of the frontier.  Maybe someone's after them, maybe not, but whatever the reason, they prefer losing their safety net than having somebody look over their shoulder.
The following waves of settlers come when they get news of the prosperity of the first wave.  These people are looking for wealth and riches, and do _not_ want to lose their safety net, and demand that the institutions that the first wave was trying to escape be brought with them.  And since these people have the numbers, they usually get their way.
Which, of course, pisses off the first wave.

Ditto, here.  I always pay attention to new cryptos, but to be honest, Doge was the first that *excited* me since bitcoin.

When I was in college, I went to Japan on a study abroad, and decided to not come back for a year.  I had no money.  I couldn't visit any of the sites outside of what was in my own region.  I stayed in the cheapest of places.  I would take the train into Osaka  to buy comics to resell on ebay to get money to eat.
I still think this was the best trip I have ever taken.  
Now that I'm about a dozen years older, I have traveled since then, with a fair bit more money to my name.  I've seen the sights.  I've stayed in nice places.  
But you end up in your own little world.  A hotel bar with a bunch of other foreigners is a very different place than the small red lantern tavern that you and the salary men would go to, because it was the cheapest place in your little neighborhood to grab a beer. 
Struggle is like spice:  some people don't like it, other people prefer to pile it on so much you can't taste anything else.  
You're right, it took money to get to Japan.  Money gave be the opportunity to get there.  But once I was there, it prevented me from not having a worse experience, but a _different_ one.  
And now that I'm older, I miss taking the train into Osaka, to buy comics, to resell on ebay to get money to eat...

I think it's ethically more complicated than that.
Really, there are two fair prices for the coins: the amount the kid, as an expert, could spend to replace them, and the amount the kid could gain if he sold them.  
If the mother asked for a list of the coins, bought them herself on ebay, and gave them to the kid, that would also be a fair resolution of the situation.
But since she went up to the kid, he treated the situation as if he _sold_ the coins to her son, for a fair value of retail, and he never paid him.
The kid wasn't generous with the mom, but I don't think he scammed her, either.  He just opted to not cut her any slack.  
Whether or not he _should_ have cut her some slack is another ethical question entirely.
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:41:26
Car insurance after your car is totaled works exactly like what this kid did:  they will look up the value of your car in the blue book, and send you a check for that amount.
If you're a deal hunter, and bought your car for less than that amount, you end up ahead.  If you did a lot of work on your car, and put in more than the blue book value, you end up behind.  
edit:  Insurance companies look for work first, then receipts, when after the damaged is assessed, they decide the car isn't totaled.  Then you get the work done, and send them the bill.

I had this kinda happen to me during the last recession.  Not with cryptocurrencies, but I lucked into a good job just when the recession was kicking into high gear.  It allowed me to buy a foreclosed condo in a section of a city I could never have afforded otherwise.
Part of me hopes crypto moons and the housing market crashes again, so I can maybe do it again, but I know that that's unlikely.  So I just hope for crypto mooning.

Which is funny, because that's exactly what the money changers in Jesus's time did:  they would exchange Greek and Roman money from pilgrims for Jewish money (for a fee, of course), which could be spent at the temple, which also acted as a marketplace.
Also, the bible isn't 100% clear on whether Jesus was completely against the act of money changing, or if he was against the act of using the holy grounds as a place of commerce.  
[In all]( [four]( of the]( [gospels]( it wasn't just the money changers that were kicked out, but _everybody_ who was using the grounds as a marketplace.  
And I've yet to see someone interpret those passages as Jesus being against **all** forms of commerce...

At least they gave you the option to call and appeal.  
A year ago, after using them for more than 10 years, PayPal emailed me, saying they banned my account for violating their acceptable use policy.  No details.  No reason.  I thought it was spam, until a few days later, I couldn't use the account anymore.
No matter how many times I called them, they refused to give me a reason or reactivate my account.  To this day, I don't know what caused them to cancel it.  I just used the account for the occasional ebay or etsy purchase.

Heh, yeah... Still made a fair bit off of dogecoins.  It was exactly what the cryptocurrency space needed at the time.
I've since moved most of them into other things, mostly XRP.

Back when bitcoin was worth around $2, I had about 50 btc on a hard drive that crashed.  Tried to get it back, but it was gone.  I thought, that sucks, I'm out $100.
Now, seven years later, I _still think "that sucks, was out $100".  
I didn't lose $350k, I lost $100.  If I _kept_ it, I would have had $350,000, but I didn't have a crystal ball, so it's not worth beating myself up over.

For $5 invested to pass $1 million, bitcoin would need to double a little less than 19 times.
On 12/24/2016, bitcoin's value was $897.99.
So, with $897.99 * 2^19 , the value of bitcoins would need to reach $470,805,381.12/BTC for son to become a millionaire off of his $5 initial investment.
edit:  Oops, he bought the BTC for his son last week.  I'm too lazy to redo the math, just assume it's much larger.

I think their compliance departments are still separate.
I say this as someone who is permabanned by PayPal, but can still use Venmo (though I'm just waiting for that shoe to drop, too).

When that happens, and somebody makes a purchase for the _uncommon_ meaning of "DCB" and the government catches them, they trace the purchase to the bank, fine them hundreds of million dollars, and, even worse for the bank, the news catches wind of it and the article "Bank Helps Domestic Terrorist Fund Next Bombing!" goes viral.  
In this case, DCB isn't all that common of an acronym, even for legitimate uses, so PayPal doesn't mind annoying a small set of their customers to prevent those million dollars of cost.
In fact, I would say that the OP got off easy.  At least he got an appeal.  Frequently, PayPal will just ban users rather than having to deal with them, which is the _real_ reason why I think they're a massively shit company.

What people forget is that people _also_ benefit from banks lending them money.  Anyone who has gotten a mortgage, auto loan, line of business credit, or even a smart phone payment plan has benefited from credit being available to them.
If currency was deflationary, and holding money was a risk free way of increasing your wealth, the cost of credit is going to go up significantly because the supply of money to lend would go down.  
Ending fractional reserves would have a similar effect.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:39:48
Inflation is a tax on holding, and not investing, savings.
I think bitcoin is a good example of a deflationary asset.  People buy and hold it because the value of potential growth is greater than the utility value it brings in using it as a currency.

And gold is actually a rock we dig out of the ground, and bitcoin is a bunch of numbers we run through a graphics card.
All of these things have no inherent value, just the value we assign to it, which fluctuates, and even crashes at times.

At work, I was known as the guy who, after a few beers, would start talking about cryptocurrencies.
A year ago, the reputation would get me eye rolls.  Now, it's making people ask me to teach seminars on the topic.

Just talking about deflation, the interest rates on loans are high not because of the amount being borrowed, but because of the supply of money available to be loaned.
Holding money is as risk free as you get.  It doesn't really happen in inflationary environments because you're essentially paying a premium to hold in the loss of value due to it (the bank tax the OP was talking about).
But in a deflationary environment, your wealth is growing while you hold.  There are going to be more people who choose not to invest, dropping supply, which according to the golden rule of economics, will cause the price of a loan to go up.
To be fair, this might be counteracted by a similar drop in depand, since lendees are effectively having the cost of the loan go up over the lifetime of the loan, since their premiums will be locked in but the value of the dollar is going up.  This would cause people looking to purchase something to favor saving vs. credit, since the cost of goods would drop in time.  
However, there are good arguments that this would slow the growth of industry.
Also, I've never thought about specifically denying the use of FRB for home purchases before.  I'd have to think about unintended consequences, but I see the logic on how it would be a very good way for a government to keep home and property prices very low relative to the rest of the economy.

Yup, and I'd add that PwC probably just donated money for the financial literacy program.  I highly doubt they had any hand in what the content is.  That's all on Time for Kids. 
Also, the common core standards are about the math this worksheet covers, not about bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2018-11-12 20:15:45
That's the PwC charitable foundation.  They're probably donating money for the financial literacy program, who are trying to teach new topics, of which Bitcoin is one of them.  The likelyhood they directly had anything to do with writing about bitcoin is tiny.

That's how I want to be.  I'm just about hitting that 35 age, and am afraid of that stagnation happening to me.
People stop learning for all the same reasons they stop exercising:  They get busy, and it's easier not to. Then after a while, they get behind and see starting again as an even harder task.  After a while, they eventually start to think it's something they could _never_ do.
It's not good, but it is common.  I see it a lot in family members and older friends.  The ones who do the best are the ones who never quite gave in to the whole "this is a young person's game" mindset.

I'm curious, do you or did you work in the tech field?  Or have it as a hobby?  
I just ask because that can make an idea like bitcoin more comfortable if you already understood the base components.  If, for example, you had an understanding of cryptography, computers, the internet, and the need for a digital money, bitcoin doesn't seem that strange.  It's not a large leap.
But once you start dropping things, the idea seems more alien.  My mother (early-60s) probably understands about half the concepts that are in bitcoin, and she's definitely intimidated by it, because she cannot piece the whole thing together.
A kid/young person just sort of accepts it as a single concept.

I don't doubt he's for real either.  I just wish he wasn't.
I honestly do think there's an issue with women in the IT/tech fields, but for the most part I don't think it's something as blatant as people saying they don't want women to join their companies, but rather a whole bunch of small things that don't seem bad on their own, but it all adds up to making it harder for a woman to break into the field than it is for a man.  I think it's hard for both sides because there really isn't anybody to blame, it's just a problem that needs to be solved one tiny step at a time.
And then a guy like this shows up, and it's like, are you for real?  I thought we were past this...
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:15:49
Yeah.  It shows in other ways too.
For a while I was the head of an IT department for a library.  It always felt really weird to me how, in an industry dominated by women, I still only got one woman applicant for about every ten guys.  It obviously wasn't reflected in the STEM programing we did for kids, so I just hope it was a generational thing, that was slowly changing.

The graph goes from block 481,824 to 489,025.  That's 7,201 blocks.
Estimating a block every 10 minutes, that 72,010 minutes, or roughly 50 days.

I always judged whether or not something is a cold wallet based on how it's used, which is as an offline cryptocurrency store, and less its security.  
If I'm a daytrader, and have a ledger as an offline bankroll that I send a percentage of my profits to, that's a cold wallet.  If I need to pull some money from it during a bad run, I might be comfortable enough with its built in security to plug it in and transfer coins from it, and then keep reusing it as a cold wallet.
An exchange (or a paranoid person) would _not_ be comfortable with that.  It would be too large of a risk.  That's where you have the never-online deep cold storage, like you described.  
Likewise, a person who creates and prints a paper wallet from an unprotected online computer also has created a cold wallet, just one with so large of a security hole that it's almost pointless.

So, the Y-axis is percentage difference from the start of the bear market.  That point on the red line represents a much much lower relative BTC price than the blue is currently at.  
That said, while we're seeing a clear pennant at the exact same percentage drop that BTC broke out of the last bear market at, the absolute price is a lot higher now than it was back then.  
Because of that, I think we're probably going to have another pennant form, with a flagpole height of around $17-18k, before we break $20k and reach a new ATH.

And there have been times in history where did that, most recently Japan through the 90s and 00s, and the problem is that while it makes sense ethically, it doesn't work out all that great for the economy.
People buying stuff means companies invest in producing more, which means more workers, who also buy stuff, more technology, who need to also employ people, who also buy stuff, and so on.
When people start putting their money under their mattresses, all of that grinds to a halt.

The problem with most mathematical models is that they make assumptions that fail to track to human behavior.  
If I were to take a look at all the points that I could invest $50,000 into BTC, it will, on average, be better than trying to cost average over the same period.
However, if you take a look at _when_ people tend to make their first investment, you'll see that it doesn't neatly spread evenly over the whole investment history.  Instead, you'll see that the number of new investors jumps during a bull market and drops during a bear.  From this perspective, you might be better off DCAing the investment, to capitalize on the correction.
Another thing is that cryptocurrencies are a risky investment (that risk is why we stand to make a ton of gains).  If you're perfectly rational, and know the exact amount you want to invest in cryptocurrencies, lump sums make sense, but most people underestimate the risk during the FOMO of a bull market.
In that situation, DCA can help nudge people to a reasonable level of risk, by framing investments in terms of a percentage of your paycheck, instead of cashing out your retirement savings or remortgaging your home to invest a lump sum.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:07:54
Same here, but it may be better to be a 'saver' in a mildly inflationary economy.  You can actually do it quicker because your wealth is coming from people wasting theirs.
If you buy a share of prada, for example, if people are taking out credit card debt to buy a bag, you are directly benefiting from it.  Same is true if you have a whole market ETF or index fund, it's just spread out over a large number of companies.
This is the core reason for the widening wealth gap, your rich people have more money to invest, more than they have any interest on spending on consumables, which means greater returns.

Personally, I don't have any problem with somebody who buys a ticket, especially if something like the payout is huge or something.  
But usually what I see instead is somebody checking twenty or thirty tickets who clearly can't afford that much lost.  I would feel smug if I didn't feel so sad.
