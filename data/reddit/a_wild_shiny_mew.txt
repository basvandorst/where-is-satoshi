When is bitcoin no longer a work in progress? It's been continuously updated with tweaks and changes for how many years now? Almost 10?
And I want my transaction to arrive as soon as possible, because why do I want to wait an extra day for my item to ship or to get my coffee or whatever, and I don't want my bitcoin to be tied up in a lightning node, because I don't have control of it.
And the network is safe and secure, the fact that it's doing better than ever is proof of it. It's survived insurmountable odds to be at its current position as the defacto cryptocurrency.

What happens if I didn't buy bitcoin, but still got some from nicehash? Sold it at market rate. Could I count my electricity bill as the purchase price, since it technically was, since I mined it?

So we should base it on miners signaling, and not on Twitter or nodes.

Wait, I thought that that's exactly how you're supposed to calculate the "will of the community"


If it's not bits in the blocks, then what else would it be? Certainly not IP's or number of accounts subscribed to a forum.
