Coinbase hits you with 4% for credit/debit card transaction. It's understandable considering merchants pay 3-4% to the credit card companies for processing. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:38:20
Some people can get an introductory 0% APR offer for a period of 12-18 months. Makes sense if you're disciplined enough to carry that debt.

Nodes are computers that people run bitcoin software on, these computers verify transactions. Multiple computers verify the same transaction.

Mining creates bitcoins for you, running a node helps  confirm transactions. The faster transactions are confirmed, the better bitcoin is working. Not everyone needs to run a node, or mine for that matter.

China is a different level, study the Cultural Revolution and discover what the Chinese psyche is like today. Ruthless backstabbing and hysterical blame shifting were what it took to survive the Cultural Revolution. It's still a large part of the Chinese mentality. If I can deceive you, you're too stupid to see my intentions and deserve to be deceived.

Many do however, I think there are way more than 9,000 people in the US that can handle running a full node. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:07:51
Can people who run nodes do anything?
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:14:34
I have no idea what's going on.

Banks charge for wires. Are you talking about Venmo? That's a platform PayPal owns that they offer for free to expand its usage. Eventually merchants will accept Venmo and they will make fees from that transaction.

Businesses pay anywhere from 2-6 % processing fees when accepting credit/debit cards.

.6% for sending money? May be pretty high for idealists but that's the cheapest I've ever seen money be sent. I've sent money overseas, I've processed credit cards as a merchant- this is very low.
