You've been reported as spam for the following reason:
* **If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way**, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to peoples questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer.

From: "SAMULL BAYO" &lt;samull_1
Subject: URGENT REPLY NEEDED.
 
FROM THE DESK OF: MR SAMULL BAYO.
BANK OF AFRICA, ABUJA, NIGERIA.
 
I am Mr samull bayo Foreign Remmitance Director of BANK Africa.
This is a very confidential proposition for you. On October 21st 2013, a Bitcoin consultant/contractor with the  Solid Currency Corporation, Mr.Mauricio Jose De Matos made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for 38300 Bitcoins, valued at US$8,000,000.00 (Eight Million Dollars only) in my branch.
Upon maturity on October 20th 2013 as his Credit Officer, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally i discovered from his contract employers, that Mr.Mauricio Jose De Matos died on an Air Crash.
Further investigations,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. Again,I made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Matos did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.
This sum of US$8,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank  No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the International Banking ethics,codes and Laws, at the expiration of 2(Two) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigeria Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Mauricio Jose De Matos. This is simple, I will like you to respond immediately with your full names and address so that we will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and some of my colleagues who are aware of this transaction and 25% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by my colleagues and with my position as the Foreign Remmitance Director guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. You should observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply.
Thanks and regards.
Samull Bayo
