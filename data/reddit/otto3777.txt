Site is offline atm. Here the twitter feed:
We're investigating some site reliability issues at the moment. We'll keep updating here as we have updates. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Kraken is working here.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:28:51
Kraken are from the USA, but they work with the Fidor Bank (Munich,Germany).
I think its the leading exchanger about Euro.
You can also have a look at bitcoin.de , but this is a marketplace, so you trade with other people.

How can I pre-generate new addresses?
Electrum will generate new addresses as you use them, but if you wish to pre-generate new addresses, you can do so with by typing wallet.create_new_address() into the console. This will generate one new address. If you wish to generate more than one, you will need to make a loop. For example, if you wanted to generate 50 addresses, you could do this:
for x in range(0, 50):
    print wallet.create_new_address()
WARNING: addresses beyond the gap limit will not be recovered from seed!

As far as I know it works with the last version of Bitcoin QT.
(!!But do a backup of your wallet.dat before you try it.!!)
To sell it I would use 
bitstamp.net for USD or 
Kraken.com for Euro.

News from Twitter:   DDoS attack
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:26:25
So far I know the only risk is, that the can check your emails.
But If you bougth the Blockchain app at the AppStore, you wont loose it. 
Only if you used Jailbreak, you will lose that.
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:50:26
can confirm that.
Also get that error.
Statment from Twitter:
The website is offline temporarily while we investigate an apparent hardware failure. Nothing to be concerned about.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:25:17

there are some offers at paxful.com but the exchange rates are bad.

Only coins in wallets you have the private key are really your‘s
@_date: 2015-07-10 10:34:10
I think its because it was mined 46s after the block before. And so its hard for miner to collect new transactions in that short time.
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:01:40
Yea. Seams so
@_date: 2016-02-14 13:51:03
I think the best way is use an API,
like the blockchain.info
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:22:21
You can just wait. At the moment the mempool is very full.
