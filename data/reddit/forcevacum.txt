I can't figure out why it's happening this weekend. Traders seem to have a lot of money in exchanged held in fiat which they already would have had since friday. It's not like banks anywhere are open for another 9 hours. If they are strategic investors how come they aren't waiting for sellers to get time to mobilise their sales from cold storage? This run-up spells frenzy because it's too quick.

Great post. I've been saying this for a while but here goes- Bitcoin can't be the panacea for everything, nothing can have ultimate scalability, be distributed in nature and also cost nothing. 
The most important use case for Bitcoin right now is, for example, the elderly second world worker who has saved 10,000 dollars over his lifetime for his families pension to live out the rest of their days. We cannot let a corrupt government wipe 40% of his value away on a whim. Bitcoin lets him prevent this when our endgame is actualised. 
When you compare this man's future livelihood, to some keyboard warrior neckbeards being very vocal that it's taking too much time for confirmations when they buy a 5 dollar frappo-latte you really get a sense how people don't understand the real potential that bitcoin has to improve the lives of people.
When a man's livelihood is at stake he's willing to spend a little bit more to know his transaction is intact, bitcoin only has to beat the *current systems* slightly to win.That man only needs one transaction to save his wealth, he doen't really care if it takes three days to settle the transaction. Bitcoin already beats the shit out of western union fees on a percentage basis and beats the shit out of tradition bank transfers in transaction time.

Yes. 
It's impossible to determine how many people don't have access to their private keys, or if they are in storage so it's calculated on total number of coins in existance.

About two years ago I sold three bitcoin to some enthusiastic newbie for 180 euro on localbitcoins for cash, within 6 hours the price had crashed to quarter of that. The moral of my story is that even that he probably felt burned at the time, it's still unbelievable value at today's rates. Just wait a few years.

Personally, I think an extra settlement layer will be built on Bitcoin. I think its more important to have bitcoin as a store of value though so I don't focus on the in's and out's of other coins. If you are a poor farmer in Venezuela and you have 10,000 dollars saved which is supposed to let you live out your live as you get older and then you wake up to watch 40% of that value wiped out, you can understand how much more important a store of value is compared to whatever method you use to buy a 5 dollar Starbucks with.

I don't think you can read the superficialities at face value. If you are capable of designing bitcoin, it doesn't take much to make the code seem like it came from an intermediate level programmer, it's not too hard to make the author seem vaguely British and its in the spirit of making the project seem to be against the traditional systems.

Some of us are here because we want to have control of our money outside the hours of 9-5 and start transactions that take minutes, not days.

Greg, with all due respect, for years we've been telling noobs to go with bitaddress as the defacto offline storage option. I'm a moderate to advanced technical user but only now i'm being told that the crypto might not be that strong?
