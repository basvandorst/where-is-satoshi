It's not even about fees, it's the fact that it's still centralized and they're still following KYC and AML laws and it defeats the entire purpose of being a decentralized, anonymous, global currency.

Except that you can go places and buy things with crypto. You can't buy things with company shares.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:20:02
But a bank acting as a singular, centralized exchange is the exact opposite of the purpose of cryptocurrency.
That just makes it a regular currency that will still be subject to all the pains with our current cash system, and anyone who thinks it's **actually** good for crypto doesn't understand it.
And the fact that that's the biggest topic today (and all the comments celebrating it) just shows the majority of the sub are just here for crypto as an investment.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:35:12
I mean, all exchanges are centralized.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:53:04


What? Yes they can. There very nature of using an exchange is exactly that.
"OK, give us your name, address, and government ID. Ok, now can you can buy crypto through us, and we're going to track all exchanges just like we do with our fiat currency"

It's terrible news.
If you're dealing with a centralized bank now it's not CRYPTOcurrency, it's just currency. This is exactly no different than just using a debit or credit card.
You're going through a singular, centralized entity responsible for vetting and monitoring all traffic. It's not anonymous, it's not decentralized. It'll be controlled, regulated, and scrutinized just like fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:55:36
Exactly. Anyone who is excited about this doesn't understand the purpose of crypto currency, or does but is only in it as an investment.
If you're going through a bank (or any exchange) then it's not anonymous, it's not decentralized, and it's not open, it's not CRYPTOcurrency, it's just currency.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:09:52
It's literally the exact opposite of the purpose of crypto lol.
Explain why one should use this magic internet money if it still needs to go through banks like regular money.
The beauty of it was that could send money to anyone, anywhere, almost instantly. Now with a bank you can still only send it to approved entities (other people "okayed" by banks) where they choose to operate.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:37:31
Because most people are just here because they treat crypto as an investment rather than a movement away from banks. So if a bank is getting involved it's legitimizing it to some degree (acknowledging it) and they can say to their friends, "See it's not a scam, banks even use it!"

And will overheat if you try to really do much with it. An AMG will happily take a beating.
If you just want something quick and cool, yeah Tesla's are great. If you want an actual driver's car... Absolutely not.

Mine range from 3-8% ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:22:08
Assuming new cars only...
$25K - Focus ST / GTI
$35K - Focus RS / Golf R
$45K - A well-optioned V8 Camaro
$55K - M2?
No idea what I'd want above and beyond that. Other M cars until I could afford a good 911, I guess.

It's impossible to say, but given that it has climbed an insane amount this week I personally feel like a dip is coming.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:13:49
Hardly. I didn't until someone posted a thread about him last week. My coworker who has been into crypto for about half a year now never heard of him either.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:04
Newcomer to Bitcoin, got in at 7K. Just sold half of what I bought to recoup my initial expenditure... And then an hour after I did that it climbed from 16 all the way up to 19 lol.
Gonna let the rest ride for as long as I dare.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:29:43
But then you can't get that precious, precious link karma!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:59:04
I didn't wake up *to* check the price. But I did wake up so I definitely checked.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:37
It seems to have finally calmed the fuck down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:29:48
... I'd rather the AMG lol. Veyron is fuck ugly. Chiron is an improvement but I'm still not a fan
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:12:03
Merc/AMG does make some incredible sounding cars. I do like their newest generation design, but I've never been a fan of anything before.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:01:14
He is pretty intrigued by those crypto kitties...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:58
Talking to my coworker at the end of the day: "$13K!! Sell your house and children, buy Bitcoin!!"
Me waking up this morning: "15K what the fuck"
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:25:00
Feels like just the other day
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:43
I get your point, but if you're not into cars then you'll just never understand.
For you, a car might just be a means to get you to work or the grocery store. To people who are into cars, who enjoy driving, there is a day and night difference between a Civic and something like an AMG.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:22:55
This is my coworker buying and selling one crypto in order to buy a different kind every other week

~2.8 Bitcoin would free me the student loans I've still got 5 years left on :/
That's all I want lol.

People having an actual conversation about it from someone they probably trust and convincing them to buy in -- after being shown how -- is one thing.
A TV show which appeals to people like my parents who can't even send an email when their ISP changes the layout of their email website aren't going to buy in. Obviously not all of their viewers are as inept as my parents, but I seriously don't think it's going to do much of anything.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:08:50
Yea but I actually want to drive there Roadster. I don't want to drive a Civic.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:29:26
This is one of the things I really like; I get 1% back with my Amazon card. Not a huge amount, but it's better than nothing like if I used somewhere which only allows debit/actual bank account details.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:38:36
Once the new Roadster is out, maybe it will.

Everything is always at risk if it's not your wallet.

One who makes more than 1% of your transaction's value in processing fees and therefore not operating at a loss
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:13:51
My issue is that one entity (banks) treat it as a cash advance. Then another entity (gov) treats crypto as a asset/stock.
So is it an asset or is it currency? Can't treat it as both.
