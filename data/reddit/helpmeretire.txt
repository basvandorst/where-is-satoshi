If I sell on December 31st and buy right back that would fall under "Wash Sale". I need to at-least 30 days gap between selling and re-buying.

Well, I was able to signup using the invite on Circle and got $10 worth BTC. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:29:33
I have no other captial gains, so I'll take my $3K this year. I bought everything from Coinbase, so I got my documents. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:20:09
I thought in stocks you can only claim $3,000 losses per year. Is that same for Bitcoin? I guess I'll have to carry forward my losses over two years. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:30:35
Good Luck!!

I'm also interested, mind sharing the channel?
@_date: 2014-09-25 04:31:38


Yes I do.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:18:52
Bought first Coin at $1050 and averaged it down to $690. Now just want to cut my losses and get out by December. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:30:19
Will sell enough to claim $3K in losses.

Sorry can't spare any bitcoins but here have a downvote.

I just imported my Cryptsy based transactions and looks like it is reporting all my AltCoin trades back to BTC have 0 cost basis. So all those trades are showing up as 100% gain.  Anyone else had this problem? @_date: 2016-03-17 20:38:32

Thanks for your reply. The bitcoins were purchased from coinbase and then transfered to Cryptsy. How can I add cost basis for them, it is not letting me edit the imported data.

It took 3 days for price to go up $100 but only took ~3 hours to drop the same amount. This is Bitcoin ladies and gentlemen.

Yahoo Finance shows 1 year target of $61/share. That means they value BTC at $610/BTC.

Bought my 1st Bitcoin in 2013..was down about 50% in 2014-2015 and part of 2016.. Currently down about 5%. So this 83% return does not work for everyone.. I did do DCA in 2014-2015 but it was enough, i brought by average down from 900 to 670.

On the same note looks like Stock market will go rally if UK does stay in EuroZone.

All 3 wallets were created using same passphrase. Now if I import wallet 1 &amp; 2 to a electronic wallet, at that point my passphrase is exposed to the internet. 
Would it still be safe to move my funds to 3rd wallet whose passphrase has been exposed to the net?

@_date: 2016-02-18 22:19:25
I have had this issue in the past. If I'm buying $100 worth Bitcoin, then CoinBase includes their 1% fees on top of the order which it pushes my total to $101. This makes my order go from Instant to 5 days wait.

If you are asking $1MM/Per BTC, I don't think if it will ever reach that. If you are asking from $1,00,000/200 BTC = $5,000/Per BTC, then I think that can be achieved by 2020.

You are only counting investors buying to increase holdings. What about remitting money overseas, buying btc to buy things on online, paying bills via btc, funds like GBTC or COIN buying btc to give more shares. Thoughts?

Global Remittance is about $700 Billion a year. If BTC picks up 1% of that it is $7 Billion dollar of Bitcoins that needs to be purchased. I understand that people will convert that to fiat but then again it is a repeating cycle and people will buy BTC again to transfer funds. And if BTC price stabilize then more people will be holding than converting to fiat.
