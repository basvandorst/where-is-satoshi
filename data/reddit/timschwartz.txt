What are they being charged with? I read the article but couldn't figure it out.
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:43:47
I don't understand, I thought there had to be evidence of a crime to subpoena something.
Isn't this just "fishing"?
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:29:27


Yes, yes it does.
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:36:06


Except they do stuff like this all the time. They just didn't notice the app until now.


What a bunch of hyperbole. Like you can't just go to a web wallet using safari.
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:09:32


No one said that.
He said:

How are they not altcoins?
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:20:27


That doesn't change the fact that I don't know who Theymos is.
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:36:43


@_date: 2016-01-15 07:10:56


? I don't even know who that is.

Of course, anyone who dares to disagree with your opinion *must* be a "shill".

Yes, I remember Gnutella. It's still in use today as Limewire Pirate Edition.
What were you saying about it "keeling over"?
@_date: 2012-01-17 18:38:33
possible, but completely pointless
@_date: 2012-01-10 21:32:54
Yes, "if". 
Also "if" they make no improvements to bitcoin in the future, which seems unlikely
 I feel like you are trying to cross a bridge miles before we get to it.

there is absolutely nothing to prevent you from becoming a supernode too.
@_date: 2012-01-10 19:17:13
how exactly is it a "failure" if it's still in use eleven years after that paper said it would fail?
@_date: 2012-10-24 02:55:43
I've used it several times.
@_date: 2012-01-02 07:08:44

how is bitcoin unhackable? wallet.dat is just as vulnerable as any  other file on your hard drive.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:57:31
Sigh. I can't help but think back to when I had dozens of them at $3. I spent them on amazon gift cards.
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:20:39
It's not defamation if it's true.
@_date: 2011-07-18 19:42:32


I think so.
 
* Setup a Dwolla account
* wait a week for bank verification
* wait several days more for the money to transfer from your bank account )
* then finally transfer money to your exchange of choice.
The average person is going to take one look at this procedure and think "I can't just buy them instantly with my bank card? This is stupid".
I can't see how bitcoin will catch on this way :/

cypress is it

I guess we've fallen a long way since Abraham Lincoln walked three miles to return 6 cents.
@_date: 2011-06-27 18:35:39
Except that it does.
Just because the server isn't called 'mail.mtgox.com' doesn't mean anything.
@_date: 2011-08-07 00:55:54


So why respond?
@_date: 2011-09-03 07:35:58
If you have to ask if some is a scam, then it's a scam.
@_date: 2011-06-27 18:56:59
Also, there is nothing that stops any mail server from claiming to be mail.mtgox.com when it sends mail. So even if you were looking for it you could be fooled.
@_date: 2011-06-20 17:54:53


@_date: 2011-05-19 04:48:58
There is no way to pay with a debit card. 
I'd have to send cash/check or buy some intermediate currency and switch to that. 
Not interested.

I got the same password reset email the other day. I haven't changed my password, but I did lock my wallet addresses.
Did they lock the addresses after they changed them? if not, fix and lock them now. if they did lock them, you'll have to make yourself a new acoount.
@_date: 2011-06-27 18:02:30
Why bother to do anything about it if there's no money in the account?
@_date: 2011-07-26 21:11:25
@_date: 2011-06-27 18:04:38


By definition if it's the real mailserver then it is not bogus.
@_date: 2011-09-27 15:02:07
Because it's not a problem with the currency. 


Then obviously bitcoins aren't ready to be valued so high.
@_date: 2011-06-12 03:03:32
For what?
@_date: 2011-06-27 18:54:24
Yes, that is how email works. 
That is how email has always worked.
@_date: 2011-11-02 06:38:52
I hope you are already looking for alternatives.

Demand keeps increasing while supply stays the same. Relative to demand supply DOES decrease.
@_date: 2011-10-24 17:49:31
The article says nothing about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-25 02:12:25
@_date: 2011-07-27 20:28:44
Yes, after the transaction was reversed from Dwolla back to the original bank.
@_date: 2011-10-19 14:18:41
you aren't missing anything.
~~Everyone's~~ A lot of people are just mad that their "investments" aren't making them quick cash.
@_date: 2011-06-16 19:36:47


Nope, I still don't know what they mean by that.
@_date: 2011-12-19 14:47:47


People need to be constantly reminded of this. 
@_date: 2011-07-27 20:30:16


eh, I'm sure it's just pure greed with not a care for bitcoin itself
@_date: 2011-10-19 04:38:31


which is a bad thing

I guess he shouldn't have been a piece of shit thief.
@_date: 2011-05-18 22:17:31
Mind if I ask how much you made in a month?
@_date: 2011-06-15 21:00:20
But the demand keeps increasing. Relative to demand supply lessens.

Great, I just have to transfer money from my bank to dwolla then from dwolla to mtgox and I can be buying btc in a week. 
At which point the price will have gone up again :/

@_date: 2011-06-27 18:20:06
If it delivers mail then it is a real mail server.
@_date: 2011-06-15 17:17:39
More difficult mining means less supply and greater demand.
@_date: 2011-05-19 14:52:19
ok, how much should I send and where should I send it?
but..is there really no way to just buy coins with a debit card without having to go through paypal or anything else?
@_date: 2011-06-19 05:22:43
The guy who lost 25,000btc might disagree with you.
@_date: 2011-06-15 17:19:34
Yup, more difficult mining == less supply.
Even if demand doesn't increase, but stays exactly the same the price will go up to compensate.

You can reverse ACH charges up to 60 days later, who is going to wait that long?
