I was gpu mining in 2009... Was just something to tinker with, wish I stuck with it.

I woke up and saw it hit $11k and I doubled down. Glad I just caught it.

It's not an easy task, but at some point they're going to spend it or deposit into a bank, no? I guess they could just hold it forever, but if you don't think there's someone out there databasing every transaction already....

No really, that's exactly the type of thing computational mathmatics excels at...aka computers.

Why not? You telling me for that many millions you can't write some software to track every transaction that originated from those addresses? Seems pretty easy to me, but that's why I'm asking, I must be missing something obvious.

So this is the part I'm missing. People pool their bitcoins into a single wallet? I always just assumed everyone had their own address. It's not tied to personally identifiable info obviously, but I was under the assumption that btc was all about decentralizing currency. Thanks for the explanation.
 So how does the bank or pool keep track of which person owns what if they are all in the same wallet? Guess I have some googling to do.

Still a noob (and I mined coins in 2010)...but since every transaction is in the blockchain, can't you just keep track of all the transactions and follow the money. Eventually someone is going to spend money or transfer to a known address and then you start following the meat bag trail from there. Its obviously not easy/almost impossible to follow the meat bag trail...is that essentially the issue?
