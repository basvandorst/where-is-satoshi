I recently had this,  almost 24 hrs with zero confirmations. They recently confirmed.
Just be patient, check your fees, although that should self adjust depending on the wallet you use.

The only problem you face then is that you are stuck with fiat in a foreign country. You could do it the other way around. But then you have 10000usd political border crossing limit...

This sounds more like global collectivist, this sick tendency to socialism and the total state.

This crap is borderline scam. WTF? You can withdraw crypto? It should be announced on the buy options. Also never get into Skrill physical card, they will ask for verification and after seeing and "verifying your ID" they will send you a MasterCard that only works for EU residents even though the IDs you provide to them are clearly not EU residents... they will happily charge for a piece of plastic that will not work for you.
