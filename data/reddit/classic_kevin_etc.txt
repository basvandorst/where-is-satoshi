This is a totally separate project by IOHK. That is definitely **not** the message here.

This is a separate project! Why is that so hard to understand? It has been in development for \~2 years with a separate team that has nothing to do with Cardano development. Symphony 1.0 was released a over a year ago. Where was your outrage then? Your assumption is absolutely ridiculous. Companies can walk and chew gum at the same time. smdh 
p.s. this is r/bitcoin **not** r/cardano **nor** is it r/cryptocurrency

Make sure to follow the project on the official [Symphony Twitter]( account. You can also find the team info, project motivation and description  [here.](

It’s really something to behold, a first and only of its kind.

Thanks! Symphony is operational on almost any internet-connected device (barring flip-phones). We hope to soon incorporate WebVR for exploration in virtual reality at home!

Wrong subreddit. Also, Symphony is a separate project from IOHK, which is a crypto-agnostic R&amp;D company.

By the way, the cluster on the right is the mempool in realtime, the structures that look like trees are, what else, the Merkle trees. Directly above those is the actual block with each transaction on top of that.
