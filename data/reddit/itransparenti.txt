transactions needs money to run, miners earns btc for that.
Pivate tracker torrent needs money to run, they have a community...

If you have BTC and you want to send BTC, ok it's far more cheaper than Paypal. But (the purpose of my question) if you want to buy or sell BTC with USD or Euros, it's a nightmare and it's a lot more expensive than taking your money from Paypal and if trader can't do that, BTC can still be useful for some transaction but I hope it will not become the Esperanto of currency
Ok I hope that BTC will not become the Esperanto's currency

Yes exactly, this is simple and perfect. I wish something like that can be create on internet, of course this market will need some resources (money) but i'm sure the community is enough smart to change the usual bank scheme and pay only what we ask for (like a BTC transaction).
And yes maybe when BTC will be for every day life this question will be irrelevant because why we will need USD for?!

No but BTC is a joke? If a BTC's value are not the same from different exchange place because of fees stoop saying that BTC allow us to avoid the fee from the bad bank because mt gox is the bank in this sytem!!! It's more easy rapid and with less fee to transfer euro.. (and i think same for dollar...) So at the end you have more problem with BTC than with Dollar :/

Maybe you need a draw?
Transactions BTC - Need - Computer - Need hardware - Need electricty - Need money to pay electricity - Miners procure that - Earn fee for that. Do you understand?
So no a "free" market place can exist with a split of all the fee within the community and not with a bank who makes money on that.
But be an asshole, don't try to think or understand someone doesn't speak your language perfectly

'Mining' is somewhat of a misnomer, as it would more adequately be called 'Transaction Validating'. Miners validate the transactions and keep the blockchain untouchable to would-be attackers. Producing coins is merely a byproduct of the incredibly important process of maintaining the blockchain, which is the backbone of bitcoin. you understand me?

haha no miners are not paid only for mining do you understand BTC? :/ 
Because the transactions need a lot of work, and BTC doesn't need money to do that because miner are the one helping for that did you ever ask this question?
So please let someone maybe with a better understanding answer my question. I know that it is easier to do so like the previous scheme with bank but BTC is not here to change all of this? to ask question? I think that i understand economy pretty well so stop being an asshole because you think there is no other solution.

So why it is impossible to think about a similar system in order to encourage the trader to use BTC? ( because at the end sadly for now trader wants to have USD  to pay the bill etc.).
I understand that company like Mt Gox wants to make money with this new currency and maybe we can try to make something better, it was just an idea, sorry to make a post about it but it was just a question... I don't want to buy or sell BTC in 5 years with my usual bank.
