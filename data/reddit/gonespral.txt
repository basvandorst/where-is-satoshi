Yeah just wait for the price to slightly drop. Then everybody will be criticising bitcoin...

All I'm saying is bitcoin is very volatile because people don't completely trust it yet, and their view on bitcoin changes very easily based on the price - the market is very emotional 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:21:51
I prefer soft spoons
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:30:20
No idea

I'm pretty sure Kraken allows trading of the coins if that's what you're looking for
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:14:51
People dumping the BCH they claimed after the chain split, and buying bitcoin using that money
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:21:37
Don't do it
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:09:16
Not hold, you mean hodl
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:18:09
I'm getting the same thing - all the alarms I set on coinbase are going off
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:01:16
You haven't cleared your downloads since 2011?
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:04:09
I thought that was USD for a moment
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:37:04
Yh because the trading happens off the Blockchain right?
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:17:11
That is not crashing.. it's just a temporary pullback

@_date: 2017-08-05 14:03:15
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:50:51
Why bro
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:36:02
Go to Blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:21:40
The price fluctuates over time... The question isn't WHERE to buy it, it's WHEN to buy it. That's for you to decide, but just remember to never take any advice anybody gives you on your trades too seriously. Use it to compare it to what the crowd is doing to estimate what the price will do.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:18:55
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:32:25
That's an expensive drive

@_date: 2017-08-05 18:48:34
Maybe... I was hoping someone would reply that for me :(
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:15:29
Then when do you sell
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:35:55
I mean why in the world would you buy bcash. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:18:29
I've got 50 bucks 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:22:03
Im laughing so hard
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:50:48
Why bro
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:30:59
Think so... The next block in the chain
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:50:59
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:06:15
Yeah nobody really has any idea of what might happen
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:36:55
I've got a bad feeling about this
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:23:12
Never sell
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:09:43
Yes but if you don't control your keys you don't have direct access to your bitcoin and you can't touch them without having permission from the exchange or online wallet
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:17:25
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:25:15
You don't sell
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:59:38
Pretty accurate
@_date: 2018-07-13 21:27:51
Is that near Puerto Banus in Marbella? I saw the same shop and took a pic but never uploaded it
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:03:46
what happens when this bubble pops?
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:00:20
good point
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:14:09
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:15:21
Anybody agree there's a new point of resistance at €2,000?
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:12:11
thats one way to call it
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:04:36
looks like thats the case so far...
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:23:25

@_date: 2017-05-28 17:49:05

@_date: 2017-05-28 18:00:12

@_date: 2017-05-28 17:29:36

anybody? anybody?
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:38:23
I do exactly the same thing except I only made a few bucks from that huge spike... I sold out too early because I wasn't expecting it to go this high.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:39:19
Did you seriously ��
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:16:38
im watching the price right now and it looks like it doesnt want to go over 2000 - it keeps bouncing off
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:32:12
That sparks my interest
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:37:43
Oh shit
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:54:57
Havent set up port forwarding yet... Ill do that and see what happens
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:43:58

@_date: 2017-06-06 05:23:43

Im running a Bitcoin full node on my raspberry pi with a 500 GB drive. I connected a 16x2 LCD to it and wrote a python script to display the current number of blocks downloaded (its taking forever to synchronize with the rest of the network)
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:57:57
ok, thanks for the help!
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:59:55

@_date: 2017-06-03 12:53:01
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:02:32
wow indeed indeed
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:53:32
It'll probably be a while until it finishes anyway...
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:52:23
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:01:55
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:23:33
i see how you reached this conclusion
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:59:59
this is so good
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:52:41
- Running Raspbian Jessie headless
- I stopped all other unnecessary services to make sure only the bitcoin daemon is running
- It's also running 24/7 without any interruptions
Also, I haven't modified the settings... Should I? What settings will improve my download speed?
