Neighbour got to keep his house and boat during his bankruptcy. Why not borrow as much as you can, declare bankruptcy, and stack sats for 7 years? The halvening is coming up too...

Oh good lord no! I would *never* trust government with my welfare. Even on my own, they, my bank and credit agency lost my identity, everything was frozen for a couple weeks. Their incompetence knows no bounds.

You. I like you.
Run it unblocked as long as you can. Spoof your MAC to something funny. Change it once they block you then use a VPN for the 'comeback kid' effect. Document anonymously so you can post proof for the comeback. Voilà.
You can always get a real job after, if you even need one by then.

Yup, wirex is a failure, they said they were going to, now it's just infinitely delayed. Above is the only legacy payment interface for Canucks, far as I know.

That's what sharding is meant to address.

That's the original idiom from the intelligence community. Bitcoin flips it on its head, because it's finally a truly trustless system.

Ah, that explains why i can't buy coin anymore (was able to in march). 
They're getting in the game themselves and want to gatekeep.
I wanted to switch to the local credit union anyway...thanks TD!

Transition to native segwit: Create wallet, transfer balance.
I imagine it would be similar.

"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

Who cares? We all win so long as we're hip to the market. Competition is *good*.
Hats off to whoever can solve the trade-off issues, if that's even possible. That's why i'm a layers guy. BTC w/lightning layer and ETH sugar on top. If ETH 2.0 does it all, why not switch? Also, none if these are exclusive. One size fits all solutions are old people think, like centralization/silo-ing.

Dear Brad,
As a Canadian who's dollar has to be 75% of USD, this is what you get for snapping the metre stick to spread the ends wider (worsening inequality). The rest of us were using that!
Now there are immutable ledgers running. Oh hai.

Yeah, my bank's trading division is working on doing a USD backed shitcoin (I suspect so they can launder money internally to overseas, vice versa), so magically I can't buy genuine btc anymore, what a coincidence eh?
Needed to switch to a credit union for fiat anyway. I'm paying the monthly, I should be able to spend my money how I please, like saving it in a non-quantitiative eased depriciated currency.
