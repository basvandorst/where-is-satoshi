Right up until the system takes your money and gives you nothing. DO a quick history on robocoin, the company used and thrown that became romit, and the CEO who ran both into the ground. 90% of it is on reddit.

The one on the strip is also breaking down. It 'crashes' after taking your money, and again you have to call some guy to come down and meet you to get it back. The software and the network is very broken, and they are giving up on the ATMs anyway. Probably not supporting them anymore. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:39:25
No kidding. Their whole network crashed last night, and they are calling it a 'maintenance event'. I sat there for two hours watching it crash and restart while talking to the support guy via email.

Related. The shell company that runs that kiosk sent out a txt message to all users saying it will be down for a few weeks. Usually it's just out of money - but you can never tell and it will sell your BTC anyway and not give you your money. Had to call the dude twice to get my money back. Beware!
@_date: 2015-01-30 10:58:29
What's worse is now they are failing to pay out. Twice I sold bitcoin and got no cash. I've heard people talking about putting cash in and then the thing crashes and does not give them any bitcoin. They seem to be running out of money to operate and this is their way of getting some back.

Step 1 : don't bother with robocoin
Step 2 : profit!
With robocoin the only winning move is not to play. The operators get that , and they are your best allies trying to get your money back from the rob-o-coin. Soon they will dump them and get working BTMs and all will be well.

Looks like people may be catching on to the rob-o-coin way of business. Keep re-inventing, keep taking money, and keep moving. It's only a matter of time before the software crashes , the service stops and " it's not our fault ... we now know that we can better serve you by ... em .. er .... Robostarter!

@_date: 2015-02-03 10:29:13
No, not at all. They got rid of their support ' team ' and no one is answering support email anymore. The best you can do is find the person who operates the ATM and ask them. From what I've heard on reddit they are going to dump the ATMs anyway and so something else. I'd run away. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:55:56
It's not just one 'keyboard warrior' though to be honest that's what I thought at first myself. I totally thought it was a troll in the woods. Then I started asking around and meeting people in person and getting first hand accounts of people being ripped off, left holding the bag, and a trail of lies told by Jordan. I did more than just search reddit, I searched google, did legal filing searches , and talked to multiple operators ( I was looking to buy 2 robocoin kiosks and I'm glad that I didn't ) , and a few customers like myself who had their money eaten. Looking at the history of the company you can see how untrustworthy and slimy they are. You make a good point, and no one should just instantly believe one post by one keyboard warrior. Spend the time to do real research and talk to people both in person and by email and look at all of the angry , frustrated people out there who have been taken advantage of by this 'company'. It's not hard. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:19:34
Their system has been crashing left and right lately and taking people's money. Last week I tried to but some bitcoin and it took my money then crashed and rebooted. I had to call around to find someone to get my money back. Get your coins out of there as soon as you can. If you talk to them don't let them tell you it's a internet problem or some kind of temporary problem. Demand to talk to the person who can get you your money back.

After being ripped off at the robocoin atm ( took money, crashed, no bitcoin given ) I found out that good 'ol Jordan is not only lying to investors, operators, and employees but also to vendors. He has a reputation a mile wide for scamming people or not paying them. It would not surprise me at all if he was also lying about the entire system and about the 'compliance' changes that are being made. After I was ripped off I talked to two operators, and one of the locations where they have an ATM and the story seems the same. Most recently I heard they got rid of their entire support department. I bet if we could get a hold of a former employee we could get some real answers. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:58:25
That's what they tell you. They told me the same thing. It's been going on for a while. The guy behind the counter told me that some people have been selling bitcoin and getting no cash too. Now the one at the D in las vegas is shut down. Just sitting there all powered off and sad. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 14:20:48
Because people are not speaking up loud enough. A lot of folks don't know what he has pulled , including ATMIA where he is supposed to be speaking this week. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:37:10
I asked the owner ( or the guy the owner sent out ) when I lost my money in the ATM. He told me that the ATM doesn't care how much money is in the thing when you sell bitcoin. If it doesn't have enough cash in it to cover your sale it just gives a hardware error and sends an email to the owner. I didn't believe him at first because what kind of fool would program an ATM that way? He assured me that he had to do hand payouts multiple times. What happened to me was I put money in to buy bitcoin and the ATM crashed before it credited my wallet. The guy told me there were no records he could access and that he had to email robocoin to get 'proof' that I had put money in. Never again. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:18:42

Yes , draw your own conclusions. Do a reddit search for robocoin and see how other partners have fared over time. Talk to Alex Peterson , and other early adopters and see how they were treated. Do a little legal action search and see the lawsuits that are out there. Talk to the people who used the 'service' and their missing money and lost transactions (like mine ... still no word on my $500 ).
Yeah, draw your own conclusions.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:04:48
Sounds about right. Out of the two ATMs in Vegas one is shut off and just sitting there dead, the other one on the strip has been ripping people off. I talked to the guy behind the counter and he told me that people are putting money in and then it crashes, or they sell their bitcoin and no money comes out. He said that the guy who runs it has been in and out of the store constantly meeting with people to refund them. He gave me some info to talk to a guy about it. From what I've read on reddit they are getting rid of the kiosks because their software keep crashing and burning people and they can't keep them working. Another web site I read a rumor that they are letting people go from the company. Have you heard anything about that ?

In case anyone missed the latest fun and games, robocoin just shafted the company they hired to do pen testing of their 'system' , telling them that " we will pay you when our VC money comes in ". Needless to say the company is not pleased. This makes 6 companies that have not been paid by robocoin. Still want to trust them with your BTC?

Hey robogat3 check this out. I went back to the ATM on the LV strip to try and buy some BTC with my superbowl winnings. Same thing again! Put money in the thing and it crashed! Took my money and I got no bitcoin. I was so pissed that I didn't bother calling or emailing anyone I just talked to the guy behind the counter at the gift store. He gave me a phone number to a person who he assured would help me. So I call this guy and ask for robocoin support and he starts laughing at me! He asked me what happened and I told him and he laughed some more. It sounded like he was in a bar. He told me I had been ripped off and I would be lucky to see any money. I told him to go fuck himself and he said "too late robocoin already fucked me". So we talked for a while and holy shit! Robocoin is really going to hell. He told me that Robocoin is ditching the kiosks completely and they are going to sell their crappy non working software to ATM vendors and try to become a money transfer company like moneygram. He also told me they know about the crashing and the money problems and they are ignoring them because they don't want to support the ATMs anymore. They are making up stories like internet failures and "API issues" to stall people off. He also told me they are out of money, but lying to people and telling them that they have signed million dollar deals while not paying vendors who have cut them off. People have been complaining to the support department but they are not getting any answers because they GOT RID OF THEIR SUPPORT DEPARTMENT which was one person trying to help people while no one was fixing the problems! I asked him why no one is complaining and he told me that most people don't know who to complain to other than the gone support "team" and the operators who are getting shafted. He invited me to a bar to talk about the whole thing and I'm going to meet him tonight. This sucks! I'd try to empty out my robocoin wallet if I thought that the ATM would give me the money and not crash. What a bunch of shit!

Absolutely. 
About 3-4 weeks ago I was ripped off by a robocoin ATM. At the time I was not the only one, but many people haggled with the operators until they got their money back. It seems that their software was crashing after accepting money and keeping the cash giving no bitcoin. A little research showed that this was rampant across their whole system. After some failed attempts to get help from them I started talking to some of the more vocal complainers here on reddit and I found a long trail of broken contracts, lies, and operators left holding the bag when the system failed and they had to make good to the customers like me for lost money. The ' 2,0 ' software was failing left and right, the kiosks were failing, and no one was doing anything about it. Fast forward and we see that the solution they came up with was to abandon the kiosks , go software only, and sell the non working software to people who provide hardware. This left the operators holding the bag ( thankfully I decided not to buy in and get the two I wanted ) with unsupported machines that didn't work. People left wondering where their money or bitcoin happens to be, and nothing but lies or no responses from robocoin directly. The more I looked into it and the more people I met the story only got worse. After talking to some people investigating the issue I found a trail of lawsuits, unpaid vendors, angry operators, and quite a bit of smoke and mirrors. 
Now we are in the current news cycle - where we are supposed to believe that the non working system being sold to hardware operators is going to be the next best thing. Looking at their history they try to do things, and when they fail they change up the game a little and pitch something new, and when that fails they change the game again. Each time leaving a trail of broken promises and ripped off people in their wake. This is CURRENT. Not the long standing ' great robocoin ripoff' story from last year. It's the current continuation of the story. The announcement of no more hardware was just made at ATMIA so saying ' doesn't sell machines directly .... anymore ' is within the current news cycle and hey, what are the people who paid anywhere from $30k to $100k going to do with their non working robocoin atms? Maybe convert them like the guys in London did?
