Wow these comments are toxic.
I'm just about to buy another 1-3 BTC for my stash. Probably around the 10K mark. I've been holding for years, and nothing has changed here.
No, people aren't moving to other cryptos because of fundamentals. They are doing it just because of price speculation. Get real.
Ripple? Lol. You were better off buying Bcash than that shit (but you really should get just Bitcoin). At least one of them isn't *completely* centralized.

Do not post your ticket number.

I love all these forks. Every time there is a forked coin, I get to sell it for more bitcoin. If I were to sell just a *fraction* of the *dividends* then I would cover my initial investment.

My grandmother cut out an article from the newspaper about CME starting Bitcoin futures. Then she mailed it to me in an envelope.

I bet someone has written one.

I'm not going to pay taxes on selling a forked coin for more bitcoin. That is ludicrous. No U.S. currency, products, or services, are involved in that.

I "seriously" don't think that people even read the fucking whitepapers of the shit they buy. Case in point: Ripple.

1BTC (now) = 1BTC (future) + 'n' number of altcoin dividends.

They have an API. You can just write an auto-buy script.

No, btc

That's right. Decentralization is key.

Honestly, it doesn't matter what "Satoshi saw as the solution". You can't build this thing just by following one dude's ideas blindly.

Yes, I'm frustrated. 
I have triple digits of BTC. I'm thinking about selling, but I really don't want to. I also don't want to wait 5+ years in case 2013 plays out again. It's stressful. 
I am positive about LN. I am positive long-term. But I would like to buy a house next year and a car next year. I'm planning a big trip out of the country, and I didn't want to make any large financial decisions right now.

My in-laws are Japanese. When I brought up the subject of Bitcoin with them this last year, they were *very* concerned - thinking I had actually lost money or was doing something reckless. Even just with "normal" investing topics, they were all asking if I ever lost money doing it (of course, but you win more than you lose). 
Anyway, I've cashed out way more than I've put into Bitcoin, so I'm just here for the ride. But my in-laws are still very concerned about me!

Will they allow individuals to lend through them if they have enough money? Or is it strictly only for institutions?

My first purchase with bitcoin was sauerkraut.
