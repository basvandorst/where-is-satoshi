It’s something to be highly concerned! 
Sources say in high places by 2020 they will have the computing power to crack the bitcoin code. 
However it’s not done yet! But it’s a project that has hundreds of millions being invested into it.

1. Is there a supporting document regarding your comment? 
 
2. So in 2018 there will be an atm for example that has the top 10 alt coins?  That customers can purchase?
Bonus: 
What would it take to integrate the top 10 alts on a atm for customers to buy? For example just like bitcoin?

I would have to agree with you

The hacker most likely contacted your phone provider! 
and had your personal information so it was easy for him to activate a phone line?
My guess 
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:29:27
I don’t Know if this is possible. 
Could the search engines ban any similar names that pose as the real exchange with a RE-direct link to simply the problem? 
It kinda sound extremely communist. However it would eradicate the problem.

When are the announcements happening?

I️ Love btc! However what no one is mentioning is CME going live and when it does btc will be shorted!!!
You ever watched the “big short” well your about to get front row tickets to the show! 
Just remember it will Eventually go back up! 
institutional money has been in the space since 2013, and don’t think they don’t have more to gain by shorting btc after a huge pump! 
I️ hope I’m Wrong however it’s the perfect storm!
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:53:55
Finally someone talking about the future reality. 
Enjoy the gains now before that tech gets released in the upcoming 2 to 3 years.

What is Podesta ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:36:14
4900 is my projection! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:23:38
Roger that thank you.
I️ was just curious why that isn’t available yet in the space. 
I️t would bring so much more adoption to the crypto market rather than BTC being the face of everything!

Question: do these atm offer alt coins?
