Those are not goals of Bitcoin, Bitcoin's goal is to provide trustless transactions between 2 parties.  The things you list are a political agenda of some of the people (and crackpots) who have latched onto Bitcoin as a way of promoting some agenda.

One chain can do everything ... and if something goes wrong you lose everything which is one reason that will not happen.  I used to think like you when I first got involved in Bitcoin but I see how the market is going. People are clearly moving towards diversity and using multiple coins/systems and I don't see anything that will change that.
Your discussion of "open protocols" and HTTP is not really applicable here.  Crypto protocols don't require hardware investments like routers and such.  all you need to do is load a piece of software.  Merchants can easily accept multiple coins if they are inclined to do so and if they use something like Bitpay it is even easier.  Shapeshifts, for example, has a business model that people will use multiple systems and different coins.  the blocksize debate and the formation of different subreddits just within Bitcoin shows that tendency for people to use different systems.  You need to give up your preconceived ideas and see what the market is actually doing.

An app is just a means to an end.  Users need a reason to use Bitcoin and if that happens then the apps will come.

Yes, trading on an exchange is supposed to be the first step to decrease volatility and make is useful for merchants.  That has not happened as fast as many people thought for a variety of reasons:
any Bitcoiners have misrepresented what Bitcoin can do which has lead to disappointment of both users and merchants and they have dropped out.  
-Many people link a fantasy political agenda to Bitcoin that is distasteful to many people and they don't want to get involved in the first place.  
-Many of the agenda people have no clue how to run a business and they often don't even consider the needs and wants of the consumers.  They think people will look at Bitcoin and agree with their whole agenda and use Bitcoin just because of that ... of course that has never materialized and it most likely never will.  -It is very difficult to mange a business that depends on private keys because those keys can be compromised by rogue employees or hackers.  
-Most Bitcoiners are against fees like the banks charge so whenever a Bitcoin company tries to charge a fee to keep their business going there is pushback (Look at Bitpay getting booed at the Philadelphia Bitcoin convention in 2012 when they mentioned their fees).  
-There is also a significant group that says people should not spend their bitcoins because the merchants will cash them in and cause the price to tank.

You seem completely clueless about all this stuff.  You obviously don't use Bitcoin that much or you know all the issues with merchant acceptance.  I have been following merchant acceptance for years and I see all the places that tried accepting Bitcoin and no longer do and very few new places signing on.  
The problems with face-to-face transactions are posted here all the time.  It is difficult to use for that purpose even if you can find someone to accept it.
The developers routinely say Bitcoin cannot be used for day-to-day transactions so it can replace fiat currencies like Greece.   The only people who deny all these issues are people who treat Bitcoin like a religion rather than a technology.  Shrem's bar stopped accepting Bitcoin long before his jail thing.  a bunch of people went in there thinking they could spend Bitcoin and after 45 minutes of discussing it with staff they gave up.  Stories like that are all over the place.  I used to live in Atlantic City area and the closest merchant accepting Bitcoin was 45 mins away.  
merchant acceptance is a huge problem that needs to be fixed.  pretending it is not a problem will not fix it.
You also don't understand the double spending issues that involve gambling sites and things like shapeshift.  You need to do some basic research.  that has been discussed at length.

yes, I never used that word in asentence before Bitcoin and I certainly never been called one before.  Now I am called a "statist" several times a week because I don't think Bitcoin will replace governments and end wars.
before I got involved in Bitcoin I heard about the Free State project and I thought it was probably a good thing to have all these people fighting for liberty.  Then I got to see them close up, what joke.  They are just totally ignorant wing nuts who sit around reinforcing themselves with ridiculous assertions.  
One of the more notable events was the first big Bitcoin conference.  free state radio covered it and they played promotional spots where they said all government were murderers.  I told other people to listen and it was a real embarrassment to hear that crap.
here is a video about the author of "The Daily Decrypt" which gives you an idea of what the Free State Project people are like:

It uses cryptography to eliminate the middle man.  However, I can't stand all the cultists who are distorting what it can do.  they are promoting a fantasy political agenda so they lie about Bitcoin when they think it will advance their agenda.  
For instance, you have to wait for the network to come to a consensus over the state of the blockchain which eliminates the possibility of it being a day-to-day currency.  That does not fit into the agenda of the cultists so they refuse to accept that fact.  then you have people like Roger Ver claiming it will end wars.  That is ridiculous.  The world is not going to switch over to Bitcoin as a the main world currency, in fact the number of currencies is going to increase, not decrease.  When cable TV cane on board the number of channels increased, not decreased.  the people who go around claiming Bitcoin will be the one and only currency refuse to accept reality which is right in front of their eyes.  Right now people are buying ETH without even understanding what it is.  There is no way Bitcoin will be the only currency and it will do nothing for inflation since new coins can be created.
I think the cultists who talk about changing society, ending wars, etc. are ruining Bitcoin and making mass adoption extremely difficult if not impossible.  People come on here, read all the false claims, then use Bitcoin themselves and find out it mostly lies, then they leave thinking Bitcoin is a big scam.

I like the way you guys say things are an "appeal to authority" when it is something you don't like.  When it is something that fits into your agenda it is a "reputation system."  lol.

In-person transactions are problematic and there have been many posted problems with that.  Many places abandoned taking Bitcoin, including the bar Charlie Shrem was involved with.  it is also obvious that some people are breaking money transmitter laws irrespective of whether they were arrested.  Bitcoin cannot be used for businesses that need instantaneous payments.  they can adapt and make people wait or use some centralized solution like the tipping company.  However, if you have to use a centralized system to make Bitcoin work then there is not much point to using Bitcoin.  People generally do not want the banking system replaced in USA/ Europe.  People want reforms to a certain extent.  Of course there will always be some wing nuts who say to replace everything (those people seem to gravitate to Bitcoin) but those people don't have any plan to replace the system.  However, that point is somewhat irrelevant to Bitcoin since Bitcoin cannot replace many banking services.  as for bankers violating laws, that is true but you get all the same sorts of things in the Bitcoin world so there is not really much of differentiation there.  
in any case promoting Bitcoin as a "replacement for banks" or expecting that to happen is not realistic at all.  There is a major problem for bitcoin banking and exchange issues where they hold your funds.  Anyone can pass a private key to anyone else and claim a mysterious "hack."  
Bitcoin has its place among many different financial instruments but I don't see it replacing anything (with a few exceptions like money transfer services).  
@_date: 2016-08-10 12:23:28
These types of articles are just rants from cultists.  Once you see something on medium.com you can be pretty confident the content is not good.  These articles are worthless because they do not address the real world issues as to why certain regulations are put into place in the first place.  Instead, they just claim everything is some kind of conspiracy theory.
The world is full of grey areas and middle ground and most things are a matter of degree.  The wing nuts who have gravitated to Bitcoin see everything as "us against them" and there is no middle ground for them.

the theory is that most people are satisfied with fiat currencies and they live a good life using them.  Most places, with some exceptions, don't want their national currency displaced.  
Further, Bitcoin cannot replace a currency due to decentralization and the technical limitations of things like confirmation times.  the developers say over and over that Bitcoin cannot replace national currencies for these reasons but the cultists ignore this and keep making the claim.  people not familiar with Bitcoin look at it and pretty quickly see that it cannot replace other types of things like a national currency.  then they think all Bitcoiners are weirdoes and scammers.
Why don't you try to understand the actual benefits of Bitcoin instead of repeating the cultist nonsense.  Bitcoin is about doing person to person transactions with no intermediary.  it cannot replace national currencies, end wars, or any of the other nonsense claims by the cultists.  it can transfer value from one person to another without interference and that is good enough for me to think Bitcoin is a useful technology.  
as I explained before, thinks like bitlicense are not Bitcoin regulations, they are regulations when Bitcoin is interfaced with the legacy financial system.  it is drama queen stuff to call this "Bitcoin regulation."
If you want to be taken seriously you need a new nickname as well as some education about how Bitcoin works and what it can do and not do.  
@_date: 2016-08-12 22:02:02
I don't know where you get that, Bitcoin is full of kooks.  
If regulation is going to be passed it is better to have a rational voice rather than some wing nut who will be ignored.  can you understand that?
@_date: 2016-08-13 13:12:04
I agree Bitcoin will coexist with other financial instruments and other crypto.  in-person transactions of goods and services is a disaster.  Just try it yourself.  
local bitcoins generally charges high fees, requires dangerous situations by meeting strangers on the Internet, has all kinds of issues unless you use escrow,  and many of the users are violating money transfer laws.  
the issue with satoshi dice and shapefits was that they keep getting scammed by double-spend attacks when they accept zero confirmation transactions.  It works if you want to wait a little.  Bitcoin is better for gambling sites as compared to credit cards and paypal and wiring money.  
people do not want to replace the banking system.  bitcoin is not a replacement for banks, it is just does money transfers.  it does not do loans, interest bearing savings, etc.  people may wish to replace certain functions of the banking system like money transfer.

I don't know what you mean by 'settle' but the answer is sometimes yes, and sometimes no.  Bitcoin transactions are not reversible and so you are comparing apples and oranges.  I would never use Bitcoin to, say, order Bitcoin mining equipment so it is a poor choice when dealing with untrusted sources.  It is a good choice when sending funds to a trusted party.  It all depends on the specifics of what you are doing.

I can't help it if you don't understand, many Bitcoiners are completely clueless about how the world works and they get all their information from circle jerks.  If you have questions check out Coin Center and Niskanen Foundation.  
As for your question, the post is not about "Bitcoin regulation," it is about interfacing Bitcoin with other financial instruments such as exchanges.  Most people, including most Bitcoiners, want exchanges to be regulated to a certain extent.  For instance, many people complain about issues with Coinbase ... but Coinbase is not Bitcoin, they are a service that uses Bitcoin to exchange with other currencies.  So, to summarize, you don't even understand the difference between Bitcoin regulation and regulating service that happen to use Bitcoin so you don't understand what the problem is in the first place.

Bitcoin is a software program and is not political in nature.  It is simply a tool.  It has been used to trace drug dealers on Silk Road so I could make the same nonsensical argument that Bitcoin is "statist in essence."  Only a kook trying to pursue an agenda attaches a political association to a software program.  The common example I usually give is the telescope that had huge political and religious significance when it was first invented but nobody thinks that today.  that is because it is tool with no inherent political or religious significance.  it was a labeled that people with agendas slapped on it at the time.
the next problem with your discussion is the mention of "the state."  There is no such thing as "the state."  There are collections of different governments all with different missions and agendas that are made up of people.  once someone starts ranting about "the State" I don't listen to what they have to say because they are kooks with an agenda.
Bitcoin offers peer-to-peer transactions that are limited in several ways.  this includes waiting until the network comes to a consensus over the blockchain.  this means Bitcoin cannot be used for things such as replacing a fiat currency.  The developers routinely point that out but the cultists just keep making the claim.
Bitcoin has absolutely nothing to do with various government "losing legitimacy to rule" and nothing the sort is "self evident."  if you really believe that because you read on reddit thousands of times then you are a cultist who has no concept of reality.

There is no "best" because people have many different use cases.  I can see some consolidation around certain use cases but no one system is good for all use cases.  Certainly not Bitcoin as we see it today and the ability adapt is not there as can be seen in the block size debate.  The easiest path to solve the needs of consumers if to have a choice of different systems and people will take the easiest path.  Unlike some of the people here, most people don't care about any allegiance to any specific technology and will use the thing that is best for them.  
@_date: 2016-08-21 21:20:58
yes, and that almost always happens.  how else do you implement a complex set of rules?  You have an agency who is headed up by a political appointee and who has career employees.

@_date: 2016-08-12 20:53:18
Not sure what that means.  Bitcoin cannot do do some things well, such as in-person transactions.  It also cannot be used for the things like the satoshi Dice site for immediate payouts because people do souble spending attacks.  It is good for things like money transfers, purchases for things that don't get delivered immediatly, donations, and things like that.  
the first requirment for replacing fiat is that people want their fiat replaced.  There are a few countries where people want that but that is generally not the case in places like USA and western Europe.

In fact Satoshi dropped out at the same time several of the ignorant wing nuts started doing things he didn't want done.  he did not go around ranting about statists and claiming Bitcoin would end wars .  lol.  Roger Ver tries to claim the same hacker hacked him and Satoshi,"Satoishi Dice," and "Satoshi Rountable," the Foundation tried to claim Satoshi was a member, and, of course, the Nakamoto Foundation.  They claim that even though Satoshi did not say certain things he "spoke through the code" and what he said just happens to coincide with their whole agenda.  
The head of the Niskanen Foundation was recently on The Stossel Show and discussed this type of thing.  Basically, people taking extremist viewpoints that will never be accepted by the vast majority of the population don't do much to advance the cause of liberty.  It is also a constant debate from within the Free State project between the radical extremists who look ridiculous and more reasonable people who want to achieve something instead.  take a look at the let's Talk Bitcoin episode with Preston Byrne.

Huh?  A finance agency does not pass bills, that is the legislature.  Legislatures pass bills that give authority to agencies to create specific rules when the issues are complex.  Those rules are usually created after one or more comment periods.  This is true at both the federal and state levels.  there is sometimes debates over the rules concerning whether the agencies changed the original law by their rules since they are not allowed to do that.  An example is the FCC and Net Neutrality rules where there were disputes over whether they created new law when creating the rules.

As for the agenda issue, I do not distort Bitcoin to fit some ridiculous political agenda, I discuss it based on the technology and what it can actually do.  people who do that are called "Bitcoin haters" "Paid shills"  "statists" by all the crackpots.  they are mostly teenagers who don't know better and they will outgrow it.  Just look at the response people like Tim Swanson gets when he publishes a paper.  these forums are a joke and they push normal people away from Bitcoin.
As for me, I have a master's in physics and a BS in computer science from Rutgers.  I also did research for 27 years at a federal job.  Most of the people complaining about me are underemployed gamers with limited education and experience.  It is comical to watch teenagers and college kids explain how society has done everything wrong when they have not accomplished anything in their life and they have minimal knowledge on how the world works.  All they do is rail against all sorts of things and repeat nonsense they read on these forums.  they think because something gets posted a thousand times that it somehow makes it true.  Don't you have any sense how these forums are damaging Bitcoin adoption?  
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:10:19
Sure they do, most people want fiat currencies because that is what they need.  You just make statements with no evidence and even when the evidence says otherwise you just ignore it when it doesn't fit into your agenda.  That is why you are a Bitcoin cultist.  Just because someone states the truth based on evidence does not make then an "anti-Bitcoin activist."  The fact that you think there are "anti-Bitcoin activists" shows you are really out there on the conspiracy theory meter.  I am pro-Bitcoin activist and I am sick and tired of all the cultists spreading misinformation and giving Bitcoin a rep as being used by a bunch of kooks.

To be clear:  You are dishonest person who misrepresents the truth on a regular basis.  This is a common quality of Bitcoin Foundation Board members.  You are trying to create a rift between EFF and Coin Center where none exists.  
Bitcoin needs all the help it can get and you creating a dispute where none exists is damaging to Bitcoin in general.  You have already been removed as Executive Director but you should go one more step and resign your position as a Bitcoin foundation Board member.  What you are doing is directly opposed to the mission of the Foundation.

You kooks always have some link or quote that you think wins every argument.  of course you will claim that all these different people, scholars, satoshi, etc. all agree with you.  It is like the message in the genesis block, it "proves" this huge "conspiracy theory" about what satoshi meant when he developed Bitcoin even though you can't actually find any direct evidence in his postings.
I already explained there is no such thing as "the state" but you will continue with your delusional nonsense.  People don't want anarchy, most people where I live want more government, not less.

Like I sais, the laws are not always applied perfectly nor are they perfect.  however, the fact is they do catch some criminals.  If you are saying the intent of the law is to catch things like the 9/11 hijackers then you prove my point.  The law itself has the intent of stopping these things even if it not work in some specific case.  I would agree that some of the laws stigmatize legal transactions and are abused in some cases but they also catch criminals in some cases.  It is a complex problem that can't be described in a meme.
@_date: 2016-08-15 14:17:23
You are a cultist who goes around misrepresenting Bitcoin.  People see posts like yours, they try Bitcoin for themselves, and they think everybody involved is some kind of scammer.  All people need to do is try to shop with Bitcoin and they can see for themselves, they don't need stats or links.  
Look at the selection for the biggest event of the year, Bitcoin black Friday and you can see the dismal offerings.  I tried ordering from one of those merchants recently ... I have been waiting 3 months for my order and they hardly answer their email. I know all about coinmap, Bitcoin Black Friday, Bitpay's claims, etc.  I have tried them all and I can hardly find stuff I want or need unless I buy from Overstock or do a conversion thing to get Amazon credits or something like that.  as for coinmap, I already explain the offerings are tiny and when you visit the actual location you often find they no longer accept Bitcoin or there is some kind of problem.  
If you are so smart. what are your credentials?  I was able to get a master's degree in physics from Rutgers.  I guess I got that by being stupid and being unable to do basic research?  lol.
With Bitcoin you can buy carmels, hot sauce (the peck peppers say they hardly get any sales outside of Bitcoin Black Friday), Bitcoin miners, and a few weird items most people don't want.  There a few scattered restaurants and stores but often when you actually try to use Bitcoin there is some kind of problem.  There have been many examples posted here which you ignore or claim is anecdotal.  That is pure Bitcoin cultism, ignore the facts and post circle-jerk nonsense over and over with the hopes that it will become true.  Bitcoin is not a religion, it is a technology.

You have already been caught misrepresenting the facts.  Coin center has called you dishonest and your descriptions do not correspond to what the EFF says.  You insist on spamming these already-posted links to reddit to try to use EFF to misrepresent things.  Each time you change the story a little to try to get people to go sown some rat hole of minutia.  
the fact is you are engaged in a willful misinformation campaign against Coin center.  you used to say it was your personal opinion and not the Foundation and now you are saying it is the opinion of the members.  You just made that up.  the fact is members have varied opinions on the matter.  you are representing your small group of friends and business associates and not the Foundation at large.  However, the issue there is the difference between what you are doing and the stated mission of the Foundation.  The Foundation gets tax advantages by doing what it says in its mission statement.
As for Coin Center and EFF, Bitcoin needs them.  the EFF merely dabbles in Bitcoin and they are not enemies or on opposite sides with Coin Center as you keep trying to claim.  You are a professional wing nut and you look for difference in an attempt to divide people into "us against them" which is what wing nuts like you do.  it is why you are unfit to sit on any Foundation board.  
I should add that anything the Board does as far as policy is supposed to be voted upon by the board.  have they voted to harass Coin center by posting false and misleading information?  (of course not but that is the logical conclusion of your claim).
@_date: 2016-08-10 12:42:56
I skimmed the article and didn't bother to read it closely because it is just one more rant that you see from Bitcoin cultists.  I already explained that the article does not address the reasons for regulation in the first place.  First of all, companies are not entering into an "agreement" with finCEN, they are following law by registering with FinCEN.  The author doesn't even understand how FinCEN fits into the world or what their purpose is.  Their mission is not to promote commerce by putting on a "stamp of approval," their mission is to enforce money laundering laws.  Since the author does not understand the purpose of FinCEN the criticisms of it are all wrong.  There are many valid criticisms of finCEN and regulation but they are not found in this article.  If you go back to the old shows of Let's Talk Bitcoin they had a rep from the US Money Services Businesses on a couple of times who discusses the real issues and problems with things like FinCEN.

the private keys were used by someone to transfer the funds.  There is no way to know who had those private keys or how they got them.  With a system like this there is no way to know for sure ... which is why I think insurance companies will have a hard time insuring crypto systems like this.

I am not green to it, I am saying they are idiots who are ruining Bitcoin.  If you look back at the messages on Bitcointalk the crackpots drove Satoshi away and they distort and misrepresent Bitcoin because they are here for their agenda, not Bitcoin.  If the kooks were really "ant-statist" then they would not use tools such as the Internet.  
The space is not all idiots and crackpots, they are just the loudest people.  It is true some were the first but they are like a group of unruly teenagers at the Mall.  They are mostly young, ignorant, and they sit around making fun of adults even though they have not accomplished anything in life.  At this point all they do is drive away the potential adopters.  It does not matter what the political agenda is of those who adopted first.  In fact in the corporate world many companies don't prosper until they get rid of the founders, it happens all the time.  
As for the technology and it political ramifications, that is how it is used, not what it is.  I could make an argument that it is a "statist" honeypot so drug buyers could be traced by their payments like Silk Road.  An example is the telescope, in its day it was a highly political invention which challenged the status quo.  That does not mean the telescope itself was political or "anti-religion" and nobody today thinks the telescope is inherently political.  
Just because some people with crackpot ideas were here early that does not mean they are correct.  In fact Bitcoin would be much better off if people challenged all these cultisms instead of being scared of getting downvoted.  These people are really annoying because Bitcoin is a great technology but when you try to explain it to new people you have to spend 45 minutes explaining away all the crazy cultist claims before you get to discuss how the technology really works and what it can do.  in any case, I disregard anyone using the term "statist" as some kind of kook.  I never even used the term in a sentence before I got involved in Bitcoin.  I am all for Bitcoin and I think these cultists are idiots, what do you think the general population will think of these people?  I got involved in 2012 but that does not mean the people who got involved in 2013 have to listen to what I say or agree with me.  Early adoption means nothing and early adopters are owed nothing.

These people have no credibility.
As people get more choices they are likely to use those different choices.  You don't see people gravitating towards one TV station or one music service as more choices become available.  The same is happening in crypto.  For instance, you see people buying ETH when they don't even understand what it is and that trend seems to me most likely to continue.  I used to think Bitcoin would dominate but after seeing all the gridlock with block size and the willingness of people to use other things I think Bitcoin will end up as a choice among many things rather than dominating anything.  I don't want to go so far as predicting it to be the "myspace" of crypto but that is possible.

many people have reported issues with in-person transaction.  if you recall even Charlie Shrem's club stopped accepted it.  It is just not feasible with some centralized solution.  Bitcoin cannot be used for immediate payments like Satoshi dice, they had to adjust their procedures and it made it difficult to use.  bitcoin is still better for gambling sites in place of credit cards, etc. but Bitcoin is not optimal.  It is true banks break laws but you are not meeting strangers on the street.  I would never recommend local Bitcoins to anyone except in special circumstances like at a Bitcoin meetup.  Whether the banking system needs to replaced is irrelevant since Bitcoin alone cannot do that or even come close.
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:38:32
You are correct about new regulation, my comments to the NY Bitclicense is that they should have applied existing law to crypto and then do a gap analysis to see if there any holes.  they should not have created specific rules for crypto.
As for my comments, many people agree with me.  the only people who have problems with my posts are a small group of cultists who want to push their agenda.  i also never said the current system is "the answer."  That is typical wing nut "us vs. them" nonsense that the wing nuts need to cointinue their nonsense.  i say that Bitcoin does not solve all the problems the cultists claim.  many people have dropped out of Bitcoin after they use if and find out all the misinformation from the cultists.
It is funny how some of the most ignorant on here love to give out "pro tips."
As for someone paying me to comment, another of the many conspiracy theories that you see on Bitcoin discussions.  You must listen to Alex Jones.  lol.

If you transfer funds with the knowledge that it will be used in a terrorist attack.  That is immoral, illegal (as it should be), and I want to see the people arrested and put in jail.  In some cases KYC and AML laws (or the enforcement of those laws) are overreach and those problems need to be fixed.  They are not fixed by eliminating the entire system, that would make things worse.  KYC and AML are in no danger of being obsolete.  
The problems will never be fixed if you make faulty arguments like claiming the laws themselves are "immoral."

I opened my mind and I listened to all this stuff when I got involved in Bitcoin.  My conclusion is that the ideas are ridiculous and the people involved in promoting it are kooks.  they have just latched onto Bitcoin for attention because their ideas do not stand on their own merit.  That is why the cultists constantly misrepresent what Bitcoin can do and what it is, because they are promoting their fantasy agenda and not a technology.  It is amazing to me that you read this stupid crap on Reddit and you actually believe it in spite of all the obvious evidence that it is ridiculous.  It is interesting how you kooks use the Internet to isolate yourself in circle-jerk groups to promote ignorance instead of using the Internet to widen your knowledge.  Reddit voting also contributes to this by enforcing the circle-jerk mentality.
Volunatrism, anarcho-capitalism, and all the other weird ideas do not actually exist in the real world.  They are constructs of places like Internet discussion boards.  They are interesting to discuss to a certain extent but they have no real-world applications.
As for what people think, you have no clue.  I strongly suspect that you never discuss the ideas you post here when you meet normal people face-to-face.  I suspect you only discuss this stuff in these weird Internet discussion boards and you would be too embarrassed to bring this up to other people face-to-face.

perhaps he sees the writing on the wall.  take bitlicense NY for instance.  Jim Harper made very good arguments but they were ignored.  Why?  because the intent of the regulator (Lawsky) was to make  name for himself by holding hearings while in office so he could profit as an attorney after he left.  under that scenario legislation was going to be passed no matter how much Bitcoiners cry about it so you might as well try to affect the legislation that does get passed.  You need to understand the motivations of the people involved to get anywhere.  Fenton does not have that understanding or experience.  Brito is the best guy Bitcoin has for that job.

You don't know they were hacks, all you know is that people were told the funds were hacked.  With the nature of the private key there is no way to know one way or the other.  it is also very difficult to protect funds from rogue employees.
Part of the problem is that it is much more profitable to simply keep everyone's funds and claimed it was a hack from some unknown person.  I don't see how these businesses are going to ever get insurance.

people can say and do anything they want.  What you say reflects back on the Bitcoin Foundation because of the position you hold and your comingling of bitcoin Foundation activities with your personal agenda.  You specifically use the Foundation as a bully pulpit for your personal beliefs.  You keep ignoring this issue and claiming otherwise because you are a scammer.
The EFF only occasionally dabbles in Bitcoin from time to time and Coin Center does it full time so you cannot compare their positions.  All you did was pick out one issue where EFF wrote some paper and it differed from Coin Center.  Even though Coin Center and EFF work together you try to spin it as if they are on opposite sides.  Now you are using to try to create some kind of division in an "us vs. them" argument which does not exist.  Your overall wing nut agenda depends on "us vs. them" as a primary argument so you create one where none exists.
Nothing has been "proven" or even completed.  There are proposed laws being discussed.  once again you are trying to create an "us vs. them" scenario where none exists.  
If the Foundation was legitimate they would not be attacking Coin Center.   However, the Foundation is mostly a collection of scammers and kooks and it is an embarrassment to most Bitcoin users.  People like you don't do education, outreach, or anything else a normal industry group or Foundation would do.  You paid money out of your own pocket so you could have a title as a board member.   You are a Foundation scammer and it tells me the whole Foundation is problematic because they just stand by while one Director after another runs scam after scam.

Hardly any merchants accept Bitcoin now and just getting them to accept Bitcoin in the first place is a huge issue.  adding more to that is even a bigger issue.  
The first thing you need to do when proposing these things is to understand the market and understand what consumers want.  in this case you are discussing scaling so you are discussing the needs of people who don't use Bitcoin now.  This is why these things end up being solutions looking for a problem.  Bitcoiners are known for not doing this and just waiving their hand like you did.  this is why companies generally don't put developers in charge of product development.

There are many faulty arguments.  tim swanson actually made a video awhile back that lists many of the cultisms that Bitcoiners make.  it cannot replace fiat currencies, it cannot end wars, it cannot end inflation, it cannot replace banks, it cannot cause governments to fail, etc.  it can do some things well, that is provide person-to-person trustless transactions once you are satisfied the mining system is working as intended.  That is enough for me to get interested in Bitcoin as it has the ability to disrupt many things.

In some cases it is applied legitimately and other cases not.  the intent of the law is to stop serious criminal activities that threaten society.

Your replies are so evasive, do you think are slick?  I never said it precludes you from having an opinion I said your opinion reflects back on the Foundation and in Bitcoin in general.  I also say you made the situation worse by comingling your official stuff with your personal opinions like on your Facebook page.  I also said you paid out of your pocket to keep your status as a board member as part of your reputation.
There were several million in there at one point.  I guess they blew through most of it when Matonis is in charge.  in any case I got more legal decisions favorable to Bitcoin than the entire Foundation over it's entire history.  The Foundation was involved with regulation from time to time and Perklin says the Foundation worked with Coin Center.  maybe you should get your story straight with the other board members.  Either the Foundation worked with/against Coin Center and EFF or they did not.  I believe the tweets indicated they at least made their opinions known.
the minutes indicated you offered paying $10k payments to keep things afloat and keep your position.  I believe it is a business expense for you so you can go around claiming an official position with the Foundation.  Since you don't do anything for Bitcoin in general I figured your only purpose with the Foundation is to find new customers for your business.

Yes.  Do you understand the reasoning behind that or do just rail against all regulation?  People who do that may get Reddit karma but it does not advance the cause of Bitcoin.  This type of thing is not well understood among Bitcoiners which is why I say to leave these issues to Coin Center.

The Foundation did do some good things.  the Jim harper risk assessment is a starting point for a systems engineering approach.  The conferences were hit and miss.  On the one hand it did bring in a number of different people.  On the other hand, the conferences often featured wing nuts as speakers and left some people with a less than favorable impression of Bitcoin and the Foundation.  The first big conference had an agreement with free State radio who ran promotional spots all throughout the conference that claimed all government employee were murderers.  I complained about this and they just brushed it off as if it was normal to accuse astronauts, social security clerks, janitors, etc. as all being "murderers" by virtue of having a government job.
I stand by statement that the Foundation has been  "a collection of kooks and scammers."  If you look at the history of the makeup of the Board and staff you have many people who have been arrested and who have been involved in scams. n Bruce Fenton is still on the Board and he used to attack Coin Center on a regular basis.  In no way were they seen as "working together."  If the Foundation was legitimate they would have been actually been working with Coin Center instead of attacking it on Twitter and other places.  I certainly in no way want to be associated with people like Bruce Fenton and the Foundation just by virtue of being involved in Bitcoin.  I don't see the Foundation as representing Bitcoin or helping to promote Bitcoin. I see them as representing some extremist political agenda that I don't agree with.  They burned through millions promoting wing nut stuff and creating a negative atmosphere for Bitcoin and Bitcoiners yet they spent $0 doing thinks like getting FinCEN and trademark rulings.  A normal industry group would see those things as a high priority. 
If the Foundation were to get more involved in policies issue they will be seen as irrational and extremists and they will do no good in advancing policy since they will be disregarded.  Maybe if the Foundation gets rid of wing nuts it will do some good but given the makeup of the membership I don't see that happening.

@_date: 2016-08-12 22:00:32
I have explained to you at least 7 times that being regulated is vastly different than understanding how regulations are created.  You have ZERO experience in dealing with regulators who create regulations.  Jerry Brito's public appearances and videos speak for themselves.  You have no clue even how to measure what job he is doing because you don't understand how the system works.  (I see you are finally giving up on your false claims that EFF is opposed to Coin Center).  First of all there is only a proposed bill.  secondly, Jerry Brito cannot control what legislation someone proposes.  Bills are produced all the time that never see the light of day.  Now you are making some kind of claim that because someone introduced a bill that this somehow proves something (you won't explain what, you just say it is "proof").  
Your only alternative is to take some wing nut approach that will never be acceptable to regulators.  they will just ignore you.
If you want to create this measurement scale look at what EFF has presented and look at what laws end up getting passed.  under your measuring stick EFF should be disbanded too.  They lose all the time even when they make good presentations.  Welcome to real world Mr. Fenton, a place where reddit karma, Facebook postings, and your stupid meme's mean nothing.

the regulations you keep discussing are about exchanges and money transfer services.  they don't apply to Bitcoin-only transactions, they apply to exchanging Bitcoin with other currencies.  Whether you like it or not, agree or disagree, most people want those things regulated.  that includes most Bitcoiners like the people who lost money on Mt. Gox and Bitfinex.  even roger Ver sued other Bitcoiners when he lost funds on Bitcoinia.  
I don't know anyone who wants to turn Bitcoin into "another fiat."  there are people who want to see greater mass adoption and then there are people who make some false hyperbolic argument that they want to turn Bitcoin into another fiat.  I call them cultists because they see Bitcoin as a essentially a religion rather than a technology.  When some technical aspect does not fit into their overall political agenda they misrepresent what Bitcoin can do to fit their needs.  the problem is their misinformation and cultisms are easily seen by new users as false so they think Bitcoin is some kind of scam.  
While there are some exceptions, most people like their current system and see no need to replace it.  Now they may like having an additional tool that allows for decentralized transactions but that does not mean they want it to replace what they have.  the cultists will claim that the USD has lost 97% of its value, that everybody is slave, that all the currencies are going to fail and they will see Bitcoin as a lifeboat, governments will be forced to use and they won't be able to finance war. etc. etc. etc.
As for Bitcoin discussion boards like Reddit and Bitcointalk, those things are stupid and worrying about an "attack" by "shills" is just something that does not matter.  most potential users will never use reddit or bitcointalk and if those things are so important to Bitcoin's survival then Bitcoin is not that important to begin with.  What good is some currency if people like Theymos, Roger Ver, and a tiny group of developers can dictate how things will pan out?

There is no such thing as a debate over public and private blockchains since they don't effect one another.  
Trust and decentralization is a continuum and not a bright line like this guy says.  I guess that was Brock Pierce who answered and he knows what he is talking about.  The questioner was just some hyperbolic cultist.  if you look at his blog he has a post that says "Bitcoin's Computing Network is More Powerful than 525 Googles and 10,000 Banks!"  lol.

That is ridiculous.  The purpose of the law is to stop things like human trafficking, terrorism, and various other crimes.  the problems come in when the laws and rules do not really do what they say or the regulators over-enforce.

Another completly clueless answer.  Regulation is going to be enacated because people (including many Bitcoiners who lost funds) are clamoring for it.  You have ZERO experience in these matters.  You are correct to certain extent that people should push for applying existing laws before new ones are created but when it is obvious that won't happen you have to do something else.

The transaction.  The main purpose of the design of Bitcoin is to provide person to person transaction with no intermediary.  (You actually have an intermediary which are miners.  If that system works as intended you don't have to trust any particular miner).  It just happens that this causes other technical limitations.  one of those limitations is that you have to wait for network to come to consensus over the state of the blockchain.  these technical issues limit how Bitcoin can be used effectively.  In some situations it works fine, in other situations it does not.

Bruce fenton represents the Bitcoin Foundation and comingles discussions of his personl agenda and his official position with the Foundation ... then he claims he is "speaking as an individual."  That is not realistic.  he pays money out of his own pocket to the Foundation so he can have a title as director so he can give more weight to his posts.
fenton has no clue how regulators work or how things get accomplished.  he tries to create some kind of wedge between Coin Center and the EFF where none exists.  The truth is Fenton has no alternative plan excpet going around like a wing nut making hyperbilic claims and making Bitcoiners look ridiculous in the process.
As for the Foundation he ran, they did absolutly nothing to help Bitcoin, he helps his close circle of friends and himself.  With all the millions they spent I personally got more beneficial legal decisons that the entire Foundation:
Bitcoin needs Coin center much more than it need Bruce Fenton and the Bitcoin Foundation.

But they have not helped in the past.  The last executive director used to go around saying you are more likely to be killed by the government than terrorists.  While they were busy making Bitcoin have a reputation as a collection of wing nuts I was busy doing things like getting a [FinCEN ruling]( and having a [bogus trademark cancelled](  The Foundation, under previous directors allowed their logo to endorse things like Mt. gox and CoinLenders (a fake bank run by some teenager out of his parent's house).  
If the Foundation would start acting like reasonable adults and do some actual help I could see supporting them.  So far it has just been a collection of kooks and scammers who have damaged Bitcoin's reputation and attack entities like Coin Center who know what they are doing.
@_date: 2016-08-10 01:40:23
The logic of my argument was recently discussed on the Stossel show by the Niskanen Foundation.  Basically, a bunch of people who go around with extreme views that most people will never agree with don't really do much for the cause of liberty because most people won't listen to them.  People like you see on here posting thousands of comments over and over with extreme views really don't do anything to "advance the ball."  They might as well howl at the moon.  as for Coin Center, they understand these issues and most Bitcoiners who post here do not.
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:48:47
Shrem and Karpeles were arresting doing things directly related to their Bitcoin Foundation membership.  Karpeles even used the Foundation's logo to attract customers.  Vessenes was a scammer as you can see from all the lengthy court documents about his various escapades.  Jon Matonis is a wing nut whose word cannot be trusted.  Bruce Fenton is an unapologetic wing nut who post all kinds of weird stuff on his Facebook page and he is still a current Board member.  These people all did a lot of weird things over a long period of time while they were with the Foundation and their activities were readily accepted by the Foundation in spite of complaints. 
Maybe some things have changed from the early days but there has been no effort to distance the Foundation from all these things.  In fact Bruce Fenton remains and all you need to do is look at his Internet postings.  When I look at his facebook page my IQ drops about 10 points and he comingles all that stuff with Bitcoin information ... yet he says its all separate and his personal opinions do not reflect on Bitcoin.  lol.  From what I have been told Brock Pierce is another "anarchist" but apparently hides it from the public so he doesn't sound ridiculous. (he sounds fairly reasonable when he talks so I don't really know).
Maybe things are changing with a new director, I haven't followed things lately.  I have never seen any kind of educational programs, merchant support, promotional videos, etc. etc.  All I ever see come out of the Foundation is some wing nut ranting about regulation from people who don't know what they are talking about.  The grant program was cancelled after the prior management blew through millions without accomplishing much and the guy who wrote the risk report was apparently drummed out and the project abandoned.
You can pretend all these things didn't happen and try to make fun of me ... but that just shows me the Bitcoin Foundation has not changed.  You don't want to fix things, you want to pretend the problems do not exist.  
As far as I know the Foundation does very little because they are out of money due to mismanagement and the failure to expand the membership base.  This is due to the reasons I stated above, lack of transparency, and allowing the organization to turn into a private club run by Bruce Fenton and his group of wing nut friends.  I haven't followed things since he is no longer exec director but the fact that he is still on the board shows there has not been much change.
I also never said all of the members are wingnuts but many of the more influential members are so there will never be a reasonable approach to dealing with regulation so the Foundation should just stay out of it instead of causing more damage.

That is correct under the rules of Bitcoin being property.  If was defined under the foreign currency rules then the rules would be different.
@_date: 2016-04-25 11:03:29
That document from the IRS is guidance.  It was based on the fact that most Bitcoin transactions at that time were on exchanges rather than buying goods and services.  From what I understand if you use Bitcoin primarily as a currency you can possibly have it treated that way now.  of course it is best to change that ruling as the OP points out.  The guidance document also has IRS contacts and I have spoken with them before about Bitcoin.
As for supporting such a change the way to do it is to increase Bitcoin commerce.  Some people say this will cause the price to crash because merchants will cash in their Bitcoin but if people were buying Bitcoin as it gets cashed in then the price won't crash.  You should also follow the suggesting in the OP.

One is government fiat and one is crypto so they are completely different.  A government fiat is controlled by some known entity while a crypto system probably is not.

They are full of dumb kids who think they know everything because they discovered Bitcoin but don't know anything outside of that.

You mouth foamers are the worst.  You are confusing making changes to a database to chargeback procedures.  Bitcoin has no chargeback procedures so you can't compare the time for chargeback procedures to complete to a Bitcoin transaction.  For instance, a judge can order someone to return money or change bank accounts so technically they never "settle" in the way you are describing.  You are trying to make a bogus argument to dismiss the fact that Bitcoin has confirmation times that make some transactions difficult to accomplish.  this is an artifact of decentralization.
As for the lightning network, it may make things more convenient to use crypto but generally consumers don't need the expense and complexity of decentralization to buy a cup of coffee.  Most people are not worried about some central authority stealing their coffee money.

fiat money
 Neil Wallace  
From The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, Second Edition, 2008
Edited by  Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume

Abstract 
Fiat money is an intrinsically useless object that serves as a medium of exchange. One challenge is to construct models that depict the ancient notion that a medium of exchange is beneficial. Another is to construct models in which the medium of exchange has a low rate of return. This article reviews how those challenges have been approached and argues that progress has been achieved by taking seriously some old ideas about the circumstances in which money is helpful and about the desirable properties of money: money is helpful when there are absence-of-double-coincidence difficulties that cannot be easily overcome with credit; and a good money has desirable physical properties – recognizability, portability and divisibility.

It means you want to avoid trusting the middle man.  I agree that is important.  the kooks spin this up into this complex "conspiracy theory" where they claim they know the motivations of Satoshi and it just happens to all coincide with their entire political agenda.  Not that I totally disagree with some of the basic principles but the cultists have spun it up into this extremist position that is totally ridiculous.  Check out the Niskanen Foundation, they appeared on Stossel last year.  They talk about how extremists Libertarians make ridiculous arguments that are mostly wrong and most people will never agree with.  It damages the reputation of legitimate libertarians who want to make reasonable arguments.  Many Bitcoiners have turned into the worst kind of cultist nut jobs and most people think they are all crazy and Bitcoin is some kind of scam.

The idea is that many people will fork Bitcoin and the market will decide.  of course while doing that you may have a certain level of chaos but that is inherent in decentralized systems.

"What would happen if someone figured out the encoding program?"
As I understand it the way Bitcoin transactions are engineered there is a "wrapper" around the crypto system used.  You can replace the crypto algorithm with something else and still use the basic Bitcoin system as it is.  I believe old coins will have to moved to a new type of address that uses the new algorithm.  I also believe this leads open the possibility that "lost" coins could some day be recovered since they would be under the old crypto system. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:49:01
I think you are going to have to live with the fact that people are going to use different coins for different purposes.  
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:19:10
What goal posts?  There is no central authority, no brand to protect, no official definitions, no official fork, no official blockchain, etc.  You can have 50 different systems all called "Bitcoin" because "Bitcoin" is not a source identifier.  the problem is that you are used to things being centralized and decentralization is an entirely new concept sometimes with unexpected results.  BTW - In Bitcoin there is no such thing as "overwhelming consensus" as consensus is 100%.  If anyone does not agree and runs different software with different rules then their coins won't work.

No, it is not possible.  The purpose of Bitcoin is to have decentralized transactions.  If the coin is tied to an asset that some entity controls then you have defeated the entire purpose.  What you are describing is a security offering which is highly regulated.

They ruled that based on the use at the time (which was that the vast majority of transactions were to exchanges) that Bitcoin was not operating as a currency for tax purposes.  However, the ruling did leave open the possibility that some people could use it as a currency and the ruling gives contact points to discuss your specific use.

In the old days they did it because they had investments in Bitcoin and they wanted to see it grow.  This fee issue was known from day 1 but people ignored it because the block reward so was high.  Decentralization is expensive because of proof of work and people will need to pay large fees to use it.  The people who ran around saying transactions will be cheap, it is a solution for poor countries, you can put all kinds of stuff in the blockchain like property records/copyrights/ because it is almost free, etc. etc. was all nonsense spouted by cultists who don't understand how the system works.  if you want cheap transactions that happen fast then you have to give up some aspects of decentralization.

It is part of the free market and decentralization.  You don't see all these complaints about Jeff Garzik and United Bitcoin but you don't like Ver and his tactics so people call it an "attack."  It is also part of the endless conspiracy theories you see around here.  It was obvious from the time I got involved in Bitcoin that people would fork Bitcoin and that is how the system is supposed to work.  I would advise people not to buy into this particular fork but the same thing could be said about many other systems.  if you like the project everybody upvotes it and it is a great thing, if you don't like it is an "attack," "security issue," "malicious," etc. etc.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:13:03
That is part of the Bitcoin experiment whether it scales or not.  It was always known (even though many people claimed otherwise) that the system would be expensive to operate in the long run.  the block reward made it appear cheap in the beginning but decentralization is not cheap.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:05:24
Software programs don't have political visions.  What people do is project their political vision upon Bitcoin and then they claim everyone who uses it agrees with them.

You miss the point.  people can fork the system and each system has its own consensus.  Who decides what is the "minority chain"?  What you are asking for is some central authority to decide which is the "correct" chain and that does not fit in with decentralization.

Bitcoin does not have goals.  people have goals that they posted on GitHub and maybe you believe in some of those goals but that is not Bitcoin, that is an agenda by an individual.  those goals vary from person to person.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:14:45
There are provisions in the laws such that third parties are not responsible for the postings of third parties so the case would be dismissed before it ever got to the issues you want reviewed.  If it did get to that part the dense would be that no such representation was made to the user.  Also, there are numerous forks and altcoins that use the name Bitcoin.  One of the main Bitcoin developers recently launched "United Bitcoin" but that was just one example.  When you get involved in Bitcoin there is no contract, representation, that you will get anything specific.  If you get involved in Bitcoin you are on your own and the central authorities you normally depend upon are not there.  you are essentially accepting that fact when you get involved in decentralization.
I am not trying to promote any position or saying it is good, I am just stating facts.  in fact I think many people on here have oversold the benefits of decentralization.  It is only good for certain situations under certain circumstances.  If you want to use decentralized system then you are stuck with not being able to blame anyone when things go wrong and the situation generally cannot be corrected.  people involved in crypto are starting to realize the implications of all this such as rolling back the ETH blockchain when something went wrong.  You can run into significant problems when using decentralized systems that people here just gloss over but are obvious to people outside of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:33:31
I believe those are the facts but that does not mean I get to impose my facts on anyone else.  There are some people who believe Bitcoin Cash is the official Bitcoin.  Even the former head developer says that is the system he was developing.  If someone wants to believe some other system is Bitcoin then there is nothing you can do about it.  
The real story is you invested in one system and you want to protect your investment from possible competitors and you want to use centralized systems to try to protect your investment.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:42:53
You miss the point.  Google has a trademark and their trademarks are a source identifier.  In decentralization you have no source and you have no source identifier ... unless some committee somewhere wants to anoint the Core team as "official."  we can call the committee the Foundation for Educated Developers ... or just FED for short.  lol
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:09:53
But his system is also Bitcoin and so is Jeff Garzik's United Bitcoin.  They all use the same basic code.  You can decide for yourself what you believe to be the real Bitcoin but you have no authority to impose your decision on anyone else.  Now if Bitcoin were centralized a company they can protect their brand and that is the system you are used to..  This is a new type of decentralized system that doesn't have those things.

I never drank the kool aid.  Bitcoin is a tool that will force the hands of certain businesses and disrupt some business models.  I always thought the notion of some utopia was ridiculous ...  Bitcoin will either be worth millions or nothing, replace the US dollar, people will gravitate towards a single world currency, banks/governments will collapse, governance will revolve around the blockchain, end of inflation, government can't borrow so they can't fund wars (or hospitals), yada, yada, yada.  
Altcoins and forks are the best thing to happen to Bitcoin.  the same way Bitcoin is forcing the hands of various business models the altcoins are forcing the hands of the Bitcoin developers (the developers are really just a replacement of the fed).
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:52:16
The checks and balances are that users decide which version to run.  The developers can't force users to run a certain version.  However, if the version you run is incompatible with the exchanges/merchants then your bitcoins aren't worth much.

I have been involved for years and I know all about it.  The people who started Bitcoin made the reasons clear in their postings and papers.  Most of the stuff you are talking about is postings by kooks looking to promote a fantasy agenda so they latched onto Bitcoin.  Nobody accepted their agenda so they try to give it credibility by associated themselves with a technology like Bitcoin.  They like to claim everyone who uses Bitcoin agrees with their entire fantasy agenda.  
Satoshi dropped out when the kooks started to take over and wanted to create an issue with WikiLeaks.   Satoshi advised against it but the kooks went ahead anyway and that is when Satoshi dropped out.  the freaks over at the Wackymoto Foundation have documented it all.  When they are presented with the facts they claim that even though Satoshi didn't actually say most of things they claim, they say it is all implied by the software he wrote.  lol.  The only thing I hate about Bitcoin is all the ignorant weirdoes who have latched onto it.

ETH is fuel for transactions on that platform and is completely different than Bitcoin.  I find it hard to believe that most people buying ETH have any plans to do any smart contracts with their ETH (or even know what it is) so I don't think it is sensible at all for newbies to buy ETH.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:03:56
In that case you would complain to a central authority who maintains an official definition of what gold is supposed to be.  As for not minding, I didn't say that.  I am just pointing out that all of these issues are an artifacts of decentralization and you don't have the same recourse you would have under a centralized system.  If this upsets you maybe decentralization is not for you.

Satoshi created Bitcoin to do person to person trustless transactions.  You can easily spot a Bitcoin cultist when they will read all sorts of implications into the Easter egg satoshi put into the genesis block but satoshi never said all the things people claim that easter egg means.   Further, people did not "pour" into Bitcoin because of some bank bailouts.   Most of the early people got involved because the credit card companies would not process sales on Silk Road.  Maybe you should some research and maybe change your screen name so everyone does not know you are a moron.

I am not going to stop what I am doing and look up something to prove something to some fool on Reddit.  I looked up all this stuff in 2013 when I got involved in Bitcoin.  I found a comprehensive dictionary that had numerous definitions beyond what you find on web sites but I threw it out and I don't have it around the house anymore.  I also looked up what how economists used and defined the word in various papers which you can find easily.  You are just some discussion board warrior who thinks he knows everything because he discovered Bitcoin.

Being associated with all the ignorant cultists and kooks is the worst part about being involved with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-01-07 02:09:04
The point is there are no secure decentralized systems that settle quickly compared to centralized ones.  It is a tradeoff for decentralization.  This is a very important point to understand decentralization.  While it may not go along with your fervor to support Bitcoin it is actually a fact.  You can use centralized systems to eliminate this but that defeats the entire purpose except that it adds convenience.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:30:51
You are the dumb kid for not realizing the difference between a general dictionary and one specifically for economics.  "Fiat" is often used differently by professionals and those definitions do not always show up in general dictionaries.  The mistake you are making is of a laymen who never went to college and never did research.  While I studied physics rather than economics I did learn how to research things.  You should spend your time doing that rather than posting misinformation and curse words on reddit.  look up "dictionary of economics" and then look how actual economists use the terms in papers you find in Google.  then you will understand how the term is used in different contexts.

The issue is there is mo way to have a discussion with people like you.  You are the typical cultist who listens to nothing and you have some bogus argument for every issue.  You post links to your "fallacies" and you think you win every argument.  This is why people think all Bitcoiners are idiots/scammers/nut jobs/ etc.  Bitcoin does not function like other systems because of the confirmation times which is an artifact of decentralization.  Further, most people don't need decentralized systems to buy low cost items.  while LN makes things more convenient it does not create a need for consumers to use crypto which is the point the other poster was making which went over your head.  You are in such a fervor to repeat your circle-jerk nonsense you don't even understand the questions/issues.
You think you are winning arguments and promoting Bitcoin but all people like you do is turn people away from Bitcoin.

The question is why do you need to use expensive decentralized systems to buy a cup of coffee?  People don't buy Bitcoin just to be able to use it (except for people like to use new technology).  There has to be a reason to use it for small transactions and I don't see any reason.  Maybe it will be easier to use for some people who already have Bitcoin but I don't see the incentive for people to go out and buy Bitcoin just to buy a cup of coffee.  It is not like the government or banks are seizing coffee payments or somehow interfering with those transactions.

Bitcoin is for doing transactions without an intermediary in a decentralized fashion.  The question is why people need decentralization for small transactions and that really never gets answered in these discussions.  I think these things are red herrings and tend to divert people's attention away from the true value of Bitcoin.  
The same thing for the people who say bitcoin will replace credit cards.  For the most part people want the dispute process to be in place except in certain specific circumstances.  I often found it comical on Bitcointalk how in one section people advocated Bitcoin replacing credit cards yet in the mining section people said never to pay for mining equipment with Bitcoin but rather use credit cards so you can dispute the charges.

Those are not Bitcoin blockchain transactions so they don't have a miner fee.  I don't think you can transfer directly from GDAX to your Nano Ledger, you have to transfer to Coinbase and then transfer to nano ledger.  In that case Coinbase deducts the miner fee from the transfer

I looked it up a long time ago when I first got involved in Bitcoin.  One economist did an article where he explained that Bitcoin was the "ultimate fiat" but he was using the more general definition.  It is just a matter of people using different definitions and an economist may use the word differently than what you see here.

@_date: 2017-12-18 16:44:24
Decentralization is a continuum rather than a bright line.  How much any individual event causes more or less centralization is a very complicated question.  The theory is that everyone involved in Bitcoin is out for themselves (miners, investors, etc.) and that all this crowd participation of different agendas will work out in the end.  It is an experiment so it is not really known how it will turn out.  it seems to have worked pretty good so far.
However, the notion that highly talented developers who can command high salaries will work for free to serve the Bitcoin "community" is somewhat misguided.  therefore, it is expected that developers will serve some commercial interest but they can't force people to use any particular version of the software so there are checks and balances.

Your post says you don't understand the system you are getting into.  it is decentralized with nobody in control.  This means scammer, deceptive people, price manipulators, and all the other things you don't like have free reign in a system like this.  It is up to you, not some government agency, to protect yourself and understand what is going on.  If some entity decides to produce mining chips and do a 51% attack, if someone develops an altcoin that people flock to, if satoshi cashes in his coins, etc. etc. then your store of value can be destroyed.  There is nothing anyone can do and no magical government agency that can protect you.  That is the system you are agreeing to be part of when you use decentralized crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:13:01
Some people make calculation based on the retail cost of miners.  However, someone actually doing the attack will just manufacture the chips.  Right now I believe there are only a handful of places (I think I read about 5 but I am not sure) that can manufacture the chips.  If you control those facilities then you can control Bitcoin since you can make the chips yourself and prevent others from getting the chips.  Of course people can switch to another coin but Bitcoin would be done.  I don't think it would happen but it is an interesting thought experiment.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:11:31

It is like Al Gore and Rush Limbaugh arguing over global warming, you will never get any kind of useful information by listening to them argue.  They key is to ignore all those people.

Yes, more specifically, doing decentralized transactions person-to-person.  That can be used for all sorts of things.  For instance, the government can track Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain and use it as a honeypot to track drug dealers and arrest them.  Even though Bitcoin can used for that purpose I don't think it would be proper to say that this is what Bitcoin is.  The people who talk about replacing the Dollar, collapsing governments and institutions, and ending wars are latching onto Bitcoin.  They often try to claim that if you buy into the idea of doing decentralized transactions then you have bought into their entire agenda  of how society should be structured.  That is just not the case.

You also need to explain that the coin is meant to fund the company that developed the platform.  The business model is that it would be too complicated and expensive to collect transaction fees directly on transaction so they create a token that needs to be "destroyed" when transactions take place on the platform.  The company distributed the token to fund their operations and the token is regulated.  In fact they had to pay a for their dealings with Roger Ver.  The idea predates Bitcoin and at least one person (Mike Hearn) stated he got into Bitcoin after getting involved in the Ripple concept.

Many people here have a political agenda and they use Bitcoin to promote that agenda.  they want to replace governments, banking institutions, anti-war, etc. etc.  they latch onto Bitcoin and try to make a case that everyone who uses Bitcoin agrees with their political agenda.  Bitcoin is a technical solution that allows people to do trustless transactions directly without involving a third party which can be used for all sorts of different reasons and agendas.  people like AA lure people in with a discussion about technical issues and they project their political agenda on their audience.  The problem comes up when they start exaggerating what Bitcoin can do because they are really promoting their political agenda and not the technology.  it is not just AA but many people who do this.

Bitcoin is only a partial solution because it is possible to do things like a 51% attack and roll back the blockchain.  A user is trusting the Bitcoin system and that the blockchain is most likely immutable.  None of the systems are entirely immutable, the issue is trusting the level of security for your purposes.

If you are talking about comparable hashing power as well that that is more difficult and expensive but it can be done easily if they have the resources.  All that is needed is to produce the chips (or make a deal with the small number of facilities who are capable of making the chips).  They could actually destroy Bitcoin by doing a 51% attack and mine their chain secretly until they decided to release it.  
This all comes from the fact that Bitcoin is only an approximate solution to the Byzantine General problem.  the issue is that it is possible )albeit expensive) to do a 51% attack and roll back the blockchain.  Not that I am saying any of this will happen but it is certainly possible given the way the technology works.
The most likely scenario as I see it is that governments will issues their own crytos something similar to the Canadian "mint chip" proposal.  How well it will pan out and how much acceptance there will be is another question.

But the point is none of the coins are immutable.  They are immutable up to the point that the systems works as intended but those systems have different levels of security.  You can't just say that Bitcoin is immutable and some other coin is not.  You can say that Bitcoin is much more secure than the other coin and the Bitcoin blockchain is much less likely to be changed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:45:40
Your are confusing two different things.  You are talking about the value of the software system, not an individual Bitcoin.  There are thousands of these coins that use the same technology and I can start one in 5 minutes.  Most of them are worth nothing.  You just don't understand the meaning of "intrinsic value" and you are just repeating nonsense that you read here.  Not having intrinsic value is necessary for decentralization and it is a feature of Bitcoin.  So when someone says Bitcoin has no intrinsic value you should agree with them and point out it is a feature rather than try to come up with some bogus argument that anyone can see is not true.

@_date: 2017-12-27 18:02:28
It is still early and many people overstate the end game.  Bitcoin si about doing decentralized transactions and the tradeoff is that it is expensive, slow, and complicated.  For many cases decentralization is not needed or even desirable so you have to look at the use cases to understand how well it is adopted.  For instance, I don't care if my payment for a cup of coffee is decentralized but I may care if my foreign draft is decentralized.  People here often focus on the wrong things and exaggerate the use cases.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:57:37
Hobo nickels are an altcoin that never attained much value.  The point is that crypto currencies do not have any intrinsic value, they only have value that people assign to it.  You don't understand the definition of "intrinsic value."  Bitcoin has none by design and that is a feature, not a flaw.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:37:47
people who download the software decide how many Bitcoins there will be.  if people decide there should be more than 21 million then that is the software they will run.  That has nothing to do with how people value the individuals coins.  for instance,  dogecoin has no limit but people put value into it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:08:02
Decentralization is a scale and not a bright line thing.  For instance, you don't need the same level of decentralization for transactions of $1 vs. $1 million.  So it is perfectly fine to have systems with different levels of decentralization that operate simultaneously.  all this "us vs. them" stuff is just drama and hyperbole.

Yes, what it boils down to is that people don't really want decentralization except in specific circumstances where they perceive benefit.  People generally don't want to be their own bank and they want politicians (AA, Vorhees, etc. are Bitcoin's version of politicians) to run things for them.

The kooks who post all these wing nut posts don't even use Bitcoin for the most part yet they are going to collapse the entire financial system.  How?  By posting on reddit?  lol You are just upset because I don't go along with the circle jerk stuff.  So how much have you spent with Bitcoin in the last week?

Who cares about your childish Reddit memes?  I am very high on Bitcoin, I am setting up several web sites, and I am paying people in Bitcoin.  I also got that [ruling from FinCEN so US miners don't have to register as money transmitters](  I also filed legal action and got the [bogus BITCOIN trademark cancelled]( so small companies don't have to be worried about getting sued by some scammer lawyer.

My issue is that Coin Center is doing a good job in interfacing with legislatures and should not be attacked by you or the Foundation for doing so.  Those actions do not support or oppose any specific regulations.
The Bitcoin Foundation is about promoting Bitcoin and specific politcal candidates should not even be mentioned.  I believe the tax exempt status of the Foundation prevents political activities and they would need to change their status to do that.  in any case promoting or attacking specific political candidates or issues is contrary to the mission of the Foundation.  If you want to go around the Internet creating enemies by promoting your political agenda it ends up being bad for Bitcoin as you are sure to offend many people.  Normally Directors of organizations of this type go to great lengths to hide their personal opinions so it doesn't reflect back on the organization.  You do the opposite, you use your position at the Foundation to promote your political agenda.  Anyone visiting your facebook page is presented with all these wing nut proclamations along side issues surrounding Bitcoin and the Foundation and you make your status as executive Director clear on that page.  A casual observer will think that everybody involved in Bitcoin is involved with your political causes.

His story is that he called the agents at Waco, TX murderers and the agents investigating his fireworks sales (they were small explosives used for rodent control that he sold on Ebay) insisted on jail for that reason.  The charges are that he stored the explosives in his apt. complex.  Ver says he shipped small amounts and the complaints added up the amounts over a period of time.

Apples and oranges.  The blockchain can only handle Bitcoin transaction data, not general database entries.
@_date: 2015-12-03 22:44:05
Check the bitcointalk armory thread and they can normally answer questions.
You can run the core client alone and see if it is stuck.  is so delete the blockchain data and let it start over.  If not then it is the Armory database that may need to be rescanned so you can delete that data and let that run.  I configure it so the data files are on a spare drive so it doesn't fill up the c drive.

I have updated the Bitcoin Food directory.  A currency cannot be used once a year so users should start getting used to buying stuff on a regular basis.  if you have food items for sale listings are free.
This is part of an initiative to support Bitcoin 1.0.  while people like to talk about smart contracts automatically refueling their jetpacks or how Bitcoin will take over the world, Bitcoin 1.0 needs a firm foundation before that can happen.  The goal is to buy at least one thing per week with Bitcoin in 2016 ...  "Bitcoin Saturday."

I don't see any purpose to posting these types of threads over and over again.

I'm not sure that applies directly since people put the value on Bitcoin rather than governments but things like this are factors in the discussion.  for instance, once Western union sees their profits go down they will either lower their fees or adopt Bitcoin into their system, etc.  They won't just stand there and go out of business.

You opposed Coin Center just setting up the committee, not any specific action they were taking.  Further, I said EFF is not in a position to discuss Bitcoin issues as they are just poking their heads in without much knowledge in order to get more members.  This was evidenced when they got involved with Kaminsky and the claimed that proof of work would be gone by the end of 2014.  Coin Center is much more qualified.  as for you, I have seen your posts and you are completely ignorant about these issues and you don't know enough to be able to evaluate any positions held by EFF or anyone else for that matter.  I have been around EFF lobbyists for years and testified at some of the Internet privacy hearings around 1999-2005 time frame at places like the FTC.  It is a complicated lobbying system for which you have no experience.  My experience is limited but I can tell Jerry Brito knows what he is talking about and you do not.
The way you present your extreme opinion people will absolutely link your opinions to Bitcoiners the way you do it.   Your opinions are not just something people disagree with, they are extremely offensive to most reasonable people.  You would not have your business or the life that you have except for all the people you hate and call murderers.  I also see how people like you and Ver constantly lie about your agenda and act like martyrs with a bunch of phony stories.  the worst was way he used Ross's Mother at the worst time in her life so he could promote his agenda.  You guys are sick.

Liquidity and volatility are different things.  Also, something like the Bear Whale cannot be measured in just the % of trades because they could crash the market and cause other people to sell off.  In any case 8, 16, or 32 Million to disrupt the market is still way too small to reduce the risk substantially.  More people need to use Bitcoin to make it viable as a store of value.

Bitcoin has been hacked several times so don't keep repeating nonsense like that.  The Foundation has a Chief Scientist who can explain things to you and that HGistory of Bitcoin site has some of the more prominent hacks listed.  You can say the crypto has never been broken.  Besides, the developers "hack" Bitcoin on every release by putting in "checkpoints."  Not that it is necessarily bad in the way that it is done but it is a hack that circumvents proof of work.

Actually Matt Corallo recently said at a talk that only about 4 people have completely audited the software.

The only thing with a high level of decentralization in Bitcoin is the consensus of the ledger and that is done by a slow and expensive process called mining and it is only decentralized if you accept that the mining is working as intended (Bitcoin is only a partial solution to the Byzantine General's problem).
The claims that other parts of Bitcoin are decentralized are mostly without merit.  For instance, some people claim that "open source" is "decentralized" because people can fork it yet about 5 people control the repository.  The Bitcoin Foundation education committee claimed at one point they were "decentralized" because people can provide input.  Other have claimed Reddit is "decentralized" because of the voting system.  
Another problem is that many enthusiasts don't understand how the decentralization in mining works.  I often hear people say how Bitcoin can have instantaneous transaction confirmation by some technical trick.  Other, such as Brock Pierce, try to claim that currencies backed by a commodity are somehow like Bitcoin and decentralized (of course some entity controls the assets).  Now many in the banking industry think they can run a blockchain like Bitcoin but without the decentralized mining.  Many of them say the Blockchain technology is "faster" when, in fact, it is slower because you have to wait for the network to come to a consensus.  
Several advocates claim Bitcoin is "faster" and "cheaper" than non-decentralized systems but that is not the case.  You are trading speed and cost to achieve decentralization.  (Some of these arguments are convoluted as they talk about settlement times and chargebacks but the real comparison of speed is running a centralized database as compared to running a decentralized blockchain).  
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:54:40


@_date: 2015-12-01 21:37:57
Unfortunately zero-confirmations and decentralization are essentially incompatible.  It takes time for the network to achieve a consensus and there is no way around that unless you place trust in another entity in some way.

@_date: 2017-12-28 17:29:06
The name of the attack is 51%.  The fact that you can do it means the byzantine general problem is not fully solved.  As for other coins some certainly are viable and are used all the time.  not sure what you mean by "viable contenders" but the notion that there will be one and only crypto has no real basis in fact other than some people wan it to be that way.  Most likely people will migrate to different systems depending on their needs and those systems will coexist. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 01:19:14

The only things he argues against is the extremists viewpoints that claims Bitcoin will replace the entire financial structure.  Then you have a bunch of extremist Bitcoiners making fun of him without adding anything to the discussion.  it makes the whole thing look silly to an outsider.
Neither side discusses the more reasonable possibility that Bitcoin will be one of many financial instruments and the benefits of having Bitcoin as another choice is never really discussed.

Since Bitcoin is both a currency and a payment system the analysis is very complex.  You have banking costs, secret service agents running down counterfeiters, and on and on.

there is a difference between using Bitcoin for some political agenda and saying it is inherently political.  When the telecope was invented it challenged the religious agenda of its time.  the telescope is not inherently political and that is the mistake many Bitcoiners make.  People like AA, Vorhees, Lopp, Ver, etc. etc. are all Bitcoin's versions of politicians and they use (sometimes distort) Bitcoin when it doesn't fit in with their agenda.  they talk to the crowd because their main task is to promote their agenda (or themselves) and not Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a technical solution, so there really is no "pro" or "anti" bitcoin agendas in my mind.  if someone points out an actual flaw in Bitcoin they are labeled as "anti-Bitcoin" which I find as ridiculous as saying someone who uses a telescope is guilty of heresy.

I see you posting here all the time.  Have you even taken the time to see how factom works?  Did you even bother to read the other comments in this thread that explain how it works?  The data is not stored in the Blockchain, a hash of the data is stored there.  A centralized company maintains the data so the whole issue has nothing to do with hacking databases because that private entity is still going to have the database.  I suggest you take a breather from posting and take the time to understand how these things work.

As pointed out in the comments at Github, and email of a few paragraphs is not a "roadmap."  A roadmap is part of a systems engineering process that requires a series of documents that includes standard definitions, risk analysis, test plans, alternatives, etc.  It would take many months and quite a bit of work from many experts to come up with road map for Bitcoin development.  Calling that email a "roadmap" is just political posturing.

Yes, but they may ban you if you buy things that may be questionable and I believe they don't allow gambling.  They may track via the blockchain and ban you if you buy things like fake ID's or use gambling sites.  Since they are an exchange they are covered by all these money laundering laws so they have to do that stuff or face fines and penalties.  I buy regular consumer goods all the time and I have never had a problem but I see people on here complaining about being banned.

Yes, many centralized systems work well or at least good enough for practical use.  What this proposed change will do to zero confirmation is still somewhat unclear to me.  The developers put this through without really properly identifying the risks of making these changes.  much of the discussions centers around what has happened in the past rather than what would happen should an attack vector be profitable.  In any case it is a complicated issue and the current zero-confirmations systems are really 'hacks.'  maybe new 'hacks' are needed but in any case I would agree that more time is needed to understand and not break current systems.

Of course proof of work is wasteful of energy.  The question is whether the decentralization is worth the cost and it has to compare to other financial instruments.

None, but what is the point if someone can take away the main domain?
The domain name system is already decentralized to a certain extent.  Anyone can set up a root and anyone can change their DNS settings to point to that root.  Each root is centralized and most people choose the ICANN root but nobody can stop you from creating a different root and start registering domains.  It has been done in the past.  for instance, there was a ".biz" before the ICANN ".biz" that ran on a another root.

There is no built in incentive for the Bitcoin developers other than the appreciation of the coins they hold or payments (or potential payments) from those that want to influence development.

One reason is because the code has not been compartmentalized.  There is a set of Bitcoin consensus rules within the code (in addition to code that implements it which is operating system dependent).  If you change the consensus code it is either a soft or hard fork depending on whether it is backward compatible.
There has been discussion of separating out the consensus rules into a library that is OS independent but I am not sure where that stands.  There is more info about hard vs. soft forks on stackexhange and in vids from the Princeton U. class videos. Also look at the accidental fork in March of 2013 which is a rather complicated interaction between OS-dependent issues and the consensus rules.

The blockchain itself, no.  The Bitcoin blockchain needs to me "mined" to have a decentralized consensus and if Bitcoin dies people won't mine it.

You can attach data to the Blockchain in several different ways.  However, you must depend on some other service to maintain the documents related to the limited data stored in the blockchain and you can merely prove the existence of the document at some point in the future.  If that service goes away (or you don't have a copy yourself) everything is lost.  
The developers are trying to standardize the way data gets attached to a transaction (see  so these types of services can be built on the Bitcoin blockchain.  The next step is to attach data to a transaction which is "pegged" to some outside service.  This is what things like Colored Coins, Mastercoin and Counterparty try to do.  They have a system that sits on top of Bitcoin and they use the Blockchain as the basis for moving other assets they created.  The assets are moved based on a Bitcoin transactions that are linked to assets created within these systems.  
The terms "contract" in the context of Bitcoin or these add-on serves usually means a script that does something based on events that happen on the blockchain. 
The amount of Bitcoin in the transaction does not matter as far as the data fields are concerned so 1 Satoshi is enough (unless your transaction involved a payment of Bitcoin but as far as the data is concerned it does not matter)

Maybe, but much of it has very little to do with Bitcoin.  While Bitcoin has many use cases, some of which may be beneficial to things he talks about, that is not what Bitcoin is.  
The many fake investment schemes include pirateat40, GLBSE, and many, many others that operate on bitcointalk.org.  Theymos calls them "virtual companies" or something similar.  the main thing they all have in common is that they end badly.  Mr. Vorhees' schemes ended much better than most but it still generated a number of complaints.
If Mr. Vorhees that political perspectives that is fine but Bitcoin is not political in itself.

Attaching Bitcoin to political causes most people don't go along with is just hurting the adoption and makes Bitcoin weaker.

No, nobody sends you anything when they make a transaction.  A Bitcoin transaction changes the blockchain ledger.  Your client reads the blockchain (or sees the transaction being broadcast) and calculates balances from that.  There is no way to prevent a person from doing a transaction and updating the blockchain and there is no way to "refuse" bitcoins sent to an address you control.

You are using Bitcoin to promote your agenda.

All this "violation of ethical behavior" and "philosophical fight" is pure hyperbole.  
Bitcoin is a software program/protocol that has all sorts of use cases outside of your personal agenda.  Regulations that mandate the collection of personal information is done all the time with things like driver's license, taxes, and on and on.

They could mine in secret and release the chain later and wipe out the transactions during the period of time they were ahead of the network which could be weeks or even months.

Back then you could register a domain without paying and you were invoiced $70 for 2 years.  If you didn't pay the whole process of turning off the domain and re-releasing it took a couple months.  People would just churn these domains all the time by registering them, putting them up for sale, and only paying when a sale was made.  The company, Network Solutions, just started with a MySQL database to keep track and they got $70 a pop so they didn't care.

Anyone can create as many Bitcoin addresses as they need, one for every transaction if needed.  Some exchanges reuse addresses and they sometimes use wallets as sort of a "main wallet" for their accounts.  However there is no way to know how many addresses they use and there is no list anywhere.  Some addresses have been identified as belonging to exchanges along the way but I don't know what good that would do since it is not a complete list.
Some have suggested exchanges make their addresses public as a way of auditing but you have all sorts of issues with that, including privacy of their customers.

This issue in the news now:  
.io is run by a UK company and uses the same WIPO dispute policy of other domains.  The new gTLD's (generic, not associated with a country) are run by different companies but they all have to agree to the dispute procedures at least as far as trademarks are concerned.  Domains can probably be seized through the company that runs them.  The ccTLD's (country code 2-letter domains) all have different rules and the governments of the country running the domains has some say (some have delegated to private companies like .io) so the legal issues are complicated.
The hosting location is a completely different issue, seizing a server and a domain are different things.  You can always reconfigure a domain to point to a different network if you still have control.
Maybe I am confused about namecoin but it only registers names.  Those names need domain records associated with them so that runs into some centralization issues when that function is performed.

Bitcoin is an experiment in decentralization.  the system you describe is centralized.  Anything that is backed by an asset is centralized since someone controls the asset.  It is not a bug, that is the main feature.
A Bitcoin mining problem has to be solved in a predictable amount of time (on average), the difficulty needs to be easily adjusted, the problem needs to be difficult to solve but easy to verify by all the nodes running who-knows-what, and the problem cannot be done "offline" so the problem has to depend on the last solved block.

Coinbase is not the same as Blockchain.info.  Blockchain.info gives you access to the private keys of the wallet while Coinbase does not.  That means Coinbase essentially has control of the Bitcoins while it is in their wallet.  That seems fairly safe but it is not 100% if something should happen to Coinbase.
I generally move funds off Coinbase and keep them in an offline cold wallet and move them back if I want to sell.  That is more secure in terms of trusting a third party.  However, if you think can't properly backup your private keys then letting a third party do that work might be the way to go.  It depends on the person and how much it is.

Bitcoin is still in its experimental stages and nothing has been "proven" one way or the other.  Bitcoin has not been adopted in large numbers to make any kind of conclusions about how Bitcoin will function in the context of a larger economy and in conjunction with other financial instruments.

The issue involves barware like shot glasses so if registered they could prevent others from selling Bitcoin shot glasses, barware, coffee mugs, etc.
The point of me bringing up the Milly Bitcoin trademark is really an ancillary issue.  I do a blog about Bitcoin but I also sell items with a Bitcoin logo.  Therefore I have "standing" to dispute the application because I could be prevented from selling things with Bitcoin logos on them.  They could prevent others from selling Bitcoin logo barware but I can't really argue that because I have no standing.
in any case if I win the application gets cancelled and anyone can sell barware with Bitcoin logos on it.  As for Milly Bitcoin I can only make a claim if someone wrote a blog under the name "Milly Bitcoin" but I have no rights to "Bitcoin" or "Milly" alone.

I think a point many are overlooking is that the Bitcointalk.org forum is becoming obsolete.  Not that it won't get many users for a long time but it is becoming much less important over time.

As the technology expands there are many more places to go for information.

Each address has a public address and a private key.  As long as the public address is within the specifications you can send Bitcoin to that address.  There is no way for the system to know if you have the private key to retrieve those funds.  
Some systems that record intellectual property in the blockchain sends Bitcoin to a valid public address but the private key is unknown so the funds can't be recovered.
When you generate addresses you generate the private keys randomly and a calculation is done to get the public address.  The only protection against generating an address someone is already using is that there are so many addresses the odds are so small it is extremely unlikely to happen.
 is how the addresses are calculated once you generate a random private key in your wallet.

I am not sure what you mean because Bitcoin has no assets, it is an entry in a ledger.  
Don't confuse "open source" with decentralization.  The only part about Bitcoin that is truly decentralized is the consensus of the current state of the blockchain.  That is very expensive to do because it takes all that mining.
Open Source software is a centralized process where many people may input and anyone can read it but a few people decide which changes are accepted.  It has a decentralized component in that anyone can "fork" the software and run their own version.  
For Bitcoin if you run your own version that is incompatible with the main network then you can run it just fine but the coins won't work if you try to interface with regular Bitcoin users.  For example, you can't send Litecoin to a Bitcoin wallet.

The answer is simple, Bitcoin is still experimental so it cannot be compared to established systems and that is what he is doing.

I don't understand the "offline wallet" part.  A wallet is generally a collection of addresses and there is normally no way to tell for sure which addresses are in a specific wallet.  Also, there is no way for you to know the wallet is "offline" which usually means the private keys are on an offline computer.  You also cannot normally associate an IP address with a transaction (Blockchain.info reports the IP of the node where it first sees the transaction which is not the same thing).

Really?  Wars were around before money was "printed" so that seems interesting.  Of course it depends on the world switching over to Bitcoin and somehow preventing transactions that pay for war ... except the world won't switch over because a bunch of people are making ridiculous claims.

@_date: 2014-10-02 03:13:14
If you have money in the bank it can be seized.  if you keep cash the government can print more and devalue the currency.  With Bitcoin as long as you have the private key it cannot be seized.  That may be good or bad depending of your specific situation.  If something goes wrong you lose and nobody can do anything.  The developers often get email asking them to help return funds and there is nothing they can do.
As for Bitcoin to solve the GFC problem that would assume large parts of the economy switched over to Bitcoin so that is really a theoretical discussion of something which may never happen.  If it actually did many years down the road it would be difficult to predict what would happen.

Yes, I forgot, Blockchain will tie up the funds.  I don't think the rebroadcast is correlated timewise to the emails you get from blockchain.info but I am not sure.

You are confused about the process.  A hot wallet only has your public addresses.  You can only receive bitcoins so you can't get the private keys from the hot wallet because they are not there.
Once you have an address the private key for that address never changes.  
@_date: 2014-11-18 13:21:44
Yes it does increased the size of the blockchain.  The issue is the number of transactions and the size of the blocks in the blockchain.

I just stated some facts, I didn't express any onion on the Bitcoin Foundation.  Some people confuse decentralization with open source.  I am just pointing out that there are a small number of gatekeepers in projects like this and they normally have a rather narrow agenda.
However, I believe the Bitcoin Foundation does have some unique power here because they control the gatekeepers of the main fork but, like you said, it is not absolute power.  I certainly don't believe the current process is as free and open as you describe but they organized first so that is the way it is.

That video is hyperbole.  The banks will probably be one of the first major users of Bitcoin in order to do fast, cheap, and nonreversible money transfers between trusted parties.

It is not the same thing as a dispute between "Ford" motors and another place using the term FORD.  That is because Bitcoin is decentralized and there is no entity like Ford Motors that owns the trademark.  I have to argue that I want to use BITCOIN to sell barware but I want to use to refer to the dentralized currency and not a trademark that I own.  
I do own the MILLY BITCOIN federal trademark for blogs about Bitcoin.  If I try to argue that causes confusion I would have to argue that people looking for my blog would be confused over someone selling Bitcoin brand barware. 
Possible one of Bitcoin Foundations or groups could argue that the trademark would cause confusion but I am not sure if they can make an argument for standing.  In any case nobody filed anything.  I have a Bitcoin meetup group so maybe I can work in an argument there.
In any case I need actual TTAB decisions or court cases I can point to in my arguments.

No.  the public key goes through 2 different crypto algorthims.  If you do a transaction with the address your public key is revealed in the blockchain or when it is broadcast.
If SHA256 was broken you still could not calculate the private key from the Bitcoin address if no transactions have taken place with that address.  there is another algorithm protecting the translation between Bitcoin address and the public key (RIPEMD-160).

No.  Forking the software means just changing the software in some way.  There is a set of consensus rules and if you change those you will fork the blockchain.

I have done a large amount of transactions with Coinbase.  I believe the support is a disaster and acts in an offensive way to customers for a variety of reasons:
-Support just disappears when a problem arises that they cannot solve immediately.  I have has several tickets just abandoned and closed without a resolution.
-I have complained about the affiliate program not paying off.  I had to argue and open several tickets for each and every payment.  Instead of fixing the matter several Coinbase support personal accused me of setting up fake accounts in order to collect the affiliate payouts. 
-While support refuses to answer even basic questions they constantly advertise that they are spending time contacting Snoop Dogg, opening in new countries, and doing AMA's where they sit there and drink beer and completely ignore the support issues.
-I keep seeing numerous complaints about orders/accounts being cancelled.  When someone is denied financial services because of third party information the fair credit reporting act requires Coinbase to tell the customer where they collected the information that led to the rejection.  Coinbase refuses to do this and just tells people it is a secret or the customer is just ignored.

Bitcoin is  software program and is not political.  The telescope created all kinds of political issues but that does not mean it is itself political.
Claiming the people who developed Bitcoin have some sort of political affiliation somehow causes Bitcoin to be political is faulty logic.  It is people latching onto a technology in order to promote their political beliefs.
The issue about Bitcoin is not whether it will replace the dollar, the issue is how it will work in a world that also has the dollar and many other currencies.  All this nonsense talk about how it will replace the dollar and cause banks and governments to collapse just drives normal people away and makes Bitcoin weaker.

Who knows what you are talking about.  He is merely saying that Bitcoin has more features than just money as it is other things than things like paper money or cowry shells.  Money and the distributed consensus are not completely orthogonal because the mining depends on the incentive of getting more money.  
People who try to separate Bitcoin into orthogonal components are often the people who describe it incorrectly.  For instance, some people only see it as investment.  Other people only see it as a vehicle to promote a fantasy agenda.  They look at Bitcoin with blinders on and fail to see it as a whole system.

The Bank of England doesn't understand that you need some kind of incentive to operate a blockchain.  It is theoretically possible without Bitcoin or some Altcoin but you have to get all these people around the world to mine this alternative blockchain but they don't say how.
A blockchain is just a ledger but it is agreed upon using a decentralized consensus.  A "centralized blockchain" is just a normal ledger that banks have always used and that is much cheaper to operate but it is subject to fraud because a small group verifies it instead of the entire network.

Bitcoin is supposed to be about not trusting people yet you constantly expect people to trust a small number of unstable individuals such as yourself who have a terrible track record.  
Whoisguard is not as a secure as keeping it your own name for a variety of reasons.  Enom is another issue as they are a different entity and if you run into legal issues they are far from the best choice and most of the issues have nothing top do with the US government.  That is part of your delusional paranoia and the fact that you don't listen to anyone outside of a small group of unstable people who don't know much outside of the world of Bitcoin.  this was all explained to you before.
The Foundation says it supports Bitcoin.org which is different than hiring Saivann directly.  
bitcoin.org is openly being run by the Foundation as it states it is run by mostly Foundation employees and they additionally support it.  As for hiring employees and paying them more than $500 I believe most, if not all, states require there to be a registered business.  It is insane to hire employees without protecting your assets and setting up an LLC or other corporation.  There is also a huge difference between hiring employees and hiring independent contractors.  This further shows that you have no idea what you are doing outside of Bitcoin and you cannot be trusted to be competent.
If you don't have an LLC for bitcointalk.org you are setting yourself up to be sued for everything you own given the stuff that goes on there and your irresponsibility in running it.

Also, people usually have many addresses so that is very complicated situation as well.  Seeing coins transferred to addresses to address may give some indication but actually proving who owns all the addresses is another matter.  "Change" addresses further complicates things.

Looks like you didn't read the document.  I don't see any of those types of expenses and they seems to show a loss after the expenses of the salaries (Gavin, Lindsie Holland, Patrick Murck) that is more than half their revenue right there.  They have hired some people here and there but there are no large expenses and their budget is a tiny speck of dust compared to other major players in DC.  The Foundation isn't going to influence anything in DC using their financial resources.  As of other venture capital I don't really know but I don't think it is going to be that much.  
Also, they checked the box that they are not endorsing any specific candidates.  I suspect that may have to do with the type of entity under IRS rules but that is a question for Patrick Murck.

It is designed to retarget the difficulty to find blocks every 10 minutes.  However, the hash rate increases during the retargeting period (which is about 2 weeks) so blocks are found at an accelerated rate.  Right now it is just over 8 blocks/hour instead of 6 (see   the total is still 21 million so things like block reward halving will occur sooner when things are accelerated like this.

Yes.  They could start mining at the block before the transaction.  Eventually that alternate chain will have more work than the original chain.  They then release the alternate chain and all the other blocks will be orphaned.  They will then need to mine a transaction that spends the original coins before the unwanted transaction is mined.

Bitcoin can and will certainly be classified as a financial instrument.  Bitcoin stores and transfers value and that is why it is so important. The issue with authority is that NY State only has authority over consumer issues and not things like terrorism which is the authority of the feds such as FinCEN and NY state may have overstepped their authority there.
The part about entities that are covered under current banking regulations is also an issue.  The issue there is that decentralized currencies should have been reviewed under current law first, you do a gap analysis, and then you propose new rules if needed.  They didn't do that, they just slapped together new rules without doing their homework first.  It seems Lawsky wanted to get his name in the news so he had hearing and he is the first to propose new rules.  Publicity is his goal.

I do read all these articles as they come out and none of them really make any sense which is why I asked the question.  As I pointed out, the clerk's office determines what property rights there and what it says in some blockchain does not matter.  Plus, suppose I lose my private key, what if I get sued, what if someone sues and gains my property rights, what if I die, etc.  None of those events have anything to do with transactions on some blockchain yet the result is an ownership transfer.  I get the impression it is a bunch of people running around saying "blockchain" without any idea how they will actually use it in the real world.  Real estate property ownership is centralized so I don't see any benefit of trying to put a decentralized system on top of that.  Maybe there are some business cases I have not thought of but I don't see any described in the articles.  (One guy even calls Coinbase a Bitcoin 2.0 company, which it is not).

Long before any competing implementations came out I always perceived it as a small group who have control over the repository.  I believe it was one or two and then expanded to about 5.  When the system is questioned they often become very defensive and BTCdrak will make one post after another to try to divert attention from any probing questions.  I have also seen messages get deleted from github so who knows what has been deleted or changed.  You also have the implementation and the consensus rules which is really two projects.
The developers do not "serve the community" because the community does not pay them.  If they are an employee it would be a conflict of interest to do things that "serve the community" if it conflicts with their employer's wishes.   Bitcoin is not a charity, it is an incentive system.

Yes.  The result will probably be that new cryptocurrencies with new features will constantly be competing to "take over" the market and people will jump to the new system if they think it is better for their purposes.  The network effect will slow down the "jumping" but in the long run I doubt if any one system will dominate over an extended period because of this reason.  Bitcoin might be "for you" for now but don't plan on it being so in the long term.

As I have been discussing for a couple years now, these things have to be put into a risk analysis and evaluated based on the entire system.  Random Reddit postings and emails (which you call a capacity plan) don't cut it.  These are not plans or roadmaps, they are emails and postings that could be the basis of an actual plan but that never gets done.  I have seen individual developers discuss these types of plans from time to time but there is never a concerted effort to do it among the majority of players.  
Anyone who has worked in system engineering for any length of time will see the developers as complete amateurs when they point to the various emails and postings and call them "roadmaps."  A roadmap sets a timeline for the scope of the roadmap , provides standard definitions, statement of problem, statement of current baseline, test results, and discussions of possible alternatives.

Technically that is true.  Dozens is really a small number as there are projects that have thousands of full time people.  Of those dozens most make smaller contributions while a much smaller group effectively runs the group.  The people involved generally become very defensive when the issue is brought up and it is rarely handled objectively by the developers themselves.  Matt Corallo addressed it at a recent presentation and he said that there is really not much that can be done about it.  I would agree with that but there is a difference between saying that and pretending the situation does not exist.

All this nonsense has driven away most normal people and people who think for themselves and all you are left with is people who will upvote whatever cringe worthy nonsense they think people here will agree with.  
I really don't follow all the drama and nonsense anymore and I just checked in because the price is dropping.  Obviously a model where highly knowledgeable technical people who can command high salaries are supposed to spend all their time working as a volunteer is a non-starter.  The early developers had Bitcoin and made money by the rapid increase in the exchange rate but that is not a permanent plan.  Instead of upvoting posts about some kind of plan where developers will be paid in the long term there are upvotes for cultist nonsense notions that these developers will work for free.  It is kind of like the people here in New Jersey who expect the government to do everything for them for "free."

The definition of alt is different for different people.  It used to mean coins that depended on the Bitcoin development team but now it may mean any other crypto.  
Another system could become popular just as fast as Bitcoin.  Actually, since Bitcoin broke ground something new could take over faster.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, it is just an evolution of cryptocurrencies.  Nobody is tied to Bitcoin or any one system and that is good.

LOL, you have the slogans down pat.  All cryptos are "censorship resistant p2p money."  It is also not a "criticism" as Bitcoin is not religion, it is money.  Other "censorship resistant p2p money" will evolve and eventually die when it can't be improved and something else comes along.

haha.  You have admitted that your agenda is to get people to use Bitcoin so they could agree with your political agenda.  Bitcoin is a technology that can be used by anyone.  You want it to be your private club of like-minded people yet at the same time you want mass adoption.

It is about a matter of degree.  If someone writes a technical paper that discusses all the issues irrespective of whether it conforms to some sort of agenda that that is mostly non-political.  If someone makes tweets to promote some agenda in place of an actual technical discussion then it is more political than technical.

That is the point, I am not claiming "Bitcoin" for some product, I am claiming "Milly Bitcoin" for a blog just like "Bitcoin Magazine" has a registration for a magazine.  You seem confused as to how trademarks work.  It is a designation of the source of a product or a "brand."  
If someone registers "Bitcoin" for barware and put Bitcoin logos on it they are not designating a brand, they are describing a product that has Bitcoin logos on it.  If they register that they can stop me from selling items, such as barware, with Bitcoin logos on it.

When discussing established currencies that is sometimes true.  It is understood from the context.  Bitcoin does not fall into that category.  Search Google for "Bitcoin is not a currency" and you will see all kinds of explanations.  I think it is going to far saying it is not really currency but it is just currently a poor currency.  The USD is probably the best performing currency as it is the most widely accepted and is a huge percentage of day-to-day transactions.  OK, so I can buy honey caramels, cutting boards, and hot sauce from a few vendors but I can't just go buying random items because I can't find many businesses who accept it.

Most people in Bitcoin have no clue about law, starting a business, or operating financial services.

Yes, but it keeps Bitcoin centralized since you can't pay for new developers and it doesn't support new companies and web sites.  If you want Theymos/Ver/Vorhees/AA/Todd agenda coins then you are in luck.  if you want some diverse ecosystem that is less centralized then there is quite a bit of work to be done.

Of course they do.  People do not want criminals to have unrestricted money transfers.  People are against over-burdensome regulations but they are not against reasonable regulation.  In some cases it has become unreasonable and that is what people are against.
I pointed out the Niskanen Foundation to a few people (they recently appeared on Stossel).  They discussed how these poorly constructed arguments are doing nothing for the cause the people are trying to promote.  People on here claim the laws are "immoral" and there is no support for them and they don't do anything to catch criminals.  All of that is not only false, it is ridiculous.  People are upset when the laws are not applied correctly, not that they exist.  That is why these arguments put forth here never gain any traction, the people making them are either out of touch with reality or they are just lying to promote their agenda.  That is not to say the people are right or wrong, but that is the sentiment of the general public.
While I never worked with KYC type stuff, I did do research for aviation security.  I can tell you first hand that people want the government to do all sorts of things and implement all sorts of regulation because they think it will make them safer.  Now these regulations have come to the point of disrupting normal flights and people complain.  However, that does not mean they want all regulation to be eliminated.  They want the problems fixed while still having reasonable regulation.  I have been in meetings where the participants had family members blown out of the sky by terrorists and I can assure you they want all sorts of regulations that you never even though of.  they will win the argument 100% of the time when people say the laws are not wanted and should be eliminated.  It is not a reasonable goal that could ever be achieved.

All you people know is a few links passed around on forums like this.  The people who do that rarely have any sort of educational background in the subject and they pass around these types of links as if they know everything.  That is why so many people can't stand Bitcoin cultists and think they are all fools.  Not that all the ideas are completely wrong or that people disagree with everything that is said.  the problem with the cultists is that they spin everything up to an Alex Jones-like description.  of course if anyone points that out they are "statists" "paid shills for "government/banks/etc." "hate freedom" or some other kind of nonsense.  I still cannot believe how many crackpots have been attracted to Bitcoin.  of course most of the discussion has nothing to do with Bitcoin because it is not designed to be a day-to-day currency, it is designed to do transfers in a decentralized manner.  The developers point that out all the time if you ever read their discussion list but the cultists just keep ignoring all that and sit around all day posting nonsense.  They think posting something stupid thousands of time will somehow make it true.
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:19:09
It has nothing to do with regulatory pressure (That is from AA, the biggest attention troll in Bitcoin who sounds more like Alex Jones every day), it has to do with usability.  Your conspiracy theory has nothing to do with it.  It doesn't prove anyone's identity, it allows users to enter information securely and it has to do with a feature that most payment systems have and most merchants and users want.  It has nothing to do with opting out of Coinbase or Bitcoin as a merchant processor and they are private centralized companies anyway, not Bitcoin.

Many people here cultists who do not debate, they rally around in a circle-jerk and harass anyone they don't like.  It is about time educated Bitcoiners started calling these people out for the nonsense they spew.  Most of the intelligent people have simply dropped out the discussion boards at this point.  They treat Bitcoin like a religious cult rather than a technolofy and trying to debate them is like trying to discuss religion with a fundamentalist.  There is really nothing else to do except to call the people crackpots.  These people use the Internet and all the things that go along with the infrastructure of society and when they see something they don't like they cry "anarchy" and call everyone "statists."  They are all con artists, scammers, and foolish young kids.  They call everyone a troll every time they get challenged on some of the stupidity that gets posted here.
As for Hale-Bopp, it is associated with cult who wore Nike sneakers and committed suicide when Hale-Bopp came close.

I run into people who complain about this misinformation stuff all the time.  they think Bitcoiners are idiots and scammers and it damages the reputation of Bitcoin.  The posts should be about providing ideas to improve Bitcoin as a currency rather than making false claims.  Unfortunately the false claims are not limited to this.  Every time you see an article that is negative about Bitcoin you see all these crazy comments from circle-jerkers who get everything wrong.  As a result, many outsiders think the whole thing is a scam.  Instead of correcting these misperceptions Bitcoin cultists enforce them by spouting obvious nonsense.  Then they sit around making fun of the people who think it is scam which makes things even worse.  This is a huge drag on adoption and makes it more difficult to improve the stature of Bitcoin as a currency.

It is complete nonsense to the vast majority of the population.  The funniest thing is that the "anti-statist" crowd uses the Internet to spread their message.  They also use roads, planes, hospitals, and all the infrastructure that goes along with it.  It took civilization tens of thousands of years to develop all this stuff that you say should be abandoned. 
I have a very open mind and I looked into this stuff and I found it to be completely ridiculous.  Now if you listen to (what I consider to be) legitimate libertarians they discuss how government has gotten too large and things get over regulated then I agree 100%.  An example of Bitcoiner libertarian who makes sense you can check out Preston Byrne.  He appeared on Let's Talk Bitcoin awhile back and the kooks started attacking him and one guy said he should be hanged for not being libertarian enough.  That Stephanie Murphy kept interrupting him and laughing at him.  Someone like Preston Byrne has the ability to bring in normal people to Bitcoin while Stephanie Murphy is an ignorant agenda pusher who constantly misrepresents Bitcoin.  I stopped listening to let's Talk Bitcoin after that.  
I would also add that the term "anarcho-capitalist" is one of dumbest things I have ever heard in my life.  While an over-regulated marketplace is very problematic an unregulated marketplace is worse and capitalists would be unable to function in such a system.  What the real story is that these people are selfish and they want to use all the infrastructure to their benefit.  Then when there is a problem they (by "they" I mean people like Roger Ver and Eric Vorhees) want to cry like a baby and claim the whole system should be eliminated (except in cases where they benefit of course.)  So, to summarize, you want to use the Internet, you want police and military protection, you want to use roads and planes, and you want someone to complain to when your Bitcoin miner doesn't get delivered in 2 weeks ... but other than that you want the system to be destroyed.  lol.  
I suggest you check out the Niskanen Foundation.  The head of that group was recently on the Stossel program and he discussed how all these stupid arguments you propose to nothing to advance the cause of preserving liberty because the arguments range from being flawed to being totally ridiculous and most people will never agree.
Nobody cares about a quote from some guy in the 1800's.  You people always bring up these quotes and links as if they are important when they are not.  As for a Reddit score, who cares?  The Bitcoin subreddits are full of kooks and some of the best comments on here have large negative scores.  I don't even check my score or care what it is, that stuff is for circle jerkers.
In any case this a Bitcoin subreddit.  You post here because you want to use Bitcoin as a way of spreading your agenda because it does not stand on its own merit.  Otherwise you would be posting in subreddits meant for that purpose.

What reported stats?  the ones that talk about the exchange rate?  the exchange rate does not measure performance as a currency but rather as a commodity.  If you actually try to use Bitcoin on a regular basis you can see for yourself without anyone else explaining it to you.  
A simple explanation is at:
•unit of account 
a standard monetary unit of measurement of value/cost of goods, services, or assets.
• store of value 
An asset such as money or gold that is purchased or accepted as payment for goods and services for its ability to purchase other assets in the future without rapidly losing its purchasing power.
• medium of exchange 
An intermediary used in trade to avoid the inconveniences of a pure barter system, such as money.

The concept is that many things cannot be defined as "centralized" or "decentralized" but rather there levels of decentralization.  Many of the Bitcoin extremists you see here want everything categorized as either centralized or decentralized when many system fit somewhere in between.  There are certainly some use cases where "in-between" are good enough for their purpose even though it is not strictly decentralized.  It is actually a very complex analysis in many cases.  Entrepreneurs and technologists are investigating the possibilities and the cultists (who add nothing useful to the discussion) sit around making fun of them.

The issue with paypal is the centralized nature and the fact that they stop payments and reverse them.  this issue has nothing to with that so you are the who is "agenda trolling"
As for Bitcoin, it is now highly centralized in some respects because the group of developers are tiny and the major information channels are controlled by even a smaller number of people.  Keeping it small means keeping those things highly centralized.  Of course you don't want to give up its main features that make it good to begin with.  You can't compress these issues into tweets and it is only con men and political operators who try to do that.

That is a discussion of currencies already known to perform well so it is understood by the context.  Bitcoin has never been performing well as a currency and there are many articles that discuss that.  
There are some smart people still here and I have seen some of them comment how this claim is misleading.  unfortunately many of the smart people have left places like Bitcointalk and reddit because of all the circle jerking and misinformation.  It looks silly to outsiders and they leave thinking the whole thing is a scam and/or everybody involved is a kook.  Bitcoin is still performing very poorly as a currency and that is something to be fixed and sitting around lying about it doesn't help matters.  This is purely circle-jerk nonsense for people who sit around all day posting "hodl" "to the moon" "they get it" and "gentlemen."  
Also, since you point it out, high volatility is a sign of a currency that is performing poorly.  Do you ever read anything about Bitcoin outside of Reddit and Bitcointalk?

Rising value is a good thing but that is the commodity aspect.  Performance of a currency is based on things like merchant acceptance and how much stuff is transacted, etc.  Buying stuff once a year on black Friday is not a good currency.  I try to buy things all the time with Bitcoin and I have trouble unless I use a conversion system such as buying gift cards.  I had set up a site at Bitcoin Food a coule years ago.  About 1/3 of the merchants who accepted Bitcoin in 2013 no longer do so.  the ones that do say they hardly get any sales beyond black Friday.  Bitcoiners need to work to improve that instead of sitting around circle-jerking all day and spreading misinformation.

well at every hearing law enforcement has a whole list of people they prosecuted and a list of crimes they supposedly committed based on KYC laws.  the US has an entire department of lawyers at FinCEN that does that.  Then we have the other people who simply argue like you do and they have little or no facts to support that so the argument is lost.  Now if you came in with list of abuses and said things have to change then you can have a good argument.

The term "anti-statist" makes no sense.  Normal people think there are good things and bad things about governments.  The people who claim to be "anti-statist" are generally kooks who claim they are anti-statist yet they use the Internet, fly in planes, use US dollars, etc. all the time.   Now if you say the government has too much control and Bitcoin is one way to circumvent that then I believe you 100% and I fully agree.  I can't stand the people who turn it into some Alex Jones-like conspiracy theory and I want no association with those people in any way as they are an embarrassment to themselves and to Bitcoin.    
I saw the guy from the Niskanen Foundation on Stossel recently.  He explained how all these extremists and wackos damage the cause of preserving liberty by making nonsense arguments.  People like Ver and Vorhees have just latched onto the technology as a way of promoting their fantasy nonsense and the vast majority of the potential users will never agree with their message.

"Backed" means that if the exchange rate goes to zero you still have something.  Decentralized systems cannot be "backed" by anything or they won't be decentralized anymore.

The guy is an ignorant agenda troll, who cares what he says?  All he does is post nonsense because he thinks it will advance his fantasy agenda.

Bitcoin is a great technology and it is unfortunate that so many agenda trolls are screwing it up.
@_date: 2016-06-10 22:46:53
No, you just don't want to admit the logical conclusions of your agenda since it is ridiculous.  To compensate for that you come up with all these nonsense arguments to say it is not really that way.  in any case since I got involved in Bitcoin I have learned to hate all these anarcho-people and all the nonsense they spew.  I would not care except they constantly spread misinformation about Bitcoin because they are promoting an agenda and not Bitcoin.  They have just latched onto Bitcoin because people don't listen to their message so they want to try to associate their agenda with a technology.  then they want to say everyone who uses Bitcoin agrees with their entire agenda which is very far from the truth.

That is ridiculous.  You are a crackpot who has no contact with the general public.  I already pointed you to the Niskanen Foundation.  They routinely explain how poorly constructed arguments like you just gave do not advance the cause you are trying to promote.  Most potential Bitcoin users are not against all AML laws.  people are against some laws that are overburdonsome but they certainly are not against all of them.  the people who go around saying all AML laws are "immoral" comprise a ting fraction of 1% of the population.  Just because you seek out these people does not mean everyone thinks that way.  As usual, the only response from people like you is to try to censor the information and shoo people away.  You are a wing nut and a fool who will never win over the majority no matter how many stupid posts you make.
As for Etherium, I don't know what you are talking about.  The only comments I ever made about etherium are that people involved cannot come up with real world explanations about how these smart contracts will work.  I don't see the point of having a decentralized system that sits on top of centralized systems.  Face it, you are insane.  look at your web site, that says it all right there.

In 2013 I set up list of vendors selling food for Bitcoin.  In 2015 I updated the list and found about 1/3 no longer accepted Bitcoin.  There were a few new ones but not enough to make up for the ones who dropped out.  Meanwhile, some people are claiming "exponential growth" in the Bitcoin economy.  
The price tank comes because most of the people who do all this posting hardly buy anything with Bitcoin except maybe on Bitcoin Black friday.  The merchants will tell you it can be months between Bitcoin sales and most sales are on Black Friday.  under those circumstances the price tanks that day (or at least it did a couple years ago).

Vorhees claims the intent of the sponsors of the Bitlicense is to spy on people.  The actual intent was that Lawsky wanted to make a name for himself so he could have post-government employment.  His line of reasoning is almost always wrong on these issues because he does not understand what motivates the regulators.  As a result most of his arguments are flawed so he gets nowhere making his objections other than to get upvotes from circle-jerkers.  His political agenda is more important to him than advancing Bitcoin.  On the other hand Jerry Brito and Jim Harper provided much better arguments against it.  I worked for a regulatory agency for 27 years and lived in DC for 9 years.  You have to understand the motivations of your enemy before you fight battles and most of the prominent Bitcoiners have a lack of experience in those issues and they won't listen to anyone because they think that because they discovered Bitcoin that they know everything.  That Vorhees character has limited experience yet he goes around giving everyone "pro tips" with some arrogant smirk on his face.  I can't stand him.
@_date: 2016-06-14 23:43:43
It is not performing well as a currecy at all as it is still difficult to buy stuff directly with Bitcoin.  
As for the second sentence, it is really offensive how you try to twist the agenda thing.  As I have told you several times I could not care less about your kooky agenda.  the problem is that you misrepresent Bitcoin because you are promoting your agenda and not Bitcoin so you don't care about lying about things.  Bitcoin is not yet performing well as a currency and that needs to be fixed and pretending it is not true is not good.  In this case you would rather try to attack me with some kind of lie rather than state the real problem which is that generally businesses don't see a need yet to accept Bitcoin.  Instead of working on changing that you lust lie about it.  That is why I hate you and your agenda.  If you would promote your agenda in the proper place I would not care at all.  But you don't, you come to Bitcoin forums to promote your crap and pretend you are promoting Bitcoin.  I support an agenda of freedom.
You also go around giving people "pro tips" all the time when you have limited experience and knowledge (and I am sure you do it with your trademarked arrogant attitude).  That is another reason why I hate you and your attitude.
As for taking issue with Math, I have a master's degree in physics from Rutgers and you have a degree in political science from someplace called Puget Sound U.  I think I know a little more about math than you.  Your discussion has nothing to do with math, it is about lying about Bitcoin performing as a currency when you are discussing the commodity aspect.
I suggest you check out the Niskanen Foundation who recently appeared on Stossel.  they discussed how people like you are damaging the freedom movement by making poorly constructed arguments.

You kooks think because you post some link it somehow has merit.  The links you posted are complete nonsense and only some teenagers and a few mentally ill people agree with it.  I already explained the reasoning but you are a cultist so you will just go on forever posting your links and claiming you know everything.  I have read all those things and they make no sense as I have explained.  I have been following the people in Bitcoin who always post the links you post and I found them to completely ignorant people and I want no assertions with them.  It is embarrassing when people think I am associated with these kooks just because I am involved with Bitcoin.  You are just like fundamental religious people, you have firm beliefs that make no sense and there is no discussing logic.
@_date: 2016-06-11 12:04:11
I have made millions and I am retired.  What you are talking about is overregulation.  I never could have made all that money had it not been for a certain level of regulation.  You also don't misrepresent the motivation of having regulation in the first place (a common mistake made by Eric Vorhees every time he discusses this subject, such as the Bitlicense).  It is generally not designed to protect corporate interests but it often gets morphed into that when overregulation takes over.  It is all a matter of degree.

@_date: 2016-06-30 04:14:34
You are correct, there is not much incentive now to transfer into Bitcoin just to make a purchase.  You might find a merchant who gives a discount because they don't have the fees/chargeback expenses but you don't get the protection.  People on here often discuss things as if everyone has to use Bitcoin or at least wants to use Bitcoin.  The way to solve this is to increase the use of Bitcoin and the entire ecosystem so Bitcoin is cheaper to use.  However, most people don't focus on these issues as they are involved in endless conspiracy theories.  any attempt to make changes to make Bitcoin more usable is met with stiff resistance and claims it will destroy Bitcoin.  Some people on here actually claim that spending Bitcoin is bad because it the merchants will sell the coins and cause the price to tank (of course if people were using Bitcoin they would also be buying more coins but that concept seems to be lost on some people).  
I agree this is a huge problem but I don't know how to solve it given that any suggestion is met with censorship and conspiracy theories.  Look at the discussion on BIP 75 (this is an innocuous optional feature that allows for refund communications in a secure channel).  Major players in Bitcoin have come out against it with crazy claims that it is enforcing KYC and that is bad.   (while that is not true, even if it were, most people agree with some level of KYC given recent world events).  
The whole situation is currently untenable but hopefully it will change as more sensible people get involved in Bitcoin.

I am also the person who got the FinCEN ruling that US miners didn't have to register as money transmitters and I am the one who got the bogus BITCOIN trademark cancelled at the US patent and TM office.  Most of the cultists who complain don't do anything except complain about my posts and call me a statist.  Most of them hardly even use Bitcoin which is why you never see them post in threads where someone is selling something.  As the merchants how many of the rabid cultist posters actually buy anything.

I have read the things and those are the logical conclusions.  The people presenting the arguments know that is ridiculous so they try to dance around the obvious issues.  It is all total nonsense and it is not really worth discussing.  
I bet you also claim Bitcoin will end wars and all that "Bitcoin not Bombs" nonsense.   I had a public Bitcoin event one time and one guy wanted to start promoting that crap and I kicked him out and told him to get his own table.

None of your posts appear to come from an adult so it is unclear how you will judge the responses.  
I stopped reading once I see the term "statist."  All you want is a private club of like-minded weirdoes and you go around making fun of other people who know more than you and have accomplished more.  Going around offending people and calling them ignorant and stupid is no way to promote something for mass adoption.  These types of posts do nothing to advance Bitcoin.  It is just fodder for circle-jerkers. 
There certainly are models where you can have a permissioned blockchain without a token.  Those systems are completely different than Bitcoin and have a different purpose but that does not make it automatically wrong.  It is easy to spot a cultist when this subject comes up.  A real technologist or entrepreneur would come up with all types of scenarios where such a system might be used.  A cultist will sit around making fun of those people and claim their way is the one and only way.  That is because those "Bitcoin fundamentalists" see Bitcoin as a religion rather than a technology.  Whenever I see your posts I thing of the people who go to the wailing wall in Jerusalem.  
@_date: 2016-06-11 02:02:02
I already explain that an unregulated marketplace is just as problematic as an over-regulated marketplace.  
As for misinformation, listen to the archives Stephany Murphy of Let's Talk Bitcoin.   She has been claiming "exponential growth" for years when the increase in linear.  How about Roger Ver claiming Bitcoin will end wars with some screwball argument that government can no longer print money to fund wars as if that is the only thing they do.  Then there is Eric Vorhees who claims Bitcoin will replace the US dollar and people will flock to it like lifeboats when all the world's currencies collapse.  The technical limitations alone make that impossible as the developers often point out.  Then there those people at the Wackymoto "Foundation" who claim to know all of Satoshi's intentions from a few posts on Bitcointalk.  Then there are people who claim Bitcoin is faster, cheaper, etc. when in fact you trade off speed and expense for decentralization.  Then there are the blockchain people who claim everything can done via blockchain.  If you have a decentralized system sitting on top of a centralized system (like property ownership) then a court, for example, can change the ownership regardless of what some blockchain says.  Then there people who claim these DAO's will do all sorts of things when any company consists of people who live in jurisdictions and what it says on a blockchain doesn't matter.  Those are just a few of the examples where people distort Bitcoin because it fits their agenda.  When new people get involved in Bitcoin they hear all this nonsense, use it themselves, find out it is not true, and they drop out thinking all Bitcoiners are scammers.  I think Bitcoin is a great invention with many uses and I hate being associated with ignorant agenda pushers and scammers who spend all their time spreading misinformation.  
Nobody using the Internet is really "anti-statist" or they would not use it.  It is just buzzwords for circle-jerkers.

To a certain extent in some ways.  For the most part, no.  People want centralized banking services, including Bitcoiners who want things like Mt. Gox and Coinbase.  People also want loans, investments, etc. and Bitcoin cannot do that.
Bitcoiners also want government regulation backed by "violence" when it suits them which is why so  many Bitcoiners complain to authorities when their mining equipment doesn't get delivered.  Even Roger Ver filed lawsuits against other Bitcoiners such as Amir Taaki.  The stuff these people spew about a voluntary society is all a scam.  it is also a scam to claim Bitcoin can replace other financial instruments when all you can do is transfer value.

In the context of Bitcoin, which is not yet established, it is important to keep this distinction clear.  If this was the only issue then it would be nitpicking but it is the context of a massive amount of misinformation.  I only visit here every few weeks now and every time I do I can't believe the massive amount of misinformation.  I usually just latch onto one thing and once I see "Roger Ver" and "Eric Vorhees" in the same thread title I could not help but to respond.

That is just a straw man argument that is pointless.  Many things are better being done by the private sector but there are also many things that are not.  Both systems have their benefits and drawbacks and it is often a complex analysis which changes over time.  My opinion is that government should be reduced by about one third (not three thirds).  The problem is that it is next to impossible to end useless programs for political reasons and that is the crux of the problem.

Most of the people here are not legitimate Libertarians, they are kooks who make fun of legitimate Libertarians for not being extreme enough.  That market for them  is saturated as far as Bitcoin is concerned and it makes it difficult to expand to other potential markets.  It is somewhat like a large group of unruly teenagers who hang at the mall and drive most of the paying customers away.

Check in now and then.  Let's see, cringeworthy posts, cultist nonsense taken as fact, unemployed goofballs sitting around making fun of educated people and people with jobs, claims that some new feature will somehow solve the problem with adoption, pathetic offerings on the one-day-a-year Bitcoin shopping day.  I don't see much advancement and it is pretty boring.  It is still the case that almost nobody here focuses on Bitcoin's true advantages and use cases and they just ramble on about agenda-driven nonsense.    
@_date: 2016-11-07 16:43:30
That is fine, but post in your discussion boards that discuss those issues and have fun instead of trying to push the crap on everyone else by spamming discussion boards.  At any given time at least half the posts here are agenda spam that is only distantly associated with Bitcoin.

Oh, yes, all your "high-paying" fincen clients?  You mean the ones who would never hire you or give you a security clearance if they saw all the conspiracy theories you post?  Of course I don't have any high-paying clients, I already made enough so I don't have to work anymore. 
Actually I had quite a number of worthwhile things to say.  I am one who suggested the developers adopt a systems engineering approach to stop attention trolls like you from using reddit and Twitter to do your attention trolling in place of a scientific analysis.

Bitcoin is a great technology, why should I leave just because a few ignorant mouth-foaming cultists sit around posting agenda spam on reddit all day? 
@_date: 2016-11-07 16:18:33
Because the cultists distort the true value of Bitcoin.  If you talk to people who are not that familiar and think Bitcoin is bad you will find out the reasons are often associated with the fantasy political agenda many here try to attach to Bitcoin.  The problem is that most Bitcoiners discuss Bitcoin with other Bitcoiners and not the general population (which many here consider "sheeple").
@_date: 2016-11-07 18:35:40
Satoshi was involved in those things and they all have interesting points.  the problem comes with the extremists and ridiculous positions taken by many of the people you see post here.  he dropped out when he started getting into disputes with those people.
You cannot have capitalism without a set of rules that is enforced.  Anyone who was run a business knows that (yes, overregulation is a problem too).  I have thought all this through and looked at the discussions and I have come to the conclusion that the people calling themselves "anarcho-whatver" are a collection of ignorant people, weirdoes, mentally ill people, criminals, and cheaters who want to use all the infrastructure and then not pay their fair share.  they have no system or solutions, they have a collection of meme's, "fallacy" posts, and quotes about irrelevant stuff.

I worked for the federal government for 27 years, 9 years in DC.  Sure it is inefficient, but so is Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T, etc.  The problem with the government is that it is next to impossible to end useless programs.   However, in general people want the government services and they keep asking for more.
As for USPS, I can send a letter thousands of miles away for less than a dollar and it almost always gets there.  As for the DMV, just try to implement a similar program in the private sector and see what happens.  Even if you are correct it does not matter because people are not buying what you are selling.  I live in NJ and people want the government to swoop in with helicopters if they see a candy wrapper on the beach.

Another kook posting fallacy links again.  The idea I posted is not a fallacy, it is your analysis of what I said which is ignorant.  
Bitcoin adoption is about an ecosystem that includes merchant adoption, exchanges, use by consumer, use for money transfers and use for other related goods and services like Bitcoin 2.0 products.  
The cultists are the ones spreading misinformation because the Bitcoin that we have doesn't always fit their agenda so they lie.

Most of things have little or nothing to do with Bitcoin unless the world were to switch over Bitcoin and there is no basis for that.  The implication that it does is one reason why many Bitcoin agenda-pushers look ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:09:00
The political discussion is about how Bitcoin can be used, not what it is.  The problem comes in when the people involved in the political issues distort what Bitcoin is when it doesn't fit their political agenda.  That is why you see all sorts of misinformation on here, the Bitcoin wiki, etc.  People use Bitcoin for themselves and they see many of the things told to them were false and they end up dropping out and they think the whole thing is a scam.  
You can easily spot one these cultists because they will have some sort of story about how Satoshi agrees with them and they will have some complicated story on how the message in the genesis block "proves" all kinds of stuff that just happens to coincide with their agenda.  Ver claims to get hacked by the same hacker who attacked satoshi, satoshi Dice, satoshi roundtable, Satoshi as a founding member of the Foundation, etc. etc.  This is because the fantasy political agenda people are trying to push does not stand on its own merit so have to try to latch onto the reputation of people like satoshi.  It you listen to these people your are certain to come away with a distorted view of Bitcoin that does not match reality (such as "It breaks all the 20th century myths of money, banking, and the state"  LOL).  
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:15:30
You are coming off as a goofball teenager who likes to go around calling people stupid.  "those metals had no intrinsic value. Those metals may be used for other purposes, but gold was never the metal of choice because of its conductivity."  Those metals have intrinsic value because they can be used for other purposes.  like I said, you don't understand the definition of "intrinsic value" which means you can sell it for something even if the investment value goes to zero.  You also don't understand "decentralization" because the tokens cannot have intrinsic value while keeping the system decentralized.
You are one of the clueless moron cultist that goes around calling people stupid while having no clue what you are talking about.  All you do is repeat circle jerk nonsense without thinking about what you are actually saying.  Instead of taking the time to look up the definition and understanding an issue you just rant on with more postings.  I can't stand people like you.  All you do is make Bitcoiners look like a bunch of idiots and scammers.
I also have a master's in physics and I can tell you there is not much difference in conductivity of gold, silver, and copper.  The issue is mostly oxidation and corrosion as well as cost.

You are correct, Bitcoin has no agenda.  it is a technology.  Just like the telescope had no agenda to destroy religion when it was invented.  I wonder if anyone still thinks the telescope is a political/religious invention?

There is evidence that he had a dissatisfaction with centrally controlled systems.  I think most people feel that way when they deal with banks/governments etc.  it is unfortunate that many of the cultists are not satisfied with that as that is a great selling point for using Bitcoin.  Instead, they come up with all sorts of hyperbolic nonsense and conspiracy theories in an Alex Jones way and make the whole thing look ridiculous when it is, in fact, a very important invention.
My impression if that the main cause for Satoshi to drop out was because of these people distorting things.
@_date: 2016-11-07 16:50:53
What I did was set up a Bitcoin information table at a non-technology even.  people do discuss circumventing banks and they like that idea and they are confused by the technology.  However, many people also roll their eyes when the agenda topic comes up and many people have cited that as a reason they don't bother getting into it.  many people who did get into it for a short time because they were interested in the technology dropped out because of all the agenda stuff attached to it or because they found out the agenda pushers were giving them misinformation.  This is Bitcoin's biggest problem right now, keeping people interested.  I have even talked to people who worked for Bitcoin companies in the past and have completely dropped out of Bitcoin.  That would not happen except for the agenda pushers making Bitcoin distasteful.
@_date: 2016-11-07 16:40:31

@_date: 2016-11-07 20:44:49
Bitcoin is good under a very limited set of circumstances.  For most use cases it is not optimal at all.  You have an agenda and you lie about what Bitcoin can do because telling the truth won't fit with your agenda. For instance, Bitcoin has issues with fungibility because allegedly stolen or other tainted coins can be traced.   Bitcoin is "scarce" but anyone can start a new crypto anytime and people often buy into it so it doesn't solve that either. You can avoid the fed but you have to deal with a tiny group of developers so it just transfers the problems to a different entity.  the list goes on and on.  Not that Bitcoin cannot solve some problems but it is not some panacea that the cultists claim.  Anyone who uses Bitcoin even now and then can see many of the claims you see posted here daily are completely false yet they still get upvoted.  In some cases the developers say stuff is nonsense but people just keep posting the same cultist drivel over and over as if posting it thousands of times will make it true.
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:31:42
In Bitcoin there is a great example which is the interview of Preston Byrne on let's Talk Bitcoin.  Preston is a legitimate libertarian who was harassed by many Bitcoiners and one Bitcoiner said hhe should be hanged for not being libertarian enough.
A general example is the Niskanen Foundation who are legitimate Libertarians.  they recently appeared on Stossel to discuss how the extremists drive many people away from liberty movements by presenting poorly constructed arguments.  the discussion wasn't specifically about Bitcoin but the ideas he discussed applies to many of the people posting here.

If that were true then Bitcoin would be much more widely adopted by now.

It is too bad because it takes away from the true benefits of Bitcoin.

Actually I am buying back the coins I sold when the cultists claimed that Bitcoin can be used now as a replacement currency  and store of value for Greeks.  Now I bought them back when these "bitcoin is splitting" stories come out.  
I will tell anyone that Bitcoin has some great use cases but it is designed for decentralization, not a replacement for other types of financial instruments.  I also think these developer disputes will work out.  If people want to flip out anyway and cause the price to change I am going to profit from it.

Yes, according to Coinbase.  they showed a list of a large number of signups and a small number completed the link to a bank account and the $100 min purchase.  Since they were links from banner ads I have no way of knowing who signed up or how many.  Coinbase would still not pay automatically on the ones they claimed to have followed the guidelines in about 50% of the cases.  Once I argued with them they finally paid but I had to go to several support personnel and I had to put up insinuations that I was trying to scam them over $5.

As I understand it ... lightning depends on trusting the other party to do things while you are communicating within a channel.

The document is not a formal road map and it is lacking many areas.  If makes the developers look very amateurish to constantly call that document a formal roadmap.  If someone wants to turn whatever document they have into a formal road then I can help as I did it for years.  If you want to claim something about "risks" then you need risk tables first and Bitcoin has none and that, along with standard definitions.  This is the first thing you do before developing a "road map."
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:17:26
The real world means things like the regulatory infrastructure, intellectual property, the needs and desires of the average consumer.  The notion that Bitcoin is immune to political and commercial influence has no basis in reality as can be seen by things like block size debate.  You are really just replacing one political system with another.  However, in this case you have Bitcoiners who lack experience in all these areas.  Basically many go around saying the system is no good but they don't even understand the system to begin with.  You can't change the world if you don't understand it.
@_date: 2016-02-12 20:32:51
While Hearn did not handle some situations well his analysis of the Bitcoin market and ecosystem is much more accurate than the things I hear from the people you hang with.  It is a shame that people with reasonable opinions get pushed out while unreasonable wing nuts are lauded as heroes.  That is why Bitcoin adoption is so slow and why some major players have dropped out.  the wing nut market is saturated as far as Bitcoin is concerned and the only way to bring in new people is to have a reasonable approach.

If you don't like your politician you can vote them out, you can move to a different country, you can use barter other than fiat, etc.  I don't see that as a major differentiator.  
Also, the number of shops accepting Bitcoin is related to the value of the coin so you can't separate those two issues.  
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:22:55
By "roadmap" I mean a roadmap for the technology.  For example, a high level goals could be to increase capacity while preserving decentralization.  First you need to come up with standard definitions of "decentralization" and "capacity" (both of those definitions are somewhat complicated and significant work would need to be done just to do that).  
Then you really need risk tables.  Jim harper started to that for the Foundation but that would have to greatly expanded to fit the software development issues here (again, a lot of work).
Then the roadmap would include alternatives such as SegWit, increased block size, etc.  So the roadmap could have more than one path (alternatives).  Each of these alternative has to have companion risk charts done in a somewhat standard way so they can be compared by nonexperts.  
Here is more info on the risk section that discusses advantages and drawbacks:

All you ever do is respond with petty excuses.  
-You attacked Coin Center a few days ago on Reddit instead of Twitter.  
-Being subject to regulation is not the same thing as understanding regulators and how they operate.  
-I have seen regulators in action and it is clear you have no clue how they operate and you are completely ignorant to the whole ecosystem. 
-Your Facebook page accuses millions of people (including myself) involved in government of being murders and you warn people that they have to watch out or they will be murdered by us.
-Andreas is cultist looking for attention and I don't care what he says.  
-People who don't agree with your extreme nut case position are not all "pro regulation."
-The EFF has not focused on Bitcoin or the surrounding issues and they work with Coin Center, they do not attack them like you do.  You are using the EFF to promote your agenda just like you use Bitcoin.  
-The Bitcoin Foundation has a strong political leaning that coincides with your small group of associates such as Ver and Vorhees.  Bitcoin promotion is essentially nonexistent at this point and you are putting in your personal funds so you can use the Foundation to promote your personal agenda.  
@_date: 2016-02-25 23:46:20
Huh?  All they do is say there is a problem with government so The "state must be destroyed."  Vorhees goes around saying "I don't worship the State."  Fenton goes around telling people they are more likely to be killed by their government (which implies. apparently, that it should be eliminated).  What kind of weirdo stuff is that?  They want all the benefits of society but the minute something goes wrong for them they want everything destroyed and they imply that everyone associated with normal society is some kind of criminal.  These people are totally ignorant wing nuts and I want no association with these people.

Financial professionals went to school for that and they run a business.  They generally know much more about the financial system than most of the people who post here.  While Bitcoiners may be able to present some new ideas they have a large learning curve to be able to discuss things on their level.  If you want to be a success at Bitcoin then absorb as much information as you can from those professionals.  Then use that information to improve Bitcoin.  If you go in and say "you are all stupid and I have all the answers" then you will get nowhere.

Many people here confuse what Bitcoin "is" with how it can be used.  Bitcoin is bits and bytes which is not political at all.  Bitcoin can be used for all sorts of political purposes but that is not what it is.  
The telescope was highly political when it was invented but nobody considers it to be political today.  the telescope has not changed, only people's perspective of it has changed.   
Mike Hearn is a technologist and when he presented a technology issue he did so without regard to the political issues.  some Bitcoiners who live their life promoting some political agenda suddenly get appalled at some of his ideas because the technology did not happen to fit into their political ideology.  
Most people want laws on how money is spent if they think it will result in greater security (maybe it will and maybe it won't but that is what people want).  The same can be seen in the world of privacy.  Privacy advocates claim people want privacy but the reality is privacy policies are some of the least read pages on the web.  people generally only care after an incident.  You need to get educated on what people actually think rather than claiming what people should think.

The protocol is different than the type of coin.  You can have multiple coins using the same protocol.  You have all sorts of different types of web sites that sit on top of tcp/ip.  while many people use the Google web site it is not the only system used.  
As for money and financial instruments, this Bitcoin experiment shows people want variety as they constantly put value on things other than Bitcoin such as ETH, Dash, etc., etc.  The trend is for people to use different systems depending on their need.  
People get into these circle jerks and they start making faulty arguments that Bitcoin will be the "one and only" in spite of glaring evidence that shows that is not the case.  I think the systems will be permanently in a state of flux with new systems forming and old system going out of style.  If you take this opinion as some sort of "attack" on Bitcoin then you should probably step back and think about it.  I think that situation is good for crypto and it is the natural evolution of these systems.

No you don't understand everything you think you understand and your message is hyperbolic.  Lobbying is a complicated process and from what I have seen Brito does a good job.  As for the organizations giving him money they generally have an understanding what he is doing as I am sure they are not just blindly throwing him money.  In any case, it is their money.

My experience with Coinbase affiliate program:
-You must argue with customer service for almost every payment.
-At least 2 customer reps accused me of trying to scam them for $5 after I have done hundreds of thousands in transactions with them.
-They keep asking you the identity and e-mail address of the people who sign up even though they were told it was a banner at a web page someone clicked and there is no way to know that info.
-They violate the privacy of the people who sign up by sending you their email address.  
-No matter how far up you go in the chain of management they never fix all the problems associated with the affiliate program or provide any kind of reasonable reply.

The Foundation should promote Bitcoin which means they should be agnostic on political issues because there are many, many people different perspectives.  The small group you hang with represents a tiny fraction of the people who could potentially use Bitcoin.  Linking Bitcoin with a radical political position that most people will never agree with is detrimental to the promotion of the Bitcoin technology.  You claim this is not true because you only associate with people within that small group and you don't care about anyone else.  
As for Coin Center, I have seen your stuff and I have seen Coin Center presentation.  It is clear to me that you have no clue how regulators works and Jerry Brito is very experienced.  Every time I see you mention Coin Center you are attacking them and claiming they were wrong.  That includes a few days ago where you attacked his tweets claiming he is wrong.  It is clear to me you are the one who is wrong but you have to stick your nose in to try to get yourself noticed.  If you were really promoting Bitcoin you would keep quiet but you are not promoting Bitcoin, you are promoting your political agenda.  
What it all boils down to is that I want to involved in Bitcoin and I invest in it but I want nothing to do with you and your little inner circle.  You treat Bitcoin like a political party and I treat it like a technology.  There are many people like me and you are trying to shut us out from Bitcoin.  People like Vorhees who go around taunting people with his arrogant little smirk are really offensive to many people.

There has never been a formal roadmap developed.  There are various emails and blog posts but none of them come close to a formal roadmap.  A formal roadmap has things like a scope, time horizon, risk tables, alternatives, test data, etc.  Many people who like to promote an agenda and spread a lot of misinformation don't want any formal documents because it will cramp their style of turning these things into a political football instead of a technical analysis.

I would never associate it with a technology such as Bitcoin because the technology is not about promoting a political stance, it is about technology.

It is like saying the Internet is associated with some political stance and if you use the Internet then you must agree with that stance.

Yes, there are many problems that need to be fixed.  However, people like Fenton and Vorhees offer no solutions, they just respond with some ignorant nonsense that results in insulting the vast majority of the population.

You lose me one you mix political agendas with computer code.  Computer code has no politics, how people use it may be politically motivated but that is not what it is.  This is why Hearn had so much difficulty dealing with the Bitcoin crowd.  he is a technologist and he looked at things in terms of bits and bytes whereas many Bitcoiners look at things from the point of view of their political agenda.  
The people who look at Bitcoin from the point of view of their political agenda are like religious fundamentalists.  There is no point in trying to engage in a technical discussion with them because they don't look at the issues rationally.

It is a combination of things.  gold is desirable for its properties for jewelry and conductivity.  Many people have adopted it as a store of value and people trade it.  Because people do all those things it maintains a value level.  Bitcoin does not have the same intrinsic value as gold.  One way Bitcoin has value is that it can be easily transacted over the Internet.  if that property is not used that much then Bitcoin's price will fall.  if people stopped using gold for jewelry and electronics then its price would also drop.  Further, gold is no longer generally used as a currency but Bitcoin was designed to be an Internet currency so you are comparing different things.

I don't see it that way.  The fact I invest much less than I other would because I don't trust the judgment of some the people involved such as yourself.
As for your revisionist history of the Bitclicense I don't agree with what you say.  Also, from what you say it is clear you don't have a reasonable understanding of regulators and Brito does.  in any case if you were actually promoting Bitcoin as you claim you would stay pretty much neutral.  You don't do that which is why I don't want to be associated with your activities.
Your numerous Internet posting are somewhat similar to sacrificing goats as I see it.  You come off as incredibly ignorant and someone I would never associate with.

I imagine Satoshi as a computer scientist who solved a problem and imagined how it could be used to circumvent middlemen.  Certain other groups with certain agendas want to use Bitcoin for various purposes such as pursuing various political agendas.  Those groups have goals but that is not the same things as the goal of Bitcoin itself.  Many of the people with an agenda want it to be that way to try to make their agenda sound more important.  As time goes by more and more people seem to claim Bitcoin was invented for the purpose they want to use it for.

You always pretend it does not matter and I find that strange.  Several people have expressed displeasure with those issues both publicly and privately to me.  One attorney said he cringed when he heard you chosen to head up the Foundation.  Whether your views are more or less radical than political candidates is really a ridiculous point to make and a poor excuse.
You like to see yourself as part of some sort of exclusive club.  Vorhees is the same way.  He has some crappy degree from a crappy university and he goes around acting like he is some kind of expert and acts all arrogant all the time.  Promoting Bitcoin for mass adoption is the opposite of creating an exclusive club.
Every public message I see from you about Coin Center is attacking them.  Just because you pretended to make nice when you met him doesn't mean much.  You attack them because your political agenda is more important to you than the success of Bitcoin.  Why don't you just run an organization to promote your political agenda?
@_date: 2016-02-25 02:08:33
I don't believe it is the same thing.  Silk Road was an overall conspiracy and it did not depend on a Bitcoin transaction to be entered into evidence.  You would need to sift through all the court documents to see how it was handled.  I suspect the transactions were not contested.
Think of a case where person A pays person B a Bitcoin to satisfy a debt.  Person A says "I paid" and here is the blockchain evidence ("Bitcoin receipt").  Person B says "I was never paid" and objects to the blockchain evidence being entered into the record.

This is coming from a guy who posts inflammatory stuff all over the Internet calling all government employees murderers and claiming you have a higher probably of being killed by the government than any other way. Bitcoin will not advance as long as wing nuts like Bruce Fenton have prominent positions in Bitcoin. 
His actions over at the Foundations are very telling. They place an emphasis on promoting wing nut positions with their tweets but you don't hear anything about promoting Bitcoin to merchants and consumers or educational programs. I had put together a proposal to develop some educational videos back when they had the grant program and I even made the Bitcoin.me video. I never heard back from the Foundation about it. 
He doesn't care about Bitcoin nearly as much as his wing nut political agenda. All he does is set up secret meetings with his buddies while ignoring the bulk of the potential Bitcoin users.

there is a metric and I explained it.  Eric Vorhees has no experience or clue about how the regulatory system operates or how it works.

I have seen several of his talks.  He is generally much better than the people that post here but his talks still leave much to be desired.  For instance, his testimony in Canada plays well here but not so much to people who have experience.  I have also seen his emotions get away with him and claim specific miners could be kicked off the network.  So yes, at times he is reckless and he sometimes lets his political agenda get in the way of facts.  
The point is he has a lot to learn from financial professionals and going around calling them stupid is not only false but it damages the reputation of Bitcoin.

The vast majority of Bitcoiners don't understand that either.  For instance, the incentive to hire developers is to affect the software to make a profit.  Many Bitcoiners are continually shocked by this even though it has always been that way.  Many Bitcoiners talk as if it is either fiat currency or Bitcoin and they hardly address the case that both will exist simultaneously.  Maybe the financial professionals don't have good understanding but Bitcoiners are probably worse off.  The more important Bitcoin gets then those groups are going to get more involved and they will be hiring developers to promote their agenda.  Even if you don't like it you should at least expect it and not be surprised.
To see how little we all understand how this works just try to predict what will happen during the halving.  The price?  The mining ecosystem?  See how many different answers you get.

I look at his videos and blog posts.  I am not expert and I only did part time but I used to testify at some of these things about Internet privacy back in the late 90's.  During that time I worked a federal job in DC.  I at least have some idea how regulators and regulations work.  It is clear to me that he has a deep understanding of how the system works and how to work the system to Bitcoin's benefit.  
By contrast watching people like Andreas testify it is clear he is speaking to Bitcoiners and not the regulators.  While that plays well here among Bitcoiners it does not play as well from the perspective of the regulators and does not "advance the ball."  If you want to change the world you need to understand it first and Brito has a much better understanding than the vast majority of Bitcoiners.

I don't agree with everything in the article but this is how regular people view many of the ideas that are bandied about in this forum.  People here greatly exaggerate what Bitcoin can do.  Outsiders look at the obvious flaws in the arguments and dismiss the whole thing out of hand before they fully understand it.  Many people on here are completely oblivious to this and just go around saying "they don't get it" or claim people who raise the issue work for JPMorgan and are part of some conspiracy to damage Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:31:02
Just because I point out similarities of the Bitcoin world and the fed does not mean I support one or the other.  The question is about whether the Bitcoin system is fundamentally different than the Fed.  After watching the block size debate I am getting more convinced there is much less difference than people think.
Adoption levels clearly affect the price which is also true of Gold.  Bitcoin is a different animal than Gold and merchant acceptance is a major issue in maintaining and increasing the exchange rate.  It is amazing to me that Bitcoiners think differently.  Some even claim that creating a Bitcoin economy where people spend Bitcoins will "cause the price to tank."  That is true if people only buys stuff on Black Friday maybe but it is certainly not true in general.

It is like inventing cable TV with hundreds of channels and then claiming people will all watch one channel in the end.  That is just wishful thinking from overenthusiastic advocates.

I bet you have no clue what positions I hold.  I am against the ignorant people that try to misrepresent Bitcoin for their own purposes.  This includes the people who distort Bitcoin because they are promoting some non-starter political agenda.  I listen to people like jerry Brito at Coin Center and Tim Swanson and other people who treat Bitcoin like the technology that it is.  Preston Byrne is a reasonable libertarian and Bitcoin advocate.
You are incorrect that we are all getting the value out of our participation.  The kooks spreading all the nonsense have severely damaged the Bitcoin market and made it very difficult to bring new people in.  This can be seen by the slow adoption.  People on here are so involved in their little world of circle jerking they fail to realize what is happening in the rest of the world.  In fact many of these people think they are promoting Bitcoin and brining new people in when they are really making the whole thing look ridiculous.  "bankers are stupid"  "the government is terrified"  "Bitcoin will end wars"  I mean, c'mon, how ridiculous can it get?  Bitcoin is a solid technology that stands on its own without adding all this nonsense.

@_date: 2016-02-26 01:12:43
The issue I have is that try to claim what Bitcoin is and imply that everyone who uses Bitcoin agrees with them.  They try to claim Satoshi agrees with them and the purpose of Bitcoin is aligned with their political agenda.  Then, when something doesn't align with their agenda, they misrepresent Bitcoin to fit their needs.  
For example, Bitcoin is tradeoff.  To get decentralization you have to have all this mining expense and you have to wait for the network to come to a consensus over the state of the blockchain.  You really need to make a business case why decentralization is needed and in many cases the answer is that centralized systems work better.  The agenda pushers come in and claim everything is better, faster, cheaper, and "everything should be decentralized."  There is absolutely no basis for that except they want to push their political agenda.   They create false expectations and they make all Bitcoiners look ridiculous.  The worst of all is the people who go around claiming Bitcoin will end wars.  I mean how ridiculous can you get? 
Bitcoin is a tool that expends the capability of what is there now.  It has some very interesting use cases.  It may disrupt some business models and force the hands of some regulators.  However, the notion that governments and financial institutions will "collapse" is ridiculous.  Now some people measure the success of Bitcoin based on whether it will become the world's reserve currency.   
There are too many people in Bitcoin with too much power who promote this type of nonsense and it is stunting adoption.  People don't want to be associated with those extreme positions and they dismiss Bitcoin before they understand it.

That is correct.  Bitcoin advocates promote Bitcoin for trustless transactions and it has some interesting use cases but it can be used by anyone for a variety of purposes.  Bitcoin fundamentalists believe Bitcoin can replace the financial system, collapse financial institutions/governments, and end wars and that Bitcoin should be used only for specific purposes that fit their beliefs.  See the difference?

I worked for the FAA for 27 years, I lived in DC for 9 years while I ran a company on side.  In my spare time I testified before regulatory bodies such as the FTC and I sat on panels with the EFF.  I testified on Internet privacy and I used to sue companies for violating privacy laws.  From my experience I can say that Jerry Brito knows what he is doing and you have no clue.
I can safely say that pilots don't understand the FAA regulatory ecosystem at headquarters.  In fact it has been discussed many times in meetings that to understand the FAA HQ ecosystem takes 25 years or longer!  (Not a typo)
I am not aware of Thomas Massy going around telling people they are more likely to be killed by their government than any other way.  Millions of people do not agree with that.  There are millions of people who disagree with that and find it insulting.  Further, that position has nothing to do with promoting the Bitcoin technology.  You are purposely making enemies because your political agenda is more important to you than promoting the Bitcoin technology.
You just attacked Coin Center a few days when you complained about Brito's tweet and claimed he was wrong.  You attack Coin Center at every opportunity.  As a result I am going to attack you and the Foundation every chance I get.  I think that is the limit of our common ground.  You don't listen to anything and just repeat your agenda pushing nonsense.  Go join politics if you want to run around spouting off offensive comments and making enemies, don't screw with my investments so you can promote your kooky agenda in the name of Bitcoin.

the issue that linking Bitcoin to extreme political positions and making exaggerated claims about what it can do is detrimental to mass adoption.  I don't think the author fully understands all the issues but the point is the initial impression of Bitcoin was not good.  Now the author must be educated but they are coming from an initial position of skepticism so it will be harder.
@_date: 2016-02-24 02:06:10
Of course it is a good thing.  It means there is greater  interest in Bitcoin.  Are you upset because Bitcoin will no longer be a private club for wing nuts?    
@_date: 2016-02-29 01:21:30
That is complicated.  It is easy to say money transfers but it really depends on your specific situation and whether the Bitcoins can be obtained and liquidated easily.  Micropayments as well.  For instance, I don't care about decentralized micropayments in general, I am fine with sending $25 to changetip for them to hold.  Decentralization is only important if I want to send payments to something changetip does not serve.  Most credit card transaction I want to keep the chargeback rights but in certain situations Bitcoin is fine, such as a place I trust.  For instance there is a business case for a service like gyft where they save on transaction fees and they pass part of the savings onto the consumer.  That does not mean I would do a Bitcoin transaction with some company I never heard of.
Now if I lived in a country where I don't have all these financial tools the business case for Bitcoin is different.

Yes, but those business cases are much narrower than many people on here claim. For instance, I don't really need decentralized micropayments.  Maybe people in other parts of the world who don't have the banking infrastructure have a business case but I don't.  A good business case may be avoiding middleman fees like Western Union.  
There is certainly no business case for Bitcoin to be a reserve currency or ubiquitous currency given the confirmation times.   I know the usual answer to that is Lightning network and similar things but all that does, after all that complication, is just get me back to where I am now with fiat currency.

Bitcoin was designed to offer trustless transactions which are expensive and slow as compared to other systems and it is only applicable when there is a need for decentralization.  The constraint that you have to wait for the network to come to consensus over the state of the blockchain limits the viable use cases.   You cannot promote Bitcoin with unrealistic use cases and expect people to use it.  You also cannot take a position that the banks are stupid, the government is terrified, and everybody is "sheeple" (except for few "elite" Bitcoiners who know everything) if you expect mass adoption.

@_date: 2016-02-27 00:13:38
If there is a business case to use it yes.  Going around saying "everything should be decentralized" is not a business case.  Mining is expensive and once the block rewards go way down the users will need to pay the freight for security.  As for developer incentives, whoever pays them gets to influence the software.   When it is all said and done I am not really sure how different the system is the current system like central banks.  I think it may have some advantages in some cases but it is not the panacea some people on here claim.  
@_date: 2016-02-25 02:48:25

Some parts of Armory development are not going to continue.  from what I understand the free version will still be supported and the software is still available.

You have a set of requirements and then you propose alternatives given those requirements.  Listing requirements is another part of the task that I didn't mention.   I would not have the knowledge to do those lists of requirements, risks, definitions, and alternatives.  No one person would.  The only way to do it is to have the technical experts cooperate on those things.  They do many of those tasks now to an extent but it is done in a disjointed way.  It is actually for their benefit since it will save a lot of time in the long run.  I could contribute by steering people to the standard processes that have been developed by places like INCOSE.

As many Bitcoins can be created as people decide to create.  but that is not really important, what is important is that people put value into other systems almost as fast as people can create them so if you look at cryptocurrencies as a whole it does not really change much.  the 21 million limit is only meaningful if people use Bitcoin and only bitcoin and that doesn't look like that will ever happen.  as for issues with the fed, etc., sure, there are issues/problems with any system.  If you look at Bitcoin and things like the block size debate and you see the same sorts of problems as the fed but they just manifest themselves in a different way.  The reality is Bitcoin is just a choice among many financial instruments and it is not going to affect the existence of the fed one way or the other.  Only the wing nuts want to try to create some kind of choice or an "us vs. them" mentality.  It is just agenda spam to try to insert all these issues into a Bitcoin discussion.

(of course it has the whole spectrum since they employ millions of people when you include contractors).  The public generally asks for government to be larger and do more things.  You don't understand anything about government, what it does, who it employs, or what the public at-large wants from it.  All you know is stupid crap you read on Reddit posted by idiots who also have no clue.  Not that there are not many problems and issues, but you don't understand what those problems are which is why you will never have any solutions.

The developers are following the incentive system in place from day 1.  Bitcoin was intended to provide trustless transactions and it already does that so anything beyond that is something you want Bitcoin to do.  The incentive system in place is that if you want something you pay the developers to do it.  That is not corruption.  The developers are not obligated to people that don't pay them.  In fact if they are being paid by someone and they decide on their own to do something you want instead then that would be corruption.

Decentralization is an interesting tool for certain situations and I am all for it.  It gives people another choice in addition to what is there now.  You are young and you don't understand the intricacies for the world nor do you understand what people want.  I worked for the federal government for 27 years and I can say with absolute certainty that people like you have no clue whatsoever how government actually works.  Not that it is all good, or that I support it 100%, or that I don't think that major changes are needed but people like you have no answers ... you just have meme's.
As for Bitcoin, it is an experiment.  It is showing that while decentralization works very well in some cases it is not suitable for many real world situations.  Things like the blocksize debate and the Ethereum rollback show decentralization is just another imperfect system.  it is an improvement to have an additional tool but it is not some panacea that will solve all the problems of society. 
You don't know who is laughing at AA because you spend your life in a circle jerk.

The problem I have is the kooks who have spun up decentralization into some kind of religion that is supposed to validate some fantasy kook agenda that has little or nothing to do with Bitcoin.  It is the stuff you hear on Alex Jones.  That is just ignorant and I don't want to be associated with the cult end of it.

LOL.. Maybe YOUR utopian future.  Bitcoin is a tool that does certain things but it is not a replacement for all things.  These kind of statement make Bitcoiners look just as bad as Dimon saying it is a fraud.  The truth is somewhere in the middle of it being a fraud and replacing the US dollar. 
I think there is no question that Bitcoin will not the "one and only" for all time.  There will be an evolution of cryptos so they will go up in value and eventually go down and be replaced by something better since it next to impossible to make major changes to a consensus system.  So there will be a "top" at some point.  The arguments you make over "inflation" are not relevant because new cryptos are created all the time and people give them value.  That argument is only valid in a fantasy world where Bitcoin is the only crypto.  Bitcoins value is that it gives people the ability to do trustless transactions.  All these claims about replacing the dollar and inflation issues just divert people's attention away from Bitcoin's true value.  People outside of Bitcoin read all those nonsense claims and that is why they think it is a scam.

Next, the extremist title in your posting is your usual hyperbole.  the truth is people should be very careful about web wallets but I use them all the time.

I am surprised at the increase in exchange rate but I am equally surprised in the lack of performance in other areas.  The notion that because the exchange rate has done well that this somehow makes everything else Bitcoiners claim is misguided.  It is unfortunate that Bitcoiners can't focus of the true value of Bitcoin but instead make all sorts of faulty arguments that it will replace everything.

The idea of ripple predated Bitcoin.  Mike Hearn, for instance, has stated he got involved in the Ripple concept before Bitcoin.  
The idea of Ripple is to have a platform to exchange any type of currency, commodity, or whatever.  The problem is if they took a transaction fee directly the company setting up Ripple would need to be licensed in every jurisdiction in the world.  Instead they created the Ripple currency XRP that get "destroyed" when a transaction takes places.  In order for the company to collect these tx fees in a roundabout way they keep some Ripples for themselves and sell them.
Instead of trusting mining you are trusting gateways which can be things such as a bank, a Bitcoin exchange, or you can trust someone you know.  The idea is that if someone in can trade Euros for US dollars very easily via Ripple there is no need for each party to get some universal currency like Bitcoin.  The theory is that, at least for some use cases involving Bitcoin as a payment system, Bitcoin is not needed.  The issues are generally that Ripple is not decentralized and the store of value is also not the same as Bitcoin so it really only competes with Bitcoin in certain use cases.

I don't know what you are saying.  I didn't mention testing or scaling, I mentioned risk analysis and systems engineering.  Of course that process takes into consideration random failures and malicious actors.  I don't know what you are talking about by saying Bitcoin is "security software."  There is whole branch of system engineering specifically for software.
Since you brought up testing system engineer includes things like tests plans as part of the process.  Risk analysis is a living document that identifies risks and likelihood so when changes are proposed they are done in systematic way and then tested in a standard way.

Most of the developers have that same attitude.  They protect their turf and they don't like it when outsiders try to bring up issues they don't agree with.  In order to get software projects completed they have to be that way to a certain extent.  The problem comes in when political issues arise they don't want to hear from people outside the inner circle.
They have done things such as delete messages from Github, chastised people for "hiding behind anonymity" when the whole project is based on an anonymous contributor, used Twitter to try to turn complex issues into one-liners to stifle debate, and I have seen Mike Hearn come right out and tell people to go hire their own developers if they didn't like what he was doing at the Foundation.  They seem to miss the point that mass adoption depends on bringing large numbers in with diverse issues. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 20:02:34
My comment is not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing, it is about debating the issues.  First of all, open source is not the same as decentralization so saying something as open source does not automatically make it decentralized.  How decentralized it is or isn't is a complicated discussion that takes paragraphs.  Decentralization is a continuum and the only thing truly decentralized in Bitcoin is the consensus over the blockchain which is a slow and expensive process and requires mining.    
Paying the bulk of the developers is a chokepoint.  How much of a chokepoint and control is a matter for discussion since there are many checks and balances but it clearly has an effect.  Otherwise, why would people put so much effort into lobbying the developers to do things?  I am against Twitter one-liners or labeling the discussion as a "conspiracy theory" as a way of shutting down legitimate discussion.

With the new system of "headers first" for the blockchain download using the core client are the checkpoints still needed?
The "checkpoints" are is hardcoded checkpoints of the blockchain in the Core client.  They are a few months behind.  They are there to prevent someone from feeding you an incorrect chain and preventing you from downloading the proper blockchain.  It is easy to create an incorrect chain when the difficulty was very low so a bad node could send you down a "wild goose chase" by starting to download a chain that will eventually be invalid.  The problem is the checkpoints circumvent the "proof of work" and allow the developers to choose the "correct" chain at least up to the checkpoint.  The developers generally don't like the checkpoints and some people have said they can now be removed with the "headers first" system.

I am not sure what Coinbase does but some exchanges send funds from a shared wallet.  For places that do that (and do not use BIP70) if a merchant tries to send a refund it goes to the shared wallet and not into your account.  Some places also use batch processing or a delay due to security checks and when that is done it could cause the invoice to time out.  
If the merchant also uses the same service then the transaction is normally done "off blockchain" and the service just transfers the funds internally and the payment is instant but the service could potentially reverse it.

@_date: 2015-04-15 11:30:19
I think you need to dwell on the past so the Foundation does not keep making the same mistakes over and over.  
First, the Foundation needs to set reasonable standards.  their logo should not be used to promote things like Mt. Gox and Inputs.io.  Emergency altert keys should not be issued to Theymos so he can use it like a badge of honor to promote questionable software projects.  There is no quality control over the brand.  
Second (this is meant to you personally) the Bitcoin Foundation is about Bitcoin and not some fantasy political agenda.  You endlessly promote people like Erik Vorhees who uses Bitcoin to promote and agenda that has no hope of ever being accepted by most Bitcoin users.   The theory is that once people start using Bitcoin that people then automatically agree with the whole agenda.  That is delusional.  Just because someone completes a Bitcoin tx does not mean they are going walk around with Ayn Rand books under their arm.  If someone wants to use Bitcoin to promote an agenda that is find but that is not what Bitcoin is and it is not what the Foundation should be promoting.  Many users want nothing to do with people who around talking about how Bitcoin will end wars, replace the US Dollar, and collapse governments.  This type of agenda does not stand on its own merit which is why many use (distort) Bitcoin to try to gain publicity for their cause.  
Someone from the Foundation's education committee tried to claim that because they would accept input from anyone that the education committee was "decentralized."  I found it shocking that someone on the education committee doesn't even understand decentralization and that the blog post was posted at the Foundation's web site without anyone saying anything.  If decentralization was simply putting up a web site and accepting comments from people then all those mining computers would be a waste.

From what I read this has to do with automatically converting Bitcoin into a government fiat currency.  Hence, it is considered a money "substitute."  If you had a company that had sales in Bitcoin and paid most of the salaries and expenses then you can say it is no longer a money "substitute" and then Bitcoin can be considered a currency rather than property.  I would like to hear from experts if they think this is a correct understanding.

Yes, and there are many systems that have the same issues and many people studying similar problems.  You identify a set of risks and you assign them rank based on likelihood and effect.  Then you develop mitigation strategies.  Those strategies are developed in the context of how it affects overall risk.  Right now these issues are often dealt with by "wars" on twitter/github/blogs and are sometimes based on personalities rather than facts.  A system engineering process provides a framework to deal with issues rather than the whack-a-mole process that you often see in Bitcoin.

As for they Theymos thing, it was in a Reddit discussion about Theymos spending $100K per month to develop new forum software.  He claimed during that thread that he must be trustworthy since he was issued the emergency alert key.  I complained to the Foundation about this and the Foundation told me I was wasting their time by complaining about it.  Maybe a fork should be done that eliminates the functionality of the key since it is being used for improper purposes?   They key is supposed to be for sending emergency messages, not as a badge of honor so people can use it as part of their resume to promote schemes.

The miners rewards are also tied to the exchange rate so for that reason you can't predict if the hash rate will go up or down.  There is also advances with the technology so that also causes the hash rate to increase.  If miners get incorporated into devices that need to produce heat that is another way it could increase.  
As for the question in the title I think that is one of the biggest unanswered questions of the experimental phase of Bitcoin.  It is also hard to judge "properly secured" because you don't really know how much you need until someone attacks the system.
@_date: 2015-04-15 12:23:42
That sounds good but keep in mind that the anarcho-whatever market is saturated as far as Bitcoin is concerned.  If you want to bring in new people you have to understand that the political views of Erik, Roger, etc. will be seen as ridiculous, crazy, childish, naïve, etc. and are generally a negative if those ideas are associated with Bitcoin use.  I agree with some Libertarian views and the basic issues that government is too large and liberty is being eroded but the extreme views displayed by some of your associates are just completely unreasonable and unworkable.  Jerry Brito, Tim Swanson, and Preston Byrne all make sense to me but many of the Bitcoin cultists do not.
Those people all use US Dollars but that does not mean they agree with the policies and agendas of the US government and the same goes for Bitcoin.  People will use Bitcoin if it is useful, not because it promotes some agenda.

This type of stuff was pretty obvious from the beginning.  Patrick Murck has always been against transparency and he fought the idea of releasing meeting minutes when I brought up the issue in early 2013 so I never joined.
There is also the issue of the risk analysis and developing the software using a formal systems engineering process.  The current developers just ignore the issue and shut people out there too.  Github is handled the same way.  Many of the devlopers understand Bitcoin but they have little understanding of things outside of that.  In a way they have to operate that way to get work done, at least as far as software development is concerned, but that type of process does not work well with a stakeholder organization that is trying to address the needs of diverse groups.

All I pointed out was that decentralization is not a bright line so your analysis is not correct. In order to analyze these issues you have study the risks. Look at the Jim Harper Bitcoin risk analysis he did for the Foundation. You need to use that format like that to expand on the analysis of just how much of an issue it is. I have brought this up to the developers and some seem to want to analyze things that way but resources are limited.
@_date: 2015-11-10 21:31:20
That is possible and true in the minority of cases but you cannot depend on that.  That is like depending on miners to mine at loss and it isn't going to happen over the long term.

Jerry Brito is one of the best people in the Bitcoin space to promote a sensible approach to the masses.  He deals in facts rather than linking Bitcoin to some agenda that most people will never endorse.  Too bad the Bitcoin Foundation is standing behind some of the unreasonable/ignorant people involved with Bitcoin and attacks Coin Center instead of promoting it. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:21:30


And why did he do this?  Because he likes regulation and regulators ... or because there were things proposed anyway and he wanted a blueprint for reasonable rules instead of another Bitlicense debacle.  I am sure this was explained but you choose to misrepresent things so it fits your wing nut agenda.  
I don't see what the privacy policies of major companies has anything to do with it.  Those companies rarely, if ever, follow the actual written policies.  The announcements of CEO's when posturing rarely have anything to do with actual practices and procedures.  This is just red herring you are throwing about government wanting the private encryption keys (I assume).  What does this have to do with Coin center's activities?  What kind of false choice are you trying to make?
As for the EFF, they have posted their reasons for not liking the CA bill.  These are the same things Coin Center complains about all the time so they are essentially on the same page.  You can sit there and cry about it, post a bunch of complaints on Reddit, file a frivolous lawsuit to sue for $1 billion, or take any one of a number of actions that will do absolutely nothing .... or you can actually try to fix the situation with a reasonable attempt.
I am not discounting your experience, I am pointing out that you have essentially little to no experience in these areas.  The developers are generally 20-something techies who have less experience than you.  While most people in the industry agree that these bitlicense things are being done poorly not everyone takes the wing nut position that is put forth by the Foundation.  You are not on the same page as many of venture capitalists who are pumping in money or some of the exchanges.  You are all against burdensome regulation but you diverge wildly from there when the solution is discussed.  What I hear the venture capitalists complain about is there concern over the weird notions of some of the trying to start Bitcoin companies and they are concerned these people will lose their investments due to irresponsibility.
Anyone who doesn't agree with the extreme positions that you put forth is  "on the other side" or "promoting regulation" or a "statist" and so forth.  That is very far from the truth and that is what wing nuts do.  There is no middle ground or reasonable discussion, it is all "they are the violent ones" and "leviathan" bs.

You are supposed to be running a Foundation and you go around calling people "trolls?"  How old are you?
An organization that is promoting Bitcoin would stay neutral on those issues and they certainly would not be putting out the childish tweets.  On top of that you should have your tweeter check with your chief scientist before tweeting incorrect technical information.
If the Foundation were actually promoting Bitcoin they would be promoting merchant adoption, Unicode symbols, educational videos (without the political agendas), etc.  If you want to promote some nut case agenda go right ahead but don't go around claiming you are promoting all of Bitcoin or try to imply everybody who uses Bitcoin agrees.  When I discuss Bitcoin with random people not involved in the whole Reddit/Foundation/Bitcointalk world almost nobody agrees with your agenda and they never will.  You are so involved with your little group that you don't take that into account or even see it.  
The Foundation is not Bitcoin, it is one faction of Bitcoin.  That one guy from MIT wants to use Bitcoin to promote some kind of socialist agenda and I want nothing to do with that either.
it all boils down to the fact that I am involved in Bitcoin but I want no association with the agenda of Roger, Erik, etc.  You guys are embarrassing and if you want some little club to promote your ideas go ahead but don't use the technology to try to drag people into it because that will never work and you just damage Bitcoin.

This all depends on Bitcoin being the only currency and there is no basis for that.  There are fiat currencies and many crypto currencies, etc.  people have had the ability to demand "sane" policies long before Bitcoin so why would Bitcoin suddenly change human nature?  Bitcoin is a voluntary system so the only way to do what you are suggesting is to force people to use Bitcoin and nothing else.  There is also no explanation how Bitcoin would make government more accountable.
As for roads and hospitals, etc. you don't explain who would build them or what their incentive would be.  Thinks like war are funded in the same way and many other things not war related  and there is never any explanation of how Bitcoin will change that.
In any case your whole theory depends on people realizing something that has been known for many years and I don't see how Bitcoin changes human nature.  If people could be convinced by the arguments you are presenting they would have moved into things like gold years ago.  
I don't see where Bitcoin has anything to do with war or whether governments can fund things.

No, what you are doing is throwing a temper tantrum because you are looking at the personalities involved rather than the issues of risk.  While it is true there are some checks and balances there are several chokepoints that are a risk to the Bitcoin system.  Just because it is a risk does not mean it will definatly be a problem but it has the potential to be a problem.  No matter who the people are, there is a risk in having just 5 people being in control of the Github.  many of them have business interests in how Bitcoin gets developed causing all these arguments over side chains, block size, etc.  Waiving you hand, pretending it is not an issue, and saying anyone can contribute is not a solution as it evident by the constant lobbying of the core developers to add things.  Treating the situation like a cultist is not doing Bitcoin any good.
The Bitcoin Foundation pays most of the developers and they exert control over Bitcoin.org by paying the people to operate that.  The Wiki is also controlled by essentially the same group and while it has some good information much of it is inaccurate and incomplete and it is not a dependable resource.

Bitcoin is only a partial solution to the byzantine General problem.  In that problem you have a fact that gets conveyed to the recipients.  In Bitcoin miners set the "facts" and someone with 51% of the hashing power can change those facts.  You have to trust that the mining system in order to trust the data.  Requiring people to trust that process is like trying to pass a law that says 2+2=5.

It is not "just you saying," you used the Foundation to put forth your political agenda.  You constantly go out of your way to use your position with the Foundation promote Roger Ver when he tries to tie in his personal political agendas into Bitcoin discussions.  Wars and children dying have nothing to do with Bitcoin and the Foundation should not involved in those issues.  I assume in your world you either support Ver or you support killing children?
I believe engaging people like Coin Center does is a great idea and does much  to promote Bitcoin.  I believe your position damages Bitcoin.  I believe claiming every interaction is helping "the violent ones" is ignorant.  Even though many things are done wrong you depend on people like ICE and DHS for many things.  You would not have the life you have now if those things did not exist and you offer no reasonable alternative.  I don't care what you people think but I don't like linking your agenda to my money.  you use US dollars so you must support the policies of the USA, including ICE and DHS ... Right?  lol

You are doing work to prove you did work.  The work itself is "useless" except to prove you did work to get the answer.  If someone wanted to create "fake" block they could just insert into the blockchain if no work was required.  However, under "proof of work" they would have to buy many computers and expend a large amount of resources to get that fake block in there and it is not worth it to do that.  As a user you have a reasonable expectation that everything is correct because a bad actor would have to have huge amounts of computer power to insert a "fake" block.

Yes, but roger Ver's agenda has little or nothing to do with the Bitcoin technology.

As a result you are damaging Bitcoin by coming out against initiative started by reasonable people at Coin Center.  The Foundation has some teenager tweeting out stuff related to your personal political agenda rather than promoting the Bitcoin technology.  If you want to be involved in Ver's personal political agenda then start a Foundation for that and don't try to hijack Bitcoin for your purposes.

There is no such demarcation.  People want services and VC's want to provide those services so they can make a profit.

Bitcoin is a solution to a computer science problem and can be used by all sorts of people with all sorts of ideologies.

Some people have latched onto Bitcoin as a way of promoting their ideology because their ideology does not stand on its own merit.  They try to imply people who use Bitcoin agree with them and they try to claim it was developed for their purposes.  They often try to say Satoshi agrees with them by putting words in his mouth or making unrealistic claims about what he said or did.

All it means is that people can see the code.  you can suggest changes but the final decisions on accepting it is a very small number of people.  You can create your own version but you would have to convince all users to run the software so that is generally not realistic.
Some people claim that being open source means it is decentralized but that is incorrect.  the software development for Bitcoin is very centralized.  In Bitcoin the only part that is decentralized is the consensus over the state of the blockchain and that is done by a very expensive and slow process of mining.
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:08:25
Here is another [legal issue from the same company] (
The trademark office asked them if the term "BITCOIN" had any significance and they said no.  If they had told the truth that the term referred to the cyryptocurrency then their application would probably have been rejected.  Instead they proceeded as if they came up with new "brand" called "Bitcoin" for barware.   
I think I could bring a separate complaint against the attorney.  in any case the trademark board cannot force damages, they simply register things and make decisions on whether something can be registered.

PorcFest is already a cult gathering.  I never realized the people involved with things like that are so ignorant.  I really got to see that when I got involved with Bitcoin.  While I see the erosion of liberty as a problem the collection of uneducated idiots who attend those events will do nothing to improve the situation.
I really like the people who complain about my handle as the Bitcoin creator also used a handle.  That is typical of the Free State/porcfest/cultist people as it points out how their arguments are so poorly constructed.  But it is funny how they win every single argument in their mind.

Your little story is why your branding style is not good.  Your logic is allow wrong and full of wrong assumptions.  First you want to create this "us vs. them" mentality and act like you know everything when you actually know very little.  They you call everyone "sheeple" and explain how everyone has been running the world all wrong but, based on some reddit postings and some web site, you have all the answers.  However, this all depends on the people you just called "sheeple" to go along with what you say.  Oh, and part of your claim is that this great hammer will work great in situations where a screw driver is needed when it obviously does not.  But that would go against your agenda so you won't mention it.  
Now if your point of this whole discussion is to deflate on of the cultist claims that Bitcoin has intrinsic value because the software is useful then I agree.  Like you say Bitcoin went through a time where it was worth nothing and you can compare the value of hobo nickels to Bitcoin.  They use the same technology but have vastly different valuations for a number of reasons.  You don't need a long talk to make that point.
As for the rest of the discussion about branding, you have no idea what you are talking about.  People will use Apple pay, paypal, etc. because it is easier so branding is very, very important.  
Your real message is similar to Rassah.  You think that people will use Bitcoin and then be "enlightened" and go along with your entire "anarchist" agenda.  The reality is people see some geek spouting off about anarchy.  They just roll their eyes and move on.

When you compare Bitcoin to bank people generally say that Bitcoin is decentralized and the bank is not.  However, it is more complicated then that.

It was February 10, 2015.  like I said it is treated like a secret society and they give different stories to different people so maybe you were told differently.  Who knows?  Transparency with the Foundation has always been an issue.  Whether you agree, disagree, there are different stories, Theymos did this, Gavin said that etc.  Then people sit around saying people don't understand or have the story wrong.  Is it is a risk of the Bitcoin system that users don't know the real story of who has control over the resources.  As for Github, there is no way to tell what goes on behind the scenes or what messages get deleted.

I think the people who control the github will win.  They think that Bitcoin needs the larger block size to scale.  
There is a group of people who want to try to force increases in the transaction fees by keeping the blocks the same.  If space in the blocks were to be become "scarce" then miners could demand larger fees to give transactions priority.  Of course this could push users to use some other method (not Bitcoin) that has lower fees.  The long term economic viability of mining is a definite risk to Bitcoin and some believe that limited block size will help reduce this risk.

Your reply says nothing about actual real-world problems and really says nothing.   The same argument can be made about government.  Plus, many people in Bitcoin steal money at the drop of a hat.

You look on the USPTO web site and you find when a trademark is published for opposition.  then you file a notice of opposition stating the reasons (and pay $300).  Then you go into litigation with witnesses, evidence, and so forth.  this guy decided it wasn't worth arguing with me so he just defaulted and didn't answer at all.

@_date: 2015-03-16 16:51:40
This is from the US trademark office:
Registration was refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature of applicant’s services. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq. As previously stated, a mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose or use of the specified goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005); In re Gyulay, 820 F.2d 1216, 1217-18, 3 USPQ2d 1009, 1010 (Fed. Cir. 1987). 
As seen from the previously attached evidence as well as the attached evidence, the term BLOCKCHAIN refers to a transaction database openly shared among peers regarding cryptocurrency.  The term BLOCKCHAIN identifies the public record of the transactions of the decentralized electronic currency called Bitcoins in chronological order.  When customers would view the term BLOCKCHAIN in relation to the stated “Financial services, namely, providing a virtual currency for use by members of an on-line community via a global computer network”, they would immediately know it was referring to the openly shared transaction database used to keep track of the virtually currency.  The term BLOCKCHAIN is not a source identifier for a particular entity; rather as evidenced from the attached, the term BLOCKCHAIN, along with terms such as BITCOINS, MINING, WALLET, etc. are in the public realm to be used by all who participate in cryptocurrency.  It is not a term that can be trademarked by one entity. 
The applicant confirms “BLOCKCHAIN” ‘is now a part of cryptocurrency nomenclature’. However applicant  states ‘[w]hile the word has meaning – it is not a descriptive word.’  The examining attorney must respectfully disagree.  The term BLOCKCHAIN when used in relation to the stated financial services would be perceived by the members of the on-line community as merely identifying the public record of financial transactions.  The term would not be viewed as an identifier of source.  Thus the refusal to register the mark pursuant to Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act is repeated and made final.
@_date: 2015-03-24 11:28:49
Yes, there is quite a bit of misinformation about this.  this is because some people claim Bitcoin is "anonymous" and then some Bitcoiners respond by saying that every transaction can be traced.  The truth is somewhere in between.  Technically it is true that every transaction can be traced but the real-world situation is that it depends on the specific facts of the situation as to how traceable any specific transaction actually is.  Someone with knowledge of Bitcoin can make transactions effectively anonymous if they put enough effort into it.

Just because he is starting a group does not mean he is supporting any type of regulation or any specify agency, policy, or whatever.  I had a day job for 27 years with the federal government (9 years in DC) and in my spare time I got involved in all kinds of policy groups involving privacy.  I testified at a few workshops at the FTC and I have met many members of groups like the EFF.  I can safely say that after watching Jerry Brito he is the most knowledgeable person by orders of magnitudes as compared to you, Ver, Erik, etc.  you are newbies to this and is in immediatly obvious to any experienced person.  Erik's screw up with those Windover Pinicples is a good example.   
I never said everyone agreed with me outside of reddit/Foundation, etc.  I said they would never agree with you and your agenda.  You guys think (Rassah at least admits it) that once people understand Bitcoin they will agree with your entire agenda.  I am saying there is zero chance of that.  
I actually agree with many of the basic points that liberty has eroded and I even work with the libertarian party in NJ Open Government project to sue various government entities over open records.  However, the agenda pushers who have latched onto Bitcoin and claim Bitcoin will end wars, that governments are 'the violent ones," and all that other nonsense is way too far out for me and I want no association with any of that.
Jerry Brito is clearly the expert in these matters which can be seen from watching his videos and presentations. I don't believe every major miner, CEO, venture backed company, developer, influencer, early adopter and techie in the industry agrees with you.  Your implication that they do is why I can't stand you and your agenda pushers.

You really don't what Satoshi knew or didn't know.

Yes, I saw the cringeworthy by Coinbase but I am sure his investors keep him in check.  You don't see any successful bitcoin company going around claiming the intent of their services is to end war or replace the US dollar (like people such as Ver, Vorhees, and Rassah claim).
Coin Center does what they want and it is unclear why you want the government to regulate their activities via some legally binding whatever (who knows what you are talking about here).
Privacy right/human rights are things bestowed by other people and governments.  There is no single "Bitcoin industry" with a single agenda and nobody in Bitcoin has any authority to tell another authority what can or cannot be done.  privacy rights in the USA are very limited and privacy is something you generally have to do for yourself.  What some corporate person said as part of their lobbying isn't really important and it is unclear what point you are trying to make.
The point is Bruce has no idea what he is talking about and I referenced the people he hangs with rather than his direct statements.  But, OK, lets address his statement here:


Right there he shows he has essentially no idea how the process works.  Those agencies have tremendous influence in shaping policy and they routinely engage in such.  Simply look at the records of hearings and legislative history of related legislation.  
To summarize, Jerry Brito is an expert in this area and Bruce Fenton is not.

That is the FBAR to FinCEN which is not filed with the  IRS or included in your tax return.  the limit is $10K and that is the total account value and not interest or gain.  FinCEN and IRS are different agencies with different missions.  Many people get confused over these things because they think the government is a single entity working in concert and they are not.  These different laws are passed at different times and promulgated by different committees with different missions.  There is nobody in charge of correlating all these things.  In this case it results in overlapping fillings with different agencies over the same issue which is why I use a lawyer instead of Reddit.

I believe there are settings in your account so you can vary what you accept.
I found it:
The speed setting changes the length of time we wait before notifying you of a payment. The medium setting is recommended for most merchants as it is considered safe and on average payments are confirmed in 10 minutes.
If immediate notification of payments is desired, the high speed setting will enable this. However this setting makes you susceptible to receiving fraudulent payments and is not recommended.
Regardless of the risk setting, a fully paid invoice is credited to your account only after the transaction has accrued six confirmations. On average this takes an hour. If at any point we detect a payment to be invalid you will receive an email and a web hook POST immediately.

I read the Coin center blog and look at his videos and I follow what he does.  
As for Lawsky I have always complained about him.  I said from the beginning that the whole thing was his attempt at publicity.  I essentially agreed with Jim Harper's analysis.  NY should have first done a gap analysis looking at current regulations in place before doing anything.  Instead Lawsky went ahead with anew rulemaking so he could appear in the news.  He then leveraged that into a private practice.  That Ted Chino guy who ran for the Foundation board seat is suing the state of NY claiming the Bitlicense cost his small business $1 billion dollars.
The EFF does not go out and attack Coin Center.  Coin Center has essentially the same position as EFF on these issues so if you support one then you probably support the other.  EFF does little or nothing except write a few blog posts an appear at conference now and then.   Coin Center is taking an active approach to try to do something.  The wing nut position of the Foundation is to attack Coin Center and praise Roger Ver.  I was happy ignoring the Foundation until you started using it to attack Coin Center.  Now I am back to wanting it gone.
as for your other tweets, Bitcoin is only a partial solution to the Byzantine general problem.  The problem involves a "fact" is to be transmitted to various entities.  In Bitcoin the miners create the "facts" so a user has to trust the mining system is working as intended before transactions can be considered "trustless."  A 51% attack would not be possible if proof of work was a full solution to the problem.  
As for the issues I am discussing this is a common argument within places like the Free State project.  You have people who want to take a reasonable approach while you have a competing group of wing nuts who make everyone involved with the project look ridiculous.  
As far as the Foundation's agenda, I agree with people like Preston Byrne, Casey Kuhlman, Tim Swanson, and Jerry Brito:
@_date: 2015-10-26 15:24:28
He promoted Mt. Gox when it was obvious people would lose their funds, he set up that Bitcoin Bounty web site/video which speaks for itself, he pressured Ripple to sell him coins illegally and they got caught and fined $750K, he gave up his citizenship and then complains that a clerk at a passport window did not adjudicate his complex legal issues, he supported Shrem when it was obvious he was no capable of running a finical services business, and he claims Bitcoin will end wars.  He also used Ross Ulbrichts Mother to try to support his political agenda while she was going through a very difficult time.  Rather than focus of a criminal defense he was worried about making vieos to promote his agenda.  Ver has also sued several other Bitcoiners such as Amir Taaaki for breqch of contract.  The lawsuit says Ver does not actually have a copy of the contract but if you get hold of Amir, he has a copy.  As for the fireworks he claims he went to jail because he accused the federal agents of being the criminals at Waco, TX so they gave him a larger sentence.  He also keeps associate himself with Satoshi when Satoshi has nothing to do with him.  He also recently posted a tweet of his new hard drive and claimed the block size debate was about having enough disk space for the blockchain (which, of course it is much more complicated than that). 
These are just some of the ridiculous things he has done.  Bitcoin is not going to have mass adoption if it is associated with people like Ver.

One of the problems here is that people are not doing a rigorous risk analysis when changes are made.  Instead of identifying the pertinent risks and comparing how these risks change based on analysis and testing you have a bunch of people tweeting and starting reddit posts.  Then when people complain sometimes a developer will post things to try to calm people down.  This is not a substitute for a real analysis and at some point problem will arise similar to March 2013.  Something could happen anyway since resources to do such an analysis are limited but there would be a much lower risk.  Users should be wary of  developers who try to promote a point of view by political means such  tweets, looking for Reddit upvotes, etc.   They should be able to point to a risk analysis that compares the current system to proposed changes.  It is done now to a certain extent depending on the BIP and the people involved but there is no standard way of doing things.  Many people approach things from different perspectives.

the developers need to start using the systems engineering methods that were started by Jim Harper. That risk analysis is supposed to be a living document and is supposed to be part of the decision-making process. Gavin doing tests on his Mac Book is a good start but it is not a systematic way of addressing the risks of changes to the code. The endless arguments over block size and similar issues should be evaluated as part of the overall risks and compared to alternatives.

Yes, but the developers have also put "checkpoints" in the software.  this is done to prevent someone from wasting your computer resources by sending you a wild goose chase of downloading a fake chain (early fake blocks can be easily created due to the low difficulty of early blocks).  However, this effectively allows the developers to choose the "correct" chain at least up to the checkpoint.

Bitcoin is not a direct competition for credit cards, they are different things to use under different circumstances.  the credit card fees have to do with the dispute process which does not exist in Bitcoin natively.  the first issue is whether the buyers needs the dispute mechanism available via credit cards.

Bitcoin was created to try to (partially) solve a computer science problem called the Byzantine General's Problem.

He calculates the private key because the random number generator was bad and he calculates the private key from signatures (so you need a at least 2 transactions).  In a way you can call that "hacked" but he has never calculated a private key from a public key by breaking the crypto.  That would mean solving a "discrete logarithm" problem.
as a side note some also gets wallets that are encrypted and he cracks the encryption password to get the contents of the wallet (which has the private keys).  In those cases he is not calculating a private key from a public key or Bitcoin address.  He needs the wallet file to do this.

The people who work on Bitcoin.org say they are paid by the Foundation and Gavin runs the Github where the site is developed.  As for the core developers they are paid by the Foundation.  Some have joined a company that is promoted by the Foundation and you have one guy paid by Bitpay.  Then you have other that contribute as volunteers but they are controlled by the owner of the Github which I believe is Gavin.  You are correct that I don't have links because it is treated like a secret society and nobody wants to post a clear explanation and things have to be pieced together. 
In any case what you are doing is very common problem in risk analysis.  People throw up a fence and claim a territory and insert personalities into the discussion of risk analysis.  The small number of Core Developers, the influence of the Foundation, and the "secret society" aspect of the whole thing are definite risks.  How much of a risk I really don't know but it is s definite problem that a small number of developers have significant control.  Many of the developers don't really have experience in other things outside of code development.
Jim harper tried to introduce a risk analysis but it was dropped and never really used correctly.   It was somewhat biased because it did not address the risks of the Foundation itself but at least it was a start. 
In the current "secret society" it is not allowed to bring up certain risks related to the Foundation, Github, etc. or people get "scolded" and "shunned."  This is a common practice and it causes accidents and security breaches.  People are not allowed to address risks in fear of insulting someone, making a supervisor look bad, making a contractor look bad, etc.  This is how the Space Shuttle blew up.

Bittburger is 100% correct.  Just because a developer does good work does not make that person an expert in other areas.  The current system where a small number of developers have control over major Bitcoin resources is very problematic such as the Wiki and Bitcoin.org.  The solution is that other entities develop their own resources so the resources controlled by the developers/Foundation are less important (I know people will say the Foundation is separate from what the developers do but for all practical purposes the major developers are Foundation employees and the Foundation effectively controls the resources).

I used to think that free state project was a good thing until I got to see it up close when I got involved in Bitcoin.  The first experience was the coverage of the first bit Bitcoin.  they ran commercials claiming all government employees were murders.  Yes, that means janitors, social security workers, astronauts, etc. ... all "murderers."   Then I saw they started to claim that using Bitcoin would somehow end wars.  They would not explain it directly but they have some crazy theory that somehow governments will be forced to use Bitcoin and somehow this will cause to lose control over the finances and they won't be able to fund wars.  It is totally ridiculous which is why they never try to explain it.
Since then I have watched some of the people who have come out of the program and I have come to the conclusion that they are primarily mentally ill people.  They argue endlessly pointing to some obscure reference and they claim they win every argument and everyone else is stupid.  They constantly misrepresent Bitcoin and they claim it has this huge economy that has been increasing 'exponentially' since 2010.  they also claim the 21 million Bitcoin limit is "impossible" to change yet they say it is easy to fix bugs.  They misrepresent things all the time because they have associated the success of their agenda with the success of Bitcoin.  Grouping everyone together in one area turns out bad because they live in an echo chamber and they reinforce each other with total nonsense and they come out of the program all arrogant.

"Fork" had different definitions depending on the context.  A "hard fork" in the github software is any change in the consensus software.  
However, a "hard fork" as far as Bitcoin network goes means the software is not compatible with older versions so you MUST upgrade for your wallet to work.  a "soft fork" means just the miners need to upgrade.  Most updates are neither, they just update some features but it is still backward compatible.
There are some people working to update the Bitcoin software so they can separate the consensus rules from the rest of the software.  Right now you have to analyze each change to determine if it will result in a hard fork, soft fork, or just an update that won't create a Bitcoin network fork.

Yes it is possible, if someone has been mining in secret.  for Bitcoin that is a very low risk but only because of the hash rate (which is not guaranteed in the future).  This can be done rather easily with many alt-coins with low hash rates.  The only reason to separate Bitcoin from any other alt-coin in a law would be the hash rate (or network effect) and it is problematic to create laws that force a user to accept the risk of a specific hash rate.

I got used to Bitcoin armory early on.  Use the cold wallet feature on an old computer that never goes online.  Then backup the key for the wallet on paper and remotely electronically (in case you can't get to your house).  The key is just a string of letters so even if someone found it they cannot tell what it is if it is not marked as Bitcoin backups.  As long as you have an old computer there is no cost.

Yes, you ignorant cultists are.  Bitcoin is not a religion, it is a technology.  It is a new technology, and it is unproven and the model has many flaws.  Anyone who discusses the flaws or issues is either an idiot, Bitcoin hater, or paid shill according to you conspiracy theorists and cultists.  You make Bitcoiners sound like a bunch of idiots.  The article is perfectly fine and discusses relevant issues.

In the long term I am not sure what it means.  there is also a copyright notice on the Core Client.  The control is exerted by hiring developers and control over the most popular repository.

I wish people would stop trying to link their political agenda to Bitcoin.  That is going nowhere and it is hurting mass adoption.  I use Bitcoin but I don't want to be associated with some guy claims Bitcoin will end war and who claims federal agents are "the violent ones."  And I am tired of hearing him complain that some clerk at a passport windows did not handle his legal issues.  Normal people are not like him and it does not help things to associate him as the "face" of Bitcoin.

There is no single "government."  there are various entities that have different missions and are covered by different laws.  The money transmitter laws cover transmission of things with stored value.  The IRS is also just guidance they give to follow their rules.  they have a phone number on there and you can ask your questions to an IRS attorney directly.  I have called her before and she is helpful.

It is a little annoying to have to get the blockchain updated locally and I have to move the data directories to a spare disk so it wouldn't fill up the C: drive.  But this is the tradeoff for having a decentralized system and I probably would not use Armory if I had to depend on them to supply the Blockchain data.
Many people say "decentralize everything" but the world would come to a halt if that were to happen.  Decentralization is expensive and time consuming and is only for things that really need it.

The lack of an incentive to run a full node is a flaw in the Bitcoin incentive system.  A solution is needed that avoids the "Sybil attack" where some entities run many nodes that don't really contribute to the network security.  You have to somehow measure the impact on the improvement to network security and incentivize a node that way.

This class is one of the most important things in moving Bitcoin forward at the moment.  The misinformation being spread by the people who are using Bitcoin to promote an agenda is unbelievable.  You may note that the agenda pushers (that some people on here worship)are nowhere to be found when a legitimate place like Princeton U. gets involved.  The agenda-pushers don't want educational because their main goal is to promote the nonsense associated with their fantasy agendas and not facts.
Couple that with the many people who are against Bitcoin because they misunderstand it and you have the mess that you see now in many of the threads posted here, on Bitcointalk and in the media.
If you really want to understand Bitcoin take this class and listen to people like Jerry Brito at Coin Center.

Theymos owns the site, there is nothing that can be down while that is that way.  I tried to get them to update the Wiki and put the relevant info into Bitcoin.org but they would have none of it.  the solution is to ignore the Wiki and develop your own resources as it is pointless to argue with crazy people like Luke and Theymos.
This is indirectly the fault of the Bitcoin Foundation.  They elevate Theymos' status in the Bitcoin world by doing things like giving him the emergency alert key.  Now he has control over several resources and the only thing to do is make these resources less important.  as long as software developers are given authority to do things outside of software development you can expect these things to happen.

Yes, they don't identify themselves on their web site.  their domain registration info is "Xiamen eName Network Co., Ltd." but you should not have to go the whois lookup for that.  they don't meet basic standards of a financial web site.  for instance, they could not operate under the proposed Bitlicense and they could not even run banner ads using Google because they both require the company to be identified on the web site where they do business.

I said there are no commercial goods that currently use Bitcoin.  In fact most people promoting smart contracts cannot even describe a realistic business case.  Not that they don't exist or that smart contracts can eventually be used but most of the people discussing now have no clue how it would be used in the real world.
As for "trolling," that is a term used by teenagers for people they don't agree with.  It is mostly custist who go around calling people "trolls" in Bitcoin discusssions.  If someone makes a comment that does not agree with the circle-jerkers that does not make them "trolls."  Posts about trolls rank right up with posts like "He gets it" and "Gentlemen."

No, while these developers add some technical knowledge allowing these guys to "run" Bitcoin is a huge disaster.  It is true in any software development and it is certainly not limited to Luke-Jr.  None of the core developers really have any experience in these things outside of developing code.  Allowing them to set policy is a disaster.  Luke-Jr is just worse than the others so he gets noticed more.
Luke-Jr does not understand how to bring Bitcoin to the masses.  The worst part about this situation is that Luke-Jr constantly defaces the Wiki and exerts centralized control over it.  The guy was an underemployed gamer before Bitcoin and he knows little or nothing about the world outside of the code development.

I don't know what it would do and neither do the people making the claims.  It certainly does attract all kinds of criminal activity, fraud, counterfeit drugs, sending unsecured drugs through the mail, and sorts of other problems not discussed.  Whether such a system is beneficial as compared to other systems is an open question.
The problem is the exaggeration of what things can do.  Bitcoin is a great invention and very useful in certain situations but it isn't going to end wars, replace the US dollar, or reshape society.  That does not mean it is a failure or no good just because it cannot do those things.

Bitcoin is fine.  It is designed to do decentralized transactions, not instantaneous transactions.  You are trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.  You are not a "Bitcoin hater" just because you are pointing out that Bitcoin cannot do something it was not designed to do.  The problem is with people creating unrealistic expectations.
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:55:22
I understand the implications fully.  There are a bunch of nut jobs who overstate things to a ridiculous extent.  They often state that everybody else "doesn't understand" when they are usually young people who have accomplished next to nothing yet they tell the rest of the world they are doing everything wrong.  Their arguments usually amount so some simplistic idea or meme that does not take into account the complexities of the real world.
Bitcoin is a tool that can be used by many different people for many different reasons.  The agenda-pushers will try to make you believe that if you use Bitcoin then you automatically agree with their agenda.  That is not close to being true and most users with never agree.  
I am upset over the people who misrepresent Bitcoin to promote an agenda.  a quick look back at kwanijml recent comments and you will see:  "When are you state-educated morons..."  Well I was educated by the Sate of NJ and I have a Master's degree in physics as well as a degree in Computer science.  Professor Felton has substantially more than that.  What degrees do you have other then posting to reddit how everybody does not understand?
Bitcoin certainly does have political implications but those implications do not include ending wars, collapsing governments, or replacing all government fiat.  The fact is these people don't want to take the class and they don't want other to because it blow their nonsense right out of the water and they won't be able to act like a big shot on reddit anymore.

I will make it more clear.  Both Free Talk Live and the Free State Project are a bunch of lunatics.  For example:  Roger Ver, Erik Vorhees, Stepahnie Murphy, Amanda BillyRock, Trace Mayer, Nakamoto "Institute" are examples.  They misrepresent Bitcoin because they are using Bitcoin as a way of promoting their agenda.  other than that I could care less about what they say or do.  
You, like them, put words in Satoshi's mouth and try to misrepresent things.  that is because nobody listens to your nonsense so you have try to say Satoshi agreed with what you are saying.  Most of the resonating is made up as Satoshi never did most of those things.  he created a software that is a partial solution to the Byzantine General's problem.  Satoshi never discussed government spending, that is lunatic crap.  the constant misrepresentations like you are doing is why I cannot stand both the Free state project and Free Talk Live.  It is a bunch of wing nuts and mental cases.

It is called "change."  All transactions require the totals of the transaction to be zero.  This means if you have 10 BTC and send 2 BTC to someone then another hidden transaction is created in your wallet sending 8 BTC to a new address.
If you backup before the transaction your "change" address may not be backed up.

FinCEN is essentially the prosecutor.  They don't create the laws but they put out their interpretation.  They are essentially putting out guidelines and saying if you follow this you (probably) won't get prosecuted.  If there eventually is a prosecution it is the court that would make the final decision whether the law was broken.  Most people don't want to get involved with the expense of prosecution so they follow the guidance.  If you really disagree with their guidance you can ask for a declaratory ruling from the court before any prosecution issues arises.

Right, that is the purpose of deterministic wallets.  The standard Bitcoin wallet does not do this so all the keys must be backup on.  The problem comes in with "change" addresses.

Alt-coins successful?  Maybe, maybe not.  You need to get enough miners to ensure the security and you need a critical mass of users/merchants (what Andreas calls the "network effect").  If something has great features but cannot achieve this it won't succeed.
The problem with namecoin, beyond the network effect and forking issues, is that .bit domains are not in the ICANN root.  This means you have to get users/ISP's to change their DNS configuration.  This has been tried many times before (new.net is one that make a big attempt) and it has never worked out.

From the original paper:
7. Reclaiming Disk Space
Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before
it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,
transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do
not need to be stored.
A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are
generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in

I am coming with a backup scheme for new users who want to secure larger funds.  I think the best way to go is use a deterministic wallet and back it up with keePass.  KeePass can be securely backed up remotely and it has optional 2-factor login that includes both a password and a file to access the database.  You need remote backups and your next of kin needs to able to access the funds if you are incapacitated.

That problem is more 'difficult' but "difficulty" in Bitcoin has  special meaning.  It is essentially the "difficulty" in fining a single block.  The "difficulty" in finding a single block in a  fork is the same (until the network readjusts).  It is more "difficult" to find several blocks in a row and orphan blocks but the term "difficulty" is not applied to that situation.

They have a practice statement.  Theoretically, users are supposed to read these statements and decide if the practices are sufficient to trust them.  The reality is that anyone who cuts a deal with the browser developers gets their authority on the approved list and nobody reads the statements.
bitcointalk.org has an SSL cert even though their whois records are under privacy.  That does not verify anything except the address is the whois record at the time the certificate was issued clicked the confirmation link.

The offline version has the private keys so you need the offline version to print the backup.
For transactions you make unsigned transactions with the online version, then you sign with offline version because it has the private keys, then you broadcast with the online version.

Black Friday started in Philadelphia in the 1950's.  Initially it is was coined by police to describe all the traffic downtown on that day.  An offhand comment by the Strawbridge Department store owner said Black Friday is the day our finances go from Red to Black for the year (in other words, they covered their expenses and the rest of the sales are profits).  The terms started being used in other areas of the US in the 1980's.

I bought an old laptop and loaded Lubuntu.  You load Armory there and create an offline wallet.  Make a watch-only copy and use that on your online computer.  
You can receive as normal.  When you send you need a USB stick.  You create the transaction online and save to a USB stick.  Put it in the laptop and sign the transaction.  Move the stick back to your online computer to broadcast.  
One you set it up and do it a couple times it is easy.

I complained to Mike Hearn about this and I pointed out that he should worry about things like this before worrying about the Crypt Locker thing.  The exchanges need banks accounts and this is not helping.  He was not very receptive to that idea of doing something about the scams on the forum.

Your wallet totals up all the address balances for you.  If you use Armory all you have to backup is the one set of keys.  It is actually easier to keep track of payments because they all go a different address and you can add a note from within armory.  It could cost a little more in transaction fees in some cases but that is usually negligible.  When you send payments you can use the "coin control" button to control which addresses the payments get sent from.

Support tickets take 9 days to answer.  It is clear they are swamped so you normally get some kind of vague, incomplete answer and the process starts all over again.  If you run into a complex issue it is next to impossible to work through it.  This is a financial institution who is handling large sums of money and the staff takes these issue too lightly.

I am not a legal expert but I believe there is less regulation in that case.  You are selling computer power to someone for a fee.  They are mining and paying you the fee.  I think they are talking about things like Alydian where they mined for other parties under a contract.

I think the way to go is a 2-facor key so you need both parts.  One part goes to your family and one part to a lawyer/accountant who can release their half after you are gone.  Of course you would have both halves so you can access the funds at any time.  The family and the lawyer cannot access the funds without both parts of the key.

open up armory and double click the name of wallet (under "Available Wallets").  on the right side it will say to export individual keys.  A wallet generally has more than one key.

Go see a tax advisor and discuss "self-directed" IRA where you leave the Bitcoins in your retirement account and pay no tax on the gains until you withdrawal.  Of course if you are depending on the money to live in retirement you are nuts to put it into something risky like Bitcoin when it is at record highs.

I believe he is holding on to the funds in case he gets prosecuted for all the illegal stuff that goes on with the message board he operates.
It was also explained to him that you don't post your security configurations on the public Internet yet he does his troubleshooting on reddit.  Any attacker can follow what is going or even inject "solutions" that could lead to more hacks.  Even if a vulnerability is discovered you are now leaving many other sites open to a zero-day exploit.  
Theymos absolutely insists on being unprofessional in every way and it makes Bitcoin look ridiculous time and time again.
