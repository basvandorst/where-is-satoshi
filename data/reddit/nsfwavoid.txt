@_date: 2018-09-18 13:38:44
Why would someone only use BTC? Lol remember the legendary pizza story? XDD In my money making eyes, I see no point in spending crypto, I see it as more of a way to protect your money from the evil thieves of banks and the government.
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:22:57
But you guys are the reason that we keep pushing the new ATH. Look at the bright side of things..... If we didnt have you people that buy at ATH, we could never have the next ATH.

@_date: 2019-06-27 21:54:59
Haha just yesterday I looked at how much I bought when I got it when I was 16, not 15.... 
anyways i had just about 1/6 of a coin. 87$/600 
Omg that is 1.4k today lol I don’t remember why I wanted to get btc then but I spent it how did I get $100? Allowance savings for 1 year.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:52:12
I wish I had a job to invest haha only 18 -.- I bought some bitcoin when I was 15 hehe I have way but I wish I knew about btc when I was 12 lol
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:22:14
I'm sorry, it's not like a credit card, you can't charge back. And DAMNNNN what a generic scam, taking advantage of old people, smh....
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:06:25
Haha just check my wallet I used back then. 
13% of a BTC guess I thought it was much earlier.
That was in September of 2016, 1 BTC was $600. Today that would be 1.4k....
I guess I remember looking at BTC when it was $200 and associated the two being related.
Damn it hurts to know your past mistakes....
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:32:04
Damn! These are the real gains
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:11:10
Lol it just DROPPED. What's the reason, anyone know?
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:30:49
Exactly! What happens if fucked up my tires and need new tires, I’ll most likely be out of moneys for food lol
Don’t have emergency funds xD I probably should but nawww BTC has my back lol the $50 dream!
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:00:32
Ikr it sounded great but a year later nothing
@_date: 2019-12-31 18:25:46
There isn't a "program" per se...
Find an exchange that does it, coinbase is the only one I know of xD
PayPal, hm not recommended but you sell BTC for PP :P
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:10:50
