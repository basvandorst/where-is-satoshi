idk why but I️ started going through just your comments after reading a comment from you posted and dude... you are a terrible, terrible person. You just told a kid going to school for nursing to reconsider his career choice because of his limited salary cap. Do you realize how wrong you actually are?
Yes, base level RN has a “limited salary cap” of idk , half a million ? Travel nurses in sf we’re making crazy bank and worked 3 days a week.
CRNA? 125k starting?
Even then... the world needs nurses . Money isn’t everything . Teachers, nurses, firefighters , skilled workers, etc are absolutely a necessity for our economy and our country. 
Fuck you honestly dude all your comments are you berating people. You’re a terrible person and need to reconsider how you treat people.
And Incase you care I’m in sales and do very well for myself. But Fuck you.

Im not using coinbase . It's just sending my funds back to Coinbase via Overstock.com.
I use blockchain app to send and I use the QR code.

So I'm a believer in Bitcoin, but isn't this an issue? I have to go on a website to learn about how much exactly I need to include in a transaction. If this is to become widely adopted, something like this has to be done via the app, or wallet, no? I don't feel like doing freaking math for every single transaction I do.
Is this a common concern of bitcoin and is there anything being done to fix and automate it?

A conservative estimate is having bitcoin at 50k  in 1 year? 
Are y'all hearing this shit?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:05:49
Pretty much this. But meh, who isn't?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:34:29
Maybe I will write them and suggest they show what is enough.
Also, I am using blockchain to send my bitcoin. However, Overstock automatically refunds bitcoin into your email address on file at Overstock.com to Coinbase. Weird.

Why is this subreddit okay with posts like this? I swear, every day a post like this gets upvoted to over 400.
The conversations getting upvoted should be about the tech, future of the crypto, news related to BTC. 
Instead we just hear "This is how I bought shit by selling my bitcoin".
FFS this subreddit is becoming shit.

I dont know if I can trust a site who can't read a graph. The line is clearly marking December and the point of the graph marking 14,000 is clearly past December! Blasphemy!

Also, thank you for the website. Sorry I forgot to thank you.

I would hardly say nurses have a low salary cap man, that's what I am trying to tell you. You can make money doing ANYTHING in this world. Good money. If you are a typical RN working at a hospital, sure you're capped. But with a nursing degree you can easily make 6 figures. You can also get advanced education with a nursing degree and make well over 6 figures as a CRNA or a nurse practioner , etc. 
You don't know these peoples' lives.
You're just a dick from your post history. Stop berating people man, worry about your own life and your own goals.  No reason to attack anyone.

This could be quite possibly, the worst video I've ever watched. It's not even an evolution of bitcoin it's like an extremely low level understanding of bitcoin... 
Sorry this is harsh but lol come on

Uhhh it hasn’t dropped 20%, it’s up on the day over 10% so their 100$ would be like 110$ or 115$ for what it’s worth. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:13:21
Shit post fuck wtf did you even look at the pie chart?!

This guy talking about putting 30-50$ in a month. Kids probably 16 has had his 300$ turn into 1,000$ and thinking of quitting his minimum wage job. Let the kid live the dream.
Live on kid, live on.
If you're above 16, spend the money on a grammar / English class 8) then bitcoin . Profit.
