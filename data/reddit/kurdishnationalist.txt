No, these 600 prices are a scam lol.
I bet the exchange staff members are on this, they just buy cheap coins at Mt, and sell at their own exchanges. 
Like I said: Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. 
You're an incredible moron if you buy bitcoin at $600, it's true value at this moment is nothing more than $200.
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:28:15
And scammers and liars like the Bitcoin community on Bitcointalk and communities that act like Bitcoin is so fucking great and will beat the existing systems, setting up traps for noobs.
Bitcoin is just one huge ponzi scheme. Only those who entered early have profited, everyone else has lost. No way people are buying back into this again, it can only last that much. And after MtGox, HALF A BILLION stolen (I believe the GREATEST ONLINE THEFT IN HISTORY), Bitcoin won't recover anymore. 
It will continue to dump. It will be sub $100 by February 2015.

To make money of course. And to donate to political organizations I believe in and set up an institution myself. Bitcoin is a means to an end. If I were in power, I would outlaw the use of Bitcoin (don't even ask why, read the sentence again &amp; you'll understand) &amp; get back to the gold standard (I don't like or trust fiat and banks either). I don't see Bitcoin succeed in the long run. Too vulnerable, most people don't care about it, there are many digital currency alternatives, too much of a hassle for normal people to care, etc. It will probably skyrocket a few more times before it dies. I'll cash out my coins once it reaches a desirable amount. I am not delusional.

It's not only about the price... sure. But it is the most important thing.
Like, if Bitcoin could be divided into sections of importance.
Price: 90% (or more) of importance. Everything else: 10% (or less).
Nobody knows what the price will do, but Bitcoin going down from $1200 to almost sub $300 should give you (at least; if you're using your BRAINS) a good idea.

Jihadi sub? We have army leaders in our family, family members of our are in the Kurdish parliament, my father has done more against Islamists and Saddam Ba'athists than 10,000 US soldiers combined. My aunt's neighbor sentenced Saddam Hussain to death, one of my father's best friends is the general of the Zerevani Special forces &amp; a family member of ours is married to the President's niece (Barzani). Other family members are linked to the Prime Minister's family. There have been fewer terrorists attacks in Kurdistan than in Europe since 2003. We wiped out the Ansar Al-Islam forces within 1 week, while the US forces are still getting their ass fucked by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Kurdish female fighters are slaughtering Al-Nusra &amp; ISIS forces in West (Syrian) Kurdistan and have managed more with their outdated weapons than Assad &amp; his ally Russia combined. Kurdish Intelligence Agency had the decisve information which lead to the capture of Osama Binladen.
And you tell me to go to a jihadi sub, you stupid fat fuck? I can say, with ultimate confidence, that my family has done more in the war against Islamists than 10,000 US soldiers combined.

Reliability of bitcoin exchanges - all of them - is completely gone.

First 600, then 750? I hope you didn't lose everything. You should take extra measures to secure your Bitcoins and spread them over multiple wallets and devices. I am (unfortunately) not an early adopter, but I am paranoid when it comes to the security of the BTC I own. I don't have 750 BTC (I wish), but if I had, I would spread them over (at least) 15 different devices/cold wallets. I hope you're doing OK.

No, that had nothing to do with the new announcement. I believe that drop happened because they announced no more deposits will be allowed.

You got fucked in World War I and decided it was a good idea to vote for the Nazi's. THe Nazi's promised you to get rid of the Jews, but what actually happened was that you got fucked AGAIN. And not to mention that your country was divided.
Germany is still divided. I have spoken to many Germans and according to them the Germans from the West view the Germans from the East (and South) as ''backward racists''. Hahaha. 
The next time you decide to tell someone ''how backward and dysfunctional'' they are, look at yourself. You Germans always had ideas of superiority. You are delusional! It destroyed your country and nation. 
You know, they always talk about the 6 million Jews who were murdered by your savage ancestors. But did you know more Germans were killed during WW2? 8 to 9 million Germans were killed, your country was divided, and you never really recovered.

It is a well known fact that the ratio of criminals using bitcoins for their crimes, is a lot higher than the ratio of criminals using fiat. 
Fiat is of course used by criminals, etc. to run their criminal businesses. But people forget that it is not about the volume of people, but about the percentage. Of course, overall, more criminals use fiat. For every bitcoin holder who holds at least 1 bitcoin (0.1 etc. don't count, that's just too low to compare to world population fiat holders, everyone, even third world countries, are worth more than 0.1 bitcoins at the moment), there are probably millions of fiat holders. 
I am willing to bet money that if 1% of fiat users/holders has criminal purposes, at least 30% of bitcoin users/holders has criminal purposes. 
Bitcoin exists only 3-4 years, and the LARGEST ''BANK/EXCHANGE'' HEIST &amp; HACK IN HISTORY IS ON A BITCOIN RELATED BUSINESS NAME (MtGox).

Grow the fuck up dude. Lots of people have been raped by Bitcoin. 
A few days ago, I purchased 10 Bitcoins at $440 each. Price is currently like $70 lower.
Woop, another $700 USD loss in a matter of days. 
I thought I was doing a good thing, lowering my cost-average. But no. 
I don't even care anymore. It's because of assholes like you, who try to ridicule every article that warns for the risks that come with bitcoin, that noobs continue to fall for it &amp; buy (only to be dumped on by guys like you).
Article is 100% correct.
Yes, I keep my Bitcoins. No point in selling now. But I am honest; Bitcoin was and is a crappy investment (at least for 95% of holders. Only the 5% **very early** adopters have profited from it).

They are a platinum member of the Bitcoin Foundation.
According to their website: 
It costs $100,000 to become a Platinum Member. And their certificate is not the only thing that expired. Their webshop is also unavailable.
- SSL certificate expired (?)
- Magento shopping cart expired (?)
- Their webhosting expired (?)
All at the same time? And they didn't bother to fix it? They have money to pay 100K to become a platinum member, but they don't have (tops) 300 USD to pay so their website &amp; security is up-to-date, so that the 100K they spend for platinum is not worthless?

Exactly. And isn't about that. is mainly about downvoting things which are bad for bitcoin's price &amp; making fun of established traders (like Warren Buffett) because they criticize bitcoin. 
If bitcoin wants to succeed, a few things have to change:
- The community behind it needs to grow the fuck up. 
- There should be some control regarding its volatility, but I am not sure if this is possible as most bitcoins are owned by a small percentage of all bitcoin holders.

Bitcoin can not be regulated. I think the hearing will be negative.
How are they going to regulate bitcoin? Wasn't the purpose of bitcoin decentralization? Regulation means centralization. And that can't be with bitcoin, there is no way to control it. The US government will reject it, just like China did. 
I think bitcoin has grown too fast. It's scaring governments, so they'll draw different conclusions, they will stop it for now, and continue researching bitcoin behind the scenes while bitcoin slowly but steadily recovers.

Ok, then stop being such a moron by claiming that it happens with fiat money. It doesn't happen with bitcoin when you keep your bitcoins in your own wallet/cold storage. It doesn't happen with fiat money either when you keep it in cash. And this is a withdrawal limit (500 GBP), if you want to withdraw more, you just fill in a form and you can get whatever you want.
This withdrawal limit is an atm withdrawal limit. ATM's are not stuffed with billions of dollars. This limit is put in place so the ATM isn't emptied after 30 minutes.

Nationalism isn't the same as Nazism. Nationalism is similar to patriotism (patriotism is passive, nationalism is a little bit aggressive). 
I am not an ultra-nationalist. The most important reason for my nationalism is to counter Turkish fascism, Arab chauvinism and Islamofascism. These barbaric nations (Turks, Arabs and Persians) have committed many genocides and massacres against our nation, and, unfortunately, nationalism is the only way to counter their brutal, savage, and inhumane prosecution and discrimination of Kurds and people of other ethnic/religious backgrounds.

Also don't put too much value into companies accepting bitcoin. Companies need money. There is absolutely no way that the traditional currency will be replaced with bitcoins everywhere. Companies, like Zoverstock, need security and funds to finance their business. 
They accept bitcoin because it carries less costs. Companies who receive bitcoins, will trade in their bitcoins (once they have a lot) for bitcoins.
- Zoverstock started accepting bitcoins. After a year, they might have 50,000 bitcoins. Next year, BTC value is around $3,000 (or more). Zoverstock - and many other companies who have started accepting bitcoins - decide that it is a good moment to sell their bitcoins. 
Bitcoin crashes back to a few hundred dollars. Hundreds of thousands of people will start buying up those coins (or the same companies will immediately buy them back), or spend the bitcoins they have left at the companies who just sold their bitcoins. The companies start collecting bitcoins again until it reaches a new all-time-high, followed by a dump.
This cycle will repeats itself. A very nice way for companies to make money very quickly.

But in Germany... there is no pride left in Germany. Most Germans are ashamed to tell foreigners they are proud to be German because they are afraid to be judged. Do you know why? Because you didn't only loose the war. You also lost control over your own institutions and education!

Very well written post. The losers here like to deny it, but everything he has written is true, all of that happened. And it will continue to happen. Bitcoin will never be a widely accepted currency. The companies that accept bitcoin, transfer it to fiat automatically, it's just another (extra) payment method to them, nothing else. Bitcoin's popularity has calmed, a lot of people have lost money and they will continue to spread the word about the dangers. US government won't regulate it, it is banned in China and Russia. I predict that the ''ultimate'' bubble pop will be somewhere mid-3rd quarter of 2014, I expect the price of 1 bitcoin to be sub $10. A new rally will begin by that point, and everything will start again. But a real currency? No, never. Ever.

It's the top comment and I've seen similar comments appear in this subreddit over time. So it's not an unpopular opinion. The fact that ''Warren Buffet posts'' constantly make it to the frontpage of this subreddit says enough. All those posts are always extremely critical, or people simply make fun of him ''What does he know about technology?'', ''He is a fool who doesn't understand money!'', etc. Completely ignoring the fact (among other things) that his net worth is 14 times larger than Bitcoin's entire market cap. 
It's unfortunate that the Bitcoin community, in general, ignores/ridicules almost every critical opinion and post. I sincerely hope that Bitcoin takes off and that every single bitcoin will be worth $100k or more (I've invested a lot of money, currently at a +/- $18k loss). But (almost) every time I post something critical I am labeled ''a troll'' and down voted.

@_date: 2014-11-22 09:46:15
It doesn't matter what the magnitude is. If Bitcoin's price becomes too much, or reaches a point it is profitable to sell, people will sell and the price will go down.
What do you think people will sell for? You can bash fiat currencies all you want, but people measure the price of Bitcoin in dollars, and people measure their wealth and profits in dollars, not in Bitcoin. 
Everyone waits for the right moment to sell &amp; cash out in DOLLARS. 
That's one of the main reasons Bitcoin's price couldn't hold for even a month above $1k. 
And this time it will be much harder for Bitcoin to reach $1k. Last time, most people just let it go up and up because they bought much lower, they were maximizing their profits.
But right now, tens of thousands of people are in a loss (especially after MtGox happening). Most will probably sell the minute they break even to exit Bitcoin trading. 
There are thousands of nervous people holding Bitcoin. Most of them just hope to make their money back, none of them cares about anything else. 
Bitcoin goes up $50, but goes down a $100.
It's almost sub $300 again. What was the last low? $290 or something?
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:18:53
No, bitcoin is not going up. Stop acting like bitcoin is competing with major, recognized world currencies. It is not. Bitcoin is in fact just going down, it is in an obvious downtrend and investors are losing trust because of the exchanges problems. Yuan going down won't change this. Grow up and become realistic.
@_date: 2014-10-01 16:47:42
What an ignorant statement. There is a need for more than one crypto currency. Anyone who says that's not true, doesn't know what he is talking about.
The fact that at least 10 different Bitcoin projects are necessary to make ''altcoins irrelevant'', proves that. Bitcoin's success is not 100% guaranteed. 
In my opinion, you need at least 2, max 4 different crypto currencies. Preferably with different purposes. Bitcoin will probably be (primarily) used as a storage method because of its (probably) extremely high value in the future.
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:44:00
Yes... Why?
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:41:39
Hmm, not sure. 
It's listed that the max German casualties were between 3,000 - 13,300, but if you go to the ''casualties'' section, you can read that +/- 16,000 Germans surrendered (no reliable sources though). 
But I didn't look at wikipedia (for the casualties). I get ''my figures'' from books I own, it's probably a grand total of casualties.
Official German casualties (set by Fieldmarshall von Rundstedt) are 3,300. The operation (Market Garden) was way too big for that to be the total number of casualties though. 
I compared some of the wiki pages, they all list something different. 
Fuck, now I need to find a reliable source or I won't be able to sleep tonight &gt;.&lt;
Edit: ww2db (World War 2 Database) is one of the best online WW2 sources. I found this:
''With precious resources unable to advance on highway 69, Allied command decided to withdraw the forces and abandon the northern route. In the end, over 18,000 Allied personnel died or captured (compared to 13,000 German casualties) without be able to achieve securing the gateway into Germany's northern plains.''
So the number (over 18,000) is without WIA. Not sure if ''MIA'' is included though, I think it is.

Ah, the currency which was made to make the lives of the poor better. Of course a digital code which could be hacked/stolen by amateur hackers is cheap at $600 USD. I mean, what can you do with only $600? It's not like you can feed 600 starving African children with it for several days. Oh, wait. It is! But why should you do that, right? The most important thing is to pay the extremely low price of $600 USD for an easily hackable digital code and act like you do it because you stand behind the poor and support a new financial revolution. Isn't it? :)
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:57:50
Far from. Confidence doesn't restore that fast. There is still a lot of insecurity, new bitcoin stealing software is launched everyday, exchanges are shady, over 450 million USD has been lost. If you truly believe the price will stabilize already, I think you're naive and don't realize what just happened. MtGox was a serious player, and all prices reported by Media were based on MtGox. Investors joined because of those reports. And now they read that MtGox is history.

They are bullshit troll posts to you. But not to 99.9999% of the rest of the world. Most of the world thinks like me when it comes to bitcoins. That you are too close minded to even read my post (which you just stated), proves how close minded this bitcoin community is. And that's also one of the reasons why it will never succeed. 
Not only because of your close mindedness, but also because of your incredible stupidity. I am willing to bet $1000 that the average IQ of the 100,000 subscribers of this subreddit is below 95 points. Do you know why? Because of the **fact** that many of you were/are stupid enough to deposit more money into MtGox, a failed bitcoin exchange, even after withdrawals were disabled.
If you are downvoting me for having a different opinion, and if you justify downvoting me &amp; admitting that you haven't even read my posts before downvoting me simply because you think my posts are 'trollish', then you are exactly what is wrong with the bitcoin experiment. An experiment which is about to fail. And I guess I am stupid troll for saying that, right? Because you're only cool when you say nice things about bitcoin, right?

Yahoo does have servers, and their servers make backups. They wouldn't go offline if they 'got hacked'. Not only is that a very unlikely scenario, but believing that a huge company like Yahoo doesn't make backups (meaning; even if they got hacked, they would still have their servers, their servers are physical, not in the cloud or something), is just naive. 
Bitcoins are a digital code. They are not physical. When they are stolen or you lose your password, they are gone, it doesn't matter if you have a server that makes automatic backups. Even if you have backups of your wallet, if you lose your password, it doesn't matter how many backups you have.
Comparing losing emails and bitcoins is also not possible, as bitcoins are described as a 'currency', emails are not.

Yeah, and hundreds of thousands of those ''people'' have lost faith in bitcoin after MtGox. And they will discourage everyone they know and meet from entering the market after what happened to them. And a lot of people who were NOT affected by MtGox disaster, will have second thoughts (I know I have). 
At the end of the day, it really isn't about ''backing bitcoin'', but about backing your own. I bet anyone who had bitcoins in MtGox, especially those who had hundreds of bitcoins and are known for being supporters of this technology, would HAPPILY sign a contract in which is stated that they would get their coins in fiat back, but when they sign, the entire bitcoin network will collapse and everyone else will lose their money. 
Because that's human nature. Some people on act like this new technology is an utopia which will bring world peace. Fact is, most people are in it to make money. Simple as that. Capitalism at work. Don't forget that most bitcoins (by far) are owned by a few individuals, in fact the distribution is even worse compared to fiat money. So how much different is it really? 
It is a cool, new technology and money is to be made (or to be lost). That's it.

We are talking about bankruptcy of MtGox here, not about personal offline wallets. Don't try to change the subject because my arguments are better.
- If Yahoo went bankrupt, you wouldn't need to worry about your emails. 
Yahoo is a big company and even if they went bankrupt, their servers would still exist. Even if they went bankrupt, they would allow their customers to copy all their important emails before going offline forever, as that wouldn't cost them much. They wouldn't suddenly go offline like MtGox.

But the price was much higher. 
Something people forget to mention when listing all the things Bitcoin has gone through; 
- Despite the **FACT** that **MILLIONS** of people know what Bitcoin is, how it can be used, etc. the number of TRUE Bitcoin users is still extremely low and has barely increased.
Number of wallets / users doesn't say much. I am personally responsible for the creation of hundreds of wallets &amp; dozens of accounts, I barely use Bitcoin. I only trade on exchanges and my aim is: making money.
So yeah, the points you list are nice. But what could possibly trigger more Bitcoin adoption? Everything has already been done and the price continues to dump.

There are **HUNDREDS** of godaddy coupons out there **every month**. You can register a .com for between $0,99 and $3 per year with those coupons. So instead of paying $15 for 1 domain, you could get 10+ for the same price.

You're trying to give some meaning to your life, by living a fantasy and pretending to be Che Guevara. I am all for fantasies, but fantasies are fantasies for a reason: to escape reality. And sometimes, you need to wake up and face the reality; bitcoin will NEVER replace traditional currencies.

No, this is not true. When LTC skyrocketed from 12 to 48, it was mainly because the LTC/BTC ratio went up. With the LTC/BTC ratio going up, 1 Litecoin was automatically worth more USD than before because it was worth more bitcoins. BTC also rose, but not that much.

No, Bitcoin is not dead. Bitcoin is dying. 
Every time some noob yelled ''Bitcoin ded'', it was just Bitcoin dying (in process). The process will continue. The reason it has not bled to death completely is because of wealthy gamblers like Draper, start-up companies &amp; A LOT of people who invested a lot of money in Bitcoin when it was at higher levels, and who refuse to accept the reality by holding onto their Bitcoins (not realizing that the vulnerable digital code they are holding is only going down - and will continue to go down).
So, no. Bitcoin is not ''dead''. It will probably never ''die'' (as in; not being used by ANYONE). But it's definitely losing user base (increased number of wallets doesn't say anything about TRUE, ACTIVE users).

Make sure you are totally okay with losing $30,000. I have invested a similar amount into Bitcoin and I am currently down around $18,000. I am holding because selling now would be insane. But it could go down even further. 
Do your research, don't make an investment like that based on promises etc. was shouting ''$950? OMG! Cheap! Buy now.'' when it dropped from $1,200, Bitcoiners have talked a lot of people into buying (manipulated them with false promises and by heavily down voting critical posts) when BTC was high priced.

I've been holding for a long time. And yes, luck has a lot to do with it. Anyone saying that luck doesn't matter/is unimportant when it comes to trading thinks too highly of himself (or his ''skills''). Luck is definitely a factor that should be taken into account. There is a reason people buy/bought BTC &amp; LTC in the first place; they want to get ''lucky'' and make a big amount of money. Very few people buy BTC &amp; LTC with the intention to develop/improve their non-existent trading skills.

Ah, I see. There are the first downvotes. Anyway, do whatever you like.

No, you didn't provide any facts. If those are facts, provide me a link to a reliable, well known (non crypto-exclusive 'news' website) which backs up your story.
What I wrote makes sense. An over 100$+ rise in less than 7 minutes is not healthy, and nothing can justify that. If it was because of UK taxes &amp; Chinese currency, it would have reacted when that news was published, but it didn't. This rise was influenced by 1 whale, look at the bitstamp order books.
It's obvious that you do not know what you are talking about. I suggest that you go back to school and give up your ''get-rich-quick-with-crypto'' dream because even Warren Buffett slammed bitcoin today.

And yes, very small tips **IS** spam. 
I've set up an account, so all small tips are automatically added to my account. I am still bothered by it though. 
A tip = sign of appreciation. It's only logical to set a minimum tip amount. I've seen people tip $0,01 just to ridicule someone. Extremely low tips can be considered as offensive and insulting.

You can not prove that he is not him. Everything points to him. He's just afraid of FBI and CIA and is trying to save his own ass because if the government has someone to blame, they will get him and ruin his life. I mean, the creator of bitcoin made it possible to anonymously purchase childpornography, drugs, weapons, support to terrorism and launder money. It will come to an end, just watch. If you think you can beat the government and banks, you're living in a fantasy world :). They haven't even started yet. If they want to destroy bitcoin, they will end it in a matter of days. Wait until Chase, Goldman &amp; Sachs, etc. hire hackers to bug the network, or pay the core developers a ransom to bug it.

Read: ''Bitcoin market heavily manipulated. Any healthy market would respond differently to major negative news. Bitcoin doesn't. This might look like bitcoin is 'strong', but all it does is proving that the market is manipulated. Which isn't weird, as most of the bitcoins are held by a small percentage of people. The rise to $650 we saw today, was orchestrated by one single whale. Others followed, not really knowing why. When bitcoin crashes (soon), well, we'll see then. Until then, **to da moon!**.''

There''s a difference between taking risks in something promising and dumping your bank-account &amp; going all-in in a single thing that has not been proven to work yet. Remember that you're buying a digital ''code'', nothing tangible. 
What guarantee do you have that they will NEVER create more bitcoins, that the code won't be hacked/attack, etc? You don't. No one is backing it. Anyone with enough power could destroy it; nobody would be able to prosecute him either. 
Money might be printed, but you need resources, an army, a government, etc. to back you. Plus there is a real system behind it.
Every fucktard can create his own digital currency. There are dozens of digital currencies that have more features, hgher security etc. than Bitcoin. Some were probably made by 14 year old teenagers who live in their parents basement.

Exactly. The ''drop'' we saw today was probably just some panic sells. Whales bought up, and they will dump again. The ''small fish'' are the victims, some people (very few) will make a lot of money out of this disaster. And many, many more people will lose a lot of money. I think for every person that makes a profit when it all comes to a conclusion, 10-20 will have lost money. That ratio will only be increased because of MtGox going bankrupt (hundreds of thousands of customers have lost money, even if they made money on MtGox, it's all gone now).

If you want to have a serious conversation about trading, cut the childish crap and use correct words; holding, not hodling. Trap, not tarp. 
You sound like an excited 12 year old who learned a new ''funny word'' in the internet. 
And no, ''hodlers'' are not ''doing mostly ok''. 
You can continue to use the stupid argument ''You don't lose until you sell!'' but that's not really changing the reality. If Bitcoin continues to go down, ''hodlers'' can ''hodl'' until their death, but they've lost. Their original buying power has decreased. 
Someone bought 10 BTC at $1,000 each. Total investment: $10,000
Currently, 10 BTC is worth around $400 each. Total current value of investment: $4,000
$10 - $4 = $6,000 loss. 
That's the reality. It doesn't matter whether he ''hodls'' or not, his net worth is lower.

Bitcoin is not the definition of true scarcity. 
There are thousands of Bitcoin alternatives. Since Bitcoin is not centralized, you can't enforce it as ''THE'' digital currency to be used. People can switch between digital currencies whenever they like, Bitcoin is vulnerable to attacks, etc.
It seems like you think Bitcoin is some revolutionary magical currency that will change the world. It is not. A lot of ''you people'' fail to realize that Bitcoin has many disadvantages &amp; vulnerabilities.

I sound like a stubborn dick? Lol. I am just giving you facts, I look at things realistically. You do not. Everyone here thinks bitcoin is the future, but yet everyone will sell when bitcoin's value drops quickly, or reaches a good, profitable amount. Everyone here is in it to make money. Stop this ''future currency'' trash talk. If it was a currency, it would've been used more often. Most of it is dead, gets stolen, or is used to launder. Everyone else is trading on exchanges. I bet not even 5% of the bitcoins in circulation are spend at ecommerce websites. And when they are, they are usually immediately (automatically) traded for fiat. Just proves that even the merchants don't trust bitcoin, but accept it to avoid fees &amp; additional payment method. 
I will probably be downvoted, but this is just the fucking reality. I too own bitcoins. But I'll sell at a nice profit whenever I get the chance. That's how 99% of bitcoin owners think, but few say it outloud. 
It's not like I own just 0.5 bitcoins, I own a considerable amount. And I have absolutely no faith in its future. I laugh when people talk about bitcoin becoming $10,000 each, you'd be happy if the current price +/-10% holds upcoming months. I expect a huge crash, I think the price will settle around 250-350 dollars.

- Charlie Lee works at Coinbase &amp; recently announced some sort of new way to accept Litecoin via Coinbase
- Litecoin is established, 3 years old --&gt; All other altcoins are either dead or die quickly, are not that old, or have a very small community/development etc.
- If Bitcoin goes up, the ''normal people'' will prefer 1 full Litecoin over 0.000003 Bitcoin, demand for LTC will go up.

I am talking with some Kurdish investors, but it's hard convincing them to invest in Bitcoin (related projects).
I assume this doctor of yours works in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, and not in the Arab districts. The economy in the Kurdistan Region is booming (while the rest of Iraq is ''booming''), there are a lot of new millionaires. Some of my family members have made tens of millions of $ since the US liberation in 2003. 
But their mindset is quite ''old scool''. They care about gold, cash and real estate. Bitcoin doesn't really live there. But if there is a place in central Middle-East to launch some Bitcoin related industry/companies, it's in the Kurdistan Region. It's safe, tolerant &amp; there are a lot of opportunities.
But people don't really know about Bitcoin (yet). I know some people who pay hundreds of dollars (and sometimes even more) in fees to transfer money. Bitcoin would be ideal to compete with Kurdistan's cash society (banks aren't that developed yet, it's mainly a cash &amp; gold culture. People walk with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash in the bazaar).

- People who got money there, will get their money back. 
- Getting the criminals easier (witnesses, chasing, video camera's, money can be traced, etc. )
With bitcoin:
- You don't get your money back.
- Criminals won't be chased, even if there is evidence, there is nothing you can do. 
- No government institution is backing you, you are on your own. 
- It is a lot easier to steal bitcoins than money from a bank. You don't need guns, a plan, insiders, etc. to rob a bank and make a few bucks, everyone can anonymously steal your life savings from their comfortable home. 
What are you trying to do with your silly post? Get upvotes and use this as an argument to say USD is dangerous? Anything that has value is subject to criminal activity, but the fact is (unfortunately), that bitcoin is more associated with it than the USD is. The USD keeps the world going, bitcoins were primarily used to feed criminals &amp; for illegal purposes. That might have changed, but the fact is that bitcoins are still unsafe. 99.99% of the world population probably wouldn't know how to even begin, let alone taking a huge risk to lose their money. Stop saying it is easy to secure your wallet, I know it is, I have bitcoins too, but it took a while before I figured it out, and most people won't bother. They don't care, traditional currency is probably good enough for them!

It's not a currency. You used it to purchase a gift card, you used that gift card (which represents fiat money) to purchase your product. 
And even if you used bitcoin directly on Amazon, it's still not a currency, as the business would trade the bitcoins in for real fiat money/currency IMMEDIATELY (what BitPay basically does). 
If it was a real, valid currency with at least a little bit of reliability, businesses wouldn't have to trade it in. They would keep it and use it to purchase their stock. But they don't.

Market has not really responded yet, some people panic sold which caused the price to go down a little bit and recover.
The price is already at the same rate as before the MtGox shutdown, but this is manipulated. A genuine market never recovers that fast from major bad news. Over 400,000,000 USD worth of bitcoins have been stolen, that's +/- 7% of all bitcoins in circulation. Besides that, a new virus to steal bitcoins etc. was just 'launched', the FBI has yet to sell their 144,000 bitcoins, Silk Road 2.0 was 'hacked', and DDOS attacks happen on all exchanges (poor security). 
Not to mention the fact that many bitcoin investors have lost all faith in bitcoin after what happened to MtGox.
MtGox is just delaying the 'real' crash by publishing a non-statement on their website. Once they 'confirm' that it is REALLY gone, expect the worst to happen.
You can't possibly be so naive to believe that 400 MILLION USD is gone, and that the bitcoin trust already returned/price restored. In what, a 12 hour period? 
The media will go insane. Not only this week, but the upcoming weeks. I expect governments to take additional measures against bitcoin, and banks will probably block transactions to bitcoin related websites after the Gox debacle. 
This isn't over yet, today we only saw a preview of what will happen the upcoming few weeks. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:01:18
I think the recent massive transactions on MtGox are Karpeles &amp; other MtGox staff member transactions who will dump their coins on an exchange soon. 
The OP of the post linked in my OP could be 'working' for them. Anyway, one thing is sure: it caused the price to go up, and IF it was MtGox withdrawing all coins in preparation of a dump, a lot of people will lose a lot of money soon (even more than before, since it was pumped by fake news/ false hope created by the OP of ''some light on the horizon'').

Do you now realize how retarded your last sentence is? More people have had their lives ruined because they purchased Bitcoin compared to Litecoin. Remember MtGox? Noobs: MtGox was a major Bitcoin exchange. It went bust last year. Over $500,000,000 (half a BILLION) worth of Bitcoins were stolen. The greatest ''digital'' theft in history. 
Be careful. Bitcoin is not going to make you rich quick. So far, Bitcoin has mostly destroyed lives (the people advocating Bitcoin bought in early, they WILL dump on you. Don't be a fool. Stay clear from Bitcoin AND altcoins. They are ponzi schemes).

This is true. You people should stop fighting it, China is the major leading force behind Bitcoin's rising value. We all know what happened the last time major negative news came from China... The prices restored and stabilized a little bit, but that's mainly because of the Chinese exchanges strategy, they managed to restore the trust - at least for a while. 
You have to realize China is not like the United States, Germany or any other Western country. When they say it is illegal to trade bitcoins, and when they impose a law which prohibits exchanges/third party payment providers to trade in bitcoin - then that's the final judgment. 
And believe me, most Chinese individuals will stop trading bitcoins when their government tells them to stop. You see, China is not a leftist, pro-human rights, democratic, tree hugging country. If they see a threat, they will deal with that threat, and anyone who supports that threat. You will end up in prison, or worse. That's the reality. 
To be honest, anything could happen on/around January 31st. But it doesn't look good.

Gay rights? Are you serious? Kurds have been oppressed and genocides have been committing against us since 1921, we have some freedom back since 2003, do you really think ANYONE in Kurdistan is thinking about gay rights with all the other shit going on? 
In North-Kurdistan (South-Eastern Turkey), the dominant Kurdish party does support LGTB rights (only part that does, BDP). It's not socially accepted, but they aren't oppressed and there aren't laws etc. against them. Nobody cares really cares, they let them be. 
And there is freedom of speech. Could be improved, but there is more freedom of speech in the KRG than all other Middle-Eastern countries, Israel excluded.

No, that is not what my post implies. I use the ''moon'' because the success of Bitcoin is generally related to its price. And it MUST be related to its price because of its limited supply. Because an increased value per Bitcoin, means an increased market cap, increased market cap means more dominance. Bitcoin price going down is NOT good for Bitcoin. I don't care how many famous people announce their support for Bitcoin, or how many start-ups are created. For Bitcoin to succeed, the price MUST rise.

I think this is bull shit. There was some article about BTC China and some other Chinese exchange adding Litecoin. OKCoin is known for having the largest LTC volume of all exchanges. OKCoin is also known for faking data. The fact that this newsitem is published several days before Huobi starts trading Litecoin, is very suspicious to say the least.
Litecoin has become a very obvious pump and dump coin. It was pumped from $12 to 4 times that value within several hours a few months ago. Now it is back to the $10-$20 range and it fluctuates every day. The recent ''litecoin is being added to multiple Chinese exchanges'' news has pushed the btc/ltc price up a bit, but I am almost sure that this is only short-term. 
I also don't know why everyone is so excited about bitcoin related news from China. Just a few months back, China was like the omen to bitcoin. Constant negative news from China made the price of ALL cryptocurrency drop, and I believe the Chinese government even banned trading bitcoins, and/or depositing/withdrawing money to/from Chinese exchanges.
So why exactly is ANYONE excited about this non-news?
@_date: 2014-09-27 21:37:21
It's not hard for companies to accept Bitcoin. Setting up Coinbase or BitPay  etc. really takes just a few minutes. And I am pretty sure Coinbase and BitPay are more associated with Bitcoin than PayPal is, so if I was a business, I would trust a payment processor like Coinbase or BitPay before PayPal. 
Anyway, what does this mean for the consumer? More fees? Coinbase etc. charge a fee, but if they work with PayPal, PayPal will also charge a fee. So isn't this defeating the purpose of Bitcoin? Before we know it, Bitcoin fees will be equal or almost the same as Credit Card fees.

I didn't invest in bitcoin to make quick cash &amp; buy a car or TV. You wouldn't understand it.

No coins can be used on Amazon at the moment. Advantage of Litecoin is:
* It's faster than Bitcoin
* It has more growth potential. During the last ''bubble'', Litecoin went up much more than Bitcoin percentage wise
* Litecoin creator is known and respected member of the cryptocurrency community, he's also active on Reddit (whereas the creator of Bitcoin is **unknown** and holds a large amount of Bitcoin. 
* Litecoin was not pre-mined
* Litecoin has the largest/most active and strongest network (and thus safest) next to Bitcoin
* Scammers are more active in the Bitcoin community than Litecoin community (Over $700,000,000 worth of Bitcoin stolen so far)
Also, Litecoin is cheaper. You could spend $12 on 10 Litecoins or $12 on 0.06 Bitcoins. The 10 Litecoins looks better :).
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:14:41

I agree with you, 99% of users on are 12 year olds who will laugh at a penis drawing. Everything anti-bitcoin gets downvoted, even before reading the content. Everything pro-bitcoin gets upvoted, even without reading the content. 
Just try it. Make a title like: Bitcoin Accepted Again In China! 
And post extremely negative/anti-bitcoin information in your opening post. You'll see that in the beginning you'll get a lot of upvotes, until people realize that it was a trap. 
That's how close minded and childish this community is. 
One of the reasons why bitcoin will fail. Everyone is lying for their own gains. They act like they care, but 99% are just hoarders/holders who will not spend a single bitcoin online. They're just waiting for a good moment to sell for FIAT - because we all know what really matters, dollars and euros and pounds. That's what buys shit, not some digital code that isn't backed by anything &amp; can be hacked by any amateur hacker.

Litecoin is not a copy. Litecoin is more secure than Bitcoin. Litecoin is faster than Bitcoin. Litecoin's owner is known and reliable. Litecoin is not associated with thousands of scams. Litecoin is not premined. Litecoin has the 2nd most development.

All cryptocurrency have been going down for over a year. Entire End of 2013 + entire 2014 + beginning of 2015 = all major cryptos going down (BTC, LTC, Doge). It looks like it won't stop for a while (and maybe never, this could be the end). Anything is possible, but it doesn't look good.

It's better if you invest in Litecoin. Litecoin is cheaper and the chance that someone steals your Litecoins is smaller than someone stealing your Bitcoins.
Also, this sub is very unfriendly towards people with different opinions. A few days ago they were celebrating the financial loss of people who invested in other crypto-currencies (look it up, it even went to the frontpage).
The only reply you got from a Bitcoiner so far is a generic comment with a link to/mention of ''bitcoin.org''.
Most people (80%+) of this subreddit only care about their own Bitcoin community. When they talk about how digital currencies are going to change the world, they actually mean bitcoin only. They are exactly like the bankers/governments they despise so much, but their own ignorance has blinded them. They complain about how governments etc. prevent new innovations (like the blockchain technology) from succeeding in order to protect the established status quo (US dollar). But they are, at the same time, trying to ruin other crypto-currencies (like Litecoin) by talking trash about it, demonizing it, and even going as far as spreading FUD on litecointalk.org &amp; People at are still helpful. The creator of Litecoin (is also active in that subreddit. Also less spam.
Another 'plus': you can buy a whole Litecoin without spending an arm and a leg. It's true, you can buy fractions of a bitcoin, like 0.001 bitcoin. But that's not what the human mind prefers ;). 
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:30:55
I know that.
But Bitcoin and Litecoin are really dying. 
BTC &amp; LTC have been going down for more then a year. LTC used to be $50 and now only $2. BTC used to be $1250 and now only $270. Hundreds of millions pumped into startups didn't help. People like Draper buying up thousands of coins didn't help either. Microsoft, etc. accepting Bitcoin didn't help the price.
So... what's going to push the price back up? The Bistamp hack certainly is not going to help.
It's dying. You're all in denial. LTC never $5, BTC never $500 again.
It is over.... The war is lost.
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:51:04
Read my comment again. But this time, use your brains. 
Edit: I doubt you'll be able to understand it (just like the other 3 brain-dead 12 year old's who upvoted your comment), so here it comes: I invested to make more money, money I planned on (partially) donating to the PYD &amp; relief for Yezidi refugees. The rest would go towards a politically-oriented &amp; journalism-related project. None of it was meant for personal use, but all of it was personal money. This might sound weird to you, but there are causes I stand behind/support and losing over $30,000 that could've went towards those projects and causes hurts. I didn't expect Bitcoin fascists whose only goal is to lure noobs into investing in bitcoin &amp; creating false hope to understand this though. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:09:54

That's just one of the possible options I have listed. They could come up with ''we have been hacked'', or just don't announce anything at all.
MtGox knows one thing for sure: they're still making money (fees), and they still possess a lot of coins.
As Bitcoin isn't backed by a government, and as governments have already pointed out the risks of trading bitcoins, it is very likely that MtGox will use this to cover their ass.

- Extreme volatility

- Mainly used on the dark web
- Why would they buy it? Doesn't add anything!
- Not really ''tangible'' like dollars or euros

I apologize for making a minor spelling mistake. You see, I speak, write and understand 5 languages fluently. Sometimes, I make a mistake. But I am sure you understand more languages than I do. I mean, why would you even dare to criticize me if you don't?

Thank you for helping me out :).
One last question: is Multibit reliable wallet software?
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:38:40
Thanks for your reply. 
I have printed out my passwords and placed them in a secure place, I deleted the word &amp; excel files I used to print the passwords, etc.
One thing: I have encrypted my wallets via the software (Multibit and Litecoin-Qt). I haven't encrypt the wallet.dat file (if that is even possible). But encrypting the wallet/address should be enough, right?
And I am planning on using 2 or 3 USB sticks to make my backup. I won't make online backups, just cold storage.

What do you advise me to do? 
Is a 18-22 random password safe enough? 
Is a anti-virus scanner necessary on an Apple Macbook?
