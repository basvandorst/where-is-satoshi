Britain uses pounds and p with no problem.  p stands for pence.
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:24:28
It looks delicious!  Hope you enjoyed, and I hope I can order a carryout from the UK with bitcoins soon.  :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:25:38
You mean only registered banks can offer a traditional debit card?  Not a bitcoin wallet.  Yes, that is probably right.
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:49:33
Do you have plans to become available in the UK?  Sounds like you do eventually.  It's great to hear you are doing well, good luck. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:21:08
I hope so hard that you are right.  It seems like it is a rolling stone gathering speed...

I can't find a way to buy shares via that lmb website.  Can you give me a link or tell me how?  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:48:49
I did but I wanted to make sure it was the correct version as this is complicated.  Someone else has told me and I tipped them.  Check your attitude.

Yeah, it's very similar.  The gold has held its value and the federal reserve notes haven't.  So in theory the bitcoins will hold their value (and increase to similar price levels as gold) and any 'bitcoin notes' would not hold their value as they could be created by banks.

OP said the photo was taken at 9.37am.  Price at Bitstamp then looks to be about $338, so a mark-up of only 4.5%.  Really good - why is this not big news?
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:03:05
It's quite new.  Yes, you get password prompt when you enter the QR.  Blockchain's wallet and multibit can handle it, more will probably follow.  Or you decrypt it with bitaddress (offline version) before spending it.  It is a worthwhile extra step I think.

they might not need to go to college, they have a great business set up, and could expand it in the future.

thankyou!

Thanks.  This look great!  It's good that this is possible, hopefully more companies will start offering this.  The guy said it was difficult to find a bank to partner with so that is the problem.
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:11:41
Done, best of luck, maybe you could post the results or your presentation here when you are finished?
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:46:33
Could you tell me what should I save the offline bitaddress.org version as - 'complete' or 'html only'?  What is the difference? Or is there another way? (I right clicked then hit 'save page as')
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:50:43
Thanks.  I wasn't invisaging the online bitcoin wallet company holding any local currency though.  It would merely sell your bitcoin for you on an exchange and instantly let you spend it with your debit card.  Maybe it would require a large local currency fund to do this in real time though.  I'm not sure, I don't know the details of how credit and debit cards work.
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:55:40
could you link me to the correct download with the encryption option please?
@_date: 2013-10-22 11:59:28
the rate is predetermined.  
from wikipedia:
Currently, 25 bitcoins are generated with each block found which occurs every 10 minutes on average. This amount, called the block reward, will be halved to 12.5 bitcoins within the year 2017 and again roughly every 4 years thereafter until a hard-limit of 21 million bitcoins is reached around the year 2140. As of March 2013 over 10.5 million of the total 21 million bitcoins had been created; the current total number created is available online. In November 2012, half of the total supply was generated, and by end of 2016, three-quarters will have been generated. By around 2140, all bitcoins will have been generated with the final years producing only fractional units.

There's a much smaller transaction fee than using a credit card or paypal so more of the donation gets to where you want it to go.
@_date: 2013-09-11 03:32:32
Hooray!  Cheers to all of you.

3) A store of value akin to gold that you can actually hold yourself safer than you can hold gold  (as encrypted, password-protected, backed up, offline bitcoins)
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:46:53
To further increase security, the paper wallets should be encrypted and backed up.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:03:28
It looks like a bubble and it may be, but after the fall it will come right back up.  I'm going to hold right on through it.  I am expecting we will break $1,000 before the year is over.   Yes, I think you should withdraw your coins from Gox - but I also think Gox is pretty safe as they have made a lot of profit in bitcoin.  It is the banks causing them problems.  But the safest thing is to withdraw them and create a paper wallet (not a brainwallet).  The very safest way would be to create the paper wallet file offline, then encrypt it and store the encrypted file on 3 different memory sticks in 3 different locations.  Then if any are stolen or destroyed you have the others as back up, and even if one is stolen it is encrypted so it doesn't matter.  (maybe you think that is too much but that is what I do).  Man I hope I am right, I am so excited about this! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:47:48
Sounds like a good product.  I was wondering - is there any way to make the card act like a bank debit card and be able to spend local currency (e.g. USD).  So your Coinkite account is in bitcoins but you can use your debit card to spend USD in any store.  Or is this impossible?
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:26:05
Great news, I will try them out this week.
@_date: 2013-09-08 17:47:14


WWhat does 'hard to encrypt human readable' mean?
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:34:01


I concur with this.  If we get to $700 I will sell and buy back in after the bubble pops again (at about $200).  There are still thousands of people finding out about bitcoin and buying in, creating these bubbles. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:52:42
Date from the machine on the photo 9th November.  Price from the photo is $353.  Price at Bitstamp on that day was $341 (probably an average daily price).
@_date: 2013-10-22 11:34:19
Yes there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins.  About 12 million have been mined so far.

where do I download the bitaddress zipfile from?

why not mmm-bop?
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:23:15
There is an option to do it on the bitaddress.org website.  Or you could save the 'paper' wallet as a pdf file and encrypt it using truecrypt.  The reason for doing this is; if your paper wallet or usb stick containing the paper wallet file was stolen from your house, the theif could not spend it as it is encrypted with a password.
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:49:22
The lending bank could not issue 1000 real bitcoins though as it does not have them.  It could issue physical 'bitcoin notes' which are a claim on the real thing and could be spent like cash.  This may happen, but I'll be sticking with my real bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:41:51
Hold.  You pulled out half which was a good idea just in case things go wrong somehow.  Now you hold with the rest as long term we are almost certainly going much, much higher.  This is world changing stuff we are involved in here.  Long term bitcoins could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each as they are perfect money - much better than government fiat currencies.  The world is in a massive financial crisis and governments are printing their own currencies like crazy - a huge fiat crash is coming very soon.  Bitcoin could easily take over as it is so brilliant.  (my opinion)
@_date: 2013-09-08 17:46:07
But spreading copies out like that would mean they are more likey to get stolen don't you think?  Or are you saving an encrypted wallet on each one that only you know the password to maybe? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:55:10
Brilliant, thankyou!
@_date: 2013-10-22 11:23:07
When banks or companies default or go bankrupt the loans they have made have to be cancelled or removed as they cannot pay them.  So if you have a stock in a bankrupt company you lose it.  If you have dollars in a bank that goes bankrupt you lose them.  They are removed from the monetary system as they were loans - hence the deflation.  (You can't lose gold or bitcoin as they are not debt-based and therefore cannot deflate or disappear).
