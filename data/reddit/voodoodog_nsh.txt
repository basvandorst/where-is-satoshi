bitcoin is hardly used (compared to fiat money) and, as i said, the amount of human induced transactions is \_far\_ smaller then the ones created by bots and therefor we have a very high but only artificially created volume.
how can you be sure these things will never happen?
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:06:39
no, they are not. fiddeling around charts, adjusting commodities, timescale and dollar valuation until you find something you like
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:39:23
yea thats true and make sense game theory wise and thats why i allready go some.
but my concern comes became a thing when i thought about going much deeper and invest alot more.
to minimalize the risk of my future investment i posted this thread, because maybe i have some fundamental flaws in my thinking i wasnt aware of that would eradicate my concerns.
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:35:13
yea... that might be so.
so, over time, the ratio human transaction:bot transaction will shift towards a smaller proportion for the bot transactions? maybe fake transactinos from bots are just part of an organic growth of such a system? these would make my worries obsolete i guess.
isnt the stock market full of bot trading as well? does anyone know the ratio of bot vs human tradings there?
e: i did some more thinking. what if it doesnt matter if bots can be permitted from doing transactions or not. what if its simply enough for this to be common knowledge to worsen the general sentiment towards crypto.
after all, if this comes common knowledge the phrase "this is all nonsensical garbage, its fake and not real" becomes to \~90% true?\^\^
@_date: 2019-07-30 08:04:57
thats exactly how it works. on average you have to wait 10 minutes for your transaction to be confirmed one time.
some ppl maybe dont wait for a confirmation, knowing that a double spend is so unlikely to happen in that moment that its not worth to wait \~10minutes. they simply trust you to not screw them over by doing that.
the instances i paid with bitcoin i used the tenX card which sells my bitcoin for my currency in the moment of spending and the retailer does not know bitcoin was involved at all.
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:20:23
well, i didnt used it so far because i dont konw such a thing existed. i cant comprehend how i would put fiat into a truly DEX and i still dont get what and how u did it

@_date: 2019-11-06 11:31:59
so, how does this work, paying with fiat money?
you find someone who wants to sell btc for fiat, you tell your bank to send money to that someone and that someone sends then bitcoin to you?

what new law are they talking about?
its really scary if a european bank is able to do such a thing.
my bank (in germany) once holded on of my outgoing transactions at a time where is was going kinda deep into bitcoin. but this was just a precautious matter and i could solve it with just one call. but your thingy is next level and actually scary.
even if this ends well, change banks and get it in writing that transactions from other countries are allowed. from what country did this transaction came from anyways if you dont mind me asking?
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:37:26
i still cant feel comfortable sending money just beacuse the sellers funds are in escrow. what if the seller said he nver got the money? he gets his funds back and i lost my money. how does this not happen all the time?

Dont be fragile. Thats just how a lot of humans behave towards thing they dont understand or dont know.
You can learn alot from their behaviours tho, because bad examples are examples afterall. If you encounter anything in the future where your first impulse is to wash it off (like they do with bitcoin) you might think twice before actually doing so and having a closer look towards what ever it was you wanted to wash off so quickly. because u might be wrong.

for some reason i only read your 8th point and i think it is wrong.
lightning is certainly not more secure than (put what ever you want here). it is a test environment and in heavy development, "moving" your funds there may very well result in losing all your funds.
to say bitcoin uses lightning networks is like saying bitcoin uses atm's. u got it the wrong way around. 
also, what do you mean by censored currency? i dont think the demand for a censored currency is very high.

yea, well, thats it i guess. there is just zero chance of making these "batches" tamper proof, isnt it?
unless we figure out a way to identify every single leaf with absolute certainty, this use case is not applicable for blockchain use.
unless you lower your fault tolerance?
lets say some ppl will label this batches wrong or temper in what ever way with it. these kind of things allready are happening. if you accept these things and still implement the tracking in that kind, it might be an improvement to what ever is happening now?
so, in general, when buying chocolate, you know when the cocoa beans where processed and what ways they took until you picket them up in the supermarket.
and you want this on the blockchain rather than in a sql database, because the automated entries (sansors on the batch, the truck, the ship) are not alterable.
so, although it has flaws, it still be an improvement?

@_date: 2019-10-25 19:44:00
i kinda thought its obv, for you on a second thought at least (that wasnt meant rude, but i see ur first thougth as this topic).
so you can pack the price to a mathematical function, because the market will always determine the price. we value things today differently then tomorrow. fixing bitcoins price to an algorithm will therefore counteract natural marketforces and make it meaningless.
@_date: 2019-10-01 09:50:35
and above all is bitcoin, owned by no one, controlled by no one.

no reasonable person disses anyone with a bearish outlook.
fixating on the wrong ppl (tone and craig, both are clowns) to come to a conclusion that fits your world view isnt helpfull.
and yes, ppl are interested in bitcoin and thats why ppl spend money on it. more and more every day. how long this will take and how far will it go? i dont know nor do i really care (because i cant influence it).
you conflating the typical subreddit crowd (meme kids with mostly bad knowledge about the subject) with actual reasonable and knowledgeable ppl who make evidence based projections for the future.
i high suggest reading the bitcoin standard to get a different perspective. 2/3 of the book arent about bitcoin, they are about the current monetary system, how it came to be and why it is bad for society.
@_date: 2019-10-06 12:34:28
so your saying you invented an algorithm that trades better than everyone else?  
AMAZING man, so with that your infinite rich, right?
why would u share that knowledge and create competitors for yourself tho?
i guess scam shit like this will be alive and well as long enough new ppl, which are hungry to get rich quick, flood the space?
@_date: 2019-10-29 12:53:31
well, ofc i do not want everyone to enter anything there. these entries in the blockchain would come from sensors on the batch-crates, the trucks, the ships and happen automatically when certain criteria are met. when the truck leaves the processing factory, the sensors on the cartes notice that and an entry is created. this is ofc just an estimation, the point is, this might very well be possible to accomplish.
if a sensor is stolen or destroyed or what ever, these are all things that can be figured out. when a batch arvies without an entry on every stage of its way, it is discarded because it does not fit the quality standards and will be sold for 5cents at aldi.
@_date: 2019-10-15 09:34:09
yes, the last one. but only on the 3rd of every month.
@_date: 2019-10-21 06:59:05
yea, i thought the same \^\^
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:16:13
yea... i can see that. 
and if i trust "them" with the sensors, i might as well trust them with an sql database. 
still, one point remains, implementing this increases the criminal energy you have to use in order to make a fraudulent documentation. changing an entry in a sql database vs changing something in the blockchain (that somehow is implemented in an immutable way without PoW :D)
@_date: 2019-10-22 18:15:21

1. yes, eventually, if you had 100 million universe lifetimes to spend.
2. btc wont go to infinity because the inflation decreases by 50% every \~4years. reaching 0 in about 100 years. it will do that because you only have 8 decimal places.
3. no, the idea is that transaction fee's will increase in monetary value in will eventually be enough to attract enough miners to secure the network
4. its not in my book.
5. ppl are biased and when u invest a huge amount of your stake into a thing, you are even more biased
6. yes

to be fair, from someone that is allready 6 years into bitcoin (twice as long as iam), i would have expected that he know's how to answer this question, namely by going to coinmarketcap and look for a historic breakdown of the volume by day.
i guess thats why most of the ppl think you are new?
this sub is full of meaningless pictures and questions like these (that could be answered by doing a 30seconds search), this generates alot of unecessary noise when trying to find quality posts that actually interests me. well, i guess that is the reason why my sentiment towards topics like this might be tainted slightly negative.

dont listen to anyone here saying yes to this. it might be a good idea, it might not be. subreddit are generally a bad place to ask questions like that, because they each can strengthen the bias bubble you are allready in. by asking this hear you will mostly get a yes answer, no matter if it actually is a good idea or not.
try out other sub's that are not so pro bitcoin, ask the same question, listen to their arguments and try to form your own decision.
also, if you invest in a thing it is generally a really good idea to educate yourself on that thing. there are alot of free available high quality sources out there you can use.

i think u should ask yourself why you are seeking other opportunities.
there is no way of getting rich quick. i try to advice everyone i know in buying bitcoin (as a hedge against our failing system). but other than that, i cant advice anyone of buying any shitcoin.
in mid 2017 i was a big neo and tenx, and later icx and stratis fan and i still hold them. but my plan is to sell every shitcoin i have with the next alt season. 
u should do the same, there is no reason to bet on any other coin than bitcoin. objectively speaking. the more time you invest in understanding this space, the earlier you will come to this conclusion.

@_date: 2019-10-15 12:54:08
a currency that isnt for saving, is not a good currency.
currencies are for hodl'ing! because saving and therefore increasing your wealth decreases your time preference, and history shows that societies with a low time preference prosper, where societies with a high time preference vanish.
the fallacy that a currency should be spended and that saving is bad, comes from the warped mind of keynesian. thats why today alot of ppl think that inflation is not a bad thing and have no issue with the devaluation of their wealth.
that said, iam spending my bitcoin since 2017.
that said again, greshams law states, that one is inclined to always spend the bad currency first. thats why i rather spend my euro, rather than my bitcoin. because bitcoin is more valuable on multiple dimensions.

although thats true, i think the ratio of the amount of money we have on our bank accounts vs the amount of money we own and dont have on our bank accounts might be the same. therefore if banks say "no, not more then 100€ per day for you"-smth we would be equally screwd.
i think australia or even europe play with such laws, dont they?
emergency law that would legally allow every bank to restrict transactions to a very low amount per day/week for every customer.

i would love to spend and replace (with a crypto card for example from tenx). because with that you, on average, spend less for everything.
lets say i spend 500€ per month on anything (fuel, food etc). instead i buy bitcoin with these 500€ at a price of 10 000€ per bitcoin.
now i spend those bitcoin instead with my tenx card (buying gas etc). when the btc price appreciates (which it does more often than not) i'll have not 500€ worth of bitcoin to spend, but, lets say, 600€. so after spending my usual 500€ on anything for the month, i still have some btc leftover, because the price appreciates.
do this every month and u'll save alot of money if the price appreciates more often then not.
i did this in 2017, bought everything with the card and it felt really really good to do so. maybe an irrational feeling, but nevertheless a really good feeling and i want to do it again.

in my estimation its purpose is to be a validation network in which you dont need to trust a third party and with that it is the foundational layer for so many applications who exactly need that. money beeing the first of such applications.
but once we solve (how ever we are going to do that) the "bullshit in"-problem, things like property rights (basically everything that is today in some database saved by a third party to determine who owns what) can be displayed on bitcoin, unalterable, uncensorable and undeniable. once this kind of thing is established (in the far future i would say), we are in for a new area of prosperity.

yea, increasing the amount of satoshis by 10 is nothing to worrie about.
@_date: 2019-10-29 15:06:41
well, i wrote 99.999% because litecoin is valueable just as a testbed for future bitcoin implementations (and ofc when bitcoin hits 10 million, we need litecoin because 1 satoshi will be to big of a unit) and maybe monero (for what ever?). i dont know i just like fluffy pony.

is there a sub for bitcoin discussions without  unfunny pictures allowed?
@_date: 2019-10-23 08:53:20
another bullrun because banks.
no, not because banks will buy bitcoin, but because banks suck and ppl will want to have a hedge against them.
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:23:39
how about something like "buying a sip" (or something that sounds a lil bit smoother\^\^) where u make the B from buying in form of a bitcoin and the sip is somehow incorporated into a cup of coffee.
you know like in buying coffee with bitcoin and stuff. buying a sip - soon tm.

thats a way to simplistic view in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-10-05 20:44:07
well, thats technically correct. but dont you think that if such a thing would happen, that banks would try to stop the electronic run on "cash"with a "no more than 100$ per day can leave your bank account in any way"-policy?
what happend in those countries that undergo a bankrun where everyone tried to "save"cash by withdrawing it, could citizen move their money digitally? i allways thought that would be impossible as well.
@_date: 2019-10-17 14:32:28
if that will ever be, we kinda have a problem, have we not? when 1btc is 2m, 1satoshi will be 2 cents. what if i want to buy something with 1cent?
ahh, maybe litecoin, eh? okay, problem solved, thanks for listening.

how does one determine reliable between real volume and fake bot trading tho (coinmarketcap trading volume of binance is twice as high as the one from your site)? 
e: also this only adds up 11 exchanges. so it is far less realistic than someone adding up, lets say, 400 exchanges?

nice statement, which you cant back up a assume?
what is meant by meat production? fabricated meat? only grass fed grass finished beef?
how do you know that the "meat production"he was talking about is actually bad for the planet?
how do you quantize "bad for the planet"?
its just so easy to brush this of and label a guy something bad because you dont agree with him.
but i bet you didnt put any thought into it what so ever :(
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:32:41
that is a rather naive question i would say, for the following reasons:
1st) the chinese government taking over every mining facility in china is a \_much\_ more complex task than one would think,
2nd) these are pools, if it where common knowledge that one of those pools would be compromised, ppl would be incentivized to leave said pool and go to an uncompromised pool. because if they dont, they risk hurting the very thing that provides their income
iam sure one could come up with much more reasons that this should not be nr 1 of your list of concerns, but iam at work and i have to go now.
@_date: 2019-10-16 11:09:08

indeed. so with current knowledge, not 99% but 99.9% of all altcoins will fail. probably 99.999%
@_date: 2019-10-23 11:11:27
right now most ppl buy bitcoin to get a lambo tomrrow, yes.
but i put my euros out of the banking system into the bitcoin system because i genuinely believe that in my lifetime our system will fail and what ever savings i have in fiat will be worthless. i also believe this will happen rather sooner then later.
i would buy gold as well, but the hassle to make sure that one acquires real gold is just not worth it (yet) in my opinion.
but yes, right now and for western countries, you are totally right.
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:11:49
well, you know twitter. the smartest ppl i know do dumb shit on twitter. taking this to serious might not be a good idea. anyways, i think he is right on the cow thing. every research into things like "how to make cows less fart" to save the earth is just beyond stupidity.
alarmism in general is in my opinion as bad as dogmatism. swing the bells, cry around without any proof of what your warning everyone for what so ever.  this whole climat thing is super complicated and separating the facts from the politics is really hard to do. but by that cow logic, walking to fast is also bad for the planet, because we produce more co2. so please stop jogging folks.
but you are right, the amount of meat that we eat is obv to much. fabricated meat should be forbitten. but thats a whole other discussion.
iam currently reading a book you might be interested in, too. Steven Pinker, Enlightenment now. It talks about the warped perception of way to many ppl that everything is become worse and worse (more deforestation, more dead animals, more rape etc) and proofs them wrong.
today we have more trees in the northern hemisphere then 100 years ago for example. we have less war, less horror and live a much better life then ever before.
and to your last paragraph, even if he did say something of that sort and meant it in the worst possible way, that does not make his other statemens false automatically. dont atttack the person, attack his ideas. i think the "ideas" in the bitcoin standard are well worth listening to, since they are a (not so well known anymore) descripttion of how to get out of the mess we are currently in.

@_date: 2019-10-15 12:20:25
define what you mean by worth.
for some it is worth going into bitcoin, no matter the price and how much ressources they have available, to support a system that might overtake the rotten system we have today. no matter the usd valuation of bitcoin.
if you only intersted in said valuation: it is worth getting into it now, if the price increases in the future.
since no one hear can see the future, we dont know.
@_date: 2019-10-05 21:11:37

@_date: 2019-10-14 11:36:26
watching the volume of only 1 exchange to come to a conclusion like this is, to put it mildly, naive.
global trading volum increases of more than 100% in just a few days are a normal thing (as well as declines to of the same magnitude).
welcome to the bitcoin space i guess, calm down, everything is okay, the world is not ending.
ps: the trade volume last year this time was only between a 1/3 to 1/10 of todays, depending on the exact day you look.

there are about 10 000 visible nodes (probably 10 times as much invisible ones) that decide if a change in the code will be implemented or not. miners do not play a role in a decision like that.
well, they do, but not that much. a miner is just one node, one voice amongst \~100 000 voices. one miner with 50 000 asics is still just one miner.

@_date: 2019-10-29 19:02:35
iam not sure adding more zeros is possible or desirable.

depending on where in the eu, you might want to have a look at the tenx card. with that you can sell your bitcoin at a almost perfect rate on any fiat atm around the world. in germany (and austria?) this should be possible within this year.

the only good analogy i ever hear is the comparison with gold and paper money.
paper money is to gold what lightning is to bitcoin.
instead of carrying the heavy gold from a to b to buy a condome, you use paper money (which was redeemable into gold until 1971). 
there are alot of good and short videos out there, explaining the ln network. iam not sure anyone with half baked knowledge here would be able to explain it better than this.
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:39:02
as much as i would love to believe that they kinda contradict themselves, dont they?
pays with bitcoin for the birth of his son
" *Imagine what it would take to sell that quantity in gold, for example.* "
" hat leaves mothers-to-be in serious financial trouble since decent clinics can cost upwards of $1,500. "
so yea, paying something worth 1500$ with gold isnt actually that hard to accomplish (you only need \~40g of gold or so).
but yea, for larger amounts this might become a problem, and there is the fake gold thing and the divisibility problem (what if you want to spend only 35g for example).
so yea, bitcoin &gt; gold.

@_date: 2019-10-29 12:59:48
i thought of this questions allready.
first question: no one, but \[copy and pasted from one of my earlier answers\]  you might accept that this is still not 100% perfect, but an huge improvement.
"unless you lower your fault tolerance? lets say some ppl will label this batches wrong or temper in what ever way with it. these kind of things allready are happening anyways. if you accept this and still implement the tracking of that kind, it might be an improvement to what ever is happening now? so, in general, when buying chocolate, you know when the cocoa beans where processed and what ways they took until you picket them up in the supermarket. and you want this on the blockchain rather than in a sql database, because the automated entries (sansors on the batch, the truck, the ship) are not alterable.
so, although it has flaws, it still be an improvement?"
second question: to secure the blockchain PoW might not be usefull here, indeed. but shouldnt a PoS model be possible to accomplish something like this? or even what ever neo is using, it does not need elecricity to secure the chain, but it still seems at least somewhat secure.

decrease or increase in price is an almost meaningless metric to use if one wants to estimate the meaningfulness of such an asset.
none of the other "currencies" are of any value.
i would say 90% of them are just created with a finger snap, only to increase the value of their creators. the other 10% i cant write off in one sentence, i would at least need 2, but iam to lazy for that right now.

@_date: 2019-10-22 09:27:07
even if miners are running behind the website, cloud mining is almost never profitable. in rare instances, where you hit the sweetspot (where their future prediction of the mining difficulty is so different from what actually happens, that the maintain fee's are so low that it is actually worth it and u get more btc out than u paid), it might be profitable. but you hitting those spots is very unlikely and just gambling.
i run the numbers, i tried it out. not worth it.
e: i dont have the exact numbers right now, but i spend like \~1.8btc on cloud mining contracts and got out \~1.5btc (and i was very lucky with that outcome). +- a bit on both numbers tho.
@_date: 2019-10-21 10:26:45

@_date: 2019-10-23 13:29:59

in a recession ppl might still accept your dollar, but they might not accept 5$ for a bread, they might want to have 50 000$ instead?
the dollar becomes less and less trusted around the world. iam into bitcoin because i trust it more than the euro and dollar. iam actually convinced that bitcoin will survive both of those currencies. bitcoin is my hedge against the current system. i would also buy gold, but only real gold and making sure i actually get real gold is a to big hassle for me.

the nature of rewards change in he future. you dont get block rewards for mining, but you get the reward of transaction fee. this will be, so the theory, high enough to incentivise enough miners to keep the nextwork secure.
maybe in 2100 the block reward will only be 0.00001 bitcoin (which is the combined transaction fee of every transactino in this block).
but this amount will be enough to buy a house?
market forces will regulate it.
@_date: 2019-10-23 11:32:03
no, i really should not. everyone who still wastes his ressources to throw out his prediction to the million other predictions of bitcoins price in the future really does not deserve my time.

the next uninformed "scientist" claim something they have no clue about, its such a pitty, really.
i wont talk about the article, thats well enough explained in the comments.
but lets talk about the economics. bitcoin energy consumtion is a little as possible. imagine any other asset with this kind of price development, lets say silver? what would have happend then? the amount of energy spend to mine silver would have grown in direct proportion to the price of it. why? because its possible. it is possible to increase the amount of mined silver/year significantly, the only reason this does not happen is because its not worth it.
and the only real world assest this kind of increase of output is not possible, is gold. because of its rarity.
guess what, the only other thing is kind of increase i not possible is bitcoin. not because of its rarity but because of its code.
thats why bitcoin, as hard money, is so valueable. it incentivises the least amount of ressources possible to be spend for its "creation".
if you compare that to our easy fiat money which can be generatet at almost zero cost endlessly, this incentivizes \~20% (if i remember correctly) of our society to take part in the generation of money. the same society run on hard money (gold or bitcoin), under 5% would be involved in the creation of money (which can be seens when looking at the numbers prior 1971).
conclusion: easy fiat money incentivises \~15% of our society to waste their brain power to create more easy money, whereas a bitcoin or gold driven society these 15% would be put to real productive use which in turn would increase the prosperity of the society as a whole.

block size has nothing to do with scale. it does not matter if you have 1mb, 16mb or 64mb block sizes, not for scale. you cant scale on the blockchain.
the only thing that an increase in the blocksize does is short term lowering of transactions fee's (well, not even that at the moment) and decreasing the security of the blockchain. why would u ever do that? it just makes no sense and i dont get why every now and then someone comes up with this argument.
yes i hate the price mems ppl as well, but i learned thats just how reddit it. live with it or dont use reddit. if you truely would investigate the tech, you would see that there is \_nothing\_ that is even close to bitcoin in terms of every important metric.
i investigated so many (shit)coins in this space, wrote my thesis about it and in my opinion, the only conclusion someone can objectively draw after such an investigation is that it makes no sense to bet on anything else than  bitcoin.
e: i was deep into altcoins in the beginning of my "career". all these nice promises "blockchain will solve supply chain, buy this coin", "blockchain will solve music industry, buy this coin" and than all the bitcoin 2.0, 3.0 etc waving around there transactions per second bullshit. its just such a cheap farce.
but it works, unfortunately. i fell for it, u still falling for it and lots of others, too. dunno what to do about it other than to write this kind of stuff over and over.

your feelings do not constitute facts, therefor i would suggest a more probable scenario. One in which the mainstream adoption of bitcoin was not stopped by what ever force, but rather your feeling was just wrong.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:35:42
allways when u start talking in manner like "they are all dumb" etc. because of a bad expierence you had, you can be almost certain that you are wrong. it is way to simplistic to put one characteristica across a whole group of ppl like that.
as i said, the main reason you had this bad experience is not because of the bitcoin subreddit, i think it is because of reddit in general. i had this sort of discussions at least 10 times in 10 different reddits (nutrition, tea, keto, trump, religion etc) and everytime u dont go with the dogma of the sub, you get downvoted.
thats is just what anonymity on a plattform like that does with humans. drawing the wrong conclusions because of that is foolish and i hope i could enlighten you a bit. your frustrated, understandably so. just dont get down to their level and stay rational.
i understand bitcoin very well, i think.
to have a more sophisticated discussion on the subject you have to either turn away from reddit or become the admin of a new subreddit, where only discussions are allowed that fullfill a certain qualitative criteria.
i think this sub is mostly filled with meme posters and ppl who just repeat what they heard in yt video xyz.

there are certain criteria a miner has to respect when putting transactions into a block. if a miner does respect those criteria, than there are no malicious  transactions in that block by definition. if the miner violates one of those criteria and is trying to propagate a block it gets blacklisted by every node receiving a block from said miner.

well, buying bitcoin is a risk in itself, technically speaking. you risk your money because bitcoin can go to zero.
if you buy futures you just increase the risk by adding one more station that can fail you. for example a global economy crysis may render the insitute u bought ur futures from unable to pay you if you choose to sell.

i wonder how you know that the most visited porn sites arent actually infected. acording to john mcafee they are, but not with your common average "virus".
for example, he is saying that, when you ever visited a porn site with your mobile phone, that this very phone can be rooted by government x if they so choose. this statement combined with the knowledge i gained in the last \~15years makes this highly believable to me.
well, at least more believable then someone say "no, thats not the case".
so, in my world someone has everything in place to steal all my bitcoin IF i visited a porn site with that device. and that someone might do so if the economy grumbles and bitcoin becomes the new standard.
because of that i do everything bitcoin in a secure way and have my mind at ease.
better one step to much than one to less.

thanks for the explanation. i still dont get it tho. not fully.
so you are saying these companies are selling bonds (asking for loans, right?). but so many ppl want to buy these bonds (give the company a loan) that the company actually can demand interest rates on such bonds? 
and ppl want do pay interest to those bonds (to the loan they gave to the company lol), because they think the company will do well and pay them back big time(coupon rate)?
thats what your explanation sounds like after comparing it to some things on  [

only by taking some risk u might get rich later. if your capital is not very high, the risk has to increase to achieve the same goal. putting all your eggs into the bitcoin basket constitute a high risk i would assume, u might lose it all, but u might change your life with this one in 10 generations opportunity.

i have a mobile wallet and there is only btc on it if i actually need them to be on there. but other than that, never put stuff on your phone (at least not huge amounts).
maybe your a millionaire and those 2.4 btc where just play money, than its oaky and you learned your lesson.
btw is the wallet still in use by the "hackers"?
if so, maybe you got the same private key as someone else, which generated the same public key which generated the same address, just by hyper chance. that would be bad karma

but if they had such a computer, cracking bitcoin would be one of the lower targets to go for. because with  such a machine you basically can crack any encription, everywhere. no such entity would give a shit about 100 billion moneys.

how old are you?
if you think you can get through this unscaved, sleep in your car for a while and take it as an adventure or something. this is a one in a lifetime opportunity to be part in a shift of wealth into never needing to accumulate money again anymore.
if that truely happens and you sold your btc now, that might haunt you for the rest of your days.
not an actualy advice, more like a "think about that before you do it" thing.
what ever you do, i hope you make a decision that lets you sleep well at night.
cheers and gl my man!
