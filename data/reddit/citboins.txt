Creating change currently costs the same as cleaning it up. If you make cleaning it up cost less than creating it people will be more likely to clean it up then keep it sitting around, bloating the UTXO.
The discount is not as oft claimed a "change in economics" of the system. In fact the system itself exists on the assumption that selfish economic behavior is aligned with healthy operation of the network. Any change to the protocol which maintains/improves this base assumption is in line with the economic assumptions of the system.
But either way it's up to the miners, always has been.

This still does not capture the spirit of what occurred. BCH never needed to implement the changes, that is the beauty of soft forks. Them hard forking had nothing ultimately to do with segwit in the technical sense. They decided to change a consensus rule orthogonally to segwit.

This is a common misconception, as unconfirmed transactions are "dead" by nature. They are only brought to life--to use your analogy--until they are inserted in a block. 
Based on current behavior in Bitcoin Core, the likelihood of a double spend succeeding is directly related to which transaction the network sees first. If both transactions are submitted at the same time, the probability of a coin toss landing on heads is roughly equivalent to the likelihood a double spend will be successful. [0] Unfortunately the solution provided by that paper opens up DoS attacks on the network, so we maintain the current behavior. 
That is obviously a non-negligible probability. In no way does Opt-in RBF shift this narrative. Would you feel comfortable telling a merchant that unconfirmed transactions are safe after knowing the facts? 
Opt-in RBF not only maintains the status quo, but it adds much needed functionality. There needs to be a clear path to alleviate uncertainty for unskilled Bitcoin users who might make a mistake when broadcasting their transaction. A short window to access an "undo" button could make or break millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. And no, FSS is not acceptable in this instance, as it jeopardizes the privacy of the user (and thus the entire network) by exposing the change output.

It has yet to be proven that blocks &gt;8MB will not significantly raise orphan rates for miners outside of the GFW. If orphan rates increase, miners will be forced to move their mining operations to China. Even your own beloved jtoomim says he can no longer support BIP 101 until this is explored further. [0]
What baffles me about the XT community is how little information it takes to sway you. Hearn and co wrote a couple blog posts and everyone jumped ship. No legit testing to back up the claims. Gavin's original testing was proven to be incomplete (RE 20MB blocks being acceptable, propagation delays exceed 8 secs). 
You are obviously entitled to your beliefs, but in this case your beliefs are seated on an unproven hypothesis.

Mike Hearn throws around accusations without any merit. His vilification of Blockstream couldn't be further from the truth.
Bitcoin Classic is using concerning tactics to overtake Core. jtoomim is willing to have consensus threshold be as low as 60% for hard fork. This could lead to dangerous forking situations. They are heavy on the 'community' involvement in development but I am not yet convinced that jtoomim doesn't just have the final say on most things. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 23:09:05
Oh I see now, nodecounter must be filtering the Choopa IPv6 prefix as well. Although I do believe given enough strain on Choopas network they would choose to shut down the nodes. 


I mean host as in *privately owned* network that provides hosting solutions. Certainly there could be a single node with many public facing IPs running behind Choopa, but I am not making that claim right now. 
Either way I don't think you can really make the argument that this situation is an anti-DDoS boon when 50% of Classic nodes exist at the courtesy of those two network providers. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:27:47
Namecoin stopped being merge mined because the software constantly crashed and caused loss of profits for miners. However, if a sidechain introduces profits for a miner and has stable software, incentive compatability seems perfectly lined up.
@_date: 2016-03-05 06:08:14


That is the exact scenario I'm concerned with.


I don't think you'll find that I said that. In fact I am much less concerned with block generation times than I am with validation times, to which you mention:


And I agree, if we have segwit this is less of a problem. My post was predicated on Classic coming before segwit, should have made that more clear. 
But I do believe miners are incentivized to build expensive blocks even if it costs them extra time to make them, so long as the time it takes to generate the solution is less than the amount of time it takes to validate the block it is a net win if they are attempting to pursue this behavior. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 04:40:47


nerp derp, read what I said. They should have tried double spending it by submitting the transaction directly to a miner out of band (many are known to help folks with stuck transactions) or creating another transaction with a very high fee that used the unconfirmed output. Miners don't uses CPFP but they might have seen that high fee transaction and made an exception. 
And unless you have proof a miner was involved in that bet and would have benefited from this event (beyond being paid a fee by a non-miner to mine the transaction out of band) then you are pulling at straws.

RBF is node policy, not a consensus rule. Core (jtimon) is working on building libbitcoinconsensus so people can set node policy however they like with alternative implementations. It is in the spirit of Bitcoin for Core (just like any implementation) to build in node policy functionality that they want to enable. They do however decree controversial attempts to change consensus code. That is not something they participate in.

I did confuse a few things there, thanks for pointing that out. Looking back that comment made no sense. 
Bytes hashed is not a bad solution, it's just wrapped in a hard fork which has its own set of hurdles. When you are willing to ignore the concerns of a quickly rolled out hard fork, apples to apples it protects the network better from hard-to-validate blocks that soft fork segwit. Segwit obviously has a lot of great benefits which should also be taken into consideration. And although miners can create hard-to-validate blocks with non-segwit transactions, network participants can upgrade at their leisure or not at all. I also think when the Core HF rolls around we will see a viable long term solution implemented.
As for knapsack, your solution as you said only works until 11MB and then you have to modify IsStandard to keep the dimensions 'in check'.  What do you propose to change exactly?
@_date: 2016-03-26 20:43:56
They have shifted from a risk-free-loan scam to an alt coin crowdsale scam. Color me surprised.
@_date: 2016-03-05 00:03:09
The extra dimension to the knapsack problem seems like a serious step backward. As block sizes increase this geometric increase in validation time allows for blocks that take hours to validate. This could be used as a tool by larger miners to squeeze smaller miners out of the network. 
Even if miners have not yet exploited this attack vector, the upcoming halving eats into profits and miners might be incentivized to produce these hard-to-validate blocks to disadvantage other miners. Even a nominal block size increase makes this attack more viscious. It seems irresponsible to just hand wave away these concerns. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:03:34
Skim the post, it's all right there :)
@_date: 2016-03-24 22:29:30
Your core premise is sound: the more nodes (VPS or otherwise) the larger the surface area that the DDoS attacker must touch to take down the their targets. But in reality when you have 600 or 700 nodes in a single host and that host is attacked, they will just shut all the nodes  down at once. On March 16th there was a huge drop in Classic nodes (1000), I don't know the story but I assume someone pointed a DDoS attack their way and they got dropped from the provider. 
When the nodes are unsophisticated sybils you cannot really rely on them in any meaningful capacity. In light of that, your arguments make it sound like you are an apologist for sybil attacks on the network.

Absolute clown show. Wrote up a veerrry long post dissecting his bullshit: 
@_date: 2016-03-02 08:32:52
The wallet manager for BitBet screwed up 3 times. Twice with low fee txs and then a third time (biggest mistake) was broadcasting transaction B with DIFFERENT inputs paying the same people without waiting for the other transaction to confirm or attempting to double spend it themselves. It appears likely that the recipients of the original payout held onto a copy of the transaction and later rebroadcast when they saw the opportunity for a double payout. 
The article says:


This is not contrary to expectation because it is a double spend and Core (and Classic) do not currently relay double spends for fear of this behavior being exploited as a vector for DoS. A1 would not have been relayed by Core but A2 may have depending on local policy. A1 may have been relayed by Classic based on priority. So unless they waited for the A1/A2 to confirm they would have had to submit A3 directly to miners and hope they would confirm it. The conspiracies they spew about the Relay Network are thus unsubstantiated. How are you going to "nuke" a transaction out of my mempool?


We have no way of knowing which nodes they were polling and considering the mistakes made in the broadcasting of transactions it seems possible that they were only checking block explorers which are running Core. 
KnC mined the block with A1 and they run Classic which still has priority space. Someone can run the numbers and see if the transaction qualified for the priority space at the time. It may have been relayed to KnC days earlier by Classic nodes and sat around until it was "its turn." The timing here seems a bit too perfect so it very well could have been sent to KnC directly (out of band from the rest of the network) by one of the bettors who paid to include it. This is profit maximizing behavior and KnC may not have been "in" on it. BitBet effectively left money laying on the street and they are trying to blame everyone but themselves. 
Their post in no way confirms a cartel acting maliciously for some measly bitbet payouts. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:36:45
Theymos played his part, but Blockstream and the core dev team could have done more to voice discontent with the behavior. He is not the only one to blame. The complacency of the core devs when it came to PR is the main issue in my eyes. They did not advocate for themselves properly and this led to a complete disconnect. Hearn was free to say whatever he wanted about Blockstream and the core devs and there was no one there to defend them. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:52:21
Good post, although fails to touch on a lot of the more explicitly malicious behavior of Hearn and co. that I flush out in more detail here: 
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:29:53
This is exactly right. In fact the original BitReserve was much like Neo&amp;Bee in structure. When BitReserve started out there was only Bitcoin deposits and withdrawls. You would deposit Bitcoin and they would hold a dollar balance for you. 
But if Bitcoin ever went to 0 they would not have any way to give you back your money. So you were just paying them to short Bitcoin in effect. Halsey's comments as you say reflect that. Now that they know Bitcoin can't be stopped so easily he has had to shift his scam tactics to crowdsales. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 09:15:27
Perhaps I can state it differently to get the point across. Core must follow the "bitcoin social contract" for rules of consensus. If a group does not maintain the same rules of consensus or agree to some change to the rules with broad community support, then the social contract is broken and users are disinfranchised.
Node policy is not part of the social contract because there is no way to enforce how a node operates and it does not effect the state of the blockchain or the block validation rules, it is completely up to the individual running it. That is one of the beautiful things about Bitcoin, you can run your node how YOU want so long as you are following the CONSENSUS rules. Trying to tell Core how to determine the node policies they make available in their software is akin to centralization.

They updated the BIP a long time ago to address your concern. The only reason that appeared to be a vulnerability is because they underspecified the BIP itself. It is impossible for a second (or third etc...) contract to be associated with the address when the derivation scheme is multiparty. The BIP is just an implementation of the pay-to-contract protocol outlined by Hanke which requires a merchant and customer. The customer and merchant both derive the address from the merchant's payment base and the contract itself, there is nowhere to sneak another contract in. The customer would never send funds to an address that includes contract they did not agree to.

How exactly would someone be able to include a second contract in the address derivation when the contract is hashed on the client side and combined with the payment base? Unless you are saying the payment base itself will be derived from another contract, which is fine, the protocol states clearly that the contract itself is separate from the base, so any games played there would not hold up in a dispute.
