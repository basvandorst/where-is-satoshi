i think stupid people will figure out how to use bitcoin if they need too. Ive seen some dumb as a fuckin rock, like 85 IQ, druggies bitcoining like crazy during the silk road days. Im talking probably clinically retarded people using it successfully even though they didn't understand why the price went up and down and would get mad at me when it would go down after i sold them btc.
I think bitcoin being concentrated in the hands of a few people now is irrelevant because it still works just the same as money as if it were divided more equally.
Most of the problems are the exchanges getting hacked. Which isn't a problem with bitcoin. You can buy bitcoin from people in most cities and i never hear of small sellers getting hacked. Maybe large institutions are incapable of handling bitcoin but small 1 person or few people size exchangers that take bank deposits and send you coins are doing well on local bitcoin and mycelium.
the subsystems (exchanges) are bullshit so those need improvement but that isn't a problem with bitcoin. Eventually we will get that functionality probably more decentralized.

I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.
“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”
“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”
“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”
The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”
“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”
“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”
He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”
“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”
I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.
“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.
“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.
“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”
It didn’t seem like they did.
“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”
Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.
I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.
“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.
Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.
“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.
I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”
He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.
“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”
“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.
“Because I was afraid.”
“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”
I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.
“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”
He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.

The rebuttal is that crypto with advanced capabilities has only really been in the works for 3 years and we are just now getting to the point where people can code advanced features.
I liked a lot of the contrarian arguments in that piece but they are mostly coming from him seeing what crypto is/was and assuming it will always be so primitive in the future.
There are tons of things happening now. open bazaar, bisq, decentralized exchanges, atomic swaps, digital governance stuff that aragon is working on, 2nd+3rd layers, VR metaverse like decentraland, ICOs for funding businesses.
Just all sorts of shit that is really only a year in development.

Here is a scenario, The great recession II begins next year, his mortgage payment is way higher than it was previously. He loses his job in the recession. He needs to sell bitcoin to cover his mortgage but he has to sell into everyone else selling to try to stay afloat since the the tech crash exposed so much unprofitable unicorns in the tech sector and all those weekly buyers fizzled out when they lost their investor and government subsidized jobs whose existence was merely a symptom of massive market distortions caused by centralbanks.gov policies 
He spends down all his BTC but the recession fizzles on just long enough to have his house repossessed by the banksters. The economy starts to turn around and bitcoin and housing moon again with QE90X. Warren Buffet bought it all up you house your bitcoin and all the banking stock once he had secured guarantees from the fed to reflate the bubble.

I get that but it seems like even with electricity always at 1 cent per KW and infinite in supply the subsidy of bitcoin dropping along with money paid to miners in the form of transaction fees dropping because majority of transactions move to second layers there will be less pay for miners and thus they would still have to shut off hashrate that was unprofitable.

Here is some anti-authoritarian logic for brainwashed minarchists and AmericanLibertarians^TM
The government has some small amount accountability to the electorate. 
A Corporations internal hierarchical structure is akin to oligarchical collectivist dictatorship with no accountability whatsoever to those not in the nobility and with no ability to recall the masters.
A ministate or an AmericanLibertarian^TM state that maintains state level military/police that does the bidding of the unaccountable authoritarian hierarchies that are corporations is just tyranny, IT IS NOT FREEDOM, It Is WAAAAAY worse than having a government that actually provides services like universal healthcare and welfare and consumer protection and environmental protection. 
The first part of the state that has to be destroyed, to make it so that we can destroy the corporations that pollute and fuck us all over, is the violent arm of the state, the police and military. Otherwise we get pure corporate authoritarianism.
The kochtopus tries to push this AmericanLibertarians^TM that is simply a rebranded Neoreactionary Aristocracy
This is why people hate AmericanLibertarians^TM because they are mostly Fascists with fresh rhetoric passing off Extreme Authoritarianism as "liberty". 


so in conclusion fuck you tyrant, the government should have NO role if it involves police or military. If they stop protecting the corporations we could shut them down. Nobody would have to drink poison in the rivers or breathe Koch refinery air because we could destroy them or make it so costly the become untenable, then we could build a society that isn't fucked up.

Everyone be warned, be prepared to read 2k pages of tax law and 2k pages of nonprofit law if you want to pukl this off and remain compliant. Unless you are cashing out near the $1million mark or above, over the long run trying to avoid the taxes through 501c3 will cost you more than it will save.

If you can't understand this you have problems no one can help you with. 
Bitcoin isn't just a technical protocol it is also an economic one. The economic side is broken.
Nobody who is a BTC hodler wants to leave for alts but people who actually use crypto for business have no choice, it isn't ideology it is just math. It isn't economically rational to buy a $5 comic book or even an ounce of weed if you have to pay $35...$15.. or even $5 in fees when you can use any other crypto that has less fees to provide the same utility.

When you sell for long-term capital gains rate you just tell them your cost basis, if you cannot prove your cost basis set it to zero, if they can prove you are lying you are still fucked, for example if there is data of you buying the bitcoin 9 months ago then selling it. 
The block chain doesn't tell them too much because you could just have moved things between your own addresses.

Gold has thousands of years of history of being a wealth preserver when currencies are destroyed, bitcoin has a 10 year history of being a somewhat useful value exchange mechanism with an eye on being gold 2.0, but bitcoin requires people to make it into a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
As long as sufficient people continue to buy and hodl and flush out the weak hands y'all can bootstrap it into the new currency/gold2.0 system. 
You will still have to pass through the gauntlet of real pushback from the powers that be.

Thats why states continue occupying and oppressing. abolishing beneficial state functions while leaving state enforcement of corporate interests is worse than having a government that actually does useful things like promote welfare of citizens.
When most "libertarians" want to fight big government they only want to get rid of the part of government that helps the bottom 80% of the population, not the part that maintains the bottom 80's dispossession. 
The anarchists people's militia of the spanish civil war did a damn good job simultaneously fighting the commies the fascists and the capitalist all at the same time, so it is possible to protect without the state.

Monero works better than bitcoin and has better privacy right now which is an enhancement on censorship resistance. Bitcoin is losing market share and will continue to until the costs of use drop substantially. Ultimately it will lose its first movers advantage because there is no reason to migrate back to bitcoin once you've sold out into functional money.
satoshi invented peer to peer digital currency. I dont care if that is peer to peer through the lightning network or through some other thing like blocksize increases and sharding but if you think bitcoin isnt to be used at a grocery store then im curious what the hell you even think bitcoin is for.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:46:03
nobody will answer you here because they don't know, they just came for the get rich quick meme scheme.
Lightning will help if opening and closing a channel is something you do rarely and then do all your transactions on lightning. This will remove some fee pressure from the blockchain so opening and closing will get cheaper or at least compete with how much people are willing to pay for on block transactions. so think about lightning as 2X the cost of a normal transaction. so it would be economically rational to open and close a channel as long as you do 3+ transactions on lightning. 
but wait that only assumed bitcoin in isolation. Bitcoin is also in competition with traditional payments and other cryptocurrencies like bcash and monero which currently offer transactions for a tiny fraction of the cost of  what using lightning by opening and closing a channel would be.
It is complicated. Nobody knows how it will play out in the long term but bitcoin is useless as a currency now for any normal uses. Every non-fanatical non-ideological person i know is exiting bitcoin into eth, monero, and apparently bcash by the looks of the charts. Bitcoin devs seem to believe it is invincible and they are willing to drive it into the ground by not throwing us the bone of even a 2MB blocksize until further optimizations like schnorr and lightning.

Have they ever had you on an antibiotic called SMZ/TMP? something like that i dont know all the name brand names for it. that shit exacerbates it.
You could have undiagnosed nutcracker syndrome, which sounds like something i just made up but it is real, a problem where the vein/artery flowing to your testicle passes through a place where it is slightly pinched way higher up like in your kidney, this causes pressure build up in your testicle because the bloodflow goes through your balls and has to exit but the exit in your kidney is narrow so you have chronic high pressure in your nut.
It is genetic and many people inherit it from their mother but often women feel no symptoms or maybe it just manifests as some occasional kidney/back pain for them. so that is one thing to look into because they can surgically open that space with a shunt and you will feel better pretty much instantly.
In my case i had something similar to that but induced by inflammation from antibiotics and fucked up guts, they had me on antibiotics because i had that testicular pain but the pain started from being on SMZ/TMP in the first place from when a brown recluse spider bit me on the face, then they kept prescribing me that shit for over a year because my nut hurt and i was super fucked up from it. Then one day i was going to kill myself because my life was pure misery from it so i just stopped taking all the pills and started using herbal medicine for prostate and "mens health" and eating Kim Chi and all sorts of high dose probiotic stuff. and stayed away from inflammatory foods but you have to find out which foods fuck you up specifically. The pain diminished but was still bad enough that i just didnt want to do anything that involved moving around until one day i ate an overdose of cannabis brownies and hallucinated while puking and shitting violently then went and passed out on the floor. The next day i felt almost completely better after over a year of torture. 
TLDR overdosed on weed, anti-inflammatory effect plus clearing intestines made space that allowed proper blood flow to exit testicle.
also avoid dairy and lots of factory farmed red meat

Nobody knows but in a liquidity crunch and recession people will be selling btc to cover housing and needs costs when they are laid off, they will be selling into very few buyers. This will crash the price.

The problem is that bitcoin needs buyers and if everyone is selling it to cover living expenses while others are broke from the recession to the point of not being buyers you will see the price drop to major lows. Liquidity in the rest of the market will effect bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-08-17 23:57:33
A liquidity crunch will absolutely pummel bitcoins price into the ground. It will still not die and will be good for using to transfer money as it has been.
When people panic they dump the most speculative investments. There will be tons of people selling to cover mortgages and other life expenses when they lose their jobs, they will be selling into a market with few buyers. We will go back to late silk road era prices.
If fiat currencies and gov debt bubbles start to pop and bailouts start happening bitcoin will go into a bull market from those lows.

Peak oil hit in 2006 and then fracking got us a new pool and this current boom but if you look at the depletion rate in fracked fields it does not look very good, combine that with practically zero CAPEX for the past few years and you have yourself an oil crisis on the horizon. 
What are the miracle technologies that are going to save us this time? Tar sand have a terrible EROEI, maybe LNG can take the place of gasoline and other liquid fuels for a while. Other than that and a few untapped fracking plays in south america and saudi arabia everyone just guessed peak oil one economic cycle too early.

Like bitcoin sounded ridiculous to anyone that wasn't a cypherpunk for the first few years.
This is the early early phase of what will be nearly as important as bitcoin.
A decentralized Metaverse is the holy grail of the internet and was previously impossible.
There is a huge graveyard of failed attempts at creating a viable metaverse.
A combination of new technologies has become available that make what was previously impossible, now feasible, things like IPFS, Blockchains, cryptocurrency, along with sufficenty powerful affordable computers and other hardware. 
This is the moment in time when nobody believes it, but a small group who has watching the space for decades much like when people like hal finney were still watching the space for a cryptocurrency and saw when satoshi finally cracked the code by assembling the right components with some new innovations. 
People have been trying to crack the Metaverse problem for decades and now the puzzle pieces are coming together.
this is it. this is profound. 
There isn't much i can do to make people who haven't been paying attention to this space multiple decades understand, just like it was hard to make people who weren't cypherpunks understand why bitcoin was revolutionary.

china has the cash reserves and positive balance sheet to actually pay down bad debts without any type of QE or other bullshit. will that effect the economy negatively,YES. It will pale in comparison to the shitstorm that will happen in the next USA crash. If the china thing rattles the western markets enough it could just be the catalyst to knock over the first domino in the cascading systems failure in all the highly leveraged western economies. China will still have a solid economy that will just funtion like a normal economy instead of a 10% a year growth economy while the westerns go negative. so i think i agree with you i just think china 's problems can be contained to within china. I would bet my money it contains its problems, not on cascading systems failure. ramble... ramble...

best thing to do is practice with fake trades and see if you can make money. then  you buy low sell high. or short high and cover low. dont execute trades that make you lose money just sit them out. avoid leverage unless you have huge risk appetite. with this plan you can only lose if you get caught in a position where bitcoin never goes again

I actually did that and was arrested. Then i did it on someones private property with permission and it was illegal to build shelter without permits and the shelter i wanted to live in was against the law because it was "too small". Then i was arrested for using water out of the stream to water my garden and later arrested for fishing. They told me to collect rainwater from my roof but i couldnt because it was illegal to build a house i could afford. Then later it turned out to be illegal to harvest rainwater but it wasnt under the jurisdiction of the agency that told me to collect it in the first place. I couldn't get permits because i didnt have a "legal" address.

The "bitcoin aristocracy" this guy refers to are not the same as the current bailout taking, bankster elites.
When someone has a lot of bitcoin and spends them they no longer have them and the only way to get more is to do something someone is willing to pay for. 
The so-called "bitcoin aristocracy" cannot just maintain their wealth and privilege printing bitcoin and getting bailouts.
If they don't spend their bitcoin and just "hoard" it that is great because it just makes everyone else bitcoin more valuable by keeping supply off the market. 
If they aren't spending it they are not materially better off than non-elites. 
If they are spending it then the wealth is being distributed and making its way through the economy to people providing goods and services.


Ok the above does not make sense unless you don't know btc is dividable to 8 decimal places. If anything the more valuable and the more users and more velocity the more it will be a stable currency.


There is no such thing as over-accumulation of capital. That is called saving and it is necessary to start a business or purchase things that cost more than you currently have.
If you hold more than you will need to make purchases all you are doing is driving up the value of all participants bitcoin. 


There are many forms of libertarianism that are for free markets but not propertarianism, so that is a false statement.


Is the distribution of bitcoin becoming more or less concentrated? they didn't bother attempt to even demonstrate the claim they make.

I get the principal, but in this particular case of a car exploding and burning the drivers to death it makes sense to give them the option to consent to the risk or pay $13.
There is meaningful difference between a rubber cap on a screw and exploding upon impact. The example of side airbags illustrates my point, i purposely choose a car with side airbags and would pay extra if the upgrade is an option.
Any reasonable person would rather pay $13 than risk getting blown up and burned to death in an event that has a realistic probability of occurring.

yeah i don't regret it either. 
When i tried to set it up i don't think i ever had it set up right anyways, it was a pain in the ass. I think i had tried to do it through some really convoluted path like windows emulators on puppy linux or something. I am not computer savvy enough to figure it out and i was just going off of vague hints of how other people solved the problems i was having. The only thing that makes me think i even had it working was that my computer fan turned on high mode and didn't shut off for a long time when i finally thought i had it running.
I watch the local bitcoins volume charts in countries experiencing financial and political chaos like VZLA chile argentina hongkong turkey etc... 
It appears bitcoin is fulfilling it's purpose as a non-government non-bankster currency quite well . (ignoring btc's privacy flaws)
So i have higher and higher confidence that it may be an effective hedge from a mainstream economics perspective. Other than maybe  a mass unemployment and/or debt shock event drying up buyer liquidity faster than banks/gov can QE /helicopter money.
 you have any thoughts about cryptocurrency in the energy descent scenarios? any wild speculation
Clearly if the whole world system goes full rapid catabolic, crypto will be pointless as anything that isn't biophysical.
But it seems like there is chance for lots of in between slower descent scenarios when a steady-state currency makes more sense than the alternatives and the POW system is dynamically adjusting so energy quantity itself doesn't matter that much in regard to functionality so long as it remains above the threshold where someone could turn on lots of shutdown miners and 51% attack.  
haha, I am probably just looking for someone to convince me to sell it for real productive assets in the next crypto bubble (if we get one) before the shit hits the fan.

Inflation and deflation are properties of a relationship between money supply and goods.
if the supply of money is decreasing but the supply of goods decreasing faster you will see inflation, even though the total supply of money is decreasing.
if the supply of money is increasing and the total goods is increasing even faster you will see deflation.
people forget this because these scenarios are less common.

A futuristic technology experiment appears to have fallen prey to a common technological risk, as operators of a new investment fund based on a digital currency said they had suffered a catastrophic hack.

Founders of the fund, DAO, which was built around a digital currency called Ethereum and which raised more than $150 million this spring, said Friday morning they have been forced to shut down the fund and plan for its unwinding.
The attack spirited away roughly 3.6 million Ethereum coins, valued at around $55 million, from DAO to another account.
The Ethereum Foundation said on its website that the hacker’s account was identified and effectively frozen.
The attacker appeared to have exploited a loophole that essentially allowed a DAO stakeholder to create an identical fund and move money into it. But the code also imposes a waiting period that means the new fund can’t move any money for 27 days. The DAO’s founders are planning to “fork” the code and effectively void the hacker’s transactions.
“The DAO’s journey is over but all funds are safe,” said Stephan Tual, the founder of Slock.It, the group that created DAO, which stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. “All stolen funds will be retrieved from the attacker.”
The attack occurred in the early-morning hours on Friday and quickly sank the price of the Ethereum currency, which had been trading around $21 before it started. Within an hour, it had dropped 38% to $13. Late Friday, it was trading at $15.03. The value of the “tokens” that function like shares in the DAO fund fell as well.
The hack didn’t target the Ethereum network.
“DAO token holders and Ethereum users should sit tight and remain calm,” Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, wrote on the Ethereum Foundation’s blog. “Exchanges should feel safe in resuming trading.”
Still, it is a black eye for the industry. DAO was set up in May as an experiment in using digital currencies and self-operating digital contracts to create a venture-capital fund that could run itself. But it was criticized early on for being poorly constructed, and there were calls for it to halt operations while it worked out its bugs. Those criticisms now appear prescient.

Investors seemed less concerned with the hack than with DAO’s decision to erase the fraudulent transactions. The move would be welcomed by most ordinary investors. But in the anarchic world of digital currencies, that sort of top-down reordering of events—even fraudulent ones—violates the decentralized ethos investors thought that they were supporting.
One investor in the DAO, Menno Pietersen, said he opposed the rescue and called the incident a “horrible mess.” The DAO’s creators “messed up” and didn’t take the time to build their product correctly, he said. He acknowledged that he himself didn’t vet the investment carefully enough, but said that as a backer of Ethereum, he was against any fix that would invalidate the goal of creating a decentralized platform. If trades can simply be erased, he asked, “what will they do next?”
“It was a risky investment,” he said. “You shouldn’t complain if you got burned.”
Another investor, Collin LaHay, called the idea of forking a “scary precedent.”
DAO’s funds were slated to be spent on supporting Ethereum-based startups through a proposal-and-voting mechanism. Startups would request funding, DAO stakeholders would vote on it, and if the proposal was approved, funds would automatically be dispersed.
The startup began a crowdfunding drive in May. Investors put in Ethereum and got tradable DAO tokens in return, which conferred voting rights. DAO raised more than $150 million of Ethereum through the month, far more than its creators expected. That made it the top crowdfunding effort on record and brought a high degree of attention in the cryptocurrency world and even from mainstream media.
“It’s not a disaster,” Slock.It founder Mr. Tual said. “There will be more projects. These are still early days.”
The identity of the attacker isn’t known, but Mr. Tual thinks the person or persons may eventually be identified.
The universe of Ethereum developers is very small, he noted. “I probably know him.”

The "bitcoin aristocracy" this guy refers to are not the same as the current bailout taking, bankster elites.
When someone has a lot of bitcoin and spends them they no longer have them and the only way to get more is to do something someone is willing to pay for. 
The so-called "bitcoin aristocracy" cannot just maintain their wealth and privilege printing bitcoin and getting bailouts.
If they don't spend their bitcoin and just "hoard" it that is great because it just makes everyone else bitcoin more valuable by keeping supply off the market. 
If they aren't spending it they are not materially better off than non-elites. 
If they are spending it then the wealth is being distributed and making its way through the economy to people providing goods and services.


Ok the above does not make sense unless you don't know btc is dividable to 8 decimal places. If anything the more valuable and the more users and more velocity the more it will be a stable currency.


There is no such thing as over-accumulation of capital. That is called saving and it is necessary to start a business or purchase things that cost more than you currently have.
If you hold more than you will need to make purchases all you are doing is driving up the value of all participants bitcoin. 


There are many forms of libertarianism that are for free markets but not propertarianism, so that is a false statement.


Is the distribution of bitcoin becoming more or less concentrated? they didn't bother attempt to even demonstrate the claim they make.

I have a proprietary methodology that i will describe briefly but you should be able to figure out a rough approximation.
I take all the writings available on the internet from all the devs on each project i am looking at, this includes everything even twitter. ( dev lists compiled from GitHub commits to each different cryptocurrency). I then run the writings through a computer program that gives me an IQ equivalent for each person based on analyzing their writing, then i add these scores together with a weighting per person based on their total productivity (which is another data point i generate myself using a proprietary methodology).
There are quite a few tweeks and minor additional data i use but that is the general system.
Hint: all the data and tools are available free on the internet you just have to do the work yourself. I will sell you my data sets for a handsome sum.

Fuck goodwill and fuck USA for not having medical care available because of bullshit insurance company lobbyist fucks.
and also fuck all the people in this sub that hate people just because they are poor and think they should die.

The only thing that makes me think it may be sooner than we expect is that bitcoin sales spike in places like argetina vzla turkey etc... anytime currency issues or gov crackdown on capital happen. People are already using it as a hedge, only a small fraction of tech people but there is already a trend. Who knows how it would work in a global recession though.

Volatility against what? The price of goods. When btc adoption is ubiquitous and the total value is high there is nothing to push the volatility far in either direction. There is nothing about bitcoin that prevents its volatility from being similar to national currencies.  


I have started businesses without ever borrowing money, by saving. I have also loaned BTC for busnesses to use and recieved back less dollar value than i would have if i had just hodl the btc but that was a risk i was willing to take, because i still made positive returns in dollar amounts and getting positive return is all that is required, oppurtunity-cost of unknown hodl-gainz is discounted. Even if btc went to zero i had option to take returns in $cash and the cash value to cash value returns were positive.
 People will invest btc in real assets and productive assets, indeed they already are. I have bought over $10k worth of capital equipment because having equipment for an income generating business makes sense rather than just sitting on currency speculating. I know people who have bought and sold real estate for btc. 
The thing is your arguments are just based on garbage pseudo-science of orthodox economics.  In the real world the btc economy is functioning better every day. 


They are both happening and they will reach an equilibrium, even if someone has to make a side chain stable coins like DAI using bitcoin sidechains that are stabilized to some basket of goods as the arbitrary price target instead of dollars. 


yes there is . there is a point when the people left to adopt bitcoin is negligible. the adoption S-curve will saturate. 
The fixed supply will make it slightly deflationary in a growing economy which may throttle the economy until it reaches an undulating equilibrium. As long as population stabilizes and then declines that will allow steady state or degrowth. If population increases continually then bitcoin full adoption may actually throttle growth and overpopulation will decrease standard of living. 
Bitcoin price increasing doesn't stop it from being used as a currency. 
And all of this doesn't matter anyways because bitcoiners are not trying to stop people from using whatever currency they want so it just sounds like people like you are mad that working class people can escape the punishment of inflation by the central banks. 
Are you a central bankster elite rent-seeking piece of shit angry you are being disrupted? Do you think we should enforce the theft of inflation through state violence?

- high volatility (no stability for companies and consumers, no trade possible)
volatility is only high until we reach the saturation point on the S-curve of adoption. Volatility has been narrowing over time
- businesses not being able to borrow money due to increasing prices (you borrow now, you pay back twice the amount next year, impossible to do business)
Businesses borrowing is dragging the growth of the future into today, this is a huge problem for the environment and bitcoin needs to save the environment and encourage slow and steady capital formation through saving. 
- price increase would lead to implosion of exports due to rising value
Not when everyone is using the same currency. It is neutral.
- way less spending. People speculation on price increase instead of spending. Businesses sell less, hiring less and less people. &gt; Very high unemployment rates. 
Society should move towards stable-state or degrowth economies to save our species from environmental apocalypse. If we learn to organize our society in a rational way we will divvy up employment and create a basic income so people can live low impact lifestyles. Uncontrolled Growth is Cancer

Practically everything is in position for a full recession and bear market in the global economy. USA is just taking its sweet time. Trump is trying to keep the fed easing to pump before the election. If he keeps the economy hot and the democrats choose another neoliberal monster as their candidate trump will win again.
If the economy crashes out soon enough and dems choose  a moderate like yang or bernie they will win.
If all the weekly buyers in the tech world start getting laid off they will stop buying BTC at a time when many will be selling to keep up with their mortgages, this will crash btc price. There are so many overpaid techbros who work for ZombieUnicorns that have never made a dime of profit and exist on subsidies from the government and investors, even fracking companies. They will all be wiped out and silicon valley/bay area will be hurting. Meanwhile tons of companies overleveraged themselves to buy their own overpriced stock, they will go bankrupt or take a decade to recover to profitability, this will extend the recession into a depression.
The Positive possibility for bitcoin comes if enough people see it as a safe haven play and make it a self fulfilling prophecy , then it can rapidly  attract stunning amounts of money as everyone scrambles for the exits from the feds stock/bond/real estate/everything bubble economy. 
It can go either way for bitcoin.
What do you think
Will weekly buyers stop and reverse when they lose their jobs in the recession ? Will the giant blocks of institutional and elite money slushing around looking for safety see something in bitcoin and use it as a new kind of safe haven in the hyper-manipulated economy?

Paupericide is based on a clearly defined and widely accepted yet often unarticulated hierarchy. 
Violence done by those higher on the hierarchy to those lower is nearly always invisible, that is, unnoticed. 
When it is noticed, it is fully rationalized. 
Violence done by those lower on the hierarchy to those higher is unthinkable, and when it does occur is regarded with shock, horror, and the fetishization of the victims.
The property of those higher on the hierarchy is more valuable than the lives of those below.
 It is acceptable for those above to increase the amount of property they control—in everyday language, to make money—by destroying or taking the lives of those below.
 If those below damage the property of those above, those above may kill or otherwise destroy the lives of those below

It sux for people that were actually using bitcoin in their businesses though. I was using it to buy business supplies but now that becomes nonviable during these high fee times. Right now i can wait on confirmations to get in for a whole 24 hours and it doesnt bother me so i can currently use bitcoin again but this is really driving economic usage away from bitcoin. Dont get me wrong im glad people keep buying it and not using it as a currency because it means the btc i have saved retain value but over the long term i have trouble believing there wont be some sort of flippening if scaling doesnt happen soon enough.

It is very speculative that miners would automatically sell B2X when they are are trying to achieve a flippening.
People will be inadvertently accepting B2X for things because there is no replay protection and bitcoin will be practically frozen from the hashing power leaving for the B2X chain.
It is also speculative to use the figures of 20k versus 90k when it isnt the 16th yet

as bitcoins market cap and adoption grows the volatility declines, a few whales can make a splash at a small marketcap but once its 3 trillion it will be hard to push that price around . The high fees are temporary as the network has many efficiency gains and 2nd layer upgrades in the pipeline.

Lightning network is an example of a 2nd layer. imagine there are 5 people and they all want to pay each other money in various amounts, in the lightning network they can open a channel and all pay each other in it, the next day they could pay each other with whatever money they had in that channel, they can just keep doing instantaneous transactions with everyone in that channel with the amount of money they have in it. Then if they want those bitcoin to settle on the blockchain they can close that channel and all of those transactions will be settled out on the blockchain. So basically you could do a million transactions over many days and then whoever has whatever amount of money when the channel closes recieves it on the blockchain as a transaction instead of the millions of transactions they did over the payment channel. 
SegWit is best googled because it is technical and i dont know how to explain it more simply than the concise technical description other than to say it fixed some problems bitcoin had that made things like certain 2nd layer solutions impossible because of the "transaction malleability" problem. 
The transaction malleability problem was one of the things exploited to rob MtGox exchange of all its bitcoin.

You keep doing the thing of blaming people for things that they have no control of. Like getting degrees that are economically useless because of the dotcom bust that was not something they controlled.
People who are literally not needed and are dispossessed from basic resources needed for life have every right to kill others to get what they need, that is the symmetry of ethics in a system that deems some valueless dispossessed and worthy only to die.
I see people hold your same opinions and they are usually horrible people that flip-flop when the shit happens to them and they are deemed valueless by the arbitrariness of the markets. I have also seen people adhere to their twisted social darwinist ideology and kill themselves just because the factory that employed them went broke in competition with chinese factories. I respect their commitment to social darwinism when they kill themselves, but i consider it ultimately a toxic insane form of individualism that leads to societal breakdown and immiseration. 
There are forms of social organization that are better than authoritarian collectivism or market fundamentalism.

I agree you have no duty to support other people BUT, if there are laws you fund that prevent others from supporting themselves you do have a duty to compensate them for the dispossession.
Example being all the laws that make medical care and housing expensive. Or the fact that people are born without land and capital because it was stolen from their ancestors. 
If you said here is 40 acres go take care of yourself it would make more sense. 
police will smash your shelter when you build one, and destroy your gardens and arrest you for collecting rainwater when you try to take care of your own needs. This is to drive you into wage-slavery. 
Its all bullshit and there is no way to justify it. Other than saying might makes right. in which case the same can be used to take from the rich and give to the poor.

The problem is that you can know how to do lots of things useful but still have no work or capital to do them. You can know how to do lots of useful things but still not receive a living wage. 
Would you say being an Emergency Medical Tech is useful? because i was doing that and being paid $5.15 an hour which wasn't enough to live. Also i got certified to do computer repair in the late 90s and the dotcom crash happened and there simply wasn't jobs and when i finally did get one it was in a sweatshop building computers for minimum wage. I could tell an infinite number of stories like this and you can find an infinite number of ways to try to lay it upon personal responsibility but the truth is it is a mixture of both personal responsibility and things outside our individual control but not outside our collective control if we choose to create a decent society.
Because of the shitty literal starvation wages after paying rent i became a drug dealer and thief which compensated me better. Would you say that was learning to do something useful? because if the market is right selling drugs was more useful than being an EMT.
The market doesn't compensate people with no capital very well in most cases. The market does compensate rent-seekers despite them providing no value to society.
When you make people disposable commodities you will receive blowback. That may take a form that makes things even worse for society as a whole depending on how it is done. If we tax rent-seeking at 90% and distribute that as UBI we could reduce the parasite load on society. you can't think the people who are enomored by cortez are the parasites on society when 26 people have more capital than 3 billion. The system is constantly moving wealth in a pareto distribution and society needs something to alter that feedback loop so it doesn't create the conditions for its own uncontrolled demolition.
Some capitalists recognize their privilege is vulnerable and are willing to throw some crumbs to the proles. The other's sociopathic hubris will come back to bite them.

I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.
“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”
“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”
“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”
The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”
“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”
“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”
He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”
“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”
I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.
“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.
“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.
“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”
It didn’t seem like they did.
“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”
Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.
I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.
“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.
Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.
“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.
I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”
He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.
“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”
“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.
“Because I was afraid.”
“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”
I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.
“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”
He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.

When people run nodes they have to be able to store all the history of all transaction on a harddrive. This gets expensive faster when blocks are bigger. In addition it takes bandwidth which cost money, bigger block use more bandwidth. If normal people cant afford to run a node bitcoin loses its decentralized properties and it become vulnerable.
segwit is already an upgrade to the blockweight that can fit many more transactions but not enough people are using segwit compatible wallets yet such as Electrum3.0 and Trezor so the benefits arent fully felt yet.
Segwit also makes it possible to do many 2nd/3rd layer solutions so that bitcoin can scale massively and hundreds of thousands of transactions can open and settle as a single blockchain transaction, so 1mb will potentially support an incredible amount of transactions versus some weak ass scaling like an 8mb block while maintaining decentralization. You can think of one way as BTC-8X and the segwit+2nd/3rd layer solutions as BTC-100000X, btc-100000x will remain more decentralized than btc-8x.
the big problem is that bitcoin sux right now because fees are high the network is clogged and we still have to wait for 2nd/3rd layer solutions to be ready for primetime. Meanwhile altcoins are still mostly functioning cheap quick transactions. We grew too fast for the developers to keep up despite having the biggest and best dev team.
Basically its just a waiting game for the solutions to make it out of the oven fully baked, hoping alts dont steal the majority market share during this interim period of clogged pipes

The jews were allowed to purchase german made products and leave the country with them for a significant amount of time. It was an interesting hustle on the part of the nazis, worth reading about if you are a history buff. The entry price to buy a place in zion was quite high as well. Jews didn't want poor jews moving in and had strict limits on workers without substantial capital. Many moved with german goods they then had to then sale for cheap because of the flood of german products into palestine.

Dawg, ive been in the same situation and i can tell you password protected bitcoin  on some paper wallets is your best option, safety deposit boxes get seized constantly just for you not signing a paper every 6 months saying you still want to keep it, even if you prepay that shit the full 3 years. The piggly wiggly's will snatch your safety deposit box if it comes up on their radar too.
Also the world changes a lot in even one year people disappear, die, move on and forget about you. Your cash stash will most likely get spent or stolen, i had one homeboy bury his stack sealed in a pvc pipe and it rotted while he was in the pen just from the moisture that was already in the bills.

Bch doesnt have any tech over BTC except a blocksize increase and it currently processes 36 blocks per hour while bitcoin is processing 2.9 blocks per hour because of the mining power switching to the most profitable coin to mine mostly thanks to the BCH emergency difficulty adjustment keeping the difficulty super low +the pump. in 13 hours we will see what happens when BCH difficulty adjusts and then soon after they get a new difficulty adjustment algorithm. 
There are many coins besides BCH with much better dev teams and technology so this leads me to believe this is all about trying to take over the "brand" or at least get core to increase the blocksize during this interim period until the 2nd/3rd layer scaling solutions are rolled out. Bitcoin is temporarily sucking right now but lots of brilliant engineers are making sure it maintains a balance of properties to continue as a decentralized currency even if they are taking a risk of not scaling fast enough for the massive influx of users.
A lot of this is noobs panicking because they dumped tons of money into bitcoin without understanding what it is or the risks involved in such a bleeding edge technology and market place. 
BTC is playing the long game.
If you do the math on scaling the btc way versus the bch way you will see bch is ahead for maybe 2 years (at the expense of decentralization) then btc will become many orders of magnitude faster than bch. The only long term play i could see for BCH is if they pull in massive market share then just integrate all of bitcoins technology 2 years down the line.

Im not sure that statist revolution would be any better than the previous system. You could take the example of the early soviets pre-lenin when it was actually workers councils running things from the bottom without massive bureaucracy or really a "state".

How? Why?
Just getting to another planet is just a vacation fetish of people that grew up reading sci-fi and can afford such luxuries. We can't even handle shit on earth. There is not much reason to go to mars other than "cool story bro" dinner banter.
Becoming an extended interplanetary species would require so much genetic and technological modification of the human species that the thing going the distance wouldn't even be a human.
There are many systems that space travel depends on and one of those is a economy not being hobbled by the limits to growth and diminishing returns on complexity we are now encountering.
Lets make a bet. A neo Simon-Ehrlich wager.
 Elon musks business fails because the next great recession causes him to lose sales, lose investors, and lose all those juicy .gov subsidies that are the only thing keeping his ponzi scheme afloat.
In 2023 if elon is still in business and he's sent someone to mars, not even arrived just sent, i will pay you one bitcoin regardless of what a bitcoin is worth. If I'm right you pay me one bitcoin.

Despite being able to make shelter yourself out of found items, the government will destroy it because you are not paying one of those higher on the hierarchy. In our society we see this as normal like a state of nature but it is really nothing but a complexified form of slavery. Dispossession and enclosure is a control system. Man did not make the earth and to say a person born without capital or property must submit to exploitation at the hands of others is an immoral choice not based on consent.

You probably still owe them because our society is based on a clearly defined and widely accepted yet often unarticulated hierarchy. Violence done by those higher on the hierarchy to those lower is nearly always invisible, that is, unnoticed. When it is noticed, it is fully rationalized. Violence done by those lower on the hierarchy to those higher is unthinkable, and when it does occur is regarded with shock, horror, and the fetishization of the victims.
The property of those higher on the hierarchy is more valuable than the lives of those below. It is acceptable for those above to increase the amount of property they control—in everyday language, to make money—by destroying or taking the lives of those below. This is called production. If those below damage the property of those above, those above may kill or otherwise destroy the lives of those below. This is called justice.

Is debt good or bad? The answer is “Yes.”
Debt is future spending pulled forward in time. It lets you buy something now for which you otherwise don’t have cash yet.
Whether it’s wise or not depends on what you buy. Debt to educate yourself so you can get a better job may be a good idea. Borrowing money to finance your vacation? Probably not.
The problem is that many people, businesses, and governments borrow because they can. It’s been possible in the last decade only because central banks made it so cheap.
It was rational in that respect. But it is growing less so as the central banks start to tighten.
Earlier this year, I wrote a series of articles (synopsis and links here) predicting a debt “train wreck” and eventual liquidation. I dubbed it “The Great Reset.” I estimated we have another year or two before the crisis becomes evident.
Now I’m having second thoughts. Recent events tell me the reckoning could be closer than I thought just a few months ago.
Debt Doesn’t Fuel Growth Anymore
Central banks enable debt because they think it will generate economic growth. Sometimes it does. The problem is they create debt with little regard for how it will be used.
That’s how we get artificial booms and subsequent busts. We are told not to worry about absolute debt levels so long as the economy is growing in line with them.
YOU MAY ALSO LIKE
That makes sense. A country with a larger GDP can carry more debt. But that is increasingly not what is happening.
Let me give you two data points.
Hoisington Investment Management's Lacy Hunt tracks data that shows debt is losing its ability to stimulate growth. In 2017, one dollar of non-financial debt generated only 40 cents of GDP in the US. It’s even less elsewhere. This is down from more than four dollars of growth for each dollar of debt 50 years ago.
This has seriously worsened over the last decade. China’s debt productivity dropped 42.9% between 2007 and 2017. That was the worst among major economies, but others lost ground, too. All the developed world is pushing on the same string and hoping for results.
Now, if you are used to using debt to stimulate growth, and debt loses its capacity to do so, what happens next? You guessed it: The brilliant powers-that-be add even more debt.
Here’s How Much Debt We Actually Have
This is classic addiction behavior. You have to keep raising the dose to get the same high.
But centuries of history show that every prior debt run-up eventually took its toll on the economy. There is always a Day of Reckoning.
The US economy is so huge and powerful that our current $24.5 trillion government debt (including state and local) could easily grow to $40 trillion before we meet that day. We are one recession away from having a $30 trillion U.S. government debt total.
It will happen seemingly overnight. And deficits will stay well above $1 trillion per year every year after that, not unlike now.
Even though a budget deficit is under $800 billion this year, we added over $1 trillion of actual debt. That is due to “off budget” items that Congress thinks shouldn’t be part of the normal budgetary process.
It includes things like Social Security and Medicare They vary from time to time and year to year and can be anywhere from $200 billion to almost $500 billion.
And here’s the point that you need to understand. The U.S. Treasury borrows those dollars and it goes on the total debt taxpayers owe. The true deficit that adds to the debt is actually much higher than the number you see in the news.
Household and corporate debt is growing fast, too.  And not just in the U.S.
Here’s a note from Economic Cycle Research Institute’s Lakshman Achuthan:
Notably, the combined debt of the US, Eurozone, Japan, and China has increased more than ten times as much as their combined GDP [growth] over the past year.
Yes, you read that right. In the last year, the world’s largest economies are generating debt 10X faster than economic growth. Adding debt at that pace, if it continues, will boost the debt-to-GDP ratio at an alarming rate.
Lakshman continues.
Remarkably, then, the global economy—slowing in sync despite soaring debt—finds itself in a situation reminiscent of the Red Queen Effect we referenced 15 years ago, when tax cuts boosted the US budget deficit much more than GDP. As the Red Queen says to Alice in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”
This Won’t End Well
I am trying to imagine a scenario where this ends in something less than chaos and crisis. The best I can conceive is a decade-long (and possibly more) stagnation while the debt gets liquidated.
But realistically, that won’t happen because debtors won’t let it. And they outnumber lenders. For this reason, something like “the Great Reset” will happen first.
The rational course would be to delay the inevitable as long as possible. Yet in the U.S. we’re rushing it.

Bitcoin is only gaining significant value because it is gaining utility but once it gets into the flattening end of this [curve]( Bitcoin is just a money and in order to continue making "hella sweet gains bro" you need to use the bitcoins to buy things that actually make you get real income from providing something for society such as products or services.

This skepticism post shouldn't get down voted. 
The most likely reason bitcoin will fail is if it doesn't implement strong privacy features. Privacy=fungibility
Fungibility= a critical property of money. 
There is already a good solid coin with full fungibility. It will start pulling market share overtime as the old school cypherpunks have already shifted and the smart money will move there over time. Smart holdouts are just hodling btc because they expect the network effects plus implementation of true fungibility will win out over time versus a coin that rhymes with Bonero.
I think bitcoin may eventually win but if it stalls out on fungibility implementation it will eventually fail in the long run or fade out at least.

You are arguing against free markets and probably should not be involved in bitcoin.
There is no such things as whales manipulating the market. They are just voluntarily participating in the market with others voluntarily participating in the market.
If a whale sells they no longer have their coins. If they buy they no longer have the fiat they bought with. They don't know what the price will do, so therefore, they are taking a risk, can lose money and do lose money.  
They don't get bailouts.

owners will finance selling houses themselves and just receive monthly payments adjusted for deflation so they receive say $100,000 value for the house in btc.
so if they are selling for 100,000$ the first payment may be 0.1btc and as btc gets more valuable 0.01btc then 0.001btc but the dollar value will be the same at the end. they receive the full value for the house.
or else the price of houses will trend towards what people can save up to buy cash.

inflation is primarily justified by economists as a way to stop "sticky wages" which is a propagandist way of saying people dont like to earn less every year so we need to trick them into earning less by having the dollar be worth less.
the other justification is that inflation makes people want to spend money since it is devaluing , spending money stimulates the economy.  This starts with the assumption that stimulating the economy is good , which is provably false from an ecological perspective since the economic activity is directly coupled to environmental destruction. Happiness is much higher in communities where conspicuous consumption and toxic materialism is reduced. 
If happiness and survival are important to you then stopping inflation is important.

They will make money with bonds because when they lower the rates even more the value goes up even on a neg yield bond.
See bond convexity. double digit ~50% returns going from -1% to -3%
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:12:46
If you have a 30 year bond yielding -1% and interest rates drop to -3% the face value of the -1% bond goes up 50% then you sell it and pocket cash. 50% returns during a recession

The emergence of blockchain creates and interesting pathway for the emergence and managing [polylegal]( systems.
 
A cypherpunk [future]( that will take people by surprise in the real world just like bitcoin.
Another related topic is the economics that exist in game worlds like [second life which had billion dollar economies]( now there are distributed permissionless systems being built that will have their own economies. Previous attempts grew economies but they were throttled and basically killed because they conflicted with laws and were centralized. complex banking ,gambing and other industries were a thriving and dynamic growth force in digital worlds. These will be unleashed again but they won't be able to be crushed. see decentraland.org for one attempt at a decentralized metaverse
The combination of polylegal systems and a decentralized metaverse are ripe space for some pioneering research. You will be one of the first to expose these emerging phenomenon to the world.
I could easily bang out 25 pages on those subjects, 
You could spend 5 pages just on explaining the metaverse concept and history , 5 pages on polylegal systems concept and history, then 15 pages talking about the future of economics and law in these spaces and how much of a paradigm shift potential there is.
If you need info or want help with the paper just pm me.

In an energy crisis energy gets more expensive. If it gets more expensive and makes mining less profitable then miners switch off until either the btc price rises to make it economically viable or energy prices come back down. When miners shut off blocks will go slower then the difficulty will readjust to make mining easier.

you really don't understand.
once btc stabilizes you just have a nice savings account and currency. Then hodling btc becomes an oppurtunity cost compared to earning more bitcoin by purchasing productive capital like say for example a phosphorus mine and fertilizer factory. then you start earning more bitcoin and increasing your btc supply rather than just sitting on it.

I think people involved in bitcoin are pretty versed in economics and have made the rational decision to not support inflationary policies because it isn't in their interest. People want to save and then deploy capital instead of having the growth of tomorrow today at the expense of the future when the system crashes from the economic distortions of the particular neoliberal economic doctrine they teach you in basic econ courses.

You are correct in thinking something like litecoin could steal bitcoins Marketshare most rapidly . people are pricing in an expected scaling solution to bitcoin,  if it doesn't occur expect the money to flow out into a coin that manages to scale like litecoin+segwit.
There is a reason litecoin is up 7X and that is all the smart money hedging against failed segwit implementation in bitcoin. If segwit gets through expect litecoin to crash back down again because its utility over bitcoin will be negligible.

I understand your point. My point is purely that market distortions are worked out eventually because pricing cannot be shifted away from supply/demand equilibrium forever, these shifts are often violent and crisis inducing. 
No shortage of historical examples across time and place. 
Navigating the "imperfect markets" is how to make bucks by capturing the value from those massive shifts. 
Bitcoin is just one version of a bet on those market distortions breaking down,  and "prices in" that probability into itself over time.

Im not pretending it is collapsing , it clearly isn't, and if japan is an example we can extend ourselves much further. 


MMT is subject to both neutralizing dampening effects of the market on its efficacy, and blow-ups, you mistake theory for reality, and mistake the the functionality during interim smooth sailing as validation. The failure mode is in the tails. 
**With a large total debt even small upticks in interest rate can consume massive percents of the total yearly budget.**
Imagine recessions cutting into gov revenue further versus these rosy projections
Seriously though the math on raising interest rates is so bad we cannot do it, in fact interest rate raises have stalled for a reason. Remember multiple variable will move when interest rates move so you don't just look at interest moving above some threshold, you also look at the thresholds moving as well in a synergistically bad way.
In fiscal year 2019, interest will be greater than the amount spent on income security — a category that includes programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Supplemental Security Income, and unemployment compensation.
In fiscal year 2020, interest payments will exceed the amount that the federal government spends on children, according to projections from the Urban Institute.
In fiscal year 2021, interest will surpass the combined amount spent on Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and subsidies for the purchase of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
In fiscal year 2022, interest spending will exceed all mandatory spending other than that for Social Security and the major health care programs. That budget category, known as “other mandatory” spending, includes programs for income security, military retirement, and agriculture.
In fiscal year 2023, the federal government will spend more on interest than defense.
Interest costs are expected to continue climbing beyond the next 10 years and are projected to be the third largest category in the federal budget by 2026 (after just Social Security and Medicare), the second largest category in 2046, and the single largest category by 2048.
Over the next ten years, the United States is on course for routine trillion-dollar annual deficits in the federal budget and the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in its history. Beyond the next decade, large and rising projected annual deficits will push the national debt steadily upwards, reaching almost 200 percent of GDP by 2049 (up from 78 percent today) under plausible scenarios. The projections derive from rising spending on health care, Social Security, and interest payments and, as of yet, an unwillingness either to reduce such outlays or provide the revenues needed to finance them. The projections assume steady economic growth and relatively low interest rates, so they could be far worse under alternative scenarios. 
 high and rising debt could result in a market panic that leads investors to demand higher interest rates. This spike in rates, in turn, would erode the value of the U.S. debt held around the world (currently about $14 trillion), triggering a selloff of federal bonds. Given the structural role those safe assets play in the financial system, the result could be a global financial crisis.
Alternatively, a fiscal crisis could take the form of rapid inflation. If borrowing were sufficiently high or demand for U.S. debt sufficiently low, the federal government could find itself printing new money in order to pay its debt. While countries can often engage in modest monetary expansion or seigniorage without disruption, continuously expanding the money supply to chase ever-rising deficits is a recipe for hyperinflation. The implementation of new heterodox economic practices designed to facilitate such printing could itself spark this inflation by undermining price stability.
High debt could also force the country to engage in austerity during an economic recession in order to avoid one of the above scenarios. This austerity itself could create a crisis by expanding unemployment and holding the economy well below potential for an extended period of time.
Importantly, while high and rising debt increases the likelihood of a fiscal crisis, it is impossible to predict what might spark such a crisis. One possibility is a change in the attitudes of foreign creditors, who for economic or geopolitical reasons may choose to sharply adjust their debt holdings. A recession or financial crisis could also bleed into a fiscal crisis, as has been the case with numerous fiscal crises through history. A fiscal crisis could also emerge from a market panic over the sustainability of U.S. fiscal policy and reliability of the country’s institutions, which could be undermined by the adoption of new fringe economic theories like MMT.

The popular immiseration and regressive nature of the USA tax system doesn't show up in the narrative and power elites have a distorted view of how bad things are. There is virtually zero wiggle room to increase taxes on non-elites, and captured power structures that make increases on elites politically impossible.


Do the math, you may be surprised by what you find. It doesn't take much to hit the level. How near it is, is an unknown. 


US debt has already been teetering and downgraded many times. 
Printing money is just a temporary magic trick that is nominal and doesn't solve the underlying problems. the fed cannot buy up debt forever, the market it is a dynamic system that neutralizes their attempts at naive interventionism. The exceptionalist mindset will lead to the same catastrophes as every other country that tries to print itself out of collapse.

No what i am say is if there are things where supply and demand do not determine the value and instead coercive institutions do it is distorting the market. **Market** . If prices are determined by the decree of bureaucrats it is not **MARKET** .
If you define the market as a place where prices and rates are not determined by free and voluntary exchange reaching an equilibrium then you are definitional dodging "markets".
Was the soviet unions economy a undistorted market economy?, Clearly no, but you can hold off the  day of reckoning for a long time until markets violently shift out the distortions.

It is theft when people appropriate and exclude others from nature. That is initiating aggression. Take for example a beach, i could once use the beach for free now someone can claim they own all the beaches and create a state of less freedom for everyone then say I'm violating them by not paying them money. That is just claiming "might makes right" . That is why defensive violence against usurpers of nature is justified.

Selling coin into the market with the expectation of lowering the price and then expecting to pay that lower price otc is extremely high risk speculation, the otc sellers still only sell for consensually agreed upon prices and they are not weak hands.

all those transactions incur risk and usually cost to the person engaged in those activities and all the sells and buys only happen with counterparties agreeing to be on the other side of those trades. Even if a person is trading with themselves generating volume you can still buy or sell their coins. The "fake" volume by that market participant is still actual trades and you have no reasonable expectation for volume to be there when you want it. pump and dumping incurs huge financial risks for the pump and dumper

I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.
“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”
“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”
“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”
The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”
“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”
“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”
He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”
“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”
I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.
“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.
“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.
“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”
It didn’t seem like they did.
“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”
Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.
I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.
“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.
Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.
“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.
I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”
He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.
“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”
“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.
“Because I was afraid.”
“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”
I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.
“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”
He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.

If you see massive gains i would suggest buying something real for them. A piece of farmland with a free and clear home near an area where work is available within commuting distance. Even in the best case scenario bitcoin is just numbers with notional value. Cover the Utility required for survival as primary and money as secondary.

1. Don't trade bitcoin, use it as savings and currency as adoption happens.
2. Dollars are the dominant global currency and it is being destroyed slowly by bad policy arbitrariliy controlled by rent-seeking parasitic fragilistas. Bitcoin is simply an alternative minus the people who think making you lose savings and lose real wages every year through inflation is a good idea.
3. get a hardware wallet like a trezor or ledger and then buy from some exchange with a good reputation.
4. bitcoin can fail, but it can fail in a different way than fiat currencies. Hedge your bets. If dollar policy continues it will boost bitcoin, if bitcoin fails it will not boost dollars, so there is an asymmetrical bet there with a convex pay off. 
At least dabble in a little bitcoin to learn about it.

All these economists are missing the real underlying problem, which is perfectly illuminated by biophysical economics. Gail Tverberg for an introduction, Nate Hagens for a good Youtube talk ,
For a good blog and research  You may be interested in "surplus energy economics" look it up "SEEDS".
More debt cannot create more growth because the fundamental driver of growth at the biophysical (non-abstract reality) level is surplus energy, this is why the debt to growth model is seeing diminishing returns.

Rapid currency shifts happen during crisis. See the collapse of the USSR in the bloc countries. other examples abound. People ready to provide better means of exchange have made fortunes in the rapid transitions. Even Soros started hustling as a currency trader in his teens during crisis.

you should write a really concise FAQ with all of these things people say so everyone can just copy paste respond to these dipshits without having to address each one every time.

It takes a while to "price-in" sometimes but many of those companies may be exposed to the deleterious consequences of brexit and thus their value and profitability did decrease. 
I posted some academic papers a few months ago about historical examples where it prices in, specifically one about germany was memorable. It is fairly ubiquitous and uncontroversial.
