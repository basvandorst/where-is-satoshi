How will this make the seller angry? If it's hedged, Silkroad takes the hit. If it's not.. well.. this is exactly the risk.

As you can probably tell from the comments all over the place: Noone knows, nothing is certain. Some people still think it was a DDoS and will recover, others say it will stabilize and some say it is crashing. Do as you feel.
EDIT: Personally, I have sold enough to cover my initial investment (Just about $500) 7-8 hours ago. Whatever is left in a couple of days/weeks/months is just a bonus. Sooo.. I would say that is a secure plan if you can still cover your investment AND have BTC.

Really? You create an account for begging? That's low.

I believe I have read into it. How is what I said wrong?
Maybe it is kind of a dick move right now, but to call it a scam or to believe that the seller should get angry is dumb.
Also, the seller can cancel any order for whatever reason he likes to. If he thinks it is a dick move to buy right now, he can simply deny the order.
EDIT: Sorry, didn't see you're OP, thought you disagreed.

Man kan bruge BitcoinNordic, men 9% til dem lyder som en sindssygt høj pris at betale. Ja, det kan sagtens tjene sig selv ind igen meget hurtigt som det går lige nu, men de sidste par gange jeg har købt har jeg brugt [Bitstamp]( :)

EDIT: Disregard that. I have since recieved my chips!
