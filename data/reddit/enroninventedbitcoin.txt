The insanity of the crowd here is part of the bubble. Some are paid shills, others are hopeful investors. I agree with your post sir and thank you for speaking the truth.

I do not fit your framework. I own lots of coins. I have many many transactions under my belt. I like it as a currency. Beyond that its a massive scam. Enron had its good points too but in the end it was still a financial scam.

I'd rather hear the views of a full fledged Systems or Network Administrator rather than an "IT guy" to be honest.

I have some Enron stock for sale. It will never crash. Want to buy some?

Forbes voted Enron most innovative company six years running too. Hmmm..

So Grandma is the new China? Sounds legit.

Any investment can be profitable. Enron made many people rich before it made many more poor. The technical issues I see are:
Transaction clearing time, block chain size, anonymous founders, volatility of price, complexity of use, fragility of the network, lack of trust in and transparency of exchanges, potential unknown insecurities of the network, government intervention, maximum of seven transactions a second and shills everywhere I look.
All of those issues can be fixed. We fixed up tcp, udp and http real nice but it took 30 years. Since your friend just wants to accept it as a currency the risk is lower but he should keep in mind the value could drop to zero before he can get out and factor that into his daily routine.

A common coiner argument is that the bitcoin protocol will one day be as important as the tcp or http protocols. BTC is a unit of account. Bitcoin is a protocol.

I am so disappointed I missed the chance to invest in Enron!

You didn't understand his post and neither did the people who upvoted you.

Where can I preorder such a device?

I was going to suggest he tell his friend Bitcoin will be as important as Enron eventually. Hmmm...

The information in your link is accurate. Notice all the down votes you received? Bitcoin was never intended to be this popular. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:15:11
The herd mentality here is how you know something is wrong. Folks want to compare bitcoin to things like tcp and http. Those were written with a public RFC and didn't include an emotional fan club. It was all about what was technically best. Bitcoin resembles Enron. Voted most innovative company for many years by Forbes. Forbes loves bitcoin now. Hmm.

Yes, its always good when you can increase your profits based on lies. That usually works out really well in the long run.

I invested 50% of my saving in Enron and I live in a homeless shelter now. I think your idea is great.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:17:46
You just don't get it! Its a new paradigm! Customers and merchants will be happy to wait! Your time is almost up, the downvotes are here to silence you already. Remember, logic and facts are not allowed here.
