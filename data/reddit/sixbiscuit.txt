I just ordered some dog food on pets.com. Afterwards I rented a Blu-Ray from Kozmo and had it delivered with some Ben and Jerry's. I also paid for it all in flooz! 
The internet of the late 90's was just a fad.

I must have missed that bill that made Bitcoin legal tender.

These are some of the most minor fucking issues associated with buying a house. I'm pretty convinced the author has never been involved in a real estate transaction before. 
The idea that you can just digitally look up if your foundation is cracking is fucking stupid. Also it's no one's fucking business what I spend on a plumber.

You're never going to make a phishing e-mail that looks honestly legitimate and even if it does people are going to get redirected to say, ChaseeBanque.com and most will then realize what's up and go away or put in bogus information just to mess with them. 
So if you can get horrible misspellings by someone they're not going to notice chaseebanque.com when they click the link.
