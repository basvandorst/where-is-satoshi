Yeah, they sure have some interesting miners on that spOOndoolies-tech site...
This is a scam, walk along.
Edit: if you look at the breadcrumbs you will see that they just changed the text of the SP35 page

Noone can answer that question simply.
For a simple answer you need to make the assumption that the dollar collapsed and BTC replaced it. If you do not make this assumption the answer is between 0 and infinity but there is no way to actually give a price.
You get the same kind of calculation: what does it cost to produce 1 pizza and you sell it for more. Everything you buy as a consumer has been manufactured in some way, shape or form and you always buy it at cost + profit for the seller.
The only difference between selling a pizza for $10 and 0.025 BTC is that the ingredients were purchased using dollars so they will have to pay their suppliers in dollars. If they could pay and receive everything in BTC they could price everything in BTC.
Is it easy to achieve this?
No, that's why it hasn't been done within 6 years.

It seems that you don't understand what you are saying.
If you can now buy an eg for $1(for simplicity in calculations) but the value of your currency drops(i.e. you can buy less with $1) then you could get $10 or even $100 eggs.
In the US you have an average inflation of 2-2.5% over the last 10 years.
So in theory if you bought an egg last year for $1 it should cost $1.02 today.
If you get hyperinflation(50+%) prices can rise rapidly.
In this case you could pay several billion dollars(in zimbabwe an egg costs $50Billion) per egg, simply because your dollar is not worth the paper it is printed on.
About your actual question:
If you were to run an entirely BTC denominated business(you buy and sell everything with BTC) you would sell your eggs for more than it cost you to produce them(or less if you want to get rid of them quickly). For this you would take things like the purchase cost of your chickens, the rent/mortgage of your farm, the chicken feed, etc., etc. and calculate a price per egg to pay these and make a profit.
So for example:
* egg production: 1000 eggs
* rent: 3.5BTC
* feed: 1BTC
* cost per chicken: 0.5BTC
* Total costs per egg = 0.005 = (3.5+1+0.5)/1000
So your price per egg could be 0.006 BTC each and you would make a profit of (0.006-0.005)*1000 = 1BTC
That is how you come up with a price for an egg in BTC.
After this simple calculation you obviously get other factors like the prices on the farms around you and the purchasers from supermarkets etc. But this is the simple version.

So, to translate this into english:


Nothing really here. Except for the "Nothing has changed" line which can mean a thousand things.


 "There is no **requirement** that BitStamp **proactively** share the data"
So they can get around this by sharing the data **voluntarily** or by only sharing it **upon request**.






As usual with emails about spying on your customers, they can't reall say anything definitively because they will have to hand over everything they have if anyone comes knocking. 
The only thing they did actually say is that a local regulator cannot force them to hand over all their data about people the regulator has nothing to do with which is stored in a different country than the regulator resides in. If that is an exception from the norm then I'm happy that I do not live in the U.S.

This post is a scam.
If you follow all the links you end up at spondoolies-tech.CO instead of .COM.
This device does not exist on their .COM website, and it will not exist because the company is bankrupt.
