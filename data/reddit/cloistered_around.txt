You want us to give you a magic wand that spews money and are upset that we tell you it doesn't exist. You need to take a step back a realize what happened, here... you do not *have* 750,000 anymore and do NOT have a "guarantee" of getting it back. Forget the 750k--**you do not have it**. You have 340k now, and you owe your sister 370k. "You can do this?" What exactly makes you think that? You lost more than half the inheritance and somehow think this will change? That your "investing" abilities will skyrocket and you can make a bajillion dillars? It is nuts to think you can continue doing the same thing and the results will somehow change... that you can "unlose" it. You *cannot.* You do not *have* 750k--you have 340k and owe your sister 370k.
You screwed up. It's hard to admit and I understand that you would like to un-screw up. But you gambled your inheritance away as well as some of your sisters, and now you want to take the chance of losing the rest. It is NOT yours to lose! *You are seriously considering breaking your word to your father and leaving zero money to your sister.* If this happens, don't be surprised when she takes you to court for her portion and wins.
Could you gamble your way back up to 750k? Sure. Maybe. But you are far more likely to lose what you have left... actually, lose what your *sister* has left. You, friend, have nothing. You lost it.
"I burned a stack of cash, guys. Please help me tape it back together." "It's burned? Well then, you can't tape it together. " "...Fuck you! Help me tape this cash back together!"
