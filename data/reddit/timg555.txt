Nothing gets people behind something like porn does just saying.
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:02:41
Yeah I'll look into it once I can get scrypt coin mining to work on my system without killing my gpu.
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:29:14
Well yeah but I didn't know about them when they were 10 a piece.  If anything it should be I wish I would of mined them when using a cpu was viable. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:43:18
Well the symbol in the box is a K.
@_date: 2014-02-01 01:31:21
I'll have to look into that.
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:50:48
I know but my gpu seems to just hate them mined btc just fine but scrypt mining is a no go so far.
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:37:42
Lucky I'm too broke even in BTC to get any from them but I do love me some jerky.
@_date: 2014-01-31 23:06:35
By time I started mining my gpu wasn't even all that effective.
@_date: 2014-02-01 00:25:36
What does it switch to?
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:25:23
Good on you for laying down a bit of knowledge.
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:31:18
I pretty much buy all my pc parts from Newegg so this is good news.
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:43:39
Oh I did had it set up according to the getting started guide.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:00:58
[Well you know.](
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:23:07
I have like 4 dollars worth of bitcoins at the moment so it will need to go way up to get me excited.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:37:19
Thanks for the input I'm thinking about building a rig just for mining pretty soon.
@_date: 2013-04-30 05:01:33
Probably nothing I don't have enough to be mad about it becoming illegal.
@_date: 2013-07-05 15:58:18
My 5850 I think you may be doing something wrong.
@_date: 2013-07-05 16:25:28
That I could not tell you didn't really have a way to measure it.  Oh and them temps were from the card running about an hour.
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:12:40
That's what I was thinking.
@_date: 2013-05-20 23:25:17
Here's the lists I use [1]( and [2](
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:19:52
I only have .02 bitcoins this is going to take a while.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:45:28
Other country's are always trying to get Americans to donate money so why shouldn't we do the same?
@_date: 2013-07-05 15:07:05
I'd just like to say I was only getting hitting around 50°c and 300 Mh/s so 64 seems high to me.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:34:51
And how do I go about tuning it I'm using GUIminer and I don't see to many options as far as settings.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:52:52
No worry about things getting hot I'm actually using my gaming rig to mine and recently I upgraded the cooling on my GPU.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:38:38
I only have a 5850 and cant run it all day.
@_date: 2013-05-23 17:19:12
From what I found out a ZTEX USB-FPGA Module 1.15y would work as well as 3 of my current video cards so maybe I'll looking into ordering some.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:58:17
I'm currently at .005 of a bitcoin and I'm thinking I need some more video cards.
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:55:38
I'm there with you dang video card lol.
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:50:19
They seem expensive Id have to do some research to see if they are worth ordering in bulk.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:35:36
Yeah its pretty crazy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:48:35
Thanks for actually trying to help me out instead of just down voting me.
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:35:30
Isn't 2800 watts power consumption a bit excessive?
@_date: 2013-08-30 13:52:56
So being that most of you said this hub isn't all that great what would be a good one to run more than 4 erupters on?
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:23:50
I've not even mined enough to get paid by the pool I am part of maybe someday Ill be able to tip like that.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:35:28
38 BTC or 975 usd do the math people.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:09:38
Probably because its something most country's have.
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:54:32
@_date: 2013-07-30 21:30:00
You should see if he will take beads that was currency once.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:20:54
I was not aware I was its telling me I still have 1 point.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:23:09
I can almost afford a snickers lol.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:39:21
Well the best my current card is doing is 290 Mhash/s and that BFL miners not even shipping yet so whose to say.
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:35:02
I don't think the company I work for would go for that but I've considered doing my most marketable skill for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:18:25
I just got the newest Humble Bundle with bitcoins as well I may be broke but I can at least be entertained.
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:17:35
I hope some where local to me starts taking bitcoins for food and drink.
@_date: 2013-08-30 13:50:57
Mine sound like a dust buster.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:19:21
I just started mining them and don't even have a full one yet but I'm sure when I have some to spend they will be used well.
@_date: 2013-07-16 02:35:17
Oh thanks for the help.
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:38:32
Building computers.
@_date: 2013-08-27 13:25:05
Huh what wait a minute something here seems a little off.
@_date: 2013-04-30 12:19:27
Buy an asics miner and get more.
@_date: 2013-08-06 19:43:59
I got like 2 usd in bitcoins I'm not doing shit lol.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:11:30
In a pool and my hashes usually sit around 200 Mhash/s with my ATI 5850.
@_date: 2013-07-20 20:35:46
I like how is being tracked.
@_date: 2013-10-12 01:08:56
3200 isn't normal for a used laptop but on Apple it is.  Apple not even once.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:17:28
Probably to just donate locally if hes really worried about the conversion rate.
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:04:35
I think I'm sitting on like .0002 coins only from faucets but I don't hit them as often as I should.
@_date: 2013-07-16 00:11:57
It don't explain anything about the beer thing though.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:41:15
Maybe some day.
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:00:56
Its a Sapphire 5850 oced at gpu 775mhz and Memory at 1125 I also use guiminer with -v -w128 flags.
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:15:57
Convert all the change.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:02:41
I mean thats just what I have it set at my mining rig is also my gaming rig so I just leave the setting as they are.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:26:28
What a ripoff I don't believe the person will break even for a long time.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:42:15
I had thought about doing this on my own stream.
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:01:35
So what company are shipping them from what I found all are shipping 2nd quarter 2013 still.
@_date: 2013-07-16 01:53:18
I'd be interested to know if its just a programmed number or if it knows the price of a certain brand of beer at the moment its typed.
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:26:02
I haven't bought any but I've been hitting up faucets and mining.
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:21:40
My thing is I seem to remember FPGAs being only about as good as gpus for mining.  Don't get me wrong its not a bad deal but they were like 200 dollars or so for the best model if they are only as good as a 200 dollar video card its not worth it.
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:53:10
Some one posted here on how to make your own ASICs miner for under 200. That is something I find would be worth doing even if I have to pay some one with soldering skills to assemble the thing.
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:53:34
At least with the 7970s I can game.
@_date: 2013-07-05 16:07:43
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:47:08
When I can get some more btc I would be willing to do a review of the jerky I order.
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:43:38
I donated 5 usd worth my self.
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:04:47
A good idea.
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:49:42
The avalon ones are currently out of stock and cost like 8000 usd so thats kind of out of the question 4x 7970s are more likely.
@_date: 2013-05-20 12:34:56
I've been mining and hitting up faucets.
@_date: 2013-05-20 12:44:23
Pretty good actually.  When I get home as I'm at work currently I'll post a list of ones that usually pay.
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:02:43
Ok I'll check it out.
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:41:36
I spend in moderation usually on Humble Bundles.
