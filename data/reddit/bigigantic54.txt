Could someone please ELI5?

There is no way it's FDIC insured. I need to see proof.
Even brokerage firms such as Fidelity and Schwab aren't FDIC insured.

You have the right idea. The concept applies to all investments, not just crypto.

That doesn't mean it's true.
My father worked with (for) Jamie dimon personally around 10 years ago. He was telling me about a time dimon released a press statement about an issue saying that he (dimon) had no knowledge of a partcular matter when he 100% did. 
He's lied in the past. He's not above lying now

It may be pedantic but it makes a difference if I understood op correctly. I interpreted op saying coinbase is FDIC insured meaning any crypotcurrency stored there will also be protected. OP made it seem like any assets are safe on coinbase due to coinbase being FDIC insured.

I never argued that. But how many people actually store USD with coinbase? Probably not many since that's not it's purpose.
Buying a cryptocurrency with insider information isn't subject to an investigation. It's not FDIC insured. 
The person I replied to said coinbase is FDIC insured. They are incorrect. Only usd on coinbase in insured. But most assets on coinbase aren't going to be USD.

right? I'm so pissed. They fuck everyone over even those who weren't doing anything wrong. 
Fuck this.
