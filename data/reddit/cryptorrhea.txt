Maybe 600.  Maybe 150.  Maybe 300.  Neither variant would surprise me a great deal.  I think anyone who fancies themselves able to predict the future value of speculative assets with no information advantage over the market is full of it.

How are you arriving at these numbers?
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:06:28
Option 1:  find the resources to manipulate the market or get inside information you can leverage
Option 2: get played by much savvier traders who do have those things
Option 3:  don't gamble your money away day trading

First it rose to 600! Then to 430!  Then to 300! Nothing can stop this force of nature!

You could make a case for it being a ridiculously wasteful use of energy, but it's pretty much the opposite of "hacking".  I'd suggest actually reading up on how bitcoin works before posting silly threads, you don't seem to understand even the basics.

Step 1: hodl bitcoin
Step 2: ???
Step 3:  the world adopts bitcoin
Step 4: ???
Step 5:  world peace, end of poverty, end of inequality and injustice and corruption
Forget the internet, no one has made a made a rational case for how bitcoin would address this  even if every human being had a gigabit pipe plugged straight into his brain jack.  The world's economic problems are not reducible to payment systems and banks.

Does your "vision" extend beyond sitting on your coins waiting for someone else to actually make the applications that will drive bitcoin's stagnated growth?
@_date: 2015-02-28 17:28:25
Because if I didn't have to worry that my one bitcoin may buy one dollar-denominated iPhone one day, and half of one a week later, I could just use bitcoin to store value, but as it is, I'd want to hold bitcoin for as little time as possible before cashing out into something more stable.
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:28:48


Someone could waste an endless amount of energy mining a worthless altcoin no one wants, that does not *directly* give it value.  Much like government-issued fiat, a bitcoin is an intrinsically useless token that derives its value from supply and demand as a method of transferring/storing value.

Except it's actually a 3d-printed robotic horse. There's no carriage yet, but someone will eventually make a really good one once everyone's bought the horses.  There's no safety restraints and the horse does have the tendency to stomp its riders into puddles of gore but if you strap yourself in with a roll of duct tape or two it's totally safe, stop being such a big baby, this is the future of transport.   It also requires constant feeding and shits uncontrollably in the street but hey, the billion cars on the roads are no environmental picnic either, and such is the cost of freedom. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:56:35
Anyone who thinks bitcoin is not a risky investment has deluded themselves.  Put your money in an index fund if you want safety.

I love when you drop the whole pretense of bitcoin being this world-changing instrument of financial liberation and equality and get right down to the neckbeard get-rich-quick scheme nitty gritty of it. You're going to sit on your ever-growing bit-hoard as it becomes worth obscene amounts of money because everyone else totally isn't doing the same thing but are actually silly enough to *use* it.
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:47:22
If bitcoin was a serious monetary system, sure.  But for a nifty distributed pyramid scheme, that's just dandy.

Does CNN audit his bitcoin holdings?
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:18:14
For the same reason you wouldnt put all your money into a penny stock of a company that makes no money: its goddamn stupid.
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:57:40
Bitcoin is a distributed and fundamentally unregulated market.  Nothing is stopping anyone from doing things you don't like with it (including wall street, governments, banks and all the other libertarian boogeymen) Feel free to not use coinbase or create a more appealing alternative.
@_date: 2015-02-28 16:49:03
Those data centers use as much energy as running enormous operations like Youtube or Facebook or Google requires.  I'm guessing they are actually quite efficient, since waste cuts into their bottom line.  Bitcoin mining is *purposefully* inefficient, a presumably necessary evil of its distributed design, essentially making it too expensive for someone to attack the network.
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:01:33
What is it about bitcoin that makes people ignore all investing common sense?  Unless you know something the market doesn't, putting "a fair chunk" of your life savings into one risky speculative investment is not a good idea.
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:47:07
Where's the network?  The volume of bitcoin transactions that are commercially significant is absolutely miniscule compared to regular money and if some other digital currency enables a true killer app, bitcoin will become myspace ( that much quicker since a shitton of people actually used myspace).
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:32:51
The volume of commerce transacted in bitcoin is insignificant, if another protocol enables something that is truly attractive to mainstream users, BTC will fade like a dog fart in the breeze.
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:29:44
So how is this good for bitcoin?  The world economy is just going to abandon the whole idea of loans?  Why on earth would they, considering loans are vital to running a competitive business?

Not that I'm surprised that some bitcoiners' understanding of banking never went past piggy banks, but no, it isn't (at least in any modern sense of the word).

Define success?
for the average person, I think facilitating transactions on a service like the silk road is the most useful part of bitcoin.  And in that regard, i think it is already successful.  
For broader use as a payment system? There are existing systems I have no reason to not use.
As for the more far fetched libertarian future-of-money theories, I don't think that's even worthy of serious consideration.  Bitcoin doesn't scale, there is no clear path or reason for it to displace the existing system, its mining incentive sructure will lead to the network being centralized trust all over again, and austrian school cranks are the only people not laughing about its economics.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:09:46
I think it's that the existing system works just fine for the vast majority of potential bitcoin users, and most people wading into the crypto-muck are doing it either for ideological reasons, to become rich early adopters, or for shady transactions, not because of its present usefuless as a currency or a payment system for the average use case.  Scams, hackers, and viruses did not stop the internet's growth in the 90s, because its incredible usefulness could not be ignored.  I'm not sure what I'm losing by ignoring bitcoin (except all these amazing possibilities that haven't happened yet).
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:52:03
There's a long answer, but here's the short one: Bitcoin's security (cryptography aside) comes from being a distributed, decentralized platform where one person running a malicious version of the code would simply be ignored in the consensus.
