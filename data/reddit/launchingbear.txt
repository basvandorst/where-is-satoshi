Question, why were you looking into the wallet in the first place? Also, what do you gain in your pursuit? 
Everything you post and any case that gets developed is outside of any reddit's control. There is, quite literally, nothing anyone on here can do about it, yet you are so caught up in it. "Someone else will be able to continue the work, it's free." - Why do you care?
"For the rest, I can track the owner's funds, **but I cannot find out who he/she is**." - Again, *WHY DO YOU CARE?*
Also, these aren't dangerous "drug lords", they (were) coders with balls. You can sleep safely.

OP is a FED. Just letting you all know.
He's been following a dead wallet for 5 years, then posts a bunch of analysis immediately after activity, then proceeds to ask for more questions.
Don't assist him/her. It's a guaranteed crash if these noobs get a hold of it. Our chances are better with the stranger who was patient enough to sit quietly for 5 years, letting the price skyrocket to ATH and even plummet. **FBI are weak hands!**

What are you talking about? You have too much faith in the system lol
As for traceable, no it is not. They aren't cashing out to USD, they are washing it. Once that's done, good bye to your "perfectly traceable" ideology. 
I don't believe they wish to manipulate the market, that would only make it more difficult to get rid of their coins (not something they want, especially after being detected). I don't think Tether has anything to do with it either. If that were the case, why didn't they go through with this plan back in Nov-Jan? They were printing multiple times more than than the $100M they're printing right now. It wouldn't have appeared as coincidental as it does right now.
Binance and Bitfinex is based out of Hong Kong, outside of U.S. jurisdiction (there is decent support that they are American). Note that most of China does extradite, but not Hong Kong. Coincidence? Nah. So you can kiss your exchange support good bye, they cannot and will not do anything.
Lastly, this account is over 5 years old. Back then, the value of it was around $7 million, a fraction of what it's worth today. I don't believe they had the expectation that it would become anywhere near this valuable and in such little time - nobody did. 5 years ago, every week Bitcoin was dying next week.

They didn't steal anything and this wallet has nothing to do with Gox. The only ones stealing are the government. Where do you think the money goes after it is taken, redistributed to its citizens? LOL
Whoever owns this wallet was very smart and very patient. No one will catch them.

How do you listen for payment?

-OP account is a few days old
-OP has been watching a dead wallet related to a criminal account, day-in-day-out
-OP reports a detailed analysis immediately, utilizing a known methodology among criminal investigators
-OP wants to know details regarding the identity of the wallet holder
-OP wants as much detail on where the money is going
-OP jokingly mentions how amazing FBI and CIA tools must be 
-Many OP supporters have new accounts as well
Can't buy the hat, it's mined using POC (Proof-of-Conspiracy).

He's either a federal agent, there are many hints that he's left.
Or, he's just a dude with no life. The latter is a bit difficult to believe, since it's hard to imagine someone with so little purpose in their life, that they need to track half decade old wallets that were completely idle until recently.

This chart makes more sense than anything else I've come across on Tradingview.
