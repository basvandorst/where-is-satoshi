That's piggybacking off of the existing centralized debit/credit card network then, isn't it?

I came into a small cash windfall and turned it into Bitcoin and am purposefully trying to use it for day-to-day spending as an experiment.  I specifically did not buy it because I expect it to hodl it while it goes to the moon, although I won't complain about the gain.
I'm both put off by the high mining fees (in terms of $) I need to pay to do anything and annoyed at how few merchants accept it (unless I buy gift cards with it, which have additional fees on top).  I find myself batching up orders from merchants that do take it so that the cost of the mining fee is lower as a %age of the transaction.
There's nothing wrong with any of this per se; to some degree it forces me to spend less impulsively so it's good for that, but it's a bit underwhelming that even with all of the middlemen cut out it ends up costing more and/or forcing me to wait longer for every day sized purchases. 
That was my position.  Sorry if I haven't followed development as closely as you so therefore I must be trolling for not knowing about this Lightning Network proposal.

Fuck our backward society.    Glad Bitcoin helps.

I'm pretty sure outlawing exchanging BTC for USD and/or reclassifying BTC as a currency (which would compete with the dollar, which is not allowed in the US) would vaporize 99.9% of the interest in Bitcoin.

Your link says this


and yet the US government crushed this one
(the first comment in the link you pasted also rebuts the claim by citing the same Liberty Dollar)
EDIT: also this other one.  Some guy also tried to issue checks backed by a private pool of assets and the US Office of the Comptroller said these must not be negotiated for dollars.  Now the guy's a fugitive
Seems like the US government has wide leeway (i.e. arguments that stand up in court) to shut alternative currencies down if they want to.  Significantly more easily than destroying all of the computers and people with knowledge...

I was pretty sure the US Government would kill Bitcoin back in the day, given how hostile it was to other alternate currencies.  So, that led me to bet against it at the time.
Ho hum. :)
