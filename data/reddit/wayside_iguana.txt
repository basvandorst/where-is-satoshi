Nah, the blockchain works because the algorithm is followed along with certain variables meeting expectations verifying nothing fishy is going on.
Monero has an opaque ledger, but can be verified through hash rate, fees, and the coinbase transaction being public to monitor emission.

It's not fungible at all. The Bitcoin blockchain is still completely transparent so you can still see the address, and value of the destination in a transaction... and with that, you can then blacklist certain UTXOs.

When a channel on the Lightning Network closes, the final balances will be transacted on the Bitcoin blockchain, of which is, and always will be, transparent.

I didnt say anything had to be violent.  We, however, need massive, fundamental change. I think its completely doable too. People are waking up. Politicians will eventually too, because they want to continue to be elected. It's just happening at a snail's pace...

Except they dont care, and going to court takes money and time. I'd think a family that has to collects quarters for $500 isn't able to carry that extra weight easily. 
We need a massive revolution.

We replace cash bail... with nothing. I guarantee that the guy above did not return to court just so he could get his 500 back. He did it so he wouldn't get extra charges. Cash bail is a regressive cash grab.
And I agree with your point of body cams. I just said I'm not the "biggest fan".

The thread is obviously about this guy's experience with his local police department's lack of empathy. 
Criminal justice and local involvement is a big part of some 2020 candidates. We just have to make sure that something comes from it. 
For specifics of criminal justice reform,  we need to formally decriminalize victimless crimes and expunge those who have been found guilty. We also need to eliminate cash bail. Getting rid of cash bail by itself would be a massive win.
I'm not the biggest fan of body cameras since we already have a mass surveillance problem, but these are popular and I understand why.
