Scammers scamming scammers.

The man is right and those guys are probably pricks. Dont see nothing wrong with this post. All the rest are shillers who do not want these things written in the first page of the subreddit.
Sorry guyz :)

It is definitely MMM. Dunno why some seem so excited about people getting scammed.

they funded my account with 400 usd extra, then took it back in less than 1 hour.
too bad i was so late

I didn't use any bug.
They had a problem, and fixed it.
Didn't expect to get anything.
It was a joke, welcome to reddit.

This is exactly what bitcoin shillers won't say to you, this is bitcoins biggest lie.
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:25:02
would you please give some examples of bad translation?

I'm sorry, but i verified your statement, "Bitcoin is merely one among many ways to fund it", and i found it's not correct: you can only use btcs. Source: MMM support. I can provide screenshot.
