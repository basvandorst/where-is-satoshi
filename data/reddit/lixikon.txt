You can clearly see by the network's hashrate here  that the miners have almost completely left BCH a few hours ago and are mining BTC.
The reason is that BCH difficulty has jumped up a few hours ago, making it much less profitable to mine: 
When BCH emergency adjusts the difficulty down again, the miners will jump back to BCH and the BTC tx fees will rise again. Then after a while the BCH difficulty will jump up again. This back and forth will continue for quite a while.

Is mining the most profitable coin really gaming the system? I'd say it's the system that has a flaw instead, it is supposed to work with miners only having their profit in mind. This behavior was predicted even before the split.

The warnings about Tether have been going on for more than a year already and I'm really not sure how people can just blindly use it. Googling it or looking at the legal aspects on their website should be warning enough for anyone -- but apparently not.
Eventually many people will be in for a rude awakening, until then Tether just seems to continue rising in popularity which only makes the problem worse.

But in the time it takes to mine one BTC block they could've mined like five BCH blocks, you have to look at the thing not per block but also take the difficulty into account. Now that the BCH difficulty has adjusted upwards the whole equation has tipped again in favour of mining BTC.

GDAX is a real exchange, even with a very nice interface, you access it with your coinbase account as it's the exchange behind coinbase.
