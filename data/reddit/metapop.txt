XRP or Ripple is also distributed via BOINC and has a great exchange built in. Their wallet allows you to hold $, ¥, €, £, or just about any other currency simultaneously (including BTC, LTC and other cryptos), and it allows you to send funds to other accounts under 5 seconds- other transfers can take much longer.

In that case, I'll put my comment here- I'm liking the massive doji at support as well. Very strong candlestick corroborating your point.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:52:22
I think it'll land around 250-400. 750 by the end of the week, 2000 by spring.

I'm not saying it can happen now, I'm saying I believe they are working on a solution to be the bank. Obviously Coinbase (for example) has set up the pathways to directly debit &amp; deposit into a bank, but Ripple is still in beta and doesn't have this set up yet. To answer your question directly, this is how I personally do it (sans BofA, they're bastards).
All I'm saying is that based on the fact that they will have a reserve (unlike BTC) makes me think that it would make sense for them to utilize gateways for now, but as their reserve grows, I think it would behoove them to create a "bank", or perhaps an organization that is designed to be the ideal financial institution in the digital world. No need for tellers/branches/loan departments, but an exchange &amp; reserve for trading virtual currency. If gateways are a weakness (isn't that what this post is about?) then become a product that removes gateways entirely.

Completely true. Trusting your instincts is a lesson that has been reinforced with BTC. I burn myself *not* trusting my instincts than actually going for it.

...and it only takes a week for the purchase to take place. Big disappointment after buying 10BTC today, and them notifying me of that after the purchase was made.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:25:30
I have a few reasons why.
-Everyone says that the market cap is a big preventative factor with XRP, but I tend to disagree. Ripple is  in market cap value among other VCs (behind BTC) and only valued currently at around $.03. I don't think that ripple will every surpass $1000+; it doesn't need to. Value is arbitrary, it is all about relative value. I do think $1-2 is realistic by the end of 2014, which would comprise a 33+x increase. I bought in under a penny, fortunately.
-XRP was initially traded for 1000/$1, it's currently at 35/$1. That growth is only matched by BTC. I don't think the public (or more specifically China) is dissuaded by the fact that there are 100 billion XRP, in fact the fact that Ripple is holding half (? it has changed a few times) of it is slightly comforting, as the reserve helps steady the ship. It also provides incentive for Ripple Labs to encourage the value of XRP to go up, so my interests are aligned with theirs. 
-Ripple has guys that worked for Booz Allen, Goldman Sachs, World Bank, I mean, they hired very well connected individuals. Their founders established E-Loan &amp; Mt. Gox. They understand global banking &amp; payments, unlike every other VC on the planet. It is easy to track payments, making it appealing to governments for taxation &amp; regulation reasons.
-Ripple's interface is easy to use, and their IOU system is brilliantly designed. It allows for extremely fast payment &amp; more importantly, they establish themselves as the Rosetta Stone for currencies. That is a fucking big deal. Forex does trillions upon trillions of trades, and if they picked up on Ripple, it would be massive. Ripple charges .0001% per trade. Western Union &amp; Forex markets are squarely in their crosshairs. They need gateways, businesses, banks to participate in the system, which, is squeaky clean compared to BTC. If Ripple captures even 1% of these b2b markets, that is huge, and it will certainly have a large impact on the value of XRP.
I think Ripple has a brilliant business model, it is certainly not the scam it has been made out to be by others. It's not perfect, but when consolidation happens with BTC, so far I believe Ripple will be the next generation of cryptocurrency.

Congratulations. I'm jealous. I read about BTC several years ago, thought about buying $1000 worth, and didn't... I'd be a millionaire right now if I did. Been kicking myself since I read about BTC's success over the past month or so.
@_date: 2013-10-11 03:00:28
Given that Ripple has stated that they plan on having a reserve, that XRP will increase in value based on the amount of volume/users that utilize their services, I don't think it's inconceivable that they could act as a bank in this instance. I think that "gateways" are a temporary fix until they can have enough capital to BE the bank.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:19:34
The complication of accessibility was one of the things driving the price down in early years. If it's not easy, not everyone will do it, therefore eliminating some of the demand in the supply &amp; demand scale.
I learned about BTC just after the $30 crash (when it was $.05) and after learning I had to actually wire money overseas to get some, my response was "screw that". I was considering putting in $250. I regret this decision immensely.
Think of it like this; when people were heading out west in the early days of the US, there was risk involved with doing so, and prices for land were cheap, or free. The same was true with BTC in the early days. Now that it's a more civilized place, prices have gone up. The true will be with BTC when it is incorporated more and more into the social fabric of everyone's lives.

You might be right, but consider the historical aspect… When the first jump back in April happened, it started around 30 &amp; went to 266. This time around, it started around 120, and again, went about 10x. If history says anything about this, and if bitcoin drops fast enough, it might fly right past 500 and land about 50 to 75% higher than when it started, around 250 maybe 300 or so. We will see, there is a slight rally happening right now, but I believe this to be a classic bull trap.
@_date: 2013-10-21 07:11:49
I remember seeing posts in the past, one guy did a self post in I believe, he took 100k out of gold and put it in BTC. Based on the date posted, I believe BTC was around $15 at the time. I looked at his comment history, his last post was a loooooong time ago.

Ripple is a great solution. They just opensourced and I expect gateways for fiat will increase drastically.

30 x 9 is 270, roughly where the crash started in April. 30 is the beginning of the mountain.
133 x 9 is 1200, roughly where our recent peak is.
The first crash landed around 50-60 if I remember correctly.
The second crash may land around the same proportions. But... the Chinese weren't playing last round, and they're waking up now.

What do currencies generally open at after a crash like this? Specifically, what do you suppose BTC may sell for when markets do open back up?
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:27:04
Not exactly. I personally think that prices will fall eventually, back to under $100, possibly well under $100. Of course I could be wrong. I'd rather take the chance that it will fall and buy then as compared to wagering now and being disappointed. Best of luck to those of you that have loads of BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:20:48
Just did it, thanks. I'm not having any luck either.

Who defines what is "even" or "uneven"? This is a complicated way of saying "buy low sell high", but it's tough when there's nothing else to define what high or low are, aside from hindsight. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:50:34
I believe this to be a classic bull trap. OP is right, I think possibly even lower. Consider what happened in April, the surge started around 30 &amp; went nine times higher, and we are almost in the exact same circumstances now, The numbers are different, but the proportions are the same. If I remember correctly, April's crash landed around 50 to 75% higher than where it started, which puts us around 300 or so. We will see.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:42:57
I would suggest looking at Ripple. Payments is what they specialize in, and although it's a dirty word in they do payment arguably better than anyone else. They only charge .0001% too. You can send any currency you like, as long as there is a gateway for it.
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:21:35
I agree with you on all points. I will add a couple thoughts, though:
-You referred to people maturing in terms of their ability to hold. While this is true, there are new to join users all the time, and they may represent 30 to 50% of the entire bit coin market. This is enough to create at least a small pop if things were to collapse. Maybe long term users will hang on, we don't know.
-I believe the crash in April was a huge learning experience for many people, and this caused everyone that is serious about trading to establish a well thought out escape route for their money. This will only make the market more volatile in the event of a crash, in my opinion.
Bitcoin is impossible to legislate &amp; restrict, which means that it will be the Wild West for quite some time to come. I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing, I think it is an amazing exciting experiment, and in some respects I welcome the volatility.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:47:48
Is that the whole point? I suppose everyone has different values.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:27:52
Ripple. Haters gonna hate.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:31:17
Pardon me if this is a dumb question, but I would imagine this will slow down the supply, and with demand climbing, prices are sure to go up?
@_date: 2013-04-06 13:20:46
It would have to drop substantially for me to do that. Best times to buy is as an early adopter or after a bubble bursts.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:37:05
I personally believe (fully realizing the downvotes will prevent many of you from seeing this) that ultimately the crypto with the most state intervention and/or ability to monitor or regulate will be the most widely accepted. I think ultimately that currency will be XRP. That said, BTC is the Wild West. Lots and lots of fortunes were made in the Wild West. The trick is determining when the Wild West became Texas and anticipating what it takes to alter strategies to make the most out of the world changing around you.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:04:31
Bitstamp is the most notable, but cash for XRP doesn't give you a great rate. Peercover is another place. Assuming you hold BTC, trading it for XRP is very easy at ripple.com. Currently it's trading for 36k thereabouts for BTC, but a couple weeks ago it was around 90k, so it's experienced a higher rate of growth than even BTC, believe it or not.
XRP is distributed via giveaways, it isn't mined. That said, they had a giveaway over the past week that if you donate computer time to science, you were rewarded with XRP. I jumped on late &amp; didn't make much unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:49:12
How easy was it to mine for BTC in the early days? If you let your computer run all night, how many BTC would you expect to wake up to?
