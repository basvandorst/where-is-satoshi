Looks like Weiss have purchased a good amount of NEO and Cardano lol

Still faster than SWIFT
@_date: 2019-12-20 07:50:04
What banks even sell bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-20 07:48:40
All heaters should be crypto miners, however they are pricey and constantly need upgrading to adjust with the difficulty. Doubt they would be very profitable.

I wonder how many of these people are here from 2014 or even earlier? Pretty much everything i hold, even some shitcoins are still worth way more than i paid for them in 2014.
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:41:29
Completely agree, there is plenty of room for different blockchains. Ethereum offers smart contracts, NEM offers smart assets, Monero offers privacy, and so on, etc.

And M$ had no other option than to do so to ensure their survival
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:28:55
At this rate, $10K will easily happen this year
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:51:00
Couldnt say it better myself.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:43:55
Anyone placing shorts in the last couple of months was asking for trouble TBH.
In fact, leverage trading full stop is not what i recommend. HODL is the only way to go, might take longer to make gains, but much less risky.

Bitcoin futures was a real mess in 2017 though, i think that was one reason the price surged so much and then crashed in 2018
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:41:03
No wonder Bitcoin hit $8k today
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:36:25
ICO's yes i totally agree, but as far as blockchain applications, there are plenty. Yes BTC is a great store of value and does its job well, but for everyday payments and Point of sale etc, we need blockchains that are fast and scalable.
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:48:05
Thats a pretty good estimate. I think 10K is easily going to get broken this year the way the markets are reacting.
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:38:44
lol, yet so many still exist, just take a look at CMC. I think the cryptopia hack helped kill a few off though.
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:33:53
Well either way it looks like BTC will have no problem hitting $10K again this year.
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:36:29
we see this pattern happening more often
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:27:21
I remember them well.
All crypto veterans should all remember cryptsy, mintpal, mtgox, just to name a few lol
And what about peercoin, digitalcoin, quarkcoin, bitbar, Darkcoin(before it became DASH)? lol
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:48:43
lol Meme season is back again
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:06:53
Check the alts now, XEM is up about 11% and many other alts in the top 30 are anywhere in the green between 1-9%
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:04:15
lol this is clever
meme season back in full swing i see
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:03:08
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:05:41
thats so 2016 lol
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:32:44
Good luck with them trying, dont know how they plan on enforcing it though.
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:43:03
Wont be long before total crypto marketcap is more than microsoft
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:28:18
RAM is "memory" for sure, but i was talking about Storage space when i was referring to memory, for storing the blockchain data itself if these are expected to run a full node. Its already over 210 gigabytes in size.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:45:43
I think that whole bear market was driven by shorters, now the opposite is happening again.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:53:21
I think this could also be said about crypto as a whole too. Alt season looks like its just begun
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:47:58
He is probably the most famous anonymous person in mankind's history lol
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:25:39
Who even has been around that long to even remember MtGox? lol
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:50:16
So is that what these ultra-wide computer monitors were designed for? Brilliant!
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:39:37
Who remembers the bitcoin obituaries video on youtube?
Probably needs updating lol
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:40:59
Its gonna need alot of RAM and memory lol
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:40:01
Thats the one reason that NEM never forked after the coincheck hack, and never will fork to bend over for any exchange who gets hacked.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:51:44
I know somebody who bought 1000BTC when it was worth only 4c and sold them at $20 thinking he had done well :(
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:49:12
Thats a good exercise regime
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:46:37
Is that Kim Jong-un Jr?
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:40:04
Its more like a recovery since the price is still having to make its way back to its last ATH, then anything on top of that is a real bullrun
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:38:16
I honestly dont think we will ever see bitcoin below $2K ever again
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:34:39
meme season is always a good sign lol
