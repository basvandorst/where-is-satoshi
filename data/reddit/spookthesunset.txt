Since you will be offering these traded quasi-pink-sheet securities, will you be disclosing your financials?  Major investors?  Material events?  Can I expect to get mailed a 10-K every year?
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:43:39
Because it is damn close to a stock offering or a security.  Then they'd have to comply crazy nanny state regulations that would require them to open their books, issue press releases for every material event, and you know... all the other stuff publicly traded companies are forced at gunpoint to do.
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:45:38
Yeah, god forbid those statist jack booted thugs would force them at gunpoint to call a duck a duck.  
Bitfinex are offering stock in their company.  Period.  That is what they are doing.  Giving you a stock grant.  Therefore they need to do everything that is required of any other traded company.  Like open their books.  Issue press releases for material events.  Disclose major investors.  Otherwise, how the fuck would you know what you are now an investor in?

I sure hope you aren't going seek help from anybody paid with "public" money that was stolen from me by the government.  If you call the police or seek any retribution using the government, you are using my wealth to pay for your own mistakes and that is wrong.  If you or your company made a mistake, you need to own up to it and pay for it yourself.  Asking me, or anybody else here to pay for it is theft.
@_date: 2016-04-20 03:05:40


Those laws were created by people who stole money from me through taxes.  My money should not fund your mistakes.  If you made a mistake and go out of business as a result, it is your own doing.  To seek aid from the government to pay your boneheaded mistakes is theft Mr. Voorhees.  You talk the talk, Erik, it is time to walk the walk
@_date: 2016-04-20 04:38:09
I don't think I mis-understand you at all.  
Why are you citing legal code or asking for assistance from the government?  You are *stealing my money* the second you ask for government aid.   You should be demanding the government mind their own business and stay the fuck out of your private affairs. If the government spends a single dime on this private affair or God forbid detains this former employee against their will, you are a thief, Erik.

I certainly hope you plan to use a private courtroom paid for out of pocket for this, Mr. Voorhees.  The wealth that was robbed from me at gunpoint by government goons certainly shouldn't be used to pay for cases between two private parties.  How would you feel if the government forced you to pay for my own private court cases?

@_date: 2016-04-10 05:41:07


Be careful about the words you use.  This isn't theft.  Theft implies violence, say, you beat your wife for no reason. I don't see anybody physically hurt do you?  If you call it theft, it implies the government needs to control it and I don't know about you but the government has no business telling people how to code.
Our governments steal billions of dollars through tax theft and quite frankly if I'm gonna be forced at gunpoint to pay for goons, I'd rather those goons do something other than look at source code when I'm perfectly capable of determining if an application is legit or not myself.  Call it theft and it just gives those in power another reason to forcefully steal peoples hard earned wealth.

Averages hide the distribution of whatever they are measuring.  Even having the median credit card debt would help draw a picture of what is up.  There could be a relatively small set of people with a ton of debt and a large set of people with relatively little (or even no) debt.
Plus, a good bit of that "debt" could just be the statement balance for that month--one that the card holder intends to pay off on the due date.  After all, there is no incentive to pay earlier... interest doesn't start accumulating on new charges until after the due date...
Anway, that's all I got...

Thankfully, you can do just that shortly if you hold bitcoin.  Satoshi is going to be coming back any day now and will be taking bitcoin holders to his interstellar comet. On this comet, bitcoin holders will be able to purchase anything their hearts desire on the worlds most free, unregulated markets.  For example, unlike on earth, on Satoshi's comet you could buy pure nuclear grade uranium and use it to learn and experiment with chemistry and physics.   No jack booted thugs will shoot you at gunpoint for just trying to educate yourself.

That is the problem with bitcoin.  You need consensus to make any kind of meaningful change.  Worse, if you fail to get consensus to make that change, then you wind up with two separate incompatible forks of the blockchain and two separate "alt-coins".  Having your currency split into two is not really something that anybody would want--it would probably kill bitcoin.  So you are left with "do I make a change to bitcoin that requires a hardfork and risk destroying bitcoin" or "do I just stick with status quo, which kinda-sorta works and tough it out".    Worse, you need to convince 50% of all miners, who have a different set of incentives than the engineers and developers and worse, don't really understand software development much at all, to make this risky change.
What you are left with is bitcoin only changing when it is an "absolutely, 100% necessary or bitcoin will die in the next 2 days" kind of thing.  Any kind of proactive change or improvement will get kicked down the road to some far-off date.  Even if those improvements would have very clear benefits in the future (see the whole 3-line change to increase the block size as a perfect example).  Bitcoin is designed from the ground up to be change averse. That isn't a healthy way to run a software project.
Again, bitcoin is completely stillborn.  It was designed to be almost impossible to change.  People will simply replace bitcoin rather than improve it.
@_date: 2015-12-06 16:11:35


Without pooled mining, you would probably never get a reward for running a miner.  The odds of a single bitcoin miner getting the block reward are very, very, very low.
@_date: 2015-12-01 01:53:32
All the big names here have conflicts of interest.  Nobody discloses any of that shit.  Eg:  Erik Voorhees owns a shit-ton of bitcoin ([see here]( and stands to gain millions  and he gives financial advice al the time and discloses nothing.  Same with Roger Ver.  Same with that Andreas Anatopolies guy.  All the people at the top are like that...
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:44:16
If it involves getting consensus from 50% of all miners or risk splitting the currency into two separate forks, it ain't gonna happen.  
This block size thing is like 3 lines of code.  It is a technical/engineering issue turned into a political one.  If you cannot push out a 3 line code change, any kind of change will be impossible.  Especially any kind of risky change that needs to be done in a hurry.
My point is, Bitcoin is impossible to change in any meaningful way—this was done by design. It is completely stillborn.  
@_date: 2015-12-02 05:24:30


No you don't.  You only have true control when you hold the keys.  If somebody else holds the keys, they are in control.  The whole point of bitcoin is that unlike any time in history, you are in complete control over your wealth.  
By handing your bitcoin over to coinbase or some intermediary, you are letting them have control.  They become your bank and can do anything they want.  How can you trust them any more than you trust the federal reserve bank?

I can't trust giving my key over to anybody.  With bitcoin I am in complete control of my own wealth.  No way do I trust somebody to engrave my "encrypted" secret key.
@_date: 2015-06-03 06:32:31
Worse, the protocol itself makes Bitcoin almost impossible to change.   When every change needs to have more than 50% acceptance by miners or suffer a hard fork of the blockchain (screwing everybody), it makes it very, virtually impossible to change anything.
Oddly enough this is one of the main reasons the federal reserve isolates itself from the normal political realm.  If it took a literal act of congress to make any change to the monetary policy, you could be sure the fed could never react fast enough to a crisis. Worse, every "technical" issue with monetary policy would turn into a political issue when it should be left to the "engineers" to deal with.  When politicians get involved in engineering, nothing good happens.
That is what is happening with Bitcoin.  By having that consensus mechanism, all technical issues suddenly become political issues.  Which means change happens very slowly, if at all.

Linus didn't have to get the consensus of every non-technical  person using Linux to make any minor change to the OS.  Non-engineers don't  give a fuck about most of the changes he makes as long as they don't break anything.  That is how it should be.  You trust your engineers to do the right thing.
Bitcoin forces every single little minor change to be subject to review of every miner using it. Miners are generally not developers and generally don't understand the technical issues yet they all have to agree to every technical  change or the blockchain forks and everybody loses.  Thus even a technical, purely engineering decision about scalability and block sizes turns into a huge toxic political fight.
Linus would have just made the change, rolled it out, and nobody would have noticed or cared beyond the fact that his change made things better in the long run.  Bitcoin can't have that because any change requires everybody to get on board, which turns every engineering decision into a political decision. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 20:12:34
But in order for a decentralized system to be successful (i.e. better than what we have now), somebody will have to invent a set of rules that get baked into the protocol.

Well, not exactly.  Isn't there a fee given to miners to process the transfer of bitcoin from one address to another?  And even though that fee is technically optional, isn't it true that if you don't pay it you can expect to pretty much not have your transaction processed in this century?

In general, they give you that notice because they think the check you just deposited might not clear, or some other thing about your account makes the bank nervous.  They don't want you to deposit a $12k check, have that check not clear at the other end, and have you walk away with $12k.
What you do is call the bank and see if they can make it go through on your end faster.  Remember that the bank is basically loaning you the money until the underlying transaction goes through.
In the future, try to make large transfers like that using ACH or even a wire transfer and you'll have less trouble.  Better still, go join a credit union.  Credit unions tend to not dick you around as much about this sort of thing.

And by profiting off the testing, they had no incentive to make the testing more efficient.  Basically, using the real bitcoin network for testing incentivized the company to take their sweet time shipping the product.  It was a corrupting force on the company--there was no reason to ship early as they made money off the units.  
Worse, they were doing exactly what everybody suspected they were doing--sitting on the hardware and using it to mine for bitcoin.  Had they been upfront and transparent about testing on the production network they would have been ethically in the clear (though they may have had quite a few less customers...)

Fast transactions, yes.  Confirmations of those transactions?  Not so much.


They aren't optional if you want them confirmed any time this century.  Witness the video of people withdrawing money from the atm.


Most people don't want that stuff under their control.  People are getting their bitcoin jacked all the time because they don't know how to secure their money.

The whole "people are getting paid to post bad things about bitcoin" argument is a pretty bad line of reasoning if you think about it.
What is the incentive to post paid trolls on this forum?  Probably not much.  Think about how many meetings the NSA would have to have to get a budget item to "post bad shit about bitcoin on some forum called reddit".  How would somebody in a conservative bank get a budget to "post bad shit about bitcoin"?  Think of the red tape!  
Wouldn't the real money be in posting constant "good news" to hype up bitcoin and cash in?  There is a pretty strong incentive to do exactly that.  The best part is the incentive is really strong if you are small-time.  If you are some small "bitcoin investment fund" started out of your frathouse, you damn right you are gonna sit around and hype (er, "market") bitcoin on forums all day.  If you were some exchange or somebody with a vested interest in bitcoins success, you damn right there is a strong incentive to hype up bitcoin.
Seriously, the logic behind "paid anti-bitcoin shills" is pretty crap if you look at where the incentives lie.  There is a strong incentive to shill bitcoin, not the other way around.  Hell, if I was gonna be a paid shill, I sure know which end of the stick I was gonna be on...

God forbid somebody demonstrate there is very little that is unique or special about bitcoin.  Face it buddy, bitcoin is one cryptocoin in an ocean whose size is virtually unlimited.

Once the clueless grandmas, students, and other disenfranchised "bitcoin investors" catch on that anybody with a text editor and GCC can create their own cryptocurrency... it is dump-city and your scam will dry up.  The only reason businesses "adopt" bitcoin is because there are a lot of "rich" early adopters who need to cash out their pre-bubble earnings without tipping off the IRS.  Thanks to coinbase, they can milk these folks dry with very little risk.

Except the economy is *not* finite.  It is (almost) always growing--meaning the total *economic value* of everything created gets bigger and bigger.  You've got problems unless the supply of money grows at the same rate.  If the supply doesn't grows slower than the economy, not enough money is chasing around all those cool awesome new things.  Then  you've got deflation... and deflation isn't a good thing at all for reasons I'm not getting into here--take a basic macro economics class for more on that.
So your hypothetical, super-awesome bitcoin system would suffer massive deflation because it wouldn't be able to grow with the economy.  As a result, people would stop buying as much new awesome things and worse, people would stop investing in the creation of new awesome things (because why bother when you could just hold bitcoin and get a good return?).  The economy would go to the shitter...  the end.

Do you understand how A/B testing works?  They serve a fraction of the traffic to that page a variant that has the bitcoin link and the remainder the original page.  Nothing else about the page will have changed.
Same source of traffic, same flow.  The only difference between the two groups is the bitcoin link.  Because we know this is the only difference, we can statistically say that the traffic that got the bitcoin link were 7.5% less likely to donate than those that did not get the link.
What is not present on that chart is fun things like the P value, which is the probability of obtaining the results of the sample.  My guess is the P-Value is at least 95%, which states that 95% of the time a different sample of the same group will have the same 7.5% decline in donations.
This is all basic freshman level statistics.  Same statistical methods used for polling, same methods used to find out how likely the wings will fall off a 747, same methods used to figure out how long you'll wait in line at a Wendy's.

It's called elastic beanstalk.  You upload a zip file containing the shit to deploy, tell it how many instances you want it to scale up to, and some other variables, and call it a day.

The company I work for runs it's entire platform on EB hosted docker instances.  You only get one listening port per container (an eb imposed limit), which is kind of a drag--they really want you to use their queue service for inner-container communication (or go with their opsworks or whatever the next level of complexity is).  I chose EB because I wanted something that was easy enough for devs to tinker with if needed...  it is easier for them to click around a webpage than it is to learn chef or puppet.
We have about 35 instances of mixed flavor and so far I haven't seen a monthly bill go over $3k--I think we average around  $1k-$2k (haven't really checked the bill)  A bit of that bill is storage &amp; bandwidth though.  More than half of those instances are 1-year reserved instances...


Docker made a lot of that easier for us.  The biggest problem that we had to solve ourselves was the building out docker images and pushing them off to that docker repo thing.
In short, so far, so good.  It isn't perfect, but honestly it beats maintaining the VM's themselves through a pile of puppet scripts that only one person in the company is willing to touch.  When I inherited the system... the previous person had all the instances set up through a pile of bash scripts--every instance was a work-of-art.  
EB is less intimidating to the developers and they are more willing to go in and fix/improve things themselves.  I'm pretty pro-AWS in general for all but the largest of companies.  The last place I worked at had their own hardware in a datacenter.  Looking back, it seemed like we spent a lot of time maintaining that hardware when we could have been doing something more productive (say working on something that actually improves the customer experience of the product).  Plus we had multi-year contracts, multi-year equipment leases, etc... lots of stuff that really kept us from scaling (or de-scaling) on demand.  Maintaining physical infrastructure really isn't a core part of most companies.  
I'd like to play around with AWS's container service.... it does away with the notion of running on an EC2 instance alltogether and I guess is closer to heroku.
Sorry if this is a ramble....  have to go do other things :-)

Ignore the people telling you to hold.  Consider that $3k in losses counts as a deduction and not a credit.  Your $3k loss amounts to about $540 to like $750 in actual tax savings depending on your average tax rate (I guessed 18% to 25%)
Also consider the fact you can carry losses &gt; $3k forward to future years.  If you think bitcoin is gonna go down more, you are *way* better off cashing it all out now and carrying your losses forward year after year.
Rather than read about it on a forum full of incredibly biased people giving you terrible financial advice, you would do well to visit this:

On Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, private parties sue each other in private Truly Free Market Courtrooms all the time. On the comet you can pay for whatever fully unregulated courtroom Bitcoin can buy.  If you wanted to pay for a Courtroom set in a lovely forest with waterfalls and birds, you can do that.  If you wanted to pay for a courtroom that overlooks the vast city of New Satoshi from 70 stories up, you can do that too.  No statist will force you at gunpoint to use a illegally funded state owned courtroom.
Obviously not every person can afford such lavish accommodations for their unregulated free market trial.  No problem.  Those without means will obviously be able to rely on charity courtrooms.  For example there might be unregulated free market religious institutions like the Church of Scientology, or perhaps the Church of Saint GNU who would be willing to host your trial using their judges and unregulated free market laws.  
Perhaps the defendant's friends could pitch in and rent space at a local unregulated food emporium basement.  If the defendant has nobody to reach out too, they could see if a wealthy business tycoon would be willing to lend them money to pay for their trial.  If that all fails,  maybe it was your fault in the first place—perhaps you simply are not smart enough to survive without a nanny state to leech from. 
I know for a fact that you, Mr Voorhees, own a huge amount of bitcoin and will definitely be seated directly next to Satoshi.  For everybody else, I recommend you buy &amp; hold.  Someday very soon, Satoshi will return and take all Bitcoin holders to his Interstellar Comet.  Only those who hold the One True Bitcoin will be allowed.

It isn't robbing.  Brewster didn't physically steal anything.  Money and bitcoin are just ephemeral pulses of energy or light that aren't real.   Brewster was simply controlling bits that were delivered to his own computer and modified them to his liking. 
It is like people claiming that torrenting movies or music is theft.  Digital stuff *wants* to be copied.  It *wants* to be modified.  These things are easy to do and impossible to stop. People need to learn to stop ascribing value to ephemeral things like digital music, video or even bitcoin.  It isn't Brewsters fault that people ascribed value to the digital information he modified in order to control.  That is like saying hackers should be locked in cages because they are smart and like to learn about network security.
Think about it.  Right now you clicked some link to get here to read this.  That was a series of instructions you gave to your computer, which performed those instructions and changed the state of data stored on your machine and remotely.  That is all Danny did.  He clicked links, his computer performed various instructions on the data it was given.  How is this illegal?  If the government made what Danny did illegal, it is slippery slope to making computers performing any non government approved action illegal.  Think about it.

So it is a successful business than?  His whole business model was to take investor money and run.  I personally think this kind of thing can be prevented not with more nanny state regulation but something like OpenBazaar.  Blockchain based distributed systems like that have decentralized reputation systems that are mathematically impossible to falsify.  If you have a bad reputation on a OpenBazaar, you are done for.  If investor money was given to him on OpenBazaar through a bitcoin escrow service none of this would have happened.  Danny wouldn't have risked his reputation because it would mean he would never be able to start another business and the escrow service would have meant everybody got their bitcoin back.  All Jonny Law will do is lock up Brewster like they locked up Ross.  Both didn't actually physically hurt anybody and on the whole both contributed more to the world than they harmed it.

What problem, exactly, does having a dead man's switch be "trustless" solve?  And even if it did solve a problem, is it really the important problem to solve?  I mean, getting it transferred to them seems like the easy part.  The hard part, in my mind is what happens then.  Do they liquidate it?  If so, do they know how?  Are they expected to hold it?  If so, do they know how to secure Bitcoin?  How to deal with its volatility?  How to know when / if they should sell it?  How about if they too kick the bucket?  Who gets the stash then?

Fuck off you salty no-coin asshole.  The chart in this post is backed by mathematical equations that are taught to any beginner trader.  Even a child with basic TA knowledge can see the Langdoñ-Higgs intercept the 2nd derivative of the market saturation line.  This means sentiment is gonna shift bullish.  Wallstreet is waiting on the sidelines to jump in and this is their chance.  Expect the price to 10x virtually overnight.  This will conclude with a new ATH of at least $3 million by the end of April.

So your proposal is to commit a worse crime, theft at gunpoint, in order for a nanny state government to punish some smart individual who was able to transfer non-physical wealth to their possession?  Keep in mind the OP voluntarily clicked on the order link.  He gave his consent to have his bitcoin irreversibly taken from him.  Even without consent, there was no physical harm, which makes this case yet another victimless crime--the same kind of "crime" that Ross Ulbricht is forcefully locked in a cage for.
A "crime" is when somebody is physically harmed without consent.  For example if a husband were to beat his wife with a lead pipe for no reason and without prior authorization.  And even then, despite the horrific nature of the event, such a case should be tried in a private natural law courtroom of both's choosing.  
Your proposal is sickening.  You want to label all non-violent, victimless crimes as something deserving of punishment and worse you want to steal from millions of people using force in order to pay for it.

If he has a problem with the vendor, he should bring up a private lawsuit as opposed to using coercive government intervention and regulation in which people who haven't hurt anyone are harmed themselves, stolen from, and impeded from their peaceful, productive, and honest activities.
A private lawsuit doesn't require government intervention (just as food labeling, building codes, or meat packing require no government involvement).  People who don't understand the emergent order of chaotic systems fail to understand free markets and falsely hold hope that the government is the true salvation.   
Only the truly free market can resolve OP's predicament.  The free market allowed him to transfer wealth into the hands of a new owner who thanks to trustless decentralized protocols can prove with mathematical certainty that they have every conciable right to hold that wealth.  After all, whoever holds the private key owns the bitcoin.
A free market private lawsuit will allow both him and the new owners of the bitcoins he transferred to work together to resolve their differences.  However, given the absolute fact the new owners possess the bitcoin, there is very little that can or should be done.

Those government goons are paid for by taxes.  Tax is theft because if you don't pay, thugs will visit you and force you to pay at gunpoint.

How is the federal government acting on a contract you yourself agreed upon "sick"?  You signed the dotted line and you took the money.  
A loan is a business arrangement between two parties and you are free to stop payment at any time.  Just don't be surprised when the other party upholds their end of the business arrangement and starts taking shit away as a consequence.

On Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, no government thugs can force a loan agency at gunpoint to prohibit "creative" loan arrangements.  For example, rather than the loan collector taking your 92" flat screen TV and your unregulated free market collection of fully automatic assault rifles (mainly used for self defense), you can sign an agreement that let them chop off a finger or take a loved one instead.  There is nothing wrong with signing away your newborn into a 30 year stint working for the loan collectors uncle instead of paying off your loan.  Many loan collectors simply program the clause "collect by any means necessary" into the smart contract you digitally sign.
Since Satoshi's Interstellar Comet has no nanny state babysitting you every step of the way, it is in your rational self interest to read over any smart contract before signing it with your private key. I like to go down to the loan agency's office and talk with the developers and shake hands with the owner.  Once I am confident in the agency and its devs, I will hand disassemble the code and do a formal verification just to make sure everything will execute properly.
Because of the fact Satoshi's Interstellar Comet is one of the freest free markets on the universe, the capital markets run big and deep.  If you need a loan to start a 25i-NBOMe lab, you can get one in about 1 hour.  If you need a boat at 2am to go out and dumb a body in a river, you can get one.  If your child wants to attend a unregulated free market education institution and you didn't come to the comet with enough bitcoin, you can be rest assured that you will get a loan for whatever amount you want.
So please, take this 1 satoshi and use it as boarding pass to get on Satoshi's Space Ship.  Right now he is cruising back through hyperspace and will be here days before the global financial collapse.  Simply hand him your paper wallet and he'll wait for 6 confirmations.  Once aboard, help yourself to sushi served on naked women and enjoy some unregulated free market ecstasy and champagne.  Soon you'll be walking out the spaceship door into a new life.

The super wealthy don't invest in bitcoin because they don't want it to succeed.  They know that bitcoin is impossible to manipulate because it has a mathematically finite supply.  It is fungible and they cannot control how you use it.  They know bitcoin is trustless and decentralized.  What the wealthy cannot control, they use their power to destroy.  Which is why you see so many people on this sub making anti-bitcoin comments.  They hope to drown this place in a sea of fear, uncertainty and doubt.  They want you to give in.   To sell.  To make bitcoin fail.
The super wealthy own the banking cartel.  That is how they created their wealth in the first place--out of thin air.  The super wealthy use their power and status to bribe the highly unconstitutional federal reserve into hyperinflating the petrodollar to fund their never ending wars.  They use their money to spray us with chemicals, poison our water, and inject our children with drugs known to alter the mind.  It is all about compliance and mass control.  Fuck them.  Don't use their shitty currency.   Bitcoin is better in every single way imaginable!

That doesn't make a difference.  Either way affects the price.  If it was sold OTC it would be sold at a discount to a buyer that would immediately arbitrage away the price difference on the open market.  Plus, selling it on the OTC takes the volume away from the open market--a person buying OTC would have just used the open market if the OTC didn't exist.
OTC is not a magical place where you can go to liquidate large quantities of Bitcoin without affecting price.  It affects the price just like open market transactions...

If you were running something that was very chargeback prone, you could do that, yes.  But then why would a merchant ever want to deal with bitcoin when it will make them less money than just accepting credit cards only?
@_date: 2015-03-11 01:22:19


So the best way to change bitcoin is to not change bitcoin and route around it?


All changes to bitcoin are controversial, which is why bitcoin hasn't changed much at all.

Do not use Satoshi's name in vain or you'll get shit seats on his Space Ship.  You do realize that mastermind is telling us to start packing our bags because he knows the secret--Satoshi is coming back for bitcoin holders.  He will take them for away to a free market paradise on a lovely interstellar comet.
This comet, Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, is the most truly free market capitalist society the universe has seen.  Every street vender sells every type of victimless hallucinogen imaginable.  Doesn't matter if you are age 70 or 10, if you have the bitcoin, you can buy the goods.  After all, it is in the rational self-interests of children to experiment on 25c-NBOMe while they are young and their minds are plastic enough to understand the cosmic forces that underly the universe.  If the child should overdose or suffer permanent brain damage from the drug, it was their own fault--there is ample documentation on how to consume 25c-NBOMe and they failed to read it.  If the drug was impure, they should have paid more attention to the vendors reputation score on the blockchain.
This paradise of free markets is available to only those who possess private keys that unlock wealth on the blockchain.  When Satoshi arrives on his space ship, he will scan every holders wallet and wait 6 confirmations.  Should those confirmations go through, his scanner will beep an you will be allowed to board.  I'm sure you are buying and holding a shitton of cheap coins right now, but just in case, here is 1 satoshi Use it as your boarding pass so you can keep the remainder of your massive BTC stockpile to yourself.
Satoshi Speed good sir!!

It is pretty straightforward stuff if you start to research what our so-called "government" is really made of.
For one, banks get their powers from a fictitious system of governance that exists only because of illegally passed constitutional amendments.  For two, banks create new money with a press of a button and as such they are directly responsible for pushing the USD to the state where it is at now--imminent hyperinflation followed by a massive global economic collapse.  For three, banks own your wealth when you give them deposits and sell it back when you withdraw--this is a very big crime that the media tries very hard to cover up.
Your person can protect themselves from these evil corporations by simply converting their illegal funny money into mathematical trustless Bitcoin.  Satoshi has frequently mentioned how important it is to store your wealth in bitcoin as honestly it is just about the only way to be saved and protected from the future collapse of earth's fraudulent financial system.  He has mentioned there are big plans in the future for people who have private keys that unlock bitcoin wealth.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:02:52
Satoshi is currently on his way in a space ship to rescue all true bitcoin believers and take them to his interstellar comet.  Once on the comet, all bitcoin holders will be able to purchase goods and services on the galaxy's most free market ever.
You must always hold your bitcoin while here on earth because it will be worth orders of magnitude more on the comet.  In addition, the more bitcoin you hold, the closer you will sit next to Satoshi while on his space ship.
Here is a token that you can use as a boarding pass.
Stay safe my friend. Satoshi loves us all and will return to rescue us.

I'm telling you it doesn't matter if the project was public or private.  It doesn't matter how the project came into being, who is paying for it, or who is building it .  Any large scale project of any meaning would be impossible without some form of eminent domain.  Without some way to forcefully claim an individual's property it would be impossible to economically build pipelines, power lines, power plants, sewer treatment plants, roads, dams, canals, trains, or anything of the sort.  Doesn't matter who builds the project be it the government, Costco or some privately held wealthy individual.  Without eminent domain you would not have any mass infrastructure.
**edit** and sure you can say "build using another route" but most of the time that might not be economically feasible.  Think urban transit systems or any other kind of infrastructure that winds around some densely populated area.  Plus what if your "rich dude" is actually the one buying up land in all the good spots to block progress?  Now you've got the rich dude blocking progress on a project that benefits many people.
And I'm typing this on a phone so screw perfect spelling and grammar.

No offense buddy, but do you even know what the fuck you are talking about?  You clearly don't.
2.9% is the very high end of credit card merchant fees--unless you are in the porn business, or some other high-risk industry (porn can go up to like 25%).  The reason it is so high on square is because they charge a flat rate and because square is so damn easy to use and integrate.  If you don't know what I mean by "flat rate" you clearly really don't know shit about merchant accounts.  A real merchant account charges all kinds of different rates depending on the card (corporate mastercard vs credit union issued personal debit card, for example)--those rates are almost directly correlated to the risk of fraudulent transactions.  
In almost none of those cases is the transaction fee over like 2.5%.  When I had a merchant account, my rates were anywhere from $0.10 + 1.8% to $0.15 + 2.1% depending on the card.  And that is for AVS positive, online "card not present".  It would be less for "card present" and more if the customer didn't also have a full address match (which I would just outright reject, fuck dudes who didn't provide a proper address...).
Your mega-mart grocery store is probably paying at most 25 cents for a debit card transaction of any amount.  It probably pays 1% for a credit card transaction.  Amazon probably pays 1%...
Are merchant fees confusing?  Yes.  That is why square does it flat rate.  That is also why square charges what they charge.  Square also doesn't charge a flat rate + percentage (eg: $0.09 + 1.2%) like most merchant accounts--another reason their rates seems higher at first glance.
So yeah.  Learn what the fuck you are talking about before spouting nonsense.
@_date: 2015-03-03 05:31:25
Whatever buddy.  You keep living the dream.
Here.  This should compensate you for your time.  Make sure to hold it because when Satoshi comes and saves you and your buddies and takes you on his spaceship to his secret free market interstellar comet, you'll now have a first class seat right next to the glorious leader himself.  Make sure to save a couple satoshi's for when you get to the comet though, the bartenders in the free-market lounge all want tips.

Satoshi spoke with me in a dream last night my child.  He says that you will be saved when he returns and rescues all of his Free Men of the Land and delivers them to his interstellar comet where they will feast upon the delights only true mathmaticaly proven wealth can provide.  
While I know you must have a vast amount of wealth stored on the Blockchain, I must give you this additional Satoshi as a token to board his mighty space ship when it arrives.  Hold on to it and make sure to never sell your bitcoin no matter how urgent the moment may seem.  As foretold in Satoshi's great Whitepaper, the time when all free men on the land use Bitcoin is coming nearer by the day.  Buy and hold my friend.  Buy and hold.

That is okay though.  Satoshi has great plans for you.  Soon he will be returning to Earth in his space shuttle to rescue bitcoin holders and take them to his interstellar comet.  Since you are a bitcoin holder of significant future blockchain-based wealth, you will have good seating on the space ship and will have plenty of money to purchase goods and services while on the comet.
Satoshi's comet will have one of the galaxy's freest Free Markets anywhere.  It will sell hookers, 95% grain alcohol, bottled water, unregulated pharmaceuticals, [2C-E](  and so much more.  Read Satoshi's White Paper and you'll find more details.  He pretty much lays out the whole plan if you read between the lines.
Make sure to continue buying and holding.  Encourage your family and anybody else you know and care about to do the same.  If you don't they won't be saved when fiat collapses.

Why would you want this?  Maybe there is is some exception to the transaction that wasn't programmed into the "smart" contract?
In order for smart contracts to be successful, they'd have to cover every single conceivable exception in every transaction.  And trust me, there is a virtually unlimited number of exceptions to every transaction.  That is why courts, lawyers and our legal system exists.  Because the world isn't black and white and cannot be baked into code.

Merchant services are a pretty competitive industry so if somebody is charging upwards of 3-5% per transaction either homeboy must be selling to people who are completely clueless, or he is doing something extra that most merchant services don't do.

Hello there,
We have to work harder to gain bitcoin acceptance--there is no time to sit around and passively wait for people to come around.  
Very soon the fed will be exposed for the corrupt system that it is and fiat banking will collapse. Virtually overnight the economy of most first worlds will collapse.  Satoshi foresaw this chain of events and invented the blockchain as a way to save our economy.
Many may not realize this, but Satoshi has been hanging low on purpose.  If you examine the posts he wrote on bitcointalk before he went dark and truly read between the lines, it is very clear he has been building something very exciting that will help rescue those with enough smarts from this catastrophic banking collapse.
The catch is, if you really think critically about his writings, it is very clear that what he is working on will *only* be offered to people holding bitcoin before the collapse.  Those who are not holding bitcoin at the time of the collapse will have no way to regain their wealth and will be basically forced to beg.
I cannot go into much more detail about what he is working on as many would disbelive.  Needless to say, bitcoinholders such as those on will be able to function in the most revolutionary free market ever created.  They will be able to do things that most humans could only have dreamed of and will be able to do it far, far away from the prying eyes of the collapsing US corporate government.
Because I truly care about you and your loved ones, here is a token of my appreciation.

credit card fees are not 3%.  They are closer to 1.5% -&gt; 2% (for example chase claims 1.65% + $0.25):
I dunno where you people get the idea that people are paying 3-5% for merchant fees.  Only super-high risk industries pay that much...
