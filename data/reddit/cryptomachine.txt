The Embassy in Montreal was indeed the first. Tel-Aviv came later.

Since the inception of the Bitcoin Embassy, we explained Bitcoin to thousands of people, organized and hosted dozens of events on Bitcoin and related technologies, like Bitshares, MaidSafe, Ethereum, and so on.
In addition, the building houses several entrepreneurs and early-stage Bitcoin startups.
Finally, we gave countless interviews to the media, spoke at several conferences and events (Bitcoin-related or not), made presentations to the Senate, major banks and top-tier accounting firms here in Canada.
For more information, please check the portfolio that has been linked in the comments.

The way I see it, being Libertarian or Ancap is being anti-political. I think the idea of politics itself is rooted in statism, and as such, that liberty cannot be achieved through politics (see counter-economics). To this regard, asking for Bitcoin to become “neutral” and to deny its anti-political nature is an attempt to involve politics into Bitcoin, to change its anti-political nature to a political one. Despite the noble goals you name, the fact is, at this point, Bitcoin is somewhat of an elitist thing for tech-inclined people. Bitcoin is not for anyone or everyone. My mother can’t use Bitcoin. Realistically, most people can’t handle being responsible for their coins without some third-party trust outsourcing. It’s also untrue that nobody controls Bitcoin. Miners and developers have significant more control over Bitcoin than your average SilkRoad user. They just tend to “collude for the long term good of the network” for now, but they could easily become corrupt. Despite the drawbacks, Bitcoin is better than the alternative (fiat) by an order of magnitude. But trying to hide the facts about Bitcoin, its historical and philosophical roots is an act of politics. So is trying to manipulate people into adopting something without understanding its nature and deep purposes. Bitcoin is not a political statement, it’s a statement AGAINST politics. I don’t need a politically correct Buttlickingcoin, I need sound money. It’s all about Bitcoin changing the world, not the other way around.
