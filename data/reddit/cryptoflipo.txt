I did not realize Bitcoin was down. Up almost 100% in 1 year, over 1000% in 2 years... Smhh, expectations...

Lots of searches now shows outdated processes which does NOT work.
I was able to download Electrum, bitpay address works, simply right click in invoice details which populates and click details.
Unfortunately the address that shows is in image form and must be manually typed.  But it works!

By 2025, Bitcoin will be too Blockchain as 1952 Mickey Mantle is too baseball cards.

Don't forget,  getting cash out of thousands of ATMs around the world, transfer to cash using shift card, bitpay, etc. 
Bitcoin does not have to be exchanged when traveling globally.

Cold storage can also be a peice of paper. And as stated, "in my opinion" it's a toy. I prefer a brain wallet and core UI's. Hype, yes, it's exactly that. Looks like we mostly agree, except for the hype part :) Fact also, many people don't know anything about crypto, do or will lose it even with a "hardware wallet"

You don't move Crypto from a Ledger to a Trezor or to any device for that matter. Bitcoin stays on the blockchain, Ledger and Trezor both uses 24 word seeds which is determanistic of millions of addresses and potentially unlimited coin types.
For this reason, Ledger and Trezor is more of a toy than anything (my opinion).  Unless you like to carry a laptop around all the time.  Coinomi is actually capable of more than Ledger.  Also a core wallet is the only UI that gives full control of your coins.

That's what many investors now believe, which very well may be a great time to buy.
