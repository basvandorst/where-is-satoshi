I'm sure I can remote the fans in the bios. Hope that will help keep my gpu cool.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:03:29
Yes I know the option to send but the wallet I'm gonna try to send from is empty because the address to the btc wallet is different from the one I mine from nicehash to aka the address containing my money
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:57:52
I'll try to flip the gpu thx. And no I haven't touched the case fans at all but I do control my gpu fans. I guess I really should buy new fans..
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:45:42
Which one do you recommend? I recently switched to equihash and I get around 438 Henry /s. Is that good?
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:11:08
Thing is. All I have is an address that my Bitcoins is stored in. I don't have a wallet containing the bitcoin. ONLY an address. And I want that address into a wallet where i can store my bitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:26:10
I still use a 50$ chassi with 1 in and 1 out fan. should i buy more and better fans? And is this short term dangerous for my gpu? The chassi i Think is called deepcool tesseract (its kinda bad but my budget didnt allow me more xd)

Could you like voice call me on Skype and guide me I'm really the worst at understanding?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:26:04
I really do not know how to do. I have an old address with my Bitcoins but that address isn't bound to a wallet and I do not know how to bind an old address with a wallet. Every time I create a new wallet I get a new address and I can't change the wallet address
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:12:58
You see, i have an adress that i mine too using nicehash. But i cant pay with the old address. I want to transfer coins from my old address to a new one.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:58:05
See i use nicehash to mine right. THE ADDRESS I'M MINING TO ISN'T BOUND TO A WALLET. The address Nicehash mines to, I want to bind that address to a wallet that I can pay with..
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:48:33
I fixed the blackscreening. I guess i pushed my card abit to hard
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:44:01
I'll make a more explaining answer; I have 1 address with an amount of bitcoins, and then I have a coinbase wallet, but the addresses of the coinbase wallet and the address my Bitcoins are saved in is different. What I want Is a wallet with the same address as the address i have my Bitcoins in
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:23:59
Well, i dont know how to do that. I use coinbase. And btw I suppose that you mean exporting and importing the address.?
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:00:27
Nah I not through a normal Skype call but I respect ur decision. But maybe you could give me a little more detailed guide? Would be really nice of you, if you have the time ofc :)
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:03:06
What is an alt hahaha?? I am very new
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:48:15
I don't have a clue how to do it. Could you voice call me on Skype and guide me. That would be really appreciated :)
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:42:38
I use thundermaster instead it comes with all palit cards
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:05:18
I don't have the TI version but I guess it's kinda the same.. what happens at 94 degrees hehe..
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:44:48
No I first created a coinbase account. Then I used the address coinbase gave me to my wallet
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:35:04
I don't know at all. I watched a YouTube guide this one; 
You might wanna watch it to see what I did, I just followed the steps..
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:04:34
Once i set the fans at full load it immediately goes really high rpm then goes down again to very quiet
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:01:10
I dont pay the bill bro im 17 but i feel like i should get more than 5$ in 24 hours with a 1070 and a 6600k. Or i might be wrong
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:59:04
I guess I don't have one really. I just use nicehash to mine Bitcoins into a specific address.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:56:13
I have 1 address containing coins and the current address with no coins. I want the coins in my new address or my coinbase wallet
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:55:13
Well I think the coinbase wallet can only have 1 address. The address my coins are stored is in the coinbase "address history" I just want that old address bound to my wallet. I want to replace the current address that contains no coins replaced with the old address containing my coins, if that's possible..
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:50:52
i want to import my old wallet key into a new wallet
@_date: 2018-01-30 06:15:35
Yes I followed all the steps
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:04:59
I'm using nice hash miner. Idk what I'm mining
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:50:26
I dont have any watercooler for neither my gpu or cpu, that would be overkill. But will this short term damage my gpu having it at 70C?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:45:37
I got the address through my Coinbase wallet. But coinbase changes address like all the time
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:21:15
I guess mining when I'm in school is a pretty good option.. and when I'm asleep since my fan duty for some reason isn't running too high (my gpu constantly at 70 degrees so it's ok) so it won't annoy me. I guess that's a pretty good schedule..?
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:52:20
Im using a software called NiceHash miner. I dont know if thats Bitcoin or alt? How do i mine alts?
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:07:10
No I don't. All I have is an address containing Bitcoins that is now bound to nicehash. That address is all I have and I can't use it in a wallet like coinbase..
