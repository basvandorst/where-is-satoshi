I'm very new to this game but, if this was a phishing scam how did his account get locked before he was phished? Ie the sykpe and headerless emails. I have used binance a bit and with 2 fa and a strong password I would have thought that only multiple failed login attempts could be used to purposefully lock an account (and then a phishing scam to try an get back in to it)  but if that happened surely you would have got a tonne of texts from the 2fa? 
Please excuse my ignorance but this sounds more like binance fucking up and trying to hide it that a scam. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:19:39
Yeah that's what I was trying to say but if someone repeatedly tried to access your account and you have 2fa then wouldn't the OP have been texted an emailed. If I do anything on binance whether it be log in from a new device or different IP or receive/deposit/withdraw funds I get a text and and email. When I send funds I have to confirm that via an email. So either the OP didn't have 2fa active. Which is dumbest thing ever if you have 100's of bitcoin on an exchange. 
So is the OP conveniently not mentioning these texts/emails or where they not sent.

Yeah, I mean at least they somewhat pay for that themselves although the massive bailouts there have been over the past ten years probably means they actually haven't. Guess what's paying for the government to print money, us an our taxes.

To be honest I don't have much BTC and I completely agree that if you are just thinking about the value as a currency then who knows. I've never viewed Crypto as a pure representation of value. Which is why I don't really have much BTC. What has always fascinated me is the tech not the money. And for that reason I'm heavy in Cardano I love their ethos I love Haskell and am learning Rust to develop dApps on their protocol. This is beyond speculation as you can see tech develop and see it work or not, but will it make me money. Maybe not from the Ada but being able to build smart contacts and dApps certainly will. 
£15000 was ridiculous but as all other cryptos are tied to BTC so I have to follow. I wish last December had never happened and we could all be happy that the price average has increased from $4644 last year to over $6000 this year and was way below that in 2016. 
I basically think people will buy because it's cheap to answer your question though. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:42:24
What do you mean what I think? I think most people panicking are people that have never seen Bitcoin this low. Which means they jumped in the end of last year and that's the only graph they have seen. 
My point is BTC was under £1000 for a long time 2017. Does that mean BTC was fucked before it hit £15000 last December? Or does it mean that £15000 was a completely unrealistic propped up price and was always gonna fall hard this year. 
If you can go from 1000 to 15000 in a few months, then we can go from 4000 to the Moon or crash to fuck all in the same time. 
My personal view is Bitcoin is worthless as a currency until its stable and massive adoption has taken place but then Bitcoin is pointless for what we want it for now, which is to make money. 
Surely people will start buying now. I'm gonna be buying now. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:19:53
Take the monthly average of BTC price for 2017 now compare to monthly average of 2018. Which is higher. 
We can always be optimistic. 
It's like people have conveniently forgotten that BTC was around £1000 for a lot longer than it was at £15000 in 2017. And back down to £6000 - £7000 in February. 
Last October BTC was at the same price as it is now. Last December was just stupid an now everyone thinks they've lost everything because they bought for FOMO. And for no logical reason thought it was gonna hit hundreds of thousands within a year. 
BTC would be pointless without gains and losses. Just ride it out. It will all be fine.

Jan '20 £6000
Jan '21 £100000
Makes sense to me.

If Bitcoin was stable then nobody would have ever ever ever bothered with it. You can not make money if you buy at $1000 and it stays at $1000 for ever. Bitcoin is not a currency yet. I really hope it will be one day but that day will be the end of crypto making people large amount of money. It will also be the day that people stop losing large amount of money. 
Say you brought a fancy laptop two weeks ago and it cost you 0.1 BTC what would the price be today?
Say you brought a fancy laptop two weeks ago and it cost you $600 what would the price be today? 
The answer not 0.1 BTC and still $600.
You are right it is gambling though. To an extent.

Why is $10 worth $10? A $10 note is not worth anything and if you rip it in half it's not worth $5. If you rip a BTC in half it's worth 0.5 BTC. 
I think what you are getting at is BTC has no relationship to the value of commodities. Which it can't until it's stable. But when it's stable people won't make money off it. Seems like a catch 22 situation. 
It boils down to things are worth what people are willing pay for them. And worth less if there's more available. 
There is no fundamental value of money. It's just a representation of value. All this is just what I think I have no clue really. I'm an engineer not an accountant.

They won't have a choice. I feel that people feel that it's up to the government to regulate value. Ie money but I don't think that's the case. If I say something it worth something and everyone else says it's worth that much then it is. 
If I employ people I can choose to pay them in whatever means they will accept. People think this is trying to get around tax but it's not. If I paid people in sheep the government would be entitled to 20% of the amount of sheep I paid them not the value converted in to pounds or dollars of the sheep. It's up to them how they regulate sheep received. 
There is nothing to stop shop owners trading instead of taking cash. As long as you declare what you received you could send back your tax return and not attach any Fiat value to it. 
This year I made 3 cows, 12oz of gold, 24 bales of hay and a round of cheese. If that was worth over £11000 then you would have to pay 20% of the value it was over by but not in pounds because in this extremely ridiculous situation I do not own any pounds. 
If people and businesses get paid an pay in crypto. No one can force you to convert it in to you countries currency. But you still have to pay tax so as long as you say I got paid 10 BTC this year to the government They will have to find a way to accept it. 
But none of this can happen unless BTC is stable. Which we wouldn't want would we coz then we wouldn't make any money.  
Please don't smash me for this post I'm being silly to show that value is up to the people not the government.

Yeah I have no idea, I can just remember seeing the amount of money it cost to buy a loaf of bread being in stacks that were bigger than a loaf of bread. I couldn't even remember of it was Venezuela. But whichever county it was people were saying they were turning to crypto.

Saying things are not convenient doesn't mean they shouldn't be used. I remember 56k dial up internet. That was inconvenient. Nobody would every of dreamed that less than 20 years down the line I could use the evolution of that technology to write a message on my phone whilst sat on the toilet, that everyone in the world could read.

I'm pretty sure you understand exactly what I mean. But if not let me explain. If Bitcoin was at the same price as it was in 2008. Would you have even heard about it? When it was worth a few pence? If you had brought 1000 Bitcoin when it was at that price would you have wanted it to be stable. Or would you have wanted it to massively increase in value? The only point in Bitcoin for the time being as a currency is to buy drugs and to invest in and try and make money. Which you can do which both massive drops and gains. 
As I had to wait 6 hours for a transaction to be confirmed last night, who even gives a shit if its stable if it takes that long anyway, what am I going to do sit in a shop for 6 hours while I buy a TV. 
So as things like transaction speeds increase, greater security, battles with rivals in the space occur and greater accessibly is achieved the price will not be stable. Also where's the Dollar sub reddit and how active is it's community? Would people be interested in this thing that 10 years ago was worthless if it was still worthless. Would there be any discussion, would people support development and drive the project. No. 
Also I didn't know the dollar was only a decade old, brand new technology that was constantly being developed and built in to a global decentralised measure of value.... Oh wait.

I'm not saying if you are paid in fiat in another country  staying of you are paid in commodities. I don't know the law as my country is dumb and doesn't have one written down haha. (or I'm just not a lawyer). But if you never hold currency of any kind... 


I'm not saying they would shrug it off, if everyone just decided they were now only using crypto (which I know wouldn't happen straight away) they would have to except it. Governments are there for the people not the other way round. They will have to massively regulate it in the future but how do you regulate something like Monero you can't. Governments could ban it, but I would think that that would just make it more popular. 
And a thing I always think about (except income tax coz that just comes out my wage) is I chose to pay tax if everyone stopped paying tax out protest governments in 1st world counties couldn't do anything other than listen to the people and do what they have decided. 
You said your Canadian? I don't know a massive deal about how it happened, but lots of people smoke weed in Canada I guess, they said they aren't gonna stop smoking weed and in my opinion quite rightly continued. So eventually it was made legal. 
If people use crypto, say they are not gonna stop and just refuse anything else, then it's in the countries best interest to get on board. 
This is all just a fantasy I know. But people resisted the internet it was just a bubble, why would anyone want or need such a thing. But I assume thoughout all the negativity from the opposition the beginnings of Amazon eBay and Google was slowly coming together people decided they didn't want to go to retail shops, wanted an easy way to sell their stuff and wanted immediate access to all the info the world has to offer. And it happened. 
I am by no means an expert on any of this stuff it's just my thinking but laws and regulations do change when the majority demand it. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:49:18
If last December had never happened (I know it did but just for the sake of argument we will ignore that stupid propped up price) BTC price for 5 months early 2017 was below £1000. So if the price stays around £3000-4000 this year and next q1 that is still 4x increase over 2 years. 
Maybe I'm not looking at this the right way bit that to me does not indicate BTC is dead.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the ~~marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation~~ bosses in the current financial sector as "a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes," with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of ~~robotics~~ Bitcoin correspondent.
Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica that had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future defined the ~~marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation~~ bosses in the previous financial sector   as "a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came."

You can say it's worth 6 times less now that it was then. If something is worth 12 whatever in January but in February it's worth 2 whatever then it's worth 6 times less. I'd be more concerned about saying the current "worrying economy" is not a reason to adopt crypto. Surely that's a good reason, to escape the current system? 
I saw a post the other day saying we should judge price by yearly lows. Which made me happy as it clearly shows a year on year increase.

All these comments saying you don't need to understand make me sad. It's completely true I guess. I don't know how banks work or the financial sector at all really, but I use money every day. 
My point would be that the not understanding all the ins and outs of how finances work is because it's hidden and governed by powers that would lose out of we knew too much. (Maybe a bit paranoid)
The face that you can learn and it's so transparent is what is appealing to me about Blockchains. But I guess not everyone. 
If Bitcoin ever becomes a mass adopted form of currency everyone will have to be able to use it without understanding. The same as people can use fiat without understanding how money is issued, inflation and how it's regulated. But it will be the people who do understand that will probably benefit the most I would have thought. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:30:36
Posts like this lift my heart. It's never been completely about the money for me. I buy what I can and hope it will help me out in the future. But getting to live though the technical revolution of the internet and now being in grossed in the evolution of Blockchain tech. Seeing it come though it's infancy, seeing people get excited and debating with the doubters. Building dApps and learning about all the exciting applications that Bitcoin and more generally Blockchains themselves will serve. 
There will be a day when the response to, "how much is a BTC worth..." will be "Well it's worth 1 BTC"
The current fiat price just means I can buy more at the moment. Which is excellent, but obviously sad if you brought at $20k. I guess I like to look at it in a strange way, I don't look at my back account daily or hourly even and compare the amount to GBP/USD or GBP/EUR. So I don't particularly feel the need to do this with crypto. I know the fiat value will go up AND down but I still have the same amount of Bitcoin. If it's ever gonna be used as a real currency it will have to be stable one day and relate to the value of real things not other currencies. That's the day I'm gonna be bothered about it's value.
