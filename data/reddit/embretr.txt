Same as you would with other paper wallet generators. Public review / predetermined hash signature?
It'd be nice to have a trusted entity create the sticks, and being a paid product, the vendors have an incentive to do it right, rather than risking a backlash for small-time amounts of money.
E.g. Bitcoin foundation chould set up a reasonably secure production environment and ship everything in sealed packages. With random samples being tested to be okay.
This should be okay for amounts between okay-to-store-in-a-hot-wallet-"pocket change", but less than "full blown papanoid" amounts of money, where you NEED to go 100% secure.

This was slightly hard to read, but yeah. Bitcoin value will rise sharply if the adoption/use increases. Every time you put more money into it, the price will rise less and less, so it will not be a accelerating increase im price once everybody are familiar with the concept and the true value has been discovered. Think of it, as rolling a a snowball uphill. It'll get bigger and bigger, until it's too heavy to push uphill anymore.
That means the only way you as a bitcoin owner can lose value, is if everybody else changes their opinion on what a bitcoin is worth. It is uncertain at the moment what the long term value will be, but it is a very transparent process. You're not promised insane returns on your investment that are secretly someone else's money (plus skimming necessary profit to the scheme owner), once new investors stop coming to the table, those profits will drain the entire sceme of value, and as such are a deliberate act of fraud.
There are risks, like suddenly new information comes to light, technological issues may pop up, or the entire market may just not be happy about bitcoin anymore. At no point have you been lied to about the nature of bitcoin, and you'll still be left with value afterwards (you got a bitcoin. It's less valuable, but you still got it, so yay!)

If the talk is serious about getting the network to scale beyond Visa in capacity, the decentralized funding of nodes should be figured out somehow. 
There has been some talk about Adopt-a-Nodes. In which a node is possible to get up and running without doing the technical parts of the job you have done (some may find this intetesting and rewarding, but not all), but rather fund a VPS instance and get credit somehow. Is somebody were inclined to tip you for your services, you could run twice as many instances in other geographical locations as well, so it's not "doing ut for payment" as much as it is "enabling you to help more, by having expertise others lack"
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:37:15
If you look at the numbers at [bitinfocharts]( last 24hours has dogecoin at 50% of the transaction value of bitcoin, more transactions than all other currencies *put together* (1.3tx/second) and could overtake bitcoins number of nodes within a couple of weeks. 
Not bad for a two month old project
If you look at what technical merits it has, it is nothing fancy: insanely low transaction fees, 60second confirmation time 5 billion increase/annum in money supply, after coin 100.000.000 and two teams in the coming olympic games.

got the same email. could be some sort of service that has been compromised. 
what kind of exchanges are you signed up to?
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:29:06
I see that what you're looking for is some sort of third party that will remove volatility. This will not be happening in a while.
You sell fridges, not bitcoins. If the exchange value goes from 1btw to .08btc in 7 days, the customer would have experienced the same on their end. 
Record all bitcoin transactions as a timestamp + value pair. If you state this clearly in the receipt, the customer got this value at that point in time; Whenever the customer want a refund authorized, record also timestamp + current value, and have the customer verify the amount. To make it better (wait until customer verification before you buy the required funds, if you want to have zero holdings in bitcoin yourself).
If the dollar amount stays the same, this should be pretty solid.. unless there's legal stumble blocks somewhere.
If you're fair &amp; up front about the policy, and have a separate 
"☑ *I'm aware that special conditions on product returns apply*". 
.. no matter the reading comprehension skills of the customer, this should be good enough for most customers. 
Don't make bitcon payment a default-, but rather a customer-selected option.
If they want to complain to better business burey, they'd then have a beef with MtGox (or bitstamp) that the value has changed (but the comparable dollar amount should stay the same).
One gotcha is verifying that the the funds should be returned to the same bitcoin adress they transferred from.

For merchants: No signup fees. No cost of using proprietary payment hardware. No recurring fees for being connected to the network. Reasonable transmission fees, and zero fees in connection to accepting payment. No hassle once a payment has cleared.
The big difference is you don't have to ASK anyone for permission to broadcast a transaction onto the network, and it's zero cost to inbound transactions, which is a great deal different to how most other systems are run.
I just got the yearly service fee of using my Visa card, and it's to the tune of 0.09 BTC, in addition to usage fees.

I see what the author has in mind in suggesting what direction bitcoin should grow and what kind of people should be involved, but have my own take on this.
One good thing about the transparency of bitcoin, would be that the state, and politicians would be reluctant to do anything to an economy that affects 30 - 60% of their population. 
If they're able to marginalize and make "weirdos" of bitcoin users, it is much easier harm a small minority, than a sizeable, and very visible percentage of the population. 
Enter: **the Spartacus Defence** ^(tm). 
If I use bitcoin. If you use bitcoin. If everybody you know use bitcoin, BEFORE the big push to marginalize; it should be smooth sailing.
Growing adoption and enthusiasm should not only be seen as a nice thing, but an important defence strategy.

@_date: 2014-01-01 11:10:03
The short and long answer is yes.
Short term, there may be increased transaction volume. Nobody's forcing you to use coinkite, but if it's reasonably priced for the ease of use, I see nothing wrong with it. The cancellable donation-by-email is a nice way to force the issue for recievers.
The long answer is also yes. Increasing number of accepting organizations is growing the bitcoin economy will increase the degree of success, and most likely cause increased transaction fees as well.
tl;dr: rising tide and all that

Hmm... nice site. It's a bit image-heavy and loads slowly over in Norway.
One thing. I had to go through ALL checkout steps to get to the bitcoin logo, otherwise I have no idea that it is an option at all. (you want people to shop at your place because you accept bitcoin right?) That info needs to be visible early in the process, since it may get a sale out of the right customer. 
Otherwise, what way have you promoted it, so far? You're visible at places like coinmap? My bitcoin business was listed there by someone else, and we get like 20% of our traffic from that site.. o_0
Immediate action points:
- Consider adding a bitcoin logo beside the paypal &amp; visa ones, on the footer of the web shop.
- Add the place on coinmap.org (you're not going to remove support anytime soon, right?)
- make a limited run coupon code 'suaveredditkids' or something, and do a reddit ad on the bitcoin subreddit? you want to prompt people to go experience the sales process, and invite them to give you feedback on it it's well worth the rebate. Kids need lots of clothes, so some of them could become recurring customers if this is something you get right.

Fair enough, half of r/bitcoin is holding so it's a slight bias here, as well.


I guess they try to move as little money as possible. Just keeping all branches sufficiently liquid, and do any money movement in industrial-grade transfers.

I make a point to tip nothing lower than chief scientists, and do it publicly on their facebook wall. I then take note of how long the funds remain unspent, and ybase my own prediction on price movements off that. I favor the private-key approach, as you or someone else may 'rescue' those funds, if the recipient is unresponsive forever, and it gives a deeper insight into the tech, than having to sign up for some centralized service.
Coinbase-tipping where you sign up with your facebook or email feels a bit J.W.-y and sleazy, handing over from me to you the magic numbers that are currently worth $5, feels like *math*, and will make people feel a little bit religious when all the pieces click together.

If it doesn't walk like a duck and quack lile a duck, when all you need is a duck broadcasted to the network, within 15 minutes.. it is pretty misleading to keep calling it a duck. 
Especially when newcomers unaware of the duck-issue will lose time and possibly money and NOT being aware that the problems originate with the duck-advertised-as-a-duck-but-isn't-really, and not the 100% duck-compliant network and the tech behind it..
Naming different things the same isn't a good way to gp about things. Now if Coinbase has problems, it'd be helpful to realize that the issue could be mitigated by not relying on their slow handling of their internal accounts-to-central-wallet and instead choose another entity to keep an account with, or go for handling "spending coins" from your own wallet with a reliable performance.

[the above address right, can be seen here for example]( 0 coin in this address, and no traffic, ever.
If there were coins in it, anyone with the access to a private key can authorize a transaction to any other address, and visa versa. No need for banks, credit card processing, merchant account, secret transaction fees or currency conversion fees, other than the mining network that is powering the whole operation.
By design, the cost of running bitnet should be close to equilibrium, with the cost of electricity for powering the whole network, except that in a time of strong growth that value can be negative (miners can lose money running bitcoin nodes, mining), because they believe the value will increase over time.

They want their taxes even if bitcoin implodes? Or competition with US dollars (Federal bonds, state bonds, or money market funds).
A benign interpretation would be that for something operating as a "bank" it should be considered bad to store their funds 100% in dogecoin, if that jeopardize the general operation. That part is just an extra fuck you to botcoim startups in my opinion, and as it stands, makes it hard for business owners to accept and could make it hard to hold a percentage of bitcoin revenue, for *future payment* to bitcoin-accepting suppliers.
This would be a start for big dollar financial use of the  blockchain, but I'd guess a towel in the face to grassroots use and adoption in NY, and not elsewhere.

Same way you trust an ATM when you instert your plastic card in a new city; *it usually works.*
I would've used [Coinbase]( as an appropriate example if I were aware of them at the time of writing. 
Point I was making, is that the cheapest, simplest $30 dollar phones will be able to interact with the block-chain, by doing a quick interfacing with SMS. Even the Apple kind. At 0.5¢ a pop you can do a BUNCH of transactions/month before you're close to anything like $10/month. This will be important if you're thinking about making it big in the poorer demograpics for international money transfers and remittances.

Just watched Non Stop (movie /w Liam Neeson) and liked the way text messages were overlayed on the screen. 
How about filming in person transactions, and doing an on-screen representation of how the money moves from peraon to person. "Sending payment." -&gt; "Payment recieved"
And then doing a No Banks twist. My take is that the usability of doing bitcoin transactions is seriously undervalued, and doing a bunch of transactions in 30 seconds a little bit like the [AT&amp;T 1993-1994 'You Will' Ad Campaign]( commercials. 
Run a bunch of talking points, and show as many real time transactions in the background as time will allow. This could be good.
Ideas for transactions to showcase usability:
Find a good joke on r/jokes and give reddit gold, pay for a Uber ride with bitcoin, send coins to charity with Seansoutpost, contribute to the worlds total knpwledge with wikipedia, find a local café/merchant accepting over the counter transactions... bunch of stuff to do, so pick what people are most enthusiastic about.

You don't have to, since people will not be handing out payment info to any of the 100's of businesses they have already used credit card details at. Friend of mine got a warning from his bank that he had booked a hotel reservation for $7 in his business' credit card, and then suddenly got 10 transactions of about $1000 happening shortly after. This all happened after they got an e-mail from someone they had done business with, that said they could possibly have had their systems compromised.. I'm thinking, fuck *that*. If that's the best system that's currently available it's about time for an upgrade

Fancy [smoked bacon]( available for purchase with bitcoin
I mentioned this [3 weeks ago]( and thought I’d keep you updated. The initial post, got almost 22k views, and caused 3 new customers, to drop by at the following farmer’s market. As far as digital money being easy to implement, and bringing in new, happy customers, I’ll call Myth Confirmed!, on this one.
One problem, since this wasn't expected, that the wallet wasn't funded quite enough..  (come on, how often do *you* stumble across a bitcoin business in the city square?) No problem though! A being back after a quick top-up of the Blockchain wallet (on iPhone hardare!), we were good to go. Slightly impressive as a vendor, to have a customer put in extra effort and be back after getting more funds, but that's the kind of enthusiasm that makes it tempting to implement bitcoin as payment.

Most people using 2 factor tokens with online banking services find this adequate for securituy. If people start using secure practices, in addition to time-delayed multisignature withdrawals for larger amounts the security will be all right for most purposes.

The thing about bitcoin is that the value will go UP or DOWN, according to what value sellers and buyers agree upon, for each and every transaction. 
Early buyers, getting an incomprehensible return on investment because they were close to the source, early adopters, did not sell their share early because their knowledge of the concept make them believe in a rising value,  is **not** a design flaw or 'wrong' in itself. 
If anything it is a feature in that will lead the currency to have a trading value that will increase initially, and eventually taper off, as a maximum value of current utility and future potential are reached.
*Not a Ponzi scheme, unless all startup ideas are considered the same.*
The thing people SHOULD more worried about, is mining rewards reduction before there's transaction fees to reward continued mining effort. Or any one of the future technical challenges, other than the initial funding mechanism of bitcoin, because that is one of the more transparent financial processes, ever.

I'm aware of that, and that's not quiite enough to bring this project to the moon. How about organizing a "leaderboard" to make that contribution visible (it'd be nice to have each running node have a "sponsor" tag (maybe.) running, to have some visibility to the effort you're putting in. Secondary goal in the future, could be to have some actual tipping happen, for people willing, but unable to contribute.  Rule of thumb for businesses, disburse half a percentage of mining fees to full nodes, as a part of "good bitcoin behavour".

I don't see the car analogy *malfunctioning* at all. The whole idea is that if you make expensive decisions, say, you buy a house close to a bus stop, and expect to use that as transport to and from work every day. This could be a faulty assumption.
Since you do not have a say in how the bus company is run, the bus route can be changed, or dropped altogether leaving you high and dry, potentially losing a bunch of value thst you put into the decision to lock down your money into the house relying o  the bus, or just majorly inconvenience you wasting a bunch of your time. 
The are many modes of failure with bus transport. The bus company could go out of business, or be bought up by a company hostile to public transport. If you're taiing the same bus as suspect individuals, the bus you're using could become a crime scene; the whole operation then locked down by govt. agencies pending a drawn out court case..
If you're using a vehicle where you own the keys fully, a bunch of those weak points can be avoided by running your own car instead. It may be a bit more maintenance, and you have to select a brand you trust, but at least you no longer need to trust your hard earned wealth with the continued success of the bus company.

Sorry to disappoint, but current tech has a problem of scaling much further than the moon, at the moment.
The average distance between Mars and Earth is about 2.5 x 108 kilometres. That is about 155 million miles, or about 13.86 light minutes.
Since Bitcoin is TCP/IP-based we need a full roundtrip time of 27.72 minutes just for the handshake. Even if we using UDP the whole protocol will break down.
This will basically ruin the whole mining and confirmation process, and will impair the ability for interplanetary Bitcoin-transactions. Before Bitcoin will go to the Mars, we need to find a solution for this

This is BIG, because getting into this for merchants are much easier if the handling of cash streams and accounting are as easy as making a bitcoin address, and putting up a Bitcoin sticker.
Missing piece of the Puzzle in my opinion, and might actually bring on more savings for many businesses than CC fees, when all is said and done.

The thing about wanting a discount is legitimate, but realize that handing *the business's* money over to a bank is a situation of limited competition and de-facto monopoly. When business lack a free and competitive choice, unresonable fees follow.
Your consumer choice nets the bank a nice cut of every transaction, paid out of the business' money. If you want to argue technicalities, it's not a charity, since it's not your money that you give away, but to believe that those monies isn't paid by you through higher price levels (cash and cc purchases), that's to believe in free lunches.


This is taking care of your interests in much the same way 'peeing your pants, to keep warm' is a poor strategy over time. It might feel comfortable in the short term, but it'd say it works against your bigger goals, by introducing an ineffeciency in 90% of your monetary transactions.
Improvement in payment system competition might happen over time, but expect a majority of the businesses you deal with to be late to the party if they do it in their own pace. (a corporate environment isn't ideally suited to push new technology and new ideas)

Small celebration: Just had my first repeat customer, buying smoked meat with bitcoin. I found it pretty interesting to see that he was using Blockchain app on the iPhone, and got this comment when I asked to snap a picture.. 
Thought it's a nice occasion to point out that it's a shame that unless Apple policies change, I may very well lose this business, if this particular customer decide to upgrade his device, and lose the ability to use iPhone as a easy-to-use payment device.
This saturday, of about 50.000 daily transactions, at least two were from people puchasing fancy smoked meats, on a windy farmer's market! It's not a million dollar deal, but a slice of what the future might look like
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:56:41
I'm thinking of implementing a web shop selling smoked meats only accepting digital money. Does that count?
Anyways. Have anybody looked into pay-for-time services like public laundry machines, EV charging spots and such? Zero human interaction or fees and possibility to keep off-block-chain balances (prepay cash to avoid fees and get percentages off).
A bunch of EV charging network around my place hand out electricity for free, because they cannot be bothered to implement a payment service (too few users/too small profits  yet). While a bitcoin-powered relay really need an arduino with a WiFi or M2M shield as a proof of concept. If such services show up it shouldn't be hard to make services that interface regular money with special-purpose bitcoin balances, for those that do not have bitcoin but still want to use the service.

Yes, and no. There's ways to keep your bitcoins secure and there are ways to keep your car secure.

A pretty crazy idea would be to calculate the, price history curve of each transaction, that way you can see what the coins were worth at the cheapest, and how much price increase the holders realize whith each transfer.
Insane numbers, but could be interesting to separate day to day trading, versus investment and whether people realize gains or losses.
@_date: 2014-01-01 10:04:27
You really should not do that calculation with bananas (bitcoin), then ;)

This entirely relies on the assumption that the digital currency will suddenly revert to zero value, and stay there.

Fees are 0.3% of Block rewards as it is. Miners are incentivized to add all transactions once they find a new block, since this just removed the main bottleneck in pushing all transactions onto a block at once. You're still free to ignore zero-fee transactions though, so it's still supply&amp;demand on fees

You'd have a lot more people consider the points you make, if you cared to post stuff like this, and not throw around 'shitcoin' so much.
You're right that "peak attention" for bitcoin is coming sometime in the future. This is is where things are going to get interesting. Most people should be aware that if bitcoin do not gain sufficient volume before mining rewards decline, the whole thing will collapse in on itself. Not to zero but at least not 9 figures market cap.
The government regulation need not be a bad thing, as it would legitimize bitcoin a lot, as long as there's a competitive edge over "traditional" payment networks. As you say. 
As for transaction fees. At the current pace that's right, but if you use off-blockchain providers that bunch up 10 and 10 transfers much like coinbase for user-to-user transfers, you'd get down to reasonable numbers, while being able to  profit from it as a service provider.
I'd be more worried about the eventual loss of anonymity such services could cause, than long-term potential of most altcoin ecosystems.

It's really hard to get insolvent when you're not practicing fractional reserve banking. Any Exchange can AT ANY MOMENT close up shop and run off with all the coins, so it's prudent to not store to much value at any one exchange, and be careful with whom you trust.

Now a couple of ideas.
-A good way to launch is to do an infographic (about bitcoins/ validating notes and the 1000 high-end node goal). My brother are good with infographics, or someone famous like theoatmeal could be invited to participate.
-Extra hands: should more people be invited to pitch in skills and input before the project is "launch ready"? Design+webdev. Anything else that could be useful to bring aboard on the project?
-pricing; $5/month / $60 a year is where we're at? Will there be a problem handling $60k in donations if everything goes well? (upside risk) what's your thoughts on paying with bitcoins?
- building credibility is key in getting people to be comfortable throwing cash after this project and reaching mission goals.. do you have any ideas on how to present proof that nodes are legit and the funds are spent in an efficient manner? Webserver on each node (the ip you posted went down?), may be a bit overkill, but it's a neat solution.
-any ideas how else to create value for contributors&amp;the public at large? Stats from the nodes running. Web that show credit while adopted nodes are alive&amp;running? Ability to vote on where next node should be located?(place high end nodes in different locations to spread the joy around)
Sounds good so far? As for timeline.. Launch before the holidays?

There's lots of interesting things happening once the transaction cost of currency transfers approach the cost of electricity.
Hopefully this wil cause bitcoin to level off at a higher price point, and single orders will have a neglible impact on price, and bitcoin adoption causes transfer fees to self-finance the network.
This possibility is the reason people assign value to bitcoin today (in addition to the bubbly-asset nature). The idea is that the rate of increase in awareness of the concept should level off (media hype&amp;valuation is a pretty strong positive feedback loop atm.) the price should level off as well, and less volatility is expected.
For merchants should have a pretty nice incentive to push for adoption (effortless implementation/appealing value proposition), and the use could become more mainstream once the infrastructure is ready for 'low-tech' users.

[Good to go, captain!]( 
I'd suggest the following..
- Get at hosting provider that takes btc as payment.
- Set up a page describing the budget, and projected expenses. 0.1 btc collected, so far = adopt a server for x months, that encourages people to contribute. Btc added = increase in month counter, within 5 minutes for extra warm fuzzy feelings for contributors. 
- Throw in a stretch goal; prepay 18 months, and another box will be added to the pool. If this stuff scales, you could actually talk to hosting company matching donations to the node pool, against honorable mention.
- Throw in a statistics page, making live stats from the node network available; giving contributing interesting information, and increasing interest in contribution.
- Throw in a how-to guide: providing best practices and a bit background about how running nodes should be a priority.
Once you got this. You should do check to see if r/bitcoin are interested in doing another round of funding, as well as checking with the mods to see if this initiative can be placed in the sidebar.
Sounds good?

This depends on the transaction volume. I'm not saying bitcoin NEEDS and offline presence, just the $850m remittance market, would be a nice transaction volume in itself.. 
But to have bitcoin get off the ground, giving brick and mortar businesses access to the "money of internet", are currently a good way to get bitcoin stakeholders interested ("[Paypal]( except with 0.00x% fees?" It's at least worth a look into for most..) 
Their audiences exposed to actual bitcoin use in the wild, will drive up person-to-person use as well.

The bigger issue, except for the readability, is that currently you have to have some sort of idea who you're dealing with (trust &amp; reputation online, or over-the-counter payment). This is smooth sailing for 90% of the enthusiasts, but can be challenging for more mainstream tech consumers.. You should not ever need to *type* in a payment adress by hand, ever.
In the future there could be some sort of trust-building systems where you can directly track the number of successful bitcoin volume of different vendors, and you'll see who is making money from actual healthy business, and who are accepting money with the main purpose of scamming customers.

- have a look around at the ecosystem, and get to know different projects that are out there, it's easier and quite a bit to learn from pitching in on an existing project, instead of starting up a big project from scratch
- buy $20-50 worth of btc, to spend around, try go get a feel about what could be optimized about the end-user experience. 
- one thing I'm looking into is making more high-quality VPS-based full bitnet nodes coming online, through a tipping system. Consider setting up one such for yourself just to get a feel about what that is a about

EDIT: also, for businesses, getting offers for specialized hardware for full nodes could be an interesting idea. Minimum power requirements, ample storage, possibly a fallback module for GPRS and battery powered operation. If this got together for less than the running costs of a standard payment processing, there could be better uptime guarantees in case of emergency and lower fees for customers.

Consider this.. even with the recent swings, the 10 minute volatility is 1,8% over the last hour. This is _cheaper_ than merchant fees on CC transactions. Give it a bit, to ride out the initial jump in awareness, and a more stable valuation will make this more useful. Just how useful remains to be seen, but quite enough people are betting HEAVY money on this not being a fad. 
Another thing, this enables a single solution to enable the long-tail economy of microtransactions, that currently just doesn't exist due to current solutions not being very good at solving that problem..

Not to worry. This is what knowledge feels like.

Everytime you have your bitcoin stolen, you're funding criminals that are slowing down adoption. Don't fund criminals!
Also.. how about a bitcoin honey pot to catch scammers red handed?

the solution is for the merchant to price that difference to be visible to the customer. that and off-blockchain settlement of small purchases

I'd argue that attention is inherently valuable.

That's pretty awesome right there. Consider spending a bit, and talk to people accepting btc for donations, goods or services to improve the way they present their services (it's very new to most people yet...)
A project I'd love to see myself, would be some sort of automatic tracking and tippng people running full network nodes, as that is curretly a space that can be improved..  
If you're good with linux, that could be something to look into, if you're just into some learning, most any project will be useful, just to get going.

I've misplaced my regular plastic card while inebriated, before. Can't wait until the day I lose my bitcoin wallet + phone to a drunk mistake. The future is pretty bright!

Have cash in an exchange?

I think a better approach to get this off the ground could be to pool resources and shop for serves specced properly, and have the servers paid for in bitcoin.
Nice for the economy, and better impact than 10's of separate efforts like this.
