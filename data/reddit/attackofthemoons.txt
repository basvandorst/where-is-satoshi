I'm pretty sure any video editing software has something called video overlay. You just have to put the image on the video and makes timeline to keep the pic over the face, it takes a while to do though.

If there is an Apocalypse, I don't think gold has any use to make it have intrinsic value. Everyone would have to agree it is worth something for people to still use it

@_date: 2017-12-30 17:40:52
Can you elaborate more on this?
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:47:57
I have an aol address and I am not a super rich old guy

If you're in Australia, you might be looking at the graph upside-down.

I mean to be fair you have to add "backed by the best country on the planet"
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:20:23
Thank you this explains it to the depth that I had wanted.

I thought about this and a question came to mind, if everyone is hashing the same way, with the same algorithm, wouldn't the fastest computer win every time?
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:27:19
Idk if coinbase has a card but it has a program for underage people to buy bitcoin with parents approval
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:44:18
Either way wouldn't it be listed in a top 5 most popular exchanges or am I missing something
@_date: 2019-02-26 06:18:24
Thank you for explanation
@_date: 2019-02-13 04:19:16
If the internet went down completely, hypothetically, would bitcoin still work with this or somewhere there needs to be internet in this process?

I think hedging with bcash is closer to burning 100$ and hoping it turns into more,  because with guessing the refs shoe color at least there's a chance.
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:51:07
With that logic selling shoes would also be a crime since shoes aren't legal tender either. That is so backwards that your bank did that.
@_date: 2019-02-26 06:18:19
Thank you for explanation

Could someone explain what a physical storage is in regards to the new Samsung Galaxy S10. How is it different to just getting an app that lets me hold my private keys?
@_date: 2019-02-26 06:19:21
Thank you for explanation, personally I have none of my private keys cause I feel like I will either lose or break my devices that I would store them on, so its safer with a third party
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:02:33
It would be weird for him, because all his friends why he is named after the only currency
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:58:43
Isn't gdax popular ?

I think he said his dad died not his aunt.
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:06:12
O o f
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:37:51
But he said my duck, so he must already have a duck in mind
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:22:50
I didn't realize that.
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:11:54
I need some bamboozle insurance
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:10:17
Knife to meet you too.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:08:50
I think this defeats the purpose of tldr
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:50:53
How much more will it need to do that?
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:20:29
In a situation like this, would it be legal to say the rate is 1 btc = 20$?
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:28:15
Is the fee that low for lower amounts of money too, like 50-200$?
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:07:02
ONE OF US
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:44:17
What rate did you use/ how did you determine that rate
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:53:57
You could Photoshop the QR code
@_date: 2018-07-02 05:43:25
The greatest margin of increase I think you mean.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:56:44
Well yea. if you have ever adopted a dog, they ask for a donation and then you can have your dog.

Now to just wait for the moon
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:51:41
I'm pretty sure coinbase allows minors with their parents permission.
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:33:49
I think [this]( is better imo.
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:23:57
Literally me since like 400$
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:32:42
They don't even include Hawaii or Alaska in the map

Can you set up the trezor / ledger on a device connected to the internet?
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:26:39
Shame that there's only four digits that it can display.
