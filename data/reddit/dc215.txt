I would have probably sold at $3.3M.

$33.25M if he bought ETH at $0.70 and sold today.

I'm already a millionaire.  BTC is a way to diversify some investing.

Capital gains from investments.

It's somewhere around a half a cent USD per purchase.  How does one even purchase such small amounts?

When you buy a sandwich from subway with your visa debit card, there is also a fee for that transfer as well.  The question becomes, who pays the fee directly, and who pays the fee indirectly.

Part of that I think is because of the general public's inability to understand exactly what a Bitcoin is.  It's a fairly abstract concept for the average Joe.  And the exchanges don't exactly make the process seem easier to buy in for most people.

25+ years of saving and investing.  No debt.  Buy everything cash.  Paid off house.  Real estate investments.  Property holdings generating rent.  Etc.  And I'm by no means "rich".  Not driving lambos, that's for sure.  There's having $1M in holdings, then there's parking lambos on top of your ferraris, stupid Bill Gates rich.  I certainly don't have enough money to stop working and retire.  I'm in my mid 40s.  Will probably retire at 60.

This isn't my final form.  I started buying BTC about a week ago.  In my experience in investing, which spans a few decades, it's best to fully understand WTF you're doing when dumping money into something.  I've learned a lot in that first $2k+.  How the fuck you buy it, how you store it, all about shitcoins, etc.  I didn't say I'm only dumping in $2k, I said I just started.

I didn't say I'm done with BTC.  I said I just started.  Please, by all means, let me throw large sums of money at something before I fully understand how it works.

Correct.
