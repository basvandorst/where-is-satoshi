Must be close to that already. Coinbase has 30m users alone

Hi there!  First of all we have our own group here:  [ 
Second - have you tried local providers?  Specifically:
kiwi-coin (my favorite)
Easy crypto
Plus there is always local bitcoins.

" Going from $300 to $20k took about 200 billion give or take. "
This isn't quite right.  The actual money you need to move the BTC price is a tiny fraction of the actual total market cap.  As little as a 200M sell / buy order can easily move the price 2k.

Yeah he needed a house deposit.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:44:53
Still - an argument could be made that you couldn't short then so its an unfair comparison
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:49:20
I don't quite know, but from what he said it was around $250k (and its my friend not me haha)
@_date: 2019-10-31 22:23:11
Yes it did (though a glitch, not from trades).  Which caused Deribit to fall 2k in a second.

" ∙ Today's volume so far: 1131 BTC ∙ Last traded price: $8,622.50 ∙ Trading day progress: 54% (if this continues: 100% equals to 2095 BTC) "

That is true.  I guess its adds to volatility
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:44:29
Not quite ever.  May 2011

Be careful.  Its a very dangerous feeling (like a drug).  Make sure it doesn't cloud your judgement.  PS - you literally bought the bottom when everyone else was selling - pat yourself on the back!!!!

Plot twist.  What if President Xi was the 4Chan Poster?

I bought a tonne in 2013 and sold at a loss when we fell from $1300 to $700 or so.  In 2017 at the bottom I knew I wouldn't make the same mistake so doubled down :)
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:42:22
hahah hell no.  My rule is if a coin ever goes above 30% in the daily move, 90% of the time it will be lower in 24 hours.  I've sold using this rule for so many coins and never been wrong.

"system overload" "please try again later"
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:41:19
Oh dear what did he say? comment deleted
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:57:05
I'm up 30k :)
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:41:04
I know a guy with a HUGE amount of bitcoin who literally sold everything a day or two ago at like 7500.  He's been HODLing since 2011 and that was all it took to share him out.  Meanwhile I was buying more.
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:53:23
Bought at 7.5k last night.  Just had a big feeling.  Wish I'd have bought more now :)
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:09:02
Haha.  I've been here for a while.  But I'm sure some people are joining. :)
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:27:00
How many of them are dead?
@_date: 2019-10-31 22:23:21
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:27:17
Well.... a whole bunch of them lost their keys I'm thinking
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:30:51
Yes but the halfing will change that instantly to 9M of new money.  Then 4.5M the next halfing and so on, despite the fact that because of inflation money has less value and so it becomes gradually easier to maintain that fiat entry
