If the bet was right, I’m in. What are you putting up that I’m wrong?

If you’re good at something, never do it for free.

Bitcoin will bottom around $2000-2500, then will trade sideways for about 3-6 months, then the recovery starts. How do I know? The last 2 big run ups peaked, then dropped 85-90%, then rebounded from there over the course of 2 years. If you can sit on your investment for 2 yrs, start buying at sub $3k. It will be a 10-20 bagger. Reply to this comment in Dec 2020 to see if I’m right or wrong. I’m willing to bet I’m right. Good luck to those investors who are patient.

Do you even follow stocks? Or is this your first rodeo? Every investment (Stock/Forex/Crypto) that the fundamentals remain unchanged, will recover over time. PERIOD. Haven’t you heard that “when there is blood in the streets...?” Or “when all are greedy, be fearful. And when all are fearful, be greedy?” 
If you haven’t, I recommend picking up One of Warren Buffett’s books. 
Now you have a choice. You can either continue to berate me when you don’t even know me, or you can take my advice and make some mutha fucking money. 
Your choice.....

Ladies and Gentlemen reading his comment, you now see that my prediction is correct. Angry keyboard warrior sitting in his parent’s basement. Unless he responds with something semi-intelligent. 
Let’s hear your prediction, BlindSpot.
