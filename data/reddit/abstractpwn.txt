Easy, scam dumb people on reddit by the looks of most of the posts in this sub :P
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:07:09
They can just use banks

You really need to ask this?

Survival of the fittest in action. People like that don't deserve to own crypto
@_date: 2019-03-17 22:27:49
You mean to say you were tricked into visiting a phishing site or you have malware on your computer and you are crying and blaming coinbase instead of educating yourself?
@_date: 2019-03-10 17:11:25
Can no longer tell if people are just trolling more or getting dumber

Do people actually fall for this shit?

Assume a crippling problem is discovered relating to security and suddenly the price drops to near 0... Life savings gone. At the current moment in time, cryptos are closer to gambling than saving. Not a single crypto algorithm have remained secure, they have been changed up every few years - and with quantum computers on the horizon there is no reason to believe that SHA is the one that will be unbreakable. That's not to say you shouldn't invest in them - just probably not your *entire* life savings...

I promise I am human :) Getting very interested in crypto
P.s. I am developer (Microsoft stack), pm me if you get a firm idea together
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:35:29
I really wouldn't recommend considering crypto as 'savings'...

Try this simple technique:
Step 1: Spend your last $ on a bus ticket
Step 2: Go get a job

If you are a bot, or can write a decent bot then sure. Doing it manually? Ha, no.
@_date: 2019-10-12 22:28:34
Yes. Many things do things that other things also do. Great observation.

Worry about getting a job and steady income before you put any money into Bitcoin. Ever read only spend money you can afford to lose? If your a poor student you cant afford to lose any money...

What is this, the 90's? :P

What if... bear with me... *random rediculous speculation*
Am I doing this right?
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:33:09
Lol nice try
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:45:51
You say:


What you mean to say is:
it seems reasonable to say that BTC's capacity to store and transfer value **will need to** increase 10x or more
Nothing you said is a reason why it will increase, just that it needs to if it must succeed as a primary method of transferring money
Now I'm all up for bitcoin succeeding, but be careful not to decide it will based merely on the fact that it will have to to become a mainstream method of money transfer. 
The sad truth is that people moving VERY LARGE amounts of money do not want to stomach **any** volatility, even small movements, so they won't use it in the first place in order to lower its volatility. Catch 22

Somewhere between 1 and all possible hashes
@_date: 2019-02-08 12:18:27
You may have the private key, but crucially SO DO THEY.  You are then trusting them to have perfect security and no malicious employees, which is much further outside your control than making sure your own computer is secure.

That is unfortunate for Belgians however the opposite is generally true in most countries which encourage investment in the energy sector. I imagine Belgium doesn't make up a large percentage of the total people engaged in mining. Large mining operations tend to set up in countries with low energy costs 
@_date: 2019-02-01 11:48:51
Why do think electricity price will increase over time? As new technology makes energy generation more efficient you would expect it to decrease

@_date: 2017-09-01 06:46:23
Yeah you don't start paying it back..... but it does start generating interest :S 
@_date: 2019-09-27 20:11:46
Yes for purchases fine. But buying crypto counts as a cash purchase (as far as I am aware for all the CCS I know of...) meaning instant interest, no cash-back or points. If you are getting these benefits buying crypto then I imagine you wont for long once they catch on

It doesn't work like that, the algorithms need to be rewritten for a quantum computer to run them. It doesn't run classical code

You must not value your time very much. You could have learned a skill in that time

His loss is already lost. Silver lining is he can take this as a learning experience and not be so gullible in the future

Asking strangers on reddit for financial advice shows maturity only obtainable by those over 40 :P
@_date: 2019-09-27 16:15:21
Not sure why all these fools are down voting you, you shouldn't be gambling ("investing") with credit. Get your net worth above 0 before you aim for 1,000,000
Edit: apparently some credit card companies dont count crypto purchases as cash advances, in that case by all means use a credit card while you can, imagine they will close this loop-hole quickly though as the major credit companies already have
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:06:52
Got any reasoning to back up that insight? Or you just randomly decided it?
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:16:34
Yeah totally, he should ideally just buy parts of a bitcoin each week, I had assumed he had decided not to do that for fees or whatever and wanted to buy it in one go, in which case its just a waste of time and (granted a very small amount, but still - free money?!) of interest to keep the money on coinbase when it could be in an interest generating account.
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:28:36
Why? You don't get interest in coin base, why not put in savings account till you have it all then send all at once?
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:11:52
Get a better savings account bro. If he can put 1,000 a week away he certainly has access to a better rate than 0.03 with his account
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:08:48
Where do you live? Get a better bank probably. That is definitely not the **best** rate you can get on a saving account
