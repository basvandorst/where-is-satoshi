I'm from Australia. I've just sent my id off to coinjar.io who I think Is a preferred Australian provider. I've been to bitaddress.com and printed off a paper wallet with 3 addresses. The max purchase per day through this merchant is $500, so I will buy $1500 over 3 days, and then transfer the coin from the merchants inherent Web based wallet to my paper wallet, over 3 addresses. 
Does this all sound right? Thought?

I made my very first deposit on Friday at an nab branch, got a message within an hour saying it was sweet, bought some bit coin 2 mins later. Just some bad luck I suppose

you're right in that they look out for themselves - but it is necessary given their situation. if you stumbled upon a very dangerous secret about very powerful people, you could trust wikileaks. 
if they went full bore and were "taken care of", you may not know where to turn with such sensitive information. you may have to give it to someone who either will not release the information out of corruption/fear, or who does not have to credibility to be taken seriously enough. wikileaks are cited often as a reliable source and paid attention to by numerous outlets worldwide.
i'd rather they expose 1/10th of 20 scandals, than 3 full scandals before getting totaled

I'm Australian. I've created an account on coinjar.io which has a $500 daily limit. I will buy 3x500 worth of coin, then transfer the them from the merchants online wallet service to 3 addresses on a paper wallet from bitaddress.com 
Does that all seem correct? Thoughts?
