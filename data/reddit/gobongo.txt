If your money had been in an "evil bank" it would have been insured.  I guess life isn't all roses in the land of cryptocurrency!

yup, there's no possible way this could go horribly wrong!

It is nice that bitcoin is mature enough (yet unregulated enough) that old-timey Wall Street people are beginning to run pump and dump schemes with it!

90% drops when btc was basically monopoly money were fine, 90% drops when 1 btc is the price of a new car is not sustainable.  Like not even once.
One 90% drop of btc's current value and lots of people are going to take very real, very painful losses (and yes, those people shouldn't have paid what they couldn't afford to lose, but we all know a lot of people do) and the PR backlash will make bitcoin effectively dead.  It'll never recover from another 90% drop.  Those days when it could are over.

Not on a "rest of your life" timeline.  
It is a good deal of money, allowing anyone to live a comfortable life without ever having to work again... but all this talk of private jets and lambos is exactly why you see people who hit $50 million lottery jackpots and they end up dirt poor within 10 years.

It can be any of: stock replacement, dollar replacement, gold replacement, lottery ticket replacement, and of course it is a guaranteed future lambo.  
That's the magic of Bitcoin!  It can be whatever you want it to be, if you just BELIEVE hard enough!  WooooO!!!

For most people sitting on the sideline of Bitcoin, the problem isn't steadfast belief the price will tank but rather just extreme fear (completely justified by past events) of the incredible uncertainty surrounding bitcoin's day to day price.  
Maybe it'll crash, maybe it'll skyrocket.  
Working from that perspective it doesn't make sense to hold it either short or long, but rather just avoid it altogether.

T minus one or two days until Bread loses their merchant status.
