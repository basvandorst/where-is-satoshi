If everybody of those 5000 who signed the petition would buy 0.001 BTC on GDAX and send it to their wallets Satoshi-by Satoshi, Coinbase would pay fees for 500000000 transactions!* They would either implement segwit fast, or let the mempool be clogged forever:)

Interesting, I was able to send BTC to family member and it was more efficient than sending money through bank due to our countries having different currencies. Seemed to work great for me, same day transfer.
It's always the right time to store your money, but as with everything, you need to plan your withdrawal - you shouldn't invest money (to anything that's not giving you a guarantee to not lose value, like savings account) if you know you'll need that money soon(ish).  If you know you don't need those money for five years, put it to BTC and when it's time to use them, you don't really need to care about it being"the best time"...

Let's say you want to find out in 1000 years because you don't care about money now, but want them for your descendants. Let's say there are 21 * 10^20 private keys with some nonzero amount in them. On average, you need to check 5 * 10^55 addresses to find a match. You have 1000 years to do it, or 3 * 10^10 seconds, which means you need to check more than 10^45 addresses every second.

So I imagine you buy at price $x and create a sell order for price $x+150? For what amount? When will you sell it it actually goes down? You can try your strategy virtually for let's say last month of gdax data and see where you'll get..
Let's say you'd buy 1 BTC at 10000 and it goes up, so you would sell at. 10150 for 150 profit and it goes up all the way to 19000... See what you lost there? Now it dips to 17000 so you buy again. And it goes down even more, to 10000.. So you've lost a lot of money, will you sell our buy more or keep it as is? It seems to me that your strategy is not very well thought-out..

You could have three outputs, you still don't know which pay of the first two is real transaction and what is change, and you would have extra change-for-fee which would be known. Or you could agree with the receiver that he pays for the fee, so the change would go to the normal transaction output and outsiders still don't know which one is your change address..
I agree preventing miners to take the max if the most important part, that's why a proposed to allow them to only take Mom of the previous block - so to influence that, they would need to a) mine two successive blocks and b) restrict the number of transactions in the first block so that they only take high fee transactions and don't fill up the block. I think it wouldn't be beneficial for them to do that.. But who knows..

I'm not saying it will hit 1 mil anytime soon, or ever. But if you believe in the technology and think global adoption will take place, just do some math. Let's say 1% of world would use BTC as main currency. Let's say to are evenly distributed across countries. So you have 760 mil people, each owning on average 0.03 Bitcoin. Quickly googling says average wealth of adult is little more than $50000. So that should put BTC to $1.6M.

Answer to what? Whether Bitcoin will survive? Nobody has answer to that, and if they claim they do, they are lying. 
As for after-crisis stocks, maybe they stayed away from stocks, but do you see where are the stocks now? The question really is if enough people will start using Bitcoin, and if Bitcoin can scale up to that usage by the time people are using it widely. That depends on the pace of adoption and development. It might go well, LN might be huge success and everybody will be happy. Or there might be some fatal flaw in Bitcoin that would make it useless. You should ask yourself if you believe this technology and this particular coin can thrive. If your answer is yes, you can invest in it. If no, stay away from it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:50:51
I don't think so, but yes, some people think it's much more likely for cheap coin to go up 50% than expensive one. And if lot of people think so, the invest in cheap coins so they increase value of them, so it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy...

In summer, tomatoes right out of the plant, already got from the sun are delicious. (This might be also classified as fruit not vegetable.. Not sure) Or peas, also raw.  (Which is probably also not vegetable, but I'll assume you care about plant based food,, not just vegetables) or sweet corn, baked.

It depends on your definition. If investment is something you might or might not earn you money, then both gold and Bitcoin (and art) can be considered investment. If your definition is singing that returns you money even if you don't sell it (like stocks with dividends, real estate with rents..) then neither Bitcoin nor gold is an investment. I think some of his points are valid, you don't really want to have majority of your assets in speculative investment, but I disagree it's bad to have some small portion in this, especially if you believe in the technology and think Bitcoin as first mover has actually an advantage..

I agree LN by itself doesn't scale to large adoption &amp; frequent micro/nano payments. It opens up a pretty good options though, and can be thought as a part of a bigger picture.
At the current level of adoption, however, I believe it will reduce the fees significantly on chain..

You got me thinking:)  would it be possible to create (through soft fork) some mechanism to have variable fee in the transaction? Like you say max fee you are willing to pay is XXX BTC, you provide enough inputs to cover that. The miner can put any fee on it, as long as it is less or equal to minimum explicit fee in the previous block.(and sends the rest to pre-specified change address) Not sure how to behave when everybody would use this variable fees do there would be no explicit fee in the last block, but I guess that is solvable...

I think this is underestimation. Let's say you dig holes of size 0.5m^2, and you can dig one hole per day (you need to rest, after all). Let's assume there is exactly one treasure hidden in the whole world. It would take you 10^15 days in expected case to find it. That's 10^12 years. 
On the other hand, to win in "Bitcoin lottery", you'd need to find out private key of one of 8bln potential Bitcoin users (=world population) let's say you can check 1 bln of keys per day. It would take you 10^58 days, or 10^55 years to find a key of another person. 
I'm sure I have some words in the computations/assumptions, but overall order of magnitude is way more than million.

It can definitely happen that there will be a better implementation someday. Bitcoin has a first move advantage and lot of bright mind working on it, so if there is a competitor to Bitcoin is quite likely they'd adopt the good parts to Bitcoin protocol. (Privies there really are good parts)
Stable coin (relative to USD) is not very compelling to me. You don't want a central bank to print money freely, and I dunt see how stable coin would be censorship resistant (but that might be just me)

Either you are in for the long run and, if you followed the rules and didn't put in more than you can afford to lose, you are fine.
Or you day trade, and then it doesn't make much sense to hold your assets in crypto as you cannot influence it while you are gone. (Hodling is better in that sense, you don't need to watch it even fit days)
Or you are panic selling on every "crash", then holding your coins while off the grid will actually do you good, as you wouldn't need to worry as you cannot influence it, and you would be probably more profitable anyways:)

Yes there is an advantage to own your coins - you actually own then and no one can seize then from a third party (Robinhood hacked? You don't care. Robinhood bankrupt? You don't care...)
You don't know if they are on fractional reserve, you don't know when government freezes them. You are not investing in Bitcoin, you are investing in Bitcoin like instrument, and there is no guarantee it will match Bitcoin performance.

Depends on the wallet. If you use HD wallet, you will get new address generated every time you receive funds. Now that you can still use the old address and you will receive the coins just fine. It's just not advised to reuse for privacy/security reasons. 
My understanding is that you can use just one address for everything if your wallet allowed it, but I never bother to do that and do research on how to set this up. (Some wallets have option to use manual address that you generate, but like I said, I've never tried it.)
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:25:55

Bitcoin is currently not practical for such small amounts (not that you would get rich from 1 pound anyways..) of you just want to get the feel of crypto currency, PM me with your litecoin address I can send you some small amount.

1. You can recover from your seed to any bip39 compliant wallet
2. It's safer because your private key never leaves the device, so any malware you have could potentially just change the transaction you are about to make, but then of course you would notice when confirming the transaction on your ledger nano screen
3. Easy if you don't double check everything. But that's true for any wallet at this point (I've heard of malwares that change your clipboard to contain different address when it detects you are trying to copy Bitcoin address..)
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:48:31
And even if you mine, difficulty gets adjusted every two weeks so you wouldn't help for too long..
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:27:47

@_date: 2017-12-06 12:05:35
You mean locked down permanently? No, who would even want such a wallet?
Paper wallet is essentially a pair of public (address) and private key. You can store public key online and use it to add funds to your wallet, even if the paper wallet is buried on your backyard. You can sell from it only using private key (and it's recommended to not reuse the wallet again, so every time you use your private key, you should generate a new one).
Make sure nobody else has access to your private key. That involves any malware sitting in your PC, out somebody listening to your WiFi connection when you try to print your wallet with WiFi printer, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:29:16
What's your fee? Mempool is getting emptier and emptier, you might soon see it confirmed 
Not sure if ledger allows RBF..
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:50:05
It's unprocessed transaction at given time, colored (and ordered) by fee. You can see that at one point a lot of new transaction were submitted with higher fees than before, so much that miners couldn't process then all.. After some time, miners processed more transactions than created and the mempool cleared a bit.
@_date: 2019-07-11 13:31:08

What do you mean by use? "Your" bitcoins on exchange are stored in the exchange's address, not yours. You only own them in the sense that exchange will send that amount to an address of your choice of you tell it to do so, but if anything bad happens to the exchange, you might never see your coins again. Use wallets for which you have control of your private keys.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:58:44
Yes, spamming the network is expensive. Don't do it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:45:11
Will my understanding is that outputs don't contribute that much to total transaction size so you wouldn't save much then? For one input two output transaction of 250 bytes you would save what, 24 bytes?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:28:04
Transaction needs to spend whole input minus fees. Everything that is not explicitly spend in the output is considered a fee, hence of you want to send 1btc and your utxo is 10btc, you need to send 9-fee as change to address owned by you. It's not wise to reuse addresses, so your wallet generates a new one for you, typically..
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:00:13
Yeah sure, it's dead.. +70% this month, time to jump the ship, it was supposed to be 40k by now..
Fees are high right now, so for short term I guess using another coin for payments is wise, but bcash? I don't know about that..
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:37:16
There are 2048 weird in the list so the total sieve is 2048^24.  If somebody know 12 words, the side is reduced to 2048^12 which is still large enough. Even if somebody knew 2/3 of your words, 2048^8 is large enough for you to be safe..
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:57:32
Don't really understand this.. creating 20-30 Sat/B transactions will not increase the fee when the currently mined transactions have fees in 200-300 range. It will just make mempool look larger, but anybody willing to pay more than 30 sat is not affected, or am I missing something?
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:25:39
When you do your research and actually understand what you are getting in to? (And then DCA, su dunt get in all at once)

My first thought would be: citation needed.
If you don't back up your claims, people shouldn't believe you. Like when some people here say it's impossible to transact with less than $40 fee.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:53:06

@_date: 2017-12-11 14:26:03
More confirmation = more blocks on top of your transaction = more proof of work involved = harder to change the transaction. After 6 blocks it's considered immutable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:05:06
Good strategy. If you go one step further and use gdax instead of coinbase (same company &amp; login, different interface) you can buy without fees (or 0.25% if you do market order) and withdraw without fees (quite a deal on current Bitcoin fees)

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:34:46
Option 1: Buy hardware wallet/ create bip39 seed,, remember the seed. Nobody will steal it from you unless you tell then. Con: you can forget it.
Option 2: sir your seed in physical safe, possibly monitored.
Option 3: store every word from the seed in separate safes
Also you can create multiple wallets/seeds, sir then in different places and divide your bitcoins equally. If a thief can get hold of one wallet, you wouldn't lose all of it...

@_date: 2017-12-08 13:42:32
Currently yes as the mempool is congested. Transfer it to gdax and send for free from there.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:59:11
No, dollar should still be $10... But if you write 10€ every day, it's easy to do that mistake.. like suppose you have never seen 10€ written anywhere. Wouldn't you be compelled to write it as €10?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:28:51
Gdax sent you BTC from one of their wallets. It doesn't have the exact amount, so the change (being more than you get) goes back to their wallet.
You shouldn't see fee being taken from your amount when withdrawing from gdax, they claim 0 fees. I tried that a while ago, transferred $6; worth of BTC for fun, the transaction has $3 in fees but they paid it, I've got the whole $6..
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:12:36

So you want user friendly and mobile, or best price for your BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:49:20
Does your address start with 1 or 3?
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:05:24
No. Fees go up with mempool congestion (you cannot really influence this one, assist for waiting fur better time to transact) and size of transaction - depends on number of UTXO you use as input and number of outputs and segwit: usually you cannot influence much the binder of outputs, you can somehow influence number of inputs, by thinking ahead and not sending very small amounts to your address and then spending them all at once. You can control segwit, and this reduces the transaction size as some pay off the transaction can be send in witness area..
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:23:28

Why would this be implemented in the core infrastructure? If some country wants to pay it's citizens fixed income, they can do so if they correct address of their citizens.

Yes, you are probably right. I've never used blockchain.info wallet, but doing a quick Google search it looks like it's indeed one address, but you can enable HD functionality there as well (HD=hierarchical deterministic, that's what other wallets do for generating new addresses)

I think merchants could accept such amount even with 0 confirmations, it would be pretty safe if the fee is high enough.. then you'd see similar speed...(or soon with lightning)
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:21:54
Unrelated to the question, but censoring couple of characters from the address doesn't help you much, anyone who would want it, can find it on blockchain explorer..

Ok regarding the whole economy, I understand what you mean by never change now... But I doubt this will ever happen. It would mean every person, every nation, agree Bitcoin is the only currency. Then everything would be denominated in BTC, but this is not the current state, as we are nowhere near 1% adoption..

I've used mycelium and coinomi (but I've heard some complaints for the latter, never had any problems myself though). Other popular options are electrum and bread wallet.

Just tried to log in to GDAX on mobile. Works perfectly.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:00:19
My understanding is that you can create limit buy order on higher than market price, but you will pay takers fee, and you need to uncheck "post only" in advanced settings. This will essentially fill as market order up to your limit price and then the rest will be like normal limit order. So let's say somebody wants to buy 10000BTC The order book says you can buy 8700BTC for that price, so you will fill your order partially, and the rest will be as limit orders at 20000 for 1300BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:48:48
Use GDAX, same company, no fees from coinbase to gdax nor from gdax to any address...

If I understand your pripísal correctly, you couldn't use an unconfirmed input as it wasn't yet included in any block, so things like CPFP wouldn't work.

Depends on when you bought $4 of bitcoins.

It's not bad for Bitcoin and isn't bad per se, it's just that you will likely loose money doing it if you don't know what you are doing (and sometimes even if you do.. Or think you do)
It's more gambling unless you have huge amount of money so you can manipulate the market, or extra knowledge only a handful of people in the market has, or great intuition so you know what the market will do next...
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:21:08
Usd is not the only currency. In some states, Bitcoin is actually more stable than local currency. Just saying..
It can fail, it can succeed. Who knows? If you don't believe in it, don't buy. (Or buy as situation and sell for higher price but make sure you are aware this is a gamble)
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:07:17
As already said here, currently we are in the middle of some kind of extreme, so maybe it's wise to wait a bit before buying. Or better yet, use dollar cost averaging and buy say $1000 every Monday for the next 20 weeks.
How to buy depends on your location, and I don't have any knowledge of what is available on Canada. If you can/will use coinbase, make sure you register to gdax and don't pay so much in fees..
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:32:41
Similar to stocks.. Will you could say so, but unlike stocks this is not tired to success of a company, doesn't pay dividends (if you don't count forks), you can hold a fraction of a coin, and it's not taxable in the same way as stocks (at least not in every country)
Investing is highly specifics, you could earn twice as much in week, you could lose half in same timeframe, and then it could not move significantly for years. Don't invest if you want quick gain but are not prepared to loose anything. Invest if you believe in the technology.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:29:42
I've used mycelium in transition period between exchange and hardware wallet (at the time when I thought I don't need hardware wallet) and I was satisfied with it. Seemed pretty easy to use for beginner as well..
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:21:46
1. Wait for LN to work and reduce fees, or
2. Watch the mempool and transaction when it's not or less empty, or
3. Use other coins that have better fees currently, like litecoin
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:09:51
False. The fees are high right now, but even in recent blocks there are transactions where input is worth ~$40. Not saying you can buy much, but saying it's immovable is simply false.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:33:17
Yes that's my understanding also. Is say current surge in Bitcoin price is not talked to the forks...
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:16:53
It's theoretically divisible to any number of decimal places (even though now it's 8), but you can be sure when you own 1000000BTC, the cannot be more than 20 other people Peking as much or more. So if you own x% of all bitcoins now, you can be sure it doesn't change (unless you spend them) in future when they are divisible in say 20 decimal places.That's where scarcity comes from.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:10:17
Great that you are asking questions before investing! Having only small amount to invest means you need to pay attention to fees. If you search this subreddit, you'll find some type how to save on fees by using gdax instead of coinbase for example.
I think you should diversify, if you don't have better understanding, I think it's good idea to invest in to x coins by market cap, so with $100 you could buy $75 of BTC and $25 of ETH. Beware that $75 in BTC is low enough to be significantly reduces by fees when transacting, so ideally move it directly from the exchange to segwit enabled cold storage.
If you are hoping for high returns in months, you might be disappointed. For long term, it's the question where Bitcoin succeeds as "future money" or not. Read about the technology and decide yourself if you believe it.
Don't try to day trade especially with such a low budget. You will more likely loose your money than not.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:03:23
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:55:38
Yes, in Europe currencies are written that way, 10€ for example..
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:40:45
Well you only bought ~0.1 BTC so the price difference isn't 200 but 20. So paying 36 in fees makes you lose money even when you earned 20 on the price. And don't forget to account for taxes..
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:31:58
Depends what you want to do with it. You can check how much you've got at blockchain.info, type your address there (the one beginning with 1 or 3) and you will see the balance. If you want to cash it out, create an account on exchange and use some wallet that allows importing private keys to send BTC to the exchange, sell, profit. If you want to hold, and the amount is large enough, it might be worth checking hardware wallets, then transfer it there. If you trust your boss you can even key it in the paper wallet you received until you decide what to do.
Edit: alternatively, you can find out somebody who is willing to buy it from you off exchange, buy you need to trust that person, so I don't know how feasible it is for you to do..
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:15:15
Value of Bitcoin and interest rate of return are not comparable. What you could compare is value of Bitcoin and value of eur (none of these will be ever negative, zero in the worst case) and interest rate of Euro and Bitcoin. The interest rate is the change of your euro/BTC amount when you hold it in Bank. Closest to bank for Bitcoin are exchanges, so you could say current rate is 0% it could be negative though, but I doubt anybody would hold their BTC in such a bank/exchange
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:40
Thanks, I stand corrected, 1000% a year is 0.66% a day give or take..(technically still less than 3% ;) ). Anyways I wouldn't say the growth will be linear.. It will necessarily slow down, but for early years (I still believe we are early) 1000% a year seems ok, while 31% a day like like pump &amp; dump in progress...

AMA? Well then.. What's your private key?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:22:44
Best are hardware wallets, but unless you have more than $1000 in bitcoins it's overkill (they cost around 100 dollars)
Next, paper wallets, but do your research on how to securely generate them
Then some hot wallets on mobile/Pc, e.g. mycelium, coinomi, electrum.
Make sure you (and only you) have your private keys. What you buy on exchange is not really yours until you move it to wallet that you own..
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:07:36
No I'm bullish on that metric. You will see more and more such articles.

I think unconfirmed transactions can only affect gdax price in such way that somebody sends his BTC to gdax and plans to sell. But it's hard to detect which transactions are of such type, which are withdrawals from gdax for already finished years, and which have nothing to do with gdax at all...
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:55:11
Interesting, when I buy $50 worth of bitcoins, I'll get the same amount to my wallet. I guess the difference is in the research, or you are just trolling.

@_date: 2017-12-17 22:03:42
AFAIK, coinomi doesn't support segwit yet, so it will not be very cheap. What I'd do is to check the state of mempool, pick a fee that seems good enough, and direct coinomi to use that fee in settings-&gt;transaction fees. Beware that fees are usually in SAT/byte but coinomi uses SAT/kilobyte so you need to convert that (times 1000)
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:05:41
a) it isn't written in your document
b) it explains the BTC part, not BCH
Honestly I'd be fine with such explanation for start, if it was in the document.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:46:28
Not an error. Yes, something can be done: use gdax
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:22:07
If you don't need your coins, then yes, you don't need to transfer it to segwit now. But then again, you shouldn't complain about high fees of you don't need to do any transactions.
If you do need to do transactions on regular basis, you can transfer everything to segwit address you own (maybe with lower fee/priority as you don't need it to be confirmed in the next block) and then you will benefit from the fact that witness data is counted as 1/4 of base data when you compute weight of transaction. (And therefore fee)
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:36:22
You are aware of the fact that when one person buys x BTC somebody else has to sell x BTC right? That other guy just got $ for his BTC and can soend it, similarly as you would pay with a brick of gold in a store, but rather trade that gold for dollars first. So there is an option to soend BTC and people do it and it didn't crash yet, so your theory is wrong.

But you still need the (bit)coins to leave your old address and arrive at the new address, onchain. You'll inevitably pay a fee for those transactions..

Hardware wallet is safe than desktop/mobile. Don't use web wallets where you don't control your keys (like exchanges) unless necessary (for a short time when you want to trade)
Pay attention to what you do, if you see anything suspicious in your phone/of, stop using any wallets and investigate..
I've been using Coinomi, Mycelium and Samurai on mobile, Bitcoin Core, Wasabi on desktop. Never had problem with any, but I like Samurai and Wasabi (with local full node) the most currently.

If you are afraid you might sell, you can:
- send all you own with low fee transaction.. The mempool will clear out only after the storm, so you cannot spend in the meantime
- reset your hardware wallet. When you are tempted to sell, you need to type in your seed again which gives you some time to think:)
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:43:37
That's why it's important for everybody to run their own full node!
@_date: 2019-06-03 11:19:36
I think it really depends on your personality/financial situation/plans with the coins..
If you are so rich you wouldn't notice losing $100k, you don't need a hardware wallet at this point. If you want to trade you don't want extra latency coming from transferring to hardware wallet and back..
I'm comfortable having in a hot wallet (or exchange) as much as I'd be comfortable having in cash in my physical wallet. If you worry and need to check your wallet constantly to check if the coins are still there, use hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:58:31
So you are not following your strategy, just your guts:) which is ok, but not what you've said you'd do
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:21:37
I actually meant decentralized:D
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:40:48
No, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting the max amount on hot wallet depends on your circumstances. I wouldn't buy hardware wallet for $500 but would for $5000.  If you are rich you probably don't care about the cost of the wallet (maybe more on your time you need to spend researching which one is reliable).. That being said, I can imagine some people being fine having $100k on an exchange/hot wallet and rest in cold wallet, yes. I've scenario would be when you want to sell in the next days. And again here it depends on each individual of they would risk $100k or would rather proceed in increments of $10k or so..
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:30:05
Depending on how much you have, buy a hardware wallet or install a reputable desktop wallet on your computer. Ideally run a full node (it's easier than it looks like)

To sell BTC for "BTC payment coin" you'd need an onchain transaction (somebody needs to buy it), ditto for buying BTC back. Just use lightning...

Why not both?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:03:13
Didn't you perhaps use seed + passphrase?

And the masterplan is then to launch Bitcoin Cash Plus Core which will replace both, has 42 m coins, both segwit and nosegwit,  and everybody is happy with it?
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:10:13
Most Wallets don't allow that, no? (Except for RBF feature)

Yes, Bitcoin is useless for everyday payments in 2019 if you don't know how to set up lightning node, or can time your transactions. This week improve in cold of years. If you don't see it/don't believe it,  don't hold Bitcoin.
That being said, none of the other crypto currencies is good enough as money, so there is no better solution.

Mortgage your house, buy Libra with everything (expecting it's not a stable cob but will grow), wait until interest from mortgage eats your wealth?

This is next level of FUD, you doubt China, you doubt ban, and you doubt China again.

How can you be a hodler if you don't hodl anymore?

Accidentally found, as in somebody generated private key to your address by random? Do you know how improvable this is? Most likely, you generated it from infected computer/website and it got stolen..

So 117647000 is better to describe the price?
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:56:05
Might be smart, but definitely not hodlers:)

So you are no longer holder.

You call him out for ad hominem attack yet you do the same...
