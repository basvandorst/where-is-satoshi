They are not showing up in the blockchain for one or another weird reason...
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:51:19
Sorry, just freaking out (A). I am running arround with my hands in my face, screaming, crying, dont want to lose them!3
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:08:00
Why can i lose coins? I dont understand how that could happen.
I must say i have not deleted the wallet.dat after receiving coins, only after sending a couple times. But nothing serious.
I just made another transaction to the same addres, which isnt showing up in the blockchain. Ill just see and wait what happens.
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:17:57
That doesnt mean gox still decides the market... So yeah its important what the news will say.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:08:17
I already tried that, i wrote this in the other thread:
"Ok, god thank you! So no matter what happens, i will still have the coins!
Ill sit and wait what happens with the confirmation. This was a hard lesson.
What can i do if the transaction doesn't confirm? I made another transaction an hour ago, from and to the exact same address, but this is not showing up in the blockchain.
I can try to send it again when it deosnt get confirmed after 24 hours or so?"
Thx again! I highly appreciate your effort and help!

The last transaction (which isnt being confirmed) was send from that change address correct? So i could conclude that my wallet contains that address? Even that i deleted the wallet.dat file after that transaction of 0.0625?
So when blockchain removes it because of not confirming, i sill possess those coins?
How can i restart bitcoin qt wallet? Delete and resync the whole blockchain?

The only thing you can do against this is ride the waves. Buy bitcoins as cheap as possible at gox. And hopefully when they do enable withdrawals, the price will explode.
Even when they enable USD withdraw, BTC withdraw will be much faster. Resulting in skyrocketing. However i think these btc will end up on other exchanges. So be carefull with holding them on other exchanges, price could rally up and plumit right after..
This is the huge problem with no regulations.. companys can do this and get away with it.
However if they do are trading with inside information, which is illegal anyway. They can be prosecuted for doing that.

Does it has the public and private key already in them?
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:15:06
So i could try and send the bitcoins to a whole new address? Or better sit and wait?
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:50:35
it isnt that stupid to gradually let the withdrawals be processed.. or else there will be a run on the bitcoins, mtgox will collapse and a lot of people lose their money
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:48:58
So can you confirm this? 
So i still have all the private keys of my 100 public keys? I am freaking out :( I did not know about change addresses...
God i feel dumb!!
Really thx for your effort!

Yes, ddos makes the website go offline. No hacking.. Only malleability could be exploited but with the withdraw hold it shouldnt be a problem..
Annoying it is!

Lol typo for sure.. Ceo and founder of bitcoininstant
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:09:36
this is no good news, prepare for a crash. Its imminent
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:50:16
Ok, so when i replace my wallet.dat file with an older backed up wallet.dat file. I still have 100% access to my coins?
See this for more info: 
Thx in advance!

You could go to the gox site and keep hitting F5. Very effective method imo.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:22:56
Pfoeh, my heartbeat is calming down a bit (A)
But by now i think i made 3 transactions or so, all not confirming. It doesnt hurt when i make another transaction?
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:29:02
Thank you, i tried this, result: Error Pushing. Transaction already exists
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:53:03
As I am a Dutchie, I like this. However his website is n00b as hell. Don't know if I would trust such website (A)
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:02:38
Ok, god thank you! So no matter what happens, i will still have the coins!

I really think the reason why you posted this to justify your own thoughts. Stop speculating!

Transaction broadcast through 8 nodes. 12 active connections to the bitcoin network.

Firstly i would like to thank you for your effort yesterday, i panicked and was not thinking clear. I must have looked like a complete idiot!
After the dust settled i rethinked all the steps i did, the problems started when i did a transaction (prior to the one discussed here) which was not confirming either. I then saw that for some weird reason there was no fee included (Bitcoin QT did this automatic). I then saw the change address, which i never heard of before. I thought i was a victim of malware so i wanted to send all the bitcoins to a new address with fee, this one did show on the blockchain and was the transaction discussed here. Because of the transactions not showing up in the blockchain, i thought they did not matter...
Nothing was confirming, only this last transaction was in the blockchain and the transactions i made after these all did not show. I then went to bed hoping today would be a day to celebrate.
And yes! The initial transaction send without fee went through, all the other transactions disappeared fromt the blockchain, making this problem solved.
I wanted to thank you and keep you posted so you know what happened, it is the least i can do.
Thank you!
