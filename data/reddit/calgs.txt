Because all the people that got into BTC in the past 3 weeks are riding losses, and all they want to do is dump as soon as it gets back to their buy in price.
They heard nothing but xx0% gains, but have only had losses. Scares em away

Soon you will learn that the average person doesn't care about "muh decentralization" they want a fast, low cost transaction method. Vitalik is not going to put down some banhammer one day and freeze everyone's ETH, it's as decentralized as it needs to be while still working as intended.

Yet all this means nothing to the average person. And the average person is the one who ends up needing to adopt a coin as a currency, store of value, etc. BTC fails miserably at the most basic use cases for the average person. Hence its current demise.

These types of internal disputes is why everyone in altcoins laugh our asses off at your guys' inefficiency.

Funny how the only "good" thing bitcoin has is its dev team, when its biggest problem is lack of sufficient software updates and even basic communication that isn't some buzzword filled LN test video
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:44:03
Or consider using a coin that isn't ridden with ridiculous fees and a dev team that says LN is "almost ready" every month?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:07
Surprise! Bitcoin does not work at all for its intended use. 
I am 90% in on BTC, but as an investment. It is objectively garbage for use as a currency and should not be treated as such until it works as such (hopefully LN). Or else people will be immediately turned off the idea of BTC being used as a currency due to tx fees, wait times, etc.

Because living in complete anarchy with no roads or public services is something people want, right??
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:29:07
I’m sorry but you are delusional. Most people know about crypto and most think it is a sham. Transferring fiat currency is too easy for crypto to ever take hold. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:41:05
You should set up your own payment network then.

You realize this is what built our economy? If people gained value by hoarding money away (deflation), no one would spend and the economy would collapse. An inflationary currency encourages economic activity and to put capital to work instead of letting inflation wither away on it.

Its funny you think it will ever go above 20k again. I will personally give you reddit gold if this happens in the next 3 years.

Didn’t know this was an environmental topic. But if we’re getting into that, how great is the mass energy/computing power bitcoin mining uses to solve made up math problems?
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:19:37
Or you could just use a Visa? Instant, fee-less (to the consumer) transactions. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:12:47
This is fair. Although that would not warrant $20T flowing into the cryptocurrency market. 
In my opinion, fiat currency is this “really good” medium of exchange you speak of anyway. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:46:26
I’ll give ya one example of how bitcoin is not technologically perfect: 
The transparency of the blockchain means every time you make a transaction or get the public address of someone, you can see their entire wallet worth in btc, as well as the past transactions they made, both who with and how much. How’d you like your grocery store clerk to know you have 600 btc in the wallet..
One example how it’s not economically perfect: 
Limited supply means it’s deflationary. This means there is no incentive to spend instead there is incentive to save. This is the opposite of what fuels an economy.. Spending. 
It’s not all sunshine and rainbows my friend. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:30:37
What reasons lead you to have no doubt about this? I would say I have no doubt that it will not be the “future currency”. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:11:13
The difference is that the $20T invested in the stock market allows the worlds largest companies to operate, and continue to create the necessities we take for granted today. $20T in the crypto market would not aid crypto projects in replacing the producers of the worlds food, energy, transportation etc. It’s simply not worth anywhere near that 
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:58:52
This is correct. Inflation is needed to fuel the economy set up in all western countries currently. This is the main reason bitcoin will never succeed as being the main currency of any western civilization. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 01:39:20
You’re gonna lose a lot of money buddy. Bitcoin is not even close to technologically perfect. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:57:51
Orchestrated dump? Or an asset went up 2000% in one year and people began taking profits, chain reacting to an all out dump by the 95% of people in bitcoin purely to speculate on the price. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:38:02
An economy where everyone “hodls” bitcoin is not an economy i’d like to live in. Any currency that is used to “seek growth” is a terrible currency and will cause the prosperous economy and world we live in right now to collapse. 
Just try *thinking* for a second. Maybe mix in a first year university economics class while you’re at it. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 00:12:44
Uhh.. Yes. 
Bitcoin does not produce any physical items that have intrinsic value. Like food. And energy for heating homes. (In fact it sucks up energy to solve made up math problems, genius!) 
@_date: 2018-06-19 16:35:12
If bitcoin were the currency for global trade the worldwide economy would collapse. Transaction fees would skyrocket and fraud would run rampant. There would be no chargebacks or ability to control transactions once they go through. It’s not a better money. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:55:17
This is a case for Bitcoin as a store of value? Not for use as a currency. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 00:35:11
The comment you initially replied to entertained the idea of crypto market cap reaching 20 trillion. Be it crypto or bitcoin, the results of this would be devastating to the economy. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 23:59:58
The entire world economy would collapse, and mass famine, disease, and anarchy would ensue. It would be horrid. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:40:17
Because bitcoin is still wildly overvalued. If you are buying more now, I feel bad for you. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:34:10
Speculating? He has the records of tether issuance and buys at times that bitcoin was testing support levels. 
The other 8 pumps of bitcoin didn’t involve a 100b+ increase in market cap. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:13:42
Obviously people will spend on consumer staples. That’s a given. It’s the discretionary spending that will tank if a deflationary currency is in use. Discretionary spending drives a very large portion of the economy, and without it, the economy would entirely collapse. This is unarguable and it is basic economics that a currency in use needs to be INflationary. 
All I was arguing is against OPs statement that bitcoin is economically and technologically perfect. Which it is far from. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:00:06
&amp; should you still own those stocks you took a hit on in 2008, you’d be up over 100% since then. More if you purchased in 2008-2009 as well. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:20:44
Your reason for economic perfection sounds a lot like a reason for technological perfection. I’m not sure you know what the economic implications of widespread bitcoin use would be. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:33:06
You ain’t feeding yourself then either ����
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:35:53
Misery? What are you talking about.. We live in the most prosperous time ever. All due to the thriving economy fuelled by an inflationary currency. If you can’t succeed in this capitalist system then you are just of lower intelligence than those that can. Try to provide some value to society instead of praying for some scamcoin to make you rich and an early adopter of a “new financial system”.

This post about this study needs to be higher. People should know the forces that went into such a big bubble.

Why do that when you can have one wallet full of Monero, no need for fumbling with multiple keys and potentially centralized holding centers? Isn't the point of all this to streamline financials and relinquish the need for all the checks and balances?
Sweet summer child.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:56:06
This the main reason bitcoin will never succeed as a currency. I can't help but see the situation where a checkout clerk at the grocery store sees your XXX+ bitcoin wallet and subsequently plots a kidnapping to torture your private keys out of you. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:53:39
Why not just be using Monero the entire time then?
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:40:28
Why are you comparing this to a traditional banking system? Isn't the point to get away from that? Make it easier for people to control their own finances without the need for multiple accounts.
Cashier can't see my checking account balance either anyway so your point is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:41:49
They own Instagram and WhatsApp... WhatsApp isn’t even fully monetized yet. So there’s that. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:38:07
So your reason for him is “So you contribute to adoption” lol. Bitcoin will only ever be used as a novelty. There are no real benefits to the average consumer in using crypto on a day to day basis.  “crypto will grow with or without your participation” is what all the (bag)hodlers say when people criticize bitcoin, when the reality is you need all the people you can get. Crypto has been declining in user base, adoption, and price since Jan. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:41:10
Because it’s so divisible?? The dollar is as divisible as it needs to be and it doesn’t come with the problems of volatility, lack of insurance, transaction fees, difficulty of use.. I could go on. Bitcoin can never become a mainstream way to pay for goods and services period.
