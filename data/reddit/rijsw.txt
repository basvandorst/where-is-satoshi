Must be adware. I've never seen anything good on a reseller store.

Let me start with directing you to [google](
I can vouch for  but you are going to want to find a vendor that accepts your money and that you trust.
Just a reminder, you will be giving your money away. Only if it all works; the wallet is legit; you gave the vendor the right bitcoin-address; the vendor is honest: you will be able to find the bitcoin-transaction on the blockchain and call yourself a bitcoin owner. Your bitcoin-adress, for which only you know the private key, will be in the records of owning X amount of bitcoin.

You install a bitcoin wallet and go to a bitcoin vendor: You pay the vendor money, so he transfers bitcoin in your wallet.
Now your wallet is not restricted to only recieve bitcoins from that vender. Other people with wallets can transact bitcoins to other people's wallets. Whether you expect something in return or are transacting the bitcoin out of love, that is what makes the transaction a payment.
So some stores have their wallet address public, you first confirm with the store what you would like to get and how much bitcoin he wants from you. Then when you commit the transaction, you've payed with bitcoin.

Can you quantify the High/Medium/Lows? I get that this is all uncertain, but I recommend not adding another layer of uncertainty by using vague words:
Is a *medium* probability something like 10-40%? In that case you'd expect half of the high probability attacks to occur during the 10year period. Which is interesting.
From a podcast, where they talked about Kennedy launching an invasion to depose Castro in April ’61:
