i want more stuff like this to catch on. it would be cool to be able to do freelance sysadmin work for btc. write some ansible playbooks... automate a deployment... write up some documentation, then get paid in btc, that sounds great.

maybe an exclusive requirement for success but it would greatly help if problems like this could be solved for the average user.

Sent them ID and complied with KYC. Middle name was one letter at bank fully spelled in Coinbase.

I also played the stupid game and sent them scans of my ID so it’s not like I wasn’t trying to comply with KYC bullshit

The middle name on the bank account is one letter and I messed up and put the full middle name in Coinbase. Fuck me right?

I already opened a support ticket my bad if I came here to vent. This is also something a bank could have resolved within a day or two... it’s been a week and a half no reply other than the canned high volume were slammed don’t hate us bs.

Whatever man I don’t hop on the internet for lectures... look at how I titled my post, do you really think I am going to respond to reason here? I don’t give a fuck about Coinbase or how they end up looking on the internet... I just want the coins back.
Jesus are you not allowed to get mad about your money these days? Is everyone walking around ultra chill and not worrying about it? Fuck maybe I need therapy...
