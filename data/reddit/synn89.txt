I think the ultimate fix will be to build better identity solutions. There is need to prove identity for various circumstances, but the current situation is showing the traditional system's weaknesses in various ways.
I'm the only person in the world that can send bitcoin from my wallet. If the government issued crypto wallets instead of social security numbers my identity could easily be proven via "signing" with my wallet by sending a small amount of coin. W-2 wages could also be sent to this wallet and that'd make tax evasion a lot harder as well. 
Not sure how long the road towards governments embracing blockchain will be though. Many seem very determined to keep their heads stuck up their arses.

That's pretty reasonable and in fact I did switch all my savings from dollars to crypto. For me I feel like it's safer there and I earn a higher return on it.
One founder for a coin I like has the idea that in the future it'll be very easy to swap crypto coins around on the fly(payment processors can just DEX from one coin to another), so it might be likely people eventually use a currency that aligns with their personal beliefs. So in the future if you want X or Y you can "vote" by just using a crypto with ties to those ideals and projects.

The government would hold details associated with the key data. You could show up at the sheriff's office, claim you're me, sheriff would have deeper access to the federal blockchain data that would hold photo and other information(driver's license). You'd be arrested on the spot.
I'd then go to the DMV, be issued a new private key and my prior key would be de-activated. A new redirect entry on the blockchain would point all old contract history to my new key.
The reason for the blockchain use is security, immutable history and the ability to embed contract data on the chain with various levels of access for that block entry(on a loan the lender, myself and government could access that block's contract).

Not really. I don't think BTC needs to be the coin you use for payment at the grocery store. With the proper exchange system any coin could auto-xfer into what the vendor wants.
I think BTC is well suited as the reserve currency of the world and long term personal wealth storage. So something you move in and out of infrequently and typically in large sums.

The ledger is firewalled from your computer in a specific way so infections on your PC can't attack the keys on the ledger.
The issue with desktop PCs and servers is there's a lot of software on them so it's very hard to secure them. The Ledger has 1 very specific way of chatting with your desktop wallet/computer, so it's easier to lock down and keep that line of communication secure against attacks.
Your main risk with the hardware wallet is either losing your seed phrase, not securing that well, or falling victim to some sort of scam where someone gets you to hand over your seed phrase.

It's really just an issue that banks don't support BTC deposits yet. This will be how your average normal person works with Bitcoin in the future.
Outside of banks though, Bitcoin is superior to cash and gold. I can more easily break up my seed phrase and hide it/distribute it than I can with gold. I can even memorize it.
But I'd agree, that knowledge is the major issue.

There was, gold. And if you did international trade you'd always know how much a USD was worth against a British pound because both were measured in gold values.
Then WW1 happened, countries printed tons of cash to fund a financially unlimited war and after rather than correct the dollar values they just moved away from gold backing.

Yeah, it's not really "bitcoin is the internet" so much as distributed blockchain/crypto technology will be the future of trading value in the future.
The coke you buy in the soda machine will happen via blockchain. When you watch a late night host on the streaming service of the future(which replaces cable TV channels) your watching stats will go on a blockchain, that pays for an ad on a blockchain, that pays the show host directly to his wallet, after the "channel", ISP, show creator, and thousands of other people get their cut... all in real time thanks to crypto and blockchains which are secure and easily audit-able.
Our entire society runs on trading value around and blockchain/crypto will have as big an impact on that as the web did on information distribution.

And that $18 stock is what, $30 after a year? I bought NRG at $2 because they're rolling out smart contracts soon, their own DEX, a stable coin pegged to gold, created educational videos for crypto and are planning a vendor support rollout in economically hard hit areas like Venezuela so people in third world countries can have a stable currency. Basically they, and many others like them, are building the currency of tomorrow.
The price has gone up from $2 to over $6 and I also make 60% earnings from staking the coin I hold. So yeah, you can keep your AMD stock.

Let's say I live in Hong Kong. You're my financier in Paris France. I need you to do a couple things for me in France.
I can send you funds easily within minutes without any major fees, hassles, paperwork or permissions. Once I sent you those funds, I can verify you received them in the wallet.
I have an ex-wife there who expects 10k USD monthly. I can monitor her destination address and see that you've sent her that money each month. I can also monitor your wallet to make sure you're spending my funds on other things I ask you to and only that(like a local apartment, car, etc).
Consider I may have a setup like this in Moscow, New York, London, etc and I don't need to deal with local banks, or trusting the funds in your bank account, issues with moving funds between countries and local regulation. If my local person needs fiat they can deal with the conversion on their end themselves.

There's really no such thing as a static store of value. If I was a Brit in 2005 whether or not I kept my money in USD or pounds would either be a massive gain or loss in value compared to today.
The supply of BTC, at least, is stable. Compared to other currencies it's probably the safest bet over the next 10 years.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:11:58
I'd argue that you're really not buying the automobile, but the brand. The technology of BTC will shift and adapt in the future. And even if it doesn't do that well, it's very likely that we'll see it used as the back end(reserve) for superior front end technologies.
For a real world example consider IPv4 that the internet runs on. It's extremely flawed and was supposed to be replaced by IPv6. But instead it's been worked around(NAT) and continues to be in use with no end in sight.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:01:58
For me, part of what's left are alt coins that you can easily earn more free coin on. My main alt at the moment has a 60% return on staking. So even if it performs lower than BTC my overall growth can be higher.
The danger, of course, is keeping an eye on the coin to make sure it's still heading in a healthy direction(good marketing, good dev activity, etc).
But definitely more risk IMO compared to just holding BTC.

It's not like wealthy people have a lot of safe options for storing cash. FDIC only covers 250k, so where do you store 100 mil USD? Land is best, but freezes your cash. Stock market can crash, if you buy gold you gotta secure that, etc.
A good hardware wallet with your recovery key split and secured in banks doesn't seem like that bad of an alternative.

I agree, but I don't think it's as easy as most people think. Real estate has been a rich person buy up for several decades in many markets. So much so that they've pushed up prices in those areas to ridiculous rates. There's no guarantee that those prices won't all crash at some point. 
Part of the reason why BTC is doing well today is because the wealthy are moving into that vs land and stocks.
It's becoming an attractive alternative that I think will continue as people get used to using it. For example, you could create a new wallet and give it to your accountant, lawyer, etc and easily send funds to it, monitor the funds in that wallet, see what the BTC is spent on, etc.
It's fast, secure, audit-able, easily split up, easy to work with, international and more likely to retain value in uncertain times. There has to be care in use, but you have those same concerns with traditional assets(your prime "real estate" ends up being Florida swampland).

Move your assets off the device except for a very small amount. Reset the device. Input your recovery phrase and verify that your small amount of coin is there.
With Trezor there's a way to just verify the words without resetting the device. But personally I still did a manual reset/restore for peace of mind.

Personally I think program-ability will be king. We're kind of in the pre web 1.0 days of blockchain and just like people back in the AOL/Geocities days never would've envisioned Youtube/Google Maps on the internet, 20 years from now blockchain software is going to be insanely complex and everywhere.
So ease of programming, speed and scalability will be king. Ethereum is leading the pack on the programming support right now, but the future of scaling there is unsure. I kind of personally like Stellar in terms of speed/scale and it's seeing interesting use in several projects(Keybase.io) and seems to be easy to work with. It also has good anchor support and so on.
But I think that stuff is 5+ years off. Right now it's all investors/retail piling in and people wanting a safe currency. So Bitcoin is king and will be for several more years. And when that peters out and we get those blockchain killer apps in another coin, it's really anyone's guess what that coin will be.

I can't really recommend a personal software wallet, because I don't use them. I use  and basically recommend to get one of those to people as soon as possible. Outside of the trezor, I keep small amounts on my crypto.com account which has a nice phone app and a debit card. For me my trezor is like my bank account and my crypto.com mobile app is like carrying around cash.
If you wait til you're 18, just make your own Coinbase account. Basically what you need to do:
* Get your own personal bank account with your name and current address on it.
* Save all government mail and bills that's delivered to you in your name at your current address. You'll need this to verify your identify to Coinbase and other exchanges.
* Open a Coinbase account using the above to verify your identify.
Your Coinbase account can also act as your bitcoin wallet. But there's a saying "not your keys, not your coin". For holding small amounts Coinbase is a good safe route for a novice. But once the money there starts to pile up, buy a hardware wallet, **read all the instructions for it** and move your coin to that.
When you hold your coin in your own wallet no one can take it away from you.

I don't think he understands what a Ponzi is. What he may believe is that it's worthless, the people that got in early have pumped up the story of its worth and will basically cash out and make a ton of money before the whole thing collapses.
And in fact many cryptos are/were basically just that: exit scams. But Bitcoin has moved beyond that worry point as the coins are pretty well distributed, and have been for awhile now, with large institutional investors holding considerable sums of it.
So he's right to fear that many coins can be a scam, but Bitcoin has been around long enough and weathered enough peaks and crashes to basically prove itself legit. A real scam would've imploded and gone to zero after the 17k -&gt; 3k crash, yet here we are ready to push into new all time highs with more interest than ever by large investing firms.

I think you can pretty much assume that anywhere there's a "financial industry", there's fraud and BS schemes going on. This is why you'll see it in crypto too.
It's also why I believe that there's a lot of shadiness going on with exchanges and tether in particular. These industries just seem to attract the kind of people that don't think anything of a little fraud as long as it makes money.

Since you're involving your dad, I'd recommend coinbase. They've been around for awhile, are regulated/insured and look/are very legit. The site shouldn't come off as sketchy to your dad.
Basically give your dad some money. He'll create a coinbase account and attach his bank account to coinbase for transfers back and forth. He can then move money from his bank to coinbase.
Using that money he can buy bitcoin into a wallet on coinbase. That bitcoin can then be sent to your own personal wallet at home. 
To move that back into fiat(USD), you'd send your bitcoin to your dad's bitcoin wallet on coinbase. Once there, he can sell it for USD and transfer that USD back into his bank account.
There are other ways to convert bitcoin into cash. I have a debit card from crypto.com which lets me move BTC from my home wallet, to my wallet there and instantly sell into USD and put that onto my debit card with them. When you hit 18 you might look into them along with your own coinbase account.

The problem is the fiat, not the crypto. The fiat system is flawed, it only works with government/police intervention and when they choose not to/can't get involved, you're screwed. If I traded you ETH for BTC via a dex like airswap, a scam like this would be impossible. 
There are tons of international scams out there in regards to exploiting the flaws in fiat because government prosecution doesn't cross borders easily. Also it doesn't help that the rules regarding fiat(when is money in your account really there permanently?) is so variable and obscure it's easy to scam people.

A near zero inflation money isn't theoretical. That was the standard for most of human civilization and when there were problems it tending to be because governments or external influences inflated or destroyed the currency.
From the late 1800's to around WW1 we had a pretty stable gold backed dollar. This was a period of amazing industrial growth, the founding of our modern living standard, and more inventions per capita than what we experience today. The problem with it though was it depended on centralized control of the gold for issuing of notes and when WW1 broke out governments just printed new notes to create a monstrous war with no economic limits. The 1920's and beyond was about dealing with that money printing(FDR seizing private gold, dropping the gold standard entirely, the world moving to USD for the reserve).
Bitcoin has all the benefits of a gold backed note system, trusted, easily verified, easily broken into smaller units, easily transported, without the centralized control which invariably(if 2000 years of human history is any indicator) leads to its devaluation.
I personally view that as a good thing. I also feel that any country that doesn't back their currency on Bitcoin or another stable reserve will fail, just like countries that backed against silver failed in comparison to those that backed against gold.
