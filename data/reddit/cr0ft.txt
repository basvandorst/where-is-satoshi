Haven't you heard? That's not what Bitcoin is for. It's for rich people to stockpile wealth in. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:19:42
It's not. Haven't you heard? It's now exclusively for rich people to store their ill gotten gains in. Probably a good thing, with a 217000 transaction long queue and fees that average out to $25 per each of those transactions.

It's been quite a while since you got it from the Government. It originates in a privately owned bank they tacked the name "Federal" on for shits and giggles, and it's sold to the Government for "interest" when it is created.
Except the interest money is never created, so there is always more debt in the system than there is value. Ergo, Fiat money, ergo (partially) the on-going clusterfuck we call reality. 
Where Bitcoin is helping make things worse, not better, for that matter.

Personally, I still think bitcoin and any cryptocurrency is mostly bullshit. The blockchain tech itself may be useful, but really I don't think bitcoin contributes much, and makes possible some things that weren't before - like the explosion in ransomware, and I don't consider that positive.
Which is not to say I'm staying out of the money-making aspect of cryptocoins. As long as people think this is awesome, it will keep appreciating. Especially as the amount out there is finite. 
But really, the whole trading and divorcing "money" from "reality" is insanity. If we really wanted to get excited we should get excited over a social system that keeps track of our joint resources and ensures we use them sustainably, but bitcoin isn't helping with that, neither is normal currency or even our social system that's built on competition and insane levels of abstraction.
Bitcoin "has gone up" and can now be traded for tons of fiat currency, making people "rich". What changed in the real world for the people to get rich? Not a damned thing, the resources we had as a species are still the same, the manufacturing capacity we had was still the same, etc. 
And playing these fantasy games "up here" while ignoring reality... it's lunacy, really. Not even corporate stock is really connected to the actual value and resources of the company, it's more connected to ideas. While we, again, ignore the real world.

Mining isn't for the average person anymore. The raw power you need to do it means only doing it in bulk is really sensible at least if your goal is to make money. At least if you want to mine Bitcoin.
[Life Inside a Secret Chinese Bitcoin Mine]( this is the scale at which to do it. On cheap electricity, which I assume they have. 
[Bitcoin Mining in October 2017 - Still Profitable?]( - so maybe if you can get an Antminer S9 (or two)...  [and can stand the noise and power consumption.](
Spend the 3.5 grand on your choice of cryptocoins instead and watch the value climb, would be my advice.

How about we increase the transaction count many times over and then keep working on scaling, in ways that don't violate what Bitcoin is supposed to be?
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:45:56
Yeah, but Bitcoin (segwit 1) is also not working great. At least not for the common man, as it has become unusable as a currency due to high fees and brutal wait times for transfers. The queue as of this writing was over 30000 - after a weekend. This is great for the middlemen, and shit for everyone else.
And the proposed alternative is a blatant corporate takover attempt, as you say, with a mildly larger 2M limit. Neither is all that hot. 
I don't think this fork is quite like the previous fork(s).

The Bitcoin Cash supporters feel that it is more true to the tradition and history of Bitcoin now than the Bitcoin Core. They're therefore apt to describe it as merely Bitcoin. 
And yes, this subreddit is now infamous as being hugely censored and people getting bans - like I'm now likely to get to get now for mentioning that the hugely expanded moderator team is from all accounts working overtime to ban any dissenting viewpoints. So actually tearing down Bitcoin Cash information flyers does indeed exemplify this subreddit to a T.

Well, at the very least use the exchange and the automation there appropriately. I'm a total trading noob and as such am still trading with training-wheel sized amounts, but using a stop limit buy/sell might be an idea. And with cryptocurrency especially, impulse trading sucks. Hell, I made that error the first time I bought something because I was convinced that particular coin was on a sharp upward trajectory and that waiting would just lose me money so I rushed and ordered immediately... of course it wasn't and I lost a few bucks, thankfully only temporarily.

A lot of people will lose their ass. And a lot of people will make fantasy money. The two in fact are connected, gotta be a bunch of idiots involved to lose their money for others to pick it up. 
Of course, scams have been around forever, they've just not been Bitcoin scams. But with the Bitcoin name so hot now, and the rates skyrocketing, I'm not surprised scammers will use it to try to snare idiots.

Except one small problem there is that Bitcoin was never created for "the need to move larger quantities of money around the world to escape from restrictive governments". It was created as a way to move currency, any amount, anywhere, without middlemen. That's now apparently being changed into your version, and people are saying with a straight face that "bitcoin is just a way to store value". 
Plus, if nobody is concerned about high fees and slow transfers, why is there even segwit? If transfers can be slow and super expensive and nobody cares about transactions per second, you may as well remove segwit and go back to the original specification as per the whitepaper, instead of planning to create side chains that are very prone to becoming hubs and middlemen and giving those governments you fear an obvious place to attack the decentralization.
The cryptocurrency revolution has been cancelled. Cryptocurrency is now only for the rich to find a new way to hoard their wealth instead of hoarding it in gold, right?

Why would staying with 1MB be desirable? It's already made Bitcoin useless as a currency. The whole idea was to have a cryptocurrency that people could use without blindingly high fees and long wait times. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:20:59
Yep, without replay protection the only safe path would have been for everyone to move straight to 2X. Which clearly wasn't what was happening. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:58:42
The original chain has other issues to deal with if it wants to remain a useful currency, though. Like blindingly high fees and huge transfer wait times.

@_date: 2017-11-05 07:08:49
Not all forks will even survive, and the other forks that do survive are not the same cryptocurrency. 
Sure, right now there's some legitimate debate on what currency should even be named Bitcoin, but only one of the chains will ever be considered "Bitcoin". The others are then by definition altcoins, with different values. 
There will never be more Bitcoin than the maximum amount possible. There may be some altcoins with the same possible maximum amount, sure.

"Original chain" is such an emotional choice that could have gone no other way. I mean, anyone who has BTC will go "original chain" immediately. Except what does that even mean to people?

Unless you see a powerful exodus of miners who go to mine something else if that something else is even more profitable. Not all cryptocurrencies will survive the long haul. And BTC isn't doing itself any favors with this segwit stuff and the forkapalooza, but of course something has to be done - when transaction fees and wait times are sky high, it drastically reduces the usefulness of BTC as a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:39:04
Yeah that fucking derivatives bubble is an outrage. It's going to fall over and pulverize the world economy. 
Just goes to show how incredibly corrupt Wall Street is - creating money out of thin air based on nothing except the desire to get richer. 
The fact that debt outpaces the actual money available in the world by a factor of three is also some outrageous crap. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:44:33
They're a legitimate "side" in that they're going to fork the coin and they got over 80% of the hashrate at first (which may be less now). If 80% of the hashrate dumps B1X, B1X is going to be hurting. 
And then there's BCH, which is a third "side" that is being made quite a bit of noise over. Not everyone likes segwit. In fact, many people hate segwit, almost as much as they hate a 1M block size. Miners could switch to BCH with a flick of their finger and enjoy great profits straight away, and if they hold BCH they could enjoy that BCH potentially going up 10-fold in the short term. It's not something to be taken lightly. Which is probably why people get banned in here for talking about it.

Yeah, gambling with borrowed money is still insanity. Although, assuming he had the ability to pay down the loan even if things went to shit, it might not have been total insanity. For every person who succeeds with some long shot, you don't see the many who crash and burn in spectacular fashion, I'd say.
Some people may try to replicate that now and buy coins at the current $7k price point - that may or may not turn out to be  a good investment, but if a correction comes along and dumps it to $1k and keeps it there a while, they will not be happy campers.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:11:50
Bitcoin as it stands has lost its ability to be a currency due to the long transfer times and blindingly high fees. This really imperils its core utility in my opinion. Yes, sure, nice to have a store of value and something to invest in but if you can't do diddly with it, then what's the point?

Well, it's interesting to look back and ponder the development. 
The first ever Bitcoin sale of physical goods was famously a pizza, for 10000 Bitcoin. So in today's value, that was a $74 million pizza. But of course you can't really say that because at the time the trade seemed reasonable, or maybe even that the guy who bought the pizza got the better part of the deal.
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:17:27
Yeah, in retrospect I don't even understand the protests. S2X = segwit + 2M block. Current Bitcoin is S1X  - segwit + 1M block. People are, in other words, fine with altering the protocol with segwit which is a huge alteration, but they have a problem with speeding up Bitcoin with 2M blocks? Why would the larger block be an issue, if there is an issue it's surely segwit.

Funny how people in here didn't want to defend Bitcoin when someone was bolting segwit onto it, though. Shadowban or ban, here I come.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:30:08
Bitcoin Cash is literally just the original Bitcoin tech with larger block sizes. So from a technical viewpoint it's fine, and arguably better than B2X. It's also (thanks to the increased block size) actually usable as a currency, unlike Bitcoin. So, I'm not so sure about your opinion. But I guess we'll see what lives and what dies towards the end of the year. Interesting times to be sure.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:48:14
Because they want the more pure Bitcoin implementation we've been using until recently. No segwit, no S2X, and certainly no solutions with middlemen which is what's now trying to get foisted onto Bitcoin in order to control it. And also no 1M maximum, which slows things down immensely and drives fees up to ridiculous levels. 
Bitcoin is supposed to be this disruptive and transformational currency that can be used by all for any purchases, large or small. Good luck doing small quick purchases with Bitcoin as it stands, 1 hour confirmation time and a $5 fee when buying a cup of coffee doesn't really fly. Bitcoin has troubles that need adressing, and S2X isn't it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:01:04
I haven't really been paying attention that long to this space but even to me there are sane and rather troubling reasons to dislike Segwit. Bitcoin as it was created was elegant and damn near bulletproof. Sure, it has scaling issues - what cryptocurrency doesn't at this point? But segwit is not the answer, it's just yet another problem, in addition to the blocksize problem. SegwitCoin is less reliable than Bitcoin. That's troubling to me.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:28:15
That's not a popular discussion in here, apparently it's just fine with blinding high costs to transfer, and transfer times in many hours. Nevermind that it makes Bitcoin unusable as a currency.

The name "Bitcoin" is still what the big dinosaurs are looking for now that they're starting to seriously come in and sink money into cryptocurrencies, but the charm of sinking money into "digital gold" will vane, whereas currencies that actually can be used all the time for purchases should take off hard. Ethereum is much more interesting to me at this point (it actually does something legitimately new and exciting), and even BCH seems like the better Bitcoin. But I guess we'll see how things shake out. I suppose they may all be valid, but used for different things.

High fees that are temporarily low isn't much help. The people who complain about high fees and long transfer times are complaining because of the chilling effect it has on Bitcoin. You can no longer use it as currency all that well due to it just costing too much per transaction.

Taxes are a good thing. 
A nation that taxes and spends the taxes on maintaining the country and its citizens is a peaceful and prosperous nation.

The price of Bitcoin has nothing to do with the discussion, though. Bitcoin was the first, it's the recognized brand name. You could sell dog shit if you could officially get it named Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is, as I've claimed before, unimportant. It's a distraction at best from doing something worthwhile.
Yes, it may be better than fiat money, which is completely illogical and warped, but the whole concept of using money is incredibly bad and does damage. Bitcoin changes nothing in that regard.
If the people squandering their energy on Bitcoin would realize that what's needed isn't a new currency but the abolishment of *all* currencies and help push there instead perhaps we could have a future as a species.
In a world where a grand total of, perhaps, 3% of mankind are needed to do "jobs" and the rest is automated, a social system built on money, trade and profit - with all the vast requirements of that system to have scarcities, enforced servitude, massive resource waste (due to so called "financial efficiency" crushing the quality of any manufactured good) and so forth - simply cannot function. Full stop. 
The next step for humanity is a world of abundance that has no such concept as currency. Not a world that has Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:46:57
Prima facie evidence that Bitcoin is no better than any other coin, be it dollars, euros or pesos. 
It still comes with all the insanely bad drawbacks inherent to a money-based society, and it's just as bad for humankind as any other currency.
