After 4 years, somebody finally [tipped him 0.00162471 BTC]( a couple weeks ago.

What do you mean *again?* That's when you get taxed. You don't get taxed for a bitcoin existing in your wallet.

@_date: 2017-12-23 17:41:02
Well how do you calculate the value before you sell it? It literally trades thousands of dollars apart depending on the exchange. I've never heard anyone say you need to pay taxes on earned bitcoins at a calculated market rate the instant it hits your wallet...That's crazy. If you're a camgirl who gets tipped dogecoins, each tip is a tax event? That doesn't seem right
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:04:12
What? Plenty of people bought $200 bitcoins. How idiotic!

It actually *is* true. The "VHS killed Betamax because of porn" meme became such a circlejerk that the "no, that's wrong" anti-circlejerk is now prevalent and winning. I believe it is true, though. I have not been shown any examples of porn being available on Betamax. In addition to different economies of scale (VHS was practical to make a couple thousand of something, Betamax not so much), Sony wasn't into porn:


Porn *was not available on Betamax.* And the internet didn't exist. It's fair to say VHS killed Betamax because of porn. But I agree it's silly to extrapolate that to "whatever porn supports wins."

Many miners would stop mining and/or fees would increase then. They don't do it to lose money. Transaction fees (which go to the miners)  would be bid up by the market.

I don't know about Litecoin, but if you have a bech-32 enabled address, it will start with bc instead of 1. You can't turn a legacy address into a segwit address, but you can add a new segwit address to your wallet with the addwitnessaddress command I believe.

 The industrial revolution happened just fine without the fed. The crash of 1901 was severe but lasted only 2 years, vs. the decade-long Great Depression in the Fed era. All they can do is sell out the future to *slightly* smooth out the present. Japan is still recovering from central banking decisions 20 years ago

Correct. In electrum, go to import -&gt; sweep private keys

 It wasn't entirely steady and predictable, really. A huge portion of that devaluation happened in the early 1970's when the US suddenly decided they wouldn't exchange gold for dollars anymore, causing the price of gold to go up 5x vs. the dollar in just a few years.

People who didn't vote, didn't vote. I'm tired of this "if you didn't vote, that's a vote for Trump," or "a vote for a third party is a vote for Trump." Bullshit. I didn't vote for Trump.

Just download the BCH and BTG core wallets and wait (painfully) for them to sync. 4 days later, importprivkey with your btc private key and you're good!
I would *never* put my private key into a shitfork client, until *after* I moved my real btc out of that address, just in case the client is malicious (there was in fact a malicious btg client).
Edit: [Here]( is a link to Bitcoin ABC for BCH. And [here]( is a link to the BTG github releases

Ah. You mean it's unsafe because larger blocks discourage people from running full nodes?
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:00:23


Enough investment that banks worldwide will open mining farms, on the house? I...doubt that. One of the most genius things *about* blockchain technology is the compensation of miners.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:33:48
Hm, true, but if you don't have many nodes or much hashpower, you'd still be vulnerable to internal attacks right? I.e. a pissed off IT admin could fuck up a private blockchain easier than a publicly mined one. I'd always kind of equated hashpower with security but you make a good point.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:53:14
Already failed? What time limit ran out? Everyday transactions are just *one* possible use for bitcoin. It's already proven to be a tenable store of value. Why would it need to be supported by anything other than speculation and scarcity? Except a strong consensus that it has value, which already exists. Maybe it will take another 30 years before bitcoin is super mainstream at point-of-sale...who knows. The mining schedule goes for another hundred years...it wasn't "supposed" to replace trillions of dollars of currency by 2017, dude.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:13:03
Interesting. Well, thanks for the perspective

Create a new wallet. It should ask you if you want to do regular or segwit
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:31:57
None, I mean it doesn't matter if it's just sitting there.
I was claiming a shitfork, so I needed to move my coins anyway. I wasn't about to put my private key into the Bitcoin Diamond client when my btc were still at that address!

If you never need a mortgage, sure...but c'mon. Employers look at it sometimes, and if you have a bad score it affects the person you marry. With bad credit you have to buy cars outright or put up with shitty "bad credit no problem" used car dealers. 
I agree that our whole "check your credit score every 4 minutes" society is getting ridiculous. But a bad credit score makes life harder. Let's not delude ourselves into thinking it doesn't matter at all. We should be using bitcoin to make our lives *less* of a struggle.

Isn't it fucked up that we're here sharing tips about savings accounts that *almost* gain value? Pretty sad state. Also, the *majority* of the time the US dollar has been unbacked by gold has been pretty shitty economically (1971-present). The Fed is straight-up useless
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:53:08
To be clear, you think Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin? Lol
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:02:00
Sure. Whatever the blockchain, eliminating miner compensation would be silly.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:20:39


No, new wallet = new seed words and new private keys. Then you just sweep in the coins from your old private key one time.
Edit: It does create a non-segwit transaction with regular high fees, though. Since you're sending from legacy address -&gt; segwit, and fees are only reduced on segwit -&gt; segwit (EDIT:) and on segwit -&gt; legacy
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:48:22
Not infinity, but why not, say, 50 years? Maybe it'll be your kids' inheritance or your retirement fund. It has proven to be an excellent store of value.  People use it more for that than for daily transactions, and that's ok. Bitcoin has only existed 8 years...holding an investment for 8 years isn't that crazy really. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:59:10
Why would people collectively do that? And no. The banks wouldn't go bankrupt. 


They are already loaning a trillion dollars out...a few thousand crypto enthusiasts taking out a few grand each and not paying it back will do aaaaaaaaabsolutely nothing but fuck themselves.

@_date: 2017-10-29 22:22:53
Yeah that's incredibly conservative. Not even 2% of all assets, but just 1-2% of *liquid* assets? That's just unnecessary pandering to the bitcoin-bashing crowd.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:34:09
Dude you're not getting the scope of this.


Correct. They lend out *trillions* and they've already assumed billions and billions of this will be lost to defaults.


How many people would it take? Dude you'd have to get people to take out *billions of dollars* of credit card debt just to make your "wave of defaults" anything more than a rough month for the banks. If you think you can get more money in your let's-be-shitheads-and-not-pay-back-our-credit-card-debt scheme than, like, the *entire market cap of Litecoin* then maybe you'll make enough of an impact to get a mention in the WSJ. If literally every person in this entire sub maxed out their cards and put 10k into crypto and never paid it back, the banks would be...fine.

I get why you *want* it to happen. It's just...so ridiculous. Tens of thousands of people don't just...*do* things that are against their own rational self-interest all at once just because it'd be a neat idea if they all pulled it off. It *does not happen.* Don't waste your brain space on thought exercises like this.


Great, then use 1x of that and pay back your damn loan. I just don't see how you can gripe about these government bailouts (which were caused by people not paying their loans back, largely) and then recommend people not pay their loans back. If I borrow money, I pay it back. That's my style. You do you.

Exchanges use lots of addresses. If you use ShapeShift, it'll give you an address to deposit to. The coins aren't going to stay at that address,  though; then their coins would be scattered across a billion 
addresses. So the exchange automatically moves coins from these user-specific deposit addresses to a larger wallet.
