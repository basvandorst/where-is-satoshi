Appears like it'll take an hour or so.  
A side question.  If I want to send from this wallet elsewhere, is there any way to increase the fee so it goes through quicker?
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:56:08
coinbase has worked well for me
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:16:10
Okay, thanks.  I was just worried because when I search by id it shows the whole thing was confirmed like 20+ times in the last 6 hours....but my piece still unspent.  I guess I will just wait it out with the rescan!
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:30:10
So if I'm understanding you correctly...open up Electrum or GreenAddress, recover my breadwallet wallet using my random word key.  Then I should be able to access the money that appears pending?
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:03:45
Hey, thanks, just did that.  Hopefully this will solve it!
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:35:23
That's what I do now when needed...but figured I'd get some opinions from more avid btc people!

Any advice would be appreciated!

Hey I am talking more so like selling a coin or two, not become a seller per se; if that makes sense.  Do you see a lot of risk in that as well?
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:05:55
Also to add, have been thinking venmo or square cash, but realize chargebacks could happen.  So maybe moneygram or western union.  And then not marking the trade complete until the cash is in hand.

Thanks, appreciate the help

When's the next game? I could really go for $20 in bitcoin! 
(worth a shot ��)
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:40:45
Damn. That's rough.  Probably just stick to localbitcoins as the prices usually aren't too bad depending on method, but cash same day is nice.  Thanks

Hey, what wallet did you use to claim your BCH and then send to HitBTC?
I held bitcoin in my blockchain wallet, which I have the 12 word seed for, during the whole split.  Now I just need to recover that wallet using one that supports BCH and then I can simply send to the exchange to sell, correct?  I just need to know what wallets I can do that from...
Jaxx is working on it,
Freewallet says it supports it but haven't been able to recover my wallet yet on there
Coinomi is only for android

Hey, question.  I currently am holding btc in my blockchain wallet, which I have backed up and have the 12 word seed for. 
So now I need to make a electrum wallet and use the seed to pull my funds to it?  Or can I use like breadwallet on my iphone?  
A small step by step would be a huge lifesaver from someone haha.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:44:17
Bad way to ask my question.  What I mean is this, since I'm using a wallet where I have a 12 word key, after the fork is done I can just recover my wallet with my key using a wallet that was in the list and then it'll show a balance in btc and in bcc, correct?
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:30:52
Hey thanks.  So quick follow up question.  In order to be involved in receiving BCC I need my funds in one of those wallets before the hard fork, right?
So I should send my funds from my blockchain wallet, which is private with keys I hold, to one of the listed wallets?  
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:41:29
Hi, so I understand the very basics of the fork, I think. Just to be sure I'm correct I want to confirm my thinking...
I bought some btc last night and it is sitting in my blockchain wallet, which I have the 12 word seed for.
When the fork happens, I will have btc that I can move to both chains, effectively doubling (not monetarily but quantity) my current position.
To do this, will I just need to send the amount to a wallet for BCC and it will go thru, but it will also remain in my current wallet? If so, any recommendation on mobile wallets that are compatible with BCC, such as breadwallet or something else for iPhone?
Thanks in advance!
Ps, I tried putting this in its own post but it never showed up on the thread.

Is electrum the only wallet with the BCC capability? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:22:50
Hey question about that.  To my understanding selling is instant and then funds go into your USD wallet.  How long does it take to transfer from USD wallet to bank account/back onto debit card?
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:43:10
Depending on method of payment, I always have found localbitcoins.com to be quick.
I always do PayPal payment method and it's relatively low fees.

Wow, that is very unfortunate to hear.  I did some minor snooping on my end and am not happy.  Their address on their site is actually for a completely different company; one that rents out office space for startups, which I thought maybe makes sense.  The company told me they've never had a bitcoin company located at any of their offices nationwide....fuck.
Then the IP for the website is in Los Angeles, the phone number is from Hawaii, and address from Maryland.  Granted this could probably be explained but it's making me fear I just lost out on $800+.  
I plan on going to the gas station and getting a hold of the owner and seeing if he has any way to contact the btm owner other than the number on the machine.  Hoping something will come of it.

In case anyone down the line sees this, eventually the support line called me back. Said I'd have the codes within an hour.
No luck.
Next day called about 15 times and was eventually messaged back on Facebook and after another few hours of a runaround, was able to get the codes and collect my money.
Definitely won't sell to again due to the absolute awful customer service trying to get a hold of them.
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:57:16
So did you literally just lose your bitcoin to them?  It never got resolved?
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:22:19
nice thinking!
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:30:18
u/fuyuasha did you ever get it resolved?
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:43:56
I had this same issue, and then even struggled on my laptop when using a photo I uploaded.  I gave up and have just had a few sellers verify my identity.
