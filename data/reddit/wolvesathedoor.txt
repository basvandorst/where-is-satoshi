Except that I am mining tiny amounts of bitcoin with that old tech as we type. No, I do realize how much more advanced the tech is today. My goal isn't to empty my small savings account to buy some giant blocks that will hit 10TH/s or have a rack of  3 dozen 1080ti's mining altcoins in my basement or some shit. My goal is to put my tiny little usb's (that I already own) to use in their own little useless way. But thanks for bringing me up to speed bruv

With how my laughable fraction of a bitcoin that I had mined (which I think was worth less than $3 at the time) is now somewhere around $92, I think I'll be fine with my $10~ worth of a year's mining. I'm not trying to get rich off crypto. I'm just trying to have fun and put to use what little hardware I already have, reguardless of profit. You seem like you'd be a whole barrel of fun at parties!
