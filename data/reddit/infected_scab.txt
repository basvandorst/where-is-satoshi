I understand, sir. You are as you say a professional writer and speaker and a valuable voice for Bitcoin. However because of the way our organization works it is difficult to raise that number of BTC.
One way I could help convince my boss to get you the 100BTC would be if you would agree to use your influence to help silence some of the other problematic voices in favor of Bitcoin on this subreddit.

Interesting, and I don't doubt it. But it's not that relevant because this is a single event that happened "in 1971 or 1972", decades before the 90s web we're talking about, and was only revealed in 2005. So it has zero bearing on this claim that in the 90s the internet was associated with drugs.

Miners will still invest close to 100% of the value of the mined coins into mining, the biggest expense of which by far is electricity. If the price of BTC increases as predicted, the amount miners will spend on electricity will increase by the same proportion, due to the way the difficulty rate scales.

This is the libertarian fantasy.

You realize a handful of people own most of the bitcoin, right? Far, far worse wealth inequality than with national currency.

Do you really believe this cultish horse shit? Markets can crush people in the blink of an eye.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:54:29
You flatter yourself. Your "ambition" is to take a fat profit doing very little while others create the actual wealth.
@_date: 2015-07-15 07:35:29
It's hard for you to understand because you have not studied economic or political history.

It seems that transaction rate has become so low that individual reports of Bitcoin usage deserve front page posts.

Bitcoin enabled ransomware to be a lot more profitable. That's honest, right?

Nobody in their right would accept a million dollar bitcoin transaction without waiting for several confirmations. The poster I replied to is provably wrong. I am not being pedantic.

That's a grandiose piece of hyperbole. It's nothing more than a private currency that is resistant to manipulation and can be transferred without a third party.
These qualities come at a heavy cost and the true demand for such a thing has never been demonstrated beyond the dark markets, where having no bank in the picture has clear benefits. Elsewhere the only benefits are ideological. It's a truly awful consumer payment vehicle. It has the grace of a steam roller.
