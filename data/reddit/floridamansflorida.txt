OP's setup is double the size of mine. My electric rate is $0.10 kW/h and I'm right around $1300 per month electric bill. Before I setup the ASIC I was averaging $300 per month.
edit: I also had to setup additional AC equipment which by itself adds roughly $50 per month to this $1300 bill.

I'm not the OP....my operation is half the size of OP's here.

Because it's still profitable to do so. The real key to staying profitable at this rate is timing the purchase of new equipment correctly. If you're not first out the gate then it's very difficult to recoup your cost in a timely manner.

$5-$10 per day profit after covering electric for the entire operation.

Now I'm jealous. I get no rate reduction for using more. I've even tried to work out deals with the power company for a better rate if I expanded. The only thing I was able to get out of them was a free transformer upgrade so I could pull more amperage to my home.

Right now, between $5 - $10 per day profit.
IMO, unless you live in a cool dry climate with access to electric rates below $0.06 kW/h, mining just isn't worth all the headache that's involved. I use awesomeminer to automate most of the mining process but being in Florida the additional heat load, costs of running subpanels and other electrical equipment and then additional cooling. I can say after more than 5 years of constantly buying new equipment and running a small operation in a dedicated room it's far more headache than it's worth.
In my 5 year period there's really only been about 9 months worth of mining where I felt like the pros outweighed all the cons and that was when bitcoin was quickly climbing from $900 to nearly $20K. I had many days where my profit was exceeding $150+ per day.

Geographically great location for mining.

In all fairness, everything in Europe can be thought of as a slight loss these days. /s

In 5 years it's ranged between my lowest point of $1,100 (no profit) - $19,000 (peak). My peak was during the 2nd month of running 12 L3+ miners before most people had access to them.
The thing is that if bitcoin were to suddenly rise quickly over it's previous high, I could see monthly profits return from nearly nothing to extremely profitable in just a matter of weeks. On the flip side of this, if bitcoin were to suddenly take a large drop I might not be able to cover my monthly costs if I wasn't fast enough in cashing out.

Somewhat. For me, it started out as a hobby. I'm old and retired and needed something to do. After I was able to get off the boats I was given an old junk PC and got into linux because I couldn't afford anything that cost money. A few decades later my hobby eventually evolved into crypto.
You really don't need to do most of that stuff to maximize your earning potential especially if you're looking to stay a single person operation. For tax purposes I personally would recommend setting up an LLC S corp. This way you can claim all your equipment and electric bills without making the process overly complicated. S corps are also receiving some nice benefits under Trumps tax plan.
I would also tell you that for 95% of people considering mining that it's going to be far more profitable to simply buy bitcoin now and wait for the price to rise. I would never recommend that someone get into mining as a full time business unless you can secure cheap electricity.

Bold strategy there Cotton. Will it pay off?
I have some trading bots setup that have saved me from this in the past. Still risky no matter what way you look at it.

If you're European, just be careful that you don't make a meme about any of this.

Already setup that way. All heat is exhausted to the outside, none is recirculated.
