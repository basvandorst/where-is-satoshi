I still don't understand what you're asking for. What I posted was the detailed confirmation directly from the Coinbase transaction, INCLUDING the fee. Here's screenshots showing the LESS detailed transaction pulled up from my Coinbase account:

I still don't get it, but what I CAN say as someone that uses BC sparingly, is that this will turn a LOT of people off. Coinbase/Bitcoin/whoever, needs to fix this shit. 
Six months ago I thought BC was great, and was kicking myself for not investing, but I won't be using it in the future. Transaction/Network/Mining fees should be negotiated and absorbed by the vendor like credit card transactions, and never charged to the payer/consumer.

Listen, I've already spent way too much time on this, and given you more detailed info than should be warranted (at this point I feel like you're phishing), but here are the two that were sent via Coinbase:
I don't have the actual purchase transaction because it's my Bitpay wallet on my mobile, but it was a similar amount. 
All I wanted to know is what was going on with the fees? Why they're so high? Why was it such a PITA? Was it something I was doing wrong? Was it just an anomaly? Etc., etc.

I think this is what you're asking for?

That was a screenshot of the detailed transaction directly from my Coinbase account. I can't even pull-up my Bitpay account on my PC. It's just on my mobile.

You've lost me. Not sure why you're being argumentative? I was charged around $15 (or more) per transaction, including the 2 transaction where I just transferred my balance. Coinbase certainly didn't "take care of it". I thought the fee was ridiculous, which is why I asked the initial question, and if this was the "new normal"? 
As an example, I transferred around $25, but only $9 dollars were actually sent because of the bullshit fee. 
EDIT: I even got a message saying, ***"spending my remaining balance will need significant Bitcoin network fees"!*** WTF?

That's the problem. In the past, I've used Coinbase, and other wallets to make transactions with no problem (simply using a QR Code with almost no fee), but for whatever reason I couldn't pay a Bitpay invoice through Coinbase, so I transferred my balance, then got hit with a crazy fee. Then the price kept dropping, so I didn't have enough to cover the charge, plus fee, so I had to buy more (3 more buys to be exact), &amp; then transfer more. Then finally making the purchase with yet another fee. 
It was a PITA compared to the past, and the fees were ridiculous. I even had to reduce the fee type to super economy or some crap just to get the last transaction to go through.

Is that not a novice/beginner/newb?

So, the fees are dependent on the amount of transactions on any given day? What I was paying isn't the new normal?
