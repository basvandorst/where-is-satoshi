There will be movement, but saying that it will hit 0 is not realistic at all

BTC has seen some impressive development for these 10 years. Huge ups and downs. Let\`s see how it is getting used and adopted in the next 10

The Frog will love Mt Gox real story...

good one

I don\`t think this will speed up BTC adoption. The fact that some provocative group is shouting "NO" to EUR does not mean that people will blindly accept cryptos just like that

Yeah, and absolute scam that is going to crumble in some time and become an all time fad!

Yep, it is property at the moment, but might be a scam tomorrow and no property the day after.

But it will go up as soon as the price goes up right? As far as I know the higher the price the more miners are attracted, the more the miners the higher the hashrate, the higher the hashrate the lower the returns of mining in terms of blocks. Or is my logic incorrect?

Misleading title really. No cryptocurrency is there yet when it comes to using it in daily life and I\`m not expecting that to happen anytime soon

This will kill off the mining profits, although there are no profits at the moment too haha

First I thought that is one of the standard scams, but in the end I loved it!   
Really funny interpretation of the BTC investing reality :D

I don\`t get it why such people are allowed to tweet. They should be banned!
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:55:04
let\`s see how far this goes. I\`m not a big optimist to be honest

How did you exactly pay? Which wallet, payment service, etc did both of you use?
