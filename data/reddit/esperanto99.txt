Peter Schiff looks and sounds like a hostage.

One key item that everyone seems to agree on: the Feds don't need new laws to deal with crime involving cryptos. I loved when there was laughter when it was suggested that cash was a great tool for money laundering.

Thank you for posting this article from June.

It has to be crack if you are coinbasing

Peter Schiff seemed to speak under duress. I feel sorry for Peter Schiff.

So in a deflationary currency, might we see negative-interest loans?

Hi, I'm Peter Schiff, an unapologetic shill for a precious metals company. I'm a little dubious on this digital currency thing, so better buy gold.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:31:20
That's I.

You were probably better off continuing to pay the minimum on the loan and hanging on to the coin.

Cool. In terms of micros, I'm a millionaire.

These altcoins all have names the seem to portray an inferiority complex. Litecoin, Feathercoin, Zerocoin. Not cool for a currency, which should project strength and stability. Think maybe HammerCoin or SolidCoin.

The Senate is going to be completely bewildered. They will not understand Bitcoin. Except Rand Paul.

Well, look at it this way, Max Keiser is all set to pump the crap out of Ł.

Don't panic if it goes back to 200. That's when you average down rather than exit. If the bet is that bitcoin will become a major player in the currency game, then getting in now gives you a lot of purchasing power when bitcoin is mainstream. If the bet is that you can cash out for more US currency down the road then you are making a mistake.

So should one be "a Satoshus"? ;)

Fastcoin comes in at 12.

Cryptocurrency is valuable because it is a medium of exchange. Bitcoin has no more "intrinsic" value than pick-an-altcoin, but because it is more well-known, it is more valuable... In both dollar terms and intrinsically.

Make a creative looking paper wallet... Make it for .01 BTC... With the phrase "One Million Satoshis" conspicuously displayed. Then walk them through what it takes to get it online and spend it.

When we get to the moon, we'll be dealing with microbits and satoshis.

Mill is also used for a permillage point, i.e. a tenth of a percentage point. In some localities, they will talk about "raising the millage" which would mean a tax increase amounting to some fraction of a percent. 
The proposal certainly makes sense although to me I'd expect such a linguistic development to happen organically anyway rather than by fiat. Oops did I say that?
