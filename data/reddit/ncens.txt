Who should be running a full node: I think everyone should be able to run full node if they want. They may not make much money mining by running it on a commonplace desktop but at least they can run it if they want to. If they want to make money mining stuff, they can go get better hardware.

Genuine question. Which particular services are you referring to?
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:58:37
I’m no expert but I feel that one should ALWAYS have the option of running a full node on whatever machine they want (within reasonable limits). Any machine that perhaps fits the minimum system requirements that a Linux distro such as Ubuntu or CentOS lists on its website and hard drives with sizes that are commonly found on most user desktops. 
If the block size causes the chain to grow so big that I can’t run it on a new $1500 laptop I bought a week ago,  that’s taking decentralization away, IMO.

Everytime I see someone on CNBC talk about crypto, I think back to this: [

Yeah. No need to mention the time. Just display the last block number ;\)

Coming up next: a bitcoin fork that invalidates all gox coins after the trustees have gotten paid their equivalent in fiat.^:D

Well probably not yet, but lots of money to be made for the people who do it first. Big spreads. 
So if you have to buy and/or sell, it’s a good choice alongside localbitcoin.

I mean, the guy was living in another era.. we barely had PCs let alone the internet. Banks were the only alternative at the time, expecting people to keep all their money as cash at home was/is not feasible. That's the problem bitcoin solves.

I get that, a good number of people don't really want to make the effort or are too inept to handle money themselves and would want to leave it to banks/custodians.
Crypto gives you the *option* though. You can be your own bank if that is important to you.

Yea the move was predominantly in Asian exchanges, some of which are notorious for faking vols. 
CBP average volume was about 735 million as opposed to an 90-day average of 125 million. 
There was certainly high volume but not groundbreaking/historic when adjusting for sanity.
