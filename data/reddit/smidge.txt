This. The mainstream will continue to be satisfied with traditional payment methods until they have an additional benefit for using Bitcoin. This might be the merchants giving out price discounts for Bitcoin payments from the fees they save. Mainstream consumers will do anything for even a small discount, even use a Bitcoin Wallet on their phone.

Bitcoin will not be able to scale enough to handle world wide usage, ever. Bitcoin is the cash register at a bar. All layers on top are the tab, which are going to scale and do the heavy lifting. Once in a while, you use the register to verify all past transactions (= beers that you had in the meantime). This is what costs transaction fees for each user.

This is what I literally ask myself every day.
There is so much good news out there, and it is all over the place. BTC are so easy to acquire, so where are all the new buyers? I understand that at current market price, you would need $800k a day to compensate the 3,600 new coins coming into existance. But that is **nothing** compared to the worldwide potential that is enabled every day based on the hype that is being generated.
There must be thousands of people getting to know Bitcoin each day, reading the Whitepaper and start accumulating Bitcoin right away or after a few days, like many people on this subreddit.
Also, $3B Mkt Cap is still a joke, as described. At least if you compare it to the world wide remittances market, Mkt Cap of Gold, or other practical use cases.

@_date: 2014-03-24 11:13:26
Gold is considered as insurance against crises of all kinds, but the precious metal now has some competition from the Internet. Bitcoin seems to be the better gold. We have two experts against each other.
Gold is considered as the crisis currency number one. It has been used for thousands of years. Those who fear the end of the world invest their money in gold bars or coins. But the precious metal has recently got competition: Bitcoin, the cyber currency from the Internet. It's followers say that Bitcoin is the better gold.
We have two experts against each other, which may explain why they bet on either gold or Bitcoin. One of them, Martin Siegel, is the CEO of gold trading company Westgold located in Bad Salzuflen. He also manages several funds with gold stocks. The other, Oliver Flaskämper, is Managing Director of Bitcoin.de, Germany's largest online marketplace for Bitcoin based in Herford.
But before the discussion of the two professionals, who both coincidentally come from East Westphalia, let us first have an overview: First, Gold and Bitcoin seem to have very little in common. Gold is mined from deep within the earth, painfully separated from the rock and melted, cast into ingots, shaped in the form of coins or made ​​into jewelry. Most importantly, Gold is physically present, you can touch it.
Bitcoins exist in the virtual world. They are calculated through complex algorithmic procedures. It consists of encrypted data packets identified by numbers and letters. There are Bitcoin only since 2009, invented by a programmer whose identity is still not fully understood today. On the Internet, the virtual currency is steadily growing in popularity. The share price rose so rapidly that a Bitcoin was worth more than an ounce of gold for a short time at the end of last year. No wonder then that Bitcoins have also been referred to as gold for computer nerds. Some use Bitcoin as a payment method already - a few online shops already accept it. Others see in it a promise for a better future.
**Mr. Siegel, Mr. Flaskämper, where is a safe place for money in times of crisis?**
Martin Siegel : "Gold is the best "crisis metal" since 5000 years. Paper currencies come and go. Bonds become worthless and expire. Real estate loses value or go under. It is true that the exchange value of Gold fluctuates. But people around the world have never lost faith in gold and have always assigned a certain purchasing power to it."
Oliver Flaskämper : "Bitcoins are especially, like gold, rare. There will not be more than 21 million Bitcoins. This was defined in the mathematical algorithm of the software in the beginning. Therefore, Bitcoin is basically like gold in times of crisis, a store of value. Gold certainly has the advantage that the trust in it has grown over centuries, and the Bitcoin economy with five years in existance has yet to earn this trust. Because Bitcoin is also still in an experimental stage, there are still residual risks that may negatively affect the price."
**What is better protected against access from the state?**
Siegel: "When gold is kept fragmented and physically, it is relatively well protected against access. Here, Gold has great advantages over savings accounts, insurance or real estate. The past has shown that totalitarian regimes tend to access the property of the population. The more undemocratic and repressive the governments develop, the more you have to count on them taxing or prohibiting the ownership of gold. But even with such measures, in the past there were usually options to switch to other metals or properties."
Flaskämper: "If you keep your about 50 characters long private key secure, which is so to say the password to access a Bitcoin account, no one can steal or seize the Bitcoin - not even the state. Physical movement of Bitcoins, i.e. when traveling, is not necessary, since you can access them from anywhere in the world where there is Internet access."
**What about anonymity?**
Siegel: "The anonymous purchase of gold is possible, under the Money Laundering Act, up to a certain volume. The question remains whether the state could remove the anonymity if it detects a criminalization of the gold ownership. With today's possibilities of surveillance of the population, it is likely going to be difficult to be able to own anything anonymously."
Flaskämper: "All Bitcoin transactions are stored in a public database on the Internet, the Blockchain. Everyone, even the state, can see here how many Bitcoin were transferred between the various addresses. However, no one can see which people are behind the Bitcoin addresses. Only at the connection points to the traditional money system, such as businesses or trading systems that accept Bitcoin as payment, you can assign persons to transactions directly. Therefore, a high degree of anonymity is given."
**Where is the ability to be traded better?**
Siegel: "Gold is being traded at thousands of banks and gold dealers in virtually any fragmentation." 
Flaskämper: "Because Bitcoins are digital, they can easily be bought and sold on the Internet or from person to person. Basically, this is also possible with gold, but the gold purchased on the internet usually takes several days to find its way to the buyer. In addition, the transport is usually costly and dangerous. Gold currently still has the advantage that the number of acceptance points is huge. Here, Bitcoin still has a lot of catching up to do. This behaves approximately like the number of charging stations for electric cars compared to the number of classical gas stations."
**What about the cost?**
Siegel: "The cost of storage and transport for physical gold are marginal in proportion to the value and lie well below the management fees of stocks, investment funds or the acquisition fees of insurance or investment contracts. The cost of transactions, however, are relatively high and lie, depending on the denomination, between three and ten percent. The transaction costs are significantly lower for non-physical gold, but include the counterparty risk, bearing the risk of a total loss in the current systemic crisis of the international monetary system. "
Flaskämper: "Like gold, you can store Bitcoins basically yourself. This will not cost anything, but also you don't have to take care of security. The transportation of Bitcoin is practically free of charge. This is basically the highlight of the Bitcoin system. Bitcoins are transferred almost as easy and as fast as an e-mail worldwide without any fees."
**What will prevail as a currency, and why?**
Siegel: "Gold-backed currencies are inflation free and debt free over centuries. After the failure of the current pyramidic credit system, the desire for a solid currency will be great. Even if a gold-backed currency has minor disadvantages, it will prevail, when in the future the terms 'Saving', 'equity' and 'responsibility' will be valued higher again by the society than the terms 'consuming', 'debt' and 'reallocation of wealth'."
Flaskämper : "From my point of view, Bitcoins are 'digital gold with a payment option'. I would say it is the advancement of physical gold as we know it, to digital gold of the internet age. Even if virtual currencies such as Bitcoin still have a long way to go, I am very convinced that in our globalized and increasingly interconnected world, free digital currencies will find their place. The Bitcoin therefore has the potential to establish itself as a worldwide accepted, free parallel currency."
**Conclusion: Alternative to paper currencies**
The followers of gold can look back on a long history, in which the noble metal was recognized as a means of payment. However, the times of the gold standard, where currencies were officially backed by gold, are over since decades. 
Bitcoin exists only for a few years. They are currently not more than a niche phenomenon. The price varies extremely: In early 2011, the cost of a Bitcoin according to data provider Coindesk was less than a dollar, a year later, five dollars. Another year later, $13. Last year, the price soared to a $1,200 high. This year, the price had fallen to $550, after one of the largest exchanges slid into bankruptcy from one day to the other. Confidence in the young currency is damaged by this. Many experts consider Bitcoin as a big ponzi scheme. The German Bundesbank is not getting tired to warn the population from Bitcoin.
(12 month BTC chart)
Another risk in the virtual currency is that an error has been found in the open souce code, which can be seen by anyone. The risk that more such errors are still found, however, decreases with each day passing. Therefore, the virtual currency has other advantages. It is extremely quick and mostly anonymously tradeable at almost no cost. The transaction fees on the purchase and sale of Bitcoin, depending on the exchange, lie between 0.2 and 0.5 percent of the trading volume.
A crucial point in both "currencies" is that the total supply can not be increased willingly. With gold, this lies in the natural occurrence and Bitcoins are mathematically limited. In this, both gold and Bitcoin differ from the conventional paper currencies. Since the financial crisis, we know that the money is in our pockets is not as safe as we assumed for a long time. Basically, each currency is based only on trust - the trust that someone else wants to have the currency, whether it is dollars, gold, glass beads or even Bitcoin.

Since no one will ever read down into the depths of this forsaken area, I am hiding my secret Lemon Cupcake Recipe in here:
3 cups self-rising flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons lemon zest
1 cup whole milk, divided
2 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided
 
Lemon Cream Icing
2 cups chilled heavy cream
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 30 cupcake pan cups with paper liners.
Sift the self-rising flour and salt together in a bowl. In another bowl, beat the unsalted butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating each egg until incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract and lemon zest.
Gently beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture, one third at a time, alternating with half the milk and half the lemon juice after each of the first 2 additions of flour. Beat until just combined; do not over mix.
Fill the prepared cupcake liners with batter 3/4 full, and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before removing them to finish cooling on a rack.
To make the icing, beat the cream in a chilled bowl with an electric mixer set on Low until the cream begins to thicken. Add the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice, a little at a time, beating after each addition, until fully incorporated. Increase the mixer speed to High, and beat until the icing forms soft peaks, about 5 minutes. Spread on the cooled cupcakes. Refrigerate leftovers.

IoT devices (Smart Home Appliances, like Thermostats etc.) could do the job of maintaining the ~~public~~ private ledger of which device is registered in which building or group. I don't think that this has anything to do with Smartphones in the short term, it might be extended to TVs as they are seen as part of the Smart Home Ecosystem.
Devices require very low performance for this, as updates are not needed frequently.

Google is usually a very early mover when it comes to new technologies. Up to the point where they create them themselves (Google X Projects). In the case of Bitcoin, something is clearly holding them back. No one knows for sure what that is, but it is clear that not a single Google product/service is using Bitcoin.

Bitcoin rose to prominence as a virtual currency, but its underlying technology will quietly alter industries from finance to advertising and ultimately win over consumers, the CEO of bitcoin startup 21 Inc. said Wednesday.
In an interview at the WSJDLive global technology conference, Balaji Srinivasan said bitcoin’s path could mirror that of the open-source software Linux, which isn't well-known by consumers but underpins the Android mobile-operating system and other key pieces of technology.
“What happened is Linux won but by stealth,” Mr. Srinivasan, whose startup is backed by venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a board partner. “In the same way, I think that a lot of people are going to be using bitcoin without realizing they’re using bitcoin.”
Recently, the technology at bitcoin’s core has gained attention for its potential to change the way companies do business. Bitcoin is widely seen as a form of money today, but over time bitcoin will come to be seen as “a protocol,” Mr. Srinivasan said.
For example, blockchain technology—which allows the bitcoin network to track the currency’s movement from one online wallet to another—can be used to improve transparency and accountability in financial transactions, allowing a deeper level of financial auditing, Mr. Srinivasan said. “You can track every cent.”
Blockchain technology could provide a new way to pay for content that is currently supported by advertising, he added.
But the technology’s rise hinges on when it is incorporated into devices, just as the growth of the Internet was spurred in part by Microsoft Corp.’s decision to build Internet protocols into Windows, he said.
“We think something similar is going to happen with bitcoin where once bitcoin is built into devices, and devices natively have the capacity to turn power into digital currency, then a whole new class of applications will be built on the Internet,” Mr. Srinivasan said.

Agreed. talked about this model many times. Its about solutions where end users not notice anymore that Bitcoin is being used.

In the last x years, the whole backend infrastructure has been changed without impacting the end user experience, but making it cheaper/free, more accessible, etc.

Is this where you could use another sidechain implementation? For example the recently announced Liquid by Blockstream, but between participating banks instead of exchanges. Every trade would at the same time be the settlement and you would have confirmations (= validations of who owns what) regularly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Like the famous sidechain example of having a tab at a bar and the bartender sometimes using the cash register for settlement.

So if you are mentioning the "philisophical version", I would go as far as saying that every human being and even every living thing is a blockchain on its own. Things that have been seen, felt, experienced etc. cannot be undone. They will be recorded and can be emphasized or recalled, but not entirely deleted.
Does this mean that the Bitcoin blockchain is not only the most abstract form of money, but also the closest that a computer network has become to a human being?
The blockchain can record events, though it is missing sensors. It has an immune system and can react to threats through it's open source code.
Just my 2 Satoshis on this "philosophical version". Thoughts?

For me it's ETFs aswell, but in the form that everyone (globally) with a brokerage account can easily trade shares and set up their own savings plans, 401k, retirement savings plans, etc.
It must be easy, and it must feel like all other investments.
Edit: Also, Bitcoin hitting 10k-15k USD per coin. That would be half of Google's market cap, a third of Apple's and 3% of the money invested in Gold.

- Make a plan to sell 40 BTC (and stick to it) every time the price hits 1k, 2k, 3k... up to 10k

I am not talking about getting the maximum out of the market (hitting the lowest lows when buying etc., as stated above), because it is impossible. Of course it is better to invest ASAP when you know the market is going to go up... but you don't know it. And the market can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent. That is where it gets dangerous, that is why you should average out your buying prices.
I was talking about playing it safe and low risk. Speaking of low risk, investing with borrowed money is the worst thing you can do when you're investing low risk. And also, please note that I am talking about investing, not speculation. It is a big difference.

If I understand correctly, this is a 1:1 investment in BTC/USD.

You can get better at it by applying simple strategies, like splitting the $500 into 5x $100 that you invest every 2 weeks, or every month. That way, you don't always hit the lowest lows (not the highest highs either), but instead get a nice cost average effect over time. If you manage to pull this off over the 2.5/5 months, you have proven more patience than 85% of the participants in the market. Do the math, it works for every liquid market.
