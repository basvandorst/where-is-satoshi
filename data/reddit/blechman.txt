There's more to bitcoin than just the price. The last three months it has been unusable and only very recently started to drop below the ridiculous, but that is only because newcomers that came in and tried it probably thought WTF? and left.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:52:19
Except that they are not artificially limited like bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:00:14
People seem to forget that this system is intended to replace cash. If I have to pay a hefty fee to use it, I'll just use something else. If I have to pay a hefty fee and wonder if my transaction will be confirmed in 10 minutes, 3 hours, or 3 days then the system has failed in it's very purpose of existing. I'm not talking about block variance, but confirmation times due to congestion.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:33:37
You are not contributing, only set up a full node for your own benefit. You are not helping the network, it is not a mesh. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:37:55
That's not how bitcoin works. It's a graph not a mesh. Full nodes have no impact in what gets included in a block. You have been misinformed or have the wrong end of the stick. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:06:10
I think it is you that needs to do the research. The only nodes required to validate transactions are full nodes (i.e. miners), not raspberry pis LMAO. As I said the only reason you would need to run a "full node" (which isn't really a full node because they are miners), is if you're a large merchant or must validate the chain yourself. 99.9% of users are just fine with an SPV wallet.
Go and do your research.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:11:40
The blockchain can grow to TBs in size, who cares? I don't need to download the blockchain on my raspberry pi to use bitcoin. Only the miners do, and people like bitpay and coinbase, but they're running data centers anyway.
But hey, lets push away all the people that could use bitcoin. As I said, it's a totally sad situation and a shitshow.
Luckily we have alternatives like Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:01:17
There should never have been a backlog in the first place. Bitcoin has either been grossly mismanaged or intentionally sabotaged, and I'm not sure which.
It's only a matter of time before it gets bad again or maybe people will just move to other coins and 1mb forever and LN will be just fine for the remaining users as market share slumps further and further. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:44:13
Don't talk about bitcoin at parties.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:55:54
You don't understand how it works. The miners decide what fees to accept. They can state &gt; 0 sat. fee if they want, and with hundreds of thousands of transactions in a block there is enough incentive there for them to mine when the block reward declines over time.
You must be new, the blocks have only been full in the last year or so and it was never a problem before.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:26:26
I fully understand the incentives, that (aggregate fees + block reward) should be greater than mining cost and as block reward decreases over time, the aggregate fees must be higher to compensate assuming difficulty does not decrease over this period.
The thing I don't get is why aggregate fees need to be forced up NOW when the block reward is sufficient. The user experience over the last few months has absolutely sucked with merchants leaving in droves. This is not good and the damage may be permanent as merchants seek alternatives like BCH, LTC, whatever. The situation is a shitshow.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:54:51
Thanks for the reply, but you didn't explain why it is necessary. Just that someone researched it. I'm looking for solid reasons backed by research and have found literally nothing.
I will postulate that a backlog creates high fees and unpredicatable confirmation times, both of which give a bad user experience. I fail to see how it can be good with even my most rose tinted spectacles on.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:16:40
Wtf are you talking about? Bitcoin is not a party and it saddens me immensely to see what has happened to it over the last few years. So much potential squandered. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:43:01
Well I don't believe that to be true. Cash is fast and free, bitcoin isn't anymore. There's no reason why we have to suffer high fees and long transaction times, it has been artificially thrust upon us by incompetence or maliciousness.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:05:56
Omg I've never read so much horseshit. If bitcoin doesn't have the capacity to support one exchange then it's not fit for purpose.
You are fucking delusional to think that the failings of bitcoin are perceived as attacks. Are you drunk or something? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:58:05
I would rather have a function piece of software where I can send money reliably without being ripped off with high fees than overly worry about a non-issue. Priorities are back to front.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:06:14
You really should look at the facts and remove your confirmation bias. Look at the chart and what bitcoin market share was just one year ago, it's sad. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:56:50
Right but it will be too late. Major adoption will have happened elsewhere. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:45:07
No. Their users will be seeking utility and bitcoin doesn't deliver it. By the time LN comes around at scale, if it ever works, bitcoin market share will be below 20% if not lower and bitcoin will be the myspace of crypto. It's already happening but it seems you're blind to it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:34:57
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:48:38
LOL, so you really think coinbase are attacking bitcoin? You seriously think that?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:59:01
Markets can be irrational. If you look carefully the altcoins went up exactly when bitcoin's blocks became full, but I guess you're too blind to see it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:45:56
What do you mean there is no rush? Blocks are full! Have you not noticed?! Merchants are turning away, users are turning away, the altcoin market boomed in 2017 because bitcoin cannot service its users. No rush, let's just plod along until we are totally irrelevant...
This attitude is destroying bitcoin in front of your very eyes.
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:45:02
Same for bitcoin cash 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:49:26
If there's extra space in blocks then more transactions will go into those blocks and the aggregate fee will be higher. It's simple mathematics. Why the blocksize has been artificially limited to the point that merchants are leaving and users are leaving is reckless.
If there was a substitute technology to take the load caused by huge demand for bitcoin transactions aside from increasing the block size, then great let's go with that, but there just isn't anything ready. It's really, really sad for me as an early adopter to see this great opportunity get usurped by competitors.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:51:10
I'm not sure if you're trolling or just stupid. Can you explain why a backlog is needed in a peer to peer electronic cash system?

We need bitcoin in the "West" too to escape the clutches of the Fed, BoE, BoJ and ECB. We don't need it as urgently as developing nations, but we still need it. The masses don't understand that though. 
All it requires in the "West" is an incentive from merchants. 
For example I am in UK and buy a lot of equipment from scan.co.uk. They now accept bitcoin but they are not incentivizing me to use it, and to be honest as passionate as I am about bitcoin, why should I go to the trouble of going on localbitcoins, buying my bitcoin and then shopping with it on scan.co.uk? It's cheaper and easier to use my credit card, sadly. Merchants need to incentivize people because they stand to gain a lot from bitcoin with reduced fees, no chargebacks, etc. If there are no incentives, most people won't bother.

UK system is better. I can make electronic payments to other people in different banks and the payment is usually cleared in under 5 minutes. I can go to a shop and pay with my debit card in seconds without having to swipe it or type in my PIN if the value is less than 20 GBP using Contactless payment. 
However, if the government decides to implement captial controls, or I want to move large amounts of money, or my account activity "looks suspicious" the bank/government can deny me access to my funds.
I have also been defrauded in the UK in the last three months - but got a refund from Visa. Bitcoin solves the last two problems nicely.

Paul Craig Roberts recently said in an interview that if a large enough government perceives bitcoin to be a threat, then they could intervene in a drastic way. Like they have manipulated treasuries and gold prices, they could accumulate a lot of bitcoin, either on the market, or more commonly through seizures, and then dump a load all at once to send the price to the floor.
I remain unconvinced of this strategy though because you cannot naked short bitcoin, like you can with Gold Futures on Comex, neither can you depress the "spot price" of bitcoin for long as eager buyers step in and take bitcoin from the government at cheap prices.

Is this flamebait?
VISA/Mastercard can yank payments from the merchant DAYS after a transactions has completed ("confirmed").
Bitcoin is seen by the network within seconds. The merchant can decide what level of confirmation is required. Buying a car? Maybe wait for 2 or 3. Buying a house? Maybe 4-6. Buying a coffee? Don't wait for a confirmation.
BTC cannot be inflated for political gain.
BTC is a distributed ledger, not just a currency.
It is volatile because it is young and thin. When it gets fat and old it will be less volatile (basically the inverse of me). :D
