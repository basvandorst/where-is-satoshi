What was the suggestion?

What was this, if you don't mind?

~~&gt;People are simply not trustworthy.~~
~~Have you heard of ClearCoin?~~
Never mind, I saw that it's out of service.

There is no link in this post. What could a site called "kink.com" offer as a paid service, other than porn?
This is too obvious for a NSFW tag.

Those stairs are an approximation of the real supply/demand. The fact that they are not infinitesimally small means the market is not perfect. Please make use of them while you can. Do just like that bot does, only finer.

I don't mean an ewallet offered by the site, but your own personal, encrypted one, stored locally (like powercow said).
2: If he hasn't made the transactions yet, and you have a COPY of your wallet, then you can transfer them to another one, and his won't get accepted by the network. IIRC, there is a daily limit on withdrawal on MtGox, so you might have a chance of getting the bitcoins first.

The bots make use of human mistakes instead of other humans. But the bots can react much quicker, so the market becomes more close to ideal, where the market is unaffected by impulses, and thus unpredictable, except if you use techniques bots can't.

*Blocks* of the stuff. All nice and freshly made. This will certainly make me go wild.

In that case, I stand corrected.

So that's why the market crashed!
Be sure to transfer your money to another ewallet before they get spent by the thief.

Buy high, sell low. That's how you feed our automated friends.

Perhaps some people base their investment decisions on what Silk Road does.
