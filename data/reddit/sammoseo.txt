I agree 100%. But let me just add to your statement:
"market cap is a joke of a metric"... for very small-cap coins. (EDIT: small/new coins, not small-cap coins).
It becomes a more useful metric, the bigger the coin is. Right? Therefore, the above chart is actually pretty cool beans.

Let me clarify what the chart is - historical market cap of 'top 5' relative to each other (100% = top 5 market cap). It ignores the other 1000+ altcoins.
What can this show us?
An upward trend can indicate the coin is growing at a faster rate than the other 4.
A downward trend suggests the coin is growing at a slower rate than the other 4.
If all 5 coins were just horizontal lines for example, they would all be growing/shrinking at the same rate (vs 1000+ altcoins).
I think that's it?

"It doesn't magically become meaningful once it gets big enough"
Er... yeh it does. Bitcoin's market cap &gt; Litecoin's market cap... maybe that tells us something? Or Bitcoin has just been 'gamed' more?

When looking at top 5... (ignoring all altcoins), BTC's dominance has been increasing all year.

Sorry I should change this to:
"market cap is a joke of a metric"... for very new/hyped/theoretical coins.
I agree with you that it's not actually the market cap size that makes it a more useful metric. This can be gamed, as you say.
Generally - we're talking about the TOP 5 here, so market cap means something.

Yeh, see my corrected statement. I see what you are saying and agree. But listen to this...
Forget about small altcoins for a moment (as these can be just gamed as you say).
Lets talk about Bitcoin vs Litecoin.
You are saying *Market Cap means nothing* when comparing these?

Jolly good. I agree.
So can this chart tell us anything? If only to compare BTC and LTC.
The fact that BTC is gaining relative to LTC must indicate something.
The fact BTH is actually in a downtrend relative to BTC and LTC...
