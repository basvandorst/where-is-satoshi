I am not even sure how this ban would be implemented. Its not as simple as a porn ban where they asked ISP's to block certain URL's. I understand that you wouldn't be able to convert your BTC to fiat INR, and it will kill any exchanges that are running out of india. You can trade on exchanges like binance and other.
