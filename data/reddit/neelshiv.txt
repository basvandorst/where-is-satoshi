This seems like a great idea. I wonder why people don't do this with the stock market.

Because bitcoins themselves do not have intrinsic value, they are a fiat currency. Furthermore, the fact that businesses feel the need to exchange them for other fiat currencies the minute that they receive them is a sign that bitcoin has a long way to go before it can widely be accepted.

You can invest in nearly anything on the stock market with $1100.

If they accept yen and euros (I have no idea if they do), they are probably doing it because luxury retailers are known for accommodating their customers. If one of the smaller retailers here, such as a person who sells wax cases or cat beds, accepted bitcoins last friday and did not convert them to another currency immediately, they would have been burned immensely as the purchasing power of their recent income was cut in half. This sort of instability is the reason why retailers will be slow to adopt bitcoin. It is also the reason why economies in parts of Africa that are hit with significant and volatile inflation naturally start using currencies other than their own (such as the more stable USD).

If you are a business that operates in a region where euros or yen are accepted, you probably don't have a problem holding on to them for future transactions.
If you are a business that operates entirely within the united states and you accept euros or yen that you have no use for, I have no idea what your plan is.

Please read my other comments on the word fiat. Thanks.

I understand what the word "fiat" means, and I understand how that led to the name "fiat money" for this sort of item, but that does not change what the many definitions or characteristics of fiat money are. The only use for bitcoins is financial transactions, and as a result, they fit the definition of fiat money.

This is a problem that I did not realize I had.

I definitely agree with you there. All I am suggesting is that the current need to immediately get rid of bitcoins to alleviate yourself of risk is not a good thing. Bitcoins are surviving despite this problem, but currencies generally die because of this problem. I think one of the key distinctions here is that bitcoin, overall, is seeing deflation. Most currencies that die because of this see inflation. Regardless of what direction they are moving, extreme movements or volatility in value hinders business activity because people do not know the future value of what they are giving away or accepting. For that reason, I maintain that stability will be required for bitcoin to become widely accepted by businesses. Around the world, this stability typically takes place in the form of slight but controlled inflation, as this activity promotes economic activity rather than saving/hoarding. Stability will also pull in people who actually want to use bitcoin as a currency and drive away people who are using bitcoins only to try to increase the value of their money without contributing to the use of bitcoin as a unit for transactions.

Like I said, I'm glad it worked out for you, but your story makes absolutely no sense. One of your initial comments said that you were too poor to invest in anything else. Then you said that you had a decent chunk of change, but you needed it back quickly. Then you said that you didn't actually need the money back. Now, you have said that you bought video cards instead of bitcoins, despite every other post in this conversation implying that you had bitcoins, and you have basically abandoned the idea that you bought bitcoins because you were poor. On top of that, you have said that you took a risk and that you did not take a risk in the same post.
I'm glad it worked out for you, but this conversation makes absolutely no sense. If you constantly change your story, it makes it very difficult to have an discussion around how bitcoin can be good or bad for investors.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:42:03
Because volatility is bad for anything that wants to be used as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:43:55
I'm glad that it worked out for you, but your reasoning doesn't make a lot of sense. Buying and selling stocks is a pretty quick process. Furthermore, if you need to recover money quickly, you should probably not be investing it. What's more, if you feel that you have to make a short term investment, something as volatile as bitcoin is not the place to put money that you will need in the near future. People who do things like that are the reason that people voted a suicide hotline to the front of this subreddit earlier today.
It may have worked out for you this time, but you're approaching an already dangerous game with a losing strategy.

If gold was no longer useful for anything else, it would not be a commodity. Fortunately, the physical and chemical properties of gold ensure that it can be used for things such as electronics, even if there are better commodities to use for that purpose.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:09:55
Actually, I do. A bitcoins value is purely in it's use as a medium for exchange or as a store of value. This means that it is fiat money. If it can no longer be used for these two things, it is useless, meaning that it has no intrinsic value.
Commodity money is money that has value as a medium for exchange, a store of value, and for other uses. Gold, for example, is a commodity and it is money. It can be used for exchanges, storing value, jewelry, art, electronics, etc. Other commodity moneys that have been popular in history include silver, salt, grains, animal skins, etc.
Do some research before spreading misinformation like that.

I think so too, which is why I'm not very active in bitcoin the moment (despite seeing a lot of value in the usefulness of bitcoin).
This is primarily anecdotal, of course. All of the people I know in person (&lt;10) who bought bitcoin did it to try to increase the value of their money and sell it at a later date. On top of that, I get the impression from a lot of bitcoin forums that most people who buy it are trying to cash in on the growth.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:11:37
Perhaps, but that certainly isn't helping bitcoin's case. Misinformation about basic economic concepts among core users should be considered a bad thing.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:34:21
As explained earlier, I get what the word "fiat" means. Fiat money is named what it is due to it's origins, but it's origins to not define what it is or has become. You will find a number of names or words in the english language that are named for a certain thing without literally being what that thing is.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:12:00
Hah, if you were at 100% bitcoin before, you're still there (and I feel bad for you).
I don't think BTC should be a substantial percentage of anybody's portfolio. It is an incredibly volatile item, and the stock market as a whole has a stable upward trend at the moment.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:23:22
Feel free to provide the actual definition if you think I am wrong. I'm not a hobbyist.
