We could have just seen a peak and it's crashing now or it could be a tiny dip that's going to lead to another ATH. No one knows. If you're gonna hold for a long haul, buy whenever, if you're going for short term profit, I'd wait.

Uh... How is it? Old investors aren't being paid money from new investors. There are a set amount of coins that can be traded at will. There is no middle man (unless you use an exchange) that would set up this Ponzi scheme. It is a currency, just one that doesn't exist in the physical world. 
Now a Ponzi scheme could be set up on Bitcoin, but in the same way it could be set up on USD. The Bitcoin would not be the scheme but rather the funding.

Invest half now and half when/if it goes down. You want to spread your investment out so you don't buy all high if this is a peak but you also don't want to be waiting for a dip that never happens.

Yeah, if you're gonna hold and want to keep it off exchanges, transfer from Coinbase to GDAX and then from GDAX to your wallet of choice.

Only invest what you can afford to lose. If you don't have it, you can't afford to lose it.

Move it how? You can move it to GDAX for free if you want to trade it and can also move it from GDAX to a wallet or ledger for free.

Transfer small amounts from different places so that it can't be tracked to a single source.
