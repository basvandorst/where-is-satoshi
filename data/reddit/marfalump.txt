A bold move.  Publishing a large picture of your QR bitcoin public address on canvas, and selling it as art for others to hang on their wall.

I own physical gold, as well as bitcoin.  I like then for the same reason - there is a limited supply and they can protect my money from inflation.

A hard fork is a split of the blockchain.  It has non-backwards compatible code due to miner disagreement.  Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold were hard forks.
A soft fork is when code changes are adopted gradually because they are backwards compatible.
Litecoin is a software fork.  This means the code is essentially copied, but not the blockchain/ledger.  Litecoin has it's own genesis block and it's own blockchain.

Well.....  I love bitcoin, but this is actually a case AGAINST it.  
The bank did reissue the bank draft that was lost, and the family was able to get their money back after the human error had happened.
Imagine if they had accidentally sent 800,000 to the wrong bitcoin wallet.  Maybe they changed a single character.  Again, human error.  But in the case of Bitcoin, there is no way to get it back.

This is an interesting list.
Keep in mind- Most investors have their BTC in multiple addresses/wallets.  So it doesn't really mean that only ~18000 people have 100 BTC or more.    The number would be greater.

That is a matter of opinion.  
Conservative/libertarian economists and politicians tend to disagree.
"Even Greenspan admits this is the case with debt: "We would never have reached this position of extreme indebtedness were we on the gold standard, because the gold standard is a way of ensuring that fiscal policy never gets out of line."

most US dollars are used for regular goods, most Bitcoins are used for illegals stuff
The movement of bitcoin is tracked on a public ledger, which makes it a poor choice for criminals.  But just like any currency- a few people will use it to buy bad stuff.
I wouldn't ever want the US government to do away with cash, yet cash is completely anonymous.  I don't have the stats, but I'd imagine most illegal drug deals are cash based.  It's far safer for the criminal.  


The limited supply is the appealing part to me.  They can't devalue my savings by just printing more.  
I'm not one f those "down with the banking system" guys, but I like having an alternate choice that's protected from inflation.

@_date: 2017-12-13 02:46:04
This is true.  But gold, generally speaking, has had a somewhat predictable (and limited) supply.  And the rate of money printing is much more alarming.
Gold has been a store of value for thousand of years.  Bitcoin is a good store of value too.  I own both.
The thing about crypto - While bitcoin has a limited supply of tokens, cryptocurrencies as a whole do not.  We need to see if the general public clings to Bitcoin as a true store of value, or if the value is eventually dispersed over many currencies.

Most criminals use US dollars for this, not bitcoin or gold.  Bitcoin is not nearly as anonymous as US dollars.  (Because transactions are recorded on the blockchain.)  And gold is simply too inconvenient to buy drugs and guns.


Who said anything about 30%?  You can loan US dollars, cryptocurrency, or gold at any interest rate at all.

They could achieve this by changing the spelling or by changing the name slightly.  Free MahKit.  Free BitMarket.  I'm not a branding expert, but you get the idea. :)
But calling it DarkMarket - The general public who knows nothing about it besides the name will want it banned.  People will be afraid to use it.

Seriously, the name really does matter.

I agree.  But sadly, if these were posted outside of a "Moronic Monday" thread, they'd be downvoted into oblivion.
I am interested in bitcoin, but I am afraid to ask similar questions on my own.  Bitcoin is very technical and confusing, but many people seem to believe that these answers are easily Google-able, which I would disagree.

My dumb question - When I create a paper wallet (on a site like bitcoinpaperwallet.com), it asks me to move my mouse. Evidently there is some entropy thing that helps determine randomness through my mouse movements.
How is this randomness created in coins held by exchanges?  (I think they back them up on paper wallets, right?)  I doubt someone is sitting at Bitstamp's headquarters whose job it is to move their mouse around for entropy.

I made some paper wallets over a year ago.  I was new, didn't know what I was doing- just kind of experimenting. 
I put .001 BTC (or some small amount) in a wallet created with bitcoinpaperwallet.com.
I did it on my work computer which was connected to the Internet.  The printer was a network printer.  (I own the printer and the computer... and the company. No one else that works here knows how to use bitcoin.)
If I were to do it again, I wouldn't do it on an Internet connected computer.  But since this happened over a year ago and the paper wallet is still loaded, can I reasonably assume that it'll be safe in the long-term?

Reality check:  I think, if he hasn't heard of bitcoins, he's not likely to jump on board in the near future.
The best business owners to convince are those who have heard of bitcoins, and have expressed an interest in them.  Tech savvy and libertarian owners are more likely to accept too.
Think of it this way:
- He's a busy guy.  He's probably not as tech savvy as most people in this forum.  Do you think he wants to spend months learning about BTC?  Probably not.
- If he were to jump onboard and accept bitcoin, would he sell more sandwiches?  Maybe a few, but probably only a fraction of a percent.
- Does he want to train all of his employees?  He'd have to explain bitcoin to them all, and show them all how to uses it.
- Customers would regularly ask him about bitcoins and why he accepts them.  Does he want to answer this all day and explain bitcoins to customers?  Probably not. Would he be able to explain bitcoin to everyone?  Probably not.
It's not what people in this subreddit like to hear, but it is the truth.  
I hope to see more businesses jump on board too, but I think we need to be realistic about our expectations.  99% of all locally owned and operated sandwich shops don't know what bitcoin is and won't support it until it's more mainstream.
However, there ARE business owners who might accept bitcoins if they hear customers talking about them.  Who are they?
- tech savvy business owners
- people who know about bitcoins because they follow financial news
- someone who is "fed up" with chargebacks and fees
- someone who likes exploring new technologies
- businesses who need/want a little extra media attention for doing something unusual

It's an interesting idea, but I think the brand association with Gox would hurt more than help.  
If they were interested in going into the bitcoin exchange business (which I don't think they are), they'd be better off creating their own exchange from scratch.  People would trust an exchange with Facebook's reputation tied to it.  They would not trust an exchange with the MtGox brand tied to it.

I own a few bitcoins, but I don't know much about mining or the back-end workings of the bitcoin protocol.  (I understand the basic concepts, but not the details.)
Today I see a reddit story headline that reads:


I've also seen headlines in the past the read:


Are these types of problems/worries going to be on-going as long as bitcoins exist?  
It makes bitcoin seem pretty unstable if these stories will repeat themselves year after year.  I mean, it seems to suggest that sooner or later there will be a major 51% attack, or maybe not enough nodes.
In time, are the number of "close calls" from the mining world likely to dwindle?

@_date: 2014-01-02 00:59:12
It's legit.  Volatile, but definitely legit.
You can spend bitcoins on reddit (gold), okcupid, wordpress, and even VirginGalactic.  Overstock.com plans to accept bitcoin sometime in the next few months.  More and more mom and pop shops are accepting them too.
Bitcoin is regularly written about in USA today and Forbes.  It's often discussed on CNBC and FoxBusiness.  
In recent hearings, the US Senate seemed to be open-minded.  There was no suggestion that they are, or should be illegal.  (Though increased regulation is to be expected, of course.)
It's still early, and it's not widely adopted yet.  However, mant here think it as the potential to be a major international currency in the future.  
As an investment, it is speculative and even risky to buy bitcoins.  The markets rise and fall like crazy. If you bought in Jan of 2013, your BTC would have gone up 5000%.  But if you bought in at 1200 in November/December, your investment is worth only 800 now.
However, I encourage you to read about the technology behind bitcoin.  That's why I'm so bullish about its future.  I think it may change the way the world thinks about and uses money.

I love my 2014 Kialara, and I ordered the 2015 as soon as you sent the email about the ebay auction going up.  Can't wait to receive it.
I am truly impressed by the craftsmanship and materials used.  The detailed, 3-dimensional designs are beautiful to look at.  The weight makes them impressive to hold. My Kialara is displayed in my office and it's a great conversation piece.  Everyone who holds it is intrigued and curious.
Two Small Bits of Constructive criticism (pun intended):
 1  
The one thing I am not a fan of is the "remove when funded" tag.  See, if I remove the tag, the art is (partly) destroyed.  And the value of the art goes down while the bitcoin value goes up.  Since it's meant to store bitcoin, I want to load it.... And if I don't load it, it's not really a useful as a physical bitcoin.  I want my Kialara to be "real" money with real value, but I don't want to ruin it too.  
I loaded mine, kept the tag in place, and stuck a yellow post-it that says "loaded."  So, mine's Loaded, but I didn't have to damage it by pulling the tag.  
I think the tag makes it more confusing.  I wish there was no tag and I could just check the first bits online (like Casascius).
Furthermore, the tag is delicate.  As I mentioned before, it's displayed in my office.  I invite people to examine it.  But I always cringe when people pick it up because I fear they will accidentally break the tag off.
 2  
My second criticism is that it's only meant to be funded with .1 BTC.  This thing FEELS important.  And it LOOKS valuable.  So, when people see this thing in my office, they pick it up and ask what it is.  I tell them it stores bitcoin.  Their reaction is usually "Wow!  So how much bitcoin does it store?"  And then I say, "Well, only about 30 bucks worth."  I think the quality of the piece calls for a higher BTC value to be deposited in it.  I'd prefer one designed to hold 1 whole btc, or at least .5.
Anyway, I love my Kialara, but I wanted to share my opinions. Keep up the amazing work.  I'm a customer for life.  Looking forward to receiving my 2015, 2016, and beyond.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:43:59

I was reading about [double spending]( and I'd like to know more about the practical logistics about how a malicious person could double spend.
I don't see how someone could do it.  They go to Overstock and spend some coins.  Then they go to alpaca socks and spend the same coins.  But wouldn't they be "caught" before any product is received? Everyone would know and it'd be on page 1 of reddit within minutes, right?
Similarly, wouldn't someone have to double spend a huge amount of money to make it worthwhile?  And, if this were the case, wouldn't the receiver need/want a crazy number of confirmations before considering it truly "confirmed?"  I mean, if I sell someone a house for 10000 bTC, i'm not going to accept a transaction with only 3 or 4 confirmations, right?
Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question, but I'm just trying to figure out how it would work in the real world.

I'd say a coin that demanded a 5.6 BTC price is pretty precious.
I think we would agree that they should grade a 500 year-old brass coin.  Why not a brass bitcoin?
We know they'll grade a 2012 double die Lincoln shield penny.  Why not a bitcoin that is similarly aged?
And the Casascius coin demands a higher price than either of those.  Because it was made in someone's house, and not a government mint, it is less precious?

I agree that we MIGHT see economic collapse in our lifetime.  But it seems like the gold and silver resellers of the world love to fantasize about this scenario.

I'll probably get downvoted for this, but...
I think OP's post is great.  Spot-on analysis of the potential problems with paper wallets.  But, at least in my case, they're all very unlikely.  If you take reasonable precautions, you don't need to be paranoid.
I print one copy of each wallet while offline using a downloaded version of Canton Becker's site.  I don't save the private key in digital form.  I always use my own, personal computers and printers at home.  I don't have malware on my computer.  I honestly don't think anyone is spying on my wifi network activity.  My paper wallets have all held all of their value for many, many years.  
Honestly,  I bet I could leave paper wallets filled with money all around my home... all over my workplace... and plastered on telephone poles all over my street.  Noone would understand what they are.  Noone would care.  (I don't recommend this, of course.  I am just saying that in my real-life circle of friends/family, I'm the only one who has any idea what bitcoin is.)
I would be much more fearful with hardware wallets.  I am a long-term holder, so I am more worried about technology becoming obsolete or losing data... or me forgetting passwords.
Imagine if bitcoin were around 30 years ago (1987) and I stored it on 5.25" floppy disks or an old 20mb hard drive.  The data would be long gone.  Even if it weren't, the technology to recover it would be difficult to secure.  And even if I could secure it, hardly anyone would know how to use it.  BUT, if it were printed, and stored in a safe... I'd have it.
Some people feel more comfortable with digital btc on hardware wallets.  Me, I like paper for long-term holdings.

Robert Herjavec - Tulips.  Illegal activity.  No, I'm not going to invest in bitcoin.  Criminals use bitcoin.

We need regulation.
Mark Cuban  - I have a little bitcoin, but blockchain is where's at.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain.
Kevin O'Leary on bitcoin - Bitcoin won't pay me a dividend and I love dividends.

When you buy it, don't keep it on an exchange.  You should control the private key.

The first time I saw the "move your mouse for randomness" thing, I was confused as hell.  I'd never seen it before.  
I'm still not sure I fully understand the connection to randomness on the bitcoin wallet.  (So I moved my mouse around? How does that convert to a public/private key?)  
But it's fun to moved my mouse chaotically around the screen, so I just go with it.

Even so, I don't know that Mike (Casascius) didn't handle them either.  He probably had his paws on the when he sorted them or put them in the air-tite capsules.   (I can't blame him.  I doubt he considered how collectible they'd truly be.  I wouldn't have guessed either when I bought them.)

I can't speak for Trezor because I do not have one.  My long-term holdings are on paper.  My short-term, spendable coins are on Coinbase.
A paper wallet, in its simplest terms works like this:  You use a site like bitcoinpaperwallet.com to generate a paper wallet.  The paper wallet has a public key and a private key.  Then use coinbase to send the bitcoins to the public address on the paper wallet.
(For security, they recommend using an offline computer.  Avoid work printers and open networks.  Other security precautions are posted on the site where you generate the wallets.)
You could generate a wallet like this anywhere.  It doesn't even have to be on paper.  You could open a word file and save the public/private key there.  And send money to the public key.  Then store the files on a flash drive.  It's essentially the same thing.
Generally, storing Coinbase is fine.  But beware:  If anything happens to Coinbase, you're screwed.  I trust them to hold small amounts.  But I wouldn't try keeping thousands of dollars in there long term.

@_date: 2017-05-08 19:25:52


Not really.  You can buy them from many different places.  I use Coinbase.com because they're one of the easiest places to buy.  They have a friendly UX that looks and works a lot like paypal.
Also, you don't need to buy a whole Bitcoin at once.  You can buy .5 bitcoin for $800.  .25 bitcoins for $400.  0.1 bitcoin for $160.  Whatever you'd like.  Bitcoins can be broken all the way down to one "satoshi" which is worth ~~one-tenth of one cent~~ 0.0002 of one cent right now.  (Of course, I don't think Coinbase will sell you only one satoshi.  I don't know what their minimum is.)


Oh gosh no. To be a miner, you'd need special hardware, cheap electricity, and lots of technical know-how. For the average user, you cannot make money mining bitcoin. You're better off buying it.
[This picture]( shows a serious bitcoin mining operation.  Though if you really want to try it, there are minepools.  Probably not for the beginner.  Just buy your bitcoin like the rest of us. :)
If you buy a bitcoin, you need to transfer it to your own personal wallet.  (You can keep it on Coinbase, but that's not recommended.  Services like Coinbase have gone out of business in the past, taking people's coins with them.  So you want to take it off their site and into a personal wallet you control.)
Most people use digital wallets, like [Trezor](  Personally, I use [paper wallets]( If you buy/sell/spend a Trezor will be your best bet.  I'm a long-term holder who likes to lock his bitcoin in a safe.  I also keep small amounts (less than half a bitcoin) in my Coinbase account so I can buy/sell from there.

Another question:  When uTorrent included a miner, everyone on the sub flipped out and called them shady.  But if my TV has a miner, why is it a good thing?
I'm a novice, but I was under the impression that more miners just increased the difficulty.  Fewer miners means lower difficulty.  As long as we have enough miners to keep the blockchain alive, why do we need them in everyday appliances?

Well, these people were asked, in a quite straightforward way, "Which do you want?"  It's like saying, "You're on camera.  We're testing your judgement.  Which is more valuable to you?"
Anecdotally, in my circle of family and friends, nobody has any desire to own gold, silver, or bitcoin.  They might technically know these things have some value, but they have no idea how much.  And anything other than USD might as well be an old lead pipe.  Just a useless thing they wouldn't know what to do with.
I, of course, would take the gold.  I'm sure my own wife would prefer the candy bar.  
When I got excited about bitcoin hitting 1800 the other say, she shrugged and didn't care.  I asked why.  She said, "You never buy anything with it.  It just sits there.  It's just some stupid numbers on a computer.  Nobody cares."

The smartest investors do not buy on emotion.  Right now there is a lot of excitement because the price is high.  It might climb tomorrow.  It might drop a little tomorrow.
Ask yourself:  Do I think bitcoin will be more valuable or less valuable in 1 year?  5 years?  10 years?  If you think it will be less valuable, don't invest.  If you think it will be more valuable, then don't get all caught up in predicting when it will rise or fall in the short term.

I already created a blockchain wallet yesterday.  I put a few cents of tip money in it from you and the other kind people in this thread.  It wasn't nearly as hard as I thought.

Yes, I did notice that Coinbase let's you send BTC to an email address.  I haven't used the feature, but it looks convenient.  I believe it only works after you've already had a transaction with someone, correct?
PayPal and credit cards will probaby be a challenge for the forseeable future, unfortunately.  And that's going to be the roadblock that keeps BTC out of the mainstream public's hands for awhile, unfortunately.

1.  I will look into coinbase.  TY.
2.  I think if I were focused I could organize and handle bitcoins well.  Cash - I'm always dropping/losing small amounts of cash in pockets, in my car, on my desk, on the dresser.  So yes.  But it's small amounts.  A dollar here and there.  Larger amounts of money, of course, is in banks.  I suppose bitcoin would be the same - and larger amount would be secured with more care.
3.  It will be interesting to see the government's stand in the future.  However, I suppose it's best to get in earlier.
4.  I have no idea.  I live in a small town, so I doubt there are any real bitcoin communities in the area.
5.  Well said.  I look forward to watching the Mike Hearn video.

No matter how many bitcoins I have, this would be a tragic situation.  Millions would be out of work as large companies collapse, people's life savings would be wiped out, and we'd be in an economic depression.  I don't want to see this happen to fellow Americans.  I wish bitcoiners would stop speaking about the collapse of the dollar as if it would be a positive thing.
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:22:26
Instead of playing around with mining, i'd suggest buying some bitcoins and making some online purchases with them.

If all fiat money becomes worthless, the bitcoin community will consist of almost everyone on earth.  Well, everyone who is not penniless.
That said, I agree and support your point.  Yes, those with wealth have a responsibility to help others who are less fortunate.
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:02:30
I do own a business.  And I want to accept bit coins.  But 99.9% of my customers have probably never heard of bitcoin.  And if a significant number were to pay with bit coin, we'd have to "cash out" regularly in order to cover payroll and expenses.
For moral/ethical/political principle reasons, I think bit coins are a great idea.  But I'm not convinced they're a realistic currency for American business or for long term investment.
@_date: 2013-08-18 04:54:21
So it is dependent on the existence of other currencies or hard commodities?
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:06:40
Of course it can be outlawed.  Well, using them can be outlawed.
All congress had to do is pass a law that says American citizens cannot use hit coin.  Anyone caught using them gets punished with jail or fines  or whatever.
Congress outlawed gold ownership at one point.  They can outlaw this too.
Maybe they can't prevent it or shut it down, but they can outlaw it and force it into secret underground usage.
I'd like to think it would remain legal... But I wouldn't bet on it.  Government likes to hold onto its power and control people and te economy.  Bitcoin threatens this power.

@_date: 2013-11-08 01:58:21
I don't think this will happen.  While I am bullish on bitcoin, I don't believe it will truly lead to the demise of fiat currency.  At least not in our  lifetimes.
I think it's a niche currency that is growing into a strong alternate currency for those who need/want it.  The dollar will contine to be devalued, gradually, but I don't see any real evidence of a severe crash or hyperinflation.
However, let's say for the sake of hypothetical argument, that bitcoin somehow does become the only real, practical currency left on planet earth.  
Does bitcoin have a responsibility to those who are less fortunate?  No, because bitcoin is a currency.  It has not feeling.  It has no brain.
Will government take care of the less fortunate?  Well, if government curency becomes worthless, it is unlikely that they will be able to afford many social programs.
That leaves individuals like you and me.  We are responsible for ourselves and our families first and foremost.  And, if we're alright, we can extend our responsibility by voluntarily supporting our communities and strangers.
Grandma doesn't have bitcoins and her fiat currency is worthless? Her family will hopefully care for her. (I'd certainly be there for MY grandma.  Wouldn't you help yours?)  If grandma's family can't or won't help, that's where charitable friends and strangers can step up.  (If I knew about someone in need, I'd do my part to help.  I think most people would.)
People do care for others, even without government force.

@_date: 2013-10-20 02:16:39
It would require a level or trust or verification, of course.  I think the reason that so few people actually buy them is because no one really wants to do a bank transfer (if they even know how).
I don't know the solution of HOW to make this happen.  A bitcoin transaction cannot be reversed, but a credit card transaction can.  
Without allowing people to buy them with a credit card, it will be hard to get the general public onboard.  
@_date: 2013-08-18 04:44:52

1.  Perhaps I will do this. 
2.  See, it's information/data, and I'm a scatterbrain clutter bug.  I'm a messy desk kind of person.  I'd have bitcoin information on post its.  On envelopes.  On napkins.  And a few on thumb drives.  And then there'd be bitcoin data that I emailed myself and I can't find.  I do this with real money too - but when I drop quarters in the cup holder of my car, they're easy to pick up when I clean my car out.  When I leave a ten dollar bill in my pocket and wash my jacket, I still have a ten dollar bill.  Seems to me like bitcoin is for organized people.  Again, this is a problem with ME, not bitcoin.  But I suspect others may have this problem too.
3.  Glad to hear you think US is warming up to bitcoin.  Mind if I ask why you think this is so?

She's right, though.  It's not practical for a person in her situation because there's not much she can buy.

@_date: 2013-12-07 08:12:55
Yes, I agree with you.  But the news will latch on to the crash story and they'll go on and on about extreme volatility.  Probably mention drugs and tulips.  And scare away potential adopters for the time being.
Long term, BTC will be fine.  In the short term, it's going to be a messy news week.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:04:41
I'd subscribe to and/or I enjoy the serious side of bitcoin too, and I think serious discussion and analysis is important.  (BTW: I subscribe to It tends to have more serious articles and discussions.)
However, this sub is a first-stop for many on their path to learning about bitcoin.  If it's too serious all the time, I think it could scare people away.  An occasional meme or "to the moon" post is something the general public can understand.  It pulls them in.  Makes them want to learn more.
If I was a newbie who had stumbled across OP's image, I'd be asking, "What would make someone roll their eyes like that?  Why does everyone think it's funny?  Let's explore this bitcoin thing more."
And, if I'm on my couch at night (as I am now), browsing reddit while watching television and talking to my wife all at the same time, I'm not going to be as focused on the serious stuff.
I guess it's personal preference.  However, at this time, I'm okay with the content posted here.
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:30:59
It certainly would be a fun and interesting way to diversify a portfolio.  I'm not against putting in a few bucks and giving it a try, or allowing my business to accept bitcoins.  
However, in your opinion, is it a smart way to invest any significant amount of money?  I can't answer this question, but I am curious to know if people see it as a novel way to invest a small sum and throw some support behind free, decentralized currency....  Or if people regard it as a real way to invest big bucks?  The former seems like a charity.  The latter seems a bit risky.
@_date: 2013-10-03 22:54:18
Thanks for the tip.  +gold to you.
This might sound like a dumb question, but why do you call it irreversible payment method?  Just as a company can refund a credit card, one who accepts a bitcoin can always send it back, correct?  I'd think trust would be required whenever any payment is charged.  However, since bitcoin is decentralized, you cannot rely on a company to hold/refund charges.  So I guess it would be more like cash in that regard.
@_date: 2013-10-19 13:17:01
It's not that they can't grasp the concept, it's that when they first hear about bitcoin they will instinctively compare it to the dollar (or euro or pound or whatever local currency they use).  This is what I did early on too, before I understood it.
Take the US dollar, for instance.  We have hundred dollar bills.  We've even had thousand dollar bills.  And we have pennies.  But dollar is the name of the currency.  It's a small amount that everyone can afford.  But what if the dollar was based on the value of a thousand dollar bill?  A loaf of bread would cost .00205 dollars.  A 25 cent pack of gum would cost .000025 dollars.  The decimal just seems a bit too small to be practical.  People with old, tired eyes (like mine) have to count the 0s very carefully.
Also, people will want to buy into something that they can own at least one of.  Not .5 or .25.  People often buy [one share]( of a stock even though they could buy a fraction of a share.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:31:09

@_date: 2013-10-27 23:26:24
Agreed.  I saw this awhile back.  The website was kind of vague about the details, so I emailed them.  Tracking ownership wasn't the only annoying "feature."
Apparently they don't give you a key on the coin, like Casasicus coins.  You need to scan a code into their website to get the money back.  If their website disappears, then no money for you.
Seems like they're trying to centralize a bit of a decentralized currency.
I do like the idea of physical coins, but I want the actual key.  I'll stick with Casasicus for now.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:14:21
I think the pictures of Casascius coins are a good starting point for conversation.  You can explain the the coins themselves aren't the bitcoin.  The bitcoin is the virtual currency that can be accessed by using the private key that's on a sticker on the coin.
Then tell them bitcoin is a protocol, like email and http.   The physical coin is like a printed email.  The email exists online even if you don't print it out.  Similarly, the bitcoin exists online, whether or not its in its physical form.
For those who insist that currency needs to be physical, explain that you can print paper wallets loaded with BTC if you want to.
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:42:29

Bitcoin is complex and very difficult for a beginner to understand.  The question is a good one, and not one that is answered in most introductory videos and websites.

My reaction is not based only on recent headlines, but on the fact government cannot control it.  And government likes to outlaw or regulate everything.  
I'm thinking more about Chuck Schumer's reaction.  He thinks it's money laundering.  He is, of course, clueless.  But I think most/many government officials believe this, and most Americans don't understand it, so there is fear among some people.  And far leads to.... Outlawing and or regulation, does it not?
Better question:  where do you think bit coins will be in 5 years.  (In USA). Unregulated, like today?  Somewhat regulated?  Or outlawed?
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:52:20
Bitcoin is real money.
Is it better than fiat currency, like US dollars or Euros? It depends how you define "better." 
In many ways it is because it's not controlled by government or a central bank.  And it's not subject to inflation because there is a limited supply.
On the downside, it's not mainstrean yet, so there are fewer places to spend it.  Also, the value fluctuates quickly and often.

@_date: 2013-12-17 00:58:27
What country are you in?
If you're in the USA, just sign up for Coinbase.  They're a trusted, reputable company.  Just like psypal, you enter your bank account details and whenever you buy, the oney will be withdrawn from your account.  When you sell, they'll deposit money.
The downside is that if you're new, it'll take a week or so to receive the btcoins.  (Don't worry.  It's not a scam.  It's just a security measure to prevent you from buying bitcoins, then doing a chargeback.)  It's an inconvenience, but in the end Coinbase is a reliable and easy way to buy and sell.
Because bitcoin is still a relatively new currency, anyone who buys and sells in an early adopter.  There aren't a lot of companies to offer simple buy/sell services just yet.
Think of it like using the Internet in 1992.  You could do it, but it took some effort and knowhow.  Today it's second nature to everyone.  Bitcoin is the same way.  We're in the early stages now, but bitcoin could become easier and more widespread in just a few years.  If this happens, early investors will be rewarded financially.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:33:44
I'm not sure.  For Coinbase, the decision will probably be determined by which units make the most money in sales.  A lot of people on reddit want the switch (as do I), but sites like Coinbase aren't going to make nearly as much profit on two dollar purchases as they will on $800+ purchases.
@_date: 2013-10-09 18:50:36
Lost gold can (and will) be found again.  Lost Bitcoins are gone forever.
When someone sees gold, it is not thrown out.  Everyone knows what it is and everyone knows it's valuable.  In contrast, if someone stumbles across a bitcoin key, they probably won't know what it is.  It is more likely to be discarded.
If someone doesn't see gold right away, it's only a matter of time before someone rediscovers it.  Gold that was lost at sea hundreds of years ago is rediscovered by divers today.  If gold is buried in the yard, someone will eventually find it with a metal detector.  Gold is never destroyed.  Bitcoins, on the other hand, can be lost forever.
However this causes deflation, which makes the value of everyone else's bitcoins to increase.  And since a bitcoin is infinitely divisible, prices can adjust accordingly.

The graphics are eye catching and she did a marvelous job of explaining BTC to beginners.  I like how she included the graph and explained that they're talked about in the media, like CNBC.
If you ever do another display like this in the future , let me know and I'll send you some BTC hologram stickers for the paper wallet.  (So you don't have to use electrical tape.)  I'd send 'em to you now, but I doubt they'd arrive by Thursday.

This does help.  Thank you.
Just opened an online wallet to deposit a couple of bitcoin tips.  Easier than I thought.
Coinbase - a couple people mentioned it.  Originally I thought they were mainly for merchants.  Now I see that I can buy/sell with a bank account.  Pretty cool - perhaps I'll give it a try with a all amount.
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:55:02
While I agree with you, it's not the general public on reddit or bitcointalk forums that can make this change.  It's the exchanges and the buy/sell sites, like Mt. Gox, Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc.
When the price is listed in mBTC, then people will starting using mBTC as the primary units.  Of course, no exchange is anxious to be the first to switch the units of measure.
Best way to do this:  Write e-mails to the exchanges and bitcoin sites you use the most.

It depends who you're selling to, and how much you have.
0.25 BTC - No problem.  It's worth $200 USD or so at today's price.  There will always be a buyer.  You can sell it through an exchange or a buy/sell site like coinbase.  Or sell it directly yourself.
Super small amounts might be trickier.  If you have .000001 BTC, maybe it's not worth the time to sell it for half a penny.  And buyers might not find it worthwhile to buy. (If you had a common 2011 penny, would you be able to find a buyer if you listed it on craigslist or ebay?  Probaby not.)
 Coinbase has a ten cent USD buying minimum.  I think the selling minimum might be the same, not sure.

Banks may be able to make storing bitcoins easier, allowing users to deposit and withdraw coins without complex addresses or keys.  They can issue debit cards and credit cards to make BTC easier to spend.  Then might even be able to issue loans in BTC.  They can simplify bitcoins, which would make them more appealing to the masses.


 I think perhaps more people would want to own them if a good bank were available.


And there are alternatives to keeping you life savings under the mattress... you know, banks.  :)

Looks like a cool product!  I use long term physical storage, and paper makes me nervous because it's vulnerable to fire and water.
1.  You say it's a "pressure compact laminate."  Is it plastic or metal.  (Looks metal, but I can't tell.)
2.  Can you post more pictures of different colors?  
3.  Why are the colors random?  Why no choice?
4.  Is there a place to handwrite my deposits so I know how much is in there?
5.  To win people's trust Casascius posts his real name and address.  Would you consider doing this?
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:14:21
For me, watching bitcoin rise and fall has become an interesting hobby.  The technology is sound and I think it's only a matter of time before it becomes mainstream.
Invest what you can afford to lose, but not a penny more.  It is volatile and nobody really knows what it will do.

I thought deflation could be as bad as inflation.  It can lead to fewer people borrowing and/or lower production.  
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:15:05
Physical bitcoins (aka cold storage) can take a few different forms:
 - paper (usually printed on your own printer)
 - a physical coin (silver or aluminum or copper or even gold)
A physical bitcoin basically has the public address and a private key.  It is recorded on the blockchain.  To redeem it, you need the private key.  If you don't have the private key, you don't have the money.
Any time the private key is physically printed, it is in the physical bitcoin form.
Casascius would sell physical bitcoins.  You'd pay him in bitcoin and he'd send you a real coin.  The public key was on a hologram sticker on the back.  To see the private key, you'd peel the sticker off.
As long as the sticker wasn't peeled, you could assume that no one has redeemed the coin and it was still worth face value.
He'd sell them in several denominations, including .1 BTC, .5 BTC, 1 BTC, 10 BTC, 25 BTC etc.

If I go for a meal with my family, I'd have to pay separately for each meal and drink.  I think I'd rather have one check to pay at the end.
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:52:40
Interesting way to look at it.
I think because the world uses inflationary fiat currency, we've never (in modern times) had the opportunity to look at "cash money" as an investment.
@_date: 2013-10-28 02:26:15
Most of my coins are in my digital wallet, but I do have a few physical bitcoins too.  I'm a numismatist, so Casasicus coins appeal to dual interests in my case.
Also, for long-term saving, I do think physical coins are safer than personal hard drives, USB sticks, and online companies.
@_date: 2013-10-26 07:11:02
Actually, bitcoins should be deflationary over a long period of time.  Supply of coins will decrease as people permanently lose private keys.  (How are private keys lost?  Computer hard drives are sometime ruined.  People will die and not pass along their bitcoins.  People will forget about some coins.  Etc.)
Not to worry, though.  This simply means the remaining coins should be worth more.
And, since bitcoins are divisible into tiny fractions, the remaining supply will always be enough for people to own and use bitcoins.

Interesting to see his guest bring it up in conversation, rather than Keiser. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:01:43
Honestly, though, many current bitcoin users who are hoarding coins like the larger number.  Psychologically, it sounds more fun to say, "Each bitcoin I own is worth $850" rather than "Each mBTC is worth 85 cents."
However, when it comes to buying new units of money, 85 cents sounds a lot better than $850.

I own a company and I do not accept bitcoin.  (I buy them and use them personally, but not for my company.)
Here's why:
1.  Training.  I'm not going to spend valuable company time trying to train 10 employees on bitcoin.  Most don't understand it.  A few wouldn't be able to understand it.  It's just not practical.
2.  No real increase in business/customers.  The number of customers it would add in my particular niche would be pretty close to zero.  My business is doing well with cash and credit cards.  Why mess with it?  Maybe someday when it's more mainstream we will, but not right now.
3.  Reputation.  You and I know that bitcoins are perfectly legal and they are (possibly) the future of money.  But many people don't.  When some people see the word bitcoin, they think of silk road, drugs, and money laundering.  (Blame the mainstream media.)  I don't want my customers to think about these things when they're making a purchase from my business.  I am trying to develop a reputation that we're a trusted company.
Yes, there are a lot of upsides too.  But you requested the drawbacks, and those are the major ones in my opinion.

Confession:  I sort of hope it goes back down so I can buy more.  I don't want to buy more coins when the price spikes like this.
When I have a large hoard and I'm bored of buying, then I want it to go up. :)

I share your interest in the economic side of bitcoin, which is why I invest.  And you're spot on - it is a grand experiment.  It could explode, like the world wide web... or it could flop, like Napoleon's metric units of time.
Personally I don't know what it'll do, but I'm having fun watching BTC develop and following the buzz.
Regardless of whether or not he think it'll be successful in the long term, I'm surprised he's not intrigued by the CS aspect of it.  I'm surprised his colleagues aren't discovering it too.  Perhaps we are the earliest of adopters.
My best advice to win him over might be to remind him that you're genuinely interested in the CS and economic aspects of bitcoins, and let him know that you're only investing a little bit to see what happens.
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:11:26
I'm not so sure about the comparison with gold.
Bitcoin is meant to be spent.  It can (should?) be used as currency in brick-and-mortar stores and online businesses.
Gold is a commodity, a natural resource, an element.  Gold is natural.
People invest in gold.  People spend money.  It seems like everyone's saying "bitcoin is money" but then they save it and invest in it like gold.

While I agree the coins can be misleading to people who don't understand, they are the face of bitcoin.  The media needs graphics and props, and Casascius created the coin with the intention of trying to make an object to represent intangible concept.
Early on Ron Paul was skeptical of bitcoin's value and he said, "You can't hold bitcoins in your hand."  Casascius said, "Ron Paul, yes you CAN hold bitcoins in your hand."
Some people need to think of it as a coin to understand it.

My moronic question (which I asked on Monday, but didn't get a real answer) - 
What is the origin of the phrase "to the moon" in the bitcoin community?  Who is "to the moon guy"?  What are the funny symbols that are sometimes used alongside the phrase?
Every time I see the words, "to the moon" I think of Ralph Kramden in the Honeymooners.  But I doubt that's what is being referenced.
I know it's just circlejerk meme stuff, but help me out here.  I see it too often.
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:17:40
First of all, I think it's AWESOME to see a 14 year-old who is wise enough to consider investing money.  Many 14 year-old spend everything they have on things that bring them short-term enjoyment.  You, rectum_retaliation, are going to be rich one day because you are apparently a saver, a planner, and a thinker.
I don't know how much money you have or plan to invest, but i'd recommend talking with your parents about your plans.  If they're supportive of you, they'll listen and be open-mined, as well as respectful of your decision-making skills.
If it were my kid, I wouldn't want them setting up a bank account that's directly connected to CoinBase.  And I probably wouldn't want them meeting strangers to exchange local bitcoins.  (We parents can be a little protective of kids sometimes.) I'd probably offer to buy bitcoins for them, and transfer the coins to their bitcoin wallet.
So, my advice is:
1.  Set up a BTC wallet.
2.  Ask a parent to buy bitcoins for you.  (Of course, you'd pay them cash needed to do this.)
3.  When they buy bitcoins (through coinbase or local bitcoins or wherever), they then transfer the bitcoins to your wallet.
Also - while I think bitcoins are a good investment, I would't invest everything you've got.  You know the old saying about putting all of your eggs in one basket.  In the investment world, that's called not diversifying.  Bitcoin values might go to the moon... Or they might become worthless in 10 years.
I suggest that you invest some money in bitcoin.  Invest other money in stocks or mutual funds.  Maybe even invest in a few small gold or silver bars too.
By investing in many different things, you're protecting your money, and you'll get to watch money will grow in many different ways.  When the economy is strong, your stocks may skyrocket.  When the economy is weak, your gold and bitcoins are likely to do well.  Not only will you be growing wealth, you'll learn how to monitor and manage different types of investments.
There's a lot of bitcoin hype right now, and that's all fun.  But nobody really knows whether or not this magic internet money is going to take off.  We hope it does.  But it's pure speculation at this early stage.

Thanks for the help!  I know I won't make a profit, I just want to learn how the mining aspect of bitcoin works.
Another moronic questions - Do I let it run all the time, or just at night when I'm not using my computer?
Another moronic question - Can you recommend an affordable ASIC (USB?) miner for a beginner?  Again, I'm not looking to make a profit, just something to experiment with.  When I read about them, there are so many choices it's confusing.
I wish there was a "mining for dummies" video. :)

The Casascius coins do appeal to me, especially since I am a coin collector.  I've been to his site several times.  But he only accepts bitcoins to buy bitcoins.  I saw some on eBay too, but they're much more expensive there. 
When I do have some bitcoin purchased and in my digital wallet, I would like to buy a Casascius coin.  Any idea if you can find series 1 coins for sale anywhere?
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:00:27

Nice to finally read a woman's perspective.  
I think OPs problem is that he supposedly has accumulated wealth, but he hasn't told his wife yet.  How would she feel if he said, "oh, by the way.. I have a hundr thousand in bitcoin?"  Not sure if she be mad, or thrilled.

Good point.  The newbie discussion board on Bitcointalk.org has helped me a learn great deal.
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:09:59
This.  The coin is worth more than the digital currency as long as it has not been redeemed.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:45:15
Yes.  You can buy any small amount.  Coinbase will let you buy as little as 0.10 USD worth.
It's like saying "Can you buy less than a dollar of US currency?"  Sure you can.  You can buy a quarter, dime, nickel, or penny.  In the bitcoin world, theres a bitcoin, an mBTC (.001), a uBTC (.000001) and a satoshi (.00000001).  
You can buy in any decimal increment, not just the ones named above.
Buying whole bitcoins is becoming less common as price rises.  There are plenty of discussions on this subreddit about switching to a smaller standard unit, like mBTC, which would make the price less intimidating.
So, spend a hundred dollars, twenty dollars, or ten cents, or even less than a penny's worth.  Buy a whole bitcoin, quarter of a bitcoin, or even a millionth of a bitcoin.  Because they're so divisible, you can buy tiny, tiny amounts if you want to.

Redesign looks good!  Three Suggestions (Constructive Criticism):
1.  Post some examples of sites you might subscribe to.
2.  Explain how your rates are calculated and how much it will cost.
3.  Explain that you will sign up for them and send them the login information.  (Some people might think it's an automated process, so it could be confusing.)
