Not really. Holding is just doing nothing. And while there's a right time to hold, there's also a right time to sell, at least in my opinion. And considering that the price is still falling as of now, I still feel pretty good about not having bought back in yet. We went as far down as 1070$ by now but I don't think this is the end of the road just yet. I think we will get pretty close to the 1000$ barrier, and should that one fall, then who knows where we're gonna end up. I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but this might be the beginning of the end of bitcoin as we know it. And as a bystander that's been observing both camps for a very long time, I personally believe that it's both BU's and Core's fault that we arrived at this point. Both parties exhibited poor, childish behaviour without any sense for the bigger picture. It's a shame that grown men cannot find a suitable compromise so all parties involved are satisfied.
Pointing fingers is no longer a viable option. Act now or bitcoin will slowly fade into obscurity and be replaced as the leading crypto currency. (I do not hold any stakes in other crypto currencies, this is just a logical assessment of the situation as there clearly still is demand for a virtual currency)

How have things changed recently? The latest batch of S9s was shipped by beginning of this month, and was available to the public as per usual.
On the other hand, there was a time when one couldn't simply buy ASIC miners from companies like BitFury. So I think it's a bit hypocritical to blame Bitmain for having the option to not sell to anybody (which technically every company has), while other ASIC manufacturers actually did refuse to do so.
Makes no sense to me. And Jihan's tweets aren't any more toxic than what I've read from some Core supporters / developers. Also, how is Antpool an issue, but BitFury's pool isn't? Again with the hypocrisy.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:51:38
Nobody outside of this sub took notice of Jihan's tweet, while everyone trading at a major exchange noticed the hysteria spread by the announcement. Just visit a neutral bitcoin related subreddit for reference if you do not believe me.
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:09:43
I sold at $1260, and I'm merely waiting for an opportune moment to buy back in. If I did so right now, I would have gained several bitcoins by this endeavour. But as I've already mentioned, I don't think this is the end of the road just yet.
You're more than welcome to just hold and never multiply the amount of bitcoins you have, it's your decision. But please don't act as if "hodling" was the holy grail of investing - because that's a pretty infantile POV.
Currencies and stocks go up AND down, you know? The same applies to bitcoin. It was pretty obvious a crash was overdue when the fees reached 2$ per transaction with no compromise in sight. But hey, you can keep your blindfolds on if you prefer to - I won't force you to see the light.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:02:03
Try the bitcoinmarkets subreddit. They discuss price changes objectively - and to them, the reason for the crash clearly lied in the hysteria spread by the signing exchanges. Nobody even mentioned Jihan's tweet in that context.

lmao dude you're fucking retarded
bitmain is the only asic provider that sells to anybody on this planet. the only one. and you want to exclude their hardware? how's that going to further decentralization? do you even think?
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:25:13
Changing the PoW is a fundamental contradiction to Satoshi's whitepaper. While not impossible, it would definitely define a new altcoin. Core would become the altcoin by definition, no questions there.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:23:03
As far as I know, they currently have no S9s in stock. They are taking orders for the next batch, which will be shipped by the end of this month. FYI, the same applies to their cloud mining service Hashnest - they have never played favorites. When they're out, they're out.
You can think of Jihan what you want, and I agree that some of his tweets are immature. But he runs his business in a very honorable and fair way. When ASIC miners were getting popular, so many people got scammed. And the ones that were actually being produced were often only sold privately. But not Bitmain: They always delivered to the public, and they always treated their customers fairly. He deserves credit for that at least.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:09:49
That's what I thought - you're just trying to be mean and discredit me based on what you think I am. But you have no facts to back up any of your claims, because you know Bitmain has always sold their hardware to the public with no exception. Which is something that cannot be said about other ASIC manufacturers, like BitFury, for instance.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:52:59
Adam Back is the CEO of blockstream, and some of the things he said were just as toxic as what Jihan's saying. The hypocrisy never ends..
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:55:41
So you want to punish Bitmain for producing the best ASIC miners? Am I understanding this correctly?
I could understand your concerns if Bitmain closed its doors, kept all their hardware for themselves and actively tried hijacking the blockchain. But they don't, and they don't. Everything Bitmain did up to this point was fair and square: Selling hardware to everyone that wants a piece, and voting according to the right put in place by Satoshi.
I don't understand why they are being painted as the bad guys. Bitmain is a good company.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:15:19
I think there are good arguments for both BU and Core pushing centralization in their very own way. Speculating what Satoshi might think about the current situation is just ridiculous. If there really was a statement from him, great, but memes like these belong in the trash.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:22:03
Exactly, this is the relevant chart. Blockstream might change how proposals are realized in the future, but as of now PoW is still the relevant factor. And while support for SegWit has been stagnating at around 25-26% for months, BU is gaining support on a daily basis, currently being at around 34%.
OP is the one spreading FUD here.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:21:33
As I've said, those three bulletins are all facts. Ask any Hashnest customer and they will confirm it. They could sell all of their hardware to Hashnest customers that exclusively mine for Antpool, or keep it to themselves, yet they choose to offer it to the global public first. Every. Time. S3s through S9s. No exceptions.
As to why he's trying to decentralize Bitcoin: Maybe because his life and the life of his company is built on the success of Bitcoin, and Bitcoin can only profit from decentralization? Is that really so hard to comprehend?
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:33:49
I beg to differ. It is time to act like adults and settle on a compromise that everyone would benefit from.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:19:09
You do realize that this could have been posted in either sub, and both parties would feel like the video talks about techniques of the other side, right?
How is this helping the scaling debate again? Pointing fingers and dismissing any sort of compromise got us into this mess in the first place.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:21:04
PoW change is a fundamental contradiction to Satoshi's whitepaper. One could argue that it alters the currency too much, and could cause financial damages to people already invested.
Regardless, I don't think it's a smart move to piss off SegWit's biggest supporter even further. luke-jr's thread in the bitcointalk forum was just too much, the guy's insane. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:49:13
They are selling mining hardware to anybody that's willing to buy it. Stop spreading lies. I'm an individual with no ties to the Chinese or Bitmain, and have bought several of their products without any issues.
In fact, ask any miner with some serious hashing power (not USB stick heroes) what kind of hardware they are running. Chances are Bitmain products are among them - because they are the most efficient machines and also available to the public.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:39:47
No - I can only speculate who initiated that statement. But it was praised as some sort of salvation message in this sub, while it effectively crashed the price by causing hysteria and a dramatic response from holders. But now that Jihan is speaking up, he better be careful not to cause hysteria!! Because that's everybody's  priority here!! That's the hypocrisy that bothers me.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:23:32
Don't worry Samson, the miners know exactly what's going on, and they can see through the verbal diarrhea you call tweets. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:15:34
They are sold out. So?! ASIC miners are produced in batches - just ask any business insider. I already mentioned that the latest batch was shipped out beginning of this month. It will take them a couple of weeks to restock. It's always been like this. Nothing has changed.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:17:54
Yes, you got me. Jihan is my lover and he regularly sodomizes me in exchange for mining hardware. He is also a crazy dictator that single handedly controls over 50% of all global hashing power. All these years Bitmain has just acted like a friendly, honorable company so they could strike now and finally destroy the currency that they have built their lives on. But alas, you foiled his masterplan - kudos to you, you're so smart!!
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:06:37
Yes, I'm a paid shill, a sock-puppet with googly-eyes glued to my clothy head. Haha, very funny. How does this invalidate my statement again? Do you have any arguments that would prove that Bitmain does not sell their miners to the public?
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:15:11
Why not increase the blocksize to 2MB as an emergency fix for the ridiculous transaction fees? That at least buys us some time for more discussions..
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:37:15
As I've already mentioned twice, all three of those are undeniable facts. Just because you want me to be wrong doesn't make it so. Every one of these bulletins is 100% true. The actions I have described can be confirmed by everyone that's paid attention to Bitmain as a company in the past and present. I'm sorry if this shatters your view of the "evil Chinese miners", but this is just how it is.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:50:19
(1) Running ASIC miners is always a risk, nobody can guarantee ROI on mining, while Bitmain gets guaranteed profit on every sale they make
(2) Diversifying income streams is important. Also keep in mind that running miners takes up a lot of space
(3) Bitmain believes in decentralization, which is why EVERY TIME a new unit is introduced, it is first being sold to the public, and not to customers of their cloud mining service Hashnest
These are all facts.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:50:01
Activation through signalling by miners? Very slim. The mining pool support by proposal is currently 33.5% vs 26.9% - BU vs SegWit. But BU is gaining support by miners while SegWit has been stagnating at around 26% for the past couple of weeks. So it seems like neither proposal is going to be activated conventionally anytime soon. That's why a compromise is crucial at this point. We need an emergency fix that all miners would immediately agree on.
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:00:32

Adam Back's twitter and bitcointalk accounts? Do you even know that Satoshi approached Back in 2009, but was ridiculed by him? It wasn't until a couple of years later, when Bitcoin was already successful, when Back decided to join in. He lacks vision and is only after the money.

@_date: 2017-03-18 02:59:34
You do not seem to understand what a compromise is. And no, SegWit is not essentially the same. While I do not wish to defend anybody's side here, SegWit would introduce off-chain scaling which many miners are heavily opposed to.
At this point, all parties involved have to ask themselves: Do we really want bitcoin to fail because we will not accept anything else than what our preferred development team is offering? Or can we start acting like adults and find an agreement that suits everyone's needs? This constant bickering isn't helping anybody.
Unfortunately, it seems that too many people involved in bitcoin lack real life business experience. Things like these happen in the economic world on a daily basis: Conflicts of interest will always arise, but what differentiates successful people from the ones that fail is willingness and capability to compromise. You will not always get what you want - and whether you actually have the better solution or not is irrelevant. Politics, human inertia, distorted views of reality, personal agendas, pride, pack behaviour - these are all hurdles entirely disconnected from the technical discussion. Let's assume SegWit is the holy grail of scaling solutions for a second: So what? How does that help anybody in the situation right now? SegWit isn't going to be activated at this point in time for reasons I have already mentioned. So why not compromise for now, keep the currency alive and use the bought time to further convince bitcoin peers? That's the smart move right now.
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:59:10
Exactly! It blows my mind how people are oblivious to this fact.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:13:56
I would usually quote Nicholas Hoult in Mad Max in these kind of situations: *"I live, I die, I live again."*
But this time is different. Bitcoin has serious competition now, and the differences between Blockstream and the BU supporters seem insurmountable. Neither side is willing to compromise, and the statement released by exchanges has just accelerated the deterioration of trust in bitcoin as a currency, especially with people that do not follow the technical debate at all. A very sad week.

I don't think the current price movement is your regular fluctuation. Something's in the air. I don't know whether it's the rising fees, failure of Chinese exchanges to provide proof of solvency, or frustration among big holders about the stagnation of development. I can just speculate, but I'd be careful right now, we've reached a boiling point in the scaling debate and while I always advocated holding, the recent development in the last few months made me somewhat uncertain of that paradigm. I don't want to tell anybody what to do, you're all adults, but personally, I have sold off some my coins a couple of days ago, as there's just too much to lose at this point. I always try to remember that bitcoins are just 1s and 0s with no intrinsic value. All of this could be over in a matter of weeks, and I wanted to see some of the profits I've gained over the past few years safe and sound in my bank account.

Following exchanges have NOT signed the statement: Coinbase, Gemini, BTC-e, CEX, itBit, LocalBitcoins, OKCoin, Wall of Coins, Paxful.
Also, the CEOs of Kraken and Shapeshift have addressed the public since the statement was released, claiming it was altered AFTER they signed it, saying "we don't agree with everything represented there."
Erik Voorhees of Shapeshift also went one step further, saying that they will "use the BTC/Bitcoin name for whichever chain unambiguously "won" over time." To me, it seems like the majority chain will be guaranteed the Bitcoin name, and will be represented by all exchanges. Which makes sense, considering that exchanges probably have no political agenda in this, only fiduciary duty to stakeholders and investors.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:07:21
What about the huge farms in Iceland? What about individual miners all over the world running smaller operations? Not every miner supporting BU is Chinese, you know? But hey, I guess calling me names is easier than conceding to the fact that you're wrong. Maybe I should just stop discussing this issue until support for BU has reached 70% - by then, these arguments will be futile as even the dimmest of dimwits won't claim that 70% of hashing power is situated in China.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:21:03
Considering that we dropped 150$ today, I'm quite happy with my decision. I would buy back if I felt more confident, but seeing as the two opposing parties will not come to a compromise anytime soon, I will refrain from doing so. You are more than welcome to hodl all the way if you prefer so yourself - but please don't act as if you know what's best for everybody. If I bought back now, I would gain several bitcoins just from selling prior to the crash, so obviously I must have done something right..

Option 3: Keep the current protocol and just adjust the blocksize to 2MB. No SegWit, no bigger BU blocks that are flexible in size. Just plain ol' 2MB blocks. That's a compromise that alleviates a problem EVERYONE can recognize. Neither "camp" gets what they want, but the bitcoin community profits as a whole.
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:55:25
While most of these points are somewhat speculative, I believe the last one to be a fact:


This is going to happen regardless of expressed support for other clients or any signed statements that might exist from exchanges. Whichever chain ends up "winning" over time will be known as bitcoin in the future. It is very unlikely that the minority chain will even survive as a relevant cryptocurrency.
