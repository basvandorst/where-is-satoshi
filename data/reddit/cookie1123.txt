coinbase // circle 
had trouble before with coinbase, not just the waiting..
used circle since the start NO issues.. now circle is a mess, system errors recently,
and coinbase is no release my coins right away after the short confirms ..








closed my circle accounts yesterday, IF you are able to buy coins it is likely then your account gets 'froze' for 3-5 'business days' (which was weeks for me) and you CANNOT move coin out of their wallet.
odd flop of services.. any relevance ? Just find it interesting some will have issues with one, or no problem, or be hit with a problem over the last x amount of months
