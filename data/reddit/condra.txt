Personally I think the future for Bitcoin might look like this:
1 = Remittance
2 = Adult Industry including porn/dating/toys/cams
3 = Black Market
4 = Gambling
5 = International Outsourcing (ala Fiverr/elance)
6 = Tips for online Entertainment/Music/Journalism/tuts/vlogs
7= "Pay As You Go" online services
8 = Online shopping/jewellery/gadgets etc
9 = "Pay As You Go" OFFLINE services
10 = Charity &amp; Fundraising
"Every day" offline stuff like coffee and taxis .. way down the list

I want bigger blocks, just none of this IP address stuff  :/
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:14:57
I don't care what happens as long as this Blacklist/IP address stuff stays off the table

Tradebit really ought to jump on this idea. It even has the BIT in the name :)

That voice though

I completely agree. The terminology is fucked. As is the insistence on giving a new name to every decimal place, rather than every 2 decimal places. 
Also, more generally, Bitcoin education focusses too much on blockchain technology, rather than the benefits to the end user. To use Bitcoin, nobody should need to know, or care about Blockchain, Cryptography, Mining, etc.
Reminds me of the old Irish Financial Regulator advert

Bitcoin needs a major player like Ebay or Amazon to get behind it.

Very slow here today. Waiting an hour for BTC withdrawal from Kraken. Not impressed  &gt; :( 
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:07:34
Just proves how far off mainstream use BTC still is.

People really shouldn't use electronic communication for important, nuanced things. Everyone is way nicer in person. This is getting out of hand.

Kraken works very well when you don't need to make an urgent transaction  :/ 
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:23:41
Kraken is down
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:14:00
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:47:15
OMG How could we not have guessed what was about to happen?! :)
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:46:59
I'm out of Kraken ASAP. Days like today is when you NEED the site working 100%.

@_date: 2015-11-03 13:52:22
Kraken is down today :( WTFFFF

What about this MMM thing? Could it have anything to do with the price drop? Like. The story gets exposed in China and people sell like crazy?
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:23:45
Me too. Stupid fooking fancy camera lens I've used like twice. Ugh.
@_date: 2015-11-03 13:34:06
HOLY £*$%&amp;. This changes the game.

@_date: 2015-11-05 16:21:52
Why is nobody talking about  M M M  ? ? ? 
@_date: 2015-11-03 13:36:01
Ugh I'm waiting for this fooking SEPA transfer to buy more. Wanna get in before 400. Hell, I wanna get in before 1k
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:01:36
But they are asleep. :)
