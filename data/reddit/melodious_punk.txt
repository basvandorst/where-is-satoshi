My phone broke January 5th and I didn't have 2fa for 10 days. It was glorious.

It all depends on whether BTC can fulfill the M2 money supply. If BTC only replaces the use of paper currencies(M1) it still has 14x to go.

That's the issue. A useful currency is one you use for essential goods and services. If you can't buy food and shelter with something it's a commodity, not a currency.

Holding is the first step. Selling goods and services for bitcoin is the next step. Buying goods and services in BTC is the next step. Then one day you wake up and satoshis are on the menu at McDonald's

amen. the taxable events took all of the thrill out of crypto markets for me but it has probably saved me some value by putting some friction on bad trades.

Yeah, but no CA, UK, Nigeria, etc.?

Only United States showed up for the region data on that query.

Th region data is even more illuminating. South Africa, Australia, Slovenia, and Canada are much higher than the United States.
