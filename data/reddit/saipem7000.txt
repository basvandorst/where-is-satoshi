What are you talking about? I was reporting the stats and they were correct. Only a fraction of the total shorts has been liquidated. It's still 57/43 shorts/longs.
Also, I have no position atm.

Caps for visibility:
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN ALREADY WHY AN ETF WOULD ATTRACT NEW INVESTORS, JESUS CHRIST?!
1. Institutional investors can already buy and hold physical BTC through Coinbase.
2.  Institutional investors can already trade BTC futures if they don't want the risk associated with custody.
An ETF does not offer any advantage over those two options. All institutional investors who want to invest in crypto can do so RIGHT NOW.

A significant volume of shorts was already liquidated yesterday and this morning ($30m+) which was probably the main reason for this rise. Most of the shorts now are not at high risk of being liquidated.

Are you seriously pulling out the unfounded FUD from months ago? Lol.

Facepalm. Another McDonald's cashier has entered the crypto gambling market.

How did you come up with this BS? Of course they can.
Petróleos de Venezuela has several refineries.

Yes, 


The OTC price inevitably tracks the price on the major UNREGULATED exchanges (otherwise there would be arbitrage opportunities for the issuer of the ETF). Hence, the OTC price is equally subject to market manipulation due to illegal trading activities on unregulated exchanges.
Thus, the Van Eck ETF doesn't alleviate the SEC's concerns whatsoever.

Of course it does! The main reason for the rejection, i.e. the risk of market manipulation due to unregulated exchanges applies to the Van Eck ETF as well.
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:20:57
Lol. That is the epitome of fake news.
@_date: 2018-07-27 05:43:57
This. It would be highly inconsistent by the SEC if the Van Eck ETF was approved given that the main reason for the rejection of the Wink ETF was the risk of market manipulation which also applies to the Van Eck ETF.

Why do such articles always neglect cryptocurrencies that cannot be mined?
