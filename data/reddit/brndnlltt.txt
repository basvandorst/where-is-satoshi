Mine isn't loose fwiw
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:10:39
I've got mine in cold storage too, but I can't help but wonder what would happen to the value of bitcoin if Coinbase actually went under
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:25:37
Did you lose the .01?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:16:11
Lol sad that this is currently true

Anyone noticed the huge discrepancy between coinbase and Gemini exchange prices? Both are seemingly online and off by about $1k USD in value at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:02:34
lol wasn't it above 19k for less than a minute?

Well if you think about it....You can't spell STEAL without TESLA

lol I've had so many people tell me "oh it's a bubble it's gonna tank any day now" 
Yeah people said that at $1, $100, $1000, $5000, $9000 etc

He's saying you're putting all your eggs in one basket by entirely relying on BTC to thrive. While it's good to be optimistic, you also gotta be aware the risk

What's with the 11.6 line you drew in the sand
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:00:00
It reads like an AI combed posts from this sub and posted generically
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:27:38
I mean it's still around 10k, and to claim a 1.5k swing on btc as proof of your claim is arrogant IMO

So you're doing the labor for free?
