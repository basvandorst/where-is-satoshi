Don't make it sound like you need or should use to use " Digital Payment Processor Service ". This is Bitcoin, not fiat and we've all learnt of the risks of compromising our sovereignty for laziness.   
Check out [btcpayserver.org]( where you become a "Digital Payment Processor Service" and directly receive bitcoin without KYC, censorship, fees and potentially funding bad actors.  
Here's a full guide: [

Comparing the ratio of funding to features, we're not behind at all. :)  We're not competitors anyways, just similar goals.

True, but at this point you should be fair and complain about all the other evil companies and their giant dev ecosystems too. golang, dart and angular are google creations for example and you have most likely used something using them.

Just because you do not have the private keys of your customers it does not mean you are decentralized.  You ARE a centralized service, and that's fine. Just don't lie about it.
On another note, your checkout UI is practically a clone of either BTCPay or Bitpay which leads me to the question: Did you fork btcpay? :)
