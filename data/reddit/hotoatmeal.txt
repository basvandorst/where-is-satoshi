I think the utility comes from being able to throw away information you control in such a way that you're guaranteed to be able to get it back, but not without waiting a given length of time. If you retain the information, then you have not guaranteed to yourself that even you will not be able to unlock it before the time has elapsed.
As for when that's useful as a practical tool (other than the examples the author gives), I'm not sure. I'll have to dream up other uses of it... a hammer in search of nails.


Yes, it would. The duration is set by estimating how fast the fastest sha256 asic is, and creating a chain of hashes that's at least as slow to compute as the intended timeframe. If a faster asic is created during the timelock, then the timelock could be unlocked sooner than it was set for.
The end of the paper describes a strategy for "laying down the tracks before the train gets there" which allows the person creating the timelock to tune the difficulty with each new segment of "track".
The part that seems of dubious utility to me is that the timelock creator only has a linear advantage over an adversary trying to unlock it sooner than intended. If there is a way to extend this strategy to make the advantage quadratic or better, then I think it would be much more useful.

No. With cash it's guaranteed to go down in value... You just don't notice it as much because all of your transactions are denominated in it.
Bitcoin is still in its inflationary stage, so it currently suffers from this (in addition to the volatility), but eventually that will subside.

the part that's still not clear is how the future date is determined to have happened _trustlessly_.
suppose we both agree to set up a transaction that happens with some condition on or after January 1st 2015... how do guarantee *now* that *later* there will be no disagreement on exactly when that time/date happened once that date comes to pass? For example, we could agree to trust time.nist.gov for the time/date stamp, but that still places trust in a centralized third party. How would you guarantee that such a time source provides accurate, precise, and not-tampered-with, data without having to place trust in a third party (who could possibly be bribed to influence their data in my/your favor)?

Is it possible to construct these kinds of cryptographic challenges such that bots cannot double spend the transaction?
If transactions can refer to data in others, I bet it could be something like "transaction is valid if you give me a transaction id in a block at least N blocks ago that contains op_return data that when hashed matches the hash of some other different data, *and* is payable to the same address as the other txn". Then person that submits the first legit transaction pair of this kind gets an N block advantage, making the double spend more difficult to pull off.

@_date: 2015-01-08 00:22:39
The issue is not the purchasing power of the tokens after a year... the lender gives out 100 tokens and expects back 110 tokens, which is impossible to fulfill. The lendees cannot pay him back the full amount plus interest, he will foreclose on someone. He won't accept fewer tokens even though they're worth more (given that the economy grew), because his agreement was to get back 11 tokens each after the year.... He wins, and someone always loses.

I suppose... but that only works if you know who owns the private keys for the address you sent the coins to, and only if that person is in the jurisdiction that your courts are willing to preside over.
I don't really have a good philosophy on property either, but one thing that I think is fundamental to ownership is the ability to control something.


What about money that you find on the ground... finders keepers? Or does it belong to the person that lost it? Does it depend on how much was lost?

Ownership is different now that we have an immutable public ledger. There's no possible way you can force someone to sign a transaction sending the coins back to an address you control, unlike in traditional banking. Once you send bitcoin to an address that you don't control, it's not "yours" anymore. This isn't a value judgement, but rather a statement of how things are.
A couple of useful thought experiments:
  * What does it mean to you to "own" bitcoin?
  * When is it "yours" and when is it someone else's?
  * What if you accidentally sent those bitcoin to 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE, who owns it then?
You'll find that ownership in the crypto space depends on keeping private keys secret.
@_date: 2015-08-14 19:18:03
Exactly. Ownership in bitcoin depends on keeping secrets that no one else knows. If you are not the only one who knows the private keys, then you don't "own" the bitcoin.

You (intentionally?) missed the next word I used in the quoted sentence: "seems".


Unless ChangeTip have specifically said in their TOS that they will not sell your information, it's still fair game, even retroactively. That's not something I'm comfortable with, so I don't use ChangeTip. Merely the fact that they *could*, and that doing so would be very lucrative is enough to rationally conclude that they probably will.
You're quick to discredit people with this viewpoint by calling them "rabble rousers"... but it's a legitimate concern.  Showing that it's not possible to prove that they'll become a personal information selling business isn't comforting (even though your proof is valid).
Do you have a vested interest in ChangeTip succeeding? I don't have one in it failing... I'm just not convinced ChangeTip isn't an information selling business.

I wish OP_HODL was easier to use. Keeping the private key feels kinda dishonest to me, however making that explicit with a time lock would be much better.

Imagine you've got a two bit key. That can be: 00, 01, 10, or 11. Any errors in that cannot be detected, nor corrected.
Now suppose we add a third bit that tells us the "parity" of the other two. Parity here means "are they the same". With that encoding, we have these valid keys:
001, 010, 100, and 111
(corresponding to: 00, 01, 10, and 11 respectively)
and these invalid keys:
000, 011, 101, and 110
Now the encoding can detect 1 bit being flipped, but it cannot correct any.
There are ways to extend this to detect a fixed number of flips / transpositions / omissions / etc, and correct a fixed number of them too, all at the expense of making the encoded sorting longer. This is all a part of Information Coding Theory, and you can read more about it here:

build the exact tagged version of the bootloader from source, hash it, then build a firmware that displays a message you created on the spot (so it can’t be guessed by the bootloader), upload that, read the features object which contains the bootloader hash, compare that with what you built earlier. for extra security, pad your binary with random data, and add a new fsm message to hash the firmware you uploaded too (use an HMAC, with host-provided salt to be sure the bootloader can’t fool you).

Completely safe.

Now you've got even more attack surface area:
* Have to trust that the QR code reader isn't malicious.
* Have to trust that there isn't any malware watching your clipboard.
Hardware wallets solve most of these issues by doing signing on the device... the private keys never leave it.

I'm arguing that your second point is invalid... it's not that I've "forgotten" it.
If there's no coin, there's no way to secure the ledger in a way that's not a centralized authority. Banks have no problem with the centralized authority model, and there are plenty of solutions which are more efficient at solving the problems that a blockchain with such centralized authority solves.... using a blockchain doesn't add anything for their use cases, and in fact it would make them less efficient.

the real trezor website does have a method to do “dry run” recovery on your device. make sure you’re entering the words that the device asks for, not what the ui asks for, since doing the latter could compromise your seed. if it all works out correctly, your device will tell you whether the seed is valid &amp; whether it is the same as the one on the device.

Depends on whether the fees are cheaper than fractional reserve inflation. Actually, you're right... Most people wont be able to see that distinction, and will go with the one that gives them tokens (even if by devaluing the tokens they already have).

Using standard multisig, you could set up a 2of3 with your friends, and keep all three keys yourself, giving out two of them to friends. Another way is to do 2of4, where you hold 2 keys, and your friends each hold the other two.
Or if you really wanted to, you could set up a p2sh script that can be spent by 1 or 2of3. It’ll be tough finding a wallet that will help you do that though, since it’s not a standard multisig setup.

@_date: 2019-05-15 13:06:25
That it takes 19 million years to try every combination of the known-to-the-attackers words makes trezor’s recovery method safe. The device asks you for them in a random order every time you recover, so the attacker has no way of knowing what the real order is. If you’re ultra paranoid, use the “advanced recovery” method, which has you do everything on the device.

Another way to do the first one would be to generate a bip39 mnemonic, then derive xpubs at three hardened spots in the tree, then export xprivs for two of them (to give to your friends). Set up a standard 2of3 multisig with these xpubs. Then you have one master backup, with your friends able to spend but only if they cooperate.
