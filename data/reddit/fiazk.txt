Agreed, Kraken is no thief. I had 2 very similar experiences but I got my money back either way. 
The 1st one was 10k USD, these were never credited to my kraken account due to an issue they had with its intermediary payward (can't remember if that's the correct name) and the money was returned to my bank account after more than  2 months of email exchanges.
The 2nd one was 9k EUR, my bank didn't include the reference # on the deposit description and it took around 1 month to get it credited into my kraken account since kraken was not able to identify this tx as mine

"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."
This issue could be tackle with a different approach. The same way there is a very active USD black market in Venezuela, we could support the country's BTC adoption, so people can have a viable alternative to the super devalued Bfs. Some ideas that I can suggest are: 
- Facilitate to employers BTC payments to their employees
- Incentivize employers to receive BTC
- Facilitate BTC purchase to the people
- Spread the word about best BTC mobile wallets, etc.
The people in Venezuela are the ones who should lead this movement, and I believe this approach is more diverse and has a higher chance of success than just paying someone to fight with law something that is inmune to it

1 BTC would be more like 629 USD using the blackmarket dollar price. Has anyone tried it yet?
