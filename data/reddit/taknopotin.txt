I sure can. Can you?
Or, if you prefer:
126%+ capacity


privacy, as well as meet the requirements of health and hygiene, with due regard being given to
climatic conditions and especially to floor space, cubic air space, lighting, heating and ventilation?
In legislation these are principles guiding the treatment of inmates. In practice overcrowding is an
acute and chronic problem in Greek prisons. Although new prisons have been built and new wings
added, conditions of detention have deteriorated so much that both the European Court of Human
Rights and the CPT declare that conditions of custody are incompatible with human dignity. Since many
cells of 9,5 m2
are occupied by four or five people, privacy is undoubtedly violated. Under these
circumstances, not even the basic requirements of health and hygiene can be met: some prisons are
over-run by cockroaches, the mattresses are filthy and the cells are often dirty. Prisoners themselves
are by law responsible for their personal hygiene and the condition of the cells they live in.

And the whole reason people want to get Euros out is because Euros are STABLE.  If they can get those out of the bank and hold onto them, they have an international currency that holds value.  BTC has had ranges from 240-260 in the past few days, and who knows where it will go from there.  The rush for cash isn't "I think the gov will take my money" it's that most of them spend CASH as opposed to digital version, and that they are a little afraid of their Euros being force converted to a new currency if the government leaves the Euro.  BTC doesn't offer any advantage of them getting and keeping Euros, and in fact offers a lot of drawbacks since there are few to no places to spend it in Greece and it requires more infrastructure than cash.
TL;DR: I wish would get off the "greece will save us"/"we'll save greece" train.

I'd go one step further and declare malarkey on a bank requesting a W2 or even a photo ID to reactivate a prior activated card.  Usually THEY call you, and all you have to do is say "yes, those are my charges" and away you go. In the off chance they don't, calling the number on the back of your card will reactivate it.  At my bank, going to ANY ATM, and inserting the card + proper PIN will reactivate the card for a cash withdrawal up to $200 even if the account was blocked for fraud detection.
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:41:07
Don't even have to ask really.  Fraudulent charges cannot be solely responsible for overdraft fees as of ~2010.  It was part of the whole structuring of charges reform.   If you tell your bank "The only reason I was overdrafted is the fraudulent charge" they will reverse it.  Assuming this is true.  I do see 2 OD charges though...

We can.  Services like mint do exactly this. And have been for.... 5+years?   **What you're describing is the envelope method if budgeting.   That has been around for many decades, longer than I've been alive.   Nothing you've mentioned is new; and arguably is worse than the old solutions because you have no recourse.   Example: you nlocktime your slush money to save it.   You get in an accident = you're fucked because you can't get your money now.      Essentially what you're saying is you can't be trusted to handle money, so you want to lose the ability to handle it.    Everything else is something "legacy" banking does and has done for decades.  And the money in your bank acct is always spent the way you say it should be. It's your money after all.

The facts say otherwise.  From the European Prison Observatory:


excluding pre-trial detainees): 7.971 – 63,89%
So anywhere from ~36% are pre-trial prisoners.  Greek prison system is a lot different that the US.  When you get arrested, you get sent to the regional prison and that is where you are held.  Read the prison observatory report, you'll see that doing this is just plain stupid.  And, it's not a legal framework on digital currencies, it's unlicensed money transmission, which easily falls under the greek laws for Money laundering and money transmisson as outlined here:

I'm reality, it wouldn't take this. You don't actually have to fill up all the slots/block or all the blocks. It creates a positive I feedback that would cascade on itself. I saw an interesting article on it the other day, but I don't remember if I found it here or buttcoin or elsewhere, so I may not be able to find it again. 
Essentially, if you start congesting the network crazy amounts, like the 1 hr test did, you get huge delays downstream.  This compounds the more you do it, more than directly proportional to your actions, at least partially because others will also be trying to do it, but also because if you were able to fill mempool, transactions would start getting completely lost or never propagate to the network.
This delay, and in some cases transactions-blindness would hinder legitimate uses of bitcoin enough that people who transact in it would suffer greatly. This leads to a loss of faith in the protocol/network, resulting in people fleeing. People fleeing causes a loss of value, which makes your attack even easier. 
Edit: I remember the article specifically mentioning mempool, and the paraphrase of "can't even exchange my money for useful money now" ( referring to trying to sell bitcoin for USD or other money being blocked by transactions being lost or slowed beyond what anyone reasonably could accomadate)
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:20:27
What hardware upgrading would solve this problem?
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:47:20
I don't think fee markets would effectively solve that problem.  It would take way too long to stabilize on a fee, and anyone trying to shut down the network (It could just be anyone with a few thousand dollars to throw away, I refuse to say banks/govt whatever would do it because they simply don't care about bit coin) could do it effectively by willingly putting in money in transaction fees.  The more transactions that get backed up, the more it compounds and the longer it takes to clear the backlog.  Look at this one hour test for a clear example: one hour of a few people doing transactions backed up the network for 8 HOURS.  Assuming proportional changes at current costs, they would only need to flood the network for probably 4 hours at the cost of [2.7tps x 60s x 10 = 1620 number of transactions available per block x 6 = 9720 transaction per hour on average.  x .0002 avg fee on the high end like the redditor above = about 7.75 BTC to fill up 4 hours of transactions.]
  That is just their contributions, not the normal spending to go with it.  And doesn't account for people re-attempting their transaction when they see it doesn't go through, etc.  7.75BTC is about 1850 bucks.  That's all it would take per day to shut down the whole transaction network at current block size, and then we run into problems with the NON-confirmed transactions filling the mempool, and then those go on compound problems even further.
Edit: I realized I did a lot more math than I needed to do, and VASTLY over-rated the amount it would cost to spamDOS the network.
0.0001bit coin, the min fee right now per KB* 1000 the MAX number of KB per block * 144 the average number of blocks per day = 1.44 BTC in transaction fees to fill every block with just your transactions.  About 350 bucks

Ah, see that's what I was talking about right there!  I knew there must be a somewhat easy way to roughly figure out how much impact 4 hours of downtime/reversal would have.
Yeah, the average is skewed because the US is a very productive nation.   However, with only 1 significant figure, 40B and 35B are the same...  I'd be hard pressed to say that other nations would be as impacted as the US since we have both a very large economy and a fairly large population.  
I'd also say that neither of us are anywhere near accurate though.  The loss of faith in companies and from companies would be astronomical.  If even 10 minutes of the economy was affected, we'd probably see ripples in the neighborhood of billions lost, not the least of which because consumers would be less likely to spend money and companies would be less likely to accept money because they expect the exchange of goods/cash to go smoothly.  Any interruption of the smooth exchange would have massive effects.
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:18:16
Your math seems way off:
 126VEF is about 20USD on the official market.  It's about .25cents at the blackmarket rate.  If you're buying a BTC for that, you're coming out WAY ahead.
Your logic is also faulty:
The hyperinflation affects price of goods, so exchanging BTC to VEF still subjects to the same change that VEF has, and your also subjecting yourself to the steady decline BTC has had for the past year+. 
Again, how are you spending bits? Everyone wants USD.  If you're converting to USD from bits, your subjecting yourself to the devaluation of the VEF, the lower BTC rate as of late, AND the increased cost of the USD, so you're essentially taking 3 conversion fee costs.
Now, let's assume you bought USD on the blackmarket 6 months ago instead of buying BTC: 
The blackmarket exchange in January was about 175:1 VEF:USD.
You said earlier you made ~200USD/month now.
So, you could have bought 200USD then (or more, since I assume you get paid in VEF and the official exchange of VEF:USD and the blackmarket VEF:USD were much higher)
That ~200USD is now worth ~90000VEF, originally worth 30000.  More than doubled your money in VEF.  (Which is not reflective of buying power since hyperinflation has raised price of goods)
Now, let's say you bought 1 BTC in January (I'm being generous and letting you buy &gt;1month salary in this case)  I saw on bitcoinwisdom average price was ~300USD.
300USD then -&gt; ~256 today.  That's a 16% nominal loss already.
   256 x 450(current BM VEF/USD) = 115200.
200/300 = ~.67 (Your ratio of original input USD purchase/BTC purchase)  
x 450 (current VEF:USD BM) = 77184
Total VEF "earned" difference:
90000(if USD held) - 77184 (if BTC held)= ~13000
Or, about 29USD.  About 6 weeks earnings lost in holding, not counting the transfer fees (.02USD/200USD = .01% of your monthly income PER transfer) And whatever conversion fees you may be paying to an exchange.

Coinbase sells a good at market rate, their business shouldn't be hurt by that in any case.  And use of the bit-coin network is not constrained.  They can literally say they want to use every bit of it.
Being decentralized means you lose a lot of protections, and you don't get to decide how someone uses your product.  WU is not decentralized, they decide how you use their product, and when you must STOP using their product.  Using it after they've told you not to will face legal repercussions, and attacking a company directly would also face legal repercussions (like if someone attacked Coinbase).  
Using a protocol is not something that you can sue someone for, even if it's in a way that people don't like.

It's all relative.  Bit-coin went ~265% against the VEF and USD went 300% against VEF. Bit-coin went ~16% down YTD vs USD.  Comparisons are useful yo. I have no idea what you were attempting to say with your post though since it seems clear to me that that distinction was in the relative gains and losses.
VEF decreased more vs the dollar than bit-coin.  And since items in Venezuela are priced in VEF, it makes more sense to use the higher conversion rate currency.

If the global economy reversed for 250 minutes, I wonder what the impact would be.  I imagine a good place to start would be the cost to shut down the US government for a few days.  The 2013 shutdown cost the economy 24B in 16 days.  Or 2.5B/day.  So, ~ 600M lost to the economy in 4 hours.  Now, the US Gov employs ~4,185,000 including military personnel.   The population of the US is ~320M.  That means that if the entire US could not spend money for 4 hours or it got reversed), and assuming corporations fall under this number to make the averages a little more consistent: ~40B dollars would be lost to the economy.  In four hours.  That's a lot of latte purchases.
I'd have a really hard time extrapolating this to the global scale, but I imagine there's an average flow of money number floating around somewhere for global stats.

So you're saying you didn't link the two, but you provide escrow and listing.  The listing requires both users to register on your webpage, and they meet, but the specific details of users seems to be hidden behind a wall that only you can see.
Yeah... you are matchmaking, you should be liable for this.
BTW, your guide is full of typos and grammar mistakes in addition to the take-home message being: All of the payment methods are reversible and will screw the seller AND all of the payment methods are preferred methods of cashing out stolen CC numbers.

I sort of like this view, but I can't wrap my head around why Visa wouldn't just use an internal ledger like they do now? Or why a blockchain would help them?

I only used VEF as the constant for comparison.  Regardless, holding USD would have been more profitable than holding BTC by 16%. 
You still haven't mentioned how you spend USD. Conversion fe
e alone could cost you another several % nominal "earnings". And I guarantee the market for BTC in Venezuela is so shallow that attempting to "cash out" would single handedly crash the local price if you hold more than 5 BTC, whereas the USD black market is thriving.  Really, I don't see any real benefit to holding BTC over USD except ideology.  If that's the case, so be it.

Buying bit-coin specifically for the purpose of selling it to another individual means you require an MSB license.  The low bar for transfer amounts is only 200-300USD in most states.
It doesn't help if you know that the intended use of your product is also illegal, that will fall under AML statutes as well.
Edit: On looking at the Federal FinCEN requirements, if you aren't MSB licensed, then the bit-coin transfer amount specifically as a money transfer is $0.  So people buying and selling bit-coins specifically to buy or sell them on to someone else are in fact breaking federal law and face prosecution for it.  In addition to the state laws that require registration as an MSB, etc.
And again, this would qualify as money laundering if you know that the purpose of the bit coins is for illegal purpose.  Charlie Shrem knows all about this.

And if you convert all your money to BTC, how do you make large purchases? You could irreversibly destroy the market if you needed to repair your car.
And just how many merchants are accepting BTC? From my understanding, the entire bit-coin economy of Venezuela is tiny, and there are very few, next to no, merchants of any type that accept it. Let me ask again, how are you converting your BTC to USD/VEF? I imagine that is hurting your "earnings" a lot more than you think.

That is terrible advice.  Colloidal silver exhibits no safe activity.  Silver is a naturally antibiotic surface, but that's because it is non-porous and does not hold minerals.  Smearing it on your body or consuming it does nothing.    And it's definitely not the "most potent anti-microbial."    Gamma rays are more effective.... Heat... Mitochondrial inhibitors... Really, just about anything.  Spores do survive on silver's surface.

If you're going to call anything inefficient, you should definitely not use bit-coin as a counter example.  It is the single most inefficient protocol in the world, by design.   And, by speed, bit-coin has a max TPS of 2.7, whereas Visa alone can process more than 10,000 TPS.  The products are not really expensive, the price is set based on what people are willing to pay. 
If you want to send a dollar to your friend in India, WU will allow you to do that, so will PayPal, though I don't see how remittance relates to transactions.

I assumed that was what you meant by "With credit cards you have no choice."  My apologies, I misconstrued what you meant.  
But, that begs the question of the analogy between USD/CC providers and BTC/BTC service providers.  Neither USD nor BTC inherently provides any fraud protection, etc, it's the services built on top of these that offer those products.  So, in reality, CC providers have done exactly what your saying next level services will do for bit-coin, and the market has already accepted those costs.

You mean USD tripled in value vs vef.  How do you get USD for bits? Why would you not just hold USD? It's value against vef goes up consistently while btc:USD has gone way down for the past 18months.   In fact, if you had spent the 500 for the s5 on USD, you'd have actually gone from  7500vef to 22500vef if you held usd. Thats much better than the 60% or so decline in the last year for btc.

Structuring is a very specific crime, if you just deposit all your funds at once, no matter the amount, it's not illegal.  Structuring isn't necessarily illegal either, it requires intent.  If I got 3000$ per day for 4 days for some reason, and deposited it at the end of every day, I would normally be in the "reportable" realm and would potentially be accused of structuring.  If I say or show that I couldn't have deposited the total at once, that would not be a problem.
Really, it's pretty hard to run afoul of most of the AML/KYC laws as a common consumer.

Not for trading, you can be prosecuted for selling bit-coin that you specifically bought in order to sell to someone else.  That's money transmission, which requires a license.

Structuring is a criminal issue.  And the seizure of money under structuring isn't done through traditional civil asset forfeiture (since it's a criminal issue afterall).  The structuring law itself provides for the seizure of any funds that were used to structure.

Your analogy fell apart right in the middle again.  The CEO's job is to hire people and delegate tasks.  He delegated a task to you, that doesn't mean you get to delegate it down further, it means you have to do it.   That's responsibility.   And, if I ever had an employee tell me they outsourced a job so they could work on a different one that they deemed more important, they'd be on their ass very quick.    In your above scenario, "creat[ing] the most profit" would happen by firing your dumb ass and employing your sub-contractor for the original wage you were giving himto do what I was paying you to do.  Congratulations, you just proved why I don't need you.
Likewise, in academia, your professor is your boss.  They give you a task to do, and it's your's to do.  Presumably because it will help you in some way or help prove that you know what you're supposed to know.  Delegating this would be completely unacceptable.   The tasks your professors give to you supposedly come from some other source (Like the industry analysts, or research, best practices, etc) that would be even better informed about what things you may need to know in order to be successful.  Going to college just to get the piece of paper is such a waste, if you didn't learn anything, than you did not use your time properly and should have just bought a diploma from a mill.  College is equal parts learning how to learn as it is establishing a foundation on which you can build to learn how to do the job you ultimately get.  THAT is why most jobs require experience, because they don't feel like teaching some wet behind the ears entitled little shit how to do the job they were hired to do from scratch.

I think I may be able to explain.  But, let me first define some things.
BTC is bit-coin on the Bitcoin network.  LNC is bit-coin on the LN.
Now, every LNC must be represented by a BTC on the original chain right? Or else, people could just generate LNC somehow, or there'd be fraud, etc.
So, someone sends some BTC to a specific address which locks that amount, like a safe, and they then get some LNC to transact with.  Of important note, the BTC sent can be any value &gt; miner's fee, and the locked amount would be the amount that becomes spendable on LN.  Let's say the net is 500 Satoshis, which we'll call 500 LNC on the LN network.
Now, they send the LNC about willy nilly.  Eventually, someone wants to withdraw that back out.  (Also, I believe in the white paper if you don't CLOSE a channel before it expires, all money returns to its original source, so you MUST close a channel at some time.)
Now, In order to close it, the LNC must be translated back to BTC.  The amount of BTC I "locked" originally was 500 satoshis; way below miner's fees.  For someone to get those, an entire transaction would have to be generated just moving my 500 satoshis on bit-coin network to their bit-coin address.    This isn't really possible.
If that's not possible, then closing the channel isn't possible.  And, I've also effectively denied the ability to close the channel.  So, if you only had one "LN address" anyone malicious actor could shut you out of the entire economy for the low cost of bit-coin miner's fee + 1 satoshi ( 1S -&gt; 1LNC -&gt; send to you, prevents closing of entire channel).

Save your breath, you aren't going to convince me of anything because I don't deny that there are problems.  But what you're advocating is definitely not a solution, it's just you trying to justify it in some way in your head.

And again, your last sentence barely conveys a thought.
