No, if you buy with a limit order you won’t have any fees for transaction!

I did not know that and will contact GDAX to work it out. Thank you for pointing it out!

I know. ‘If it looks too good to be true, it is too good to be true’. Learned the hard way. 
But I am really a wishfull thinker and because he had a few transactions I trusted. And on top of that, I though if he doesn’t give me the money, I can easily cancel the trade. But I was wrong....

Deposit money on Coinbase. (Through bank transfer, because it doesn’t have a fee). After that you can transfer your money to GDAX(exchange) and buy Bitcoin without fees if you use limit orders. Go on YouTube and search for buying through GDAX without fees and you’ll see plenty videos explaining it!

Yes! I am transferring funds to Coinbase via bank transfers in Europe. After I got my money transferred to GDAX from Coinbase, I buy some BTC. After that I can transfer it to my hardware wallet for free! 
Edit; the ‘yes’ was not meant for buying from anycoin, because I don’t know how they work

Tried to sell btc for cash. Put the btc in escrow. Buyer didn’t meet the standards for me(I couldn’t verify the money because he arrived too late) and is now claiming he gave me the money and I took off with the btc in escrow....
