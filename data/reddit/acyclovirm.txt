There is out there, a good alternative, not Wavecrest holdings or VISA, : ePayments; this is not just a prepaid Master Card debit card, ePayments is a complete payment sytem, it lets you transfer between ePayments and bank accounts, fees are by far, very fair; you are able to fund the account/debit card, whit bank accounts, cryptocurrencies like: ETH, BTC, BCH, LTC and if is not even enough; you are able to buy cryptos in app (iOs Android); the only downside, i have seen till now, is that you cant fund directly from exchanges, because you previously have to generate the payment in app or in the website, if generated payment is lower or higher, transaction will be declined, fortunatelly, funds will be returned to sender (mainnet fees apply) debit card works wolrdwide.
If you want, could use my referal link:

Regarding to Wavecrest Holdings and VISA BTC prepaid cards ban; an option arises; **WageCan GOLDEN**, a rechargeable prepaid card with BTC or BCH, whit a good option to temporary storage for the funds in an independ wallet, so when the market will be bullish, you will be able to add funds the prepaid card in USD.
However  card is not exactly the cheapest, indeed is a little bit expensive, but is a good option, the cost includes express shipping by DHL, and the issuance. Get 20% off here:
