BitGo is supposed to apply limits / logic to requests, although those are likely configurable by BFX.  Based on what has been said so far, either the limits were very poorly set (such as a 'limit' of infinity), or the hacker gained access to change the bitgo limits, or the transactions were structured in some way to avoid the limits.

The danger is if coins can be come tainted by whos hands they've passsed thorugh, you can never know if the coins *you* are currently holding might end up being marked as tainted at some later point and rendered worthless.
Much like if you get money from an ATM, let it sit in your wallet for a month, and find out that 2 weeks after the withdrawl the bills were linked to a robbery -- you now lost your currently through no fault of your own. 
In other words, coins have to remain fungible or else every coin will need to have a 'title search' done on it before transfer and a discount applied to its value based on the chance it'll become tainted while in your possession.  That means the older a coin is the riskier it will be to hold it.

I am not familiar with bitgo's mechanisms, but if I were designing it I would require a completely separate set of credentials to log in and make a limit change, plus 2FA.  If BFX significantly oops'd and left a copy of their limit-credentials AND 2fa enrollment secret around then a hacker could make that kind of change.  In that scenario it would be on BFX for exposing their limit-adjustment creds.
On the other hand, if bitgo does not offer a mechanism to prevent the transaction-generating api key from updating limits, that is a major design failure on bitgo's side. If they do offer it yet BFX configured the transaction-api key to have that capability, that is on BFX.

The wallets hold the private keys, not the bitcoins themselves --- the coins are only an artifact of the blockchain ledger having a coin history  back to their genesis that results in addresses controlled by your keys having current control of them.

I think it is likely he has been given some boilerplate language by the company lawyers that admits the least liability, and he can't say anything that commits them to anything past that, but since the final course of action hasn't been announced he can't definitively confirm or deny that stance. 
Given the dollar amount involved, it is somewhat surprising he is allowed to post anything as he might inadvertently make a commitment that works against BFX later. In that respects it is nice to get any details at all.

At this point 'potentially insecure' means it could possibly be instantly subverted, which would make a bad situation much worse. It'd be a race against your withdrawal and the hackers.

The config keys (if they exist) should never touch a reachable system, so should be a significant hurdle. The API keys necessarily must be accessible to the user-facing systems.
Knowing who of bitgo/bfx is responsible will require knowing the details of how their interactions were configured.

So they can hold it forever even if the laptop was 'lost'?  Unlikely. They'll deduct a very pessimistic estimate of the cost to replace the laptop instead.
Its specious to say they are holding the entire check due to the value of the data on the laptop (unless its the only copy, but then that was a bad idea from the beginning) as return of the laptop in no way ensures the data was not copied beforehand.

There's also the time-to-propagate issue for the miners. In that scenario think of it is hitting the ticket window outside the turnstiles for the train.   Your ticket says the next 'expected' train at 12:10pm, but if it takes you on average more than 10 minutes to get through the line (ie download the latest block), you'll miss your train and have to try again.
Another way, miners want to work on the longest chain to avoid orphans (working on a chain that is a dead-end; if you extend this chain you aren't going to get paid).   If someone else has lengthened the chain but you aren't aware of it, you are wasting effort. If the time it takes you to get the latest blocks is too long, you'll never extend the chain yourself for the block reward. There is some concern this mechanism will give an edge to large players with very fast connections to each other and edge out the 'de' in decentralized currency.

The bitcoin mining difficulty is self-calibrating to take approximately 10 minutes per block. It looks like from one source that 6 blocks were completed in 6 minutes, which is pretty fast.  
It is most likely an aberration, or perhaps someone has found a shortcut for calculating blocks / brought online a massive amount of hardware or some other bitcoin-world-shaking scenario.

'Refund Processing Service' you are paying them to set up a bank account for you or populate a debit card and send it to you.  No reason to do this if you already have a bank account.  I've also seen this kind of fee when you are asking them to issue you a loan against your refund, aka 'instant refunds'.
If you choose the next option up you get the same results w/o the $34 fee and the IRS will deposit direct into your account.

If a transaction has not yet been mined, you can attempt to replace the transaction by broadcasting another one with a higher fee.  Miners will prefer the transaction with a higher fee.  RBF gives you a chance to fix an 'oops', but it also makes double-spending much easier.  
For example, if purchasing Reddit Gold w/Bitcoin, you could submit the transaction and get the gold, then RBF/double-spend the money back to yourself.  If Reddit doesn't notice this then you have the gold and they don't have the bitcoin.
Once the transaction has been mined then RBF has no effect.

I'd guess that a storm sufficient to wipe out all unhardened magnetic media across the globe would cause such upheaval that we'd be back to a barter system or using ammunition for currency -- the global economy would be gone. I doubt the internet in general would survive that.
If that level of interruption is a real concern one could probably work out a way to write every block out as it is confirmed to a blueray. Maybe talk to the people at [

If someone is 'storing' the coins then they have the keys.
You might consider something like GreenAddress.it where both parties keys have to be part of the transaction.  A hack against any one party does not result in coin loss (though you lose your coins if you lose your keys).  They protect against the 'service implodes' scenario by sending you an encrypted  presigned NLOCKTIME transaction so you can recover the coins after a predetermined time period if GreenAddress disappears.

Are there a lot of garbage transactions flooding the system that can legitimately be ignored? Otherwise all raising the fee does (in the macro sense) is cause someone 'else' to come here saying their transaction didn't process.
It could be the goal is to let the price of on-chain transactions increase to make it desirable to use off-chain mechanisms that reconcile up to the chain.

Expired certificates are not protection in the same manner as expired drivers licenses are not valid identification. The encryption properties of the certificate don't cease to exist at expiration, assuming that the signatures are otherwise valid. There is though a higher risk that the cert is not controlled by the correct parties.
Someone _could_ intentionally fake a cert with bogus signatures and a recent expiration in the hopes you'll see the recent expiration and bypass the warning, executing a Man-In-The-Middle attack.
Expiration dates are (aside from a revenue stream for CAs) there to limit the time window when a stolen certificate can be successfully used.  A former site admin may have copied a cert upon departure and try to use it at a later date.
Given the potential risk of irrevocable bitcoin loss, it would be best to avoid use of the site until the certificate is updated. It would be even better if the site posted something (after renewal) confirming that their cert expired but that it was still in their control during that time.

Their SSL cert has a 'not before' validity date of today, so at a guess they updated the cert before publishing to the the [OCSP]( system (used to check if a cert has been revoked), and Firefox flagged that as something to worry about. 
[Qualsys]( shows that the ssl cert is good at this time,so if you are still seeing the error I'd be concerned about malware on your machine.

Not necessarily. [ describes the concept.  Providing a vendor with a link to your bank account gives them significant access. They'll have permission to pull money out and you'll be in the hole while you fight it out with them.     An example of where this might come up is say a disputed transaction of some kind; perhaps they'd elect to recover the amount out of your linked account -- and there'd surely be justification for that in their T&amp;Cs.  (This is a hypothetical and I don't know if they have that in their T&amp;Cs or a process to do so; only to illustrate a possible scenario). 
There's also the 'hack' scenario where someone might subvert either coinbase in general or just your account and transfer all your cash into coinbase and out again over BTC.
So having a bank account that doesn't have access to your life savings that could be hoovered up in a misunderstanding could be beneficial for you.

When making an offer on a house it is customary to put up 'earnest money', which is forfeit to the seller if certain conditions are met.  The earnest money prevents a buyer from stringing a seller along indefinitely without recourse.  Otherwise a buyer could put an offer on a house, draw out closing, and if the housing market depreciates in that time then cancel the deal.  This would be very disruptive on a mass scale.
It also reimburses the seller for having to carry the cost of the house until a new buyer / deal is completed.
