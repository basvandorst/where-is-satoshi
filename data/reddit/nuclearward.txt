It's funny how bitcoiners insist bitcoin is something completely different from current systems but insist it has to operate exactly like previous systems in order to work...

Liquidity is not a problem if its a stable platform. What's ~~36~~12 hours in the grand scheme f things...

This isn't any other market. If it guaranteed stability it would dis incentivize market manipulators. It would be a system that was extremely unspeaking to people trying to game it. Even 12 hours would probably be large enough to fend off the jackals.

If it guarantees that the price won't be flash manipulated i would be 100% ok with this. The only people I see having a problem with this are those that want to treat this like a penny stock.

False. Making the currency stable would incentivize longterm users and sis incentivize short term manipulators. The price of something should not fluctuate 45% in a day if this is to be used as a real currency...
