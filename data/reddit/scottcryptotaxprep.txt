Look at the big picture. We are still way up from this time last year. Don't let your emotions get the best of you. Zoom out

Please don't memorize the seed. You're setting yourself up for disaster. We are all biased to think we have a good memory. Memory is actually not reliable at all - no matter how good you think yours is.
Another poster mentioned you could get in an accident and receive head trauma. I agree that is definitely something to consider.
@_date: 2019-11-11 23:53:03
Yes. Just keep very detailed records to avoid problems come tax season. Apps like Delta, Blockfolio, or Cointracking are wonderful and will save you a lot of time and stress down the road.

There will probably be a point where even 1 BTC is life-changing
@_date: 2019-11-05 01:02:35
I'd like to add a few points - most of these are more relevant for US investors but the principles still apply more broadly.
* Make sure you keep detailed records of your trades. Ensure all exchanges you use have adequate record keeping. Come tax season you will need complete trading histories or it's going to cause major headaches.
* Make sure you report your crypto activity to tax authorities. This is how you protect your hard-earned gains. Don't lose money to interest and penalties for underreporting or making mistakes.
* Consult a tax expert before making assumptions about crypto taxation. It is more complex than it appears on first glance. Many people got insanely wrecked with massive tax bills in 2017 because they did not realize crypto-to-crypto trading constitutes a taxable event (in the US). They could not cash out to pay their tax bills because their altcoins became worthless.
* Don't try to hide your crypto activity or avoid taxation. You will be caught and the penalties will be severe. It is not worth it. Report your activity as accurately as possible.
* Use a hardware wallet *if you are technically competent enough and have somewhere safe to store the seed offline*. In the event that you are not able to fulfill these requirements, please consider using a more secure, **domestic** exchange such as Gemini to store your coins. Do not store coins in foreign exchanges under any circumstances - they disappear with everyone's crypto more often than you'd think.
* Thoroughly research any coins before investment and don't listen to 'influencers' in the space shilling coins. They are being paid behind the scenes and don't have your best interest in mind. Do your own research.
* Anyone promising you a return is lying. There is no such thing as a 3000% guaranteed return in crypto. You can not 3x your money overnight. No one will give you 100 ETH for sending them 0.1 ETH. If it sounds too good to be true, **IT IS**. Scams are rampant in this space - arm yourself with the knowledge to resist them when greed comes knocking on your door and clouds your judgment. Be resilient.
* Don't let emotions get the best of you (it will be hard), thoroughly contemplate your decisions, and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
* Do not use leverage under any circumstance unless you are a professional trader
* Enjoy this once in a lifetime opportunity!

I think they're going to co-exist and complement each other nicely. Bitcoin will soon be usable on Ethereum DeFi in a decentralized way ([tBTC]( This will allow liquidity from Bitcoin markets to be utilized with financial instruments developed and implemented on Ethereum.
Ethereum is gaining traction in the enterprise community. Check out the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and who is involved there - some pretty big names. Ernst and Young has been a big contributor in this area throughout 2019 - check out Nightfall
The future is bright for both IMO.
@_date: 2019-11-20 04:29:45
No. But you will need to check 'yes' to the new crypto question on the 1040. It asks whether you've ever purchased, sold, or otherwise obtained any digital currencies. Even if you've never sold, you should say yes.

Just buy BTC with the money instead. You'll be better off. Mining Bitcoin is not profitable anymore for 99% of people unless you have free or extremely low cost electricity.

This. I work in the crypto tax industry and I've had countless clients lose life changing amounts of Bitcoin from schemes just like this. 
'Cloud mining' and similar services are a total fraud. The whole notion is technically infeasible and obviously a scam to anyone who has done a few hours of research into mining hardware, profitability, and hashing power. 
99% of clients I've had never received a single Satoshi back. Some were paid out for a period of time but were never able to withdraw their funds. I never had a single client out of dozens who actually received anything close to what the packages had cost. I had a few clients lose 7-10 BTC on this trash. No one deserves that.
These ponzi schemes are so easy to fall for and are rampant in the space. They will be even more prominent during the next bull run. 
Stay safe out there.
@_date: 2019-11-07 04:55:42

I went to a Bitcoin meetup tonight. There was a guy there who was shilling an obvious Ponzi scheme called youbank. I hadn't heard of this one before but it's clearly up and coming. Please stay FAR away from it and anyone associated with this 'company'. The whole thing is super sketchy.
@_date: 2019-11-15 19:41:32
Not worth it unless you want to write off the loss for tax purposes or something. But even then, $100 won't help you much. I recommend holding strong. DCA if you want to lower your cost average.
@_date: 2019-11-24 01:59:57
I love this strategy. It is so satisfying to wake up and see your limit filled - especially when the price has already recovered since the fill.

Concerned? Nope. Not at all.
@_date: 2019-11-07 05:37:43
You did the right thing. Things won't end well for OP if they truly are not reporting income received in Bitcoin or capital gains.

How do these banks go down so often? Are they running off dollar store server infrastructure?
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:48:50
This will be huge - hope people actually use it or they'll just shutter it like most websites that have accepted Bitcoin in the past.
@_date: 2019-11-04 04:38:39
Make sure you research crypto taxation or talk to an expert. Things can get messy pretty quick and you want to do it right from the beginning.
@_date: 2019-11-03 06:31:32
The dilemma is security. If you can be trusted to maintain important data (wallet seed), your Bitcoins are significantly safer in a wallet controlled by you rather than a centralized entity like Robinhood. 
Robinhood may be engaging in risky activity with your Bitcoin. They may not actually purchase 100% of the Bitcoin they owe their clients. Market forces may lead them into trouble down the road and present a situation where they would not be able to back their 'holdings'. 
In addition, they do not allow withdrawals or deposits which leads to further suspicion that they do not hold all the Bitcoin they sell to users. Essentially, there is no way to interact with your Bitcoin outside of their platform and therefore it is not Bitcoin at all. It is some pseudo-Bitcoin derivative that is bought and traded exclusively by users of their platform.

They're just memeing the 4chan meme that predicted 16k BTC in Oct. Didn't happen of course
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:14:18
I'm thinking the same thing. The fundamentals are getting stronger day by day. The writing is on the wall.
@_date: 2019-11-17 03:57:59
That's awesome! Make sure you keep track of the bitcoin donations so you can report them on your taxes. 
It must feel great to have players appreciate your work enough to donate.
@_date: 2019-11-11 23:37:08
This sounds awesome. I would be interested in learning more. One important feature to include would be a complete transaction history so that users could easily determine how much BTC income they made come tax season.
@_date: 2019-11-17 04:19:04
I recommend starting with a U.S. based exchange like Gemini (ActiveTrader) or Coinbase (Pro). These are probably the easiest platforms to get going. They also have decent security and are the most regulated exchanges out there. I recommend researching hardware wallets and why it's important to use one (once you have an amount of Bitcoin that would hurt to lose). Crypto is a space that requires skepticism. Don't trust the exchanges to protect your money for you. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. With that said, if you HAVE to keep money on an exchange - make sure it is a U.S. based exchange like Coinbase or Gemini. Those are way safer than foreign exchanges. There have been many foreign exchanges that have exit-scammed their clients or got hacked.
Right now, Bitcoin is mostly used for speculation. It's also used for payments and some people in the space even take their salary in Bitcoin. Most people in the space view Bitcoin as a store of value, akin to digital gold. It was created to be a decentralized and trustless peer-to-peer payments system.
I would recommend regularly buying small amounts of bitcoin here and there, accumulating over time. This is called cost averaging. Define a time period that you want to hold it for and stick to it. Make a plan. Don't trade on emotion. Don't buy BTC with money you can't afford to lose. Don't get suckered into sh\*tcoin scams or social media hoaxes. Scams are rampant in the space, especially on social media (looking at you, Twitter). DO NOT TRUST ANYONE.
Be aware that there are non-trivial tax implications when Bitcoin is sold or exchanged for another cryptocurency. While buying Bitcoin with USD is not a taxable event, be aware that selling Bitcoin back to fiat or even to another crypto qualifies as a capital event (assuming you are a US taxpayer). Please do some due diligence after buying your first bitcoin so that you can trade with taxes in mind. Not only will this make you a better trader but it will save you money and  trouble down the road. Keep detailed records of your purchases and trades, you'll need them.
Good luck, have fun.
@_date: 2019-11-07 05:00:59
Just make sure you hold on to it for a while, preferably a year or longer. This way you can pay long-term capital gains tax on any profits down the road (assuming you are in the U.S.). You're also more likely to see price appreciation with a longer time horizon.
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:30:27
I would immediately change your email password as well as any platform you may have shared your Bitpay password with. It's quite possible someone had hacked your email and got the notification of the transfer to your wallet. Always use 2FA when available (non-SMS based method).
Sorry this happened to you. Good luck

This. I was just at a Bitcoin meetup the other night and there was a guy there pitching an obvious ponzi scheme. It was disgusting and a lot of people were eating it up. Obviously I challenged him, but these people just come back at you with word salad that confuses the noobs. Fortunately I work in the crypto tax industry and have seen soo many clients lose life-changing amounts of Bitcoin to these schemes. Be careful out there and don't trust anyone you aren't already close with.
@_date: 2019-11-07 02:56:26
You are able to withdraw your Bitcoin but you have to verify your identity first. At least it's better than Robinhood
@_date: 2019-11-07 05:37:03
As much as the IRS guidelines are not ideal, let's not promote tax evasion here..

Elon Musk is one of those people that children will read about in their history books in the future. It's pretty cool to step back and realize we are living through this Bitcoin revolution / Tesla / SpaceX era. I don't always agree with him but think it's awesome he's on Bitcoin's side.

Whoa, I would have never expected this. Does anyone know if he's into crypto?
@_date: 2019-10-30 23:35:43
Although I am bullish long term on Bitcoin it's hard to say that it will hit 100k by a certain date. Maybe the Stock-to-flow model will play out as expected...but maybe not..? You never know how certain events are going to affect price (USDT collapse, unexpected bug, etc)
Good luck to anyone buying this. I hope it pays off - sounds risky.
@_date: 2019-10-30 23:35:13
It's beautiful - would be cool if they kept it around!

This is great news and will hopefully further increase Segwit adoption. I can't believe Bitfinex actually did something decent for once. Definitely took them long enough. My hope is that the many other exchanges holding out will follow

I don't understand why everyone thought that Bakkt would achieve some massive mindblowing  volume in its first week. Obviously it's going to take some time for institutional clients to be on-boarded.
IMO, it's only going to get more active from here. We are finally seeing steady growth in daily contract purchases and it has't taken as long as I had expected.
Whether Bakkt is actually good for Bitcoin or not remains to be seen. There's some talk of ICE's owners being heavily involved with the Trump administration, who wants to kill Bitcoin's price ([relevant]( but who knows if this claim is reasonable or not.
@_date: 2019-10-30 23:27:02
I would not recommend using leverage in this market if you are interested in keeping your money. As others have said, buy low, sell high. Try to DCA in on a regular interval if you are eager to get invested.
@_date: 2019-10-31 00:12:33
I have asked several tax professionals who are well-connected at the IRS about this and the consensus among them is that there is a near-zero probability that the taxation of crypto-crypto transactions will ever go away. The reason is that the IRS wants their cut and there is a lot of money to be made.
The only scenario I can imagine in which this might go away would be if US dominance in the space is at serious risk due to more favorable regulations in other developed nations. Even then, I'm not sure if this would sway opinions in Congress and the Executive branch.
The IRS has made it clear that it would rather continue trying to squeeze crypto into existing tax frameworks than create an innovation-driving framework from the bottom-up that addresses the specific use cases behind cryptocurrencies. Perhaps we will get this someday, but I would be greatly surprised if it were soon.
This is one of the biggest obstacles to adoption in the USA. Hopefully the government will wake up and do something once China releases their statecoin.
One possibility that I hope to see one day is a de minimis exception that would allow tax-free transactions under a certain dollar threshold. Not ideal, but it would be better than what we have going now.

I will echo others and say Andreas. He is definitely the unofficial spokesman - at least as far as the tech goes. I think he has done the most other than Satoshi to bring developers into the community - which is critical to the success of this experiment. He has also done a lot to increase adoption by explaining Bitcoin to laypeople in a manner that helps them fully realize the potential impact of Bitcoin.

Gemini Activetrader is another good option.

I want to echo the other comments and strongly discourage the use of Robinhood. They had some very serious price fluctuations at critical moments during the last run that other, higher-volume and more sophisticated exchanges did not experience. As others have said, you cannot withdrawal any of your Bitcoin and therefore you don't control the keys. For all we know they could be lending out their bitcoin holdings or doing something crazy behind the scenes that puts your funds at risk. 
I personally recommend Gemini (ActiveTrader), Coinbase Pro, or Cash App if you really want something easy to use. Kraken is also a great exchange but they unfortunately don't have ACH bank transfers in place.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:45:47
I transfer whenever it becomes an amount of money that I'm not willing to lose by keeping it on the exchange. It's up to you what that amount is and how often you want to do it. I would consider doing it as soon as possible if the exchange does not have withdrawal fees (e.g. Coinbase Pro or Gemini). If they do, you can let it accumulate for a bit before transferring it to your wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-08 18:41:55
Man I'm shook. Someone called me out on my new reddit account
I wish you luck on your taxes. Keep trying to outsmart the IRS. I'm sure it will work out well for you. I work in the  crypto tax industry and have seen people get audited and have their lives destroyed for not reporting crypto. Trying to warn the community that it isn't worth it.
If you want to lose all your gains and pay interest penalties that compound daily, go ahead.
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:55:56
No one should keep significant funds on exchanges. I understand the need for some to trade, but at least distribute the risk across different platforms. Don't get burned. Learn from those who learned the hard way. Investing in a hardware wallet is one of the smartest things you can do to protect your crypto.
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:50:10
Good luck with that. It's your money until they empty your bank account and garnish your wages.
@_date: 2019-12-10 23:00:15
This is not correct (at least in the US). Each transaction is taxable regardless of whether or not the proceeds are withdrawn from the exchange.
Both crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat trades are taxable relative to the USD value at the time of transaction. These transactions are considered capital events and capital gain taxation rules apply.
Even if you never withdraw from Kraken, you're making profits or losses on your trades and they must be reported. Consult an expert, get all your trades reconciled, and then report any gain/loss to the IRS.
