Hypothetically if you had a bot that was trading between shitcoins making maybe 100-500 trades a day for about 2 years, what gets taxed?

THANKS YOU MAN FOR THAT!!! I've seriously been looking for that on and off for about 2 years. I read it a long time ago but then I couldn't recall the name nor the source. Thank you so much!

This is particularly interesting. As OP pointed out with the correct algorithm you can produce CP out of anything.

Rather be greedy than a totalitarian douchebag. Stop trying to control everyone's life.

The logical conclusion to the problem is that we must ban blockchains. The problem isn't in bitcoin, it's blockchains themselves. This means that numerous financial industry companies that are beginning to incorporate blockchains into their record keeping should probably stop.

Why do you assume it settles on 12k? Also they aren't scared of BTC they are scared of a stateless currency that can be stored on an individual's computer or smartphone and traded between two people in a digital format in seconds that doesn't rely on some sort of credit card or institutional trust system. BTC is the leak that collapses the damn. They are just resistant to change. Crypto is gonna destroy banking hegemony as it is today.

So my cognitive dissonance is telling me that drop might be over. Prior drops didn't have the main stream popularity that BTC has gained since them. There is a lot of people watching this and in the grand scheme and 30% drop on BTC isn't such a huge loss, especially since a lot of people were expecting this. Personally I don't think we are far from the equilibrium price. If you are planning to put 5k in I would ask what you are comfortable losing if it drops. IE on gdax it is around 2100 atm which means at 5k a 500 dollar dip is 5000/2100*1600 or a loss of 1200 dollars. If you can afford that loss in the short term I personally believe BTC is likely to climb again above the current prices.

Sorry bout the late reply. I like coinbase thus far. If you setup your bank account you can do a purchase right away, however the coin is locked in at that price for 7 days while they bill your bank account. If you plan on holding a coin for more than a week that works. Also there is a 5k/week limit on the first month. Once the coin is on your account there is a free instant transfer to the GDAX exchange where you can trade quickly, if you want there is also access to websockets and API for GDAX. Only down side is their graphs suck, or I don't understand why, but they are constantly bugging out, so if you have a bit of programming skills it's best to write a small programs to monitor prices yourself. Last thing the fees on the exhcange are maker-taker 0 maker and .3% downwards for taker depending on your 30 trade volume. 
Also if you want to store your coin you can move it into your wallet
