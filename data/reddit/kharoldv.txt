lol have fun with dirty coins then. They can be swapped back for bitcoin. No point giving him bad advice, bruh.

It's a nice idea. I was thinking about setting up a store.

The fees for that amount will surely be less than $20. The last time I did this I lost less than that for a larger amount. I can't remember the percentages off the top of my head but they were very reasonable.

Bitcoin tumbling doesn't work. Swap them to XMR and back.

The official one from getmonero.org. No hate from me but I fear you're correct. Everyone needs to remember that Bitcoin isn't anonymous. When it comes down to freedom we all need to evolve. With blockchain analysis they can un-mix BTC quite easily.

I mean unless you're trying to clean lots of dirty coin I don't really think it would matter to you. But I wouldn't skip cleaning them just to be sure. Swap them to XMR and back using shapeshift or something similar.

None of them. BTC &gt; XMR &gt; BTC is the way to go.

I don't know about CoinJoin in particular but traditional mixing services don't work because of blockchain analysis. The recent WallStreet market bust reports confirm this.
Edit: Wrong link

After having read through it again, it doesn't get technical but yes i think that's the idea. From the criminal complaint:


marketplaces derive from a proprietary program that analyzes 
financial transactions on the Blockchain (the public-facing 
online ledger of Bitcoin transactions) and that can identify 
groups of addresses that associate with darknet marketplaces.  
Law enforcement has used proprietary services offered by 
Blockchain analysis companies to investigate Bitcoin 
transactions.  Through numerous unrelated investigations, the 
analytics tool provided by the company here has been found to be 
reliable. 
I haven't looked into CoinJoin specifically so I'll take your word for that.

Every single day i'll tell you guys the same. BTC &gt; XMR &gt; BTC is the only safe way. Cops or shills will downvote everytime but do your research.

morphtoken.com for BTC &gt; XMR. 
xmr.to for XMR &gt; BTC.
If you're using Tor you might need to get a new identity if you're blocked. Just keep doing that until you find one that works. Simple to use and the fees are good.

We all know Bitcoin is pseudonymous, as well as Monero being the privacy coin. There are other exchanges and services to swap for XMR and back. I'm not telling him to cash out using an exchange tied to his identity. He can use a service to swap them, another one to swap them back if he likes, with a privately held XMR wallet being a step after the initial exchange there's literally no way to know who he is.
