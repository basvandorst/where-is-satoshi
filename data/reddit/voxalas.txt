And we're still cheaper and faster than BTC ;)

Also everyone that's "realized their profits" regrets pulling out, cryptos aren't even close to stopping their climb

0% APR for 12 months. I'll let you know when that time gets close.

Thank you for being kind. I am 100% aware of how crazy it sounds to take a loan on speculation. But every year for the last 5 I've been like damn, shoulda put money in crypto last year. Time has come to be on the other side of the shitposts

Ok but no matter what if you had just held on to them at those points they would be worth 10k each right now. Every year it is so bull that's it at least doubles in value. So the "bear" dips don't really matter.

I've been telling myself this every year for the past 6. Bull it remains.

one ted talk dude referred to it as the pre-distribution of wealth. of course its a gamble but if you see the value in the tech, it could be exactly that. only time will tell
